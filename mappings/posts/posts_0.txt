But the big winner was found in second place as the book-based drama The Help soared above expectations – and all the other new releases – delivering a sensational opening weekend ahead of what could be a very long run in theaters. The 3D horror sequel Final Destination 5 and the action-comedy 30 Minutes or Less both scored decent debuts but the concert doc Glee Live! 3D was dead on arrival landing outside of the top ten.Simian rule continued for a second weekend as Rise of the Planet of the Apes grossed an estimated $27.5M in its second outing falling 50% which was admirable for a sci-fi franchise film. After ten days, the Fox release boosted its total to a solid $104.9M and could be headed for the neighborhood of $175M by the end of its domestic run. That would put it with Thor and Captain America as the summer’s biggest non-sequel action films, and the only one not in 3D. Apes spread into much of the world this weekend taking in $40.5M from 40 markets lifting the overseas cume to $75M and the worldwide tally to $179.9M heading towards the $400M mark. The reported budget was $93M.Easily beating all other new titles and almost reaching the heights of Apes was the period drama The Help which opened with an estimated $25.5M from 2,534 locations for a muscular $10,073, the best per-theater average for any film in wide release. With its early Wednesday launch, the PG-13 film about wealthy white women in 1960s Mississippi and their black maids has taken in a stellar $35.4M in its first five days. It was adapted from a best-selling book with a built-in audience. But this weekend is just the tip of the iceberg as Help‘s positive reviews, Oscar buzz, and incredible A+ CinemaScore indicate healthy legs into the fall season. Films aimed at adult women in August can often go on to finish with four or five times their opening weekend figure, but Help may just be more durable. Viola Davis, Emma Stone, and Bryce Dallas Howard star.In just five days, the civil rights story has already matched the seven-week gross of a more high profile summer film that also targeted older adults – Larry Crowne starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. As expected, mature women made up the bulk of the audience for Help. Studio research showed that 60% of the crowd was over 35 and 74% was female. Disney did, however, report that the male share has increased everyday since opening. The Help looks on track to race past the $100M mark, especially if the final film releases of the summer fail to excite adult women. That would allow it to outgross such mega-budgeted summer films as Cowboys &amp; Aliens and Green Lantern. Help cost only $25M to produce.The four-week late-summer parade of horror movies kicked off with the 3D sequel Final Destination 5 which debuted to an estimated $18.4M in third place. Averaging a respectable $5,832 from 3,155 sites, the latest R-rated installment in the eleven-year-old fright franchise delivered the third best (or third worst) opening for the series as the 2000 and 2003 chapters premiered lower while the most recent two pics opened better. In fact, each film delivered a better bow than its predecessor until now with 2009’s 3D entry The Final Destination reaching series highs with a $27.4M debut and $66.5M total.The meat of the summer season usually doesn’t see too many horror films and this year was no different. Priest from mid-May was the last fright flick but now the genre returns with next weekend’s Fright Night (also in 3D) followed by Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark on August 26 and then Shark Night 3D over Labor Day weekend. Final Destination 5 did prompt audiences to spend more for extra dimensional scares as a whopping 76% of the gross came from 3D screens putting it at a higher rate than this summer’s action films that were in the format. Still, being a five-quel with another 3D horror pic attacking on its second weekend, death will come quickly in the coming weeks.Enjoying the lowest decline among all wide releases, The Smurfs followed in fourth with an estimated $13.5M for a low 35% drop. Smurfette and company broke the century mark on Sunday after 17 days and finished the weekend with an impressive $101.5M. Positive buzz from families and an utter lack of competition for kids has allowed the Sony hit to excel. Overseas audiences are loving The Smurfs too as the kidpic banked an explosive $60M bumping Harry Potter from the top of the international marketplace after a four-week reign. With $141M overseas and $242.5M worldwide to date, the global tally looks well on its way to $450M or more.Opening in fifth place with mediocre results was the buddy comedy 30 Minutes or Less with an estimated $13M from 2,888 locations for a $4,501 average. The R-rated film about two buddies forced by criminals to rob a bank for them stars Jesse Eisenberg, Aziz Ansari and Danny McBride. It was the latest in a much-too-long parade of R-rated comedies that Hollywood has rolled out this summer. Like last week’s The Change-Up, 30 Minutes was too little, too late and failed to bring out a large crowd. The Sony release played to young men – a crucial audience that has cut back on box office spending this year – as studio research showed that 58% of the crowd was male while 69% was under 25. A 7% Friday-to-Saturday dip and B CinemaScore indicate a rough road ahead.Once again, the sci-fi Western Cowboys &amp; Aliens lost more than half of its business grossing an estimated $7.6M for a 52% drop in the third frame and $81.5M to date. Fellow late summer action entry Captain America: The First Avenger held up better dropping 45% to an estimated $7.1M pushing the cume to $156.9M. Domestic finals should reach about $100M for Universal and $175M for Paramount. Captain America enjoyed a robust international weekend with another $12.2M from 45 territories for a $128.3M overseas tally to date and $285.2M worldwide. Cowboys had a more quiet international outing debuting in 14 markets including Russia and Korea with just $7M. Paramount is handling the releases for both overseas.The Steve Carell hit Crazy, Stupid, Love took in an estimated $6.9M, off 42%, for a $55.4M cume in 17 days. Warner Bros. should end with roughly $75M.The studio’s crown jewel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 remained in the top ten for a fifth weekend with an estimated $6.9M as well with a 45% decline. With a huge $357M to date, the 3D wizard pic remains at number 17 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters just ahead of the latest Transformers which now sits at $347.2M. By Monday, the latest Potter will overtake 1993’s Jurassic Park for the number 16 spot although the dinosmash had much lower ticket prices and no 3D or IMAX giving a boost. The final Voldemort pic is headed for about $375M before it leaves domestic theaters. The worldwide haul broke the $1.2 billion mark this weekend with another $30M overseas pushing the international cume to an eye-popping $857.8M and the global gross to $1.21 billion.After a disappointing opening frame, the Jason Bateman-Ryan Reynolds body switching comedy The Change-Up fell a disturbing 54% to an estimated $6.2M for a ten-day total of $25.8M. Look for a $40M final for Universal.Opening to dismal results and failing to break the top ten was Fox’s Glee Live! 3D, a music-filled documentary-style film featuring characters from the hit television show performing uplifting songs on stage. The PG-rated pic bowed to just $5.7M from 2,040 locations – all in 3D – for a weak $2,794 average. Receiving somewhat good reviews, Glee started slow on Friday with $2.7M and then collapsed by 37% on Saturday with a puny $1.7M. These young-skewing music pics based on popular brands are typically frontloaded, but Glee truly burned through much of its total audience on opening day Friday which accounted for 48% of the weekend gross. Overall excitement was not too high and the lack of a regular-priced 2D option prompted cash-strapped teens to skip the film. Luckily the production cost was only $10M. Glee joined the 80s comedy Take Me Home Tonight as the only films this year to debut in over 2,000 theaters and fail to break the top ten.The top ten films grossed an estimated $132.7M which was up 4% from last year when The Expendables opened in the top spot with $34.8M; and up 11% from 2009 when District 9 debuted at number one with $37.4M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Mary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Apes-Still-Rule-But-Help-Opens-Big"},{"id":"47508944875729","title":"1993’s Falling Down is an Eerie Reflection of Modern America’s Persecution Complex","content":"Sub-Cultvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})1993's Falling Down is an Eerie Reflection of Modern America's Persecution ComplexJoel Schumacher's controversial thriller starring Michael Douglas is as tone-deaf and histrionic now as it was at the time of its release.by Nathan Rabin | September 20, 2016 |  Comments&nbsp;Michael Douglas may be the most privileged man alive. His daddy Kirk was an incredibly rich, powerful, and famous movie star and producer, and he himself has graced the big screen in some of our biggest films for decades. Hell, even before Michael was a top box-office attraction, he won the Academy Award for producing One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest,&nbsp;a property his old man bought and gave to him the same way mortals might give their child a beat-up old car of theirs as a graduation present.Yet Douglas’ status as the cocky, smirking embodiment of white male privilege has somehow not kept him from repeatedly getting cast, or casting himself, as white men afflicted by the evils of non-white, non-men. In Fatal Attraction, his saintly, selfless adulterer is cruelly victimized by a mentally ill, sexually aggressive woman with some unfortunate ideas about rabbits. In Basic Instinct, meanwhile, his saintly, selfless horn dog is similarly terrorized by one of those insatiable wealthy bisexual serial killers who just won’t let straight men like him be.Evil, inscrutable Japanese gangs joined the list of groups terrorizing one of Douglas’ rugged protagonists in Ridley Scott’s blindingly slick, morally empty Black Rain, while Disclosure, based on the odious best-seller from an increasingly unreadable Michael Crichton, found him very plausibly being sexually harassed by a hot-blooded sexpot played by an ascendant Demi Moore.In that respect, Douglas’ unlikely role as the embodiment of impotent white rage in Joel Schumacher’s controversial 1993 drama Falling Down&nbsp;represents the simultaneous apex and nadir of the actor’s strange obsession with playing characters who feel hopelessly victimized despite belonging to a demographic that has historically wielded enormous, generally unchecked power.I was tempted to re-visit Schumacher’s sweaty, failed attempt at relevance because the film foreshadows and anticipates the deep, frightening strain of unhinged white male rage powering Donald Trump’s political assent. Trump has played unashamedly to his white male Christian base’s feelings&nbsp;of victimhood, to the sense that they are now the real persecuted class and that only a man like Trump will be able to stand up to the forces of common decency — I mean, political correctness — and finally restore the poor, embattled white man to a place of respect and dignity in our society.Seldom has the catalyst for a film protagonist’s rage felt so much like the kind of petty nonsense Andy Rooney devoted his entire useless career to dissecting.The film opens with Douglas’ laid-off former defense worker — who is never named, only referred to by his vanity license plate (“D-fens”) — marinating in a traffic jam Schumacher and cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak depict as the 10th&nbsp;circle of hell. Douglas’ alpha-male good looks are masked by his egregiously dorky attire: ugly, blocky glasses, a tight dress shirt, and a tie. His&nbsp;character begins the film on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and after an encounter with an Asian convenience store clerk goes awry, he decides to exact vengeance upon a world he is convinced hates him and everything that he stands for. D-Fens starts off wielding a baseball bat as his weapon of choice before picking up a proper arsenal from cartoonish toughs who, despite being decades younger than our star, are clearly no match for his rage-triggered super-strength. Our anti-hero then lashes out against everything from fast food restaurants that don’t serve breakfast past a certain time and con artists with unconvincing spiels to uppity construction workers and plastic surgeons who make too much money while men like the protagonist apparently make too little, or made too little before they became unemployable. Seldom has the catalyst for a film protagonist’s rage felt so much like the kind of petty nonsense Andy Rooney devoted his entire useless career to dissecting.Falling Down wants to be a 1990s update of Joe, a zeitgeist-capturing 1970 character study about a demented, hippie-hunting reactionary lunatic at war with the forces of social progress, which made Peter Boyle (who played the title character) a star. But Falling Down never comes close to realizing its ambitions, pretensions, and aspirations. It’s dodgy, disingenuous, deeply confused schlock that thinks it’s art, a scummy, simplistic potboiler that all but nominates itself for a dozen Academy Awards.The film was supposed to prove that, with the right script, star, and subject, Joel Schumacher, who more or less personified empty show-biz glitz even before he made Batman &amp; Robin, could make a film that was uncharacteristically serious, smart, and even important. Schumacher and his collaborators set out to make the kind of message movie that ends up on the cover of Time for saying something profound about The World We Live In Today.The performances here are so big and broad that they suggest that Schumacher’s primary direction to his actors was to gesticulate so wildly and yell so loudly that someone thousands of feet away would still know exactly what they were saying and doing. Douglas has a few nice moments when the deafening volume and comic book luridness of the film give way to something quieter and more reflective, but for the most part he’s embarrassingly hammy and over-the-top. With his nerdy glasses, sweat-soaked dress shirt, tie, and briefcase, he looks and acts less like an ordinary man driven to violent and insane extremes than a man wearing a “geek” Halloween costume.He looks and acts less like an ordinary man driven to violent and insane extremes than a man wearing a “geek” Halloween costume.The angry nerd’s crime spree brings him to the attention of cop Martin Prendergast (Robert Duvall), whose final day as a police officer becomes a whole lot more dramatic thanks to our anti-hero’s rampage. Prendergast is himself a groaning, lazy stock character: a cop on the verge of retirement who is getting too old for this s—. He&nbsp;also has a dead child and a wife who is mentally ill, both of whom are referenced constantly, the latter often in a way that underlines how D-Fens and Prendergrast may be on opposite sides of the law but are ultimately mirror images of each other. The anti-hero and the man who must bring him down share a strong but unspoken bond as old-fashioned men lost in a newfangled world full of minorities and women and arbitrary rules.Prendergast realizes that D-Fens is a precious and rare creature, a veritable unicorn: a white, middle-aged man in white, middle-aged man attire in the mean streets of Southern California, albeit one who looks like a Dilbert cosplayer lost in the wrong neighborhood. And because Falling Down&nbsp;is written by a white man, directed by a white man, and stars an icon of perpetually threatened whiteness, the only character we’re supposed to care about is the white dude scoring symbolic point after symbolic point over an endless series of broadly drawn straw men and women.&nbsp;Perhaps the most generous reading of the film&nbsp;is that it allows us to see life through D-Fens’ perspective, as an endless series of minor annoyances and inconveniences that collectively add up to an insult to his essential being.Instead of dissecting and deconstructing racism and white privilege, Falling Down&nbsp;ends up reinforcing them at every turn.&nbsp;The film&nbsp;is filled with sweaty, boorish caricatures of Latino gang-bangers; heavily-accented Asian store-keepers who seemingly take malicious delight in verbally abusing their customers; scary, desperate homeless people; and various other folks at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder to whom&nbsp;the film nevertheless feels duty-bound to deliver a few swift kicks.&nbsp;The film tries to undercut the offensiveness of depicting its&nbsp;supporting characters in this way by adopting a cast of blandly multi-cultural cops to trade generic banter with Prendergast, as if doing so&nbsp;excuses the film’s extensive reliance on racist stereotypes.We’re not necessarily asked to identify with D-Fens, or to root for him, yet the film keeps betraying its&nbsp;unearned respect for him. Throughout the film, cops interviewing witnesses of D-Fens’ rampage are repeatedly surprised and impressed by his ethics, by the way he would terrorize and threaten and point guns at innocent shopkeepers but not do anything unforgivable, like shoplifting. They are way too impressed to discover that their suspect is that most common of pop-culture archetypes, the vigilante with a strong moral code.D-Fens wants to return&nbsp;to an idyllic time that probably never existed.Just as folks like David Duke have given Trump a chance to delineate between his more subtle form of racism and xenophobic hatred and Duke’s more overt, less artful variety, Falling Down further lets its protagonist off the hook. Frederic Forrest shows up as a military store proprietor who gushes about the wonders of the gas chambers and the awesomeness of the Holocaust, just so that D-Fens can take a bold moral stand and say that, yes, while he may be racist and angry and entitled and psychotic, at least he’s not a neo-Nazi aching for the return of concentration camps. Forrest’s twitchy, bug-eyed, hollering performance suggests Herman Hermann, the one-armed Simpsons conspiracy nut who similarly runs an Army-Navy surplus store in Springfield, only more cartoonish and less multi-dimensional.&nbsp;To really drive home the point, D-Fens ultimately kills&nbsp;the white nationalist lunatic, but only after he artfully establishes their similarities by repeating to him, “We’re the same,” and D-Fens replies with an equally artful “We’re not the same.”At this point, the film stops being Nerdlinger’s Racist Revenge, as D-Fens swaps his geek costume for some vaguely paramilitary gear and his quest for vengeance enters a bleak endgame. The protagonist talks about going&nbsp;home; he means that he wants to get back to a place, emotionally and otherwise, where his ex-wife and daughter think of him as a loving husband, a good provider, and an involved father, not the violence-prone rage monster they have a restraining order against.On a literal level, D-Fens wants to return&nbsp;to his ex-wife and daughter’s home so he can give his daughter her birthday present. On a more metaphorical level, D-Fens wants to return&nbsp;to an idyllic time that probably never existed, when a white man with a college degree was promised an&nbsp;attractive&nbsp;wife and lifelong marriage, two beautiful children, and a big house they could afford. Oh, and women and minorities knew their place, humbly accepted subordinate roles, and meekly, slowly worked towards social progress, albeit in ways designed not to make the white establishment feel threatened or uncomfortable. That’s the fantasy Trump is talking about when he vows to “make America great again,” and in both Trump’s case and the case of sad, pathetic D-Fens, they’re clearly only concerned with making America a more comfortable, endlessly affirming place for white men like themselves.Watching Falling Down in 2016 is a curious experience in that it should speak powerfully and directly to a strange and intense cultural moment and a form of rage with the potential to change our country and world in terrifying ways. The film should comment incisively on our current political and social landscape. Instead, it feels just as wrong, over-the-top, and tone-deaf now as it did back when it was released. I re-watched the movie hoping that it might teach me something about the roots and nature of white anger. Instead, it only ended up feeling like a histrionic wish-fulfillment fantasy for Trump supporters.Original Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;73 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;RottenNathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

Other new releases were not so lucky as the Tom Hanks-Julia Roberts vehicle Larry Crowne and the Selena Gomez pic Monte Carlo both delivered disappointing results.Towering over all other films, the third Transformers installment debuted to an estimated $116.4M over the extended Friday-to-Monday holiday period and a colossal $181.1M since its launch on Tuesday night with 9pm previews. The Friday-to-Sunday portion was $97.5M. That was good enough to break the seven-year-old records for this holiday set in 2004 by the highly anticipated superhero sequel Spider-Man 2 which bowed to $88.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday span and $115.8M over the Friday-to-Monday period. Taking out the $5.5M that Optimus Prime brought in from Tuesday night sneaks, the actual Wednesday-to-Sunday tally for the robots was $156.7M. The Spidey pic sold more tickets though as Transformers enjoyed a big jump in 2D prices plus 3D surcharges.Paramount aggressively marketed Moon as a film that should be seen in 3D given that it actually delivers the thrills moviegoers expect from the format unlike so many converted action pics from earlier this year. The film and its campaign paid off as 3D screens accounted for 60% of the gross making for a higher share than the 45% figures that recent action films like Green Lantern and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides had. Moon also played in digital IMAX 3D locations.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244472[/rtimage]Dark of the Moon‘s daily run started with an official opening day Wednesday of $37.7M. Thursday dipped 43% to $21.5M, Friday surged 53% to $32.8M, Saturday inched up another 5% to $34.4M, and Sunday is estimated to dip 12% to $30.3M. The studio also reported a Fourth of July holiday Monday estimate of $18.9M, down 36% from Sunday. The third Shia LaBeouf-led actioner fared well with ticket buyers earning an encouraging A grade from CinemaScore. Good buzz from those that caught the film mid-week helped create recommendations that convinced a broader audience on the weekend to take a chance on the latest dose of destruction and mayhem.Moon launched ultrawide in 4,013 domestic locations and averaged a muscular $29,006 per theater over four days helped by 3D fees. It also ranked as the third best July opening (Friday-to-Sunday) ever trailing The Dark Knight ($158.4M) and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest ($135.6M) which both opened on a Friday.The 6.5-day total for the new Autobot flick will not beat the $200.1M five-day non-holiday launch of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen from June 2009, however it will certainly finish higher than the $155.4M 6.5-day debut for the first film in the series from this same holiday weekend in 2007. That pic started with 8pm preview shows on a Monday with Tuesday being the first full day of release. Factor in the changes in ticket prices and the 3D effect and the number of stubs sold were about the same for the first and third chapters. Good will from the first film helped the opening of the second, but bad buzz from that pic prompted some to drop out when the third pic arrived.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244474[/rtimage]As expected for a Michael Bay action sequel, reviews were not too upbeat. But critics were generally pleased with the quality of the 3D presentation with many saying it was the best for any action movie since Avatar. James Cameron’s 3D camera technology was used in the shooting of Dark of the Moon.The new Transformers opened day and date in most of the world this weekend and generated a sensational $379M opening from Wednesday to Sunday (including previews) making it the third biggest global opening ever after Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince ($394M) and Spider-Man 3 ($381.6M). Moon‘s international portion stood at $217M led by Korea’s $30M, Russia’s $22M, and the United Kingdom’s $16.5M. China and Japan open later in July and are expected to add much more to the run. Overseas audiences spent more on the extra dimension as 3D accounted for a higher 70% of the international grosses.The 3D animated sequel Cars 2 fell apart in its second weekend crumbling 60% over the Friday-to-Sunday period and collected an estimated $32.1M over the long holiday frame. It was the worst sophomore drop ever for a Pixar film. Sequels typically decline more than originals but the G-rated toon had a holiday to help the second weekend and the new releases did not provide too much direct competition for younger children. Fans of the franchise came out in solid numbers on the first weekend, but word-of-mouth does not seem strong enough to keep the film going. Second weekend falls for the Toy Story sequels were 52% for part two which came off of the Thanksgiving holiday and 46% for the third part from last summer. The 11-day total for Cars 2 sits at $123M and a rough road ahead could lead to a final take of around $190M putting it well below the $244.1M of the first Cars from 2006 which had cheaper 2D tickets and no 3D surcharges to help its numbers. Overseas, the Mater movie collected an estimated $22.1M from just 19 territories bumping the international cume to $82.2M led by Mexico, Russia, and Brazil with the global tally climbing to $205.2M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244299[/rtimage]After a stellar debut, the Cameron Diaz comedy Bad Teacher suffered a sizable fall dropping 54% (over the three-day span) to an estimated $17.6M giving Sony $63M after 11 days. The poorly-reviewed R-rated pic might be able to reach $100M for Sony if it can stabilize itself after the holiday weekend.The combined starpower of Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts meant little at the box office as their poorly-reviewed new film Larry Crowne generated a disappointing opening in fourth with only $15.7M, according to estimates, over four days. Universal’s PG-13 entry played in 2,973 locations averaging $5,295 per site and played to the oldest audience among the weekend’s major films. Studio data showed that a whopping 81% of the crowd fell into the extra old category of 35+ while females made up 64% of the audience. Budgeted at only $30M, Crowne was directed by Hanks but an overall dull look coupled with negative marks from critics trumped the star names. And a B CinemaScore grade does not indicate a great road ahead. Universal was quick to explain to the media that it only distributed the film and that Vendome Pictures fully financed the project. The Friday-to-Sunday portion was just $13.1M.Paramount’s no-star summer hit Super 8 followed with an estimated $9.5M over the long weekend upping the cume to $109.7M. Steven Spielberg has now produced or directed $100M+ grossers across five straight decades.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244300[/rtimage]The teen girl dramedy Monte Carlo opened in sixth place to soft results grossing an estimated $8.8M. Fox’s PG-13 film about a young woman pretending to be a princess while overseas averaged a mild $3,538 over four days from 2,473 locations and played mostly to young females attracted to star Selena Gomez. Reviews were generally negative.Making it into the century club, although in troubling fashion, was Green Lantern which collapsed again falling 64% (over the three-day span) to an estimated $8M giving Warner Bros. $103.7M in 18 days. The Hal Jordan flick looks to end the summer as the season’s lowest-grossing super hero film and may even struggle to reach $120M.The Jim Carrey kidpic Mr. Popper’s Penguins dropped to an estimated $6.9M putting the Fox release at $51.9M. Holding up well again despite losing 642 screens was Bridesmaids which grossed an estimated $4.4M boosting the total to $153.8M. Rounding out the top ten was the indie hit Midnight in Paris with an estimated $4.4M for a $34.5M cume for Sony Classics.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243797[/rtimage]New domestic totals for other summer films outside of the top ten include $248.8M for The Hangover Part II, $234.2M for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (which broke the $1 billion global mark on Saturday), $208.4M for Fast Five, $178M for Thor, $157.2M for Kung Fu Panda 2, and $139.4M for X-Men: First Class.The top ten films grossed an estimated $223.7M over four days which was off 6% from last year when The Twilight Saga: Eclipse opened in the top spot with $83.6M over the long holiday frame; and up 20% from 2009 when Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen remained at number one with $42.3M over three days in its second frame.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Legendary, disaster, Emmy, crime, Winter, series, franchise, NYCC, aliens, cults, scene, Annual, Academy, MSNBC, competition","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Transformers-Takes-Control"},{"id":"47509128775511","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Help Cleans Up Again","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Help Cleans Up AgainMeanwhile, Colombianaby Gitesh Pandya | August 29, 2011 |  CommentsThe North American box office slumped to its second lowest point of the year thanks to the lack of a breakout new hit plus a devastating hurricane wiping out plenty of business on the east coast. With tens of millions of people forced to stay home and many theaters shutting down for a day or two, moviegoing took a major hit across a large part of the country. But with films trying to pick up Saturday’s lost business on Sunday, and the weather event hitting at a time when the marketplace is generally weak anyway, the overall impact was not incredibly severe.Topping the chart for a second straight weekend was the sleeper hit The Help which slipped only 28% to an estimated $14.3M. After 19 days of release, the Disney release has collected a sturdy $96.6M and will break through the $100M mark this week. The Viola Davis starrer averaged $5,159 which was impressive for the third weekend of a non-tentpole film.The weak marketplace saw consumers spend just over $85M on the Top 20 films. Only the Super Bowl frame in early February was worse this year with $82M. Box office prospects over the next couple of weeks also look grim with few films hitting theaters that are truly exciting ticket buyers.The revenge thriller Colombiana led the new releases with an opening weekend score of $10.3M, according to estimates. The Sony release about an assassin hunting down her parents’ killers averaged $3,940 from 2,614 locations which was respectable for a late summer film with a hurricane eating into east coast business. Starring Zoe Saldana and produced by Luc Besson, Columbiana did not fare too well with critics, but did connect moderately well with adult women. Studio research showed that 57% of the audience for the PG-13 pic was female and 65% was 25 or older.The horror film Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark attracted a soft debut in third with an estimated $8.7M. Averaging a lackluster $3,148 per site from 2,760 theaters, the R-rated remake suffered from stiff competition being the third fright film in as many weeks to hit the multiplexes. FilmDistrict marketed the thriller as being from producer Guillermo del Toro who has a fan following of his own, but overall interest was not too strong.Fox’s sci-fi prequel Rise of the Planet of the Apes ranked fourth with an estimated $8.7M as well, down 46% in its fourth frame. The action hit now stands at $148.5M on its way to $170M+.The Paul Rudd comedy Our Idiot Brother debuted poorly in fifth place with an estimated $6.6M from 2,555 locations for a wimpy $2,578 average. The summer’s latest R-rated comedy earned decent reviews for The Weinstein Co. (which acquired the hot pic at this year’s Sundace Film Festival) but lacked the must-see buzz that so many other raunchy comedies earlier this summer had. Often times films work at more specialized events like Sundance or Comic Con, but fail to make much of a mark during a commercial release across 50 states.A pair of 3D kidpics followed. In its second weekend, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World fell 51% to an estimated $5.7M for The Weinstein Co. With $21.7M in ten days, the PG-rated fourquel should finish with around $35M making it the lowest-grossing installment by far. Faring much better with families, The Smurfs slipped only 39% to an estimated $4.8M giving Sony a hefty $126M to date. The Smurfette pic has been the dominant choice for kids in the second half of summer.The 3D remake Conan the Barbarian collapsed by 69% in its second weekend to an estimated $3.1M for a weak $16.6M sum in ten days. The big-budget actioner looks to end its weak run with only $20-23M. Fellow sophomore 80s redo Fright Night also fell sharply tumbling 61% to an estimated $3M for a dull $14.2M total. Look for the 3D Disney release to finish up with only $20M. Rounding out the top ten was the hit divorce comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love with an estimated $2.9M, off 39%, for a $69.5M cume. The Warner Bros. film may reach $80M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $68.1M which was down 22% from last year when Takers opened with $20.5M; and down 35% from 2009 when The Final Destination debuted on top with $27.4M.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"japanese, Certified, books, game, BET, TV, movie, documentary, The, universal, adventure, Bros., anime, cults","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Help-Cleans-Up-Again"},{"id":"47509130438506","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Rio Debuts On Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Rio Debuts On TopLeads Scream 4 at number 2.by Sujit Chawla | April 18, 2011 |  CommentsIn what was expected to be a close race, the animated birds of Rio trounced the 10-years-in-the-waiting horror sequel Scream 4 while holdovers were a mixed bag.Fox has another animated hit on its hands (along with a possible franchise) as Rio opened with $40M this weekend, according to estimates, from 3,826 theaters for a per screen average of $10,455. The opening was almost exactly on par with Hop which opened two weeks ago to $37.5M and a $10,490 average. With no built-in audience from a previous installment and a brand new concept, the opening for Rio was pretty good, although the 3D surcharges should have added a few more dollars. Hop was in 2D and opened on 250 less screens. Still, $40M is nothing to sneeze at and other than Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil, there are no other family films coming out until Kung Fu Panda 2 at the end of May, so Rio should see some good legs over the next few weeks.11 years after the last installment, the masked killer(s) of Scream 4 returned with a soft opening of $19.3M, according to estimates. Expectations ran high amongst fans of the original trilogy, but those expectations didn’t turn into dollars as its per screen average of $5,833 was barely higher than the film that came in ninth this week. It seems fans came out this weekend but not a lot of new fans were created which was a bit of a surprise since horror fans are usually dependable. The last horror film to come out was two weeks ago with Insidious which is holding on remarkably well, and may have actually pulled out a few customers from Scream 4. Insidious opened to $13.3M with a $5,551 average but has fallen by less than 30% each weekend since.After a 2-week reign on top, the birds of Rio pushed the Easter Bunny of Hop down into third with an estimated $11.2M, down 48% from last weekend bringing its cume to $82.6M. Obviously the entrance of a new animated family film hurt, but Hop is still on target to get to $110-115M overall. The true-life story of Soul Surfer landed in fourth this weekend, falling a slim 30% from last weekend to finish with $7.4M, according to estimates, bringing its total to $20M. A final gross in the area of $40M is possible. In its second weekend the young assassin Hanna rounded out the top five with an estimated $7.3M falling 41% and bringing its total gross to $23.3M. A final number of around $40M is likely.Warner’s remake of Arthur fell 43% this weekend into sixth place with an estimated $6.9M bringing its cume to $22.3M. Look for another final total in the $40M range. Seventh place belonged to the horror entry Insidious which had the best hold in the Top 10, dropping only 27% to $6.85M, according to estimates, and bringing its current total to $36M after three weeks. Based on its strong holds even with a major horror film opening this weekend, there is the outside chance that Insidious could eventually out gross Scream 4 which would have been unthinkable even three days ago. Another film with a strong hold ended in eighth place this weekend as Source Code fell a slim 27% to $6.3M, according to estimates, bringing its cume to $37M.Robert Redford’s latest directorial work The Conspirator opened in ninth this weekend with an estimated $3.9M from 707 screens for an average of $5,550. Rounding out the Top 10 was the Universal flop Your Highness which had the biggest drop in the Top 10, falling 58% to an estimated $3.9M for a 2-week total of only $15.9M. Look for a final tally in the $25M range and a quick trip on to DVD.The Top 10 grossed $113M this weekend which was up 4% from 2010 when Kick-Ass debuted at number one with $19.8M; and up 16% from 2009 when 17 Again opened at the top of the charts with $23.7MAuthor: Sujit Chawla, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Starz, live, Plus, comedies, Television","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Rio-Debuts-On-Top"},{"id":"47509128859489","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Green Lantern Opens #1 with $53M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Green Lantern Opens #1 with $53MModest green for DC Comics and Warner Bros.by Gitesh Pandya | June 20, 2011 |  CommentsThe super hero summer continued with the third comic book film of the season debuting at number one as Green Lantern shot to the top of the box office with a less-than-stellar opening weekend of $52.7M, according to studio estimates. The pricey Warner Bros. release averaged $13,806 from 3,816 theaters including ones offering the PG-13 film in 3D with extra surcharges. Although the amount of the weekend take would be welcomed by most films, Lantern carried a reported pricetag of about $200M plus was backed by one of the most expensive marketing campaigns of any summer movie so far.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244109[/rtimage]Directed by Martin Campbell (Goldeneye, Casino Royale), Green Lantern starred Ryan Reynolds as the title character and was panned by critics across the board. Moviegoers also were not impressed as the CinemaScore grade was only a B. Generally, a B+ or better indicates that a large segment enjoyed a film. Poor reviews and bad buzz led to instantly negative word-of-mouth which hurt ticket sales immediately.Opening day Friday delivered a solid $21.6M including $3.35M from Thursday night’s post-midnight shows. But Saturday fell a disturbing 22% to $16.8M and the studio is optimistically projecting a slim 15% Sunday decline to $14.3M helped in part by Father’s Day. This summer’s well-reviewed super hero films Thor and X-Men: First Class both fared better with audiences. Each dipped by only 8% on Saturday and scored a B+ CinemaScore. More students were out of school for Lantern’s opening day, but the Saturday fall was still very troubling.With bad reviews, an alarming Saturday decline, and a low audience score, it seems that Green Lantern will burn out quickly at the box office. Even 3D did not help too much as only 45% of the weekend gross came from those screens. That was a lower rate than Thor’s 60% and The Green Hornet’s 61% and more in line with the 46% of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. The Hal Jordan film played as expected to the demographic most familiar with the character – adult men. Males made up 64% of the crowd while 63% were over 25. Generating true excitement with teens and younger adults has been a consistent problem for all Hollywood studios this year.For the Friday-to-Sunday opening weekend, Green Lantern managed to fall behind the $55.1M of the recent X-Men reboot from just two weeks ago and was far from the $65.7M bow of Thor from the first weekend of May. Moviegoers may only have an appetite for so many comic book flicks and three big ones within seven weeks may have been too much. Lantern had arguably the biggest character among the three and certainly the most starpower with Blake Lively, Tim Robbins, and the voice of Geoffrey Rush all in the same package. Next month’s Captain America will face challenges of its own being another 3D introduction of a new big-screen hero.Warner Bros. was keen on developing Green Lantern as a franchise that could spawn lucrative sequels in the years ahead. Those hopes, however, were not crushed this weekend as super hero films are designed to be rebooted over time. Superman, Batman, and The Hulk all saw their movie franchises crash and burn, only to be resurrected later with new directors and lead actors.Overseas, Green Lantern debuted in a dozen or so markets – many small – and grossed a moderate $17M with about half of that coming from the U.K. and Russia. As a very American super hero character, it may not generate the types of numbers overseas that recent summer action tentpoles have.On the other end of the word-of-mouth spectrum, Super 8 posted a remarkable hold in its second weekend dipping only 40% to an estimated $21.3M. Paramount’s $50M production has collected a solid $72.8M in its first ten days and could be headed for the vicinity of $130M allowing it to possibly outgross Green Lantern at the end of the day at a fraction of the cost. The J.J. Abrams-directed action drama rolled into more of the international marketplace with debuts in 20 more territories for a weekend estimate of $12.5M from 29 total markets led by a number one opening in the increasingly crucial market of Russia. Super 8 is showing that a well-made summer action film with a moderate pricetag can go a long way, even without bells and whistles.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244108[/rtimage]Jim Carrey’s new family comedy Mr. Popper’s Penguins debuted in third place with a respectable bow grossing an estimated $18.2M. The PG-rated film averaged $5,451 from 3,339 locations and earned somewhat negative reviews from critics. Females made up 56% of the crowd while 58% was under 25. The Fox release about a man that inherits wacky penguins from his dad increased by a scant 2% from Friday to Saturday and will have Cars 2 from the Pixar juggernaut to compete with next weekend so the road ahead will not be an easy one. But with more children getting out of school for the summer each day this week, midweek sales could be solid.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244111[/rtimage]The ensemble super hero flick X-Men: First Class finished fourth with an estimated $11.5M falling 52% in its third round. Fox has gathered $119.9M in 17 days and is still aiming to end in the $145-150M range. The origin pic grossed an estimated $21.2M overseas this weekend boosting that tally to $163.2M and the global gross to $283.1M.Two big worldwide hits followed. The Hangover Part II fell 46% to an estimated $9.6M boosting the domestic cume to $232.7M for Warner Bros. The raunchy sequel collected an estimated $21.5M offshore for a muscular international total of $256M. The global gross now stands at $488.7M surpassing its predecessor to become the world’s top-grossing R-rated comedy ever. Paramount’s 3D toon Kung Fu Panda 2 grossed an estimated $8.7M, off 47%, giving the DreamWorks sequel $143.3M to date. Overseas, where the Jack Black film ranks number one this weekend, kicked in an additional $52.5M for an international take of $280M to date led by China’s exceptional $77M.Slipping by a small margin once again, Universal’s sleeper hit Bridesmaids dipped 26% to an estimated $7.5M lifting the sum to $136.8M. Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides followed with an estimated $6.2M, down 43%, for a $220.3M cume from North America. Overseas markets contributed an estimated $25.9M pushing the international take to a towering $731.9M. That makes the Johnny Depp sequel the fourth biggest overseas blockbuster in box office history trailing just Avatar, Titanic, and the final Lord of the Rings pic which it will surpass at the end of this week. With an eye-popping $952.2M globally, Tides will break the magic $1 billion mark before the end of this month.With only a slight expansion, Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris continued to hold up very well slipping a mere 10% to an estimated $5.2M giving Sony Classics $21.8M to date. It could very well double that amount by the end of its run. Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer fell apart in its second weekend tumbling 63% to an estimated $2.2M for a $11.2M total.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244110[/rtimage]In moderate release, the critically-panned teen romance The Art of Getting By stumbled in its debut opening to an estimated $700,000 from 610 theaters for a weak $1,148 average. Starring Freddie Highmore and Emma Roberts, the Fox Searchlight release didn’t win much acclaim from critics cutting into its potential with arthouse moviegoers. The Irish dancing documentary Jig was impressive in its limited debut grossing an estimated $65,000 from solo sites in five major markets for a solid $13,000 average. Reviews were mixed but generally positive.The top ten films grossed an estimated $143.2M which was down 24% from last year when Toy Story 3 opened in the top spot with $110.3M; but up 2% from 2009 when The Proposal with Ryan Reynolds opened at number one with $33.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Go, harry, Arts, trailers, Hallmark","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Green-Lantern-Opens-1-with-53M"},{"id":"47509130430311","title":"Thor Hammers The Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Thor Hammers The CompetitionFast Five and Jumping the Broom round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | May 9, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, the latest super hero from the Marvel vault made his debut on the silver screen as Thor soared to a number one opening in North America. The sequel Fast Five fell sharply but finished in second with a hefty take of its own as both films continued to fight it out across the global box office. Rival wedding comedies battled it out for third place with the black-led Jumping the Broom edging out the white-led Something Borrowed despite playing in 900 fewer theaters. But the overall marketplace could not match up to last year’s frame which saw a gargantuan bow from a bigger comic book avenger — Iron Man 2.Doubling its nearest competitor, the effects-driven super hero flick Thor bowed on top with an estimated $66M from 3,955 locations for a muscular $16,688 average. Presented in 3D and in IMAX, the PG-13 film directed by Kenneth Branagh earned rave reviews and delivered strong debuts around the world before landing in North America this weekend. Technically speaking, Thor generated the third best opening for a debuting Marvel franchise after 2002’s Spider-Man and 2008’s Iron Man which also launched on the first weekends of May. However, other films like 2000’s X-Men, 2003’s The Hulk, and 2005’s Fantastic Four all sold more tickets and at today’s prices would have opening weekend tallies better than Thor’s. None of those films benefited from IMAX or 3D price hikes either.Paramount’s Norse God flick starring Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Anthony Hopkins played to super hero fans as expected. 63% of the audience was male and 72% was over 25. 3D screens contributed 60% of the gross for the converted pic. The CinemaScore was a B+ meaning that critics loved the film, and regular moviegoers just liked it. Thor will return to screens next year on the first weekend of May alongside Iron Man, Captain America, and The Hulk when Marvel’s long-awaited The Avengers debuts through Disney.Overseas, Thor grossed an estimated $46M this weekend from 60 markets boosting the international total to $176M and the global haul to $242M. With a more European feel to its story and characters, the film should see a larger share of its worldwide tally come from overseas than most American super hero films.After a scorching debut last weekend that resulted in the year’s best opening, the action sequel Fast Five hit the brakes and decelerated by an understandable 62% but still collected an estimated $32.5M in its sophomore frame. The last three sequels in the series all dropped by 59-63% in the second weekend so the new installment is in line with how the franchise plays out. The Universal hit has banked a stellar $139.9M in ten days of domestic release and looks headed for $180-190M.Sony enjoyed a surprisingly strong debut for its wedding comedy Jumping the Broom which grossed an estimated $13.7M this weekend. The $6.6M-budgeted production was expected to reach a maximum of $10M so the performance was impressive as the average came in at a solid $6,732 from only 2,035 sites. The PG-13 film starring Angela Bassett enjoyed a sturdy 25% boost in sales on Saturday and the distributor is projecting a very optimistic Sunday gross on Mothers Day that would slide a mere 17% from Saturday. Final grosses could see a tighter race between third and fourth places. Broom played to a mature female African American audience with exit polls showing that 70% of the crowd was female and 64% was over 35. A very high 95% stated that the film was “excellent” or “very good” and the CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A so good word-of-mouth should spread.Something Borrowed, starring Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson, debuted to an estimated $13.2M putting it in fourth place although final grosses to be reported on Monday should see a closer race for the number three slot. The Warner Bros. title averaged a decent $4,530 from 2,904 theaters and played to a female audience not interested in super heroes and fast cars. Critics were brutal in their reviews and Saturday sales climbed only 2% so Borrowed will have to work hard during the weeks ahead.Fox followed with a pair of films. The 3D animated hit Rio grossed an estimated $8.2M, off 45%, for a cume to date of $114.9M after 24 days. The Reese Witherspoon-Robert Pattinson romance Water for Elephants dropped 40% to an estimated $5.6M taking in $41.6M to date.Madea’s Big Happy Family tumbled 60% in its third round to an estimated $3.9M while the high school flick Prom grabbed an estimated $2.4M, down 49%. Totals are $46.8M for Lionsgate and $7.8M for Disney.Sony’s Soul Surfer slipped only 38% to an estimated $2.1M for $36.7M overall while Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil fell a steep 54% to an estimated $1.9M giving The Weinstein Co. a dismal $6.7M in ten days.Summit’s Mel Gibson film The Beaver directed by and co-starring Jodie Foster was met with indifference from arthouse audiences debuting to just $104,000, according to estimates, from 22 theaters for a dull $4,727 average. Earning somewhat good reviews, the $21M production will expand on May 20 in North America although the limited bow suggests that the road ahead will be troublesome. Given Gibson’s very public personal problems over the last few years there are many that will not spend a dime on his movies and Beaver lacks any must-see buzz to make it an exception.The top ten films grossed an estimated $149.5M which was down 11% from last year when Iron Man 2 opened in the top spot with a colossal $128.1M; but up 8% from 2009 when Star Trek debuted at number one with $75.2M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Month, CW, biography, drama, reboot, A&E, york, new, Witch, Now, video, TBS, disaster, Films, prank","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20083538/Thor.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-thor-hammers-the-competition"},{"id":"47509132371836","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Megamind Holds On To The Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Megamind Holds On To The Top SpotUnstoppable and Due Date round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | November 15, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend Will Ferrell’s cartoon creation Megamind enjoyed supreme rule over the North American box office for a second consecutive frame as the DreamWorks Animation hit grossed an estimated $30.1M to retain the number one spot. Dropping only 35%, the PG-rated 3D flick held up very well with paying audiences almost matching the 33% sophomore dip witnessed by the company’s 2007 toon Bee Movie from this same weekend. That Jerry Seinfeld pic collected 57% of its $126.6M final in the first ten days. If Megamind follows the same November-December pattern, it should end up with over $150M domestically and certainly a ton more overseas. The blue villain also had a much smaller second weekend drop than Monsters vs. Aliens which fell 45% so the animation studio must be happy with the staying power.Fox raced into second place with its disaster thriller Unstoppable which bowed to an estimated $23.5M from 3,207 theaters for a strong $7,328 average. The PG-13 film starring Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, and Rosario Dawson was inspired by true events and tells of a team of train workers that races against the clock to stop a runaway train carrying toxic waste from crashing in a heavily populated city. Reviews were outstanding for the Tony Scott-directed actioner which really helped the film connect with adult audiences. Saturday sales climbed an encouraging 19%. Starpower from Washington also helped as the bankable star routinely sees his films open north of $20M. With strong reviews, little action competition in the weeks ahead, and the busy Thanksgiving holiday around the corner, Unstoppable should enjoy a durable run.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238421[/rtimage]The Robert Downey Jr. comedy Due Date took a 53% tumble in the second weekend thanks to shaky word-of-mouth and grossed an estimated $15.5M for Warner Bros. The R-rated road trip flick has amassed an impressive $59M in ten days and should end its journey with about $90M.Audiences weren’t too interested in alien invasions as the sci-fi actioner Skyline opened in fourth place with only $11.7M, according to estimates. The latest underperformer from Universal averaged a mild $3,822 from 2,880 sites. The studio declined to screen the PG-13 film for critics and when reviews finally ran when the film debuted they were brutal. The modest budget is estimated to be only $10M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238422[/rtimage]Faring worst among the weekend’s new releases was the workplace comedy Morning Glory starring Rachel McAdams, Harrison Ford, and Diane Keaton which debuted in fifth place with an estimated $9.6M. Paramount released the PG-13 film on Wednesday and collected slow mid-week numbers resulting in a weak $12.2M over five days. Averaging a disappointing $3,822 over three days from 2,518 venues, the story of a young woman tapped to produce the lowest-rated morning news show earned mixed reviews from critics and played to an older and more female crowd.Tyler Perry’s latest entry For Colored Girls suffered a troubling drop in its second frame falling 65% to an estimated $6.8M. Rated R, the ensemble pic based on a popular play has grossed $30.9M in the first ten days and should finish with $40-45M for Lionsgate. It was the worst second weekend drop of any movie from the busy filmmaker.Still holding up well in its fifth round was the spy film Red which slipped 41% to an estimated $5.1M giving Summit $79.8M to date. Making about as much money this fall, but with no pricey stars inflating the budget, was the supernatural hit ParanormalActivity 2. The Paramount release scared up an estimated $3.1M, off 57%, for a $82M cume.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237816[/rtimage]Extra-dimensional sequels rounded out the top ten. The torture flick Saw 3D fell 64% to an estimated $2.8M while the zany stunts pic Jackass 3D declined by 54% to an estimated $2.3M. Totals stand at $43.5M for Lionsgate and $114.7M for Paramount.Expanding in their second weekend of release were a pair of Oscar hopefuls. Danny Boyle’s mountain climber saga 127 Hours went from four to 22 locations in several top markets and grossed an estimated $453,000 for a potent $20,591 average for Fox Searchlight. Summit’s CIA thriller Fair Game expanded from 46 to 175 sites and captured an estimated $1.1M for a mediocre $6,166 average. Cumes stand at $826,000 and $2M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $110.1M which was down 11% from last year when 2012 opened in the top spot with $65.2M; and down 18% from 2008 when Quantum of Solace debuted at number one with $67.5M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Amazon, canceled","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Megamind-Holds-On-To-The-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509132360570","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Harry Potter Edges Out Tangled","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Harry Potter Edges Out TangledPlus, Burlesque, Love and Other Drugs, and Faster all crack the top 10.by Gitesh Pandya | November 29, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, the wizard sequel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 won a narrow victory and held onto the top spot at the North American box office over a busy Thanksgiving holiday frame with an estimated $50.3M in its second weekend of release. Tumbling an expected 60% from its debut, the Warner Bros. smash raised its ten-day domestic tally to an impressive $220.4M. Compared to the last installment to open on a November Friday – 2005’s Goblet of Fire – Hallows opened 22% better but after ten days the lead has been cut to just 10%. Goblet even grossed more on its second weekend when it took in $54.7M over the same turkey session for a 47% decline.Hallows still has a shot at breaking the $300M mark domestically, though it’s not likely to go much past that. Overseas, the new Potter grossed an estimated $113.2M boosting the international total to $389.2M and the global haul to a stellar $610M with South Korea still to come in mid-December.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238691[/rtimage]Disney showed some big muscles with its newest princess tale Tangled which debuted a hair behind in second with an estimated $49.1M and a potent $69M over the five-day span starting Wednesday. The PG-rated 3D animated film was always expected to have a strong showing in the number two spot but did much better than anticipated with a sizzling $13,628 average from 3,603 locations. 3D surcharges certainly helped. Tangled opened much better than the studio’s 2007 princess pic Enchanted which bowed to $34.4M and $49.1M in five days. Reviews were very positive and the road ahead does not have too much competition.Moviegoers looking for a more guy-oriented 3D toon chose former number one Megamind which slipped 20% to an estimated $12.9M. Paramount has grossed $130.5M to date with its third DreamWorks Animation title of the year.Sony’s musical Burlesque followed with a mild debut. The Christina Aguilera-Cher combo drew in an estimated $11.8M over the weekend and $17.2M across the five-day span. Playing in 3,037 sites, the PG-13 film averaged only $3,885 over the Friday-to-Sunday period and performed exactly like the studio’s 2005 turkey weekend musical Rent. That film bowed to $17.1M over the Wednesday-to-Sunday session. Reviews for Burlesque were terrible and the crowd was 69% female.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238692[/rtimage]Enjoying the smallest dip of any film in the top ten was Fox’s runaway train flick Unstoppable which eased just 10% to an estimated $11.8M. After 17 days, the Denzel Washington film has taken in a solid $60.7M.Coming in sixth was the Viagra comedy Love and Other Drugs which debuted to an estimated $9.9M over three days from 2,455 theaters. The Fox release averaged a so-so $4,012 and its five-day total was $14M. Starring Brokeback Mountain alums Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, the R-rated film played to adults and was met with lukewarm reviews.Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson suffered one of the worst openings of his career with the action pic Faster which debuted in seventh place with an estimated $8.7M from 2,454 locations for a mild $3,549 average. The CBS Films release played to an adult male crowd and grossed $12.2M over its five-day holiday debut which was even with the three-day launch of the actor’s animated dud Planet 51 from last November. Faster cost $24M to produce with CBS kicking in half the amount plus domestic marketing costs. But unlike other films in the marketplace right now, the R-rated film actually saw daily increases from Wednesday thru Saturday so audiences do seem to be liking it.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238693[/rtimage]The Warner Bros. comedy Due Date followed with an estimated $7.3M, off just 18%, for a $85M cume. Dropping 25% was the Russell Crowe pic The Next Three Days with an estimated $4.8M for Lionsgate upping the ten-day total to $14.6M. Morning Glory rounded out the top ten with an estimated $4M, down 23%, giving Paramount $26.5M to date.Debuting with spectacular results in platform release was the Oscar hopeful The King’s Speech which bowed to an estimated $350,000 from a mere four theaters for a scorching $87,500 average. The Weinstein Co. release starring Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush earned strong reviews and expands to more cities in the weeks ahead.The top ten films grossed an estimated $170.6M which was off just 1% from last year when The Twilight Saga: New Moon remained in the top spot with $42.9M; but up 12% from 2008 when Four Christmases debuted at number one with $31.1M.Written by Gitesh Pandya of Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"pirates, Spectrum, reboot, SDCC, Fox, sequels, natural, marvel, The, Hulu, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Harry-Potter-Edges-Out-Tangled"},{"id":"47509132361595","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Harry Potter Enjoys Monster Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Harry Potter Enjoys Monster OpeningMegamind and Unstoppable hold strong, and The Next Three Days debuts at #5.by Gitesh Pandya | November 22, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend wizard fans united and sent the much-hyped fantasy sequel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 soaring to the number one spot with a massive opening weekend of $125.1M, according to estimates, making it the highest-grossing debut ever in the seven-film series. Launching ultrawide in 4,125 theaters, including a record 239 IMAX locations, the dark PG-13 adventure averaged a sensational $30,332 per site and ranks as the sixth best opening weekend of all-time behind The Dark Knight ($158.4M), Spider-Man 3 ($151.1M), The Twilight Saga: New Moon ($142.8M), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest ($135.6M), and this year’s Iron Man 2 ($128.1M). IMAX accounted for 10% of the opening weekend tally with $12.4M with many upcoming shows already sold out.For the wizard franchise, it was the best debut of any kind. The highest Friday-to-Sunday opening before was $102.7M for 2005’s Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which launched on the same November Friday while the top gross for the first three days of release was $107M for the last installment, 2009’s Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which bowed on a Wednesday in the summer. Ticket price increases helped set a new franchise record as Hallows, Goblet, and 2001’s original Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone each sold roughly 16 million tickets on opening weekend. The fan base has remained relatively constant but moviegoers pay more for a stub with every film.Still, it was a monumental performance and ranks as the second best ever outside of the busy summer tentpole season behind just New Moon which attacked this very weekend last year. Deathly Hallows even performed the same way throughout the weekend with a 37% Friday-to-Saturday drop compared to Moon‘s 42%. Both franchises are based on wildly popular books with fans obsessed with coming out on the first day, especially for Thursday night post-midnight shows. The new Potter banked an incredible $24M for those showtimes.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238539[/rtimage]Looking at the daily journey, the first half of the two-part finale exploded on Friday with $61.2M including midnight shows, fell sharply to $38.2M on Saturday, and is estimated by Warner Bros. to slide by 33% to $25.8M on Sunday. The turnout was extremely front-loaded with the opening day tally accounting for a whopping 49% of the weekend haul. Similarly, New Moon‘s first day was 51% of the three-day figure and it tumbled by 70% on the second weekend despite it being the Thanksgiving holiday.Reviews were mostly positive for the new wizard tale and cast and crew made the usual rounds for their global publicity push including glitzy premieres on both sides of the Atlantic in London and New York. David Yates directed as he did for the last two installments and his final offering, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is set to open next summer on Friday, July 15, in 3D two weeks after the third Transformers pic and a week before Captain America: First Avenger both of which will also be in 3D. The studio had wanted to make Part 1 in 3D but was unable to complete the conversion in time to make a product good enough for the fans.Overseas, the latest installment was as gigantic as expected and grossed a colossal $205M from 54 countries and 91 markets resulting in a monstrous $330M global launch over the first weekend. The last film Prince bowed mid-week and debuted to $394M worldwide but over five days. Deathly Hallows set a new all-time opening weekend record in the U.K. with an estimated $28M haul. Other notable bows included $21.8M in Germany, $14.8M in Australia, $14M in Japan, $12.3M in Russia, $11.5M in Italy, $10.2M in Mexico, and $9M in China.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238540[/rtimage]The 3D animated film Megamind was booted from the top spot after two weeks at number one and finished the weekend in a distant second place. DreamWorks Animation’s latest hit held up reasonably well dropping 45% to an estimated $16.2M pushing the 17-day tally across the century mark to $109.5M. Paramount is still on a course to hit the $150M mark although Disney will unleash the rival 3D toon Tangled on Wednesday to give families another major option over the extended Thanksgiving holiday session.Fox enjoyed an encouraging second weekend take for the Denzel Washington actioner Unstoppable which dropped 42% to an estimated $13.1M. The runaway train pic has taken in a solid $42M in ten days and is headed for the $75M vicinity.Finishing in fourth place was the R-rated road trip comedy Due Date which declined by 41% to an estimated $9.2M. Warner Bros. has taken in $72.7M in 17 days and should end up in the $90-100M range depending on strength over the long Thanksgiving holiday.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238537[/rtimage]Audiences gave the cold shoulder once again to Russell Crowe whose latest film The Next Three Days flopped opening to an estimated $6.8M. The PG-13 film about a teacher who desperately tries to break his wife out of prison averaged a weak $2,633 from 2,564 locations giving Lionsgate its worst debut in almost two years. Elizabeth Banks co-starred and Liam Neeson contributed a one-scene cameo while Oscar winner Paul Haggis directed. Crowe’s last film – the expensive summer epic Robin Hood – barely inched its way over the $100M mark in North America and his recent adult dramas have mostly opened in the $13-14M range.Paramount’s TV industry comedy Morning Glory fell a moderate 43% in its second weekend grossing an estimated $5.2M to boost the ten-day total to a soft $19.9M. The Rachel McAdams film looks to end with $32-34M. Fellow sophomore Skyline completely fell apart thanks to poor buzz. The Universal release dropped 71% to an estimated $3.4M for a cume of $17.6M in ten days. With a reported production budget of $10M, plus plenty more for marketing, the alien flick could end with $21-23M. Summit’s action hit Red grossed an estimated $2.5M, off 50%, for a $83.6M total.Falling 63% to an estimated $2.4M was Lionsgate’s For Colored Girls… which has banked $34.5M to date. Jumping into the top ten for the first time was the CIA thriller Fair Game which expanded in its third frame from 175 to 386 theaters collecting an estimated $1.5M. The average for the Summit release was a mild $3,808 and the sum rose to $3.7M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238538[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $185.3M which was down 25% from last year when The Twilight Saga: New Moon opened in the top spot with $142.8M; but up 20% from 2008 when Twilight debuted at number one with $69.6M.Written by Gitesh Pandya of Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Pictures, Creative, Musical, zombies, christmas","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Harry-Potter-Enjoys-Monster-Opening"},{"id":"47509132349304","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tron Cycles To The Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tron Cycles To The TopYogi Bear, Narnia round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | December 20, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, moviegoers flocked to the North American box office as five new films entered wide release led by the sci-fi action sequel Tron Legacy which powered its way to number one by a wide margin. The kidpic Yogi Bear settled for a mediocre debut in second while the expensive star-driven romantic comedy How Do You Know flopped finishing in eighth place. Critically acclaimed awards hopefuls The Fighter and Black Swan — both nominated for multiple Golden Globes including Best Picture-Drama — expanded nationwide after successful play in limited release and scored solid numbers ahead of what should be lengthy runs. Despite the absence of Avatar which opened a year ago, overall ticket sales were almost equal to last year’s frame.Grossing more than the next three films combined, Disney’s heavily-promoted effects picture Tron Legacy debuted on top with an estimated $43.6M easily leading the pre-Christmas frame. The PG-rated film played in 3,451 theaters and averaged a sturdy $12,634 helped in part by higher ticket prices from 3D and IMAX screens. It was the fourth number one hit for the studio this year following Alice in Wonderland, Toy Story 3, and Tangled. All were 3D flicks.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239417[/rtimage]Following up on the 1982 original which went on to become a cult classic with sci-fi and video game fans, Legacy saw the return of Jeff Bridges and aimed to deliver dazzling visuals on the big screen for a broad audience. With a reported production budget of at least $150M and a pricey marketing push, the action film needed a solid debut before the holidays to get on the right track and it succeeded. Given that the property was never wildly popular by mainstream standards, a gigantic opening was not expected. Legacy was a guy flick with studio research showing that a very high 66% of the audience was male and 75% was over 18. Disney will now try to connect with women to broaden the audience. The CinemaScore was a decent B+ and reviews were mixed.Overseas, Tron Legacy grossed $23M from number one openings in 26 territories led by Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Spain for a worldwide bow of $66.6M. The global roll-out continues next weekend and into the new year.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239418[/rtimage]Opening in second place with a mild debut was the 3D family film Yogi Bear which took in an estimated $16.7M from 3,515 theaters for a $4,752 average. The debut was on par with the $16.1M bow Warner Bros. saw for its fall 3D toon Legend of the Guardians. Yogi is based on a better-known property, however with its mid-December launch, it should have better playability as the target audience becomes more available in the days ahead. These types of films launching at this time can often finish with four to six times their opening weekend tallies. Reviews were horrible.The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader fell by 48% to an estimated $12.4M in its second weekend. The decline was smaller than the sophomore drops of the first two films in the series, but was still sizable. After 10 days, the Fox release has collected $42.8M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239211[/rtimage]Close behind in fourth was the acclaimed boxing drama The Fighter which expanded nationwide to the tune of $12.2M, according to estimates. The Paramount release averaged a good $4,874 per site from 2,503 locations and is trying to set itself up for a long winter run boosted by the holidays and continued momentum during awards seasons. Nominated for six Golden Globes, the R-rated pic has fared well with both critics and paying audiences earning strong reviews and a solid A- CinemaScore. Studio research showed that the film skewed 53% female and played older with 87% being 25 or higher. Co-produced with Relativity Media for only $25M and starring Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Amy Adams, and Melissa Leo, The Fighter aims to remain a top ten contender for some time despite heavy competition for mature adults.Sony’s megastar combo The Tourist with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie followed its wimpy opening with a 47% drop to an estimated $8.7M. With $30.8M in 10 days, the big-budget spy flick is suffering from weak initial interest and bad word-of-mouth putting it in a difficult position heading into the holidays when its adult audience will start to get more free time.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239212[/rtimage]Tied for fifth place with an estimated $8.7M as well, Disney’s Tangled slipped only 40% bringing the 3D toon’s cume to $127.8M. The arrival of Yogi Bear had little impact on the Rapunzel pic and with no new animated films arriving until next year, the holiday season should lead to a healthy bounty. The princess has amassed $97.8M overseas to date from only 17 territories for a robust $225.6M global tally.Awards magnet Black Swan expanded nationwide from 90 to 959 locations and surged to an estimated $8.3M for a terrific $8,655 average. Thanks to four Golden Globe nominations and plenty of other kudos it received from various groups over the last week, the ballet thriller has remained hot as it entered the national stage. Fox Searchlight has grossed $15.7M to date with much more to come. This Wednesday, it expands again to over 1,400 locations. Swan probably stole away many adult women from the next movie on the chart.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239419[/rtimage]Audiences rejected the newest venture from veteran writer/director James L. Brooks How Do You Know which managed a measly $7.6M debut, according to estimates, for a lowly eighth place finish. Averaging a lackluster $3,061 from 2,483 theaters, the PG-13 film brought with it a poor title and bad reviews making it a tough sell to mature adults despite the starpower of Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Paul Rudd, and Jack Nicholson. Following last weekend’s Tourist, Sony is finding out the hard way that moviegoers won’t blindly show up for any big-budget movie with A-list stars. The movies have to be good too, especially at today’s ticket prices.The audience for Know was 60% female and 55% over 30 and the gross was even worse than the $8.8M of Brooks’ last film Spanglish from this same weekend in 2004. That Adam Sandler film played through the holidays to a multiple of five ending with just $42M. It will be hard for Know to top that putting the film in a dismal situation given its massive budget estimated to be more than $100M because of the high-priced talent. Comedies rarely cost this much unless there is a major special effects component. Overseas prospects are not bright either. The film barely generated any interest and with more acclaimed films in the marketplace for adults, most opted for awards contenders.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238691[/rtimage]Dropping 43% to an estimated $4.8M was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 which raised its total to $265.5M. That was enough for the latest wizard flick to join the Top 50 list of all-time domestic blockbusters at number 50 displacing Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets which grossed $262M in 2002. With another $24.3M overseas, the newest Potter vaulted its international total to $558.6M and its worldwide haul to $824.1M. Rounding out the top ten was the runaway train hit Unstoppable with an estimated $1.8M, down 51%, for a $77.3M cume.In limited release, The King’s Speech continued its slow and steady climb with an estimated $1.1M from 43 venues for a superb $25,000 average and $2.9M total. The Weinstein Co. expands on Saturday, Christmas Day, into more than 600 runs. The Colin Firth pic earned more Globe nods than any other film with seven including Best Picture-Drama. Elsewhere, Lionsgate scored an estimated $55,000 platform bow for the Nicole Kidman-starrer Rabbit Hole from five sites for a good $11,000 average.The top ten films grossed an estimated $124.8M which was off 1% from last year when Avatar opened in the top spot with $77M; but up a whopping 61% from 2008 when Yes Man opened at number one with $18.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"concert, TCA, Broadway, new","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Tron-Cycles-To-The-Top"},{"id":"47509134059396","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Flock to The Town","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Flock to The TownEasy A, Devil, and Alpha and Omega also crack top 5.by Gitesh Pandya | September 20, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, moviegoers listened to film critics as the acclaimed new releases The Town starring Ben Affleck and Easy A with Emma Stone debuted in the top two spots with strong ticket sales by appealing to older men and younger women, respectively. Meanwhile, the new Hollywood offerings with bad reviews – the horror pic Devil and the 3D animated film Alpha and Omega – struggled to find ticket buyers over what was a relatively active weekend for mid-September.Warner Bros. scored a well-needed hit with Ben Affleck’s bank robbery thriller The Town which powered ahead of expectations to open with an estimated $23.8M easily winning a crowded frame. The R-rated crime flick averaged a terrific $8,319 from 2,861 locations and played to an adult audience looking for a quality fall drama. Reviews were exceptionally good with many critics calling it a contender for one of the ten Best Picture Oscar nomination slots. Town also starred Jon Hamm of the red hot Emmy Award-winning series Mad Men, Jeremy Renner of the Academy Award-winning The Hurt Locker, and Blake Lively from the hit teen soap Gossip Girl.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237261[/rtimage]Affleck, who also directed, hasn’t occupied the number one spot in a lead role since February 2003 when his Daredevil scored a strong debut. He followed up that superhero flick with Gigli later in the year which became one of the most panned films of the decade. With a reasonably modest production budget of less than $35M, the Boston-set Town skewed towards older men with 75% of the audience being over 25 and 55% being male. Connecting with that demographic in the fall when NFL and college football are major distractions is not easy. Plenty of cash was spent on marketing with the acclaimed film playing at both the Venice and Toronto film festivals and a major premiere held at Fenway Park in Boston to help generate waves of publicity.With the exception of Inception, Warner Bros. had a lousy summer suffering through the likes of the comic book dud Jonah Hex and the subpar performance of the pricey comedy sequel Sex and the City 2. The Town gives the studio what could be a leggy fall performer given the strong reviews and older audience base. The studio’s Boston-set crime dramas The Departed and Mystic River – also released in the fall and loved critics – went on to finish with about five times their opening weekend takes before making additional coin from Oscar re-releases.Young women powered the high school comedy Easy A into a strong second place showing with an estimated $18.2M. Yet another hit from Sony’s Screen Gems unit following Takers and Resident Evil: Afterlife, the PG-13 film about a clean cut high school girl that profits from rumors of her sexual exploits averaged a healthy $6,373 from 2,856 theaters. Critics gave high marks to the Emma Stone vehicle which also starred Amanda Bynes, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. With a low production cost of only $8M, Easy A looks to become an easy moneymaker. Studio research showed that 67% of the audience was female and half was under 18.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237262[/rtimage]A slick marketing campaign exciting teenagers was key to the success. Stone had appeared in supporting roles in Superbad, The House Bunny, and Zombieland but had never anchored a film before. Her stock has certainly climbed. Sony is hoping that strong reviews and good word-of-mouth will help broaden the audience. But a slim 5% uptick on Saturday indicates the usual upfront teen turnout.The horror entry Devil, the first of M. Night Shyamalan’s three-picture pet project deal with Media Rights Capital, didn’t scare up much business opening in third place with only $12.6M, according to estimates. The PG-13 pic about a group of people trapped in an elevator with Satan averaged $4,480 from 2,809 locations for Universal which is distributing worldwide. The studio paid $27M for global rights and will try to reach a domestic gross of the same amount. Devil also opened in seven international territories including the U.K. but collected just $2.3M. The trim 80-minute supernatural thriller was not screened for the press in advance and earned a troubling C+ CinemaScore from paying audiences. It stands as yet another clunker for Universal over these past two years.The Night Chronicles project aims to capitalize on the Shyamalan name when selling to audiences, but after a string of creative disappointments from the filmmaker, many thriller fans may have been turned off. Production begins next year on the second film in the series Reincarnate which tells of a jury being haunted by supernatural forces when deciding the fate of an accused murderer.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237263[/rtimage]Following its top spot debut, Sony’s Resident Evil: Afterlife tumbled 62% to an estimated $10.1M in its sophomore round dropping down to fourth place. The fall for the 3D four-quel was identical to the drop suffered by 2004’s Resident Evil: Apocalypse which was released on the exact same date six years ago. After ten days, Afterlife has hauled in $44M and could be headed for a $60M domestic finish. Overseas, the latest Alice adventure rocketed to $103.2M for a global tally of $147M in ten days on a trajectory towards the $200M mark.Faring worst among the frame’s quartet of new titles was the 3D wolf toon Alpha and Omega which bowed to an estimated $9.2M from 2,625 locations for a weak $3,505 average. The PG-rated film follows a recent string of 3D films to underperform including Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore, Piranha 3D, and Step Up 3D. With so much cash already spent this year on higher-priced tickets for the format, consumers are being extra cautious and picky when it comes to the brands and titles they actually go out and see. This Friday, Warner Bros. tests the waters with Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole while new 3D installments of Jackass and Saw may fare better in October.Leftovers rounded out the top ten. The heist pic Takers grossed an estimated $3M, down 47%, pushing the cume to $52.3M for Sony. George Clooney’s The American dropped 51% to an estimated $2.8M in its third frame giving Focus $32.9M to date.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237264[/rtimage]Christopher Nolan’s Inception became only the second 2010 movie to spend ten weekends in the top ten. The Warner Bros. smash eased just 28% to an estimated $2M for a $285.2M cume. Only the 3D toon How to Train Your Dragon has spent the same amount of time in the top ten this year. Avatar spent 12 weekends on the list this calendar year, but was a 2009 release. The Will Ferrell action-comedy The Other Guys also took in an estimated $2M, off 40%, lifting Sony’s total to $115.4M.Two films that are polar opposites tied for tenth place with estimates of $1.7M a piece. Sony’s Eat Pray Love dropped 42% for $77.7M to date. The revenge actioner Machete fell 60% and has taken in $24.3M for Fox.In limited release, Fox Searchlight enjoyed a solid platform bow for its British drama Never Let Me Go which grossed an estimated $121,000 from just four locations in New York and Los Angeles for a potent $30,208 average. With $165,000 since its Wednesday bow, the R-rated sci-fi romance will expand to major markets in the weeks ahead. Universal debuted the Sundance reality thriller Catfish in a dozen sites and opened with an estimated $255,000 for an impressive $21,250 average. It opens in 19 more markets next weekend and reviews were generally good. Philip Seymour Hoffman’s directorial debut Jack Goes Boating fared worse opening to an estimated $30,000 from four playdates for a mild $7,500 average for Overture.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237265[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $85.4M which was up 3% from last year when Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs opened in the top spot with $30.3M; and up 17% from 2008 when Lakeview Terrace debuted at number one with $15M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Spring, FX","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Audiences-Flock-to-The-Town"},{"id":"47509134065544","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Stallone Proves He Isn’t Expendable","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Stallone Proves He Isn't ExpendablePlus, audiences Love Julia and Scott Pilgrim loses a life.by Gitesh Pandya | August 16, 2010 |  CommentsIn a battle of the sexes, Sylvester Stallone’s testosterone-filled action flick The Expendables opened impressively at number one beating out the Julia Roberts globe-trotting drama Eat Pray Love which enjoyed a solid debut of its own in the number two spot. The teen offering Scott Pilgrim vs. The World flopped landing in fifth place in its first weekend of release while the overall marketplace was up versus last year despite being the first frame since October to not have any 3D movies in the Top Five.Stallone became the first movie star to anchor number one openings in each of the past five decades thanks to The Expendables which bowed on top with an estimated $35M. The R-rated ultra-violent kill-a-thon averaged a muscular $10,714 from 3,270 theaters and drew in business by gathering together a massive number of action stars under one roof. Along with actor-director Stallone were Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Steve Austin, Mickey Rourke, and Eric Roberts. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis also donated tiny cameo appearances and were heavily utilized in the marketing campaign which misled some.[rtimage]siteImageId=10236494[/rtimage]But the opening was a strong one and ranked as the second best in company history for Lionsgate behind just Madea Goes to Jail which debuted to $41M last year. Adult men, not surprisingly, made up the main audience with 61% of the crowd being male and 60% being over 25. The Expendables reportedly cost roughly $70M to produce and is expected to take in solid numbers overseas.Julia Roberts anchored her first solo starring vehicle in many years and enjoyed a solid debut in second place with an estimated $23.7M for her new soul-searching drama EEat Pray Love. The Sony release, an adaptation of the best-selling book, averaged a sturdy $7,690 from 3,082 locations and beat out the studio’s female offering from last August – Meryl Streep’s Julie &amp; Julia – which debuted to $20M on its way to $94.1M. Pray may not have the same legs though given its B CinemaScore grade, 4% Friday-to-Saturday dip, and weak reviews from critics. Julie scored a potent A CinemaScore, surged 17% on Saturday, and was well-liked by reviewers, even earning Streep a Best Actress Oscar nomination.[rtimage]siteImageId=10236496[/rtimage]Still, Eat held its own against the heavy artillery from Stallone and company. Studio research indicated that the audience was mostly older women with 72% being female and 56% being over 35. Produced for nearly $60M, the Julia Roberts vehicle drew in fans of the book as well as women pulled in by the lead’s starpower. Supporting turns by Javier Bardem and James Franco added a bit too.Sony claimed the number three spot as well with last weekend’s big winner The Other Guys which dropped 49% to an estimated $18M. The Will Ferrell-Mark Wahlberg action-comedy has banked $70.5M in ten days and looks headed for a $110-120M finish. Spending its fifth weekend in the top five, Christopher Nolan’s Inception dropped 39% to an estimated $11.4M putting the cume close to the quarter-billion mark at $248.6M. On Monday, the Warner Bros. smash will break $250M after 32 days of release.Universal was hoping to score a hit with teens and the comic book crowd with its Michael Cera pic Scott Pilgrim vs. The World but instead was met with disappointing results with an estimated $10.5M debut. The PG-13 pic based on the graphic novel series averaged just $3,735 from 2,818 locations and failed to appeal to moviegoers outside of those familiar with the source material. Scott performed a bit below Cera’s 2008 film Nick &amp; Norah’s Infinite Playlist which debuted to $11.3M and a $4,672 average showing that the young actor still hasn’t reached a point where he can open a picture on his own.[rtimage]siteImageId=10236495[/rtimage]With another slim decline of only 27%, Universal’s hit 3D toon Despicable Me grossed an estimated $6.8M upping the solid tally to $222M. After posting the lowest opening weekend of the franchise, Step Up 3-D suffered the highest sophomore drop tumbling 58% to an estimated $6.6M for a ten-day take of $29.6M. The first two installments of the dance series witnessed declines of 51% and 49% in the second frame. Despite higher 3D ticket prices, this Buena Vista pic should end up with roughly $45M which would be a new low for the franchise too.Angelina Jolie’s Salt placed eighth with an estimated $6.4M, off 42%, giving Sony $103.6M to date and its third summer release in the century club. Paramount’s comedy Dinner For Schmucks followed with an estimated $6.3M, down 39%, for a decent $58.8M sum. The Cats &amp; Dogs sequel fell 41% to an estimated $4.1M for a $35.1M total for Warner Bros.The top ten films grossed an estimated $128.8M which was up 8% from last year when District 9 opened in the top spot with $37.4M; and up 21% from 2008 when Tropic Thunder stayed at number one with $25.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"dceu, Family, japanese, on, Nominations, Studios, in","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Stallone-Proves-He-Isnt-Expendable"},{"id":"47509132396416","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Jackass Sets October Record","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Jackass Sets October RecordPlus, Red debuts at #2, and The Social Network holds on at #3.by Sujit Chawla | October 18, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend proved once again that film audiences enjoy the lowest common denominator, as Jackass 3D destroyed the rest of the box office this weekend, setting a new record for the month of October, while fellow newcomer Red also posted a positive result.Four years after the last installment of the men behaving badly series, Jackass 3D used the awesome power of 3D (and 3D ticket prices) to jump start the box office with a massive $50M debut, according to estimates. If these estimates hold, the film will be the new king of October opening weekends, dethroning the reigning champ of the last seven years, fellow threequel Scary Movie 3 which opened in October of 2003 with $48.1M. The movie opened with $22M on Friday (setting the single-day October record), fell 23% to $16.9M on Saturday and dropped 34% to $11M on Sunday. Apparently the quick death of 3D has been postponed as audiences filled the theaters and had no problem paying the extra surcharges to watch the demented Johnny Knoxville and company reach deep into their bag of tricks. In one weekend Jackass 3D is near the totals of the past two films, which made $64.3M and $72.8M in 2002 and 2006.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237816[/rtimage]Landing solidly into second place was the elderly spy flick Red which shot up an estimated $22.5M this weekend from 3,255 theaters for a per screen average of $6,912. Reviews for the Summit film, which stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren have been mostly positive.Continuing its strong run, Sony’s tale of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, The Social Network fell a slim 29% this weekend to $11M, according to estimates, bringing its cume to $63.1M. The film should easily join the century club, and with a slew of awards coming, probably fly higher. Following in fourth was the horse drama from Disney, Secretariat, which had the best hold in the top 10, sliding only 25% to an estimated $9.5M. Its cume is $27.5M and could find its way to a decent, if not spectacular, finish of around $65M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237817[/rtimage]Warner Brothers took up the next three spots at the box office with three completely different films. Last week’s runner-up, the romantic comedy Life as We Know It dropped 36% from last weekend to $9.2M, according to estimates. Its total now stands at $28.8M on its way to a final cume of around $55M. In sixth place was the kid-friendly owls of Legend of the Guardians which continues to post small declines week to week, falling 38% to an estimated $4.2M. Its cume is $46M. Ben Affleck’s The Town slid 37% into seventh place with an estimated $4M, bringing its total to $80M.Suffering the worst fall in the top 10 was Universal’s horror entry My Soul to Take which dropped 54% to $3.2M, according to estimates, bringing its cume to a paltry $11.9M. Look for a final total of around $18-20M and quick trip to the rental market. Ninth place belonged to Emma Stone (soon to be seen in the Spider-Man reboot) as her comedy Easy A rounded up $2.6M, according to estimates, a fall of 38% from last weekend. Its cume now stands at $52.3M. And rounding out the top 10 was Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps which fell 49% to an estimated $2.3M in its fourth weekend, bringing its total to $47.8M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237818[/rtimage]In liimted release, two high profile titles opened to strong and slightly-less strong results. Clint Eastwood’s latest directorial effort Hereafter grossed an estimated $231,000 from only 6 screens for a per screen average of $38,500. Doubling up on screens but taking in half the gross was the Hilary Swank starrer Conviction which made an estimated $110,000 from 11 screens.By Sujit Chawla of Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"indiana, Annual, globes, Fall, Trivia, drama, Certified, jurassic, Awards, Showtime, CW, book, aliens, new","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Jackass-Sets-October-Record"},{"id":"47509135697817","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dragon Soars Back To The Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dragon Soars Back To The TopKick-Ass and Date Night round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | April 19, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, it was another close race at the North American box office which saw the four-week old 3D toon How To Train Your Dragon edge out the new super hero saga Kick-Ass for the number one spot thanks to its incredible staying power. The frame’s other new release, the comedy remake Death at a Funeral, performed well with a solid debut in fourth place. Sophomore comedy hit Date Night posted strong legs in third place while most holdovers did well overall.Snatching the box office crown for the second time in its four-week run, the DreamWorks smash How To Train Your Dragon dipped only 20% to an estimated $20M propelling its cume to a stellar $158.6M after only 24 days of release. Audiences are loving Paramount’s PG-rated animated film and recommending it to friends making it a leggy blockbuster that could reach $225M or more from North America alone. 3D films have led the box office for seven consecutive weeks now and have ruled over 14 of the last 18 weekends.[rtimage]MapID=1194522&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=25&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Opening close behind in second place was the super hero flick Kick-Ass with an estimated $19.8M from 3,065 theaters for a good $6,444 average. Many expected the violent R-rated actioner to capture the top spot with ease thanks to a wave of internet and fanboy buzz stoked by the film’s strategic promotional plan which included a preview at Comic-Con last summer and a full opening night screening at South by Southwest last month. Reviews were mostly positive too and the film’s 11-year-old heroine, a cursing and killing machine with lethal machine gun skills, excited the core audience just as much as she angered parental groups.Kick-Ass delivered an opening that was certainly good, but not amazing, putting into question whether pre-release expectations were logical to begin with. Looking back at violent R-rated films opening in April, 2004’s Kill Bill Vol. 2 bowed to $25.1M while the following year’s Sin City debuted to $29.1M. Was it fair to think that Kick-Ass could draw in as much business?[rtimage]MapID=1217700&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Grosses may have taken a hit thanks to Carmike theaters not playing any Lionsgate releases currently. However, the distributor had no problem booking playdates nationwide as Kick-Ass enjoyed the fourth widest opening in company history. Lionsgate rarely launches films in more than 3,000 locations. Its only wider bows include Saw IV, Saw III, and The Forbidden Kingdom which all debuted in 3,150-3,200 theaters.For this weekend, the super hero pic debuted to $7.7M on Friday (including the first shows that began at 10pm on Thursday night) and dipped 5% to $7.3M on Saturday. The distributor is projecting an aggressive $4.9M for Sunday which would amount to a decline of just 33% from Saturday. Final grosses to be released on Monday could be lower. Kick-Ass cost $50M to produce with Lionsgate acquiring domestic rights for $15-20M plus paying for marketing.[rtimage]MapID=1226635&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Those not interested in cartoon Vikings or school-age crusaders spent their money seeing Date Night which enjoyed a remarkable hold in its second weekend. The Steve Carell-Tina Fey comedy declined by only 31% to an estimated $17.3M and boosted its ten-day total to a solid $49.2M. Reaching $100M is a definite possibility for the $55M-budgeted film. Good word-of-mouth and a lack of direct competition are both helping to fuel sales.Opening in fourth place was the Chris Rock-Martin Lawrence comedy Death at a Funeral which took in an estimated $17M from 2,459 theaters for a solid $6,913 average — the best in the top ten. The R-rated film, a remake of a British pic from just three years ago, tells of hi-jinks that result after the death of the patriarch of a family. Tracy Morgan, Danny Glover, Zoe Saldana, and AT&amp;T pitchman Luke Wilson also star. Reviews were generally weak. Studio research showed that 56% of the audience was female and 56% was 25 or older.[rtimage]MapID=10012010&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Falling from first to fifth place was two-time champ Clash of the Titans which grossed an estimated $15.8M, down a respectable 41% in its third lap. Warner Bros. has banked $133M in 17 days and is headed for $160-170M. Overseas ticket buyers spent an estimated $53.6M on Perseus and pals boosting the international take to $188.7M and the worldwide haul to $321.7M. The global gross could skyrocket to $600M by the end of the run making the studio happy about its last-minute upgrade from 2D to 3D.Miley Cyrus saw her latest project The Last Song dip by 41% to an estimated $5.8M for a cume to date of $50M giving the teen queen and Disney three straight hits breaking the half-century mark. Also surpassing $50M, but for the sixth time, was Tyler Perry who took in an estimated $4.2M with Why Did I Get Married Too?, off 62%, for a $54.9M total.[rtimage]MapID=1210444&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Two films tied for eighth place with estimates of $3.5M each. MGM’s comedy Hot Tub Time Machine dropped just 35% upping the tally to $42.5M. Disney’s Alice in Wonderland slipped by a similar 33% but has amassed $324M to date putting it at number 21 on the all-time domestic blockbusters list ahead of Shrek the Third‘s $321M from 2007.Rounding out the top ten was the action-comedy The Bounty Hunter with an estimated $3.2M in its fifth round, down 24%, for a $60.4M sum for Sony.The top ten films grossed an estimated $110.1M which was up 13% from last year 17 Again opened in the top spot with $23.7M; and up 38% from 2008 when The Forbidden Kingdom debuted at number one with $21.4M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Pet, TCA, history, Mudbound, National","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Dragon-Soars-Back-To-The-Top"},{"id":"47509135686547","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Shrek Keeps the Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Shrek Keeps the Top SpotSex and the City and Prince of Persia take #2 and #3.by Gitesh Pandya | June 1, 2010 |  CommentsWith both of the big new Memorial Day weekend openers debuting to disappointing results, the 3D animated sequel Shrek Forever After remained at number one for a second straight weekend thanks to only a moderate decline. After claiming the top spot on Thursday and Friday, the much-hyped comedy sequel Sex and the City 2 settled for second place for the weekend while the big-budget adventure pic Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time finished third. If estimates hold, the Friday-to-Sunday period will slump to the worst showing for Memorial Day weekend in nine years despite theaters charging record-high prices for tickets. Audiences sent a strong message to Hollywood studios – if you keep releasing subpar films and charge us more and more for them, we’ll get our entertainment elsewhere.The DreamWorks Animation toon Shrek Forever After held onto the box office crown by grossing an estimated $43.3M this weekend over three days dropping a respectable 39% from its opening. After ten days, Paramount has taken in $133.1M – boosted in part by 3D surcharges – and could be headed for a final tally of $230-240M. That would make it the lowest-grossing installment of the ogre series despite the extra high 3D and IMAX ticket prices. 2001’s Shrek grossed $267.7M, 2004’s Shrek 2 took in a mammoth $436.7M, and the 2007 pic Shrek the Third banked $322.7M. All four films were released on the weekend before the Memorial Day holiday session. Third fell by a larger 56% to $53M over the Friday-to-Sunday span in its second frame so Forever is holding up better.[rtimage]MapID=1194517&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Expected to be the queens of the holiday box office, the ladies of Sex and the City 2 instead managed just a second place debut taking in an estimated $32.1M over the Friday-to-Sunday span. Warner Bros. opened the R-rated sequel in 3,445 theaters and averaged $9,325 per site which nearly matched the $9,926 average of Shrek which is playing in 922 more locations. Bad word-of-mouth quickly affected the Sarah Jessica Parker franchise flick. Opening day on Thursday fetched $14.2M and sales have fallen every day since. Saturday suffered a disturbing 23% fall from the previous day which was truly disastrous since Friday was not helped by the opening day rush and Saturday was a day off for the audience of adult women.Since its Thursday bow, SATC2 has grossed $46.3M and its five-day launch from Thursday to Monday should reach roughly $52M. That means the sequel will gross less in its five-day holiday opening than its 2008 predecessor made in its three-day non-holiday bow. The first Sex debuted to $56.8M on the weekend after Memorial Day and was generally liked by fans who were expected to show up in larger numbers for the new installment. Reviews were horrendous, but franchise films like these usually can still score big bucks from loyal fans. With the road ahead expected to include large declines, City 2 is not likely to come close to the $152.6M of the first film.[rtimage]MapID=1226673&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=30&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The overseas launch was good but not amazing. SATC2 took in $27.6M from 17 markets including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Brazil. The first Sex opened better with $37.2M from 13 markets, although the dollar was weaker back then.Opening in third with disappointing results was the expensive action adventure Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time which collected an estimated $30.2M in its first weekend of play. Based on the popular video game, the PG-13 pic averaged $8,275 per theater from 3,646 locations and represented one of superproducer Jerry Bruckheimer’s worst openings for an action film in recent years. Marketing the historical adventure tale as being from the producer of Pirates of the Caribbean didn’t seem to fool too many moviegoers into buying a ticket. Reviews were mixed.[rtimage]MapID=1205710&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Persia never really sparked much interest among audiences despite a prolonged marketing push aimed at launching a new franchise. With reports putting the production cost in the range of $150M to $200M, a lot was at stake to get this film to sell tickets. Jake Gyllenhaal anchored the pic playing a rogue prince out to prevent a magical dagger from falling into the wrong hands. It wasn’t his first time starring in an effects-driven action tentpole launching over the Memorial Day session. In 2004, he co-starred in The Day After Tomorrow which exceeded expectations with a $85.8M four-day debut on its way to a massive $629M score worldwide. Persia opened overseas a week earlier and has seen decent but not spectacular numbers with $59M overseas this weekend from 45 markets for a $87.5M international total and $117.7M global cume.Iron Man 2, the summer’s biggest hit and the year’s largest 2D grosser, followed in fourth place with an estimated $16M in its fourth weekend. Paramount’s super hero release dropped 39% boosting the 24-day total to $274.6M putting the comic sequel at number 45 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters just behind the $277.3M of last summer’s The Hangover. Iron Man 2 still looks to be on a trajectory to finish close to or just a bit behind the $318.4M of its 2008 predecessor.[rtimage]MapID=1197264&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Universal’s pricey Robin Hood saw more audience erosion falling 45% to an estimated $10.3M which put the Crowe-Scott collaboration at $83M after 17 days of release in North America. Moviegoers overseas have given the historical epic similar treatment. The international markets brought in an estimated $17.6M from 56 territories, down 41% from last weekend, for a $154.6M total and $237.6M global tally. Worldwide ticket sales should finish in the $300-350M range. After exhibitors take their share, it won’t be enough to cover the massive production and marketing costs. If that wasn’t bad enough, the film won’t even come close to the $165.5M of Kevin Costner’s Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves from the summer of 1991 when the average ticket price was just above $4.The teen drama Letters to Juliet is holding up well with female audiences grossing an estimated $5.9M this weekend, off just 35%. Summit has collected $36.6M to date. Fox Searchlight’s comedy Just Wright followed with an estimated $2.2M, down 49%, for a $18.2M cume. The hit comedy Date Night spent yet another weekend in the top ten with an estimated $1.8M in its eighth lap, down 40%, bringing Fox’s total to date to $93.4M.[rtimage]MapID=1212890&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After bombing on opening weekend, MacGruber tumbled by 64% in the second frame to an estimated $1.5M for a dismal ten-day score of only $7.1M. Look for a final gross of around $9M making it one of the worst performances in history for a film playing in more than 2,500 theaters joining recent favorites like Lucky You, Hoot, and The Rocker. Paramount’s third film in the top ten finished in the ten spot. The 3D toon How to Train Your Dragon dropped 46% to an estimated $1M raising the sum to $212.6M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $144.3M which was down 14% from last year’s Memorial Day holiday which fell a week earlier on the calendar when Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian opened in the top spot with $54.2M in three days; and down 13% from 2008’s holiday when Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull debuted at number one with $100.1M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Dates, America, New, prank, Britbox, christmas, zombie, Comedy, blockbuster, Plus, Bravo","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Shrek-Keeps-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509135689621","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Iron Man 2 Tops Robin Hood","content":"\n\n                                            Weekend Box Office\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Box Office Guru Wrapup: Iron Man 2 Tops Robin Hood\n                        Letters to Juliet rounds out the top three.\n                        by Sujit Chawla | May 17, 2010                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                In a battle of dueling heroes, the man in the suit of iron defeated the English archer as Iron Man 2 held on in its second frame to take down Russell Crowe’s Robin Hood, although Robin Hood did open at #1 internationally this weekend.\nFalling 58.6% from its blockbuster opening, Paramount’s Iron Man 2 collected an estimated $53M this weekend, bringing its cume to $212.1M. The second weekend was only $2M ahead of the original Iron Man which fell 48% from its opening weekend to $51.2M. Sequels are generally front-loaded so this second weekend fall was expected. With strong mid-week grosses, the weekend drops should start to level out over the next few weeks. After its first two weeks, Iron Man had grossed $177.8M on its way to a final total of $318.4M. If Iron Man 2 plays out in the same manner, it could end up with a final gross in the $350M range, which, while spectacular, would still be on the low end of pre-summer expectations.\n[rtimage]MapID=1197264&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=97&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nOpening in second place with an estimated $37.1M was Robin Hood, the latest collaboration from Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott. This origin story of the famed ‘steal from the rich, give to the poor’ folk hero had a per screen average of $10,595 which was a little less than the Oscar-winning Gladiator had a little over 10 years ago. That movie opened with a nearly identical $34.8M on its way to a final gross $187.7M, and of course a bunch of Academy Awards. Don’t expect Robin Hood to fare the same, at least in North America. Exit polls had the audience at 56% male and 63% at 30 years or older, with a CinemaScore grade of only a B-, meaning there will be rocky roads ahead. Internationally however, it was a different story as Robin Hood opened with $74M from 56 territories, making it the second biggest international opening for distributor Universal, behind only King Kong. That puts the total global opening at $111.1M. And just for the sake of fun, Kevin Costner’s Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves opened in the summer of 1991 to $25.6M and a per screen average of $10,817 on its way to a $165.5M total. It could be a little embarassing to Crowe/Scott if their Robin Hood can’t hit the same heights as Kevin Costner did nearly 20 years ago.\nAlso debuting this weekend was the romance Letters to Juliet which grossed an estimated $13.75M from 2,968 theaters, for a per screen average of $4,633. Starring Amanda Seyfried and Vanessa Redgrave, the Summit release, as one might expect, played 81% female with 63% of the audience being over 25. The film was a good counter product to the male-heavy action films and had a very strong CinemaScore of A- meaning good word of mouth could help propel this film to a strong finish.\n[rtimage]MapID=1212890&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nThe last of the three major films opening this weekend was the Queen Latifah starrer Just Wright. The romantic-comedy, which centers around a professional basketball player coming back from injury, opened with an estimated $8.5M and a per screen average of $4,642. The opening was decent, but not great, and should find a bigger audience on DVD for Fox Searchlight.\nLanding in the top five again in its eight weekend of release was Dreamworks’ How To Train Your Dragon which fell only 23% to $5.1M, according to estimates lifting the animation sensation to $207.7M. Falling 48% and landing in sixth place was Freddy Krueger and A Nightmare on Elm Street which slashed up an estimated $4.7M this weekend, bringing its cume to $56M.\n[rtimage]MapID=1226635&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nThe comedy pairing of Steve Carell and Tina Fey once again held on strongly, dropping only 26% from last weekend with Date Night, which grossed $4M, according to estimates, bringing its total to $86.7M. Fellow romantic-comedy The Back-up Plan hasn’t fared nearly as well, falling this weekend by 51%, to an estimated $2.5M, bringing its disappointing cume to $34.2M.\nRounding out the top 10 were two films with opposite trajectories. Furry Vengeance ended up in the 9th spot this week with an estimated $2.3M bringing its total to $15.1M, while Clash of the Titans took in an estimated $1.3M bringing its total to a robust $160.2M.\n[rtimage]MapID=1212891&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nThe top ten films grossed $132.3M which was up 3% from last year when Angels &amp; Demons opened in the top spot with $46.2M; and up 6% from 2008 when The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian opened at number one with $55M.\n                                            \n                \n            ","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"to, Oscars, awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Iron-Man-2-Tops-Robin-Hood"},{"id":"47509135704987","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Titans has a monster opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Titans has a monster openingPlus, Tyler Perry's latest does well, and Dragon falls to third.by Gitesh Pandya | April 5, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, proving it could attract big bucks from a 2D action film converted to 3D, Warner Bros. conquered the global box office with its epic remake Clash of the Titans which pulled in over $100M this weekend from theaters across the world powered by higher-priced tickets for the upgraded format. Audiences in North America had plenty of extra dollars to spare as Tyler Perry’s latest hit Why Did I Get Married Too? and the new Miley Cyrus drama The Last Song both connected with their respective fan bases enjoying solid openings. Add in a strong second frame for the 3D toon How To Train Your Dragon and the box office shattered records to become the largest Easter weekend in history as well as the biggest frame ever in the month of April.3D ruled once again as Clash of the Titans flexed major muscles with an estimated $61.4M debut making it the second highest opening weekend ever in April. The PG-13 film’s total counting Thursday night’s pre-midnight showtimes that began at 8pm reached an impressive $64.1M. The Greek mythology pic averaged a superb $16,256 from 3,777 theaters including 1,800 that offered 3D screens with added surcharges as high as $5 per ticket. Titans was intended to be a regular 2D release but was converted to 3D which opened the door to higher revenue potential. But with 3D films How to Train Your Dragon and Alice in Wonderland already on the calendar, Warner Bros. had to fight hard to secure 3D screens and even used analog equipment in order to lock in playdates.[rtimage]MapID=1212698&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=51&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Reviews were mostly negative with many critics highlighting how little of the film actually makes entertaining use of the extra-dimensional format. But the studio’s marketing materials sold Clash as an epic event film and the 3D element certainly boosted interest in the short-term. Word-of-mouth from moviegoers will be the key to the film’s future as marketing can only open the film. Buzz will have to carry it the rest of the way. Still, Clash powered its way to the second best April bow ever trailing only Fast &amp; Furious which debuted to $71M this weekend a year ago which was not the Easter frame.Overseas, the Perseus adventure collected an estimated $44.2M from 15 territories bringing its global bow to a massive $108.3M. 3D screens represented 30% of the venues but 55% of the gross. Titans was number one in all markets with several major countries still to open in the coming days like France, Germany, and Russia.Tyler Perry scored the second biggest opening of his career with his first sequel Why Did I Get Married Too? which bowed to an estimated $30.2M from 2,155 theaters for a sensational $13,993 average. The PG-13 followup on the filmmaker’s number one hit from 2007 reunited the cast including Perry and Janet Jackson and shifted the setting from a cold winter cabin to a tropical Bahamas resort. Too‘s opening was 41% bigger than the $21.4M bow of the first Married which was an October release. Perry’s latest hit even came close to the $34.3M debut of last fall’s mostly white couples-having-troubles comedy Couples Retreat despite playing in 845 fewer theaters.[rtimage]MapID=1210444&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Like all of Perry’s films, the new Married skewed toward an audience of mature black women. Studio research showed that 80% of the crowd was female, 75% was over 25, and 80% was African American. The director consistently brings his fan base out to theaters with a new offering twice a year and only last year’s Madea Goes to Jail debuted bigger with $41M. His past eight films have averaged a domestic gross of $53M while being produced for budgets of under $16M. For the month of April, Too ranks as the seventh biggest opener ever and the largest for a film opening in less than 3,000 theaters. Next up for the movie mogul is directing a different writer’s story with For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf featuring Jackson, Mariah Carey, and Whoopi Goldberg debuting over Martin Luther King weekend next January.Following a not-so-ferocious opening, the DreamWorks 3D animated film How To Train Your Dragon took advantage of strong word-of-mouth to enjoy the smallest decline in the top ten dipping only 33% to an estimated $29.2M. All others fell by more than 40%. The PG-rated film boosted its total to an encouraging $92.3M after ten days in theaters and is well-positioned to fly much higher in the weeks ahead. Compared to last spring’s 3D offering from DreamWorks Monsters vs. Aliens, Dragon opened 26% behind but after ten days the cume is now trailing by just 12%. And with virtually zero competition for young kids from April’s new releases, the Paramount release will easily outgross other non-sequel 3D kidpics like A Christmas Carol, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and G-Force. The final domestic gross for the $165M production could reach $175-185M with overseas markets kicking in an even greater tally.[rtimage]MapID=1194522&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Miley Cyrus took an important step in her career proving she can pull in business even when not playing Hannah Montana. The teen queen’s new romance The Last Song debuted to an estimated $16.2M over three days and $25.6M across its five-day Wednesday-to-Sunday debut period. Disney launched the film mid-week since much of the target audience of young girls was available thanks to spring school closings and the Good Friday holiday. Playing in 2,673 locations, the PG-rated pic averaged a solid $6,062 over three days and $9,574 over five days. Song, like most movies based on books by popular author Nicholas Sparks, was slammed by critics.Disney’s 3D smash Alice in Wonderland followed with an estimated $8.3M boosting the total to a stunning $309.8M. With two newer 3D films now in wide release, the Johnny Depp vehicle suffered the worst decline of its run tumbling 53%. But Alice climbed up to number 28 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters surpassing the $309.4M of 2007’s Disney-Depp project Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End. A final tally of roughly $325M seems likely for Tim Burton’s latest venture.[rtimage]MapID=1211803&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=24&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The R-rated comedy Hot Tub Time Machine held up reasonably well in its second weekend dropping 43% to an estimated $8M. MGM has grossed a lukewarm $27.8M in ten days and should finish with $40-45M. Sony’s The Bounty Hunter dropped 48% to an estimated $6.2M raising the cume for the Jennifer Aniston-Gerard Butler action comedy to a solid $49M. The middle school comedy Diary of a Wimpy Kid took in an estimated $5.5M, off 45%, giving Fox $46.2M to date.Paramount rounded out the top ten with a pair of films that grossed an estimated $1.46M a piece. The relationship comedy She’s Out of My League stumbled 58% and has laughed up $28.7M thus far. Martin Scorsese’s psychological thriller Shutter Island was down 54% in its seventh round and lifted the blockbuster sum to $123.4M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $167.9M which was up a healthy 38% from last year’s Easter frame when Hannah Montana The Movie opened in the top spot with $32.3M; and up a stellar 77% from 2008 when Horton Hears a Who remained at number one over the holiday with $24.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"It, impossible, trailers, horror, YouTube, monsters, tv, 2015, Walt, TV, Prime","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Titans-has-a-monster-opening"},{"id":"47509136884648","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Girlpower Rules Again with Princess at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Girlpower Rules Again with Princess at #1Invictus gets a red card.by Gitesh Pandya | December 13, 2009 |  CommentsFairy tales came true as mothers and daughters powered the animated film ThePrincess and the Frog to the number one spot in its first weekend ofnationwide release. But the frame’s only other wide opener, Clint Eastwood’sNelson Mandela drama Invictus, suffered a soft debut in third place. Overall, the NorthAmerican box office remained ahead of the same frame from a year ago as 2009continued on its record pace towards shattering the $10 billion mark for thefirst time ever.In a cartoon world ruled by computer animation and 3D wizardry, Disney went oldschool with its traditionally drawn pic ThePrincess and the Frog which won the box office crown with an estimated$25M this weekend. Following two weeks of exclusive play at solo theaters in NewYork and Los Angeles, the G-rated tale set in 1920s New Orleans won over kidswith a powerful $7,280 average from 3,434 theaters. Kidpics rarely break $20M onopening weekend in December unless they bow over the Christmas holiday frame.With holiday shopping and other activities becoming a top priority, parentsoften become less available for moviegoing at this time of year, but invade themultiplexes in large numbers come the 25th.[rtimage]MapID=1196003&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=58&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]TheMouse House has a decades-long history of making princess movies, and even inthe 1990s had multicultural female leads in major toons like Mulan, Aladdin, and Pocahontas. But Disney finally has its first blackprincess and audiences are giving her a big thumbs up. The bayou pic earned asolid A grade from CinemaScore indicating encouraging word-of-mouth ahead.Studio research showed that 64% of the audience was female, not surprisingly,and that 53% was under 25. Disney reported that the gender split began eveningout on Saturday and that more males are expected to come out over the long run.Princess continued a four-week streak of femme-skewing films ruling the chartsfollowing The Blind Side and New Moon.Sandra Bullock rushed past the $150M mark for the second time this year as hersurprise football hit The Blind Sideenjoyed another fantastic hold grossing an estimated $15.5M in its fourthweekend. Off a very slender 23%, the Warner Bros. hit lifted its domestic totalto $150.2M becoming the record fifteenth movie of 2009 to break thecentury-and-a-half barrier – the most in any one year. Only eleven filmssurpassed that level in 2008. With Avatar, Sherlock Holmes,and other potential blockbusters still to come, that figure is sure to grow.Blind Side is on course to race past the $200M mark too.The news wasn’t as good for Warners in third place where its Clint Eastwood filmInvictus ended upon its opening weekend. The Morgan Freeman-Matt Damon pic bowed to an estimated$9.1M from 2,125 theaters for a mild $4,275 average. The Nelson Mandela filmdebuted just like another Africa-set drama that the studio launched inmid-December – 2006’s Blood Diamond. That Leonardo DiCaprio pic debutedto $8.6M from 1,910 sites for a $4,528 average on its way to a $57.4M final cume.Invictus is already a bigger player during awards season than Diamondever was so it is likely to enjoy better legs in the weeks ahead.[rtimage]MapID=1207475&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Outsideof last winter’s Gran Torino, Eastwood’s directorial efforts never postlarge openings but rather attract a loyal older audience over time. Warner Bros.is expecting the same here looking at this weekend as just a chance to set thefilm up in the marketplace so as awards and nominations come in, it canimmediately benefit. The Oscar-winning director saw debuts of $9.4M for lastyear’s Changeling, $10.2M for Flags of Our Fathers, and $10.4M for2003’s Mystic River so he is in the same neighborhood once again. EvenMillion Dollar Baby opened to just $12.3M in its first wide weekend in lateJanuary of 2005 just days after it scored seven major Academy Award nominations.Still, Invictus is no easy-sell with its story of South African politicsand rugby plus its not-so-marketable title. Budgeted at $60M, the PG-13 filmwill need to rely on Best Actor kudos that Freeman is expected to receive forhis acclaimed performance in order to attract a larger audience. He’s alreadywon in that category with the National Board of Review (in a tie with GeorgeClooney for Up in the Air) and is expected to earn a Golden Globenomination this Tuesday. A windfall of Globe nominations including Best Pictureis what Invictus is hoping for to keep it relevant with movie audiences againsta wave of much bigger films about to flood theaters over the holidays.Dropping 48% to fourth place was The TwilightSaga: New Moon which pulled in another $8M, according to estimates,boosting the cume to $267.4M. The Summit release is the fifth biggestblockbuster of 2009 and still has a shot at reaching the triple century mark tochallenge Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince for the number two spotfor the year. James Cameron will also try to get in on that action with Avatar which invadestheaters on Friday riding a hot wave of anticipation and stellar early reviews.New Moon now sits at number 43 on the all-time blockbusters list inbetween the first Shrek and second Potter.[rtimage]MapID=1206167&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=65&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’sanimated holiday treat A ChristmasCarol followed in fifth with an estimated $6.9M slipping a mere 12% inits sixth round for a $124.5M cume. The Jim Carrey starrer is performing justlike the last motion capture Christmas flick from Robert Zemeckis, 2004’s ThePolar Express. That Tom Hanks vehicle dipped an identical 12% in its sixthweekend to a slightly better $8.4M pushing its total after six weekends to asimilar $123.4M. But Carol has the advantages of five years of ticketprice increases plus 3D surcharges so it is actually attracting a smalleraudience. A final take of around $155M could be possible.Lionsgate’s solider story Brothersfell 48% in its second mission to an estimated $5M raising the ten-day total to$17.4M. A $30M final could result. Disney’s star-driven comedy Old Dogswith John Travolta and Robin Williams slipped only 36% to an estimated $4.4M fora $40M sum.The doomsday thriller 2012grossed an estimated $4.4M, down just 35%, and climbed to $155.3M from NorthAmerica. Sony’s big-budget disaster flick ranks number 12 for the year havingjust zipped past the $155.1M of Fast &amp; Furious.

TheJason Reitman-directed pic expanded from 15 to 72 locations and averaged asturdy $34,028 per site. The well-reviewed film should continue to post muscularnumbers in limited play especially after it nabs some Golden Globe nominationsthis week. The wide break is scheduled for Christmas Day when it will have tocompete for adult audiences against the debuts of Sherlock Holmes and It’s Complicated.

Flip flopping positions, The Twilight Saga: New Moon finished in the runnerup spot while new releases were met with moderate to dismal results. It was typical for the frame as the weekend after the Thanksgiving holiday session always sees huge declines and unimpressive openings from new titles. But overall, the marketplace remained strong with sales up double digits over last year and 2007.\nCrowd favorite Sandra Bullock scored her second number one of the year with The Blind Side which climbed from second to first place with an estimated $20.4M for a relatively light 49% decline. Films usually drop by more than 55% on this particular weekend. After 17 days, the Warner Bros. release has banked an impressive $129.3M and has a good chance of rushing past the $200M mark once the holiday season passes. That would make Blind one of the top ten blockbusters of the year and the biggest hit of Bullock’s career surpassing the $164M of last summer’s The Proposal.\n[rtimage]MapID=1212694&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nThe pigskin pic also delivered the best gross for a number one film over this post-turkey frame since 2003 when The Last Samurai debuted on top with $24.3M. And it’s another overachiever for Warner Bros. following the summer smash The Hangover and Gran Torino which went wide in early January which both performed well above expectations for the studio which ranks number one in market share by a comfortable margin with a staggering $1.9 billion in sales year to date.\nFollowing its two-week reign at number one, The Twilight Saga: New Moon slipped to second place with an estimated $15.7M dropping a hefty 63% in its third session. This followed its 70% plunge in the sophomore frame. The teen wolves and vampires have now taken in a stellar $255.6M in just 17 days of release breaking the quarter-billion mark on Saturday in only its sixteenth day of play. New Moon is the sixth biggest blockbuster of 2009 and will surpass the $257.7M of Star Trek this week to make the top five. A final tally in the vicinity of $300M is still possible. Overseas, Edward and pals remained red hot pulling in an estimated $40.7M to propel the international cume to $314.5M and the global haul to $570.1M.\n[rtimage]MapID=1206167&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=59&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nLionsgate saw a solid debut for its soldier drama Brothers which led all new releases with a third place bow of $9.7M, according to estimates. The R-rated film played in 2,088 theaters and averaged a commendable $4,646 per site. Brothers stars Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Natalie Portman and attracted decent reviews. It was the best opening on the weekend after the Thanksgiving holiday frame since Aeon Flux‘s $12.7M from 2005.\nWith the Santa holiday approaching, Jim Carrey’s ","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Islander, Comic, Crackle, and, archives, king, Marvel, japanese, italian","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Blind-Side-Takes-the-Lead"},{"id":"47509136880550","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avatar, Sherlock, and Alvin Team Up To Break Records","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avatar, Sherlock, and Alvin Team Up To Break RecordsAvatar drops only 3% in its second weekend despite strong competitionby Gitesh Pandya | December 27, 2009 |  CommentsCapping off a record year that broke the $10 billion mark for the first time, audiences flooded the multiplexes over the Christmas holiday frame generating the largest weekend box office ever seen. Reigning champ Avatar led the way for a second consecutive time, but popular new releases Sherlock Holmes, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, and It’s Complicated all delivered sensational results with the quartet of hits combining for a staggering $213M in ticket sales leading the top ten to skyrocket to a jaw-dropping $260M. With studios offering a solid menu of appealing films, moviegoers came out in massive numbers as everyone had something to see.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=28&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]James Cameron was at it again. The Oscar-winning sci-fi guru enjoyed his second straight weekend at number one with the 3D epic Avatar which dipped a scant 3% in its sophomore frame to gross an estimated $75M shooting the ten-day total to an eye-popping $212.3M. The Fox blockbuster scored the second best second weekend gross in history trailing just The Dark Knight which followed up its record-breaking $158.4M debut with a 53% drop to $75.2M in its sophomore session in late July 2008. The only other films to gross more than $70M in their second weekends were Shrek 2 with $72.2M in 2004 and Spider-Man with $71.4M in 2002. All three of those films went on to finish north of $400M domestically and Avatar now seems on the same trajectory which would allow it to topple Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen to become the top-grossing film released in 2009.The 3D film took in $23.6M on Friday for Christmas Day, rose 21% to $28.6M on Saturday, and is estimated to slip by 20% on Sunday to $22.9M. With so many people off from work and school this coming week,Avatar‘s cume will continue to surge with the quarter-billion mark likely to crumble on Wednesday and the $300M level to be passed on Saturday with much more to come. The futuristic event film already ranks number seven for 2009 after just ten days and by next weekend it will shove aside Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince for the number two slot with its guns aimed squarely at Michael Bay’s toy robots.The holiday certainly helped the mega-budgeted actioner post such a great sophomore hold, but despite $155M in competition from the new wide releases, Avatar stayed strong because audiences have been liking and recommending the film. Cameron should have no problem becoming a filmmaker with two of the top ten blockbusters of all-time, maybe even two of the top five.[rtimage]MapID=10010659&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=48&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Robert Downey Jr. successfully launched his second major franchise in as many years with Sherlock Holmes which debuted in second place with a sizzling $65.4M for Warner Bros. The PG-13 film averaged a fantastic $18,031 from 3,626 locations and enjoyed the fifth biggest December opening of all-time. Directed by Guy Ritchie, the 1890-set pic co-stars Jude Law and Rachel McAdams. Holmes kicked off its weekend with $24.8M on Friday setting a new record for the best Christmas Day opening in history. Saturday dipped 11% to $22M while Sunday is projected to fall by 15% to $18.7M.The big-budget detective saga is intended to kick off a series of Holmes films that will keep the cash rolling in across this next decade. Critics gave good reviews and audiences so far have been moderately pleased. The London-set film actually opened at number one on Friday edging out Avatar by $1.2M, but dropped on Saturday while the Pandora flick rose. Add in Iron Man, Tropic Thunder, and this May’s Iron Man 2, and Downey will end up scoring four $100M+ blockbusters (including three over $200M) in a two-year span pulling off an amazing Hollywood comeback after many had written him off after his many drug problems.[rtimage]MapID=1209288&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=12&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Never before has a film opened to more than $50M and failed to capture one of the top two spots. But that’s what happened with the hit kidpic Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel which bowed to $50.2M giving it the best gross ever for a third-place debut. Fox found great success with families by following up on its 2007 sensation and averaged a potent $13,568 from 3,700 locations this weekend. Launching on Wednesday to capture kids already out of school, the PG-rated Squeakquel banked a stellar $77.1M over its first five days.The first Chipmunks opened in second place two years ago to $44.3M over three days on its way to a sensational $217.3M making a sequel a no-brainer. With students out of class the whole week ahead, Fox will see its cume climb rapidly. Between its two megahits, the studio hauled in a stunning $179M over the last five days.[rtimage]MapID=1208806&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=25&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Universal landed in fourth with its new divorce comedy It’s Complicated which grossed an estimated $22.1M from 2,887 sites for a very good $7,660 average. The R-rated pic starring Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin played to an older female audience with studio research showing that 72% of the crowd was female and 75% was 30 and older. Complicated earned an encouraging A- grade from CinemaScore and given that other December releases from director Nancy Meyers like Something’s Gotta Give and The Holiday went on to reach totals that were five times their opening or more, the studio believes it has a long-lasting hit on its hands. This should become yet another $100M+ hit for Streep.Paramount expanded its George Clooney-starrer Up in the Air nationwide and landed in fifth place with an estimated $11.8M from 1,895 locations. Averaging a solid $6,203 per site, the R-rated film raised its total to $24.5M and will try to show some legs in January utilizing possible Golden Globe wins and Oscar nominations to keep the momentum going. It was an encouraging result given all the potent competition for adult audiences in the marketplace.Sandra Bullock’s durable hit The Blind Side followed close behind in sixth with an estimated $11.7M, up a healthy 17% from last weekend, to lift the amazing cume to $184.4M. The Warner Bros. football drama became the only film of 2009 to gross more than $10M for six straight weekends. It also rose up to number ten among this year’s top blockbusters and will easily rush past the $200M mark.The grand return of the chipmunks spelled doom for Disney’s The Princess and the Frog which witnessed the largest drop of any film in the top ten. The traditional toon fell 29% to an estimated $8.7M boosting the cume to $63.4M. An royal invite to the $100M club is now not guaranteed.[rtimage]MapID=1200643&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Christmas box office didn’t have room for every single film and coming in at number eight was one of the frame’s casualties, the musical Nine, which expanded nationwide but grossed just $5.5M according to estimates. The Weinstein Co. played the Daniel Day-Lewis starrer in limited release for only one week before widening and wound up with a weak $3,926 average from 1,412 locations. Competition was intense for the target audience of adult women and moviegoers chose other options. Cume to date is just $5.9M.Moviegoers weren’t too excited about Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker as their romantic comedy Did You Hear About the Morgans? performed poorly again with an estimated $5M in its second weekend. Down 24% from its opening, the Sony release has taken in just $15.6M and has been utterly rejected by audiences. Also not faring well was Clint Eastwood’s Invictus with Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon which rounded out the top ten with an estimated $4.4M. Sales inched up 4%, but the Warner Bros. title has banked only $23.4M to date and won’t be collecting much more in the weeks ahead.The top ten films grossed a record estimate of $259.8M which was up 53% from last year when Marley &amp; Me opened in the top spot with $36.4M; and up 64% from 2007 when National Treasure: The Book of Secrets stayed on top with $36.7M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"cinematic, VH1, reboot, breaking, Studios, saw, Red, zero, Islander","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Avatar-Sherlock-and-Alvin-Team-Up-To-Break-Records"},{"id":"47509138516925","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Brüno Struts To The Top Spot","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

MattDamon and Jennifer Aniston generated unimpressive numbers for their debutingfilms TheInformant! and Love Happens, respectively, while Megan Fox failedto lure in ticket buyers to her horror entry Jennifer’s Body.Overall, the North American box office did see a healthy double-digit gain overlast year.Movie fans of all ages lined up for Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs making it the fifth 3D film of theyear to open atop the box office chart. The PG-rated toon took in an estimated$30.1M from 3,119 theaters averaging a hearty $9,651 per site. If estimateshold, it will rank as the third best opening in the notoriously slow month ofSeptember trailing Sweet Home Alabama ($35.6M in 2002) and Rush Hour($33M in 1998).[rtimage]MapID=1196077&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Aswith most 3D films before it, Meatballs set a new record for the widestbow for an extra-dimensional pic with 1,828 (59%) of the theaters offering the3D version including 127 IMAX 3D venues. Many of the multiplexes also devoted atleast one screen to the 2D version for those moviegoers that didn’t want to paythe higher ticket price for 3D. The studio estimated that between $17.5M and$18M of the weekend gross came from the 3D screens with industry leader RealDstated that more than $16M of that figure came from their screens. IMAX sitesdelivered $2.5M. Despite the cost, moviegoers still found it worthy to pay for3D entertainment on the big screen keeping the year-long boom alive and kicking.The forecast is bright for Cloudy as the weeks ahead should continue toflourish. Critics raved about the film, audiences were very pleased with thoseunder 24 giving it an A grade from CinemaScore, and the road ahead offers fewother options for kids. Disney rolls out its double feature of Toy Story &amp;Toy Story 2 in 3D on October 2 but the next major new film for familiescomes on October 16 with Where the Wild Things Are. Wild and Cloudy are both movie versions of popular kids books.[rtimage]MapID=1196077&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Withstudios and exhibitors still working together to put 3D into every cinema in thecountry, Cloudy‘s stronger-than-expected opening proves that consumerdemand is still healthy for engaging films in the format, even if they don’tcome from DreamWorks, Pixar, or Disney. Other 3D films that opened at number onethis year include March’s Monsters vs. Aliens, May’s Up, July’s G-Force, and August’s horror film The Final Destination. In addition,Ice Age 3 has grossed $195M domestically since debuting in second placein July behind the second weekend of the Transformers sequel. Those five3D films have collectively grossed a whopping $864M from North America alone andCloudy stands a chance of adding in another $100M or more.Opening in second place with a mediocre launch was the Matt Damon undercoverdrama TheInformant! which grossed an estimated $10.5M from 2,505 theaters.Averaging a so-so $4,210 per site, the R-rated Warner Bros release from directorSteven Soderbergh was marketed as a comedy caper pic and played to matureadults. The opening was worse than the debuts for other adult-skewingstar-driven dramas from this year like State of Play ($14.1M) and Duplicity ($14M) and was just barely ahead of the $9.7M of The Soloistshowing once again how difficult it can be for studios to draw in payingcustomers with these types of movies. Reviews were generally good for Informant and Damon is a big star, but outside of the Bournefranchise he has troubling anchoring a hit all by himself.[rtimage]MapID=1200661&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=32&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]TylerPerry fell two spots to third place with his latest filmI Can Do Bad All By Myself which grossed an estimated $10.1M,off a steep 57% in its second weekend. The sophomore drop was almost identicalto the 58% fall that the filmmaker’s The Family That Preys suffered oneyear ago this weekend and was slightly better than the 61% tumble thatFebruary’s Madea Goes to Jail witnessed. After ten days, Myselfhas banked a solid $37.9M and looks headed for a $50-55M final.Jennifer Aniston found herself in fourth place with the new romantic dramaLove Happenswhich bowed to an estimated $8.5M. The Universal release averaged a mild $4,455per location and launched in the fewest theaters among the new films with only1,898 sites. The PG-13 love story had little appeal outside of its core audienceof adult women. Studio research showed that 78% of the crowd was female and 71%was 30 or older. Budgeted at only $18M, Love was not too expensive of agamble and did show that outside of comedies, the former Friends starAniston is not necessarily a bankable draw at the box office.[rtimage]MapID=1213771&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Havingthe least bite among the weekend’s four new releases was the Megan Fox-ledhorror flick Jennifer’s Body which collected just $6.8M, according to estimates, froma very wide 2,702 theaters for a dismal $2,517 average. Despite being one ofHollywood’s most followed celebrities, the Transformers starlet failed topull moviegoers into the multiplexes. Body had a strong marketing pushfrom 20th Century Fox and even some starpower from Oscar-winning writer DiabloCody. But the overabundance of horror films in recent weeks took its toll andFox could not flex any muscles when it came to anchoring her first major film.Her agents will now have difficulty landing big paydays for future films.With its R rating, Jennifer’s Body skewed towards young adults andsuccessfully played to both genders. Studio research showed that 70% of theaudience was under 25 and 51% was female. Reviews were not too good, but mosthorror films are treated that way from critics.

The Nazi flick grossed an estimated $3.6M, down41%, for a $109.9M cume for The Weinstein Co. That edged out the director’sprevious best in North America, 1994’s Pulp Fiction with $108M from theWeinstein-led Miramax. Of course, ticket prices were much lower 15 years ago soFiction has still sold about 73% more stubs. Overseas where Universal ishandling the release, Basterds upped its total to $115.7M beating the$111.4M of 2003’s Kill Bill Vol. 1 which was Tarantino’s previous high.The global tally for the Brad Pitt starrer stands at $225.6M on its way to atleast $260M.[rtimage]MapID=1200615&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=66&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Dropping 40% to eighth place was Sandra Bullock’s All About Stevewith an estimated $3.4M and $26.7M total for Fox.

Joe drops, The Time Traveler's Wife takes third, and other openers falter.by Gitesh Pandya | August 16, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend Audiences went alien crazy as the sci-fi action drama District 9 rode a wave of strong buzz, slick marketing, and stellar reviews to debut easily at number one powering ahead of expectations. The counter-programming romance The Time Traveler’s Wife fared well in its opening weekend while the frame’s three other new releases struggled to find paying customers with the summer movie season slowly winding down. But the top ten saw encouraging double-digit gains over last year and 2007 as the marketplace continued to attract a sizable amount of business.Bowing impressively at number one, District 9 took in an estimated $37M for Sony from 3,049 theaters for a muscular $12,135 average. The R-rated story about humans trying to relocate an alien population living in South Africa was directed by rookie feature helmer Neill Blomkamp and was produced by Oscar winner Peter Jackson. The marketing campaign was brilliantly executed and highlighted Jackson (the only known star attached to the project) plus engaged moviegoers with its alien invasion theme. The studio also got the film on the map with sci-fi fans with its screening at Comic-Con three weeks ago which got excitement going. It was the perfect place for a tough-sell like D9 to attack.[rtimage]MapID=1190668&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Budgeted at only $30M, the Johannesburg-set flick played to adult men with studio research showing that 64% of the audience was male and 57% was 25 or older. Critics poured on the praise which came in very handy for a non-star pic like this. Sony acquired rights for numerous markets around the world for just $25M and should be able to turn it into a moneymaker quickly. Saturday sales dipped by 10% from Friday which was normal for this type of genre film. District 9‘s opening even came close to the $40.1M bow of last year’s PG-13 documentary-style no-star monster attack film Cloverfield.Last weekend’s top film G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra tumbled an understandable 59% to an estimated $22.5M in its second weekend. After ten days of play, the $175M production is on the verge of hitting the $100M mark with $98.8M in the bank. Paramount should finish off in the vicinity of $150M from North America. Along with Star Trek and the Transformers sequel, the studio will end up scoring about $800M from its trio of effects-heavy action tentpoles with more installments to come in the years ahead.[rtimage]MapID=1193682&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=30&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Women powered the sci-fi romance The Time Traveler’s Wife to a third place opening with an estimated $19.2M in sales on the first weekend. The Warner Bros. release landed in 2,988 sites and averaged a good $6,427 per site. But the Rachel McAdams-Eric Bana pic may be in for a stormy relationship in the weeks ahead as reviews were mostly negative and grosses fell 17% on Saturday after a strong opening day indicating moviegoers are not too enamored with what they are seeing. By comparison, last weekend’s female-skewing newbie Julie &amp; Julia enjoyed a healthy 17% Friday-to-Saturday boost.Meryl Streep’s Julia held up well against the new female-skewing competitor and dropped 38% to an estimated $12.4M. Produced for $38M, the Sony release has cooked up a solid $43.7M in ten days and looks headed for the neighborhood of $75M. The Disney action hit G-Force slipped just 30% to an estimated $6.9M boosting the total to $99M. It will break nine digits on Monday or Tuesday.[rtimage]MapID=1207146&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Opening poorly in sixth was the used car salesmen comedy The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard with just $5.4M, according to estimates, which translated to a weak $2,911 from 1,838 sites. The R-rated pic stars Jeremy Piven who attracts millions on television to his acclaimed series Entourage, but has yet to prove himself as a box office draw.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince followed in seventh with an estimated $5.2M, down 42%, for a $283.9M total to date. That’s about even with the fifth weekend of the last wizard flick Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which grossed $5.4M, off 43%, for a $272M cume. Compared to Phoenix, Prince is running 4% ahead in grosses but 2% behind in admissions. Overseas, the new Hogwarts chapter grossed an estimated $14.5M to lift the international cume to $577.7M and the worldwide total to a staggering $861.6M.Placing eighth with just a 33% decline was the R-rated romantic comedy The Ugly Truth which collected an estimated $4.5M putting Sony’s total at $77.5M.[rtimage]MapID=10010453&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s attempt at showing a nationwide audience the brilliance of Hayao Miyazaki’s latest animated film Ponyo met with only modest results. The G-rated tale of a fish that wishes to be human bowed to an estimated $3.5M from 927 locations for a mild $3,782 average. The legendary Japanese filmmaker’s last two films, the Academy Award-winning Spirited Away and Howl’s Moving Castle, were also released by the Mouse House but in only limited markets appealing to a small but loyal following. A box office juggernaut in Japan and Asia, Miyazaki has not found mainstream commercial success in America yet.Two films tied for tenth with an estimated $3M a piece. Fox Searchlight’s indie hit (500) Days of Summer expanded by 231 locations to 1,048 sites for a 19% dip in its weekend gross lifting the total to $18M. Universal’s Funny People continued to repel audiences crumbling 62% in its third round putting the cume at $47.9M.[rtimage]MapID=1205730&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=7&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Virtually ignored by audiences was the new high school comedy Bandslam which opened to an estimated $2.3M from 2,121 theaters for a dismal $1,061 average. Summit tried to boost interest by playing the new Twilight teaser with the PG-rated film, but tween girls didn’t fall for it and spent their dollars elsewhere.The top ten films grossed an estimated $119.5M which was up 12% from last year when Tropic Thunder opened in the top spot with $25.8M; and up 10% from 2007 when Superbad debuted at number one with $33.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"USA, ABC, Marathons, TLC, prank, Swim, Certified, WGN, OWN, HBO, television, Month, female, New","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Crowds-Flock-to-District-9"},{"id":"47509139967942","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Angels Floats to a #1 Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Angels Floats to a #1 DebutStar Trek and Wolverine round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | May 17, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard reteamed for their second Robert Langdon adventure Angels &amp; Demons and reached number one with an opening that was respectable, but not spectacular. More impressive was the remarkable second weekend hold that the sci-fi actioner Star Trek enjoyed close behind in the runnerup spot. A mere $5M separated the two films even though Trek has been in theaters a week longer. With only one new opener, most holdovers saw relatively low declines as for the first time since early February, no film in the top ten dropped by more than 50%.Taking over the top spot this weekend, Angels &amp; Demons debuted with an estimated $48M from 3,527 theaters for a solid $13,609 average per location. The PG-13 film starred Hanks in his second turn as Harvard symbologist Langdon with Howard directing once again. The two first joined forces for the book-to-film franchise with 2006’s The Da Vinci Code which opened on this same weekend to a sensational $77.1M. By comparison, Angels bowed 38% smaller and sold 44% fewer tickets on opening weekend. Estimated admissions in the first three days were about 11 million for Code and around 6 million for Angels.[rtimage]MapID=1189217&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=13&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The new film was not expected to come close to Da Vinci‘s numbers for a few reasons. Code was based on a much more popular book selling over 80 million copies, roughly twice as many as Angels which was published earlier. Code also attracted global controversy surrounding its religious subject matter which angered the Catholic Church which took a more laid back approach this time. The religious community did not want to help make the filmmakers rich again. The 2006 film also generated buzz for being the first project involving a Dan Brown novel. Angels entered the marketplace feeling like more of the same. Hanks and Howard were also very clear in their press interviews in recent weeks that people who might be offended by the storyline should not come out and buy tickets. Those folks apparently listened.But many expected Demons to open with at least $50M as there were no other new films competing against it. Plus the weekend before the Memorial Day holiday frame is one of Hollywood’s biggest launching pads for franchise films. Angels delivered the lowest opening for this weekend since 2000’s animated film Dinosaur which bowed to $38.9M for Disney (more than $52M at today’s prices). The better-than-expected hold by the buzzworthy Star Trek may also have contributed. For 2009 openers, the new Hanks vehicle ranks only sixth.[rtimage]MapID=1189217&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Angels earned slightly better reviews than Da Vinci and still played to a mature adult audience. Studio research showed that females made up 52% of the audience and those over and under the age of 30 were split evenly.As with the last Langdon flick, Sony opened Angels &amp; Demons in almost every major international market on the same weekend. The new Vatican pic performed exceptionally well grossing an estimated $104.3M this weekend from top spot bows in all 96 territories for a global opening of $152.3M. International markets were crucial to the runaway success of The Da Vinci Code which collected a stunning 71% of its $757M worldwide total from outside of North America. The domestic take was a still solid $217.5M.With bigger paychecks for the principals, Angels &amp; Demons carried a price tag of about $150M and has the potential to reach $400M or more globally. Da Vinci cost $125M.[rtimage]MapID=1186973&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Displaying amazing legs in its second weekend was the sci-fi reboot Star Trek which dropped by only 43% to bank an estimated $43M for a sturdy second place finish. That boosted the cume for the Paramount franchise flick to a stunning $147.6M in only 10.5 days. It was the biggest second weekend haul for any film since last summer’s juggernaut The Dark Knight which grossed an eye-popping $75.2M in its sophomore session.Trek‘s electric word-of-mouth has been spreading allowing the action pic to win new fans, generate repeat business, and keep Imax auditoriums full. In fact on Saturday, it was the number one film in North America edging out Angels &amp; Demons by $500,000 thanks to a healthy 56% Friday-to-Saturday bump compared to just 8% for the Hanks film.[rtimage]MapID=1186973&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=28&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A 43% decline on the second weekend is unusually rare for heavily hyped sci-fi and action films. Trek‘s performance beat out sophomore drops for such blockbuster franchise tentpoles as The Dark Knight (53%), Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (55%), Quantum of Solace (60%), and Fast &amp; Furious (62%). It was even better than the 48% fall that Iron Man witnessed on its way to a long and durable run during the summer box office last year. The Marvel hero was also released by Paramount with Thursday night previews and its $177.8M cume in the first 10.5 days accounted for 56% of its eventual $318.4M domestic final.By Tuesday, the Kirk-and-Spock adventure will overtake Wolverine to become the top grossing summer film and will set the standard that all future event films this year will try to live up to. Based on its current course, the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise should make its way past the $250M mark in North America and could soar much higher if it keeps playing this well.Overseas, where the franchise has never been all that strong, the new Star Trek is working and playing like a fun action film for all audiences. This weekend it grossed another $21M from 57 markets to boost the foreign total to $70M and the global gross to $217.6M.[rtimage]MapID=1189045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Former number one X-Men Origins: Wolverine fell a reasonable 44% in its third weekend to an estimated $14.8M pushing the 17-day total to $151.1M. A final domestic tally of $180-190M seems possible for Fox. Overseas, the Hugh Jackman actioner sliced up $13.5M from an ultrawide 103 markets raising the international haul to $144.5M and the worldwide tally to $295.6M.With the mutant prequel and the Enterprise reboot, the box office has now seen a whopping seven films this year surpass $140M. Only two had reached that level at this same point last year — Iron Man and Horton Hears a Who.Together, Wolverine, Trek, and Demons have grossed a combined $666M from theaters around the world kickstarting what should be a red hot summer ahead with likely blockbusters from the Terminator, Night at the Museum, Transformers, and Harry Potter franchises still to come.[rtimage]MapID=1193906&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Matthew McConaughey’s latest turn at a charismatic stud in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past saw a 33% drop to an estimated $6.9M pushing the 17-day total to a solid $40.1M for Warner Bros. The wedding-themed date film is running 18% ahead of last May’s chick flick offering Made of Honor. In its fourth weekend, the Beyoncé Knowles thriller Obsessed took in an estimated $4.6M for Sony, off just 31%, for a $62.6M cume.The high school comedy 17 Again followed dipping a mere 20% to an estimated $3.4M putting the Warner Bros. hit at $58.4M to date. The Zac Efron pic reached $48.3M overseas allowing the global gross to climb to an impressive $106.7M. Still the top-grossing blockbuster of 2009, the hit toon Monsters vs. Aliens landed in seventh place in its eighth weekend with an estimated $3M. Sliding a scant 8%, the DreamWorks pic has upped its sum to $190.6M and looks likely to become the animation studio’s fifth feature to break the $200M mark joining Kung Fu Panda and the three helpings of Shrek.[rtimage]MapID=10010788&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=11&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Rounding out the top ten were the Robert Downey Jr.-Jamie Foxx drama The Soloist with an estimated $2.4M, the Donald Faison-Mike Epps comedy Next Day Air with an estimated $2.3M, and the nature documentary Earth with an estimated $1.7M. Respective totals stand at $27.5M for Paramount, $7.6M for Summit, and $29.1M for Disney.Despite mixed reviews, Summit’s indie comedy The Brothers Bloom fared well in its limited opening with an estimated $82,000 from only four theaters in New York and Los Angeles for a robust $20,500 average. The Adrien Brody-Mark Ruffalo starrer will expand to the Top 15 markets on Friday for the long weekend hoping to give arthouse audiences an alternative to all the mindless popcorn fare.The top ten films grossed an estimated $130M which was up 4% from last year when The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian opened in the top spot with $55M; but down 24% from 2007 when Shrek the Third debuted at number one with $121.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandyawww.boxofficeguru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"jones, on, Plus, NYCC, HBO, Amazon, motion, awards, tv, Apple, Trek, Holiday, NBC, Horse, cats","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Angels-Floats-to-a-1-Debut"},{"id":"47509139971015","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Star Trek Soars To $76M Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Star Trek Soars To $76M OpeningWolverine takes a 68% dive in its second week.by Gitesh Pandya | May 10, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend a classic franchise was reborn as North American moviegoers came out in strong numbers for the new Star Trek which grossed an estimated $76.5M over its extended three-and-a-half-day debut. The impressive figure consists of roughly $4M from early showtimes that began at 7pm on Thursday evening and $72.5M across the standard Friday-to-Sunday period.The $125M Paramount production was a gamble that paid off as the franchise was left for dead after the last installment, 2002’s Star Trek: Nemesis, grossed a dismal $43.1M striking out with fans worldwide. The new Trek averaged a solid $18,836 over the three-day period from 3,849 theaters including 138 Imax venues. The $72.5M figure represented the biggest opening ever in franchise history more than doubling the $30.7M of 1996’s First Contact, the previous best in the eleven-pic series. But comparisons are not fair since previous films were made for the die-hard fans and enjoyed much lower ticket prices. The new Trek was a reboot with a new younger cast that played to fans and to general action audiences too.[rtimage]MapID=1186973&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Breaking down the 3.5-day opening weekend, Star Trek launched on Friday with $30.8M including about $4M from Thursday previews. Saturday fell 11% to $27.4M, and Sunday is estimated to slide by 33% to $18.3M. The three-day tally also ranked as the second biggest debut of 2009 trailing only last weekend’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine which launched with $85.1M.Reviews were fantastic for Star Trek which were key in allowing the J.J. Abrams-directed hit to reach a broader audience. If strong word-of-mouth kicks in, the U.S.S. Enterprise and its crew could go on to lofty heights.Following its muscular top spot bow last weekend kicking off the summer movie season, X-Men Origins: Wolverine took a freefall in its second weekend plunging 68% to an estimated $27M for second place. The sharp drop was even bigger than the ones suffered by other effects-driven action films opening on the first weekend of May like 2007’s Spider-Man 3 (62%), 2004’s Van Helsing (60%), and 2003’s X2: X-Men United (53%). Star Trek, and its appeal to much of the same audience, took its toll on the mutant prequel as did mixed reactions from fans. Wolverine played out more like March’s super hero saga Watchmen which also tumbled 68% in its second weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1189045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After ten days, the Hugh Jackman starrer has banked $129.6M. Spider-Man 3 and Watchmen collected 70-80% of their domestic totals in the first ten days and Wolverine shows no sign of being different. Budgeted at $130M, Origins should finish in the vicinity of $170M.The romantic comedy Ghosts of Girlfriends Past held up well in its second weekend declining by 32% to an estimated $10.5M. After ten days, the Matthew McConaughey pic has taken in a respectable $30.2M and could be headed for a $50-60M finish. The Warner Bros. release will try to continue to counter May’s testosterone action flicks and cater to underserved female audiences.[rtimage]MapID=1193906&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Beyonce Knowles fell to fourth place with her hit thriller Obsessed which grossed an estimated $6.6M, off 45%, for a solid cume of $56.2M for Sony. Teen king Zac Efron followed with his high school comedy 17 Again which dipped 31% to an estimated $4.4M giving Warner Bros. $54.2M to date. An amazing 22 new releases in 2009 have crossed the $50M mark compared to 14 from the same period last year.Summit stumbled into sixth place with its new comedy Next Day Air which debuted with an estimated $4M. Starring Donald Faison, Mike Epps, and Mos Def, the R-rated pic averaged a mild $3,515 from 1,138 theaters.[rtimage]MapID=10010788&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=11&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Paramount’s disappointing drama The Soloist followed with an estimated $3.6M, down 36%, for a $23.5M total. Holding up well in its seventh frame with an estimated $3.4M was the Paramount/DreamWorks toon Monsters vs. Aliens which eased by only 42% boosting the domestic total to a sturdy $186.9M.Disney’s nature doc Earth collected an estimated $2.5M, off 43%, for a $26.1M sum to date.

With only one new wide release making anyimpact, most holdovers remained sturdy with relatively low declines. Meanwhilewith awards season getting more active, an assortment of acclaimed films debutedin limited release with all showing muscular numbers.

The PG-13 film is an effects-driven disaster movie and delivereda well-needed hit to Fox which has been struggling at the box office since lastspring.

Friday got off to a solid start with $11.6M in ticket sales,Saturday inched up 2% to $11.8M, and the studio is estimating a 36% Sunday dropto $7.6M. The grosses include the 120 Imax locations that are also playing Earthwith higher-priced tickets. Reviews were mostly negative and early audiencefeedback is not looking good either so the long-term outlook is iffy.Compared to other non-sequel non-summer action films from this year, Earth’sdebut came in below the $40.1M of Cloverfield and the $35.9M of 10,000B.C. Neither of those had any stars either. The performance was on par withthe debut of the 2005 Reeves vehicle Constantine which grossed $29.8Mover the Friday-to-Sunday portion of its holiday opening, or $33M at today’sticket prices. That R-rated sci-fi thriller went on to finish with $75.5M, or$84M at 2008 prices. The former Neo has been absent from the number one spot forfive long years.

The PG-13 film features a mostly Latino cast and averaged aweak $2,095 from 1,671 locations.

The performance wasespecially potent since the film clocks in at over four hours leaving thetheaters to offer just two showings per day.

Contrary to previous estimates, the box office actuals reveal that The Hangover brought in just under $45 million while Pixar’s Up raked in just over $44 million in its second week of release. Estimates had Up at $44.2 million and The Hangover at $43.3 million. Will Ferrell’s latest, Land of the Lost also came in a little lower than the weekend estimates predicted, earning $18.8 million, but the rest of the top 12 were fairly accurate. It’s not often that a movie will take the box office crown on the last day, but it was very close this weekend between the top two, and it made for an exciting race.*****This weekend audiences embraced two very different films as the animated blockbuster Up from Disney/Pixar won a close race to retain its position at number one while the raunchy new comedy The Hangover opened stronger than expected finishing close behind in second place. Will Ferrell’s time travel action-comedy Land of the Lost had trouble finding audiences with a disappointing third place debut. With big Hollywood actors asking for more and more money, moviegoers spent their cash on two crowd pleasers lacking any major star names.It was a close race for the box office crown but despite losing the Friday battle, muscular Saturday and Sunday sales lifted Up to another weekend in first place with an estimated $44.2M. Off only 35%, the PG-rated hit has now upped its ten-day cume to a robust $137.3M. If the estimate holds, it will be the largest second weekend gross for any film since last summer’s The Dark Knight.[rtimage]MapID=1195997&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=17&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Sensational word-of-mouth, glowing reviews, and a lack of offerings for young children now starting their summer breaks all contributed to the fantastic performance. Up enjoyed one of the better sophomore holds for a Pixar film declining less than WALL•E (49%), Ratatouille (38%), and Cars (44%) from the last three summers. It also held up better than the most recent offerings from rival DreamWorks which unleashed its last three titles over the past year – 3D pic Monsters vs. Aliens (45%), Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (45%), and Kung Fu Panda (44%). Up is on course to fly higher than all six of those hits by the end of its run reaching $275M, and possibly $300M, from North America alone making it the second biggest Pixar smash ever behind just Finding Nemo‘s $339.7M.Helped by the surcharges it is collecting from the 3D screens, Up is set to take on Pixar’s two biggest hits Nemo and The Incredibles. Nemo, which opened on the same weekend as Up in 2003, slid by only 34% in its second session for a ten-day tally of $144M. The following year’s Incredibles bowed in early November, dropped just 29% in its second try, and banked $143.3M after ten days. It ended with $261.4M which Up looks to soar past.[rtimage]MapID=1195997&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=28&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The weekend’s big surprise came in the number two slot as the post-bachelor party comedy The Hangover flew past expectations to a stunning $43.3M opening weekend, according to estimates. The R-rated pic averaged a scorching $13,238 from 3,269 theaters for the best average of the frame. Directed by Todd Phillips (Old School, Starsky &amp; Hutch), Hangover enjoyed the third biggest opening in box office history for an R-rated comedy. Only Sex and the City ($56.8M) and American Pie 2 ($45.1M) debuted better and both capitalized on built-in audiences which Hangover did not have.Reviews were very positive and word-of-mouth from advance screenings helped to fuel excitement. Hangover easily beat out the debuts of other raunchy summer laughers with the same rating like Wedding Crashers ($33.9M), Knocked Up ($30.7M), and Superbad ($33.1M). However, one trouble spot came from the Saturday gross which dropped a troubling 9% from Friday’s stellar $16.5M opening day bow. Next weekend’s results will determine whether fans rushed out upfront, or if recommendations can help broaden the audience. But with a production cost of under $30M, The Hangover will certainly become a financial winner for Warner Bros. which already has a sequel in the works with Phillips and lead actors Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms signed.[rtimage]MapID=1207417&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Looking like the first big clunker of the summer movie season, Universal’s adventure-comedy Land of the Lost debuted weaker than expected in third place with an estimated $19.5M. The PG-13 pic launched ultrawide in 3,521 locations but averaged a mild $5,545. With Will Ferrell’s salary and special effects, the remake cost over $100M to produce and needed a bigger opening in order to find the land of profitability. The bow was even worse than the $20.1M of Ferrell’s last summer TV remake Bewitched from June 2005. Apparently, he did not learn his lesson.Lost entered the marketplace trying to appeal to both families and to the comedian’s fan following, but the well-received Up and Hangover stole away much of those respective crowds. The PG-rated Night at the Museum sequel still sold a solid amount of tickets providing even more competition for those seeking adventure and laughs. Plus Lost‘s bad reviews and rating made parents think twice before taking their younger children. A weak product, intense competition, and source material that wasn’t wildly popular to begin with all contributed to Land of the Lost becoming this summer’s Speed Racer.[rtimage]MapID=1189343&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=11&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Dropping 40% in its third weekend was Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian which grossed an estimated $14.7M. Fox’s action-comedy sequel has banked $127.3M in 17 days, off 22% from the pace of its 2006 predecessor. Paramount’s blockbuster reboot Star Trek followed with an estimated $8.4M, down only 33%, for a stellar total of $222.8M.Sci-fi audiences have been spending half as much money on Terminator Salvation which fell 50% in its third mission to an estimated $8.2M. The Warner Bros. release became the year’s twelfth pic to break $100M on Saturday and raised its cume to $105.5M. Given its $200M production cost, the domestic results remain underwhelming. But overseas, Sony launched the John Connor saga this weekend and pulled in an impressive $67.5M haul ranking number one in 66 of its 70 markets. The international total stands at $97.2M and will quickly surpass the North American tally by the end of the week. Sony purchased rights for most overseas territories. Compared to 2003’s T3: Rise of the Machines, Salvation is running 21% ahead internationally for Sony but is lagging 17% behind domestically for Warner. Bros.[rtimage]MapID=1197277&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=25&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Devilish films took up the next two spots. Sam Raimi’s Drag Me to Hell tumbled 54% in its second scare grossing an estimated $7.3M for a ten-day tally of $28.5M. Look for the Universal fright flick to end with $40-45M. Angels &amp; Demons followed with an estimated $6.5M, down 43%, giving Sony a domestic take of $116.1M – down 39% from the pace of 2006’s The Da Vinci Code. Demons collected $22.3M overseas this weekend to push the international total to $292.9M and the global gross to $409M making it the top-grossing film worldwide this year.The tour guide comedy My Life in Ruins created no excitement with moviegoers opening poorly in ninth place with an estimated $3.2M. The Fox Searchlight pic averaged a weak $2,771 from 1,164 locations and was panned by critics. Rounding out the top ten was the spoof comedy Dance Flick with an estimated $2M, stumbling a steep 58% in its third round, for a sum to date of just $22.7M for Paramount.[rtimage]MapID=1201387&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=8&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Focus got off to a sizzling start with its pregnancy comedy Away We Go which bowed in four theaters with an estimated $143,260 for a potent average of $35,815. Directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Revolutionary Road), the R-rated dysfunctional family pic stars NBC faces John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph and earned mixed reviews from critics. Away expands to over 30 sites across numerous top markets next weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $157.3M which was down 7% from last year when Kung Fu Panda opened in the top spot with $60.2M; but up 22% from 2007 when Ocean’s Thirteen debuted at number one with $36.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandyawww.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"thriller, cops, harry, parents, Fire","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-The-Hangover-edges-out-Up-for-top-spot"},{"id":"47509142512601","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Marley Takes #1, The Spirit Tanks","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Marley Takes #1, The Spirit TanksBedtime Stories, Benjamin Button and Valkyrie follow in the top spots.by Gitesh Pandya | December 28, 2008 |  CommentsThis weekend&nbsp;people were in the mood for movies over Christmas weekend as multiplexes were jam-packed with customers that powered four different new releases to more than $30M in ticket sales each over the long Thursday-to-Sunday holiday session. The Owen Wilson-Jennifer Aniston dog drama Marley &amp; Me led the way with a huge debut that exceeded expectations. Adam Sandler’s new family comedy Bedtime Stories and Brad Pitt’s period drama The Curious Case of Benjamin Button generated nearly identical numbers with the former winning the three-day period and the latter grossing more over the four-day span. Tom Cruise also showed some firepower with his war thriller Valkyrie which found a large audience too.North American ticket buyers had no problems spending ferociously as the Top 20 films hauled in a stunning $200M making for the second biggest weekend of 2008 after only the July 18-20 frame when The Dark Knight scored its record debut. This weekend’s explosive box office was even more impressive considering the fact that there were no sequels in the top ten at all. Instead, moviegoers spread their money across numerous star-driven films as everyone found something to their liking.[rtimage]MapID=1193744&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Soaring ahead of its competitors, Marley &amp; Me scored a powerful top spot debut grossing an estimated $37M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a sensational $51.7M since its Thursday launch. After several months of disappointments, Fox finally delivered a surefire smash averaging a sturdy $10,632 over three days from 3,480 locations. The studio began 2008 with hits like 27 Dresses, Jumper, and Horton Hears a Who but then stumbled with a handful of films that generated little excitement.Based on the best-selling book, the PG-rated Marley drew upon a built-in audience but the studio also marketed the film to dog lovers and families to pull in a wide range of business. Thursday saw a stellar $14.7M in sales which set a new record for Christmas Day openers beating the $10.2M of 2001’s Ali which translates to about $13M at today’s ticket prices. With kids off from school and a large number of adults having no work either, everyday this week will be like a Saturday at the box office so Marley could shatter the $100M mark by next weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1191988&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s comedy adventure Bedtime Stories, picked by many to be the top dog this weekend, settled into second with an estimated $28.1M in three days and $38.6M over its four-day Thursday-to-Sunday launch. The Adam Sandler family pic averaged an impressive $7,625 during three days and played to a broad audience. Studio data showed that 51% of the turnout was female and 52% was over 25 so all four quadrants were well represented. Bedtime basically targeted the same audience that powered Ben Stiller film Night at the Museum to a $42.2M four-day Christmas weekend launch two years ago. Reviews were dismal, but moviegoers responded instead to the starpower and effects-driven adventure of the PG-rated entry.[rtimage]MapID=1192085&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=12&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Brad Pitt attracted a sizable audience to his Oscar contender The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with an estimated $27M over the weekend and a stellar $39M over the four-day span. Paramount averaged a strong $9,036 from 2,988 theaters over three days with its PG-13 tale of a man who ages in reverse. Directed by David Fincher, Button co-stars Cate Blanchett and runs 2 hours and 47 minutes in length meaning most auditoriums were offering just four shows per day instead of five. Reviews have been very favorable and the film has scored five Golden Globe nominations. Many expect it to be a Best Picture candidate come Oscar night on February 22.Adult women made up the biggest sector of the audience for Brad. Females were 60% of the crowd while 70% were over 25. Button was not an easy sell for the studio and competition for mature adults was intense so the large opening truly underlines the drawing power of Shiloh’s dad. In fact its first day take of $12M marked the second biggest Christmas Day opening in history after Marley.Co-produced by Warner Bros. which will handle the film overseas, Button cost a whopping $150M to produce. But with Golden Globe awards and Academy Award nominations to be announced in January, the epic film should have long legs at the box office and may surpass that figure in domestic coin.[rtimage]MapID=1188309&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]MGM performed a Christmas miracle this weekend. The studio took what was long considered a surefire flop anchored by a star on the decline and turned it around and into a big hit. That film, Tom Cruise’s war drama Valkyrie, debuted in fourth place with an estimated $21.5M over the weekend and a terrific $30M since its Thursday launch. Invading 2,711 venues, the thriller about a plot to assassinate Hitler averaged a sturdy $7,942.Valkyrie‘s debut was in the same vicinity as other Cruise pics like Collateral ($24.7M opening) and The LastSamurai ($24.3M) although those films opened on Fridays during non-holiday frames.Valkyrie took advantage of a void in the marketplace and seized the opportunity. Emotional dramas like Marley and Button skewed female and Bedtime appealed more to kids leaving adult men with very few films to be excited about. Studio research showed that the PG-13 film pulled in an audience that was 55% male and 66% over 25. Backed by decent reviews, the World War II flick now has a shot at becoming yet another $100M hit for Cruise capping off a major comeback year for Suri’s old man who also delivered one of the summer’s most memorable performances with his Golden Globe-nominated turn in Tropic Thunder.[rtimage]MapID=1191436&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=48&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Following a less-than-spectacular opening last weekend, Jim Carrey’s comedy Yes Man dropped from first to fifth place with an estimated $16.5M. But the Warner Bros. release held up well dipping only 10% putting the ten-day cume at a solid $49.6M. A trip to the $100M club may still result for the A-list funnyman. Will Smith also saw a good hold for his latest venture. The do-gooder drama Seven Pounds slipped by 10% as well from its opening frame and grossed an estimated $13.4M pushing its ten-day tally to $39M for Sony.Universal’s animated film The Tale of Despereaux eased by just 7% and collected an estimated $9.4M for seventh place. The top ten’s only G-rated film has taken in $27.9M in ten days and has helped the studio reach a new company high with $1.1 billion in box office in 2008. Keanu Reeves followed with an estimated $7.9M for his sci-fi remake The Day the Earth Stood Still. Down 20%, the Fox release has pulled in $63.6M in 17 days.[rtimage]MapID=1188459&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=28&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Not all new releases clicked with moviegoers this holiday weekend. The one casualty was Lionsgate’s stylish actioner The Spirit which bowed to an estimated $6.5M over three days and $10.3M across four days. Playing in 2,509 locations, the PG-13 pic averaged a weak $2,593. Graphic novel king Frank Miller made his solo directing debut after co-helming the 2005 hit Sin City with Robert Rodriguez which opened much stronger with $29.1M over three days.Rounding out the top ten was Miramax’s Doubt which expanded nationally from 39 to 1,267 theaters and grossed an estimated $5.7M. Averaging a respectable $4,479, the Meryl Streep pic has taken in $8.8M thus far and has made the queen bee of actresses a major contender for the Oscar…again.[rtimage]MapID=1190978&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Everything has been going right for specialty distributors this holiday season as every major limited release has been met with sold out shows and strong averages. Two more new pics enjoyed solid bows this weekend. The much-hyped Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet reunion in Revolutionary Road led to the year’s best opening weekend average. Paramount Vantage took in an estimated $192,000 from only three sites for a robust $64,000 average and will expand nextweekend into the top 15 markets. Road has earned four Golden Globe nominations and has been well-liked by most critics.Overture got off to a nice start with its double Globe nominee Last Chance Harvey which bowed to an estimated $96,000 from six locations for a solid $16,000 average. The Dustin Hoffman-Emma Thompson pic has grossed $132,000 since debuting on Christmas Day.[rtimage]MapID=1198041&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=17&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Holdover pics in limited release scored some extra theaters and saw their weekend grosses climb. Fox Searchlight’s Slumdog Millionaire grossed an estimated $4.5M from 614 theaters for an impressive $7,248 average, up 46% from last weekend. The Clint Eastwood hit Gran Torino expanded from 19 to 84 sites and collected an estimated $2.4M for a powerful $29,048 average. Totals sit at$19.7M and $4.3M, respectively.Milk inched up 6% to an estimated $1.8M from 311 playdates for a $5,883 average. The Sean Penn starrer has grossed $13.6M for Focus. Parent company Universal used Christmas to widen its political drama Frost/Nixon from 39 to 205 locations and saw an estimated $1.5M in sales for a strong $7,180 average. Cume is $3.7M.The Weinstein Co. expanded the Kate Winslet flick The Reader into 116 houses and took in an estimated $671,000 for a $5,787 average. Mickey Rourke’s The Wrestler averaged a muscular $21,170 thanks to its estimated $381,000 from 18 arenas for Fox Searchlight.[rtimage]MapID=1195094&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=28&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Also notable below the top ten was the vampire blockbuster Twilight surpassing the total gross of fellow November hit Quantum of Solace. Just a month ago, nobody would have guessed that the modestly-budgeted $37M teen saga would go on to outgun the latest James Bond film and its $200M+ budget. Twilight grossed an estimated $4.5M this weekend, down only 13%, for a $167.1M domestic total while Quantum fell 29% to an estimated $1.5M pushing its cume to $164.3M. Overseas, of course, is another story with the 007 actioner having a $300M advantage, but Stephanie Meyer fans have given the film industry something that is rare nowadays – a hit with legs. For the year, Twilight ranks as the eighth biggest blockbuster of 2008.The top ten films grossed an estimated $172.9M which was up 9% from last year when National Treasure: Book of Secrets stayed in the top spot with $36.7M; and up 29% from 2006 when Night at the Museum remained at number one with $36.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"History, rotten, Oscars, Countdown","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Marley-Takes-1-The-Spirit-Tanks"},{"id":"47509142516698","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Audiences say Yes to Jim Carrey","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Audiences say Yes to Jim CarreyWill Smith's Seven Pounds less of a heavyweight than expected.by Gitesh Pandya | December 22, 2008 |  CommentsThis weekend moviegoers gave a clear yes to Jim Carrey and a definite maybe to Will Smith as the A-list Hollywood stars took the top two spots at the North American box office with their newest films. Carrey’s comedy Yes Man finished first, Smith’s odd drama Seven Pounds locked up the runnerup spot, while another new release – the animated mouse adventure The Tale of Despereaux – debuted in third place. Ticket sales were hurt by huge snowstorms and sub-freezing temperatures across much of the northeast. Add in the frenzy of the final shopping weekend before Christmas and it was clear that going to the movies was not a top priority this weekend with the top ten crashing by nearly 50% versus a year ago. Studios are hoping to pick up some of the lost business in the coming days when people leave work and school for the holidays.Warner Bros. claimed the top spot for the third time in four weeks with Yes Man which took in an estimated $18.2M from 3,434 theaters for a moderate $5,288 average. Carrey’s return to broad comedy opened below expectations, though it is difficult to say exactly how much weather and holiday shopping impacted the grosses. The funnyman’s last live-action comedy also bowed during the yuletide season. His 2005 pic Fun with Dick and Jane debuted on the Wednesday before the Santa holiday grossing $21.5M over the Friday-to-Monday holiday frame and $29.1M over six days. Comparisons would not be fair given the weak numbers of Christmas Eve and the stronger-than-usual sales on Christmas Day which affected its opening weekend. Dick went on to reach $110.3M.[rtimage]MapID=1191436&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=44&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Yes Man posted the smallest gross for a top spot debut in two months. The last six films to open at number one this year all debuted with more than $30M each. But the studio should see solid numbers in the days ahead as audiences become more available. Plus Yes is one of very few funny and feel-good films this holiday season that won’t make moviegoers cry by the end so that should make it stand out.Will Smith’s streak of eight consecutive number one openings came to an end with his latest film Seven Pounds which debuted in second place with an estimated $16M from 2,758 locations for a $5,801 average. The Sony release reunited the world’s biggest box office star with director Gabriele Muccino who enjoyed a much stronger $26.5M bow for their uplifting drama The Pursuit of Happyness which also debuted in mid-December. That film, however, had better reviews, a Golden Globe nomination for Smith, and strong word-of-mouth which allowed it to have good legs throughout the winter season on its way to a $162.6M final. Their latest collaboration drew an audience that was 55% female and 64% 25 or older.[rtimage]MapID=10009500&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Seven Pounds has attracted some of the worst reviews of the superstar’s career – not so much for his acting, but for the storyline. The $55M-budgeted film will still try to pick up more business over the next two weeks, but with five new wide releases hitting the multiplexes on Christmas Day, it may be an uphill battle. The last film for Smith to open lower was 2001’s Ali which grossed $14.7M on its opening weekend. However, that film debuted on Christmas Day which fell on a Tuesday so its gross in the first three days was $20M. Before that, Smith and a pre-Bourne Matt Damon starred in The Legend of Bagger Vance which bowed on a regular November weekend to $11.5M which would be $15M at today’s prices.Universal enjoyed a promising start to its kidpic offering for the holiday season The Tale of Despereaux which grossed an estimated $10.5M from 3,104 theaters for a $3,385 average. Ordinarily that would be a mild performance but with children getting out of school this week and parents having extra time off, every day between Christmas and New Year’s will be a virtual Saturday at the box office so the bulk of the business lies ahead. Studios often launch family films in mid-December to establish themselves in the marketplace before the holidays begin. Two years ago, Charlotte’s Web opened to $11.5M on its way to a $83M final (seven times its debut), 2000’s animated film The Emperor’s New Groove bowed to $9.8M leading to a $89.3M cume (nine times the debut), and the previous year’s mouse flick Stuart Little opened to $15M and ended with $140M (nine times its debut). The G-rated Tale benefited from little competition for its target audience this weekend and should be able to ride out the holiday season in style.[rtimage]MapID=1174282&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=30&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Following its top spot debut last weekend, The Day the Earth Stood Still came crumbling down in its second frame falling a steep 67% to an estimated $10.2M. After ten days, the Keanu Reeves sci-fi pic has amassed just $48.6M for Fox giving the studio yet another disappointment. Earth cost $80M to produce and was backed by a pricey marketing campaign. Word-of-mouth was poor which contributed to the big sophomore decline. The doomsday film will be looking for a holiday bonus in the coming weeks to help it finish with about $70M from North America.The Warner Bros. hit Four Christmases saw some competition from studio stablemate Yes Man and dropped by 41% in its fourth frame to an estimated $7.8M for a cume to date of $100.2M. Summit’s Twilight continued to show good legs thanks to repeat business from die-hard fans dipping 34% to an estimated $5.2M pushing the total to $158.5M. Of all films in the Top 20 showing a decline from last weekend, the vampire flick’s was the smallest.[rtimage]MapID=1195094&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=57&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Dropping 43% was Disney’s 3D toon Bolt which grossed an estimated $4.3M for a $95M sum to date. Fox Searchlight saw a strong national expansion for its awards contender Slumdog Millionaire which widened from 169 to 589 locations this weekend and jumped into the top ten in its sixth frame with an estimated $3.2M. The Danny Boyle-directed indie hit averaged $5,348 – second best in the top ten – and lifted its cume to $12.1M and counting.Fox’s expensive historical epic Australia continued to sink falling 44% to an estimated $2.3M while the 007 hit Quantum of Solace rounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.2M for Sony, down 42%. Totals are now $41.9M and $161.3M, respectively.Mickey Rourke’s critically-praised comeback film The Wrestler got off to the second best start of the year for a limited release opener. The Fox Searchlight pic platformed in four theaters and grossed an estimated $209,474 marking a scorching $52,369 average. Only Frost/Nixon debuted with a stronger average with its $60,236 from three theaters two weeks ago. Since its Wednesday launch, The Wrestler has taken in $295,000 and the film will slowly add more venues during each of the coming weekends.[rtimage]MapID=1202047&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A handful of acclaimed pics in limited release continued to shine ahead of their Christmas expansions. Miramax’s Meryl Streep-Philip Seymour Hoffman drama Doubt grossed an estimated $729,000 from 39 theaters for a strong $18,692 average. Total is $1.4M. Gran Torino from director/star Clint Eastwood averaged a stellar $24,632 with an estimated $468,000 from 19 sites for Warner Bros. The political drama Frost/Nixon remained in 39 locations and grossed an estimated $365,000, off 42%, for a $9,359 average.

Movies nabbing Oscar nominations saw their grosses jump, some more dramatically than others, with a handful using the opportunity to expand their runs nationwide. The overall North American box office remained robust and beat year-ago numbers for the fifth consecutive weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1203495&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=11&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Paul Blart cemented its position as the first blockbuster of 2009 with a relatively low decline in its sophomore frame dipping only 33% to an estimated $21.5M. That put the ten-day cume for the PG-rated laugher at a sensational $64.8M. With a slender $26M production cost, Mall Cop looks on track to find its way to at least $120M if not more, establishing James as a bankable leading man in the lucrative comedy genre. Sony has another PG-rated bumbling crime-fighter comedy coming in two weeks in the form of The Pink Panther 2 with Steve Martin.The Kate Beckinsale-less franchise flick Underworld: Rise of the Lycans enjoyed a solid debut in the runnerup spot with an estimated $20.7M from 2,942 sites for a healthy $7,036 average. The R-rated effects-driven prequel held up well for the third film in the series and the first without its primary star. Expectations were that without Beckinsale, Lycans would not match the openings of the past films which were $21.8M for 2003’s Underworld and $26.9M for 2006’s Underworld: Evolution. The third installment cost $35M to produce with adult men making up the primary audience segment. According to studio research, 59% of the crowd was male and 55% was over 25.[rtimage]MapID=1194220&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=12&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The last time one studio claimed the top two spots was over the November 16-18 frame in 2007 when Paramount had Beowulf opening on top and Bee Movie dropping a spot to second.Despite being shut out by the Clint-loving Academy, Gran Torino posted an impressive hold in its third weekend of wide release dipping 27% to an estimated $16M. That pushed the cume up to $97.6M putting the Warner Bros. release on course to cross the $100M mark by Thursday. Also dropping 27% and holding up quite well was the kidpic Hotel for Dogs which collected an estimated $12.4M for fourth place. Paramount’s total after 10 days is a commendable $37M.[rtimage]MapID=1197313&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=35&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Powered by its ten Oscar nominations, and nationwide expansion from 582 to 1,411 locations, Fox Searchlight’s Slumdog Millionaire surged 80% this weekend to an estimated $10.6M allowing the acclaimed pic to enter the top five for the first time in its eleven-week run. Winning the top prize from the Producers Guild of America on Saturday, the Danny Boyle-directed film also earned the highest per-theater average among all wide releases with a solid $7,477 per site. The total for the $14M-budgeted indie has climbed to $55.9M surpassing the $49M of big Fox’s awards hopeful Australia which cost a hefty $130M to produce.The horror flick My Bloody Valentine 3D tumbled 53% in its sophomore outing grossing an estimated $10.1M. With $37.7M scared up in ten days, the Lionsgate release should find its way to roughly $55M.Apparently moviegoers looking for a fantasy adventure about a man who brings stories to life by reading books got their fill last month from Adam Sandler. The similarly-themed Inkheart starring Brendan Fraser opened poorly in seventh place with an estimated $7.7M from 2,655 locations for a weak $2,910 average. The New Line production was released by Warner Bros. and earned lackluster reviews.[rtimage]MapID=1190728&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fox’s wedding comedy Bride Wars followed in eighth with an estimated $7M, off 40%, for a $48.7M cume to date. Brad Pitt’s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button scored the most Academy Award nominations of any film with 13 and enjoyed a modest bump in sales increasing 8% to an estimated $6M to raise the total to $111M. Since the Paramount release has been in wide release since its Christmas Day bow and no major expansion was done this weekend, the box office boost was not expected to be too large given that it has already reached a large audience over the past month. Button did, however, break the Top 20 chart of top-grossing releases from 2008 bumping Tropic Thunder off the list.Rounding out the top ten was the rap saga Notorious which crumbled 72% in its second weekend to an estimated $5.7M. The Fox Searchlight release pulled most of its audience out on the first weekend leaving little left for future frames. With $31.8M to date, a $35-40M final seems likely.With Oscar nominations announced on Thursday morning, several distributors pre-planned expansions for nominated films this weekend hoping to cash in on the extra publicity. Revolutionary Road, one of the major pics snubbed by the Academy with no nods in the top categories, widened from 171 to 1,058 and grossed an estimated $5.3M for a moderate $4,979 average. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, the Paramount Vantage release has taken in $11.9M and faces a tough road ahead without major Oscar ammo. Fox Searchlight’s The Wrestler expanded from 144 to 566 playdates and banked an estimated $3.7M for a solid $6,537 average. With a pair of acting nominations for Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei, the award-winning drama upped its total to $9.5M.[rtimage]MapID=1202047&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The three Best Picture nominees with the smallest odds of winning the big prize also saw grosses increase. Universal went nationwide with its political drama Frost/Nixon and took in an estimated $3M from 1,099 theaters for a mild $2,750 average. Securing five Oscar nominations, the Ron Howard-directed film has taken in $12M to date and isn’t generating too much moviegoer excitement. The Reader, which also scored five nods, climbed 10% this weekend to an estimated $1.4M for a $9.7M sum for The Weinstein Co. The Sean Penn film Milk rose 11% to an estimated $864,000 giving Focus $21.6M since its Thanksgiving release. The film bagged eight nominations from the Academy.The top ten films grossed an estimated $117.6M which was up 8% from last year when Meet the Spartans opened in the top spot with $18.5M; and up a strong 43% from 2006 when Epic Movie debuted at number one with $18.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Disney, streaming, Series, richard, children's","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Paul-Blart-Triumphs-Again"},{"id":"47509146298349","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Bat Still Going Strong, Three Weeks In","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Bat Still Going Strong, Three Weeks InMummy sequel a close second but the Swing Vote takes a diveby Gitesh Pandya | August 3, 2008 |  CommentsFan frenzy for the Caped Crusader kept the unstoppable juggernaut The Dark Knight in the number one spot for the third weekend in a row in North America narrowly beating the new adventure sequel The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor which settled for the silver medal. However on a global scale, the Mummy sequel won the gold with $102M worldwide beating out the Batman flick’s $81M. Meanwhile, Kevin Costner‘s latest offering Swing Vote was met with apathy as it bombed and landed in sixth place with a dismal performance.The Joker couldn’t stop stealing more cash. Warner Bros. enjoyed a superb hold for The Dark Knight which only dropped by 42% in its third outing to an estimated $43.8M. Averaging a still-muscular $10,267 per theater, the superhero sequel boosted its total to a jaw-dropping $394.9M in only 17 days and could now cross the $400M mark on Monday. The dark PG-13 actioner also broke into the top ten among all-time domestic blockbusters and now sits at number eight surpassing the $380.3M of 2005’s Star Wars Episode III.The new Batpic is holding up so well that it is now virtually guaranteed to smash the $500M barrier too. The road ahead should be promising as late summer megahits that truly please audiences tend to have low declines in August. 2006’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest witnessed a 44% drop in its third outing at number one and its 17-day cume of $321.9M represented 76% of its eventual final. Last summer’s The Bourne Ultimatum banked $164.7M by the end of its third session which accounted for 72% of its overall cume. At a similar pace, The Dark Knight would go on to approach the neighborhood of $520M for an astonishing box office run.Internationally, The Dark Knight grossed an estimated $37M from 51 markets to boost its stellar overseas tally to $202.5M. That gives the comic book flick a worldwide cume of $597.4M with much more fuel still in the tank as major markets like Korea, Japan, Spain, France, Russia, and Germany have yet to open.Opening close behind in second place was Universal’s historical adventure sequel The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor which grossed an estimated $42.5M. Invading 3,760 locations, the PG-13 film averaged a solid $11,303 per site. It was the smallest debut in the franchise’s history trailing the $43.4M of 1999’s The Mummy and the $68.1M of 2001’s The Mummy Returns. At today’s ticket prices, those two figures would translate to about $60M and $85M, respectively. Dragon, which finds Brendan Fraser returning to fight ancient evil in China, was expected by many to bow at number one. Its tally was slightly lower than anticipated while Dark Knight‘s legs were stronger than expected. Jet Li, Maria Bello, and Michelle Yeoh were newcomers to this installment. Studio research showed that males made up 52% of the audience while 56% were 25 and older. Reviews were mostly negative.Budgeted at $145M, Dragon Emperor got off to a potent start around the world where its release was strategically timed so the effects-driven actioner would hit the marketplace just a week ahead of the start of the Olympics in Beijing. Overseas, the film grossed $59.5M from 28 territories putting the global cume at a potent $102M. Universal is expecting to reach the vicinity of $375-400M in worldwide grosses. The previous two installments each collected $410-420M globally.Will Ferrell’s latest comedy Step Brothers posted a good second weekend grossing an estimated $16.3M ranking third for the frame. Off 47%, the R-rated Sony release has banked an impressive $63M in ten days and should find its way to $100-110M.Fans kept singing in their seats to Meryl Streep’s musical Mamma Mia! which slipped only 26% to an estimated $13.1M pushing the cume to $88M. The Universal hit is running ahead of last summer’s Hairspray and 2006’s Streep starrer The Devil Wears Prada which after their third weekends had grossed $78.9M and $83.5M, respectively. The ABBA songfest is proving to be a major crowdpleaser and a popular female-skewing alternative to the boy movies of summer.Another film with legs, the adventure story Journey to the Center of the Earth, also held up well despite the arrival of a competing Brendan Fraser actioner. The New Line pic grossed an estimated $6.9M, off just 29%, and lifted its sum to $73.1M. Breaking the $100M mark has now become a possibility for the 3D pic.Opening in sixth with a dismal debut was Kevin Costner’s political comedy Swing Vote with an estimated $6.3M from 2,213 venues. Averaging just $2,847 per site, the PG-13 film was backed with little marketing support and failed to excite the voting public. Costner invested over $20M of his own money to help finance the flop which Buena Vista distributed.A pair of hits from the double century club followed. Will Smith’s Hancock dropped 37% to an estimated $5.2M and saw its cume climb to $216M for Sony. Disney’s WALL•E dipped a mere 26% to an estimated $4.7M for a $204.2M total to date. It broke through the $200M mark on Friday and should edge past Kung Fu Panda in another week or two to become 2008’s top-grossing toon.Fox rounded out the top ten with two films that few are seeing. The sci-fi sequel The X-Files: I Want to Believe collapsed in its sophomore frame tumbling 66% to an estimated $3.4M. After ten days, the $30M pic has grossed only $17.1M and should end up with only $22-25M. The animated comedy Space Chimps slipped 37% to an estimated $2.8M for a cume of $22.1M. The X-Files team must be embarrassed by the fact that its film is being outgrossed by Space Chimps.The top ten films grossed an estimated $145.1M which was down 8% from last year when The Bourne Ultimatum opened in the top spot with $69.3M; but up 25% from 2006 when Talladega Nights debuted at number one with $47M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"emmy, high, Toys, Acorn, Legendary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Bat-Still-Going-Strong-Three-Weeks-In"},{"id":"47509144339425","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: HSM3 Soars to Dazzling $42M Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: HSM3 Soars to Dazzling $42M OpeningJigsaw defeated by young singing whippersnappers.by Gitesh Pandya | October 26, 2008 |  CommentsRecession be damned!

The studio developed the brand onthe Disney Channel with two made-for-television movies that became pop culturebehemoths and took a leap with the third installment by having it graduate tothe big screen where Mouse House execs hoped the fans would follow it to. Andfollow they did.&nbsp;The fan base turned out in droves on Friday with a stellar $16.9M. Sales fell by9% to $15.3M on Saturday indicating how intense demand was to see HSM3 onthe first day. Online ticketing sites reported brisk advance sales for weeks.Disney is estimating a Sunday drop of 36% to $9.8M. With a reported budget ofonly $13M, the Wildcats tale is well on its way to becoming a cash cowespecially when international box office and home video sales are bundled in.The franchise is made for repeat viewing which may not happen much at the boxoffice given ticket prices for each sitting, but should surely be a factor onDVD where young fans can watch Zac Efron and crew over and over again. Musicalstypically sell well overseas and even an all-American one like Senior Yearalready has a global fan base waiting to drop some Euros and Yen. Over theweekend, international ticket buyers in 22 markets spent an estimated $40Mgiving Musical a global debut of $82M with much more to go.For the first time since the last presidential election season, a Sawfilm did not open at number one on the weekend before Halloween. Instead, thelatest chapter in the wildly successful franchise Saw Vsettled for the runnerup spot but proved that the series is still alive and wellthe fifth time around with an estimated $30.5M in ticket sales this weekend.Averaging a brutal $9,965 from 3,060 sites, the R-rated torturefest dipped onlya scant amount from debuts of its recent predecessors. The last four Saw filmshave bowed in the $30-34M range and are all among the top ten October openingsof all-time.

Disney’s heavily-hypedfantasy sequel The Chronicles ofNarnia: Prince Caspian seized control of the box office throne, butattracted far less business than expected and even fell short of matching itspredecessor’s bow. Iron Mancontinued to show off its super strength and finished in second place shatteringthe $200M barrier in the process. Overall, the box office slumped to the worstperformance in seven years for the usually-potent weekend before the MemorialDay holiday frame.Landing in first place was Prince Caspian with an estimated $56.6M from 3,929 locations for astrong $14,399 average. Though good enough for first place, the PG-ratedadventure tale posted a debut that was 14% weaker than the $65.6M opening of thefirst installment in the franchise, The Lion, The Witch, and Wardrobe, which launched in December 2005.Factor in today’s higher multiplex prices and the new Narnia sold about20% fewer tickets despite playing in 313 more theaters.With a massive Disney marketing push and no other new releases this weekend tosteal away business, Prince was expected to flex much more muscle.Reviews were generally good and the built-in audience was huge considering Lion went on to gross $291.7M from North America and nearly $750M worldwide.Studio research showed that audiences were split evenly between males andfemales while 52% were age 25 or older, so it did play to a broad crowd. Caspian began its journey on Friday with $19.3M, inched up 5% on Saturday to$20.3M, and was projected to slide by a slender 16% on Sunday to $17M. Finalnumbers will be released on Monday once Sunday sales are fully tabulated.Most industry forecasts before the film’s release saw the opening landing in the$75-85M range given the strength of the initial Narnia. But the massiveaudiences that turned out for the first film may have been driven more by TheLion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe than by The Chronicles of Narnia.Moviegoers may have been more excited by that particular story than by thefranchise in general making Prince Caspian an installment that generated lessenthusiasm. Lion had Biblical parallels that were key in bringing outChristian moviegoers. Caspian did not seem to retain a large share ofthat crowd hence the smaller numbers.Disney is moving ahead with its next Narnia tale The Voyage of the Dawn Treader which currently is slated for release onMay 7, 2010. But with Marvel Studios recently planting its flag one weekendearlier on April 30 for Iron Man 2,it would not be surprising if Dawn Treader’s date were to change as thesophomore frame of the super hero sequel will undoubtedly be gargantuan and atough act to fight.In its third weekend, Iron Manremained a formidable contender and grossed an estimated $31.2M slipping only39%. That makes for a fantastic hold for a super hero film facing a neweffects-driven action sequel. After 17 days, the Paramount juggernaut hasboosted its tally to an amazing $222.5M. Iron Man beat out the third-weekenddeclines of most other summer super hero movies that were non-sequels or rebootssuch as Batman Begins (43%), Superman Returns (44%), FantasticFour (45%), X-Men (46%), and The Hulk (56%). The metal maneven came close to the incredible 37% decline that the first Spider-Manenjoyed in its third frame in May 2002. Iron Man also delivered the bestthird-weekend gross of any film since Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’sChest‘s $35.2M in July 2006.Looking at other tentpole pics opening on the first weekend of May, thegranddaddy of them all is Spider-Man which grossed $285.6M in its first 17 daysrepresenting 71% of its final tally of $403.7M. 2003’s X2: X-Men Unitedand 2001’s The Mummy Returns captured 81% and 72% of the overall totalsrespectively in the first 17 days. Iron Man is not depreciating asquickly as the X-Men sequel did five years ago so its trajectory shouldbe more in line with those of the first webslinger pic and the Brendan Frasersequel. On that course, Iron Man has a legitimate shot at reaching the$300M mark.Roughly 30 million moviegoers have now seen Iron Man which bodes well forParamount’s other big summer offering Indiana Jones and theKingdom of the Crystal Skull which had its trailer attached to the comicbook behemoth. That film opens this Wednesday night at 12:01 a.m. ahead of thelong Memorial Day holiday weekend and is arguably the year’s most anticipatedfilm. Paramount could conceivably become the first studio in history to generatetwo $300M+ summer blockbusters two years in a row.Dropping a spot to third place was theCameron Diaz and Ashton Kutchercomedy What Happens in Vegaswith an estimated $13.9M in its second weekend. The Fox hit is the top choicefor moviegoers not interested in action and special effects. It enjoyed a stronghold and dipped only 31%. Cume sits at a solid $40.3M in ten days. With itssturdy legs and a major holiday frame coming up, the $35M-budgeted film could goon to reach $75-80M domestically. Vegas will become Diaz’s top-grossinglive-action comedy since 1998’s surprise hit There’s Something About Mary.Tumbling 59% in its second weekend was the summer box office’s first majorcasualty Speed Racerwhich collected just $7.6M, according to estimates. The Warner Bros. release hasbanked a mere $29.8M in ten days and is decelerating at the turnstiles. With areported budget in between $120M and $160M, the colorful Wachowski Brothersflick looks to limp to a $40-45M finish from North America. Overseas audiencesare not feeling the excitement either so it will be difficult to salvage theenormous costs. Internationally the Mach 5 took in a measly $7M from 39countries this weekend for a puny $24.4M cume.The spring comedy quartet followed. Baby Mamaeased by a mere 26% to an estimated $4.6M giving Universal a sturdy $47.3M.Sony’s Made of Honorfell 45% to an estimated $4.5M boosting its total to $33.7M.Universal’s R-rated offering Forgetting Sarah Marshallslipped by only 34% and took in an estimated $2.5M for a $55.1M total. NewLine’s stoner sequel Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Baygrossed an estimated $1.8M, down 42%, for a $33.9M sum.Lionsgate captured an estimated $1M for itsJackie Chan and Jet Liactioner The Forbidden Kingdomwhich dropped 54%. Cume is $50.3M. Indie sensation The Visitorhas been slowly building its audience over the last five weeks and was rewardedwith a spot in the top ten. The Overture release played in only 224 sites in itssixth frame and grossed an estimated $687,000 for a respectable $3,067 average.In roughly the same number of theaters as last weekend, Visitor dipped bya scant 6% and its total is now $3.4M and counting.Opening with impressive results in limited release was Miramax’s award-winningNorwegian film Reprisewhich took in an estimated $47,100 from only three houses for a potent $15,700average. Overwhelmingly praised by critics, the R-rated film expands to moremarkets over the holiday weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $124.4M which was down 27% from lastyear when Shrek the Third opened in the top spot with $121.6M; and down19% from 2006 when The Da Vinci Cod debuted at number one with $77.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, boxofficeguru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"SDCC, See, medical, dceu, cinematic, Network, Peacock, movie, color","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Caspian-More-Prince-Than-King"},{"id":"47509146305521","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hancock shows some attitude at the box office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hancock shows some attitude at the box officeHancock soars while the robot juggernaut slows.by Gitesh Pandya | July 6, 2008 |  CommentsWill Smith took home yet another gold medal at the box office with his superhero-with-an-attitude actioner Hancock which opened at number one over the Fourth of July holiday weekend nearly doubling the gross of the frame’s silver medalist. Sony’s critically-panned title collected an estimated $66M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a solid $107.3M since its launch on Tuesday night with previews beginning at 7pm. The three-day average was a strong $16,646 from 3,965 locations.Its five-and-a-half-day tally was the fourth biggest opening for the extended Independence Day holiday frame trailing 2004’s Spider-Man 2 ($180.1M in six days), last year’s Transformers ($155.4M in six-and-a-half days), and 2005’s War of the Worlds ($112.7M in six days). Since the holiday falls on a different day each year prompting studios to bow their films in various ways, comparisons are not always fair. But in all three cases, the extended openings accounted for 48-49% of the eventual final domestic gross.Smith once again proved that he’s Hollywood’s most bankable box office draw. Hancock was the actor’s eighth consecutive number one opener, eighth consecutive film to break the $100M mark, and gave the actor his seventh consecutive year of having a film reach the nine-digit mark. Co-starring Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron, Hancock offers up a new take on the superhero story with a central character that drinks, curses, and roughs up children. The PG-13 film cost a reported $150M and Smith served as producer as well as star. Reviews were overwhelmingly negative but audiences came out anyway generating sales that were far from a record, but still very healthy nonetheless. Bad buzz could make the weeks ahead rocky though.Hancock‘s journey began on Tuesday night with $6.8M, Wednesday’s official opening day delivered $17.4M, and Thursday added in $17.1M more. The Fourth of July holiday fell on a Friday this year and saw Hancock take in $18.8M. Saturday climbed 39% to $26.1M while Sunday was estimated to dip by 19% to $21.2M. Sony launched the tentpole pic around the world this weekend and hauled in an additional $78M overseas bringing the global opening to a stellar $185.3M over the past week.Following its top spot debut last week, Disney/Pixar’s animated hit WALL•E fell 47% to second with an estimated $33.4M giving the G-rated toon a sturdy $128.1M in ten days. It was a larger than usual decline for a Pixar pic but the Fourth of July holiday falling on a Friday contributed to the slide. The robot adventure opened 34% higher than last summer’s Ratatouille which debuted at the same time, but after ten days the lead was cut in half to 17%. Both periods include the Independence Day holiday.But thanks to strong midweek sales at a time when kids are out of school, WALL•E‘s ten-day cume is 10% ahead of Cars and 9% ahead of Kung Fu Panda. Both of those animated hits opened in early June. The road ahead will not be an easy one as two more PG-rated family films open this Friday – the Brendan Fraser adventure film Journey to the Center of the Earth and the Eddie Murphy comedy Meet Dave. At its current pace, WALL•E could find its way to $235-245M domestically.Universal’s effects-driven actioner Wanted fell a steep 60% in its second weekend to an estimated $20.6M and boosted its ten-day total to $90.8M. The $75M Angelina Jolie assassin pic should find its way to $130-140M from North America making it the second biggest R-rated film of the year after Sex and the City. Overseas, Wanted grossed an estimated $18.8M from 23 markets pushing the international total to $64.2M and the global gross to $155M so far.Steve Carell‘s Get Smart landed in fourth in its third frame with an estimated $11.1M. Off 45%, the Warner Bros.release has collected $98.1M in 17 days. Paramount’s animated hit Kung Fu Panda followed in fifth with an estimated $7.5M, off 36%, lifting the total to $193.4M. Currently the third largest film of 2008, the DreamWorks production looks to end up with about $220M and could have its toon crown swiped by WALL•E later this summer.Universal’s comic reboot The Incredible Hulk fell 48% to an estimated $5M and brought its sum to $124.9M which was almost identical to the $124.7M that 2003’s Hulk took in at the same point in its run. The new pic opened lower but has enjoyed somewhat better legs. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull followed with an estimated $3.9M, down only 24%, for a new cume of $306.6M. That puts the Steven Spielberg sequel at number 26 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters ahead of the $306.2M of 1996’s Independence Day. Of course, ticket prices were much higher a dozen years ago when Will Smith scored his first of five number one openers over this holiday and its tally today would be roughly $490M.Abigail Breslin landed in eighth place with her Depression-era pic Kit Kittredge: An American Girl which disappointed in wide release grossing only $3.6M, according to estimates, in its first weekend of national play. Expanding from five to 1,843 locations, the G-rated pic aimed at young girls averaged a poor $1,954 per theater. Given the popularity of the books and toys that the film is based on and the sizzling numbers posted in limited release, a much stronger turnout was expected. Total sits at just $6.1M for Picturehouse.Comedies rounded out the top ten with Sex and the City grossing an estimated $2.3M and You Don’t Mess With the Zohan taking in an estimated $2M. Totals stand at $144.9M and $94.8M, respectively.Two critically-panned films fell from the top ten this weekend. The Mike Myers comedy The Love Guru tumbled 68% to an estimated $1.7M for a weak cume of $29.3M. Budgeted at $60M, the Paramount release should finish with only $31-33M. Fox’s M. Night Shyamalan thriller The Happening declined by 63% to an estimated $1.5M for a $62.1M total. Produced for about $55M, the R-rated pic should end up with around $65M which is a nice bounce back after the director’s Lady in the Water which grossed $42.3M in 2006. But The Happening stills ranks as the second lowest performer for Shyamalan since he became a household name in 1999 with The Sixth Sense.The top ten films grossed an estimated $155.5M which was off 3% from last year when Transformers opened in the top spot with $70.5M over three days; but up 12% from 2006’s holiday frame when Superman Returns debuted at number one with $52.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Dates","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hancock-shows-some-attitude-at-the-box-office"},{"id":"47509146322937","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Iron Man Soars to Eye-Popping $104M Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Iron Man Soars to Eye-Popping $104M DebutMarvel holds audiences in an Iron grip.by Gitesh Pandya | May 4, 2008 |  CommentsParamount Pictures and its baby mama Marvel Studios were the proud parents ofan explosive new movie franchise as the super hero film Iron Manblasted off to jaw-dropping ticket sales around the world officially kicking offthe summer blockbuster season. The comic book actioner led the overall boxoffice to its biggest weekend of the year and accounted for two-thirds of allbusiness in the top ten. Opening in second with commendable numbers was thewedding-themed romantic comedy Madeof Honor which gave women not interested in flying metal men somethingto see. Following a dismal spring season, the summer got started with a bang.Iron Man crushedits competitors this weekend with a stunning estimate of $100.8M in ticket salesover the Friday-to-Sunday period delivering the tenth largest opening ofall-time and the second highest ever for a non-sequel after the $114.8M of2002’s Marvel Comics sibling Spider-Man.The Robert Downey Jr.flick began its run on Thursday at 8pm with advance showtimes grossing $3.5M inthe four-hour period ending at midnight, the official start of Friday. Thatamounted to a gargantuan $104.3M in just over three days easily outdistancingindustry expectations which were in the $70-90M range. Co-starringJeff Bridges,Terrence Howard,andGwyneth Paltrow,theJon Favreau-directedblockbuster averaged a stellar $24,543 from a saturation release in 4,105theaters.Overseas, Iron Man invaded 57 territories and made off with a terrific$96.8M putting the global launch at a humongous $201M since the firstinternational openings on Wednesday.In North America, Friday took off with a massive $35.1M in grosses (includingshows beginning at midnight on Thursday night). Sales inched up 7% on Saturdayto $37.5M which was impressive since many super hero films see their numbersdecline on Saturday. The studio is estimating a Sunday drop of only 25% to$28.1M. Audience research showed that an understandable 65% were male while 55%were over 25. Reports on Iron Man‘s production cost have varied from$140M to $180M, but the negative cost should be easily recouped given thetremendous response worldwide.In the Marvel stable, only its crown jewel Spider-Man has seen a betterfranchise debut with the first film’s opening amounting to roughly $140M attoday’s ticket prices. Adjusting for 2008 prices, opening weekends for otherfirst installments from the comic giant would be approximately $71M for 2000’sX-Men, $73M for 2003’s The Hulk, and $62M for 2005’s FantasticFour. Iron Man’s opening zoomed a good $30-40M higher.Most were not expecting a nine-digit debut from the Tony Stark pic since theIron Man character is not as well-known as other super heroes like Spider-Man,Batman, or even The Hulk. But a massive marketing push, overwhelmingly positivereviews, and a release on the first weekend of May when no other event filmswere out helped it to dominate the attention of movie fans everywhere. ForParamount it was the second largest debut in company history trailing only the$121.6M of last May’s animated sequel Shrek the Third that it releasedfor DreamWorks. The studio’s previous high for a live-action film was with lastJuly’s Transformers (another DreamWorks winner) which opened to aFriday-to-Sunday score of $70.5M after a mid-week bow.Iron Man‘s success also comes as good news to Marvel since this is itsfirst fully financed and produced picture as part of its new arrangement whereit will retain more of the risks and rewards for its future super hero flicks.It would be shocking not to see at least two sequels come out of this franchiseso the profits will flow for years to come.Most multiplexes played Iron Man on multiple screens in order to fulfillintense demand, however Paramount did not report the total number of prints inthe marketplace. Looking at recent May behemoths, Spider-Man 3 and 2005’sStar Wars Episode III opened with 10,000 and 9,400 prints respectively.It would not be surprising if Iron Man seized control of more than 9,000total screens as well this weekend.Despite absorbing so much demand upfront, Iron Man boasts indicators thatit could have decent legs. Critics have poured on the praise leading to astaggering 94% score on RottenTomatoes.com which is the best of any wide releasethis year and tops among all super hero flicks ever. Plus exit polls taken thisweekend by CinemaScore have delivered a fantastic A grade making the metal guyone of those rare action movies to be a winner with both critics and ticketbuyers alike. Last year Spider-Man 3 met with lukewarm word-of-mouthafter its record bow which accounted for a whopping 45% of its eventual finaldomestic haul of $336.5M. Opening weekend percentages for other high profileopeners from the start of May include 28% for Spider-Man, 34% for 2001’sThe Mummy Returns, and 40% for X2: X-Men United. Given Iron Man‘sstrong buzz and the calendar ahead, a final domestic tally of $250M is certainlywithin reach.Thanks to Iron Man, eight of the top ten opening weekends of all-timehave come from the lucrative month of May. The explosive launch of the Stark picwill be good for the entire industry since millions of moviegoers this weekendgot to see trailers for upcoming summer films and may be getting back into thehabit of visiting their local multiplexes.Patrick Dempsey,who like Robert Downey Jr. began his career as a teen hunk in the 1980s, foundhimself one step behind the guest of honor with his new romantic comedy Madeof Honor which grossed an estimated $15.5M during its opening weekend.The PG-13 film about a man who falls for his recently-engaged female best friendaveraged a solid $5,680 from 2,729 locations. Sony positioned thecritically-panned offering as a counter-programming choice against Iron Manfor women uninterested in comic book antics. Not surprisingly, females made up68% of the crowd according to studio research while 62% were over the age of 25.The Grey’s Anatomy star’s new film carried a budget of just under $40MDespite new competition from a tentpole juggernaut and a hit romantic comedy,the Universal laugher Baby Mama held up verywell in its second weekend dropping 41% to an estimated $10.3M. With a solid$32.3M in ten days, the Tina Fey-Amy Poehler pic looks set to find its way toaround $55M.The studio claimed the fourth slot too with its other female-skewing comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshallwhich fell a moderate 44% to an estimated $6.1M lifting the cume to $44.8Mmaking it the top-grossing picture of the year for Universal. The studio hasstruggled in 2008 and ranks dead last in marketshare among the big six studios,but hopes to turn things around this summer with big-budget action entries likeThe Incredible Hulk, Angelina’s Jolie’s Wanted, and The Mummy:Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.Audiences have been very kind to female-skewing comedies in recent weeks with Made, Baby, and Sarah all connecting with moviegoers andopening to $15-18M each. The marketplace has expanded to accommodate all threeand an additional test will come next weekend when yet another player, Fox’s What Happens in Vegas starring Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz, debutsnationwide. It boasts the most starpower of the foursome, but also looks theleast funny.New Line’s guy comedyHarold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bayfell sharply in its second weekend and ranked fifth with an estimated $6M. Down60%, the $12M sequel has grossed $25.3M in ten days and should reach theneighborhood of $35M by the end of its run. That would double the $18.2M that Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle smoked up in 2004.Jackie Chanand Jet Li gotpummeled by the man of iron as their martial arts adventure film The Forbidden Kingdomtumbled 63% to an estimated $4.2M boosting the cume to a solid $45.1M forLionsgate and The Weinstein Co. Fox’s kidpic Nim’s Islanddropped a moderate 40% to an estimated $2.8M and lifted its total to $42.5M.A trio of Sony releases followed. The teen thriller Prom Nightdipped by 45% to an estimated $2.5M giving the studio $41.4M to date. Thepopular blackjack drama 21 took in an estimated $2.1M, off 48%, andincreased its winnings to a stellar $79.1M. It is the eighth film released thisyear to break the $75M mark which is the same amount at this point last year.Rounding out the top ten was the Al Pacino misfire 88 Minuteswhich dropped 56% to an estimated $1.6M giving Sony a miserable $15.4M thus far.Two new releases enjoyed solid debuts in limited release. David Mamet’s martialarts drama Redbeltbowed to an estimated $69,000 from six locations for a $11,441 average. TheR-rated film stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tim Allen. Paramount Vantage generatedan average almost as good with its British comedy Son of Rambowwhich debuted in five houses with an estimated $53,000 for $10,510 per site. Thefilm festival darling will expand to 30 theaters in a dozen additional marketsthis Friday.Fox saw two films on the opposite ends of the box office spectrum drop out ofthe top ten this weekend. The Dr. Seuss toon Horton Hears a Whogrossed an estimated $1.4M, down 46%, for a robust cume to date of $149.8M.Still the top-grossing film of the year for a few more days, the G-rated comedyreuniting the dream team of Jim Carrey and Steve Carell should finish its runwith $152-154M. Later this week, Horton will become Carrey’s fifth film to breakthe $150M domestic mark.The studio’s crime thriller Deceptionhas been completely ignored by moviegoers and crumbled 63% in its second weekendto an estimated $865,000 and embarrassing $432 average. With only $4M taken inthus far, a puny $5-6M final seems likely.The top ten films grossed an estimated $151.9M which was down 15% from last yearwhen Spider-Man 3 opened to a record $151.1M; but up 62% from 2006 whenMission: Impossible III debuted at number one with $47.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"comedies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Iron-Man-Soars-to-EyePopping-104M-Debut"},{"id":"47509146312692","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Panda and Zohan Rock June B.O.","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Panda and Zohan Rock June B.O.Black and white power rules the weekend.by Gitesh Pandya | June 8, 2008 |  CommentsAir-conditioned multiplexes were the place to be as the new comedies Kung Fu Pandaand You Don’t Mess With The Zohangenerated sparkling debuts attracting a combined $100M in opening weekend ticketsales powering the marketplace to the second biggest June weekend in box officehistory. Add in popular holdovers and four different movies managed weekendgrosses of more than $20M. It was the first time since last July that this hasoccurred. Overall it was the strongest weekend at the box office in ten monthsand gave June a sensational start.Gobbling up the most business and winning the weekend by a wide margin, Kung Fu Pandatopped the charts with an estimated $60M in its opening weekend. Produced byDreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount, the PG-rated comedy averageda scorching $14,584 from 4,114 theaters. It was the third best opening ever fora DreamWorks toon after only Shrek the Third and Shrek 2 whichbowed to $121.6M and $108M, respectively. If the estimate holds, Panda will rankas the fourth largest opening in June after Harry Potter and the Prisoner ofAzkaban ($93.7M), The Hulk ($62.1M), and Cars ($60.1M).Panda is anchored by the comedic stylings ofJack Black andfeatures supporting voice roles by Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, Ian McShane, and Jackie Chan.The animated film took advantage of a perfect competitive environment as therewas built-up hunger from the family audience since parents have had no excitingfilms to take their younger children to for two months now. The road ahead alsolooks bright as Panda will not face any major competition for kids for threeweeks when rival Pixar hits the big screen with Wall-E on June 27. Pluswith school children about to go on their summer breaks from class, demand wasthere for a funny and entertaining film.The debut was the sixth biggest for a non-sequel animated film after TheSimpsons Movie ($74M), The Incredibles ($70.5M), Finding Nemo($70.3M), Monsters, Inc. ($62.6M), and Cars. Reviews were strongand early word-of-mouth has been solid. Plus with more schools closing eachcoming week, midweek numbers will become sturdy helping to fatten up Panda’sbelly. It could very well become Paramount’s third consecutive release totop the $200M mark following Iron Man and Indiana Jones and theKingdom of the Crystal Skull. For 2008, Panda also ranks as the thirdbiggest opener of the year after those two studio siblings. A combined domestichaul of $800-900M may result from the trio with the global tally hitting ajaw-dropping $2 billion.Paramount reported an opening day tally of $20.3M on Friday followed by a modest11% bump on Saturday to $22.5M, and an estimated 24% decline on Sunday to$17.2M. Kung Fu Panda successfully brought out the non-family audiencetoo which helped it score a potent Friday. Studio exit polls showed that 55% ofthe crowd was female and 51% was 25 or older.Coming in second for the weekend was Adam Sandlerwith his new comedy You Don’t Mess With The Zohanwhich proved that fans will line up to see him in just about anything. The Sonyrelease bowed to an estimated $40M from 3,462 locations for a potent $11,554average. If the estimate stands, it will be the comedian’s fifth opening at orabove the $40M mark joining The Longest Yard ($47.6M), AngerManagement ($42.2M), Big Daddy ($41.5M), and Click ($40M). Itis also his eighth debut above the $35M mark. The PG-13 vehicle finds Sandlerplaying a decorated Israeli soldier who escapes to New York to become ahairdresser. Reviews were about as negative as those for his other broadcomedies.According to studio research, the audience for Zohan was evenly splitwith females making up 51% and those over 25 also representing 51%. For Sony itwas the studio’s biggest opening in more than a year. Not since it smashed theall-time record in May 2007 with Spider-Man 3‘s $151.1M bow has itreached the $40M level on any film’s opening weekend.Sandler has been the most consistent comedy draw at the box office this decadeand his latest venture stands an excellent chance of giving the A-lister hisseventh consecutive year of having a $100M+ grosser. Will Smith hopes to extendhis streak to seven as well next month with Sony stablemate Hancockopening on July 2. The only other star to match this feat in recent times wasTom Cruise who starred in $100M+ blockbusters each year from 2000-2006.Down one notch from last weekend was the adventure sequel Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skullwhich brought in an estimated $22.8M in treasure. Off a reasonable 49%, theParamount release upped its 18-day cume to a stunning $253M and climbed up tonumber 43 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters after Monsters, Inc.which grossed $255.9M in 2001. Crystal Skull knocked 1981’s Raiders of the LostArk off the all-time Top 50 list, however ticket prices were much lower backthen and the new Indy is not likely to sell as many tickets as Raiders did.The new Harrison Ford saga looks to find its way to roughly $310M domesticallyat its current trajectory as it continues to chart the same course as lastyear’s Memorial Day weekend opener Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End. Inits third frame, the Johnny Depp sequel dropped 52% to $21.1M pushing the17.5-day cume to a remarkably similar $253.4M on its way to a $309.4Mconclusion.Stumbling 63% in its second frame was last weekend’s surprise chart-topper Sex and the Citywith an estimated $21.3M. Despite the heavy fall, the R-rated film still posteda remarkable gross and boosted its ten-day cume to an amazing $99.3M. The hugedrop was expected given the size of last weekend’s launch which was led by amassive rush on opening day. Saturday sales last week took a 34% nosedive fromFriday indicating that the sophomore session would also see a sharp decline.Originally developed at New Line, Sex is now the highest grossing movieof the year for Warner Bros. which recently took over releasing duties for thedismantled mini-studio. Warners does have two promising titles coming up thissummer with this month’s Get Smart and next month’s heavily-anticipated The DarkKnight.

With a reported cost of $120M, the PG-rated racing picfailed to spark interest with the targeted family audience or even with fans ofthe classic anime series.

Jacksonduke it out sending their new science fiction actioner Jumperto number one over the Presidents’ Day holiday weekend. The dance drama Step Up 2 The Streetsdebuted in second place while the fantasy adventure The Spiderwick Chroniclespremiered in third. For the first time ever, three films opened to more than$15M each over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the Presidents’ Day holidayframe.Landing in the number one spot, Fox’s sci-fi action entry Jumpereasily led the field opening to an estimated $27.2M over three days. Playing in3,428 theaters, the PG-13 pic averaged a muscular $7,942 and has taken in $33.9Msince its Thursday launch. The Christensen-Jackson film met with horriblereviews from critics, but audiences didn’t care and instead responded to theslick marketing campaign. Including the Monday holiday, the $85M pic should bankjust under $40M in its first five days of release.Buena Vista swiped the second place spot with its dance sequel Step Up 2 The Streetswhich opened with an impressive $19.7M over three days from 2,470 sites. ThePG-13 teen tale played in about 1,000 fewer theaters than Jumper butgenerated a similar average of $7,962. Since debuting on Valentine’s Day,Streets has grossed $26.3M. According to studio research, young women led theway with 60% of the crowd being female and 65% being under the age of 25.Although it had a different release pattern, the sequel’s opening basicallymatched the $20.7M bow of 2006’s Step Upwhich was a summer title and featured a different cast. Rather than relying onstarpower, Buena Vista focused on keeping the music and dancing as updated aspossible with a marketing campaign that made full use of the hit song \"Low\" fromFlo Rida which has been the nation’s number one song for the last eightconsecutive weeks. Look for the studio to continue to develop the Step Upbrand just like Universal did with its Bring It On property whichcontinues to spawn lucrative direct-to-DVD titles.Close behind in third was the effects-heavy fantasy pic The Spiderwick Chronicleswith an estimated $19.1M from 3,847 theaters for a solid $4,960 average.Paramount’s PG-rated adventure has grossed $21.5M since its Thursday debut andis expected to reach $24.4M by the end of the holiday weekend on Monday. Aimedat family audiences, Spiderwick should continue to have its targetdemographic all to itself over the next two weeks when many schools take theirwinter breaks as no other kidpics will open. Critics gave a very positiveresponse. The Friday-to-Sunday tally was just a bit behind the $22.6M bow oflast year’s kids fantasy pic Bridge to Terabithiawhich debuted over the same holiday frame before finding its way to $82.3M.The critically-panned adventure comedy Fool’s Goldheld up reasonably well after its number one debut last week. Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudsonwitnessed a drop of 39% to an estimated $13.1M pushing the ten-day tally to asturdy $42M. Budgeted at $70M, the Warner Bros. flick should find its way to$70-75M domestically.Opening in fifth with the smallest debut among the frame’s four new releaseswas the romantic comedy Definitely, Maybewith an estimated $9.7M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and $12.8M since itsThursday bow. Playing in 2,204 locations, the PG-13 pic averaged a moderate$4,394 over three days. Adult women made up the primary audience as 67% of thecrowd was female and 54% was over 30. The $24M film earned generally goodreviews from critics.The holiday weekend’s four new releases grossed a combined $75.7M over theFriday-to-Sunday session and $94.4M since Thursday. This year marked the firsttime that every new wide release opened on the Thursday Valentine’s Day holidayto get an early jump on the Presidents’ Day holiday weekend.Falling from second to sixth wasMartin Lawrence‘s comedyWelcome Home Roscoe Jenkins&nbsp;with an estimated $8.9M, down 45%, for a ten-day cume of $29.1M. The $35MUniversal release should end up with roughly $50M. Fox Searchlight’s indiecomedy Junofollowed with an estimated $4.6M, off a mere 17%, giving the Oscar-nominated pica stellar $124.1M to date. The Ellen Page hit has now spent nine consecutiveweeks in the top ten, the most for any film since last April’s Disturbia.The Bucket Listkept bringing in business dipping only 22% to an estimated $4.1M for a $81.1Mtotal for Warner Bros.

The Fox hit spent asecond week at number one and fended off competition from a handful of newfilms. Among the new releases, films with multicultural casts delivered the mostimpressive averages. Tyler Perry‘slatest hit Meet the Brownsbowed in second place while the Latino drama Under the Same Moonopened in limited release but was still strong enough to crack the top ten. Thespookfest Shutterand the bodyguard comedy Drillbit Taylorwere met with lukewarm openings and landed in the top five. Overall, it was theworst Easter weekend box office in three years.The vocal talents ofJim Carrey and Steve Carellled Horton toan estimated $25.1M in ticket sales this weekend and represented a rathersizable 44% decline. The animated comedy was helped by the Good Friday holidaybut still posted a larger sophomore drop than other non-sequel March toons fromFox and Blue Sky Studios. 2002’s Ice Age fell 35% while Robotsdropped 42% in 2005. Plus neither film had any Easter help on the sophomoresession. After ten days of release, Horton has taken in a solid $86.5M which isjust 1% behind Ice Age at the same point in its release but 31% ahead ofRobots. Given the elephant pic’s warm reception with critics andaudiences, the relative lack of new competitors, and the holiday, a smallerdecline was expected. But despite the big drop, the Seuss extravaganza stillshould finish its domestic run in the neighborhood of $150M.Tyler Perrysecured the runnerup spot with his latest effort Meet the Brownswhich opened to an estimated $20M. The filmmaker’s fifth release in fouryears enjoyed the highest per-theater average of any film in the top ten with arobust $9,977 from 2,006 locations. The PG-13 film stars Angela Bassettand debuted in the same range as Perry’s last film Why Did I Get Married?which bowed to $21.4M last October from a similar number of theaters. It did nothave the Good Friday holiday to help its opening weekend though.Opening a little better than expected, Fox’s horror flick Shutterdebuted in third with an estimated $10.7M from 2,753 sites. The remake of a Thaifright hit averaged a mediocre $3,887 and played to a young female audience. Thestudio kept the marketing volume low until the final week before release when itmade an aggressive push at its target demo. Joshua Jacksonstars in Shutter as an American photographer in Tokyo who discovershaunting images in his snapshots. Reviews were dismal.Owen Wilson‘slatest comedy Drillbit Taylorposted a mild opening in fourth place taking in an estimated $10.2M from 3,056theaters. Averaging just $3,338 per site, the PG-13 pic about a bum hired bynerdy high school freshmen to be a bodyguard played to a tween and teenaudience. Reviews were negative for the Paramount release which proved thatwithout other major stars at his side (Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller,Jackie Chan), Owen Wilson is no sure thing at the box office.The caveman flick10,000 BC rankedfifth with an estimated $8.7M, down 48%, for a cume to date of $76.1M for WarnerBros. Summit’s first in-house production Never Back Downdropped an acceptable 44% in its second weekend and grossed an estimated $4.9M.With $16.8M collected in ten days, the $20M fight pic looks to reach roughly$25M by the end of its theatrical run.Disney’s family comedy College Road Tripslipped 41% to an estimated $4.6M in its third frame and raised its tally to$32M. Moviegoers continued to spread good word-of-mouth for the Jason Stathamheist actioner The Bank Jobwhich dipped only 19% to an estimated $4.1M for a $19.4M total. The Lionsgaterelease posted the smallest decline in the top ten two weeks in a row. Yetanother action film followed in ninth with Sony’s Vantage Pointwhich took in an estimated $3.8M, down just 30%, for a $65.3M cume.The immigration drama Under the Same Moondebuted to strong numbers in limited release and landed in the top ten right atthe ten spot. The Weinstein Company’s PG-13 film grossed an estimated $2.6M fromonly 266 locations and averaged a sturdy $9,782 per site. It scored the secondbest average in the top ten ranking just a bit below Meet the Browns.Since its Wednesday launch, the Sundance Film Festival audience favorite and itsmostly Latino cast has taken in a solid $3.3M.

TheWarner Bros. release bowed in 3,410 theaters to an estimated $35.7M and averageda sturdy $10,478 per site. A strong marketing push led by a brilliantly excitingtrailer helped to draw in a sizable audience which disregarded the dismalreviews.The opening was about half of the colossal $70.9M debut that the studio saw oneyear ago this weekend with its other historical epic adventure 300. However, that was amore stylized actioner which generated much more buzz and so B.C. wasnever expected to come close to the Spartan heights. Instead, the prehistoricpic opened stronger than many other big-budget spring action films like V For Vendetta($25.6M), Constantine($29.8M), and Hidalgo($18.8M).Overseas, 10,000 B.C. conquered the box office in 19 of its 20 marketsgrossing a combined $25.3M from 3,600 prints this weekend to boost theinternational cume to $61M. The global take will break the $100M barrier withindays.Disney claimed the runnerup spot with its kidpic College Road Tripwhich grossed an estimated $14M from 2,706 theaters. Averaging a respectable$5,174 per site, the G-rated film stars Martin Lawrenceand Raven-Symoneas a father-daughter pair on a trip to see prospective universities. Theperformance fell short of other Disney vehicles that tried to make a family manout of macho stars. The studio’sVin Diesel pic The Pacifierbowed to $30.6M in March 2005 while The Rock‘s The Game Plandebuted to $23M last September.

The dodgeball champ goes for holiday laughs with Fred Claus while the top gun offers up a serious political tale in Lions For Lambs. For those looking for a scare, the horror flick P2 also attacks the multiplexes. Add in last weekend’s holdover titles and the marketplace should deliver three $20M+ grossers for the first time since mid-July.Taming down their comedy for a family audience, the Wedding Crashers team of Vince Vaughn and director David Dobkin offer up Christmas cheer with the holiday comedy Fred Claus. The PG-rated pic features the comic actor playing the brother of Santa (Paul Giamatti). Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates both scored a ‘with’ credit while Kevin Spacey‘s agents landed the coveted ‘and’ credit for their client. Family audiences will make up the bulk of the business but Warner Bros. is hoping to draw teens and young adults with Vaughn’s humor.Reviews have been sour, but these types of holiday films are sold more on the comedy and the marketing. The studio is giving Claus a big jolly push and there are no major live-action options for parents to take their kids to. Bee Movie‘s second weekend will provide most of the competition, but usually two high-profile star-driven family pics can co-exist at this time of year. Debuting ultrawide in more than 3,400 theaters, Fred Claus may laugh up about $28M this weekend.Vince Vaughn and some friends in Fred ClausStudio boss Tom Cruise co-stars with Oscar winners Robert Redford and Meryl Streep in the new politically-themed drama Lions For Lambs from United Artists and MGM. Directed by Redford, the R-rated film examines the U.S. government’s involvement in the Middle East through three different stories. Cruise plays a hotshot senator who is interviewed by a veteran journalist, played by Streep. Redford stars as a wise college professor discussing the life with a star student. And in smaller roles, Derek Luke and Michael Peña are cast as university students determined to join the army to make this a better world.In a smart move, Lions has downplayed its political storyline involving the Middle East as most others that have gone down that path have crashed and burned at the box office this fall. Audiences have told Hollywood on numerous occasions that they are not interested in paying top dollar for that kind of entertainment. Instead, the film is being positioned as a dramatic thriller with great acting performances almost the same way Cruise’s A Few Good Men was marketed 15 years ago. Lions will skew older than most other releases in the marketplace and will face intense competition for adults from American Gangster. Plus bad reviews will have a big impact too since the target audience plays close attention to the opinions of critics. This could very well be Tom Cruise’s lowest-grossing film in ages. Landing in 2,200 locations, Lions For Lambs might debut with around $10M.Lions For LambsThe horror genre discovers a new location to find fear in – the parking garage! The new suspense thriller P2 from Summit Entertainment tells of a trapped woman on Christmas Eve who faces a security guard that stalks her. The R-rated pic will appeal to the few who did not get their fill of fright flicks during October. With no starpower and only a moderate push on the marketing side, don’t expect big numbers here. Most genre fans will wait for the DVD. P2 opens in about 2,000 theaters and could debut with around $3M over the weekend.P2After a powerhouse debut, American Gangster should witness a sizable drop in its second frame. Good word-of-mouth and Oscar buzz will prevent the decline from being too high though. A 45% fall would give the Ridley Scott pic roughly $24M for the weekend and a rock solid ten-day cume of $80M. Kidpics usually hold up well in early November so a slim decline for Bee Movie could result. Monday’s observance of Veterans Day will see many schools close and help give Sunday a boost too. Look for Paramount to see a 30% drop to about $27M for the Jerry Seinfeld toon which would raise the total to a healthy $75M after ten days.LAST YEAR: Moviegoers kept annoying friends with their best Kazakh impressions as Borat tripled its theatercount and remained at number one for the second week with $28.3M for Fox. Disney’s The Santa Clause 3 and Paramount’s Flushed Away enjoyed sensational holds and stayed put in their spots as well with $16.9M and $16.6M, respectively. Will Ferrell‘s Stranger Than Fiction bowed in fourth with $13.4M on its way to $40.1M for Sony.

Night Shyamalan’s Glass managed to fulfill its destiny: three weeks in the box-office top spot with very little competition to speak of, this weekend earning $9.5 million. But it was a slow week overall at the movies. The last time the box office had a victor that grossed under $10 million was the three-day Labor Day weekend of 2015 when War Room led with $9.4 million. Meanwhile,&nbsp;the biggest&nbsp;competition for Glass,&nbsp;The Upside,&nbsp;is going to come close to matching the Shyamalan film’s&nbsp;final total when all is said and done for both films at the box office.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Glass&nbsp;Holds No. 1 Spot with&nbsp;The Upside&nbsp;Close Behind(Photo by @ Universal Pictures)Glass remains&nbsp;on track for a $100 million domestic total and&nbsp;has earned more than $198 million worldwide. Split finished with $278 million across the globe with nearly half of that at home ($138.2 million). Shyamalan’s The Village had already crossed nine&nbsp;figures&nbsp;on its 17th day in theaters on its way to a $114 million total, and while Glass will become&nbsp;the director’s sixth&nbsp;$100 million grosser, it looks unlikely to beat that&nbsp;final number for The Village&nbsp;with next week’s big new releases set to dominate the weekend. The Upside, which posted just another small 26% drop this weekend (compared to 49% for Glass), could very well pass the superhero movie next weekend, sending it to sixth place in its fourth weekend.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Miss Bala&nbsp;Remake Fails to Light up Tomatometer and Box Office(Photo by Gregory Smith /© Columbia )Catherine Hardwicke’s remake of 2011’s Mexican smash&nbsp;Miss Bala was neither a hit with audiences nor critics this weekend. The $15 million production has garnered 28% on the Tomatometer so far and grossed $6.7 million across the weekend; the original Spanish-language feature registered an 87% with critics here. How does that compare with similarly themed films? The La Femme Nikita remake, Point of No Return, opened with $7.1 million back in 1993. Last year’s Proud Mary with Taraji P. Henson opened with $9.9 million and finished with just $20.8 million.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Winchester&nbsp;Scares Up Small Change,&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;Reclaims Top Spot(Photo by Ben King /© CBS Films)The Super Bowl’s big release was the horror film, Winchester (13% on the Tomatometer), which opened in third place with $9.3 million. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle reclaimed the no. 1 spot for its fourth victory in five weeks and surpassed $350 million domestic.

Fans ofaction and horror lined up for the threequel ResidentEvil: Extinction which bowed at number one while those in search of alaugh spent their dollars on the romantic comedy Good Luck Chuck.Both opened with averages of more than $5,000 each and helped to fill the entireTop Five with R-rated fare as the overall marketplace bounced back after recentsluggish weeks.Gamers still love to go to the movies. That’s what Sony learned with itsestimated $24M opening weekend for ResidentEvil: Extinction, the third and supposedly final chapter of the popularmovie franchise starringMilla Jovovich.If the estimate holds, it will give the latest chapter the best debut of theseries. 2002’s original premiered with $17.7M while its 2004 sequel ResidentEvil: Apocalypse bowed to $23M. Final grosses reached $39.5M and $50.7M,respectively. In a world where third parts rarely enjoy the biggest opening in aseries (The Bourne Ultimatum is the only other of this year’s seven threequelsto do so), Extinction‘s performance is noteworthy in that it generatedits strong gross from 456 fewer theaters than Apocalyspe had three yearsago.Dane Cook andJessica Albamade a popular couple as their new romantic comedy Good Luck Chuckopened in second place with a solid $14M, according to estimates. Lionsgatereleased the R-rated pic in 2,612 locations and averaged a commendable $5,360per site. Critics trashed the film but moviegoers paid no attention. The debutwas 23% better than the $11.4M opening of Cook’s last comedy,Employee of theMonth, which the distributor bowed last October. In Chuck, the actorplays a man who women find lucky since all his ex-girlfriends go on to getengaged after dating him.&nbsp;Jodie Fosterdropped two spots with her vigilante thriller The Brave One whichfell 45% to an estimated $7.4M in its second weekend. The Warner Bros. releasehas grossed $25.1M in ten days and should reach the vicinity of $44M, or alittle less than half of the grosses of the last starring roles for the actress– $89.7M for Flightplanand $95.3M for PanicRoom. The Lionsgate Western 3:10 to Yumacontinued to have good legs easing only 29% to an estimated $6.4M for a 17-daycume of $37.9M.&nbsp;The mob thriller Eastern Promises starring Viggo Mortensen expanded into nationwiderelease and jumped into fifth place with an estimated $5.7M. Widening from 15 to1,404 venues, the Focus title averaged a respectable $4,093 per site. Easterndid not show the same strength as directorDavidCronenberg’s last film A History ofViolence (another Viggo pic that opened limited in September) whichgrossed $8.1M and averaged $6,047 when it expanded nationally in its sophomoreframe two years ago. Cume for Eastern stands at $6.5M.&nbsp;Stumbling into sixth place was the newAmanda Bynesteen comedy SydneyWhite which bowed to an estimated $5.3M from 2,104 locations for a weak$2,530 average. The Universal release sets the classic Snow White story on amodern-day college campus and attracted half the business of Bynes’ last comedyShe’s theMan (an adaptation of Shakespeare’s The Twelfth Night) which opened to$10.7M in March 2006. Sydney skewed to a young female audience, as expected.&nbsp;New Line’s Billy Bob Thornton comedy Mr. Woodcockdropped 43% in its second weekend to an estimated $5M putting the ten-day totalat $15.7M. A $25-28M final seems likely. Fellow comedy Superbad grossed anestimated $3.1M, off 39%, giving Sony $116.2M to date. The studio also crossedthe $1 billion mark in domestic tickets sales for the sixth year in a row.&nbsp;Universal’s assassin smash The Bourne Ultimatumdipped only 32% to an estimated $2.8M pushing the domestic haul to $220.2M.Universal can now claim the only two summer films to spend eight weeks in thetop ten as the Matt Damon smash joined studio stablemate Knocked Up.Rounding out the top ten was the fantasy adventure Dragon Wars with anestimated $2.5M, down 50%, for a ten-day cume of only $8.6M.&nbsp;Debuting to scorching results in limited release wasSean Penn‘slatest directorial effort Into the Wildwhich banked an estimated $207,000 from only four theaters for a potent $51,649per site. The Paramount Vantage release starsEmile Hirsch,earned strong reviews, and helped critics get the bad taste of Penn’s All the King’s Menout of their mouths. Wild expands to the top dozen markets next weekend.&nbsp;Warner Bros. got off to a solid start with its Old West tale The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford which madeoff with an estimated $144,000 from 15 theaters for a $9,600 average. Ten of thelocations were in Austin with most double-screening the nearly-three-hour outlawtale. The Brad Pitt–CaseyAffleck starrer earned generally good notices from reviewers and will widenon Friday.&nbsp;With all the new films in wide release, four pictures dropped out of the top tenover the weekend. New Line’s Rush Hour 3 tookin an estimated $2.2M, off 33%, giving theJackie Chan–ChrisTucker vehicle $136.1M to date. Look for a final domestic gross of about$142M. Fellow franchise flick Halloween tumbled56% to an estimated $2.2M as well giving MGM $54.6M to date. A finish of $58Mseems likely.&nbsp;A weekend estimate of $1.7M greeted the comedies Balls of Furyfrom Focus and Mr. Bean’s Holiday from Universal. The ping pong pic fell 47% for a cumeof $31.3M while theRowan AtkinsonEurotrip eased 36% and has gathered $30.8M to date. A final domestic tally of$35M should result for each.&nbsp;Expanding successfully was the Sony musical saga Across theUniverse with an estimated $2.1M from only 276 theaters for animpressive $7,428 average. TheJulie Taymor-directedpic expanded from its platform debut in 23 venues last weekend and has raisedits total to $3M.&nbsp;Paramount launched the summer megahit Transformersin Imax theaters over the weekend and saw its weekend take jump 196% to anestimated $1.4M (including sales from standard-format screens). That pushed thecume to $313.6M putting the robots in disguise at number 21 on the list ofall-time domestic blockbusters and less than $1 million away from tossing The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ($314.2M) out of theTop 20.&nbsp;The top ten films grossed an estimated $76.2M which was off 1% from last yearwhen Jackass:Number Two debuted in first place with $29M; and down 10% from 2005 whenFlightplan opened in the top spot with $24.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"true, Returns, reboot, FOX, worst, anthology, Pop, award, Geographic, indie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Resident-Evil-Sets-New-Series-High-Score-at-1"},{"id":"47509150799909","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Halloween Strikes on the 31st","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Halloween Strikes on the 31stThree new releases try to conquer the weekend box office.by Gitesh Pandya | August 30, 2007 |  CommentsThe four-billion-dollar-plus summer comes to a close over the long Labor Day holiday weekend with three new wide releases all targeting male moviegoers. Slasher fans get to relive old days with the latest incarnation of Halloween, teens looking for a laugh get the ping pong comedy Balls of Fury, and adults interested in Kevin Bacon‘s brand of revenge have the action thriller Death Sentence. With target audiences for the new pics having lots of overlap, and the existing holdovers also catering to similar crowds, the marketplace will have to work hard to expand as many of these titles will eat into each other.Setting a new industry record for the widest opening ever over Labor Day weekend, rock-star-turned-director Rob Zombie‘s Halloween attacks theaters aiming to connect with horror movie fans. The R-rated entry marks the first new installment in five years for a franchise about to hit the three-decade mark. 2002’s Halloween: Resurrection bowed to $12.3M and a solid $6,291 average in mid-July of that summer proving that Michael Myers still had the muscle to draw in his fans. The arrival of a new Halloween flick coupled with the selection of a buzzworthy director makes for an interesting combo that will spark interest with genre fans.To say that horror has hit some bad luck at the box office this year is putting it lightly. R-rated fright flicks in 2007 have struggled but Halloween will try to change that. Excitement among fans is considerable and with no other gorefests out there, competition will come mainly from the many action films or teen comedies. The Jeepers Creepers films proved how successful Labor Day weekend could be for a horror pic and now MGM and The Weinstein Company hope demand will still be there for their newest entry. Attacking 3,472 theaters, Halloween might collect about $20M over the Friday-to-Monday holiday weekend.Rob Zombie’s HalloweenThe ping pong pic Balls of Fury, enters the marketplace in a good position as the frame’s only new comedy and only new PG-13 flick. The Focus release should stand out as a viable option for teenagers looking to kill some time with goofy immature fun. Starring Dan Fogler, Christopher Walken, George Lopez, Maggie Q, and Aisha Tyler, Balls is trying to market itself as a film that fans of Dodgeball would dig. Of course it doesn’t have the star wattage of a Vince or a Ben so the grosses will be much smaller. But as a B-list comedy, it does its job and should satisfy its target audience in the short term. The marketing push has been good and perfectly matches the silly nature of the film. Focus moved up its release date from a Friday opening to a Wednesday bow hoping to take advantage of most schools still being out of session. Plus the distrib expects some good word-of-mouth midweek could help its chances come the weekend. Playing in 3,052 theaters by Friday, Balls of Fury could launch with about $14M over four days and $17M over six days.Dan Fogler in Balls of FuryAisha Tyler stars in another film opening this weekend taking a supporting role in the Kevin Bacon revenge thriller Death Sentence. Directed by Saw‘s James Wan, the R-rated pic finds the Footloose star playing a mild-mannered executive pushed to the edge to protect his family. Co-starring Kelly Preston and John Goodman, the Fox release should skew to an older adult audience which makes the long-lasting hit The Bourne Ultimatum a direct threat despite being in its fifth frame. The weekend’s other male-skewing pics will also steal away some biz so a modest bow is likely. Opening in roughly 1,900 theaters, Death Sentence might debut with about $7M over the long weekend.Kevin Bacon in Death SentenceSony’s hit comedy Superbad, which has become must-see viewing for high school and college students heading back to school, should lose its crown after two weeks on top. But the raunchy teen smash will still post a solid gross despite heavy competition from new releases. Superbad‘s four-day take might drop 25% from last weekend’s three-day tally to around $13.5M which would boost the 18-day cume to a sensational $90M.Since Labor Day weekend tends to be a catch-up time when people see popular flicks they’ve missed out on, another strong performance is likely to greet The Bourne Ultimatum which has easily been the top-grossing film of the past month. The new films will cause a distraction with younger moviegoers, but mature adults who may not have had time for Jason Bourne’s identity-revealing saga are sure to line up. Look for the four-day gross to dip by only 10% from last weekend giving the Universal blockbuster about $11M for the long weekend which would allow the assassin pic to cross the $200M mark on Monday.Fellow threequel Rush Hour 3 should experience a larger drop and could fall by 25% to about $9M. That would put the total at $121M for New Line.LAST YEAR: Mark Wahlberg scored back-to-back box office touchdowns with his sports drama Invincible which remained at number one for the second straight time with $15.4M over the four-day holiday weekend. Opening in the runnerup spot was Jason Statham‘s action pic Crank with $12.9M over the long weekend which edged out the debuting Nicolas Cage drama The Wicker Man which took in $11.7M. Final grosses reached $27.8M for the Lionsgate film and $23.6M for the Paramount pic. Rounding out the top five were Little Miss Sunshine with $9.6M and The Illusionist with $8.1M over four days.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Skip, X-Men, competition, Studios, TV, joker, toronto, dogs, Network, WarnerMedia, curtis, Holiday, globes, Games","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Halloween-Strikes-on-the-31st"},{"id":"47509149085711","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Mr. Skywalker and Ms. Storm in New Thriller","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Mr. Skywalker and Ms. Storm in New ThrillerAwake is the lone film opening in wide release.by Gitesh Pandya | November 29, 2007 |  CommentsOnly one new film ventures into wide release. Studios typically avoid opening worthwhile pics during the weekend after the Thanksgiving frame since moviegoing subsides and holiday shopping becomes a bigger national priority. Overall ticket sales tumble by 40-50% from the previous frame and holdovers usually lead the way. That means Disney’s princess tale Enchanted should continue to reign supreme at the North American box office, but those looking for a scare will have the new thriller Awake to see. After a robust turkey frame, look for the marketplace to settle down as movie fans nibble on leftovers.What happens when Darth Vader marries the Invisible Woman? You get a horror film set in a hospital, of course. Awake stars Hayden Christensen as a man who undergoes surgery while remaining conscious and Jessica Alba plays the troubled wife. The R-rated psychological thriller from MGM and The Weinstein Co. will target young adults with a semi-intriguing premise and a dash of starpower.Outside of the Star Wars prequels, young Anakin has no pull with ticket buyers but Alba has shown box office strength over the years and can often be a draw even when not suited up in Fantastic Four gear. As with so many of her previous films, trailers feature quick shots of her semi-nude body which should titillate male moviegoers. But overall excitement is not too high and the audience could be limited here with the eventual DVD release reaching the bulk of the film’s fans. Opening in about 2,000 theaters, Awake may gross around $6M this weekend.Hayden Christensen, Terence Howard and Jessica Alba in AwakeA pair of film festival favorites with Oscar hopes will open in platform release this weekend. Fox Searchlight offers the estranged sibling comedy The Savages starring Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The R-rated film played earlier this year at Sundance, Telluride, and Toronto. Debuting in the same two Manhattan theaters is Miramax’s French drama The Diving Bell and the Butterfly about a magazine editor who after suffering a stroke, can only communicate with one eyelid. The PG-13 film scored the Best Director trophy at Cannes.Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney in The SavagesWith only one new offering in wide play, look for the box office chart to look awfully familiar. Nine of the top ten titles will probably be the same as last week’s. Disney’s family hit Enchanted is set to retain its crown and stay the leader. A 50% drop could result, especially since Friday is not a day off this time around. That would give the fairy tale flick about $17M for the weekend and a solid 12-day cume of $70M.Following its surprisingly strong premiere, the family reunion film This Christmas should fall sharply on the sophomore session. A 55% decline would leave Sony with $8M and an impressive total of $36M after a dozen days.Young males targeted by Beowulf and Hitman will be distracted somewhat by another one-word-titled film making its debut. With Alba in that cast, it could lead to steep drops of 55% each. That would put Paramount’s 3D adventure toon at around $7.5M for the weekend for a sum of $68M. Hitman would slide down to $6M for Fox and a total of $30M.LAST YEAR: For the third straight weekend, the penguin-Bond connection ruled the box office with ease. The animated blockbuster Happy Feet remained the number one film once again with $17.5M for Warner Bros. while Sony’s 007 pic Casino Royale took the silver with $15.1M. In the first 17 days of play, moviegoers spent an astounding $237M on the dynamic duo. Denzel Washington‘s action thriller Deja Vu stayed put in third place with $10.9M in its sophomore frame. Debuting in fourth was the religious drama The Nativity Story with $7.8M on its way to a $37.6M final for New Line. Rounding out the top five was Fox’s Christmas comedy Deck the Halls with $6.7M. Also debuting but to modest numbers were Fox’s horror pic Turistas with $3.6M and MGM’s Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj with $2.3M. Final grosses reached $7M and $4.3M, respectively.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Mr-Skywalker-and-Ms-Storm-in-New-Thriller"},{"id":"47509150791711","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup:Game Plan Rushes Past Kingdom For #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup:Game Plan Rushes Past Kingdom For #1 SpotFeast opening less than lovely.by Gitesh Pandya | September 30, 2007 |  CommentsIn a fierce head-to-head battle,The Rock‘sfamily comedy TheGame Plan upsetJamie Foxx‘saction thriller TheKingdom this weekend and became the first PG-rated film since June toopen at number one. The wrestler-turned-actor collected an estimated $22.7M inticket sales for his first kidpic and exceeded industry expectations going intothe weekend. Disney’s latest hit comedy averaged a solid $7,307 from 3,103theaters. Game marked The Rock’s second biggest opening ever in a lead roleafter 2002’s The Scorpion King which bowed to $36.1M.The film is the latest to take a macho action star and put him in afamily-friendly situation involving kids. In The Game Plan,The Rock plays a superstar quarterback and stylish bachelor who finds out he hasa daughter. The studio found success with the same formula two years ago withVin Diesel‘sThe Pacifierwhich debuted much better than expected with $30.6M on its way to an amazing$113.1M. Game Plan also tapped into a family audience starving forentertainment as the past several weeks have been dominated by adult fare andR-rated movies for older teens. Studio research showed that 52% of the audiencewas female, 53% was under 25, and two-thirds of the crowd consisted of families.With a CinemaScore grade of A, and most October releases offering nothingexciting for kids, Disney should expect playability for many weeks to come.Settling for the runnerup spot but still generating solid results was The Kingdom whichpremiered to an estimated $17.7M. The Universal release averaged an impressive$6,335 from 2,793 locations. Carrying the R rating, thePeter Berg-directedfilm finds Jamie Foxx leading a team of FBI agents into Saudi Arabia toinvestigate an attack on Americans living there. Critics were mixed in theirreviews. Jennifer Garner,Chris Cooper,Jason Bateman,and Jeremy Pivenco-star. Unlike Game Plan, Kingdom faced plenty of competitiongiven that the marketplace offered several other serious films aimed at adultaudiences.Last weekend’s top film ResidentEvil: Extinction collapsed in its second frame tumbling 66% to anestimated $8M for a ten-day tally of $36.8M. The Sony threequel should finish upin the same neighborhood as its predecessor ResidentEvil: Apocalypse which grossed $50.7M three years ago at the same timeof year.Lionsgate followed with a pair of pics. The romantic comedy Good Luck Chuckfell 54% to an estimated $6.3M for a cume of $23.6M in ten days. A $35M finalseems likely.

Cumes stand at $11.2M and $8.6M,respectively.Jumping into the top ten was the musical film Across theUniverse which grossed an estimated $2.1M from only 339 theaters for asolid $6,047 average. Sony widened the release slightly from 276 locations andwill continue to expand in the weeks ahead. Universe has banked $5.5M todate in limited release.Two films from acclaimed directors enjoyed sizzling platform debuts in NewYork City this weekend. Fox Searchlight’sWes Andersonpic TheDarjeeling Limited debuted on Saturday and grossed an estimated $140,000from only two theaters for a powerful two-day average of $70,000. The distribwill add 17 more theaters in six additional markets on Friday.Ang Lee, thefirst non-white man to win the Oscar for Best Director, debuted his latest filmLust, Caution in oneManhattan location and was greeted with an estimated $62,000.

Bruce Willis got the action going in second place with the debut of his new shoot-em-up sequel \"Live Free or Die Hard.\"The Michael Moore documentary \"Sicko\" and the femme-driven drama \"Evening\" saw much smaller grosses in their national openings but still landed in the top ten. The overall box office was slightly better than last year’s as the the first half of 2007 came to a close.\"Ratatouille\" cooked up an estimated $47.2M in its premiere frame hitting the top spot, but the G-rated toon delivered the smallest opening for Pixar since 1998’s \"A Bug’s Life\" which bowed nationwide over the Thanksgiving session to $33.3M over three days (roughly $40M at today’s ticket prices). The new entry about a rodent that secretly cooks up delicious meals in a Paris restaurant fell short of the debut numbers posted by recent Pixar offerings like last summer’s \"Cars\" ($60.1M), 2004’s \"The Incredibles\" ($70.5M), and 2003’s \"Finding Nemo\" ($70.3M). With every company in Hollywood now producing computer-animated films for kids, and \"Cars\" driving into theaters just one year ago, \"Ratatouille\" lacked the event status that most Pixar pics carried with them.Still, reviews were sensational and while the film may have been a bit of a tough sell upfront, strong word-of-mouth could give the rat pic solid legs in the weeks ahead, especially with the Independence Day holiday week coming up. Pixar films often go on to reach four or fives times their opening weekend numbers domestically so joining the $200M club is still possible. The French setting could also boost overseas sales. Most recent Pixar films earned more internationally than domestically except for \"Cars\" which boasted a very American NASCAR-type storyline.Opening at number two with a similar gross, but spread out over five days, was the Bruce Willis action sequel \"Live Free or Die\" Hard which collected an estimated $33.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and $48.2M since its Wednesday launch. Playing in 3,408 theaters, the Fox release averaged a healthy $9,727 over three days. Studio research showed that the PG-13 film skewed a bit older and a bit more male, as expected. With the franchise being dormant for twelve years, it was a challenge to make this new \"Die Hard\" picture relevant to today’s young summer moviegoers. \"Live Free\" earned strong reviews from critics and overseas, where its title is \"Die Hard 4.0,\" grosses are expected to be significantly stronger as evidenced by 1995’s \"Die Hard With A Vengeance\" which collected a whopping 72% of its $361M worldwide total from outside of North America.Steve Carell’s comedy \"Evan Almighty\" dropped 52% in its second weekend to an estimated $15.1M and fell two spots to third place. Universal has collected $60.6M in ten days and seems headed for the $100M mark by the end of the run. That makes \"Evan\" the summer’s biggest underachiever given its reported $175M production cost and the fact that it has grossed less than half as much as \"Bruce Almighty\" did in its first ten days four years ago.The hotel room thriller \"1408\" declined by 49% in its sophomore frame and collected an estimated $10.6M. John Cusack’s latest film has scared up a solid $40.4M after ten days and could finish with an impressive $70M for MGM making it the year’s second biggest horror film after \"Disturbia.\"Falling 55% to an estimated $9M was \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" which has banked $114.8M to date. The PG-rated Fox sequel is off 7% from the 17-day cume of its PG-13 predecessor from 2005.Universal’s comedy \"Knocked Up\" placed sixth with an estimated $7.4M, down only 32%, for a cume of $122.4M. \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" followed falling 47% to an estimated $6.1M giving Warner Bros. $102.1M domestically. The international tally climbed to $124.1M boosting the worldwide total to $226M and counting.Disney’s Captain Jack saga \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" ranked eighth with an estimated $5M dipping only 30% in its sixth voyage. The North American cume stands at $295.8M putting it at number 25 the all-time domestic blockbusters list just behind 2003’s first \"Pirates\" adventure which grossed $305.4M. Overseas, the third Pirates film surged to $608.9M raising the global gross to an astounding $904.7M allowing it to surpass \"Spider-Man 3\" to become the top-grossing film worldwide in 2007. At World’s End has also become the sixth biggest blockbuster of all-time overseas and only the ninth movie ever to break the $900M mark globally.Michael Moore’s new documentary \"Sicko\" opened nationwide over the weekend and placed ninth with an estimated $4.5M from only 441 theaters for a solid $10,204 average. Though it was an impressive debut, it was nowhere near the $23.9M opening and $27,558 average of the filmmaker’s last release \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" from June 2004. That controversial film went on to become the top-grossing doc ever with $119.2M. \"Sicko,\" a criticism of America’s health care problems, failed to attract the same amount of controversy and has gotten off to a slower start for Lionsgate. Cume is $4.6M including an exclusive one-week run in New York City.The dying-mother drama \"Evening\" bowed with weak results in tenth place with an estimated $3.5M from 977 sites for a mild $3,596 average. Focus saw poor reviews for its femme-driven drama.At 2007’s halfway point, the top five summer films (led by \"Spider-Man 3\"’s $333.7M) have collectively grossed $1.18 billion, up 31% from last year. The top five blockbusters of the overall year have combined for a $1.32 billion, up an encouraging 37% from this point in 2006, so the marketplace has certainly been healthy with some big hits, even if some have not met the industry’s high expectations.Four films tumbled out of the top ten over the weekend. Paramount’s \"Shrek the Third\" fell 51% to an estimated $2.7M giving the DreamWorks toon $313.8M to date. That allowed the $170M-budgeted ogre tale to crack the Top 20 on the all-time domestic list at number 20 right behind \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" which took in $314.2M. Look for a final of about $320M which would be substantially behind the $436.7M of \"Shrek 2\" which currently ranks number three all-time. Worldwide, \"Shrek the Third\" has grossed over $500M with many major markets yet to open.Rival toon \"Surf’s Up\" grossed an estimated $2.4M, off a steep 64%, giving Sony $53.7M thus far. A mediocre $60M final could result. The teen girl pic \"Nancy Drew\" fell 56% to an estimated $1.9M for a $21.3M sum. Warner Bros. should end its run with only $25M or so. Paramount Vantage’s \"A Mighty Heart\" dropped 61% to an estimated $1.6M giving the Angelina Jolie pic just $7M in ten days. A $10M final seems likely.The top ten films grossed an estimated $141.6M which was up a scant 2% from last year when \"Superman Returns\" opened at number one with $52.5M; and up 9% from 2005 when \"War of the Worlds\" debuted on top with $64.9M over three days.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"a, Book, period, Pacific, of, hispanic, actors, Bravo","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ratatouille-Becomes-Top-Chef-of-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509152553006","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Mmmmmmmmmmm Box Office Feast!","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Mmmmmmmmmmm Box Office Feast!Simpsons Movie takes on three others for weekend box officeby Gitesh Pandya | July 26, 2007 |  CommentsBart, Lisa, and the whole gang from Springfield will charge into multiplexes across North America and much of the world this weekend in the highly anticipated animated comedy The Simpsons Movie which looks to easily conquer the box office. But competing studios do have other menu items in store for moviegoers. Catherine Zeta-Jones stars in the romantic comedy No Reservations, Lindsay Lohan headlines the grisly thriller I Know Who Killed Me, and hip hop star Big Boi tries out the world of golf comedy in Who’s Your Caddy?Fox is aiming for hardcore followers and casual fans alike with its long-in-the-works comedy The Simpsons Movie which hits screens at midnight on Thursday night. The PG-13 film has a substantial built-in audience and should play out like a semi-sequel. To some extent it will be one of the more unpredictable openings of the summer since there is no track record of Simpsons fans leaving their TVs and paying money at the box office, however the fan base is sizable and will definitely come out upfront. Reviews have been good too so those who tuned out a decade ago and miss the Bobo years should return to try out what the feature-length entree is like.The studio gets major points for executing what is certainly one of the best marketing campaigns of the year. From turning a dozen 7-11s into Kwik-E-Marts to the SimpsonizeMe web promotion, The Simpsons Movie has been generating substantial interest and has jumped from the entertainment pages to the front pages becoming a major pop culture event. That should lead to a powerful opening weekend, even if large drops follow. The marketplace will get crowded this weekend, however Simpsons will tower over its foes with ease. In fact its nearest competitors should only be in the teen millions so Krusty and company will get the attention of most folks. Busting into 3,922 theaters, The Simpsons Movie could open in the neighborhood of $54M.The Simpsons MovieThe German film Mostly Martha gets transformed into a star-driven Hollywood vehicle in the comedy No Reservations featuring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Abigail Breslin. The PG-rated film features the T-Mobile lady playing a control freak chef who must care for her niece when her sister is killed. Warner Bros. offered sneak previews last weekend to help get some buzz going since the marketplace is getting so crowded now. No Reservations should skew more female making the hotter-than-expected Hairspray a formidable competitor. Starpower is not too high here which will make for another challenge at the box office. Serving up love and laughs in 2,425 locations, No Reservations could gross roughly $9M over the weekend.No ReservationsWhat seemed like a good idea a year ago – Lindsay Lohan headlining a thriller – now looks to become an unfortunate casualty of the summer box office race. I Know Who Killed Me, an R-rated scarefest from Sony, hits theaters on Friday riding a wave of bad publicity surrounding its star. Is all publicity, good publicity? Will Lohan’s arrests and substance abuse problems help sell more tickets? Moviegoers will decide that, but Killed enters the marketplace without a lot of fanfare. Hollywood has run the horror genre into the ground this year with an overabundance of product and this one’s harsh rating will make it much tougher to get Lohan’s fan base in. The film looked promising a month ago when scenes of the mean girl doing a stripper routine were released online. But most of the intrigue has evaporated and the pic now stands as yet another scary movie that ticket buyers don’t need. Debuting in about 1,200 locations, I Know Who Killed Me may collect around $4M.I Know Who Killed MeMGM releases the golf comedy Who’s Your Caddy? which stars hip hop players Big Boi and Lil Wayne. The PG-13 pic tells of a rap mogul who invades and turns upside-down an elite country club. Opening in only 1,019 theaters with a low-volume marketing push, Caddy is not looking to lead the pack at all but comes as a small offering for teens on summer vacation too bored to see anything else. Given the high amount of competition and the low amount of starpower, the grosses should be small. Who’s Your Caddy? might take in about $2M this weekend.Who’s Your Caddy?As if the weekend wasn’t crowded enough, a handful of films that have posted impressive results in limited release test the waters in many more theaters. MGM widens the acclaimed military drama Rescue Dawn from 57 to more than 500 runs, Fox Searchlight expands its sci-fi thriller Sunshine from ten to over 400 locations, and Focus jumps from 36 to 115 playdates with its well-reviewed Don Cheadle starrer Talk To Me. All three should find themselves in the Top 20.Rescue DawnHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix took a beating last weekend when the final wizard book hit the shelves. The drop could stabilize this weekend despite the arrival of Apu and friends. A 45% decline would give the Hogwarts clan about $18M and a 19-day cume of $242M.Adam Sandler comedies typically drop by 45-50% on the second weekend depending on how well received they are. I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry is not exactly a fan favorite so sales could get sliced in half and fall to about $17M. That would still give the Universal comedy about $70M after ten days.New Line enjoyed a better than expected bow for the musical Hairspray which gave the studio its best opening in two years. However its Friday-to-Saturday drop of 15% last weekend indicates that it might be a front-loaded title. Look for a 50% fall to around $14M giving the John Travolta vehicle a ten-day tally of $59M.LAST YEAR: Universal’s summer action entry Miami Vice opened atop the charts with $25.7M on its way to $63.5M domestically and $164M worldwide. After three weeks at number one, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest slipped to second with $20.6M. Fox’s teen comedy John Tucker Must Die enjoyed a solid opening in third with $14.3M leading to a $41M final. The animated film Monster House followed with $11.7M in its sophomore frame. Rounding out the top five was rival toon The Ant Bully with a $8.4M opening on its way to a disappointing $28.1M for Warner Bros. Introducing herself to the world in limited release was Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine which went on to become a critical and commercial hit grabbing $59.9M at the box office plus four Oscar nominations.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"on","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Mmmmmmmmmmm-Box-Office-Feast"},{"id":"47509152562226","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Transformers\" Already Dominating Holiday Week","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Transformers\" Already Dominating Holiday Weekby Gitesh Pandya | July 5, 2007 |  CommentsMegatron and his sinister robot chums invade the North American box office aiming to extract riches from the multiplexes over the extended Fourth of July holiday week with the tentpole action vehicle \"Transformers.\"Also entering the marketplace, but likely to gross only a fraction of the cash, is the comedy \"License to Wed\" starring Robin Williams. With Independence Day falling on a Wednesday, moviegoers have all different kinds of schedules with some having only one day off from work while others are taking extra time for themselves. That will make for a tricky box office trajectory since ticket buyers have many films to choose from and many days to make their trip to cinemas.Paramount sets off the fireworks with \"Transformers\" which already got an early start to the holiday week with a strong $8.8M in ticket sales on Monday night with shows beginning at 8pm. The PG-13 film from director Michael Bay is adapted from the popular toys and cartoon series that became a cult favorite in the 1980s, but instead has been geared up to fit modern summer movie standards with action, humor, and plenty of special effects. Shia LaBeouf stars alongside Tyrese Gibson, Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson, and John Turturro.[Editor’s Note: \"Transformers\" broke records for having the biggest opening on a Tuesday at $27.9 million, according to Boxofficemojo.com. As of Wednesday night (the original \"official\" release date), \"Transformers\" had raked in $36.7 million at the box office — a figure that grants the flick the title of Best 4th of July opening ever. That number (what many have pointed out amounts to over $36 million in 36 hours of release, or $1 million per hour and $16,666 per minute) results from the Paramount release’s $8.8 million Monday night take combined with $27.9 million on Tuesday. An additional $29.1 million from Wednesday’s moviegoers bumps the current \"Transformers\" box office to $65.7 million — and there are four more days to go.]\"Transformers\" is trying hard to follow in the footsteps of \"Independence Day\" which eleven years ago this week wreaked havoc on the box office with a Fourth of July opening week gross of $96.1M over five and a half days beginning with Tuesday night shows starting earlier at 6pm. That would amount to about $125M at today’s ticket prices from 1,129 fewer theaters than what the robots in disguise now control. Both films are essentially disaster pictures about alien forces that invade Earth that are driven by amazing special effects and feature ensemble casts with no huge stars.The fanboy crowd has been energized for months for \"Transformers\" so that vote is locked in. To really see the grosses soar, Paramount and DreamWorks will need non-fans to pony up the dough and take interest not because they remember watching the cartoon as a kid, but because it looks and feels like good escapist summer fare. Luckily the pic delivers on that. Appeal to teens and young adults is potent but older adults looking for action may be tempted to buy a ticket for Bruce Willis in the latest \"Die Hard\" sequel. In addition, younger children afraid of mean transforming robots will instead line up for \"Ratatouille.\" But so far reviews have been pretty good for its genre and fans are giving high marks too as witnessed by the encouraging A- average grade from over 6,000 votes on Yahoo Movies.Other effects-driven sci-fi action tentpoles opening over this extended holiday week include 2002’s \"Men in Black II\" with $87.2M over five days, 2003’s R-rated \"Terminator 3\" with $72.4M over five and a half days, and $100.5M over five days for \"War of the Worlds\" in 2005. Optimus Prime should soar higher since it has a full six and a half days of play this week by the time Sunday night arrives. Invading 4,011 theaters, \"Transformers\" might gross about $67M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a stellar $130M from Monday night through Sunday.\"Transformers\"Taking one of his worst beatings from critics in years, Oscar winner Robin Williams hit multiplexes on Tuesday with his latest comedy \"License to Wed\" playing a wacky priest who puts a newly engaged couple through a series of tests before marrying them. The PG-13 film stars Mandy Moore and \"The Office\"’s John Krasinski as the lucky twosome. The Warner Bros. title is slotted into this extra long holiday week as counter-programming to the Decepticons and hopes to appeal to women and adult couples not interested in the summer’s umpteenth action extravaganza.Aside from the former Mork, \"License\" has no real starpower at the box office. Even Williams has struggled to pack them in on opening weekend in recent years. His last film \"Man of the Year\" bowed to $12.3M last fall. Word-of-mouth is not likely to be very positive and if anything, the early opening may spread bad buzz as by Friday many will hear from friends that they should avoid this pic. The midweek debut will also dilute the weekend numbers too. A stronger title could have excelled this week with the target audience given all the testosterone flicks, but this one just doesn’t have the goods. Opening in 2,401 theaters, \"License to Wed\" might collect about $11M over the weekend and $18M during the extended Tuesday-to-Sunday debut period.\"License to Wed\"Disney and Pixar enjoyed a brief three-day stint in the number one spot last weekend with \"Ratatouille\" before being pushed aside by the Autobots on Monday. Second weekend drops for Pixar’s summer toons include 44% for last year’s \"Cars\" and a slimmer 34% for 2003’s \"Finding Nemo.\" The rodent flick is well-liked by moviegoers and competition for younger children is not too direct this coming weekend so a decline in between those two may result. A 35% drop would give \"Ratatouille\" about $30M for the weekend and a ten-day cume of $109M.\"Ratatouille\"Bruce Willis will have his hands full with \"Live Free or Die Hard\" on the second weekend thanks to fierce direct competition from \"Transformers.\" A 50% drop would not be surprising and would give Fox around $16.5M for the session boosting the 12-day tally to $83M. Universal’s \"Evan Almighty\" should continue its rapid slide and dip by 45% to roughly $8M. That would put the Steve Carell comedy at $78M after 17 days.LAST YEAR: After a long four-year term as the top opening of all-time, \"Spider-Man\" had its record stolen by Captain Jack as \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest\" crushed the industry mark with an eye-popping three-day bow of $135.6M. The Disney smash easily became the biggest blockbuster of the year with $423.3M domestically and a towering $1.065 billion worldwide and it still stands as the third largest global grosser of all-time. \"Superman Returns\" tumbled down to second place falling by a disturbing 59% to $21.8M for Warner Bros. Fox’s \"The Devil Wears Prada\" enjoyed a better sophomore hold dropping 46% to $15M for third place. Rounding out the top five were Adam Sandler‘s \"Click\" with $11.9M for Sony and Disney/Pixar’s \"Cars\" with $10.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.comSource: Boxofficemojo.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"sports, Network, Mudbound, drama, york, cats, nbcuniversal, Teen, justice, camera, TV, Islander, Dark","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Transformers-Already-Dominating-Holiday-Week"},{"id":"47509152566324","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Rats and Bruce Hit Theaters This Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Rats and Bruce Hit Theaters This Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | June 28, 2007 |  CommentsDisney and Pixar aim for their eighth straight number one hit together with the latest computer animated film from the industry experts, \"Ratatouille.\"For those looking for a higher body count in their weekend entertainment, Fox offers the actioner \"Live Free or Die Hard\" which stands as the ninth sequel in nine weeks this summer. In more limited national release, Lionsgate expands its Michael Moore documentary \"Sicko\" while Focus opens its anti-\"Die Hard\" pic \"Evening.\" This weekend’s box office champ will only have a short-lived stay at number one since \"Transformers\" will begin its assault on the multiplexes on Monday night attacking at 8pm.Scurrying into its usual position atop the charts, Pixar returns to capture the family audience with \"Ratatouille\" hoping for what could be a long run at the summer box office. The G-rated pic tells of a lovable rat with a gift for cooking that finds itself working secretly in a famous Paris restaurant with a clumsy human boy. Brad Bird (\"The Incredibles,\" \"The Iron Giant\") directs and the voice cast includes Patton Oswalt, Peter O’Toole, Brian Dennehy, and Janeane Garofalo. Not the biggest names in the biz, but this one will not be sold on the starpower of actors. It is the Pixar brand name, and to an extent the Disney logo, that will bring in paying customers. Parents and children know they are guaranteed a great time so the brand will sell itself. Reviews have also been glowing across the board which will help too.Last summer, the Disney/Pixar team saw its \"Cars\" drive off with $60.1M on opening weekend on its way to a $244.1M final which by the end of the year made it the second biggest blockbuster of 2006 after \"Dead Man’s Chest.\" \"Night at the Museum\"’s prolonged run into 2007 allowed it to eventually surpass \"Cars.\" Pixar’s previous toons \"The Incredibles\" and \"Finding Nemo\" both bowed at the $70M mark however. \"Ratatouille\" will cater to the same audience, but direct competition for families will be tougher than it was with the prior pics. Though fading fast, \"Evan Almighty\" and the \"Fantastic Four\" sequel are both PG films specifically designed to appeal to kids and should steal away close to $25M combined. But the rat film should enjoy an extended stay in North American multiplexes as word-of-mouth will be very positive and moviegoers will enjoy having a new story with new characters instead of the same old sequels all the time. Launching in over 3,500 theaters, \"Ratatouille\" could gross about $57M this weekend.\"Ratatouille\"Bruce Willis returns to his signature franchise after a dozen-year gap with \"Live Free or Die Hard,\" Fox’s next big entry into the summer movie sweepstakes. Keeping with the new fad of tamer ratings, the fourth installment of the series keeps the action high but cuts back on extended shots of blood and foul language in order to secure the PG-13. The previous \"Die Hards\" were all R-rated with the last two being number one openers. Directed by Len Wiseman, who helmed both \"Underworld\" pics, \"Live Free\" co-stars Justin Long and finds Bruce’s John McClane character assigned to protect a computer hacker who holds the key to stopping a virtual terrorist from taking control of the country electronically.Since today’s teenagers never felt the excitement of rushing out to the theaters to see a new \"Die Hard\" flick, the studio has worked hard to make it relevant to the most sought after demographic so they don’t think of this as their father’s action movie. The new rating, the high-tech plot, and the Mac-friendly Long could certainly help. Plus in a summer filled with super heroes and pirates, \"Die Hard\" gets retro with action not driven by effects, but by stunts. The audience should skew male and older. Plus there are die hard \"Die Hard\" fans that have been waiting patiently for twelve years that will be out upfront to see their hero return. Reviews have been good and the film actually delivers solid entertainment without being the type of creative disappointment that audiences have unfortunately become used to this summer. Opening Wednesday in 3,172 theaters, \"Live Free or Die Hard\" could generate about $31M over the three-day weekend and around $48M over the five-day debut period.\"Live Free or Die Hard\"Oscar winner Michael Moore turns his wrath on the health care system in his latest documentary \"Sicko.\" The PG-13 entry comes with the filmmaker’s usual desperate need to generate controversy in order to sell tickets. The new film does not carry with it the monstrous buzz that propelled \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" to a surprise number one opening three years ago. Given the subject matter, \"Sicko\" should skew older. Lionsgate is rolling the film out slowly instead of opening nationwide on the first weekend as it should take a little longer to get people interested in buying a ticket. The distributor is hoping that last weekend’s solo New York debut, last Saturday’s sneak previews in Moore-friendly markets, and this frame’s limited expansion to a few hundred sites will get people talking as the country heads into the Fourth of July holiday week ahead. Holiday buzz would then justify a wider rollout. Expanding to 441 theaters on Friday, \"Sicko\" could collect about $7M and generate a sizzling per-theater average.\"Sicko\"In the weekend’s toughest sell, acclaimed Hollywood actresses band together to define the term \"chick flick\" with the dying-mother drama \"Evening.\" Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Claire Danes, and Toni Collette star in the Focus release which should see most of its business come from white adult women. The PG-13 film is trying to offer summer ticket buyers an alternative to the endless string of testosterone-fueled action sequels, but it comes up short when it comes to commercial bells and whistles. Sure there is some well-respected starpower, but comedy always sells better than drama with female-skewing pictures. And look for mothers to join their kids for \"Ratatouille\" which take many in the target audience out of the picture. Opening nationally in 978 theaters, \"Evening\" might gross about $3M this weekend.\"Evening\"Last weekend’s top earner \"Evan Almighty\" wasn’t exactly explosive out of the gate. This weekend will be a tough one as well since Pixar will steal away the family audience and John McClane will take away his share of summer moviegoers too. A 50% drop to about $15M would leave Universal with $60M after ten days.\"1408\" scared up some strong sales last weekend in its debut. But fright flicks fall hard on the second weekend so a 55% decline would give the John Cusack thriller around $9.5M for the frame and a ten-day cume of $39M.A similar fate could await \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" which tumbled by 66% in its sophomore session. Fox might drop down to roughly $9M boosting the 17-day total to $115M.LAST YEAR: Warner Bros. flew into the top spot with the ultraexpensive comic flick \"Superman Returns\" which bowed to a not-so-muscular $52.5M over three days and $84.6M in its first five days. The Man of Steel made its way to $200.1M domestically and $390M worldwide which fell below industry expectations. Exceeding pre-release expectations was Meryl Streep‘s \"The Devil Wears Prada\" which bowed to $27.5M for Fox. The sleeper hit went on to gross a surprisingly strong $124.7M in North America and did exceptionally well overseas too with a global tally of $325M. Rounding out the top five were Adam Sandler‘s \"Click\" with $19.9M, the Disney/Pixar hit \"Cars\" with $14.6M, and Jack Black‘s \"Nacho Libre\" with $6.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"FXX, foreign, Comics, scene, Paquin, doctor, Century, Adult, Comedy, japanese, Calendar, italian","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Rats-and-Bruce-Hit-Theaters-This-Weekend"},{"id":"47509154221118","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Shrek Inherits Box Office Crown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Shrek Inherits Box Office Crownby Gitesh Pandya | May 20, 2007 |  CommentsMovie fans came out in droves this weekend to see their favorite green ogre’s newest adventure as \"Shrek the Third\" easily captured the box office crown and broke the record for the biggest opening ever for an animated film.That sent the super hero saga \"Spider-Man 3\" down to the runnerup spot but the overall marketplace once again beat last year’s levels for the third straight weekend giving the summer movie season an explosive start.Executives at DreamWorks Animation and Paramount were drinking green champagne this weekend thanks to \"Shrek the Third\" which debuted to an astounding $122M, according to estimates, over the Friday-to-Sunday period and $122.9M since its early launch at 10pm on Thursday night in about 1,000 theaters. Invading 4,122 total locations, the PG-rated toon averaged a stunning $29,597 per cinema and surpassed the $108M bow of 2004’s \"Shrek 2\" which previously held the record for the biggest animated opening. That film, which was the first in history to break the 4,000-theater threshold, debuted on a Wednesday and captured $129M over its five-day premiere period. The next biggest toon opening is $70.5M for the 2004 Disney/Pixar vehicle \"The Incredibles\" which just shows how different the league that the \"Shrek\" franchise lives in is.\"Third\" also set new opening weekend records for both DreamWorks and Paramount beating \"Shrek 2\" and \"War of the Worlds\" ($64.9M), respectively. The ogre sequel also generated the third best opening of all-time trailing only \"Spider-Man 3\"’s $151.1M from earlier this month and \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest’s\" $135.6M from last July. That ranking should slip another spot next weekend after the new \"Pirates\" film sets sail.The new ogre sequel grossed $907,000 on Thursday from night-before showings beginning at 10pm, hauled in $38.5M on Friday (its true opening day), surged 22% to $47M on Saturday, and is estimated to dip 22% on Sunday to $36.5M. \"Shrek 2,\" which opened on the same exact weekend three years ago, also suffered a 22% Saturday-to-Sunday dip in its debut frame. The production budget on the new installment is estimated to be $160-170M.Reuniting the voice talents of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and Antonio Banderas, \"Shrek the Third\" adds some new characters including a teen would-be king voiced by Justin Timberlake. The slender 92-minute film was not very well-liked by critics and earned the worst reviews for the franchise just as \"Spider-Man 3\" did a couple of weeks ago. However, moviegoers again disregarded the critics and came out for some early summer fun dropping some mighty big bags of cash at multiplexes nationwide. \"Shrek\" dominated the attention of ticket buyers and accounted for about 70% of all sales for the Top 20.Studio research showed that Fiona’s hubby appealed to all audience segments becoming a true four-quadrant pic. Females made up 51% of the crowd and those over and under the age of 25 were evenly split. Teens, young adults, and families all came out in strong numbers. Those polled by CinemaScore gave the toon a B+ grade which is decent, but not spectacular. A fourth chapter of \"Shrek\" is already in development for a planned 2010 release.Dropping 51% in its third weekend was two-time box office champ \"Spider-Man 3\" with an estimated $28.5M. Sony’s webslinger sequel flew to $281.9M (including Imax grosses) from North America and averaged $6,591 from a record high 4,324 theaters. After 17 days, the Venom pic shot up to number 28 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters just ahead of \"The Matrix Reloaded\" which grossed $281.5M in 2003. Given its rate of erosion and upcoming competition from Captain Jack, the third webcrawler still looks on a course to conclude its domestic run with $340-350M.\"Spider-Man 3\" continues to rank number one in most international territories and grossed $49.6M overseas this weekend pushing its offshore cume to a scorching $465M and the global gross to a towering $747M. The latest Peter Parker tale has now become the top-grossing \"Spidey\" film overseas surpassing the $418M for the first film in 2002 and the $410M of \"Spider-Man 2\" in 2004. The third chapter has really taken off internationally as overseas box office accounts for 62% of the global tally. The first two super hero installments saw about 52% of their worldwide groesses come from outside of North America.Fox’s horror sequel \"28 Weeks Later\" dropped one spot to third place with an estimated $5.2M bringing the ten-day total to $18.6M. The well-reviewed virus thriller declined by 48% which is impressive for a fright flick. Still, \"Weeks\" looks to finish with about $30-32M or about one-third less than the $45.1M of 2003’s \"28 Days Later.\"Only scraps were left for the other films playing at multiplexes as the rest of the movies in the top ten attracted weekend ticket sales of less than $4M each. Three-time chart-topper \"Disturbia\" took in an estimated $3.7M, off only 22%, for a $71.3M cume for Paramount. The sleeper hit should find its way to around $80M.Universal’s Jane Fonda–Lindsay Lohan pic \"Georgia Rule\" dropped 48% to an estimated $3.5M in its second weekend pushing its ten-day total to a weak $12.6M. Look for a disappointing $20-22M final for the R-rated film which few have been showing interest in. New Line’s \"Fracture\" dipped just 17% to an estimated $2.5M putting the sum at $34.7M. A final tally of roughly $40M should result.The Lionsgate comedy \"Delta Farce\" followed its dismal bow with a troubling 46% fall to an estimated $1.8M this weekend for a miniscule total of $6.1M in ten days. It will try to limp to a $10M overall gross. Following in eighth place was Buena Vista’s \"The Invisible\" with an estimated $1.3M, down 44%, putting the cume at $17.7M. The supernatural thriller will probably end up with about $21M. British import \"Hot Fuzz\" continued to have good legs dipping only 27% to an estimated $1.3M pushing the total to $21.1M. Focus will try to get to $25M.Two very different films tied for tenth place with estimates of $1.1M a piece. Fox Searchlight enjoyed continued success with the expansion of the Keri Russell starrer \"Waitress\" which widened from 65 to 116 theaters for a solid $9,784 average serving up moviegoers in the top ten for the first time. That doubled the comedy’s cume to $2.2M. This Friday, \"Waitress\" will expand again to most markets across the country reaching over 500 theaters playing as an indie alternative to the mindless popcorn films of early summer. Paramount’s big-budget action flop \"Next\" fell 35% giving the Nicolas Cage actioner an embarrassing $16.6M to date. A $19M final seems likely.Tumbling out of the top ten this weekend was Disney’s animated comedy \"Meet the Robinsons\" which fell a steep 71% thanks to the ogre’s arrival to an estimated $521,000. The G-rated toon has grossed $95.3M after its eighth weekend and may be headed for a $97M finish.Meanwhile in just two theaters, Fox Searchlight saw a powerful debut for its musical romance \"Once\" which grossed an estimated $60,511 for a sizzling $30,256 per site. Showered with praise from critics, the R-rated film premieres in eleven new cities on Friday.Yari Film Group had a mild debut for its ensemble drama \"Even Money\" which bowed to an estimated $26,013 from six playdates for a not-so-impressive $4,336 average.The top ten films grossed an estimated $170.8M which was up 12% from last year when \"The Da Vinci Code\" opened at number one with $77.1M; and up 10% from 2005 when \"Star Wars Episode III\" debuted on top with $108.4M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Century","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Shrek-Inherits-Box-Office-Crown"},{"id":"47509154211900","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Knocked Up\" Expecting Solid Arrival","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Knocked Up\" Expecting Solid Arrivalby Gitesh Pandya | May 31, 2007 |  CommentsCall it the weekend of the actor/producer. Three new films with stars that do double duty behind the scenes (or have good agents that can snag a free credit) enter a marketplace filled with big-budget tentpole pics quickly eroding away.Seth Rogen headlines and executive produces the new comedy \"Knocked Up,\" Kevin Costner stars and produces the crime thriller \"Mr. Brooks,\" and Elisabeth Shue acts in and co-produces the sports drama \"Gracie.\" Following an explosive May at the box office, the first weekend of June should see ticket sales calm down a bit before George and Brad usher in the next big wave of sequels.For adult moviegoers sick of pirates, ogres, and webslingers, Universal has the answer – the raunchy romantic comedy \"Knocked Up.\" The R-rated film from Judd Apatow (\"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\") stars Rogen and Katherine Heigl as a stoner loser and a just-promoted entertainment newswoman, respectively, who share a one night stand which leads to an unplanned pregnancy. Older teens, young adults, and couples make up the target audience here and the studio is hoping to bring back the same folks that opened \"Virgin\" to $21.4M on its way to a stellar $109.3M (five times its debut) two summers ago.With mindless popcorn sequels dominating the marquees for the past month, \"Knocked Up\" brings a breath of fresh air into the multiplexes. Moviegoers looking for new characters and new situations will be pleased. The marketing push has been strong but television spots are not too funny, mostly because the bulk of the humor is too racy to feature on broadcast television. But when opening weekend audiences find out how much funnier the actual film is compared to the trailer and commercials, red hot word-of-mouth will keep the pic playing week after week.The public’s appetite for studio comedies has been healthy over the last six months with \"Wild Hogs,\" \"Night at the Museum,\" \"Blades of Glory,\" and \"Norbit\" selling an amazing $626M worth of ticket stubs combined. \"Hogs\" even popped back into the top ten last weekend in its thirteenth session signaling the hunger in the marketplace right now for something good that will make people laugh. Universal enjoys going after adults on the weekend after Memorial Day. In 2005 it debuted the serious Russell Crowe–Renee Zellweger boxing pic \"Cinderella Man\" to $18.3M while last year the studio exceeded expectations with the $39.2M bow of the date flick \"The Break-Up.\" \"Knocked Up\" should play to much of the same audience as the Jennifer Aniston film, although with less starpower and no tabloid gossip about the star’s personal lives, the grosses won’t soar as high.Critics have been praising \"Knocked Up\" and its strong cross-gender appeal will make it a hit with the date crowd. A unique concept and a great title will also help sell the film. \"Pirates\" will only be in its second weekend and will still be pulling in a broad audience so there will be some competition. But \"Knocked Up\" has great buzz and will start selling itself after people begin pouring out of the Friday night shows. Opening in 2,873 theaters, the Universal release may gross about $24M this weekend and witness small declines in the weeks ahead.\"Yay, pregnancy.\"Less than a year after co-starring with Ashton Kutcher in \"The Guardian,\" Kevin Costner teams up with the \"Punk’d\" star’s gal pal Demi Moore in the new psychological thriller \"Mr. Brooks.\" In the R-rated film, the former bodyguard plays a family man who moonlights as a serial killer while the ex-G.I. Jane stars as a detective hot on his trail. The MGM release should play to the oldest audience of any major release out now. That’s a good thing since direct competition will not be too fierce. But despite some moderately good reviews, Brooks is anchored by two aging actors who were bulletproof box office stars fifteen years ago, but are not all that reliable at the turnstiles nowadays.\"Knocked Up\" has much more buzz around it and will take away much of the thirtysomething crowd, but the forty-plus audience might give \"Mr. Brooks\" a try. Older adults did little for \"Georgia Rule\" which bowed to just $6.8M but April’s \"Fracture\" had a decent $11M opening. Costner should draw an audience more like the one that came out for the Anthony Hopkins thriller. The marketing push has not been too forceful so a large turnout is not likely. Invading 2,453 theaters, \"Mr. Brooks\" may generate a $9M debut.Where Dane Cook gets his career advice.Picturehouse targets the Lady Foot Locker crowd with its new drama \"Gracie\" which tells the true story of a teenage girl in the late 1970s who fought to play competitive soccer when the sport did not open its doors to her gender. The PG-13 flick stars Dermot Mulroney, Elisabeth Shue, and Carly Schroeder and has been marketed squarely to its core audience of teenage girls. \"Gracie\" is unlikely to score any goals with other audience segments and is not being released in too many theaters so a modest opening is likely. Reviews have been mixed. Kicking its way into about 1,000 locations, \"Gracie\" might find itself with an opening weekend take of around $3M.The mullet-headed heckler is always an important training component.Fox Searchlight invades the arthouses once again with its Russian fantasy epic \"Day Watch,\" the sequel to Timur Bekmambetov‘s \"Night Watch\" which became a mammoth blockbuster in its home country in 2004. Last year, \"Night Watch\" bowed in the U.S. to a sturdy $35,475 average from only three theaters and eventually collected $1.5M from 158 sites. \"Day Watch\" continues the battle of Light vs. Darkness in an adventure set in Moscow with digital effects that could rival any $200M-budgeted Hollywood tentpole pic. The R-rated film debuts on Friday in New York and Los Angeles with two theaters in each city plus a solo house in San Francisco. More markets across the country will be added in the weeks ahead.\"Day Watch\"None of the newbies looks like first-place material so \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" should easily retain its box office crown. However, a substantial fall is likely. As a third part of a franchise coming off of a big holiday bow, the drop would of course be large. \"Dead Man’s Chest\" fell by 54% in its sophomore frame. Add in the fact that fan reaction isn’t exactly stellar and the ship should sink by a large amount. Don’t expect the latest \"Pirates\" to suffer the 67% crash that the third \"X-Men\" flick saw a year ago when it came off of the Memorial Day frame. Instead, it could perform more like 2004’s \"The Day After Tomorrow\" which fell 60% coming off of the same holiday weekend. Luckily for Johnny Depp and pals the competition is not too fierce this weekend. A similar 60% tumble would give \"At World’s End\" about $46M worth of weekend loot which would boost the ten-day cume to $218M.\"Shrek the Third\" will also not have much in the way of competition for its family audience, but comedy fans will certainly abandon ship and head for \"Knocked Up.\" The ogre franchise makes a sizable portion of its money from teens and young adults and those folks are going to be moving on. Last weekend’s 56% drop was affected by the arrival of \"Pirates.\" This weekend, it could stabilize and fall by 45%. That would give \"Shrek the Third\" around $29M for the weekend and $256M after 17 days.\"Spider-Man 3,\" the only May threequel with the actual number three in its title, has also been fading away. A 45% drop would give the Sandman saga roughly $8M boosting the cume to $319M.LAST YEAR: Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn proved more popular than super heroes as their romantic comedy \"The Break-Up\" knocked \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" out of the number one spot in only its second weekend. The Universal comedy opened to $39.2M on its way to a better-than-expected $118.7M. The mutant sequel tumbled 67% to $34M in its sophomore frame for the runnerup position. Paramount’s toon sensation \"Over the Hedge\" held up well in third with $20.6M followed by \"The Da Vinci Code\" with $18.6M and \"Mission: Impossible III\" with $4.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"kids, school, Comic, Netflix, Yoda, potter, Tumblr, concert, Musicals, boxing","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Knocked-Up-Expecting-Solid-Arrival"},{"id":"47509074807114","title":"Video Interviews with the Cast &amp; Crew of Man of Steel","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video Interviews with the Cast &amp; Crew of Man of SteelHenry Cavill, Amy Adams, Russell Crowe, Michael Shannon, and Zack Snyderby Grae Drake | June 13, 2013 |  CommentsThe summer blockbuster you’ve been waiting for is finally flying into theaters, to save your summer from its descent into heat and boredom.

Ashley Judd is set to take in a little less cash with the long weekend’s other new nationwide release, the horror film \"Bug.\" And with holdovers like \"Shrek the Third\" in its second round and \"Spider-Man 3\" in its fourth spin, the North American box office will expand greatly as moviegoers may just spend all their free time at the local moviehouse.Hysterical anticipation for the return of Captain Jack Sparrow will help Disney become a much richer studio. After the cliffhanger ending of last summer’s \"Dead Man’s Chest,\" \"At World’s End\" is ready to bring all those fans back once again for another ticket purchase. Its spot at the top of the charts this weekend, and probably next weekend too, is guaranteed so the real question is will the new \"Pirates\" film break the all-time opening weekend record set just three weeks ago by \"Spider-Man 3\"?If the ultimate answer ends up being no, that won’t necessarily be a bad thing or anything to be disappointed by. \"At World’s End\" is having a different type of debut so it will not be an apples-to-apples comparison. Firstly, the new high seas adventure begins its run with 8pm shows on Thursday night which are being aggressively advertised. \"Dead Man’s Chest\" grossed a scorching $9M from its Thursday night shows which began at midnight so with the earlier time, the treasure chest will be much more full. But the night-before shows will pull millions of dollars of sales from hardcore fans out of the official weekend period of Friday-to-Sunday thus diluting the three-day take. \"Spider-Man 3\" began with midnight shows on Thursday night so those numbers were all concentrated within the official opening weekend tally.Also, \"At World’s End\" will face tremendous competiton, something Spidey did not have to deal with. The rest of the top five is likely to steal away over $80M during the three-day portion of the holiday weekend. For the latest webslinger’s bow, the next four films in the market made less than $16M. And although \"Pirates\" will secure thousands of screens, it will still enter a box office where close to 15,000 auditoriums will already be booked up with the third servings of \"Shrek\" and \"Spider-Man.\" It will be tougher for \"Pirates\" to land that sixth or seventh screen within a megaplex.But working in Sparrow’s favor is the Monday holiday which will make Sunday perform more like a Saturday which will certainly help its quest for new records. Also overall anticipation for the franchise seems to be higher than it was for Peter Parker. MovieTickets.com reported that advance sales for \"At World’s End\" is beating both \"Spider-Man 3\" and \"Dead Man’s Chest\" at the same point in their sales cycles. Plus \"Pirates\" has the highest female appeal for any action movie franchise out there which is a key contributor to its immense grosses. This one will bring in everyone and with all Americans having extra time off, there will be plenty of time for people to eventually find a showtime that’s not sold out.Reviews have been mixed for the latest \"Pirates\" and its running time with trailers is close to three hours. But the two biggest openings of all-time were also long pics at about two-and-a-half hours in length each without trailers so multiplexes will find a way to dump underperforming titles (and there are plenty to choose from) and make room for Davy Jones and his gang. Friday-to-Monday starts for those smashes were $161.4M for \"Spider-Man 3\" and $153.8M for \"Dead Man’s Chest.\" Seizing screens in over 4,000 theaters, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" might open to about $162M over four days and roughly $183M from Thursday to Monday.\"Hey Professor, what’s another word for pirate treasure?\"The daring folks at Lionsgate will open their own film nationally on Friday challenging the triumvirate of threequels. The horror flick \"Bug\" stars Ashley Judd as a lonely waitress who thinks that insects (spiders that bite teenage photographers maybe?) are out to get her. The R-rated film will try to court the fright crowd not interested in ahoy matey shenanigans, but will find an incredibly tough time floating in this weekend’s marketplace. There is nothing about \"Bug\" that tells fans that they should pay top dollar now instead of renting the DVD a mere three months down the road. Judd’s starpower has been on the decline for years. She’s not that hot star from \"Double Jeopardy\" anymore. And marketing the film as being from the director of \"The Exorcist\" will do little as well. Opening in 1,661 theaters, \"Bug\" might crawl to about $6M over four days.\"Bug,\" going for that coveted 4th spot in the weekend box office.Dropping to the runnerup spot with what could be one of the largest grosses ever for a second-place film will be the animated blockbuster \"Shrek the Third\" which is coming off of the third largest debut in box office history. \"Shrek 2\" had mostly the same release pattern in 2004 and saw its four-day Memorial Day weekend tally dip only 12% from its three-day opening weekend figure. The holiday is one of the busiest times for families at the multiplexes so kidpics typically hold up very well. As the third chapter in the series, audience erosion should be faster for the new ogre film. Plus with \"Pirates\" set to launch with such astonishing numbers, \"Shrek the Third\" can’t help but be pushed aside by the competition. Still a 35% drop would give Paramount a stunning $80M over four days and would make the 11-day total skyrocket to $230M.\"Spider-Man 3\" will drop another notch to third and should definitely see much of its audience get swiped by Depp and company given how much overlap there is between the audiences for the two franchises. \"X2: X-Men United,\" another Marvel super hero sequel that opened on the first weekend of May, saw its four-day Memorial Day weekend gross drop by only 24% in 2003 when \"Bruce Almighty\" was the new opener. \"Spider-Man 3\" has more direct action competition and less fan support so a larger decline is likely. The Venom flick could drop 35% and post a four-day gross of about $19M which would boost the webslinger’s cume to $308M.LAST YEAR: Mutants were all the rage as \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" towered over the competition with a record Memorial Day opening of $122.9M over four days. The Fox super hero saga went on to collect $234.4M domestically, making it the third biggest grosser of the summer, and over $455M worldwide. Tom Hanks ranked second with \"The Da Vinci Code\" which fell sharply but still took in $42.4M over the long holiday weekend for Sony. Paramount followed with the DreamWorks toon \"Over the Hedge\" with $35.3M in its sophomore round. Action entries \"Mission: Impossible III\" and \"Poseidon\" rounded out the top five with $8.9M and $7.1M, respectively.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Walt, cults, Television","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Pirates-Awaits-Massive-Holiday-Treasure"},{"id":"47509154228289","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"28 Weeks Later\" and \"Georgia Rule\" To Battle For #2 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"28 Weeks Later\" and \"Georgia Rule\" To Battle For #2 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | May 10, 2007 |  CommentsIn what must be a first at the box office, an aerobics queen takes on killer zombies in a vicious battle for the silver medal during what no doubt will be another mammoth weekend for \"Spider-Man 3.\"Fox unleashes its horror sequel \"28 Weeks Later,\" Universal counters with its femme-driven star vehicle \"Georgia Rule,\" Lionsgate tosses in the comedy \"Delta Farce,\" and MGM releases yet another laugher with \"The Ex.\" Meanwhile, back in New York City, the webslinger will attempt to swing to a massive quarter-billion-dollar cume by the end of its second weekend.As the second of ten sequels hitting theaters over the May-June corridor, \"28 Weeks Later\" is the follow-up to the cult hit zombie chiller \"28 Days Later\" which lit up theaters four years ago. Danny Boyle shifts from the director’s chair to the executive producer’s office as Juan Carlos Fresnadillo takes the helm. \"Days\" was very well-received which explains why a sequel was greenlit. In the new installment, the killer virus infects people once again as London tries to repopulate and madness ensues. The built-in audience will help the R-rated \"Weeks\" right out of the gate.Its predecessor bowed to $10.1M from only 1,260 theaters for a potent $7,986 average on its way to a solid $45.1M final. Through video and cable, it found an even larger fan base and many will give \"Weeks\" a try. However working against it is of course competition from \"Spider-Man 3\" which has a hold on fans of comics and sci-fi. Plus 2007 has seen 1,001 horror films flood theaters causing recent fright fatigue. Casual fans of scary movies may pass on \"Weeks\" if they’re trying to stay away from blood and gore. Fox’s marketing has been clever and effective and the target audience is excited. Plus reviews have been very positive which will help a bit too since most horror films nowadays are either not screened for critics in advance or earn poor marks. Attacking over 2,000 theaters, \"28 Weeks Later\" might scare up around $13M this weekend.\"28 Weeks Later\"For those looking to avoid zombies and super heroes in their weekend entertainment, Universal offers the dramedy \"Georgia Rule\" starring Jane Fonda, Lindsay Lohan, and Felicity Huffman. The R-rated story tells of a teenage girl dumped at her grandmother’s house for the summer by her alcoholic mother which leads to the uncovering of family secrets. Just in time for Mother’s Day weekend, \"Georgia\" will play almost exclusively to women as men will have to be dragged against their will. However, moviegoers from a broad age group should turn out since the cast boasts stars of different generations. The one troublespot could be the rating though. Lohan arguably still has pull with teenage girls who may be left out because of the MPAA’s tag. But the film’s two uses of the F word are essential to the story as are the adult themes so the R was unavoidable.\"Georgia Rule\" should play to the same audience that the studio saw for previous chick flicks like Diane Keaton‘s \"Because I Said So\" ($13.1M opening, $5,195 average), Meryl Streep‘s \"Prime\" ($6.2M, $3,405), and Debra Messing‘s \"The Wedding Date\" ($11.1M, $6,566). Reaching the $23.1M debut of Fonda’s last film \"Monster-in-Law\" is not likely however since it won’t crossover into other demographic groups like the J. Lo pic did. The weekend’s new releases will not provide too much competition which means that the universal appeal of the webslinger sequel will be the main enemy. Bad reviews will eat into sales from mature adults, but many from the \"Desperate Housewives\" crowd will still make a trip out to this chick flick. \"Georgia Rule\" enters 2,523 theaters on Friday and could walk away with about $13M.\"Georgia Rule\"Larry the Cable Guy stars in the new military comedy \"Delta Farce\" which also hits theaters on Friday. The PG-13 film from Lionsgate finds three hapless men being mistaken for Army recruits who are sent to Iraq but mistakenly dropped in Mexico. Not since \"Best Defense\" has a film of this type been such an unwelcome entry in the marketplace. Young males are the only group likely to show interest and with Spidey in only his second swing, few will find this new comedy worth paying top dollar for. Plus starpower is lacking and none of the cast members are known for anchoring box office hits. Larry’s self-titled film last spring bowed to just $6.9M and this one will probably slump even lower. Opening in about 1,800 locations, \"Delta Farce\" will probably shoot up around $4M.\"Delta Farce\"Zach Braff and Amanda Peet play a thirtysomething New York couple with a new baby in the new romantic comedy \"The Ex\" marketed by The Weinstein Company and distributed by MGM. In the PG-13 pic, the likable duo moves to Ohio where Braff’s character gets a job at her father’s ad agency where he butts heads with his wife’s former fling from high school. Jason Bateman, Charles Grodin, and Donal Logue co-star. \"The Ex\" will be targeting the date crowd and young women, but will have rough sailing. \"Georgia Rule\" will already be tapping into the female moviegoing base and Spidey is attracting his share of women and young adults too. The promotional push has not been too forceful either so the film may end up with just the die-hard \"Scrubs\" fans. Mixed reviews won’t help either. Also, Braff and Peet are not box office anchors who sell lots of tickets. Sure \"Garden State\" was an indie hit with $26.8M in 2004, but that was a word-of-mouth platform release that made its money over time and not a commercial Hollywood comedy. Debuting in 1,009 theaters, \"The Ex\" might gross roughly $3M this weekend.\"The Ex\"None of these new films will come close to defeating the mighty \"Spider-Man 3\" which will enjoy its second comfortable box office win in a row. But a steep fall is likely. The first webslinger flick opened at the beginning of May five years ago and dropped by only 38% on the second weekend which was phenomenal. But like most sequels, especialy third-parters, \"Spider-Man 3\" attracted so much of its total audience upfront that rapid erosion is assured. The previous record-holder for the biggest opening weekend, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest,\" fell by 54% in its second adventure last July while its summer counterpart \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" tumbled by a troubling 67% in its sophomore frame. Of course that was coming off of a Memorial Day holiday opening so the decline was larger than normal.\"Spider-Man 3\" has already been taking a hit during the week dropping to $10.3M on Monday and $8M on Tuesday. Those numbers come close to what \"The Matrix Reloaded\" took in on the same days after its colossal opening weekend in mid-May 2003. That sci-fi pic crashed 60% in its second weekend despite its sophomore frame being helped by a holiday. Luckily for the Sandman flick the competition this weekend will not be too menacing. \"Spider-Man 3\" could still fall by more than 55% to about $65M this weekend which would boost the domestic haul to a mammoth $247M in only ten days.LAST YEAR: Tom Cruise topped the charts with \"Mission Impossible: III\" which dropped 48% in its second weekend to $25M. Opening in second place was the pricey disaster film \"Poseidon\" which debuted to $22.2M for Warner Bros. on its way to a disappointing $60.7M domestically. Worldwide, the Kurt Russell starrer grossed $182M. Robin Williams placed third with \"RV\" which eased by less than 10% to $10M in its third weekend. Lindsay Lohan stumbled into fourth with her new comedy \"Just My Luck\" which opened to a weak $5.7M on its way to $17.3M for Fox. Rounding out the top five was the horror flick \"An American Haunting\" with $3.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"demand, Go","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-28-Weeks-Later-and-Georgia-Rule-To-Battle-For-2-Spot"},{"id":"47509157160020","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ghost Rider Smokes Rivals During Record Presidents’ Day Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ghost Rider Smokes Rivals During Record Presidents' Day Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | February 19, 2007 |  CommentsHollywood studios opened five new wide releases targeting different audiences and were rewarded with a record-breaking Presidents’ Day holiday weekend tally as moviegoers opened their wallets and spread their cash across a variety of films. The comic book actioner \"Ghost Rider\" led the way with an explosive debut while the family drama \"Bridge to Terabithia\" was a solid performer in the runnerup spot.The quintet of freshman films pumped in more than $100M of new business over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the long weekend as the top ten soared to the highest gross in box office history during the January-to-April span.Nicolas Cage led the bustling box office and set a new career high in the process with \"Ghost Rider\" which opened at number one grossing an estimated $44.5M over three days doubling the performance of its nearest competitor. Averaging a scorching $12,296 from an ultrawide release in 3,619 locations, the Sony smash based on the popular Marvel Comics character outgunned the $35.1M bow of \"National Treasure,\" Cage’s previous best opening. The studio reported a preliminary four-day estimate for \"Ghost Rider\" of $51M over the extended Friday-to-Monday holiday span.The PG-13 film performed much like director Mark Steven Johnson‘s last film, 2003’s \"Daredevil,\" which was also based on a Marvel Comics character and launched over the same holiday frame. That Ben Affleck vehicle bowed to $40.3M over three days and $45M over four days which at today’s ticket prices would be almost identical to the \"Ghost\" numbers. Cage’s new motorcycle actioner will also set a new opening weekend record for the Washington-Lincoln holiday session beating the $45.1M four-day launch of the studio’s own \"50 First Dates\" from 2004.Fanboys as expected powered \"Ghost Rider\" to its stellar grosses. Sony research indicated that an exceptionally high 62% of the turnout was male while 55% was under the age of 25. The effects-driven pic accounted for one-third of all ticket sales within the top ten and posted the largest opening of any film over the last six months.Finishing the weekend in second place was Disney’s \"Bridge to Terabithia\" which collected an estimated $22.1M worth of ticket stubs over the Friday-to-Sunday period. The PG-rated fantasy about two seventh graders who imagine a magical wonderland to escape to averaged a sturdy $7,032 from 3,139 theaters. Earning strong reviews from critics, \"Bridge\" was adapted from the popular novel and played to younger children and their parents.Last weekend’s number one flick \"Norbit\" fell 51% in its second weekend which considering all the new competition was a decent hold for the Eddie Murphy comedy. The Paramount release collected an estimated $16.8M over three days and lifted its ten-day cume to a solid $58.9M. The studio also reported a preliminary four-day estimate of $20.6M which would send the 11-day cume to $62.7M. \"Norbit\" marked the best ten-day start for a Murphy live-action picture since 2000’s summer hit \"Nutty Professor II: The Klumps\" which took in $76.7M by the end of its second weekend on its way to $123.3M.Opening in fourth place with an estimated $14M was the Hugh Grant–Drew Barrymore romantic comedy \"Music and Lyrics.\" The Warner Bros. release about a washed up 80s singer who falls for a plant waterer averaged a respectable $4,738 from 2,955 locations and took in $19.5M since debuting on Wednesday for Valentine’s Day. Reviews were mixed for the PG-13 film and the three-day gross was similar to the opening of Grant’s 2002 hit \"Two Weeks Notice\" ($14.3M) and a bit better than Barrymore’s \"Fever Pitch\" which bowed to $12.4M two years ago. In its second weekend in the U.K., \"Music\" slipped only 17% and has grossed $10.5M in that market thus far and $14.2M overall internationally.Lionsgate followed in fifth with another date film that bowed on the love holiday, Tyler Perry‘s \"Daddy’s Little Girls.\" The PG-13 pic grossed an estimated $12.1M from 2,111 theaters for a solid $5,732 average over three days. Since launching on Wednesday, the tale of an attorney who couples up with a single working class father has taken in $17.8M. The opening was a far cry from the debuts of the filmmaker’s recent comedy hits. Last February, \"Madea’s Family Reunion\" opened to $30M on its way to $63.3M while the previous year, \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\" opened to $21.9M before finishing with $50.4M. Both films were released by Lionsgate on the last weekend of February and starred Perry as the outrageous Madea character. \"Girls\" may have generated less audience interest without Perry on screen.Older adults lined up for the FBI thriller \"Breach\" which debuted better than expected with an estimated $10.4M from only 1,489 sites. The PG-13 film which stars Ryan Phillippe and Chris Cooper averaged a strong $6,965 per theater and earned good reviews. According to studio research from Universal, half of the audience was over the age of 50 and 52% of the crowd was female. The studio also reported a preliminary four-day estimate of $12.1M and $8,155 average.\"Hannibal Rising\" sank to seventh place in its second weekend tumbling 58% to an estimated $5.5M. With $22.2M in ten days, look for the MGM release to reach about $30M. Universal’s comedy \"Because I Said So\" followed with an estimated $5M, off 46%, for a $33.2M cume.Sony’s former number one \"The Messengers\" dropped 47% and scared up an estimated $3.8M giving the thriller a total of $30.5M. Fox’s Ben Stiller action-comedy \"Night at the Museum\" grossed an estimated $3.7M, down 36%, and lifted its tally to $237.3M becoming the first film to spend nine straight weekends in the top ten since last winter’s \"The Chronicles of Narnia.\" \"Night\" also climbed up to number 46 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters sandwiching itself between a pair of action-comedy hits from 1984 – \"Ghostbusters\" ($238.6M) and \"Beverly Hills Cop\" ($234.8M). Of course, ticket prices were much lower two decades ago so \"Night\" has sold fewer tickets.The top ten films grossed an estimated $137.8M over three days which was up a stunning 30% from last year when \"Eight Below\" opened at number one with $20.2M; and up a healthy 26% from 2005 when \"Hitch\" remained on top with $31.4M in its sophomore session.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Worst, BET, RT21, comedy, comic, justice, Captain, monsters, Swim, social, Studios","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ghost-Rider-Smokes-Rivals-During-Record-Presidents-Day-Weekend"},{"id":"47509157165141","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Ghost Rider Leads Gang of New Flicks","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Ghost Rider Leads Gang of New Flicksby Gitesh Pandya | February 15, 2007 |  CommentsFive new films, each targeting its own audience, cram into North American multiplexes giving moviegoers plenty of entertainment options over the four-day Presidents’ Day holiday weekend.Segregating the races on Wednesday’s Valentine’s Day holiday with competing romantic comedies, Warner Bros. bowed the Hugh Grant–Drew Barrymore starrer \"Music and Lyrics\" for white audiences while Lionsgate countered with Tyler Perry‘s \"Daddy’s Little Girls\" for black moviegoers. Adding to the overcrowded frame on Friday will be Sony’s comic book actioner \"Ghost Rider,\" Disney’s tween adventure \"The Bridge to Terabithia,\" and the FBI thriller \"Breach\" from Universal. Although studios jammed too many films into this particular frame, audience overlap seems minimal so the box office should easily expand to its largest size of the year finally beating 2006 levels.Johnny Blaze leads the way over the extended weekend as Nicolas Cage steps into the role of the Marvel Comics character in the big-budget actioner \"Ghost Rider.\" The PG-13 film is directed by Mark Steven Johnson whose \"Daredevil,\" another effects-driven action flick based on a B-level Marvel hero, topped the box office over the Presidents’ Day frame four years ago with a powerful $45M with Ben Affleck in the lead. Much of the same audience of young males and comic fans will be back, however moviegoers have since been subjected to endless super hero flicks so don’t be surprised if some take a pass this time. Sony has been loud in its marketing campaign and awareness is sky high with the target audience. A crowded marketplace could keep the grosses in check. But with the most theaters of any new release by far, the motorcycle pic should ride off with the box office crown with ease. \"Ghost Rider\" opens in 3,619 theaters on Friday and could collect around $35M over the four-day span.Nicolas Cage in \"Ghost Rider\"Disney goes after the always reliable family audience with the fantasy drama \"The Bridge to Terabithia,\" a film adaptation of the beloved book. In the PG-rated tale, a seventh grade boy befriends the new girl who moves in next door and together create a fantasy world through their imaginations as an escape from the struggles of real life. Kidpics based on books usually find themselves with a built-in audience showing up on opening weekend and with \"Terabithia\" launching over a school holiday session, the target audience will be very available. Last year, the studio won the weekend going after a similar crowd with \"Eight Below\" which opened to a solid $25M over four days. \"Bridge\" lacks big star names, but should still pull in families especially since that segment has few other titles in the current marketplace to be excited about. Younger teens may however get pulled away by the crude physical comedy of \"Norbit\" or the comic book action of \"Ghost Rider.\" Launching in over 2,800 theaters, \"The Bridge to Terabithia\" may gross around $18M over the Friday-to-Monday period.\"The Bridge to Terabithia\"Following up his number one hits \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\" and \"Madea’s Family Reunion,\" Tyler Perry returns to the big screen with his latest comedy, \"Daddy’s Little Girls.\" The PG-13 film stars Gabrielle Union as an attorney who falls for a working class driver who has three daughters. Unlike his last two February chart-toppers, \"Girls\" finds Perry strictly behind the camera and not playing the outrageous matriarch Madea.In recent years, nobody has proven the power of the African American audience more than Perry who exceeded industry expectations both times with the $21.9M bow of \"Diary\" and the stronger $30M debut of \"Reunion\" a year ago. Both debuted on the weekend after the Presidents’ Day frame. Lionsgate once again handles distribution duties, but various factors indicate that sales should deflate a bit. Starpower is less for \"Girls,\" most notably because of Perry’s absence. Plus competition will be much tougher than in past years with \"Norbit\" in its second weekend playing to much of the same audience. However, the Tyler name sells and sell-outs are sure to occur in all parts of the country. Opening Wednesday in 2,111 theaters, \"Daddy’s Little Girls\" could take in about $16M over four days and $23M over six days.Tyler Perry’s \"Daddy’s Little Girls\"Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore find love in the new romantic comedy \"Music and Lyrics\" which also opened on Wednesday to capture the date crowd on Valentine’s Day. On paper, the PG-13 film has all the ingredients to become a box office hit thanks to the starpower and timing of its release. But a poor script and lack of chemistry could impact weekend grosses if mid-week ticket buyers spread bad word of mouth. Both actors are proven draws at the turnstiles and their first pairing will undoubtedly spark interest from women and couples. Warner Bros. has been pushing the 80’s music angle since Grant plays the washed up half of a pop music superduo from that era. Competition for white women over 25 is not too fierce among the weekend’s other contenders so a strong start is likely. Composing tunes in 2,929 locations, \"Music and Lyrics\" may find itself with around $16M over four days and about $22M over six days.Hugh Grant, in a sadly realistic portrayal of an 80s popstar, in \"Music and Lyrics.\"Ryan Phillippe stars as a young FBI agent out to catch his boss who has been selling secrets to the Soviet Union in the new political thriller \"Breach.\" The PG-13 pic co-stars Chris Cooper, Laura Linney, and Dennis Haysbert and is being released by Universal. Three factors will prevent big grosses for Reese’s ex-hubby. \"Breach\" lacks starpower, has too much competition to face, and is not being booked in too many theaters. Though the cast features some respected actors, none is a box office anchor that can draw in large paying crowds. Plus with four other new films hitting the multiplexes, and a collection of acclaimed Oscar contenders all attracting the attention of serious-minded adults, \"Breach\" cannot stand out. Academy pics may all be grossing small numbers individually, but moviegoers spent nearly $20M on the ones in the Top 20 last weekend and this long holiday frame will be the last full weekend to catch up on the contenders. Opening in just 1,487 theaters, \"Breach\" might steal about $7M over the four days.\"Breach,\" with Chris Cooper, Ryan Phillippe, and some blurry guy.Among holdovers, Oscar nominee Eddie Murphy may get driven out of the top spot by Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage. Both of their new films, of course, are for commercial gain and not critical acclaim. \"Norbit\" will be coming off of a solid opening, but will face competition from many of the new releases. The four-day gross could slide 30% from last weekend’s three-day opening and reach roughly $24M for the frame. That would give the Paramount release a terrific $64M in 11 days. A larger drop is in the works for \"Hannibal Rising.\" The MGM release may fall 40% to about $8M for a cume of $23M after a similar 11 days.LAST YEAR: The battle for Presidents’ Day weekend was won by the family adventure \"Eight Below\" which debuted on top with $25M over the four-day frame. Disney’s hit kids flick went on to collect $81.6M. Fox settled for second with its spoof comedy \"Date Movie\" which bowed to $21.8M over the Friday-to-Monday period on its way to $48.5M. \"The Pink Panther\" dropped from first to third with $20.9M followed by fellow kidpic \"Curious George\" with $15.4M. Rounding out the top five was \"Final Destination 3\" with $11.5M. Samuel L. Jackson flopped with his new drama \"Freedomland\" which debuted to just $6.7M over four days leading to a weak $12.5M final for Sony.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Reality, telelvision, Showtime, dramedy, hispanic, movies, competition, kong, jamie, Funimation, comedies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Ghost-Rider-Leads-Gang-of-New-Flicks"},{"id":"47509157168214","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers Rush Out for Double Dose of Eddie","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers Rush Out for Double Dose of Eddieby Gitesh Pandya | February 11, 2007 |  CommentsEddie Murphy scored the 14th number one hit of his career this weekend by playing three eccentric characters in the new comedy \"Norbit,\" which generated the largest opening of any film this year by far.Debuting far back in second place with less than half the ticket sales was the revenge thriller \"Hannibal Rising.\" With the Academy Awards just two weeks away, many moviegoers caught up on the major nominees which all displayed fantastic holds. The explosive \"Norbit\" bow, however, was not enough to keep the box office from dipping below year-ago levels for the sixth consecutive weekend.Returning to the type of crude comedy that launched his career over a quarter-century ago, Eddie Murphy proved once again how strong of a box office draw he still is with \"Norbit\" which opened in the top spot with a very strong $33.7M, according to estimates. The PG-13 film, which was written by the comedian and his older brother Charlie Murphy, averaged a sizzling $10,759 from 3,136 theaters. Eddie Murphy also saw his Oscar-nominated turn in \"Dreamgirls\" sit in the top ten at the number nine spot. Both films were produced by DreamWorks and distributed by its new owner Paramount.\"Norbit,\" which finds the former \"Saturday Night Live\" star playing a skinny timid man as well as his outrageous and overweight wife, gave Murphy his biggest opening for a live-action film since 2000’s \"Nutty Professor II: The Klumps\" which bowed to $42.5M in July of that year. That comedy also found the star putting on latex fat suits to play other characters. For DreamWorks, \"Norbit\" represented the studio’s third biggest live action opening ever and second largest for a non-sequel following the $34.8M of 2000’s \"Gladiator.\"Critics trashed \"Norbit,\" but then again the target audience for this kind of comedy would never care about reviews anyway. The Murphy brand name plus effective marketing sold this movie and a broad audience turned out. Plus the actor has not been seen in these kinds of comedies in many years prompting a healthy appetite from fans. African Americans and Latinos were especially responsible for the stellar business. Budgeted in the vicinity of $65M, the battered husband pic should utilize the upcoming Valentine’s Day and Presidents’ Day holidays to help keep the tickets selling. That would allow \"Norbit\" to join \"Dreamgirls\" as the 12th and 13th $100M blockbusters of Eddie Murphy’s career with this May’s \"Shrek the Third\" set to become number fourteen after its first few days of release.The return of screen villain Hannibal Lecter was not met with as much enthusiam. The prequel story \"Hannibal Rising\" debuted in second place with an estimated $13.4M from 3,003 theaters. Averaging a decent $4,446 per venue, the R-rated thriller about Lecter’s younger years and the revenge he sought upon those who killed his sister was marketed by The Weinstein Co. and distributed by MGM. The gross was less than half the $36.5M bow of the last film in the series, 2002’s \"Red Dragon\" which starred Anthony Hopkins in his final turn as the famed cannibal. \"Hannibal Rising\" may have opened on the exact same day of the year as 2001’s blockbuster \"Hannibal,\" but the grosses could not have been more different. That Hopkins starrer shattered the February opening weekend record with a summer-like $58M launch. Reviews were mostly negative for the new installment.Despite atrocious reviews, Diane Keaton‘s mother-daughter comedy \"Because I Said So\" held up very well in its second weekend slipping only 31% to an estimated $9M. That gave the Universal release a decent $25.6M in ten days and could put the film on track to reach about $50M. Fellow sophomore \"The Messengers\" dropped from first to fourth place in its second scare grossing an estimated $7.2M. Falling a steep 51%, the $16M thriller has banked $24.7M in ten days and should conclude in the neighborhood of $35M.Ben Stiller‘s \"Night at the Museum\" enjoyed its eighth consecutive weekend in the top five and grossed an estimated $5.8M slipping a mere 10%. Despite the new star-driven comedy on the block, audiences still made time for the adventure pic which this weekend joined the list of the top 50 domestic blockbusters of all-time. \"Museum\" saw its cume rise to $232.1M putting it at number 50 just behind the $233.6M of another Fox holiday blockbuster, 2000’s \"Cast Away.\"Fox’s spoof comedy \"Epic Movie\" dropped 47% to an estimated $4.5M and bumped its cume up to $35.5M. Universal’s crime thriller \"Smokin’ Aces\" ranked seventh with an estimated $3.8M, down 38%, for a $30.9M total.A trio of Oscar contenders rounded out the top ten. \"Pan’s Labyrinth,\" the fairy tale for adults, continued showing superb legs and dipped just 4% to an estimated $3.5M. With $26.6M in sales thus far, the Picturehouse release has more than doubled its gross since earning six Academy Award nominations and is still expanding into more markets as solid word-of-mouth spreads.Eddie Murphy’s second film in the top ten was \"Dreamgirls\" which slipped 23% to an estimated $3.1M. Paramount has collected $97.1M to date and is a week away from joining the century club. American subjects were still flocking to \"The Queen\" which eased only 5% to an estimated $2.5M lifting the cume to a stellar $49M.A pair of Sony hits fell out of the top ten over the weekend. The Will Smith blockbuster \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" grossed an estimated $2.4M, down only 19%, and pushed its sum to $160.5M. The homelessness drama is Smith’s sixth consecutive $100M+ hit and tenth career blockbuster overall. His last six smashes together have grossed nearly $2 billion worldwide. \"Pursuit,\" which earned its star an Oscar nod for best actor, could end its domestic run with close to $170M.Sony’s $14M step dancing drama \"Stomp the Yard\" also took in an estimated $2.4M this weekend and boosted its incredible tally to $59.1M. Off 41%, a $65M final seems likely.The top ten films grossed an estimated $86.5M which was off 12% from last year when \"The Pink Panther\" opened at number one with $20.2M; and down 12% from 2005 as well when \"Hitch\" debuted on top with $43.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"movies, Amazon, Globe, Network, black, New, Emmy, TCM, Disney, Black, Access, TNT, wars, show, Mary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Moviegoers-Rush-Out-for-Double-Dose-of-Eddie"},{"id":"47509157202014","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Stomp\" Steps All Over New Releases","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Stomp\" Steps All Over New Releasesby Gitesh Pandya | January 15, 2007 |  CommentsStomping into the number one spot over the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend was the college dance drama \"Stomp the Yard,\" which grossed an estimated $22M in its opening weekend to push three-week champ \"Night at the Museum\" into second place. Exceeding even the loftiest of expectations, the PG-13 step dancing pic averaged a loud $10,726 from only 2,051 theaters.Over the past 22 months, only \"Borat\" has reached the top spot with fewer theaters. With Monday being a holiday, studios will release complete four-day weekend estimates then. \"Stomp the Yard\" was budgeted at only $14M and generated two-thirds of its business this weekend from African American moviegoers, according to studio research.After ruling the box office for three weeks, the effects-driven comedy \"Night at the Museum\" slipped to second place but still posted healthy numbers grossing an estimated $17.1M. Fox has now collected a hefty $185.8M and saw its weekend tally decline by only 28%. Sliding only 29% was Will Smith‘s Golden Globe-nominated turn in \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" with an estimated $9.1M in its fifth frame. Sony has banked $136.5M while the popular Museum-Pursuit duo has grossed a stunning $322M together.Paramount expanded its hit musical \"Dreamgirls\" from 852 to 1,907 theaters and climbed a notch into fourth place with an estimated $8.1M. Off only 6%, the DreamWorks production has taken in $65M thus far with the $100M mark expected to be broken in the near future. \"Dreamgirls\" is considered the frontrunner to win the Golden Globe award for Best Picture – Comedy or Musical on Monday night and is looking to secure several Oscar nominations next week which the studio hopes will allow the pic to have legs. But after four weeks of incredible averages, the PG-13 film saw its per-theater average slide to $4,259 from its nationwide release.The studio also expanded its urban high school drama \"Freedom Writers\" from 1,360 to 2,179 sites and ranked fifth with an estimated $7.1M. The gross dipped by only 24% for the Hilary Swank flick while the average tumbled by 53%. Total stands at $18.4M.Three of the top five films over MLK weekend featured predominantly African American casts while \"Freedom\" boasted a multicultural school saga. For the Hollywood film industry, it was a rare sight. However between the King frame and Black History Month, a handful of studios have discovered how to tap into the sizable African American moviegoing audience with the right films in the January-February corridor.Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón followed in sixth with his futuristic drama \"Children of Men\" which grossed an estimated $6.4M, down 37%, for a $21.4M total to date. The Clive Owen thriller was given 299 more theaters, but suffered a slowdown as its average dropped 49% in only its second weekend of wide play. \"Children\" has also grossed $32.5M overseas.Three new releases followed but ticket buyers were not too excited about any of them. The drug dealer drama \"Alpha Dog\" bowed in seventh place with an estimated $6.1M from 1,289 locations for a respectable $4,765 average. Justin Timberlake, who conveniently announced his breakup with Cameron Diaz just days before the film opened, stars in the ensemble cast of the R-rated drama.The serial killer pic \"Primeval\" debuted close behind in eighth place with an estimated $6M from 2,444 theaters. Despite having the widest release in the freshman class, the R-rated chiller averaged a weak $2,450 for Buena Vista. MGM released The Weinstein Company’s kidpic \"Arthur and the Invisibles\" but bombed with an estimated $4.3M from 2,247 playdates for a poor $1,914 average. The PG-rated adventure featured both live action and animation plus featured the voices of Madonna, Snoop Dogg, and Robert De Niro. Audiences had no interest.Rounding out the top ten was De Niro’s spy thriller \"The Good Shepherd\" with an estimated $3.9M, down 39%, for a $54.3M cume.Sony Classics widened its Chinese historical epic \"Curse of the Golden Flower\" from 55 sites in limited release to 1,234 theaters nationwide and collected an estimated $2M. That gave the Zhang Yimou drama a flimsy average of only $1,624 with a total to date of $4.4M. Moviegoers were more in the mood for dancers stomping than daggers flying.The top ten films grossed an estimated $90.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday period which was off 3% from last year when \"Glory Road\" opened at number one with $13.6M; and down 20% from 2005 when \"Coach Carter\" debuted on top with $24.2M over three days.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"worst, batman, reboot, RT, Western, on, Worst, Teen, cinemax","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Stomp-Steps-All-Over-New-Releases"},{"id":"47509158711407","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: New Pics Challenge \"Borat’s\" Mandate","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: New Pics Challenge \"Borat's\" Mandateby Gitesh Pandya | November 9, 2006 |  CommentsThis weekend, multiplexes hope to cram in lots of moviegoers thanks to a wide selection of new films. Six movies open or expand nationally on Friday making for what will be one of the most competitive weekends of the holiday season.Adult audiences looking for a laugh can see Will Ferrell in a more mature role in \"Stranger Than Fiction.\" The female vote will be split with daughters going for a scare with Sarah Michelle Gellar in \"The Return\" while their mothers can spend the evening with Russell Crowe in the romantic comedy \"A Good Year.\" The action flick \"Harsh Times\" rounds out the menu of new releases targeting young men.In addition, the cross-continent drama \"Babel\" expands across the country after two weeks of stellar results in limited release. Despite all the new opponents entering the field, reigning box office incumbent \"Borat\" will go fully national in an attempt to be re-elected for a second term as commander-in-chief. Rarely does a November weekend have so many new offerings. The fight for screens and moviegoer attention will be fierce. Not every film will survive so some casualties will be left behind on the battlefield by the end of the frame.After battling Sacha Baron Cohen with race cars last summer in \"Talladega Nights,\" Will Ferrell once again takes on the British comedian at the box office with \"Stranger Than Fiction\" which will try to stop the seemingly unstoppable \"Borat\" machine. In the PG-13 film, the funnyman plays an agent with the IRS who begins to hear a voice narrating his life and his every move. Emma Thompson provides the voice while Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, and Queen Latifah co-star. Directed by Marc Forster (\"Finding Neverland,\" \"Monster’s Ball\"), \"Stranger\" takes an A-list comedian and puts him in a more mature and serious film that still has some comedic elements. That means that the 14-year-old boys who powered \"Talladega Nights\" to a $47M opening will take a pass this time around.When Jim Carrey went arthouse, he saw \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" open to $8.2M with a $6,042 average and \"Man on the Moon\" bow to $7.5M with a $3,615 average. Adam Sandler‘s \"Spanglish\" debuted to $8.8M and a $3,617 average. It can often be a tough sell to take a comedian known mostly for mainstream comedies and put him into a more mature film, even if it still has laughs. \"Stranger Than Fiction\" might find it difficult to pull in teens and young adults, but mature adults will have interest. Reviews have been generally good and the concept makes the film stand out in the current marketplace. Competition for adults will come from both \"Babel\" and \"A Good Year\" while \"Borat\" will continue to steal away millions of moviegoers looking for a good laugh. Launching in 2,264 theaters, \"Stranger Than Fiction\" might open with roughly $16M.Will Ferrell screaming at a bus in \"Stranger Than Fiction.\"Halloween may have passed but those in search of a scare, and were disappointed that \"The Grudge 2\" did not have Sarah Michelle Gellar in a full role, will have a chance to see their favorite vampire slayer in the new supernatural thriller \"The Return.\" With a commercially friendly PG-13 rating, the spookfest finds Gellar playing a young businesswoman guided by mysterious forces to avenge her own death from a previous life. In the horror genre, Gellar is a bonafide star and can pull in teens and young adults. But with so many fright sequels cramming into theaters recently during the pre-pumpkin period, many genre fans might be all scared out by now. Luckily for \"The Return,\" competition will not be too fierce as nothing else is exciting teenage girls at the moment. The marketing push has been decent, but in many ways it does not stand out as something special or unique that is worth seeing right away. Opening in 1,986 theaters, \"The Return\" might gross around $8M over the weekend.Sarah Michelle Gellar, padding her horror credentials in \"The Return.\"Russell Crowe reteams with his \"Gladiator\" director Ridley Scott for a trip to a new genre (romantic comedy) in \"A Good Year.\" The PG-13 film finds the former Maximus playing a financial guru who finds women and wine at a french vineyard he inherits. Talk about a tough sell. On paper, the Scott-Crowe combo is box office gold, only they chose to try out a type of film that will repel fans who spent $187.7M on the 2000 Best Picture Oscar winner. Plus the Fox release has no notable female star to boost its potential. Add to that the bad buzz that \"Year\" received at the Toronto Film Festival plus the mostly negative reviews from critics, and it surely will have its work cut out for it. Could this be \"All the King’s Men\" all over again?\"A Good Year\" stands as that rare film which reunites an Oscar-caliber director with an Oscar-winning actor that earns bad reviews and lukewarm studio support. Crowe’s last film \"Cinderella Man\" bowed to $18.3M from 2,812 theaters for a $6,515 average in June of last year and was considered an underperformer. The actor’s latest picture lacks the Ron Howard film’s strong critical support, added starpower from Renee Zellweger, and sizable push from Universal. \"A Good Year\" should play mostly to adult female audiences as the male appeal is low. That makes \"Babel\" and \"Stranger Than Fiction,\" which have better cross-gender appeal, direct competitors this weekend for mature couples. Opening in 2,066 theaters, \"A Good Year\" could find itself with about $8M this weekend and a rough road ahead.Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott enter chick flick territory with \"A Good Year.\"Still in the top ten with \"The Prestige,\" Christian Bale comes back for double duty in the new action thriller \"Harsh Times\" from MGM. The R-rated film from the writer of \"Training Day\" finds the Caped Crusader playing an ex-Army Ranger enlisting with the LAPD who still has ties into the crime world in South Central. \"Harsh\" will play to urban audiences and should skew male but will find the marketplace difficult to navigate with bigger titles like \"Borat\" and \"Saw III\" already doing strong business with that demo. Bale lacks the drawing power of Denzel Washington in his Oscar-winning role in \"Training Day\" so the grosses should not be in the same ballpark. A moderate national release in over 900 theaters will also limit the potential. \"Harsh Times\" will have to fight hard in order to crack the top ten and could finish the frame with around $3M.Christian Bale as a psychopath in \"Harsh Times.\"Among holdovers, all eyes will be on \"Borat\" this weekend. Can the Kazakh superstar spend another weekend at number one? Following its robust $26.5M bow from 837 theaters, the Sacha Baron Cohen starrer has delivered solid midweek results grossing over $3M on both Monday and Tuesday. Now, Fox will expand the raunchy comedy on Friday by more than tripling the run to 2,565 theaters allowing everyone to have easy access to the most-talked-about film of the season. Word-of-mouth has been encouraging and \"Borat\" might even reach the Holy Grail of the box office – repeat business.Last weekend’s potent average of $31,607 will certainly come crashing down since the film will be in more theaters and most of the hardcore fans have now already seen it. But the buzz is still hot and the Uzbekistan-hating TV journalist is now trying to crossover into new audience segments not initially sold on the concept last week. With the frame’s new films all a mixed bag without a surefire smash among them, \"Borat\" looks ready to retain its hold on the number one spot. A weekend gross of around $24M could result giving Fox a stellar $62M in only ten days.\"Kazakhstan is the greatest…\"Another cross-cultural film with a five-letter title starting with a B expanding over the weekend is \"Babel\" starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Paramount Vantage has attracted scorching results in limited release for two weeks and is now hoping that moviegoers nationwide are ready for the acclaimed drama. Last weekend, \"Babel\" popped into the Top 20 with a stellar $26,264 average from 35 locations. On Friday, the R-rated film expands to over 1,200 sites and should continue to play to an upscale adult audience.\"Babel\" is likely to play to the same crowd that powered last December’s \"Syriana\" to a $11.7M bow from 1,752 theaters for a $6,699 average. That film had more theaters and a star, George Clooney, who is despised by many American moviegoers for his political beliefs. On the other hand, Pitt can cheat on his wife and father a baby with another woman, and the public still can’t get enough of him. That’s pure starpower. But \"Babel\" is not the type of commercial role that Pitt attracts large crowds to. Still, the average should be solid so given its level of distribution, \"Babel\" could gross about $10M this weekend.Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, looking rather disheveled in \"Babel.\"Disney and Paramount went head to head last weekend with competing kidpics and split the family vote in half pretty evenly. \"Flushed Away\" is getting better word-of-mouth and is offering audiences something new so its decline might be smaller than that of \"The Santa Clause 3.\" Kid movies opening in early November typically have good legs and enjoy strong second weekend holds. Sophomore drops for recent films of the genre include 21% for last year’s \"Chicken Little,\" 29% for 2004’s \"The Incredibles,\" 15% for 2003’s \"Elf,\" and 15% for 2002’s \"The Santa Clause 2.\" This weekend, \"Clause 3\" might drop by 25% and \"Flushed\" could wash away 20% leaving each with a three-day tally in the neighborhood of $15M. That would push ten-day cumes to roughly $39M a piece for the Mouse House pic and the rat toon.LAST YEAR: Disney’s poultry toon \"Chicken Little\" stayed at number one for a second weekend with an impressive $31.7M. Three new releases followed within a tight range. Sony’s big-budget kidpic \"Zathura\" bowed in second with $13.4M on its way to a disappointing $28.2M. Jennifer Aniston was close behind with her thriller \"Derailed\" which opened to $12.2M. The Weinstein Co. release went on to gross a moderate $36M. Paramount’s urban action pic \"Get Rich or Die Tryin’\" debuted in fourth place with a $12M weekend and $17.7M over five days. The 50 Cent starrer finished its run with $31M. Rounding out the top five was the military drama \"Jarhead\" which tumbled 58% to $11.7M. Premiering to sensational results was the period film \"Pride &amp; Prejudice\" which grossed $2.9M from only 215 theaters for a sizzling $13,326 average. The Focus release went on to become an awards contender and took in $38.4M making it the top-grossing pic among the weekend’s new films.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"WarnerMedia, renewed, Rey, Disney, bond, Song, Writers, Video, drama, vampires, Century, Yoda, spain","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-New-Pics-Challenge-Borats-Mandate"},{"id":"47509158715505","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Santa Battles Borat for Weekend Crown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Santa Battles Borat for Weekend Crownby Gitesh Pandya | November 2, 2006 |  CommentsA pair of new family films aimed at kids will duke it out for the top spot this weekend while a bumbling reporter from the former Soviet Union will cause a commotion for a more adult crowd.Disney unleashes \"The Santa Clause 3,\" Paramount counters with its own kidpic \"Flushed Away,\" and Fox lets loose its outrageous comedy \"Borat.\" Together, the three new releases should provide some zing to the North American box office.Kris Kringle takes on Jack Frost in Disney’s latest family pic \"The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause\" which the studio hopes will win the weekend’s battle of the kidpics. With a tame G rating, the Tim Allen film finds the former \"Home Improvement\" star trying to get back to his winning ways at the box office with a new chapter of his most successful franchise. Martin Short joins the cast as Frost. Allen crapped out at the multiplexes this past summer when his kidpic \"Zoom\" crashed and burned with only $4.5M on opening weekend. He needs to prove that he can still sell tickets.The studio has had great luck with its \"Santa Clause\" franchise and its launching pad of early November. The first film in 1994 bowed to $19.3M on its way to $144.8M while the 2002 sequel opened to $29M heading to a $139.2M final. The gimmick just isn’t as interesting anymore. However, this time of year is typically active for the family audience and there could be room for both new pics to find their audiences. Still many of the same people will be torn between the two and will not have time to see both. Disney and Paramount would have been wise to open their films at least a week apart instead of on top of each other. Opening in more than 3,000 theaters, \"The Santa Clause 3\" could debut with about $22M.Tim Allen is back for a third \"Santa Clause.\"Parents looking for another kind of battle this weekend can pick the claymation film \"Flushed Away\" which presents a pampered pet mouse against a slimey sewer rat having fun in each other’s world. The PG-rated film is produced by DreamWorks and released by its new parent Paramount. Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, and Kate Winslet provide their voices. \"Flushed Away’s\" biggest challenge, of course, will be from stiff competition from the opening of an established franchise film like \"Clause 3.\" Reviews have been quite good so the studio is hoping that many adults will find \"Flushed\" to be the more original and entertaining choice and choose it instead. DreamWorks scored a $16M bow last fall for the critical darling \"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\" and could approach the same territory here. The marketing push for the new film has been stronger, but the competition will cancel out that added benefit. Opening in roughly 3,250 locations, \"Flushed Away\" might debut to about $16M.Hugh Jackman provides the voice of Roddy in \"Flushed Away.\"Sacha Baron Cohen hits theaters on Friday in one of the season’s most-talked-about films, \"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.\" Box office expectations are all over the map for Fox’s R-rated comedy and it’s anyone’s guess how it will play out as there is no real film in history it can be compared to. The studio has executed a brilliant marketing campaign over the past several months with teaser posters of the fake journalist sparking curiousity with those not familiar with the character from Britain’s \"Da Ali G Show\" which has also found a home in the U.S on HBO. The Toronto International Film Festival screening brought the buzz to a whole new level with its outrageous red carpet premiere, projector snafus, and overwhelmingly warm response. Publicity stunts this fall with Kazakh government officials also helped \"Borat\" leap from the entertainment page to the front page reaching an audience that would otherwise be tough to reach. Reviews have been glowing with many critics calling it the funniest film in years.The studio is releasing \"Borat\" in moderate national release with 837 theaters hoping to keep the product limited in the beginning. Sell outs combined with the expected positive word-of-mouth should fuel even more excitement justifying an expansion next week. The \"Ali G\" crowd will be out in full force so strong business should result from young men. That means that the second weekend of \"Saw III\" will provide some tough competition. Reports indicate that awareness is not too high in the middle of the country, but that should not be the case with the college crowd. Young adults want bold envelope-pushing films to see like the \"Jackass\" pics and \"Borat\" will play to much of that crowd. But is this only a blue-state film? Some thought that would be the case for 2004’s \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" before it opened to a surprising first place finish with $23.9M from only 868 theaters.A scene of cultural learnings in \"Borat.\"\"Borat’s\" humor has the potential to go beyond the immature set and play to CNN-watching adults. Many will be offended and will never be converted. But a very strong average is assured this weekend and long-term success is likely too since there will be no other movie out there that comes close to resembling this picture. For the opening weekend, \"Borat\" might gross around $11M for an average north of $10,000.\"Saw III\" should be the only holdover likely to still put a dent into the box office. Second weekend declines for the previous installments in the franchise were 39% for the first pic and 47% for last year’s \"Saw II.\" Even with no competition for the horror crowd, a hefty drop should occur. Look for the third torture flick to get sliced in half which would give it around $17M for the frame and $61M in ten days.LAST YEAR: Disney led the frame with its non-Pixar digital toon \"Chicken Little\" which debuted to a cool $40M. The animated film went on to gross $135.4M. Opening with strength in the runnerup spot was Universal’s war drama \"Jarhead\" with $27.7M on its way to $62.7M. \"Saw II\" dropped to third with $16.9M in its second weekend. Fourth place went to \"The Legend of Zorro\" with $10M while Meryl Streep‘s \"Prime\" rounded out the top five with $5.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"football, Spectrum, ABC, Yoda","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Santa-Battles-Borat-for-Weekend-Crown"},{"id":"47509157174360","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Messengers\" Scores Slim Win Over Super Bowl Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Messengers\" Scores Slim Win Over Super Bowl Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | February 5, 2007 |  CommentsWith the Super Bowl taking males out of the picture, mothers and daughters squared off at the North American box office this weekend with the younger set earning a slim victory. The spooky thriller \"The Messengers\" opened at number one driven by teenage girls and young women while the Diane Keaton comedy \"Because I Said So\" bowed close behind in the runnerup position drawing upon older women.The overall box office picture was bleak as the top ten slumped below the $70M mark for the second time in three weekends.Sony scored its seventh consecutive victory over Super Bowl weekend with the haunted house spookfest \"The Messengers,\" which grossed an estimated $14.5M in its debut frame. The PG-13 pic averaged a solid $5,736 from 2,528 locations but was weaker than the studio’s previous three hits that ruled this particular weekend. Last year, the horror pic \"When a Stranger Calls\" topped the charts with a $21.6M opening and $7,205 average, in 2005 \"Boogeyman\" led with a $19M bow and $6,232 average, and in 2004 \"You Got Served\" hit number one with $16.1M and a $8,341 average. \"Messengers\" did however post the best opening for a horror film since October’s \"Saw III.\" A long string of terror flops were tossed into the marketplace in between with disappointing results.Budgeted at only $16M, \"The Messengers\" skewed to a young female audience. According to studio research, 53% of the crowd was female and an equal percentage was under the age of 21. The studio is already planning for next year’s Super Bowl frame when it will release the horror remake \"Prom Night,\" which will again cater to the same crowd. Teenage girls and young women historically have been the group least interested in football’s big championship game making them an attractive audience to target on this weekend. Creepy PG-13 films with strong female characters coupled with saavy marketing have led to many number one hits for Sony and its Screen Gems unit. But with the grosses getting smaller, movie fans could be telling Hollywood that it is dipping into this well too often.Opening in second place with respectable results was \"Because I Said So\" with an estimated $13M from 2,526 theaters. Averaging $5,155 per location, the PG-13 film stars Diane Keaton as a meddlesome mother trying to find love for her unmarried daughter played by Mandy Moore. Men showed practically zero interest in the Universal release. Studio research showed that a whopping 82% of the audience was female. The film also played more to Keaton fans than to the Moore crowd as 55% of the turnout was 35 or older. 83% was Caucasian. Critics trashed \"Because\" and \"Messengers\" may have eaten into its potential with younger women.Last weekend’s number one film \"Epic Movie\" dropped a sizable 56% in its second weekend and ranked third with an estimated $8.2M. With $29.4M in ten days, the spoof comedy looks on course to finish with $40-44M making it a bit smaller than Fox’s spoof from last February \"Date Movie.\" That spin on romantic comedies grossed a somewhat stronger $33.8M in its first ten days, had a slightly lower 53% sophomore drop, and found its way to $48.5M.Fox’s runaway smash \"Night at the Museum\" slipped only 29% and placed fourth with an estimated $6.8M pushing its tally to $225.4M. The durable Ben Stiller blockbuster became the first film to spend seven weekends in the top five since 2004’s \"The Passion of the Christ.\"Universal’s mob thriller \"Smokin’ Aces\" dropped 57% to an estimated $6.3M in its second weekend and put its cume at $25M after ten days. The step dancing hit \"Stomp the Yard\" followed with an estimated $4.2M, off 45%, for a total of $56M. The Oscar-nominated musical \"Dreamgirls\" saw the worst decline of its run dropping 40% to an estimated $4M. Cume stands at $92.8M.Picturehouse added 259 theaters to the run of the fantasy pic \"Pan’s Labyrinth\" and stayed put at number eight with an estimated $3.7M. With six Academy Award nominations, the R-rated film upped its cume to $21.7M while its average of $3,383 was the third best in the top ten. Will Smith‘s tenth career $100M blockbuster \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" took in an estimated $3.1M, down 38%, for a $157.4M total to date.Tied for tenth place with an estimated $2.7M in ticket sales each were the Helen Mirren Oscar nominated pic \"The Queen\" and the Jennifer Garner dramedy \"Catch and Release.\" The Miramax contender for Best Picture slipped 33% raising its cume to $45.5M while the Sony flick tumbled 65% in its second weekend thanks to its female audience shifting over to the frame’s two new releases. The ten-day total stands at a weak $12M.The horror remake \"The Hitcher\" also saw sales nosedive and dropped out of the top ten. The Focus release slumped 68% to an estimated $1.2M giving the R-rated scarefest only $15.6M overall. A final gross of $17M seems likely.MGM and The Weinstein Co. saw a solid start for its indie drama \"Factory Girl,\" starring media darling Sienna Miller grossing an estimated $95,000 from only three theaters for a stellar $31,764 average per site. Bowing in just New York and Los Angeles, the R-rated film tells of the rise of Edie Sedgwick and her mentor Andy Warhol. Reviews were mostly negative.The top ten films grossed an estimated $66.5M which was off 13% from last year when \"When A Stranger Calls\" opened at number one with $21.6M; and down 19% from 2005 when \"Boogeyman\" debuted on top with $19M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"One, ITV, Pictures, Nickelodeon, high, E3, Hulu, spain, MTV, Moore, comedies, Amazon, Western, review, Winter","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Messengers-Scores-Slim-Win-Over-Super-Bowl-Weekend"},{"id":"47509158710382","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Sexytime for \"Borat\" Once Again!","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Sexytime for \"Borat\" Once Again!by Gitesh Pandya | November 12, 2006 |  CommentsThere was no stopping the Kazakh sensation Borat which expanded nationally this weekend after a stunning debut and remained at the top of the North American box office once again.In fact, the top three spots remained unchanged as ticket buyers ignored most of the new offerings aimed at them this weekend. Will Ferrell‘s new comedy Stranger Than Fiction posted a respectable opening, but Hollywood stars Russell Crowe and Sarah Michelle Gellar suffered some of the worst openings of their careers this weekend as their new films, A Good Year and The Return respectively, were both dead on arrival. The overall marketplace struggled to keep pace with previous years as for the first time since 1997, the first half of November failed to deliver a single film with a weekend gross of at least $30M.Borat crushed its competitors for a second straight weekend as the raunchy docu-comedy expanded from 837 to 2,566 theaters and grossed a stellar $29M, according to studio estimates. By more than tripling its theater count, Fox put its hit into full nationwide release and actually saw its three-day take climb 10% over the debut frame. Borat’s per-theater average understandably dropped by two-thirds this weekend to a still strong $11,302. The ten-day cume stands at an amazing $67.8M and at its current pace, the $18M movie-film could find its way to the $140M mark from the domestic market alone.Thanks to a wave of media hype this fall, the Sacha Baron Cohen creation has become a national phenomenon and is already make benefit from glorious word-of-mouth and repeat business, according to the studio. Holdover theaters witnessed drops of about 30% from last weekend which is encouraging as it moves forward to fight off James Bond and other holiday pics armed with a war chest full of marketing dollars. Borat has become the first film to spend back-to-back weekends at number one since the football drama Invincible which opened in August, and has generated the best ten-day start of any movie since the Will Ferrell blockbuster Talladega Nights which also co-starred Cohen. Both comedies saw their main stars appearing on talk shows in-character to generate publicity.Holding steady in the runnerup spot was Disney’s Christmas flick The Santa Clause 3 which dipped only 13% to an estimated $16.9M. After ten days, the Tim Allen sequel has grossed $41.1M putting it behind the pace of the last installment in the franchise. In 2002, The Santa Clause 2 also bowed on the first weekend of November and dropped 15% to $24.7M in its sophomore session. Its ten-day cume of $60M repped 43% of its eventual $139.2M gross. Clause 3 looks to be on course to erode at a similar pace which would allow it to reach the vicinity of $90M.Also staying put for a second weekend was the animated comedy Flushed Away which remained in third place with an estimated $16.7M. Off only 11%, the Paramount release has upped its cume to $39.9M and remains just a step behind Santa. With better buzz and a slightly slimmer decline, Flushed could also reach the same region and conclude its run near the $90M level.Santa and Flushed opened last weekend and split the family audience almost evenly with only a $700,000 difference in their weekend debuts. This frame, the gap was cut down to only $200,000. Per-theater averages were also close with Santa averaging $4,885 from 3,458 and Flushed averaging $4,508 from 3,707 sites. But both films will face stiff competition on Friday when Warner Bros. goes after the exact same crowd with its heavily-hyped penguin toon Happy Feet which has been backed by a sizable marketing push.Will Ferrell‘s newest comedy Stranger Than Fiction led the frame’s new releases and bowed in fourth place with an estimated $14.1M from 2,264 theaters. Averaging a solid $6,228, the PG-13 film about a man who discovers his life is being narrated by an author earned good reviews and co-starred Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal. The production budget for the Sony release was under $30M. According to studio data, Fiction’s audience was 55% female while 53% were under 30. As a smart comedy aimed at young adults, the film did not open like Ferrell’s bigger smashes like Talladega Nights ($47M), but it does hope to have good legs.The horror sequel Saw III fell hard once again dropping 55% in its third weekend to an estimated $6.6M pushing the 17-day cume to $69.9M. The third installment in the popular torture franchise is running a bit behind the pace of last year’s Saw II which enjoyed a third-weekend take of $9.1M for a total of $73.9M over the same number of days.After two successful weeks in limited release, Paramount Vantage’s cross-continent drama Babel expanded nationally to mixed results with an estimated $5.7M. The Brad Pitt–Cate Blanchett pic averaged a decent $4,517 from 1,251 locations and raised its sum to $7.5M. Last weekend, Babel grossed just under $1M from 35 theaters for a potent $26,264 average, but arthouse films don’t always remain powerful after expanding into all regions of North America.Martin Scorsese‘s The Departed took in an estimated $5.2M in its sixth mission, down 32%, giving Warner Bros. $109.8M to date. With $58M overseas, the Leonardo DiCaprio–Matt Damon cop drama sits at more than $168M worldwide and counting. Opening close behind in eighth place was the horror pic The Return with an estimated $4.8M from 1,986 theaters for a weak $2,405 average. For Sarah Michelle Gellar, the PG-13 film’s debut represented her second worst opening ever in a lead role after 1999’s Simply Irresistible with $2.2M. Focus Features was the distributor.The magician pic The Prestige followed with an estimated $4.6M, off 38%, for a $46M cume to date for Buena Vista. Like Gellar, Russell Crowe also bombed with his new entry. The romantic comedy A Good Year bowed to just $3.8M, according to estimates, averaging a poor $1,827 per theater from 2,066 sites. Fox’s PG-13 pic barely entered the top ten as Crowe suffered his worst opening since Mystery, Alaska‘s $3.1M launch in 1999. Like so many other fall films targeting mature adults, Year just did not have room to breathe and flopped instantly. Poor reviews also hurt the Ridley Scott-directed picture which played mostly to older women.Another new release that failed to excite paying customers was MGM’s action thriller Harsh Times which debuted outside of the top ten with an estimated $1.8M from 956 locations. Averaging a sluggish $1,913 per site, the R-rated pic finds Christian Bale playing a bad cop on the streets of South Central.Four films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Clint Eastwood‘s war saga Flags of Our Fathers grossed an estimated $2.8M falling 36% in its fourth attack. The $90M Paramount release has amassed only $31M to date and looks headed for an underwhelming $38-40M finish. Miramax’s awards contender The Queen continued to expand, but faced the first weekend decline of its seven-week run. The Helen Mirren film collected an estimated $2.6M from 484 venues for a decent $5,372 average. The Queen was playing in 387 theaters last week and bumped its cume to $13.8M while its average declined by 29%.Sony’s hit toon Open Season tumbled 53% to an estimated $1.4M. With $83.5M in the bank, the $85M film should end its season with around $86M. Just a week away from giving audiences a dual voice role in the Warner Bros. toon Happy Feet, funnyman Robin Williams saw his political comedy Man of the Year pass the $36M mark. A final tally of just under $40M seems likely for the not-so-stellar Universal title.The top ten films grossed an estimated $107.4M which was dead even with last year when Chicken Little remained at number one with $31.7M; and down 18% from 2004 when The Incredibles stayed in the top spot with $50.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"show, Tomatazos, Amazon, Amazon, york, venice, Kimmy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Sexytime-for-Borat-Once-Again"},{"id":"47509160169600","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Covenant\" Leads Pathetic B.O.

Frameby Gitesh Pandya | September 10, 2006 |  CommentsTumbleweeds blew through North American theaters this weekend as movie fans forgot that there were films playing at their local cinemas. For the first time in three years, no film managed to generate at least $10M in weekend ticket sales. The new supernatural teen thriller \"The Covenant\" was able to top the charts while the murder mystery \"Hollywoodland\" debuted in the runnerup spot. The overall top ten crawled to its worst performance in three years as not a single wide release was able to generate at least $4,000 per theater.\"The Covenant\" didn’t break $10M but still managed to lead the B.O.Limping into first place with a not-so-impressive debut was \"The Covenant\" with an estimated $9M from 2,681 theaters. The Sony thriller averaged a sluggish $3,357 per playdate, but was big enough to lead the pack over such a weak frame. Budgeted at only $20M, the PG-13 pic features a group of young prep school warlocks who unleash supernatural powers when evil strikes. It was the studio’s ninth number one opening of 2006, but also the worst gross for a number one film since \"Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star\" debuted this very weekend in 2003 with a puny $6.7M.Most of the box office deficit when compared to last year can be blamed on the mediocre debut of \"Covenant\" which took in less than one-third of the $30.1M bow the studio saw in 2005 this weekend with its last post-Labor Day scarefest \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\" The rest of the top ten this weekend grossed a combined $40.4M which was almost identical to the $40.6M from the corresponding films from last year.Adrien Brody shows who’s boss in \"Hollywoodland.\"Opening in second place was the crime thriller \"Hollywoodland\" with an estimated $6M from only 1,548 theaters for Focus. The R-rated tale examining the investigation behind the death of Superman actor George Reeves averaged a mild $3,881 per site. That was good enough to be the best average among all wide releases. Starring Adrien Brody, Diane Lane, and Ben Affleck, \"Hollywoodland\" received mixed reviews from critics, but did manage to win the best actor prize over the weekend at the Venice International Film Festival for Affleck’s portrayal of Reeves.Dropping from first to third place, Mark Wahlberg‘s two-time box office champ \"Invincible\" took in an estimated $5.8M falling a steep 52%. After 17 days, the Disney sports drama has scored $45.7M.Bowing in fourth place was Thai action star Tony Jaa‘s \"The Protector\" with an estimated $5M from 1,541 sites. Averaging a lukewarm $3,265, the R-rated pic from The Weinstein Co. generated an opening weekend average similar to the $3,449 figure that Jaa’s \"Ong Bak\" posted last year when it opened to $1.3M from only 387 theaters.Statham knows people in high places.Action star Jason Statham‘s \"Crank\" dropped a hefty 54% in its second weekend to an estimated $4.8M pushing its cume to $19.9M. After ten days, the Lionsgate release is running slightly ahead of the $17.2M that Statham’s 2002 film \"The Transporter\" made during the same time period, but behind the $30.3M of its sequel from last year. Look for \"Crank\" to finish up with $27-30M. Enjoying the smallest decline in the top ten was the Edward Norton-Paul Giamatti mystery \"The Illusionist\" which dipped just 25% to an estimated $4.6M. Yari Film Group has collected $18.1M thus far.Following close behind with an estimated $4.4M was Fox Searchlight’s \"Little Miss Sunshine\" which dropped 42%. Total to date is a solid $41.6M. Nicolas Cage‘s suspense thriller \"The Wicker Man\" fell 57% in its second weekend to an estimated $4.1M. With only $17.5M in ten days, the Warner Bros. release looks on course to reach a disappointing $25M.\"Talladega Nights\" has a lot to cheer for.\"Talladega Nights,\" the highest-grossing film since Johnny Depp’s \"Pirates\" sequel set sail, dropped 51% in its sixth lap to an estimated $3M boosting Sony’s total to $142.2M. Rounding out the top ten was Paramount’s hit toon \"Barnyard,\" the only major kidpic in release, which grossed an estimated $2.6M. Off 47%, the PG-rated comedy has grossed a healthy $66.9M to date.Three August releases dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Paramount’s \"World Trade Center\" took in an estimated $2.5M, down 46%, for a $67.1M sum. The $65M Nicolas Cage drama should end with a solid $71-74M final. Universal’s teen comedy \"Accepted\" collected an estimated $2.5M as well, off 45%, and upped its total to $32.3M. A $35-37M final grade is in store for the $23M production.Buena Vista’s surprise hit dance drama \"Step Up\" dropped 45% in its fifth weekend to an estimated $2.5M. With $61.6M in the bank, the teen pic looks to finish with around $65M.The top ten films grossed a puny estimate of $49.4M which was down 30% from last year when \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" debuted at number one with $30.1M; and down 16% from 2004 when \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\" opened in the top spot with $23M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"bad, Awards, The, It, Warner, movie, Action, Walt, Musical, King, spain, The, science, foreign, Month","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Covenant-Leads-Pathetic-BO-Frame"},{"id":"47509158707308","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Penguins Edge Out Bond For #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Penguins Edge Out Bond For #1 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | November 19, 2006 |  CommentsIn what was a very close race for box office supremacy, the dancing penguin cartoon Happy Feet narrowly edged out a strong debut for the new James Bond actioner Casino Royale for the number one spot in North America this weekend.Final numbers will be released on Monday after all Sunday ticket sales are counted up, but the animated adventure is still expected to lead by a slim margin. If estimates hold, the frame will mark only the second time in box office history that two films have opened with over $40M each on the same weekend. The potent pair also helped to push the top ten to its highest level in four months.The mighty penguins of Happy Feet flexed their muscles and took over the number one spot this weekend opening to an estimated $42.3M. Warner Bros. launched the computer-animated film in an ultrawide 3,804 locations and averaged a stellar $11,125 per theater. The PG-rated pic finds a young penguin named Mumble trying to find his place in the world and features the voices of Robin Williams, Elijah Wood, Nicole Kidman, and Hugh Jackman. The studio is estimating a optimistically slim Saturday-to-Sunday decline of only 14%.Happy Feet was backed by a massive marketing campaign and beat out the openings of other recent computer-animated kids movies like DreamWorks’ Over the Hedge ($38.5M), Disney’s Chicken Little ($40M), and Fox’s Robots ($36M). However, it did not reach the Pixar territory of Cars ($60.1M) and The Incredibles ($70.5M). But with competing kids movies The Santa Clause 3 and Flushed Away still in the top five, Happy Feet performed as well as expected given the choices that the target audience has. With the Thanksgiving school holidays approaching, the $100M penguin pic should enjoy a robust sophomore frame.After a four-year hiatus, Sony and MGM restarted the James Bond franchise with Casino Royale and generated an impressive $40.6M over the weekend, according to estimates, settling in for a close second place finish. The Daniel Craig starrer generated the best per-theater average among all wide releases with a potent $11,823 from 3,434 sites. It was the second biggest opening ever for the franchise trailing the $47.1M bow of the last installment, 2002’s Die Another Day. Casino was never expected to reach the heights of Die since it had a new and mostly unknown star in the lead and no famous co-star like Halle Berry to add more ammunition. Casino did attract rave reviews from critics which helped to sell the idea of a non-Pierce Brosnan Bond film to an American audience that was unfamiliar with Craig.Brosnan’s first Bond film Goldeneye, which opened on the same weekend in 1995 and was also directed by Martin Campbell, bowed to $26.2M from 2,667 theaters for a $9,826 average. At today’s ticket prices, that would translate to an opening weekend average of roughly $13,000. Brosnan’s future Agent 007 flicks would each post larger openings so Craig, who is contracted for at least two more films, could follow suit and see even bigger grosses in the years ahead as audiences become more comfortable with him. The next adventure is already slated for a November 7, 2008 launch.Sony’s research showed that Casino Royale’s audience was 55% male and 57% 25 and older. Around the world, Bond dominated the box office with even greater results opening at number one in 27 markets with an estimated $42.2M overseas. The U.K. led the field with a spectacular $25.6M bow.Following its two-week reign over the U. S. and A., Borat dropped to third place collecting an estimated $14.4M in its third weekend of release. Down 49% from last weekend, the Fox comedy has lifted its cume to a stellar $90.5M in 17 days and could cross the century mark by Thanksgiving Day. Budgeted at only $18M (plus the cost of litigating its many current lawsuits), Borat looks to finish in the neighborhood of $125M domestically.The two new films topping the charts helped to give most holdover films some hefty declines. Disney’s The Santa Clause 3 dropped 52% to an estimated $8.2M in its third weekend for a cume to date of $51.6M. After two weeks in third place, the animated pic Flushed Away got hit hard by the dancing penguins and dropped to fifth with an estimated $6.8M. Down a steep 59%, the Paramount/DreamWorks venture raised its sum to $48.8M.The Will Ferrell comedy Stranger Than Fiction had a tough sophomore frame grossing an estimated $6.6M, off 51%, to give Sony a ten-day total of $22.9M. Budgeted at under $30M, the Marc Forster-directed pic should find its way to $35-40M. The cross-continent drama Babel fell 48% in its second weekend of wide release and captured an estimated $2.9M putting the total at $12M for Paramount Vantage. After scorching results in limited release, the Brad Pitt–Cate Blanchett film is having a hard time competing on a nationwide scale.The horror sequel Saw III followed with an estimated $2.8M, tumbling 60%, putting Lionsgate’s cume at $74.9M. Warner Bros. grossed an estimated $2.6M for The Departed which declined by 50% in its seventh mission giving Martin Scorsese‘s top-grossing film $113.9M to date.Creeping into tenth place was the experimental film festival called After Dark’s Horror Fest – 8 Films to Die For with an estimated weekend gross of $2.5M. The distributor offered eight different low-budget fright flicks throughout the weekend in 488 locations averaging a solid $5,086. With so many titles, many fans were encouraged to buy more than one ticket throughout the frame. Freestyle Releasing handled distribution.Debuting poorly outside of the top ten was the jailhouse comedy Let’s Go To Prison which locked up an estimated $2.1M in ticket sales from 1,495 locations for a dismal $1,410 average. According to its distributor Universal, the R-rated revenge comedy played mostly to young men with studio research showing that 67% of the audience was under the age of 25 and 59% was male.Three high profile films premiered in limited release with varying results. MGM platformed The Weinstein Co. political drama Bobby in only two theaters and grossed an estimated $67,000 for a potent $33,500 average. Written and directed by Emilio Estevez, the star-studded film about the day Robert Kennedy was assassinated boasts a cast featuring Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Fishburne, Elijah Wood, Lindsay Lohan, Sharon Stone, Helen Hunt, Demi Moore, William H. Macy, Heather Graham, Ashton Kutcher, and Martin Sheen. The R-rated film expands nationwide on Thursday, Thanksgiving Day.Also opening to strong results was Warner Independent’s film industry comedy For Your Consideration which debuted in 23 theaters with an estimated $394,000 for a solid $17,130 average. The Christopher Guest-directed film launched in a dozen cities and will widen to over 600 runs nationwide on Wednesday. The filmmaker’s last picture A Mighty Wind had wider distribution and opened to $2.1M from 133 theaters for a $15,881 average in April of 2003 on its way to a $17.8M overall take.Arthouse moviegoers did not have an appetite for Fox Searchlight’s junk food industry pic Fast Food Nation which debuted in 321 theaters with an estimated $390,000 for a poor $1,215 average. Starring Greg Kinnear, Wilmer Valderrama, Ethan Hawke, and Patricia Arquette, the R-rated film attracted mixed reviews from critics.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. The magician pic The Prestige took in an estimated $2M in its fifth frame, down 58%, boosting the cume to $49.4M. Look for a final tally of around $54M for the Buena Vista hit.A pair of star-driven flops that opened last week crumbled in their sophomore frames losing more than half of their audience. Sarah Michelle Gellar’s suspense thriller The Return grossed an estimated $1.7M, down 62%, for a measly total of $6.9M after ten days. Russell Crowe‘s stab at a romantic comedy, Fox’s A Good Year, fell 56% to an estimated $1.6M putting its total at $6.4M. An embarrassing final total of about $9M should result for each pic.The top ten films grossed an estimated $129.7M which was down a hefty 23% from last year when Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire opened at number one with a jaw-dropping $102.3M; and down 7% from 2004 when National Treasure debuted in the top spot with $35.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"school, thirty, versus, football, films, shows","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Penguins-Edge-Out-Bond-For-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509160151158","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Grudge Sequel Attacks #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Grudge Sequel Attacks #1 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | October 15, 2006 |  CommentsMoviegoers were in the mood to be spooked this weekend as the horror sequel The Grudge 2 scared its way to a number one opening after its release on Friday the 13th.Last week’s chart-topper, the mob thriller The Departed, remained strong in its second weekend taking the runnerup spot while the new Robin Williams political comedy Man of the Year finished third in the polls with a respectable voter turnout. The weekend’s other new releases, the action film The Marine and the historical epic One Night with the King, generated low-to-moderate ticket sales. Overall, the North American box office remained vibrant with one of the best October showings in recent years.\"The Grudge 2\"With Halloween around the corner, teens and young adults were craving a good scare and powered the horror flick The Grudge 2 to the top of the charts with an estimated $22M in its opening weekend. Averaging a creepy $6,851 from 3,211 locations, the PG-13 film gave Sony its 12th number one opener of 2006 even though it debuted far below the $39.1M launch of its predecessor two years ago. Sarah Michelle Gellar, who anchored the first Grudge, only appears briefly in the sequel which instead stars the lesser-known television actress Amber Tamblyn as the sister who comes across a supernatural curse. Takashi Shimizu, the director behind the first Grudge as well as the Japanese Ju-On pics which inspired it, once again helms.After the 2004 surprise smash went on to gross $110.2M from a measly $10M production budget, a sequel was developed. Once again, young women led the way in buying tickets. Studio research showed that 52% of the audience was female and 54% was under the age of 21. The PG-13 rating of the $20M sequel was key to bringing in the high school set, but arriving in the marketplace just seven days after the R-rated horror pic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning made it a bit difficult to get the college crowd. Fall’s fright film festival continues on its merry way with the October 27 launch of Saw III and the November 10 arrival of Gellar in a full starring role in the supernatural thriller The Return.Enjoying a powerful second weekend was Martin Scorsese‘s crime thriller The Departed which slipped from first place grossing an estimated $18.7M. Dropping only 31%, the Warner Bros. hit posted a terrific hold thanks to strong word-of-mouth and lifted its cume to an impressive $56.6M after ten days. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson, The Departed looks to be on course to become the director’s top-grossing film ever as it should beat the $102.6M of 2004’s The Aviator. The vicinity of $110M could be reached domestically for the $90M production with much more on tap overseas. Asian cinema inspired both of the top films in North America as Departed is a Hollywood remake of the Hong Kong blockbuster Infernal Affairs.\"The Departed\"Robin Williams returned to making mainstream comedies for adults with his political satire Man of the Year which debuted in third place with an estimated $12.6M. Playing in 2,515 sites, the Universal film about a popular talk show host who runs for president averaged an encouraging $4,990. For the Oscar winning funnyman, it was his second best opening this decade for a non-family film after the $20.9M bow of 2002’s cop thriller Insomnia. Williams scored recent hits with last spring’s RV which grossed $71.4M and last year’s animated film Robots which took in $128.2M. Man of the Year did not fare well with critics and The Departed continued to pull away adult audiences. But the Barry Levinson-directed comedy performed well as the only funny option for grown ups in the current marketplace.\"Man of the Year\"In its third weekend, Sony’s hit toon Open Season eased only 30% and grossed an estimated $11M pushing the 17-day total to a solid $59.2M. The horror prequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning tumbled an understandable 58% to an estimated $7.8M in its second weekend. New Line’s $16M fright flick has grossed $30.5M in ten days and should finish with $40-45M. Its predecessor, 2003’s remake of Chainsaw, held up better dropping 49% in its sophomore frame on its way to a $80.1M final.Wrestling superstar John Cena made a quiet debut on the big screen as his action film The Marine opened in sixth place with only $7M, according to estimates. Averaging a mild $2,750 from 2,545 theaters, the PG-13 pic appealed mostly to the entertainer’s core audience of young males. The Fox title about a discharged jarhead who sets out to save his kidnapped wife suffered horrendous reviews.\"The Marine\"The Ashton Kutcher–Kevin Costner Coast Guard adventure The Guardian continued to play well slipping 39% to an estimated $5.9M. Cume stands at $41.1M. Lionsgate’s Jessica Simpson comedy Employee of the Month fell 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $5.6M. With $19.9M in ten days, the PG-13 pic could reach $28-30M.Connecting with Christian audiences in moderate national release was the historical epic adventure One Night with the King which bowed to an estimated $4.3M from 909 theaters. The 8X release averaged a good $4,759 per site. The PG-rated film about the rise of the Queen of Persia stars Tiffany Dupont, Omar Sharif, and Peter O’Toole and was given a church-based marketing campaign. King ranked ninth but had the fourth best per-theater average in the top ten.Rounding out the top ten was a film not targeting churchgoers. Former number one Jackass: Number Two grossed an estimated $3.3M in its fourth outing falling 49%. Paramount has captured $68.4M thus far.\"Jackass: Number Two\"Opening to weak results in limited release was the indie drama Infamous which grossed an estimated $435,000 from 179 theaters for a disappointing $2,430 average. The Warner Independent release about writer Truman Capote failed to generate interest with arthouse moviegoers who recently spent $28.8M on Capote which went on win an Oscar for Best Actor for Philip Seymour Hoffman earlier this year. Toby Jones, Sandra Bullock, Daniel Craig, and Gwyneth Paltrow star in Infamous which will not be given a wider release.Still generating muscular numbers in limited release was Miramax’s acclaimed drama The Queen which expanded from 11 to 46 locations and grossed an estimated $1M. Jumping into the Top 20, the Helen Mirren film averaged a sensational $22,174 and boosted its sum to $1.9M with more markets set to open in the weeks ahead.Another world leader pic, The Last King of Scotland, also expanded into more cities this weekend while in its third conquest. The Fox Searchlight film grossed an estimated $605,000 from 104 locations for a solid $5,817 average. Total is $1.3M.\"The Last King of Scotland\"Four films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Leggy hit The Illusionist witnessed another of its under-30% drops in its ninth weekend of release. The Edward Norton drama slipped only 24% to an estimated $1.4M giving Yari Film Group a respectable $36.3M to date. A final tally of $40-42M could result. MGM’s comedy School for Scoundrels crumbled 63% to an estimated $1.3M giving the Billy Bob Thornton pic $16.3M. A $18M final gross is likely.Also falling hard were the male-skewing action films Fearless and Gridiron Gang with weekend estimates of $969,000 and $800,000, respectively. Jet Li‘s martial arts epic dropped 58% and has grossed $23.5M for Focus – a solid figure for a subtitled film. $25M may be reached. The Rock‘s football flick stumbled 64% and raised its cume to $38M. Sony’s final take should fall into the $39-40M range.The top ten films grossed an estimated $98.1M which was up a stellar 48% from last year when The Fog debuted at number one with $11M; and up 14% from 2004 when Shark Tale stayed in the top spot for a third consecutive weekend with $22M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Family, TBS","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Grudge-Sequel-Attacks-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509161681025","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Covenant Brings Evil to Theaters","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Covenant Brings Evil to Theatersby Gitesh Pandya | September 7, 2006 |  CommentsAfter welcoming in four new wide releases per week for seven straight weekends, the North American box office slows it down a bit on Friday with only one saturation release and a pair of moderate national bows.Sony courts the teen horror crowd with its supernatural thriller \"The Covenant.\" Meanwhile, Focus targets mature adults with the crime thriller \"Hollywoodland\" and The Weinstein Co. goes after the action audience with the martial arts pic \"The Protector.\" With a slate of Labor Day weekend pics coming off of their lukewarm holiday performances, the overall marketplace is sure to be sluggish and could slump to its lowest point of the year.Four prep school dudes learn of their ancestral powers and stir up some evil in the new teen chiller \"The Covenant.\" Sort of a \"Lost Boys\" for today’s youth, the PG-13 film will target the horror audience as well as the back-to-school date crowd. Renny Harlin, who has seen highs with \"Die Hard 2\" and lows with \"Cutthroat Island,\" directs. \"Covenant\" should play primarily to teens and young adults and Sony has a strong track record when it comes to attracting that crowd with these kinds of films. Last fall, the studio scored a big hit with \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" which bowed this very weekend with $30.1M, but saw more modest results with \"The Fog\" which opened in October with $11.8M. Each one still hit the top of the charts. The marketing push on \"Covenant\" has not been too fierce so a debut closer to \"Fog’s\" is likely. Competition for teens is not very strong at the moment so many should pick this for their weekend moviegoing choice. Attacking 2,681 theaters, \"The Covenant\" could scare up around $11M in ticket sales this weekend.More teen-horror hijinks in \"The Covenant\"Academy Award winner Adrien Brody plays a not-so-super sleuth in the 1950s who investigates the suicide death of Superman actor George Reeves in the new crime thriller \"Hollywoodland.\" The R-rated Focus release also stars Diane Lane, Ben Affleck, and Bob Hoskins. After last year’s dominance at the Oscars by numerous indie flicks, \"Hollywoodland\" tries to get the awards season started early by getting a headstart over some of the fall’s other promising non-studio films. The casting of the \"Gigli\" star as the Man of Steel, however, might diminish its chances a bit as many industry voters won’t be able to help but snicker when the daredevil himself comes on screen. Mature adults will be the target audience and women might outnumber the guys by a small margin. The film’s subject matter will certainly be intriguing for film industry folks, but it will be a tougher sell to mainstream moviegoers. \"Hollywoodland\" will have to reach its audience in a hurry as parent company Universal will target the exact same crowd with its ensemble-driven period crime mystery \"The Black Dahlia\" a week later. Debuting in moderate national release in 1,548 theaters, \"Hollywoodland\" might capture about $8M this weekend.Adrien Brody gets rough while investigating the death of tv’s SupermanThe \"Quentin Tarantino Presents\" marketing technique is back once again with the Thai martial arts pic \"The Protector\" starring Tony Jaa. The R-rated film from The Weinstein Co. finds the acrobatic action star seeking revenge on those who wronged his people. Jaa’s \"Ong Bak\" made a moderate splash at the North American box office last year when it opened to $1.3M from 387 theaters for a mild $3,449 average on its way to a $4.6M domestic take. A year and a half later, more American action fans know of Jaa, though he’s still far from a sizable draw. Two years ago, the Weinsteins saw stellar results when using the \"Pulp Fiction\" director’sname in the marketing of Jet Li‘s \"Hero\" which ended up topping the box office for two straight weeks on its way to a $53.6M gross. Lionsgate also used the QT tactic to drive in business for its horror pic \"Hostel\" last January which also bowed in the top spot. \"Protector\" will appeal mostly to young men who love martial arts and crossover to other groups is unlikely. The second weekend of \"Crank\" will draw upon many of the same folks so competition will be tough. Fighting its way into around 1,400 theaters, \"The Protector\" might kick up about $6M this weekend.Tony Jaa, doing his own stunts, in \"The Protector\"More independent films open in New York on Friday hoping to expand further around the country in coming weeks. Polychrome Pictures debuts the Asian American pic \"Red Doors\" in a pair of Manhattan locations. The dysfunctional family pic won the top prize at last year’s Tribeca Film Festival. Film Philos goes into one solo house with the coffee cart vendor drama \"Man Push Cart\" which world premiered at Sundance last winter.\"Invincible‘s\" undefeated season should come to an end this weekend as the Disney sports drama enters its third outing. A 40% decline would see the Mark Wahlberg pic gross around $7M pushing the 17-day cume to $47M. After a second place bow over the weekend, the Lionsgate actioner \"Crank\" pumped itself up to the top spot on Tuesday with solid midweek business. Jason Statham saw his \"Transporter 2\" fall 55% a year ago when it came off of its Labor Day debut. \"Crank\" could see a slightly smaller drop. A 50% tumble would give the poison pic roughly $5M for the sophomore frame and a ten-day sum of $20M.Nicolas Cage‘s \"The Wicker Man\" did not make too much of a dent at the box office last weekend. A 45% drop to around $5M seems likely giving Warner Bros. only $19M in ten days. Indie sensation \"Little Miss Sunshine\" should step back a bit after a strong Labor Day frame and could slide 30% to $5M as well. That would lift the cume for the year’s most recommended film to $42M making it the fifth biggest hit in company history for Fox Searchlight after \"Sideways\" ($71.5M), \"The Full Monty\" ($45.9M), \"28 Days Later\" ($45.1M), and \"Napoleon Dynamite\" ($44.5M). In another week, it will vault to number two for the Fox subsidiary.LAST YEAR: Sony scored a huge surprise winner with the suspense thriller \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" which bowed bigger than expected with a hefty $30.1M grossing more than the next five films combined. The fright flick went on to scare up a sturdy $75.1M. Comedy sensation \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" followed in second with $7.7M in its fourth date while \"Transporter 2\" fell from first to third with $7.4M. The political drama \"The Constant Gardener\" and the airline thriller \"Red Eye\" rounded out the top five with $4.7M and $4.5M, respectively. Samuel L. Jackson debuted poorly in sixth with his action-comedy \"The Man\" which took in a weak $4.1M on its way to just $8.3M for New Line.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"demand, children's, service, justice, universe, Ice, TV, TV, Games, &, Broadway, Calendar, President","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Covenant-Brings-Evil-to-Theaters"},{"id":"47509163292816","title":"Box Office Preview: Dupree and Little Man Bust Into Your Home","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: Dupree and Little Man Bust Into Your Homeby Gitesh Pandya | July 13, 2006 |  CommentsA pair of new star-driven comedies will try to steal away some treasure from the record-breaking hit Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest in a laugh-filled battle for the number two slot.Universal launches You, Me and Dupree starring Owen Wilson, Kate Hudson, and Matt Dillon while Sony counters with Little Man anchored by Marlon and Shawn Wayans. Neither film, though, is expected to come close to the massive second weekend haul that Johnny Depp will take away as his blockbuster sequel looks to shatter the quarter-billion mark in a mere ten days.52 weeks after Wedding Crashers opened to stellar business, Owen Wilson returns to the big screen playing a slacker in his mid-thirties who moves in with his best friend and his wife who are a newlywed couple. The PG-13 film stars Hudson and Dillon as the lucky duo while Michael Douglas plays the father to Hudson’s character. The date crowd will be the primary audience here and like most romantic comedies, Dupree should skew a little more female. However, the starpower and the concept give the film solid male appeal so both genders should show interest which will be important. Though formulaic and predictable as can be, the Universal release does offer up lots of laughs which will work with audiences willing to check their brain at the door.As the anchor, Wilson has seen his share of box office hits, especially when there are other stars surrounding him. The R-rated Wedding Crashers with Vince Vaughn bowed to $33.9M this weekend a year ago, 2004’s Starsky and Hutch with Ben Stiller opened to $28.1M, and his last Jackie Chan action-comedy Shanghai Knights debuted to $19.6M. The blonde funnyman plays the exact same character for the umpteenth time, but somehow audiences keep buying it.June has served up a steady diet of hit comedies like The Break-Up, Click, and The Devil Wears Prada so audiences are certainly not starving for a laugh right now. Competition will be tough and Little Man’s arrival will take away some folks looking for a chuckle too. Even Pirates, which packs a hundred laughs into its two-and-a-half-hour package, will be a factor. But Dupree does offer four big and likable stars even if Douglas has been underutilized in the marketing campaign. The plot has come across very clear in the advertising which is crucial. And the same audience that powered March’s Failure to Launch to a $24.4M opening could be out once again for this one. Making itself comfortable in 3,131 locations, You, Me and Dupree could gross around $22M this weekend.For the fourth time in seven summers, the Wayans brothers regroup for some raunchy fun in Little Man opening this Friday. Keenan is once again at the helm while younger siblings Marlon and Shawn take to the screen in another high concept story. This time, a pint-sized criminal disguises himself as a toddler in order to uncover a stolen diamond from an unsuspecting couple. CGI allows Marlon to become a little man and laughter ensues. The Wayans clan last hit theaters two years ago in White Chicks which opened to $19.6M and a five-day $27.2M take. Little Man’s plot is not as catchy as Chick’s, but much of their loyal fan base is still likely to give it a try.Sony has been pushing its latest summer comedy heavily, but with so many other laughers in the marketplace right now, some of the audience will get split. The Wayans team has always had a strong urban following which will once again be out in solid numbers. Waist Deep has been the only summer film anchored by black stars so an underserved audience is sure to come out and drive ticket sales. With about 600 fewer theaters than Dupree, Little Man is likely to find itself debuting in third place with an average that will challenge Owen’s. Poor reviews should not make a difference and a PG-13 rating will open the doors to a large teen crowd that might find Dupree to be too mature. Hiding out in 2,533 theaters, Little Man could make off with about $18M over the weekend.Dead Man’s Chest set off the kind of box office fireworks last weekend that the industry has never seen before with a towering $135.6M opening and a per-theater average of nearly $33,000 from more than 4,000 locations. Despite its popularity, the Disney smash is bound to see a substantial drop this time coming off of such a large number. Spider-Man, which previously held the record for the largest opening weekend, dropped only 38% in its second session in May 2002 while fellow megahit Star Wars Episode III fell 49%. However, the webslinger was not a sequel and did not have Thursday night preview grosses during its debut frame, and the final Jedi flick had the Memorial Day holiday prevent its decline from surging too high.Even though audiences are happy with Johnny Depp and his motley crew in their second adventure, big budget summer sequels like Chest are made to erode quickly. Plus with no holiday or expansion to soften the blow, sales could get sliced in half and then some. Weekday sales have been red hot with the Davy Jones pic looting $18.1M on Monday and $15.7M on Tuesday. By the end of its first full week in theaters, Disney should have more than $190M in its chest. A weekend fall to about $66M would give Pirates the third largest sophomore weekend gross in history after Shrek 2 ($72.2M) and Spider-Man ($71.4M). Coincidentally, all three franchises will launch their third installments next May. After only ten days, Captain Jack Sparrow would drink down an amazing $261M worth of rum.Superman Returns has been completely overshadowed by Pirates. Its 59% sophomore fall last weekend was troubling but this weekend’s decline should stabilize to around 50%. No new action films will be opening which is good news to Warner Bros. A weekend gross of about $11M would give the Man of Steel $163M in 19 days.Meryl Streep‘s The Devil Wears Prada is likely to see more competition from Dupree than from Little Man.this weekend. A 40% drop would give Fox a weekend take of about $9M and a 17-day cume of $81M surpassing the $71.4M of 2001’s Bridget Jones’s Diary which was also based on a best-selling book.LAST YEAR: Starting an annual tradition, Johnny Depp was the handsome groom and Owen Wilson settled for the best man spot at the mid-July box office. The dashing pirate reteamed with his favorite filmmaker Tim Burton for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which opened impressively at number one with a $56.2M debut. The Warner Bros. remake would go on to collect $206.5M domestically and over $470M worldwide. Premiering in its shadow at number two was Wedding Crashers starring Wilson and one of his favorite co-stars Vince Vaughn. The New Line sleeper smash bowed to $33.9M but enjoyed amazing legs and eventually outperformed Charlie in North America with $209.2M. The global gross reached a terrific $285M. Dropping 59% to third place was Fantastic Four with $22.8M in its sophomore frame for Fox. More effects-driven actioners rounded out the top five. Paramount’s War of the Worlds grossed $15.2M and Batman Begins captured $6M for Warners.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Oscars, rt, Sundance, competition, Rocky, Brie, VH1, Marvel, Tarantino, cartoon, The","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Dupree-and-Little-Man-Bust-Into-Your-Home"},{"id":"47509161706636","title":"Box Office Preview: Miami Vice Turns Up B.O.

Heatby Gitesh Pandya | July 27, 2006 |  CommentsWith cops, drug dealers, and lots of bullets flying, the action film Miami Vice hits theaters across North America this weekend with its aim squarely on the number one spot. Young kids, meanwhile, will be offered another animated film in the form of The Ant Bully while teens get a new high school comedy in John Tucker Must Die. The overall box office should continue to be much healthier than last year as the Jack Sparrow-dominated month of July comes to a close.Universal can smell a number-one opening in the air tonight. The studio hopes to claim bragging rights to the film that finally knocks Pirates out of the top spot with its action thriller Miami Vice. Directed by Michael Mann, the R-rated pic stars Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell in a loose update of the hit NBC cop show from the 1980s. Gong Li co-stars in this story of an undercover operation into the workings of a South American drug lord. In a summer full of Kryptonian heroes, pirates, and mutant villains, moviegoers are ready for a standard action film, set in modern times, with big stars playing the bad-ass good guys. With the tame PG-13 actioners behind us, Miami Vice ups the volume on violence and doesn’t hold back when it comes to gun battles and the offing of bad guys.Vice has racked up some of the best reviews of any summer action film this year which should help in selling the pic to older adults. Though Mann stumbled with 2001’s Ali, the director has been pretty solid with the films he’s delivered over the past decade with Collateral, The Insider, and Heat. This new film’s leads will be the driving force at the box office. Both are hip and cool enough to appeal to teens as well as adults. The men exude plenty of sex appeal which will aid in drawing in women, plus Foxx has tremendous pull with African-American moviegoers who should be out in large numbers. Universal’s marketing has been as slick and cool as can be and makes the film seem like a necessary investment for action movie fans.Miami Vice looks to appeal to the same audiences as a pair of action titles from the summer of 2003. Bad Boys II was another R-rated, star-driven, cop buddy picture set in Miami and bowed to $46.5M with a $14,602 average that July. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence made for a more potent commercial combo at the cash registers plus the sequel boasted plenty of comedy and already had a large built-in fan following. The next month, Farrell scored his fourth number-one opening of that year starring in another remake of an old cop show by teaming up with Samuel L. Jackson for S.W.A.T. The PG-13 film debuted on top with $37.1M and a $11,575 average.Detectives Crockett and Tubbs will bring a breath of fresh air to a marketplace that is ready to move on from the record-breaking pirate shenanigans. Older teens and adult moviegoers are ready to see something else, and for now, this is it. Busting into 3,020 theaters, Miami Vice could debut with about $38M this weekend.A ten-year-old boy gets miniaturized and becomes one with an insect colony in The Ant Bully, a new toon from Warner Bros. Young kids and their parents are the target audience here as the studio is aiming for the summer vacation crowd with this PG-rated adventure. An impressive voice cast that includes Julia Roberts, Nicolas Cage, and Meryl Streep might attract some biz and throwing in the name of producer Tom Hanks won’t hurt either. But Bully is going after the exact same audience as last week’s rival toon Monster House so the pie will get split. Neither is being treated as a must-see from a well-known franchise. Like Sony’s kidpic, Bully also will be playing in select 3D theaters as Imax is on board with a special run in their locations. The added value will certainly intrigue some families. Reviews are weak, but these films really rely on the ratio of nagging from kids to the willingness to give in by parents. Invading 3,050 sites, The Ant Bully might debut to around $15M.High school hijinks are at the core of the new comedy John Tucker Must Die which finds Jesse Metcalfe playing the title character, a teen romeo that juggles three girlfriends who learn of the infidelity and plot their revenge. The PG-13 pic comes from director Betty Thomas (Dr. Dolittle, Private Parts) and co-stars Ashanti, Brittany Snow, and Jenny McCarthy. Teenage girls will make up the target audience but with limited starpower, Tucker’s potential should be limited as well. The Fox film will be going up against a handful of comedies currently clogging up screens in multiplexes. Young females not of age to buy a Vice ticket, or just uninterested in that shoot-em-up cop pic, will take interest in the female revenge story of Tucker. Some interest from teen guys could be there too, but the post-college crowd is not likely to donate many bills. The marketing push has been decent and a bold title will get some attention. Opening in 2,561 locations, John Tucker Must Die might take in about $9M this weekend.Woody Allen seems to have loved working with Scarlett Johansson in London so much with the Oscar-nominated Match Point that he went for round two in his latest film Scoop which opens in moderate national release on Friday. The Focus title features the young starlet playing an American journalism student who gets the inside track on uncovering the identity of a serial killer from the spirit of a deceased reporter. Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, and Allen himself co-star in the PG-13 flick. Critics have not been kind as reviews so far have been weak which will impact the box office significantly. Die-hard Woody fans won’t be swayed, but other upscale moviegoers will be affected. Scoop enters 537 theaters this weekend and might collect about $2M.Fox Searchlight platformed its Sundance darling Little Miss Sunshine on Wednesday ahead of a gradual national roll-out that will continue into late August. The R-rated film about a dysfunctional family that takes a road trip to enter their young daughter in a beauty contest stars Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, and Alan Arkin. Sunshine wowed audiences in Park City and won a reported $10M distribution deal from the Fox subsidiary. Armed with glowing reviews across the board, the comedy from the husband-wife directing team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris should score a sizzling average from its seven theaters in New York and Los Angeles. Long-term prospects also seem bright as Sunshine should play out as the indie alternative to a summer of mindless popcorn flick.Kings lose crowns and this weekend Johnny Depp looks to give up his title as three-time ruler of the box office. Still, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest has been holding up well during the week and Miami Vice is the only new film to make a serious dent in its treasure chest. Another drop of 45% would give Disney about $19M for the session boosting the overall domestic haul to a mammoth $357M.Sony’s animated adventure Monster House got off to a strong start last weekend with a $22.2M bow, but will face head-to-head competition from Ant Bully this weekend which will be looking to kick some sand in its face. A 40% fall would leave House with around $13M and a ten-day total of $45M.M. Night Shyamalan‘s latest thriller Lady in the Water debuted below expectations last week and will be entering its all-important sophomore frame. If history is any indicator, the grosses should see a steep drop. Second weekend declines for the director’s last three films have been 68% for 2004’s The Village, 51% for 2002’s Signs, and 52% for 2000’s Unbreakable. Lady may not sink the way Village did as it seems to be generating both love-it and hate-it camps. Still, with such a low starting point, and Crockett and Tubbs stealing away adults, a fall of at least 50% could be in order. That would give the bedtime story roughly $9M and a cume of $34M in ten days.LAST YEAR: After two weeks at number one and two respectively, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Wedding Crashers swapped places with the Owen Wilson–Vince Vaughn comedy taking over at the top with $20M, slipping a mere 22%. The Johnny Depp kidpic followed with $16.4M in its third frame. Newcomers filled up the rest of the top five. Leading the way was Disney’s super hero family film Sky High with $14.6M on its way to a solid $63.9M. Close behind were Sony’s action flop Stealth with $13.3M and the Warner Bros. romantic comedy Must Love Dogs wth $12.9M. Final grosses reached $31.7M and $43.9M, respectively.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Pacific, America, female, docudrama, fiction, of, Critics, Winter, marvel, movie, Max, anime, Hallmark, Mindy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Miami-Vice-Turns-Up-BO-Heat"},{"id":"47509161700489","title":"Box Office Preview: \"World Trade Center\" Arrives in Theaters","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: \"World Trade Center\" Arrives in Theatersby Gitesh Pandya | August 10, 2006 |  CommentsAnother frame packed with four new national releases is led by Oliver Stone‘s 9/11 drama \"World Trade Center\" from Paramount. A trio of lower profile pics round out the weekend – Sony’s family adventure \"Zoom,\" Buena Vista’s teen drama \"Step Up,\" and The Weinstein Company’s horror flick \"Pulse.\" Despite all the new entries, Will Ferrell will try to win the box office title for the second consecutive time with his comedy \"Talladega Nights\" which has been racing well ahead of its competition since opening last weekend.Nicolas Cage, Michael Pena, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Maria Bello star in the high-profile story of courage \"World Trade Center\" which Paramount debuted on Wednesday. The PG-13 film tells the real life story of John McLoughlin and William Jimeno, two Port Authority cops who were trapped in the rubble of the Twin Towers on September 11. Rather than focus on any villains, \"WTC\" only tells the story of ordinary men put into extraordinary circumstances and how their families coped. Mature adults will make up the primary audience. Teen appeal seems limited. Since the box office is currently lacking choices for older adults, the Oliver Stone film will not face much direct competition. Men and women will be equally drawn to this emotionally-charged story of heroism.There will be many moviegoers that will find it to be too soon for a film about a tragedy just approaching its fifth anniversary. However, curiousity will bring out others looking for an uplifting story about that fateful Tuesday morning. \"WTC\" should appeal to many of the same people who turned out for 2004’s \"Ladder 49.\" That film featured Cage’s \"Face/Off\" nemesis John Travolta as a noble firefighter and just told a tale about American heroes doing the right thing for each other, and not really dwelling on any enemy. \"Ladder\" bowed to $22.1M over three days.Center will also be compared to April’s United 93 which was the first Hollywood film to tackle 9/11. With a subdued release in under 1,800 locations, that pic opened well with $11.5M and a solid $6,395 average. \"WTC\" has more theaters, more starpower in front of and behind the camera, and is not as grim. Reviews have mostly been good which will help. Long-term prospects are encouraging since the rest of August has nothing major for mature adults. Now playing in 2,803 theaters, \"World Trade Center\" might open with about $18M over the weekend and around $24M over five days.Tim Allen plays an ex-super hero who is called upon to train a group of slacker kids in Sony’s new family film \"Zoom.\" The PG-rated pic will have plenty of competition as it marks the fourth consecutive week that studios have rolled out movies aimed at young ones. Only this time, it isn’t a toon. Allen has always been a consistent draw in this genre, most notably in his \"Santa Clause\" movies which sees its third installment this coming holiday season. Earlier this year, he starred in the Disney remake \"The Shaggy Dog\" which bowed to $16.3M in March. \"Zoom,\" which co-stars Courteney Cox and Chevy Chase, will not reach that level as it is not generating as much excitement. Plus the volume on the marketing push has been typical of a mid-August opener. Flying into 2,501 theaters, \"Zoom\" might debut with around $9M.Hollywood seems to have written a new rule stating that 9/11 films must be counter-programmed with teen-girl pics that explore popular extracurricular activities. \"United 93\" opened against the gymnastics comedy \"Stick It,\" and now \"WTC\" will face Buena Vista’s \"Step Up\" which finds a ballerina and a tough street dancer locking hips. The PG-13 film will play primarily to young females and the studio is hoping to score another low-cost hit like Disney’s April comedy which debuted to a better-than-expected $10.8M. \"Step Up\" lacks marquee stars, but does offer some faces that add value when it comes to the Clearasil crowd. The bad boy meets good girl formula is once again tested and little crossover to older patrons is likely. Competition for teens and young adults is ample so a breakout bow may not surface, but a respectable showing is likely. Dancing into 2,100 theaters, \"Step Up\" could debut to around $8M.Supernatural beasties attack us innocent humans through cell phones and email in the new horror flick \"Pulse.\" The PG-13 film is aimed at teens that have seen every other film and want some quick thrills before heading back to school. With no major stars, and a concept that is far from intriguing, the Weinstein Co. release should be in for some modest dollars over the weekend. \"The Descent\" will be \"Pulse’s\" major foe, but like most fright flicks, the chicks-in-a-cave movie should tumble down further on the charts in its second weekend. \"Step Up\" and \"Talladega Nights\" will also be distracting teens. Opening in 2,326 theaters, \"Pulse\" might scare up about $8M this weekend.In foreign film releases, Yash Raj Films opens the all-star Bollywood film \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" (Never Say Goodbye) in top markets across North America. Shot in New York, the Hindi-language film explores the breakdown of marital bonds. Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro (\"Central Station\") headlines \"The House of Sand\" which Sony Classics platforms in New York and Los Angeles this Friday. The story of three generations of women in the barren lands of northern Brazil played at the Tribeca Film Festival and will roll out into more cities throughout the rest of summer.Last weekend’s box office champ \"Talladega Nights\" hopes to retain its crown in its second lap. The Will Ferrell hit is sure to see a large decline, but competition for teens and young adults is not too fierce. A 50% drop would leave Sony with about $23M for the session and a solid ten-day cume of $92M. Paramount’s \"Barnyard\" may fall by 40% and rake in around $9.5M pushing its total to $33M after ten days. The Johnny Depp megasmash \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest\" could drop by another 40% to $6.5M lifting its jaw-dropping total to $392M.LAST YEAR: Director John Singleton scored a top spot debut with his revenge thriller \"Four Brothers\" which debuted with $21.2M. Paramount found its way to $74.5M with the Mark Wahlberg drama. Opening in second was the Kate Hudson suspense thriller \"The Skeleton Key\" with $16.1M on its way to $47.8M for Universal. Falling from first to third was the comedy \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" with $13M dropping a steep 58% from its bow. Rival comedy \"Wedding Crashers\" held up much better easing 26% in its fifth frame to $11.8M. Opening in fifth place with $9.6M was Sony’s comedy sequel \"Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo\" which ended its run with just $22.3M. The weekend’s other new release, the military drama \"The Great Raid,\" opened modestly in tenth with only $3.4M on its way to $10.2M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"spain, Sundance, tv, crime, on, Watching, breaking, Summer, SundanceTV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-World-Trade-Center-Arrives-in-Theaters"},{"id":"47509163311253","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Sandler Fast Forwards to #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Sandler Fast Forwards to #1by Gitesh Pandya | June 25, 2006 |  CommentsMoviegoers grabbed their remote controls and flocked to the multiplexes this weekend to see Adam Sandler‘s latest comedy Click which became the comedian’s eighth number one hit thanks to its $40M opening, according to estimates.Sony launched the PG-13 film in 3,749 theaters and averaged a healthy $10,670 per location. It was the second best opening of the year for a live-action comedy after the $40.2M bow of Scary Movie 4 in April. With this latest film, the funnyman has become the only actor to score $30M+ openings in each of the last five years proving what a consistent box office draw he continues to be. A-listers like Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Jim Carrey cannot claim the same feat.In Sandler’s latest vehicle, he plays a man who gets a magical remote control that gives him power over all others around him. Frank Coraci, who directed the comedian’s 1998 hits The Wedding Singer and The Waterboy, helmed this latest pic which co-starred Kate Beckinsale, Christopher Walken, and David Hasselhoff. Sony’s $83M production played to a broad audience. According to studio research, 51% of the crowd was female and 50% were under 25. Sandler has always been a strong draw with young guys, but with his role as a husband and father in Click, the actor was able to appeal evenly across the board to all four quadrants.Reviews were poor, as expected, but audiences didn’t seem to care. Click is a marketing-driven film and starpower and concept sold it to those looking for some harmless summer laughs. The opening was right in the middle of the $37-43M range that five of Sandler’s previous comedies have debuted in. With the Fourth of July holiday coming up, Click could very well go on to become the star’s seventh $100M blockbuster.Following its two-week run in the top spot, the animated comedy Cars slipped to second place but displayed solid staying power. The G-rated film eased only 33% to an estimated $22.5M pushing the 17-day total to $155.9M. The decline was smaller than the third-weekend drops experienced by the most recent Disney/Pixar films The Incredibles (47% in November 2004) and Finding Nemo (39% in June 2003). Despite opening weaker, Cars is now holding up better and continues to benefit from word-of-mouth from family audiences. After 17 days of release, Cars is running 12% behind the pace of Incredibles and 19% behind Nemo. Competition for kids from Superman and Pirates in the weeks ahead will be fierce, but the racing toon could still drive to a final domestic haul of over $240M making it bigger than any other film released up to this point in the year.After a stellar opening, the Jack Black comedy Nacho Libre stumbled 57% and placed third with an estimated $12.1M. Paramount has grossed a solid $52.7M in ten days and is heading for the $70-80M range. Nacho cost $35M to produce.Tyrese Gibson flexed some muscle with his new actioner Waist Deep which opened impressively in fourth with an estimated $9.5M from just 1,004 theaters. The Focus Features release averaged a sizzling $9,414 per location. Reviews for the kidnapping drama were mostly negative, but audiences responded to the starpower and the action.Slamming on the brakes, the action sequel The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift suffered the worst decline in the top ten crashing 62% to an estimated $9.2M in its sophomore frame. With $42.6M in its tank, Universal’s $75M franchise pic has been performing exactly like another of the studio’s recent June action sequels – 2004’s Vin Diesel pic The Chronicles of Riddick. That film opened to a similar $24.3M, dropped 61% in the second frame, and generated a ten-day cume of $42.5M before finishing with $57.6M. Tokyo Drift should cross the finish line near the $60M mark as well.The franchise’s last installment, 2003’s 2 Fast 2 Furious, performed in the same way tumbling 63% in its second lap so Drift’s huge drop was expected. Overseas, the latest street racing pic remained at number one in the United Kingdom for a second straight weekend and pushed its international gross to $15.6M from a dozen countries. The studio projected number one openings this weekend in Indonesia, Finland, Portugal, Romania, and Trinidad. Japan, expected to be a big market for Tokyo Drift, does not open until September 18.The Keanu Reeves–Sandra Bullock romance The Lake House enjoyed a reasonably good second date grossing an estimated $8.3M dropping 39%. After ten days, the Warner Bros. drama has taken in $29.2M and looks headed for the neighborhood of $60M. Lake bowed at number two in the U.K. this weekend with an estimated $1.5M from 343 locations. The film’s international roll-out will be spread out over the coming months.Holding up well in seventh place was another film targeting adult women, The Break-Up starring Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn. The Universal release grossed an estimated $6.1M, off only 38%, for a $103.7M cume. The unromantic comedy became the seventh film of 2006 to cross the $100M mark. Eight films had joined the century club at this point last year.Fox’s kidpic sequel Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties dropped just 35% in its second weekend and collected an estimated $4.8M. With a mere $16M in ten days, the PG-rated film looks to reach a disappointing $30M domestically or less than half of the $75.4M of its 2004 predecessor.The year’s two highest-grossing films rounded out the top ten. Fox’s X-Men: The Last Stand took in an estimated $4.4M, down 44%, pushing its cume to $224.1M. The Da Vinci Code grossed an estimated $4M, off only 24%, giving Sony $205.5M to date. Collectively, the top five summer films have grossed $861.6M trailing last summer’s corresponding blockbusters by 5% at this same point in the season.Two summer hits fell from the top ten over the weekend. Paramount’s release of the DreamWorks animated film Over the Hedge grabbed an estimated $2.7M this weekend. Off 37%, the PG-rated toon boosted its total to $144.5M and should reach around $152M by the end of its run. Fox’s remake of The Omen has had no legs and tumbled another 63% to an estimated $2.1M this weekend. The $25M film has scared up a solid $52M and looks to end with about $55M.Paramount Vantage kept expanding its global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth which widened from 403 to 514 theaters this weekend and grossed an estimated $1.9M. Averaging a decent $3,762 per site, the Al Gore pic has upped its sum to $9.5M and counting. Further expansions are planned for the coming weeks.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"cinematic, high, Wars, science, YouTube, quibi, 2017, Apple, Annual, The, your, Premium, potter, criterion","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Sandler-Fast-Forwards-to-1"},{"id":"47509161703563","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Miami Vice\" Knocks Pirates From #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Miami Vice\" Knocks Pirates From #1 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | July 31, 2006 |  CommentsDetectives Crockett and Tubbs shot their way to number one in North America with the cop thriller Miami Vice which finally managed to knock the megablockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest out of the top spot.The new teen comedy John Tucker Must Die debuted well but the animated entry The Ant Bully got squashed in its opening weekend. Overall, the box office saw a summer slowdown as the top ten films attracted the weakest sales since early May.Universal hit the top of the charts with its big-budget actioner Miami Vice which opened with an estimated $25.2M. Starring Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell as the famous South Florida cops from the hit 1980s television series, the R-rated film averaged a strong $8,340 from 3,021 theaters. The debut was in line with the opening of director Michael Mann‘s last film Collateral which was also an R-rated actioner and bowed to $24.7M in August 2004. That film, which starred Tom Cruise and Foxx, eventually squeaked past the $100M mark domestically. The studio reported that the audience for Miami Vice was older, multicultural, and evenly split between men and women. Studio research showed that a high 62% of the crowd was age 30 and older, 51% was male, and 52% was non-white. Reviews were mixed for the $135M production.After three weeks of ruling the box office, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest dropped to second place but still posted strong results grossing an estimated $20.5M. The Disney smash dropped only 42% and propelled its cume to a staggering $358.4M after just 24 days. More records were looted by Captain Jack Sparrow. Chest became the fastest film in history to sail past the $350M mark doing so on Saturday in only 23 days. Shrek 2 held the record previously with 26 days in 2004. The Pirates sequel also stands as the top-grossing movie ever for its studio surpassing the $339.7M of 2003’s Finding Nemo.The middle film in the swashbuckling adventure trilogy vaulted to number 11 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters right behind the $370.3M of 2004’s The Passion of the Christ. Pirates has also put an end to the industry’s seven-year streak of the top-grossing summer film coming out of the month of May. Johnny Depp and friends have completely dominated the moviegoing world this month as no other film since has opened north of $30M. The last time the month of July saw only one $30M+ opener was ten years ago when Independence Day ruled the mid-summer box office in 1996. Dead Man’s Chest looks to smash the $400M mark in the weeks ahead.Teenagers pushed the high school comedy John Tucker Must Die into the number three spot with an estimated opening of $14.1M. Bowing in 2,560 theaters, the PG-13 film about a group of young women who get revenge on the guy secretly dating all of them averaged a solid $5,498 per site. However, sales plunged a disturbing 24% on Saturday from a strong Friday turnout indicating there could be trouble ahead. Still, with no pricey stars, Tucker should become a nice little hit for Fox. The studio’s divide-and-conquer marketing approach seems to have worked. Television spots aimed at females focused on the revenge-on-a-cheating-boy angle while those targeting males showed off the title character’s ability to juggle three chicks.Sony’s digital toon Monster House dropped 48% in its second weekend to an estimated $11.5M and raised its total to $43.9M after ten days. The $75M film looks to find its way to a relatively good $65-70M.Warner Bros. stumbled with the opening of its rival kid toon The Ant Bully which finished the weekend in fifth place with an estimated $8.1M. Playing in 3,050 locations, the PG-rated adventure about a boy who enters the world of insects averaged a weak $2,670 per location. Big-time Hollywood stars Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep, and Nicolas Cage provided the voices, but audiences were not swayed. Bully’s opening weekend couldn’t even beat the second weekend of Monster House. The kidpic market will get even more crowded on Friday when Paramount launches its own animated film Barnyard targeting the exact same family audience once again.Sixth place was too close to call with a pair of films claiming an estimated $7M in ticket stubs this weekend. Universal’s comedy You, Me and Dupree fell 45% in its third weekend and boosted its 17-day cume to a solid $59M.However, M. Night Shyamalan‘s bedtime story Lady in the Water followed its weak opening weekend with a steep 61% crash and gave Warner Bros. a feeble $32.1M in ten days. By comparison, ten-day totals for the filmmaker’s last films have been $85.6M for 2004’s The Village and $117.7M for 2002’s Signs. Lady, which is not even in the same ballpark, has not excited audiences and it could stumble to a final tally of about $45M making its entire total smaller than the opening weekend of his last film.It’s been a difficult summer for Warners. First, its costly ocean liner actioner Poseidon flopped grossing $100M less than its production budget. Then Superman Returns, the most expensive movie ever, did not live up to expectations. Now the studio is suffering a double blow with Lady and Ant Bully both being ignored by moviegoers. Of course, overseas box office and worldwide home video will add more revenue, but expensive marketing campaigns will make it hard for these films to become moneymaking ventures. The studio’s other summer film The Lake House has enjoyed a respectable run though, grossing $51M.Sony’s Wayans brothers comedy Little Man placed eighth with an estimated $5.1M, down 54%, and raised its sum to a decent $50.2M. Meryl Streep followed with the sleeper hit of the summer, The Devil Wears Prada, which grossed an estimated $4.8M. Off only 35%, the Fox hit pushed its total to $106.7M.Crumbling 61% to an estimated $3.9M in its sophomore session, Kevin Smith‘s Clerks II rounded out the top ten and put its ten-day cume at $18.5M. The inexpensive $5M production should continue to fade fast, but looks to end with around $25M making it a nice little moneymaker for MGM and The Weinstein Company. Smith’s last summer film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back dropped a hefty 53% in its second weekend in 2001 although the Labor Day holiday frame helped to cushion the blow.Opening in platform release to sensational results was Fox Searchlight’s indie comedy Little Miss Sunshine which bowed to an estimated $357,000 from only seven theaters for an eye-popping $50,980 average. Since its Wednesday launch in New York and Los Angeles, the R-rated comedy starring Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, and Alan Arkin has grossed $449,000. Sunshine was the hottest film at this year’s Sundance Film Festival and the distrib is now looking to turn it into a strong word-of-mouth hit for moviegoers numbed by all the mindless popcorn films of the summer. Reviews were outstanding and the road comedy will continue to expand in the weeks ahead. The distributor plans to widen to ten cities and about 60 theaters this Friday, 175 playdates the following weekend, and a full national release in over 600 sites on August 18.Also debuting this weekend was Woody Allen’s latest film Scoop with an estimated $3M from 538 locations for a good $5,582 average. The Focus release stars Scarlett Johannson and Hugh Jackman and earned mixed reviews from critics.Three films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. Superman Returns fell 49% to an estimated $3.8M in its fifth mission and reached a cume of $185.8M. After 33 days of release last summer, Warner Bros. collected a similar $183.1M with its other super hero revival Batman Begins. However, the Caped Crusader posted a stronger $6M frame, ranked higher with a fifth place finish, and was enjoying smaller weekly declines on its way to $205.3M. With a reported production budget north of $240M, Superman Returns is on a course to end its domestic run with roughly $195M and will need some sort of special re-release in order to cross the double-century mark.Fox also grabbed an estimated $3.8M with its super hero comedy My Super Ex-Girlfriend which tumbled 56% in its second weekend. With a weak $16.4M in ten days, the Uma Thurman–Luke Wilson comedy should find its way to only $25M.Disney watched Pixar’s durable toon hit Cars become the second highest-grossing film of the year this weekend. The G-rated smash fell 50% to an estimated $2.5M boosting its cume to $234.6M surpassing the third X-Men flick. Add in the recent Pirates sequel and the Mouse House can now claim the two biggest box office hits of 2006 with no other films in the near future looking to get in their way.Al Gore‘s global warming hit An Inconvenient Truth became only the fourth documentary in box office history to cross the $20M mark this weekend. The Paramount Vantage title took in an estimated $773,000 in its tenth frame, off 23%, to lift its cume to $20.2M. The only docs to score better have been Fahrenheit 9/11 ($119.2M), March of the Penguins ($77.4M), and Bowling for Columbine ($21.6M).The top ten films grossed an estimated $107.3M which was up a scant 2% from last year when Wedding Crashers climbed to number one in its third weekend with $20M; but down 22% from 2004 when The Village opened in the top spot with $50.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"thriller, Adult, Chernobyl, First","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Miami-Vice-Knocks-Pirates-From-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509163352222","title":"Box Office Preview: X-Men 3 Ready to Rock Memorial Day Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: X-Men 3 Ready to Rock Memorial Day Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | May 25, 2006 |  CommentsWolverine, Professor X, and the rest of their soul patrol will launch a full-scale attack on the North American box office this weekend as the gargantuan comic book film X-Men: The Last Stand invades the marketplace on Friday ready to dominate the long Memorial Day holiday weekend.Rival studios have ceded the frame to the much anticipated Fox sequel as no other film will open in wide release. But with the religious thriller The Da Vinci Code coming off of a spectacular opening, and the animated hit Over the Hedge doing well with family audiences, it should be a very busy four-day weekend at the megaplexes as all types of moviegoers will have something worth spending money on.The world’s favorite mutants embark on what could be their final mission in X-Men: The Last Stand which has its eyes set on breaking the opening weekend record for the Memorial Day frame. After directing the first two successful installments, Bryan Singer jumped ship to helm Superman Returns opening up the director’s chair on Stand for Brett Ratner (Rush Hour, Red Dragon). All the primary cast members have returned including Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Rebecca Romijn, and Anna Paquin. Kelsey Grammer joins the cast playing Beast.The X-Men franchise has grown in size throughout this decade. After the demise of the Batman franchise in 1997, the comic book genre seemed dead until the first X-Men arrived in July of 2000 with a powerful $54.5M bow firmly planting Marvel in the feature film business. Three years later, Fox plugged the sequel X2: X-Men United into the prominent first weekend of May slot and blasted off to the tune of $85.6M. Final domestic grosses reached $157.3M and $214.9M respectively and with video and television, the franchise lured in more and more converts. Unlike most of 2003’s other summer action sequels like Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle, X2 was a second installment that was even more popular than the first making fans crave yet another film in the series.X-Men remains one of the top comic properties around and speculation that this will be the final installment will make fans not want to miss out. Between the escalating actor salaries and the heavy dependence on expensive special effects, Fox and Marvel Entertainment probably couldn’t afford to bankroll an X-Men 4 even if they wanted to. With the Star Wars prequels having finished up and this franchise closing up shop soon, Fox is looking to squeeze every dime it can out of The Last Stand. Its next big super hero flick won’t take off until June 15 of next year when Fantastic Four 2 hits screens a cool six weeks after Sony’s Spider-Man 3. It’s no surprise then why Fox is rolling out its tentpole pic in almost every major market around the world this weekend.For this weekend, X-Men has a secret weapon in its arsenal which should propel its numbers at the box office – teens. Studios have not done a good job over the last several weeks in exciting the most desirable of all age groups. MI3, Poseidon, and The Da Vinci Code all skewed older leaving high school students thinking these were their parents’ summer movies. Afterall, the average 16-year-old was only six when Tom Cruise first wowed audiences in Mission: Impossible. Finally with the mutant posse, Hollywood is delivering the goods for teens and young adults offering an action-packed adventure heavy on the type of special effects and action that people are eager to pay money for. No wait-for-the-DVD here. A strong turnout from this age group should be at the core of X-Men’s success this weekend.Most folks who drove X2 past the double century mark three years ago are likely to return this time. That film had virtually no competition to deal with whereas Last Stand will face a pair of potent sophomores that could rake in over $70M combined over the four-day stretch. However, the new film has the added benefit of three years of ticket price increases, a holiday frame that should power Sunday and Monday numbers to exceptional heights, and a fan base that is likely to have grown even larger since the last film.For nine long years, Steven Spielberg‘s dinosequel The Lost World has held the record for the biggest Memorial Day weekend opening ever with a colossal $92.7M over four days including Thursday night previews. The record for the largest overall weekend tally over the frame is held by 2004’s Shrek 2 which hauled in a stunning $95.6M over four days while in its second weekend. X-Men hopes to become the first film to open to nine digits over this long holiday span.The month of May has been chock full of eye-popping four-day openings from effects-driven action films appealing to mass audiences looking to start their summer off with a bang. Four-day opening tallies in recent years include $158.4M for last year’s Star Wars Episode III, $134.3M for The Matrix Reloaded, $110.2M for Star Wars Episode II, and $85.8M for The Day After Tomorrow. The Last Stand may not have the same level of anticipation as some of those blockbusters, but it does have a loyal fan following that is ready to pounce on theaters this weekend. Fox is aiming to dominate the box office this weekend opening X-Men: The Last Stand in 3,688 theaters. The super hero extravaganza might fly off with around $108M over the four-day Friday-to-Monday holiday session setting a new industry record.With only one major studio release invading theaters, a number of smaller distributors are using the holiday frame to launch limited release titles. Yash Raj Films enters most major markets on Friday with the Bollywood release Fanaa which stars one of India’s biggest box office draws Aamir Khan. Paramount’s new specialty division Paramount Vantage opened Al Gore‘s global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth in four theaters on Wednesday. The PG-rated film chronicles the former Vice President’s mission on educating the world on environmental issues that are threatening our civilization and will expand into more markets across the country in the weeks ahead.Opening in solo houses in New York City are the Jewish road drama Shem and the Filipino thriller Cavite. HP Releasing’s Shem finds a young man traveling across Europe to find his great grandfather’s grave while Truly Indie’s Cavite is a no-budget kidnapping drama in which a man arrives in the Philippines and is forced to commit heinous deeds by a terrorist if he wants to see his family alive again. Both films open in Los Angeles later in June.Last weekend, Ron Howard‘s The Da Vinci Code opened to explosive results grossing a staggering $77.1M in its first three days. Over the holiday frame, the conspiracy thriller will benefit from adults having extra time off, a four-day span, and the fact that the only new film entering theaters will play to a somewhat different audience. However, Code generated a frontloaded bow last weekend with Friday accounting for an extraordinarily high 39% of the three-day take and Saturday sales seeing a slight dip. Fans of the book certainly rushed out on the first day to see Tom Hanks play symbologist Robert Langdon so now the film must survive having already burned through its core crowd.Studios routinely pick the weekend before the Memorial Day frame as a launching pad for their biggest blockbusters, but sophomore declines over the holiday can vary. In 2003, the much-hyped sci-fi sequel The Matrix Reloaded saw its four-day holiday gross tumble 50% from its three-day debut gross. The following year, Shrek 2 slipped just 12% while last year’s Star Wars Episode III dropped a more moderate 35%. Code does not play to a sci-fi crowd or to an audience of children so its numbers will be closely watched.The Sony smash has performed admirably during the week grossing a fantastic $8.8M on Monday, helped in part by Canada’s Victoria Day holiday, and another $6.2M on Tuesday. Code looks to crack the magical $100M mark by the end of its first full week in theaters before heading right into a sophomore frame cushioned by a holiday. Since word-of-mouth is just average, The Da Vinci Code may see its four-day take drop by 40% to around $46M. That would allow the much-talked-about film’s 11-day cume to surge to $148M.The animated comedy Over the Hedge got off to a solid start last weekend and should continue to be the leading choice for families with younger kids. A 20% drop to about $31M over four days would give Paramount $79M after 11 days. The studio’s spy sequel Mission: Impossible III looks to fall by around 35% to roughly $7M giving Tom Cruise a total of $114M. The disaster flick Poseidon could fall by the same amount to around $6M lifting the sum to $45M for Warner Bros.LAST YEAR The Memorial Day weekend box office was on fire thanks to a selection of red hot hits helping the top four films alone gross more than $200M over four days. Star Wars Episode III remained at number one for the second weekend with a commanding $70M over the Friday-to-Monday span boosting its 12-day cume to an eye-popping $270.5M. DreamWorks went after younger kids with its animated hit Madagascar which bowed to a hefty $61M to take second place while the studio’s future parent Paramount was close behind in third with the Adam Sandler comedy The Longest Yard which opened to $58.6M. The two blockbusters, which both featured Chris Rock, went on to gross $193.2M and $158.1M, respectively. More funny flicks followed with New Line’s Monster-in-Law dropping to fourth with $12.8M over the long weekend and Universal’s Kicking and Screaming taking in $6.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"game, TV, Festival, drama, America, Horror, The","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-XMen-3-Ready-to-Rock-Memorial-Day-Weekend"},{"id":"47509165496482","title":"Box Office Preview: \"Poseidon\" vs. \"Mission: Impossible III\"","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: \"Poseidon\" vs. \"Mission: Impossible III\"by Gitesh Pandya | May 11, 2006 |  CommentsThe summer movie season’s second big action contender rolls into theaters this weekend as the sinking ship flick Poseidon takes aim at last week’s Mission: Impossible III for the number one spot across North America.Two smaller new releases will aim for younger moviegoers. Lindsay Lohan lets loose her girlpower with the comedy Just My Luck while soccer boys are being courted by the sports drama Goal! The Dream Begins. With spring holdovers fading fast and the new May titles only showing so much strength, there is no guarantee that the seven-week streak of the box office beating out last year’s will continue.Warner Bros. sets sail with its first big-budget entry of the summer with Poseidon, a modern retelling of the 1972 disaster film The Poseidon Adventure. After The Perfect Storm and Troy, veteran A-list director Wolfgang Petersen is back with another pricey summer action pic reportedly spending $160M to produce this new film. Poseidon finds a group of ordinary people on a luxury cruise ship who must fight for survival after a mammoth wave capsizes the ship while at sea. Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss, and Andre Braugher star.Poseidon does work as an escapist treat for the summer season. Despite a lame beginning with the usual setup, the PG-13 film quickly kicks into the disaster scenario and becomes a non-stop action film. No hour-and-a-half of teen courting before an iceberg hits in this one. Audiences that find their way into the theaters should have a relatively good time. But getting them to buy the tickets in the first place is the challenge that Warner Bros. faces. None of the stars has much pull and the original source material isn’t exactly something that moviegoers have been clamoring to have a remake of. Plus Poseidon’s appeal to teens is not very strong making it a film that will be going after mature adults just like MI3 currently is. The direct competition should keep the sinking ship’s grosses in check.Unlike most disaster films, Poseidon comes with a trim running time of under 100 minutes which means that theaters will be able to provide an ample amount of showtimes per day. Plus, a few dozen Imax locations will open the film day and date which will add a bit to the overall tally. The studio has invested heavily in the marketing push for its first entry in the summer sweepstakes. But that has not driven excitement beyond a manageable level. May has been kind to disaster films in the past. The Day After Tomorrow bowed to $68.7M two years ago, Deep Impact opened to $41.2M in 1998, and Twister bowed exactly one decade ago to a then-shocking $41.1M. Poseidon is not hitting the marketplace on a wave of momentum the way those hits did. And with recent real-life tragedies like Hurricane Katrina and the tsunami, only so many people will have an appetite to see hundreds of innocent people drown to death on the big screen. Docking in 3,555 theaters on Friday, Poseidon could open in the neighborhood of $31M.Paparazzi magnet Lindsay Lohan stars as a lucky young gal who comes across a wave of misfortune after a magical kiss in the fantasy comedy Just My Luck. Directed by Donald Petrie (Mystic Pizza, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days), the Fox release basically has one audience in its crosshairs – readers of Us Weekly and Teen People. Yes, teenage girls and young women should make up the bulk of the audience as male appeal is lacking. Lohan brings with her a respectable box office track record. Some of her recent openings include Herbie: Fully Loaded ($12.7M after a Wednesday bow and a $3,610 average), Mean Girls ($24.4M debut, $8,606 average), and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen ($9.4M, $3,736 average). This time, Lohan has to carry the film on her shoulders with no big co-star or studio brand name to help out. A not-so-interesting plot won’t help matters.Teen girls can be a fickle audience rejecting what seem to be surefire hits and flocking to lower profile pics that speak to their generation. Stick It exceeded expectations a couple of weeks ago by connecting with this crowd. With two big action entries dominating theaters and playing to an older and more male crowd, plus RV playing to young kids, Fox does have an opportunity to connect with a group that is underserved at the moment with a star that is still very popular with the target audience. This weekend, Lohan will put her drawing power to the test with Just My Luck which opens in 2,541 theaters. An opening weekend gross of around $11M could result.A young Mexican-American man follows his dreams of playing professional soccer in Disney’s new sports drama Goal! The Dream Begins. Directed by Danny Cannon (Judge Dredd, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), the PG-rated film packs zero starpower, but offers an inspirational tale that young boys can relate to. In the United States, Hollywood films about the sport we call \"football\" typically do much better at the turnstiles than ones about what the rest of the world uses that term for. Buena Vista is not giving Goal! a big push, but rather is hoping to collect a respectable amount of business before seeing the real audience on DVD. Uplifting against-the-odds sports dramas often do well as the studio has seen in the past with Remember the Titans, Miracle, and this year’s Glory Road. However, Goal! lacks the visibility of those films and overall awareness is not too high. Opening in more than 1,000 theaters, Goal! might debut to around $4M.Last weekend, Mission: Impossible III opened below expectations to $47.7M and now runs the risk of being booted into second place in its sophomore frame. Reviews and word-of-mouth seem to be positive, however that may not provide much help this time. As a heavily-hyped action sequel, MI3 has its audience carved out already and most moviegoers have already made their minds up as to whether or not they plan to see it. This is a film made to make its money upfront. Plus Poseidon will be playing to the same audience of adults over 30 looking for an action thrill ride. A 50% drop for the Tom Cruise vehicle could leave Paramount with about $24M for the weekend and $84M in ten days. By comparison, ten-day cumes for recent summer kick-off films include $85.1M for 2004’s Van Helsing, $147.7M for 2003’s X2: X-Men United, and an eye-popping $223M for 2002’s megahit Spider-Man.Robin Williams enjoyed a solid hold for his family comedy RV last weekend. Once again, competition for kids is mild so the Sony release should see another small decline. RV may drop 30% to around $8M this weekend lifting the film’s total to $41M after 17 days.LAST YEAR: J Lo. and J Fo. went head to head in the marital comedy Monster-in-Law which opened at number one with $23.1M. New Line’s hit summer film went on to gross a solid $82.9M. Opening in second was Will Ferrell’s soccer comedy Kicking and Screaming which debuted close behind with $20.2M on its way to $52.7M for Universal. While those two new releases entered more than 3,400 theaters, another freshman title bowed in less than 2,000 sites and placed third. The Jet Li actioner Unleashed opened to $10.9M for Focus and found its way to $24.5M. Fox’s Crusades epic Kingdom of Heaven fell 51% in its second weekend dropping from first to fourth with $9.6M. Fellow sophomore Crash held up exceptionally well in fifth dipping only 23% to $7M. The frame’s final new release, the Miramax thriller Mindhunters, debuted to a weak $1.9M before limping to a $4.5M total.Author: Gitesh Pandya, BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"guild, language, Polls, park, Searchlight, of, Lucasfilm, composers, disaster","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Poseidon-vs-Mission-Impossible-III"},{"id":"47509163338906","title":"Box Office Preview: \"Cars\" Battles \"Omen\" at Theaters","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: \"Cars\" Battles \"Omen\" at Theatersby Gitesh Pandya | June 8, 2006 |  CommentsRacing into theaters across North America, the computer animated film Cars aims to take over pole position this weekend targeting family audiences. Those looking for a good scare can instead choose The Omen which already launched on Tuesday with some frightening results. The frame’s final new wide release is the Robert Altman comedy A Prairie Home Companion giving the weekend a wide assortment of titles for all audiences.After a surprising top spot debut, the Vince Vaughn–Jennifer Aniston comedy The Break-Up will surely fall from grace, but should still remain a formidable contender.After a near-break-up of their own, Disney and Pixar are back together again in a committed relationship and have put their full parental support behind Cars which zooms into the marketplace on Friday with some red hot buzz. Directed by Pixar guru John Lasseter (Toy Story, Toy Story 2), the G-rated film tells the story of a cocky race car who gets lost in a small town on the way to the big championship and meets a colorful group of vehicles who teach him some morals. Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy all lend their voices.Recent Pixar films have been spaced out evenly using the Harry Potter year-and-a-half policy. In November 2001, Monsters, Inc. opened to $62.6M and was followed by Finding Nemo with $70.3M in May 2003 and The Incredibles with $70.5M in November 2004. The timing is just enough to make each film a new event of its own that generates excitement among fans of all ages. Disney’s marketing and cross-promotional efforts have been loud as usual and awareness is sky high. But Cars does have a longer running time than most toons clocking in at nearly two hours. Maybe all eight of the credited writers demanded that their bits make the final cut.Disney has had only two number one hits so far this year, ruling the Dr. King and Presidents’ Day holiday weekends with Glory Road and Eight Below, respectively. This weekend, the third trophy should be in the bag as anticipation among boys and girls alike is high. Business from teens and adults should be solid as well since the Pixar brand name attracts millions of loyal followers of all types. Plus, NASCAR fans are sure to provide an additional push at the turnstiles. The only major competition will come from Over the Hedge which is now fading into its fourth weekend. It’s an open highway for Cars which races into over 3,800 theaters this weekend. A three-day tally of about $72M could result.Three decades after the original terrorized movie fans, The Omen has been reborn with today’s stars and special effects in the Fox release which opened on Tuesday, 6/6/06. With horror fans now used to a steady string of remakes of fright classics, the novelty has worn thin. So, to make this one stand out, the studio plugged the R-rated film into the unorthodox Tuesday slot to take advantage of the Satan-style date which in turn became the focal point of the marketing campaign. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead, and The Amityville Horror were all recent remakes that shot straight to number one. With The Omen, something new was needed to catch the attention of fans. Fox took a risk, tried something new, and won. The pic grossed a stellar $12.6M on Tuesday in its first day of release while playing in 2,660 locations.The new Omen is hoping to attract the teens and young adults that typically power all of today’s horror hits, as well as older fans of the genre who are curious to see this new cover version. Critics have been mixed in their reviews complaining that it is too similar to the original and that there was no need to revisit this story. But money does rule Hollywood and horror films are very profitable so making newer versions of stories that worked in the past is just what studios are lining up to do. The marketing push has been commendable. Had Omen opened on a Friday, it would have been the umpteenth fright flick of the year. Instead, the date spooked people and caught the attention of the media that spread the hype.Because this is a horror audience we are looking at, rapid erosion should follow the mid-week opening diluting down the weekend gross. Omen will burn through much of its audience in its first three days before the Friday-to-Sunday period arrives and it might even scare up more than half of its eventual domestic total in the first week. No other scary films are doing any serious biz so competition should not be much of a factor. Plus Omen is benefiting from Fox playing its trailer in front of the X-Men sequel which was seen by millions of sci-fi and horror fans over the past two weeks. For the three-day weekend period, The Omen might gross roughly $17M and over the six-day Tuesday-to-Sunday span, it could scare up around $36M.In the weekend’s other unusual release pattern, Robert Altman’s latest film A Prairie Home Companion opens nationally on hundreds of screens instead of the typical arthouse platform release that the director’s films usually go out with. The legendary filmmaker’s latest ensemble cast brings together Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline, Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, and teen queen Lindsay Lohan getting herself some indie cred. The PG-13 film about country music stars gathering for one final radio show performance has earned positive reviews and is being released by Picturehouse.Altman films usually debut in New York and Los Angeles, build momentum through critical support, and slowly widen across the country. But Prairie is rocking its way into 725 theaters on opening day aiming to offer older adults a smart alternative to the super heroes and spies of summer. The film is sure to skew older than anything else out now which means it might also have legs if the target audience is pleased. Still, there is only so much of a built-in audience that the pic can tap into and the summer release means there will be no awards season to keep the buzz rolling along like with the helmer’s Gosford Park in early 2002. Prairie might struggle to find a broad audience this weekend given all the other high profile films targeting its audience. Adults may instead choose to take their kids to Cars, catch Jen and Vince in a shouting match, or get a weather forecast from Al Gore. An opening weekend gross of around $3M seems likely.Universal’s The Break-Up spent just four days at the number one spot before being kicked to the curb by The Omen. Romantic comedies usually do not suffer large declines and the Aniston-Vaughn pairing has held up well during the week grossing $3.9M on Monday and $4M on Tuesday when it faced Damien. Also, the new crop of films this weekend should not steal away too much of its crowd of adult women. Still, Break-Up isn’t exactly generating a whole lot of love with audiences in the word-of-mouth department so a 45% drop could result. That would give the film about $22M for the frame and a solid $76M in ten days.X-Men: The Last Stand has its cyclops eye on joining the $200M club this weekend. The Fox sequel suffered a stiff 67% freefall last weekend in its second frame, but should stabilize in its third fight. Wolverine and chums could see sales get sliced in half which would give the super hero pic around $17M for the weekend and a plump $203M in 17 days. That would shoot it past studio stablemate Ice Age: The Meltdown to reign as the top-grossing film of 2006.Over the Hedge should take a bit of a beating this weekend as it no longer will be the only major digital toon in town. A 40% fall would give the Paramount release roughly $12M upping the cume to $132M. Sony could see a larger 45% drop for The Da Vinci Code and finish the frame with about $10M. That would put the total for the Tom Hanks starrer at $189M and counting.LAST YEAR: Before Namibia, fans had to look to their local movie theater to find Brad and Angelina. The much-hyped action film Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith conquered the box office with a strong $50.3M in its debut frame. The Fox blockbuster enjoyed sturdy legs grossing $186.3M domestically and over $465M worldwide. A pair of former number ones followed with Madagascar taking second with $17.2M and Star Wars Episode III in third with $14.9M. Adam Sandler finished fourth with The Longest Yard which scored $13.9M. Opening in fifth place was the kid adventure The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl with $12.6M on its way to $39.2M for Miramax. Disappointing in their openings were the Paramount comedy remake The Honeymooners with $5.5M and the Lions Gate horror flick High Tension with $1.9M. Final grosses reached $12.8M and $3.7M, respectively.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Dead, crime, drama, WGN, ghosts, Moore, mockumentary, Rom-Com, Hulu, Carpet, chucky, of, romantic, Oscars, kong","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Cars-Battles-Omen-at-Theaters"},{"id":"47509167152295","title":"Ip Man Star Donnie Yen Joins John Wick: Chapter 4, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ip Man Star Donnie Yen Joins John Wick: Chapter 4, and More Movie NewsIssa Rae enters the Spider-Verse, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II teams up with Dwayne Johnson, and Damien Chazelle and David O. Russell both recruit big names.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 4, 2021 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Creed III, Firestarter, and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2.This WEEK’S TOP STORYIP MAN’S&nbsp;DONNIE YEN JOINS&nbsp;JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4(Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/Getty Images)John Wick (Certified Fresh at 86%) could have “just” been a very well-produced action revenge thriller, but the film’s star Keanu Reeves, director Chad Stahelski, and screenwriter Derek Kolstad figured out a winning formula has has led to sequels and even a spinoff series focused on its secret world of assassins. Production on&nbsp;John Wick: Chapter 4 has been held back a little bit by both the COVID-19 pandemic (and scheduling conflicts with Reeves’ other upcoming #4 sequel,&nbsp;The Matrix 4, scheduled for 12/22/2021), but the pieces are finally coming together for filming to happen at locations in France, Germany, and Japan this summer. Just last week, we learned that pop star Rina Sawayama will make her acting debut in a lead role in John Wick: Chapter 4, and now we know about another big addition to the cast. Hong Kong superstar Donnie Yen has recently increased his Hollywood profile with roles in films like Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (Certified Fresh at 84%) and Disney’s live-action Mulan (Certified Fresh at 72%), and next,&nbsp;he will co-star in John Wick: Chapter 4&nbsp; as an old friend of Wick’s who shares many of his experiences… and enemies. John Wick: Chapter 4&nbsp;is currently scheduled for May 27, 2022. Finally, in what is probably a coincidence, both Donnie Yen&nbsp;and Keanu Reeves have been rumored in recent years to be&nbsp;in consideration for the role of&nbsp;Marvel’s Namor the Sub-Mariner, with Yen even Tweeting this audition picture. Marvel Studios has made no official Namor announcements.Other Top Headlines1. ISSA RAE JOINS INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE SEQUEL AS SPIDER-WOMAN(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Some weeks reveal&nbsp;certain trends&nbsp;in development news, and this week, the theme involves stars on the upswing landing big new projects with the potential of expanding their careers. Let’s start with Issa Rae, whose&nbsp;popular YouTube series&nbsp;Awkward Black Girl&nbsp;led to the acclaimed HBO series Insecure (Fresh at 96%), which likewise led to a supporting role in The Hate U Give (Certified Fresh at 97%) and lead roles in The Photograph&nbsp;(Fresh at 74%), and The Lovebirds (Fresh at 65%). Issa Rae will also provide the voice of Jessica Drew, AKA Spider-Woman, in the upcoming sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 97%) as the sequel’s first new cast member. It is not yet known if Rae might also be in the running to play the role also suspected to be Jessica Drew in the untitled female-centric Spider-Man spinoff that director Olivia Wilde is currently developing (though it’s also worth noting that there have been a few different Marvel heroes all called Spider-Woman). The Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse sequel is currently scheduled for release on October 7, 2022. Although Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld are both confirmed to be returning, other stars like Nicolas Cage (as Spider-Man Noir) and John Mulaney (as Peter Porker/Spider-Ham) haven’t yet been announced.2. DWAYNE JOHNSON AND&nbsp;YAHYA ABDUL-MATEEN II&nbsp;TEAM UP FOR EMERGENCY CONTACT(Photo by Priscilla Grant, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is not yet a “household name,” but his face is becoming more and more familiar following breakout roles in two DC Comics projects, first as the villain Black Manta in Aquaman (Fresh at 65%), and then as nope-we’re-not-spoiling-it in HBO’s Watchmen (Fresh at 96%). Roles in US and The Trial of the Chicago 7 will also soon be followed by performances in the Candyman reboot (8/27/2021), The Matrix 4 (12/22/2021), and Aquaman 2 (12/16/2022) (for which&nbsp;he&nbsp;is currently preparing). Abdul-Mateen II and Dwayne Johnson are teaming up to produce an action movie set in Austin, Texas for Warner Bros. called Emergency Contact, in which Abdul-Mateen II will also star (it’s not yet known if Johnson will have a supporting role, but it sounds like he’s not the film’s star). The premise of Emergency Contact is being kept secret for now, except that it’s a “high-concept, high-octane action film set in Austin,” and that the screenwriters also worked with Dwayne Johnson on his upcoming DC Comics movie Black Adam (7/29/2022).3.&nbsp;SAMARA WEAVING LEADS NEW ADDITIONS TO CAST OF DAMIEN CHAZELLE’S&nbsp;BABYLON(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Damien Chazelle, who won an Academy Award for directing&nbsp;La La Land&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 91%), and who also directed&nbsp;Whiplash&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 94%) and&nbsp;First Man&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 87%), has been trying to get his movie&nbsp;Babylon&nbsp;about Hollywood in the 1920s going for a few years now (much of that delay was caused by COVID-19, obviously).&nbsp;Babylon&nbsp;is going to feature a large ensemble cast led by Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie,&nbsp;which will now also include&nbsp;Samara Weaving (Ready or Not), Max Mingella (The Social Network), Lukas Haas (Witness), Eric Roberts (The Pope of Greenwich Village), and rocker-turned-actor Flea of the band Red Hot Chili Peppers. Katherine Waterston, who co-starred with Joaquin Phoenix in&nbsp;Inherent Vice, also joined&nbsp;Babylon&nbsp;in a separate announcement. Paramount Pictures has scheduled&nbsp;Babylon&nbsp;for a limited release on December 25, 2022 which will then platform to a wide release on January 6, 2023.4. ROBERT DE NIRO, ANYA TAYLOR-JOY, CHRIS ROCK, AND TAYLOR SWIFT AMONG NEW ADDITIONS TO DAVID O. RUSSELL’S LATEST ENSEMBLE(Photo by JA/Everett Collection)Another director who is assembling an ambitious ensemble for his next project is David O. Russell, whose last film six years ago was the 2015 “Miracle Mop” movie Joy, starring Jennifer Lawrence. We’ve known for a while now that the leads in his next film will be Christian Bale and Margot Robbie, supported by John David Washington, Rami Malek, and Zoe Saldana. This week, however, the cast list sort of ballooned to include Robert De Niro, Mike Myers, Alessandro Nivola, Timothy Olyphant, Andrea Riseborough, Chris Rock, Matthias Schoenaerts, Michael Shannon, Anya Taylor-Joy, and pop singer Taylor Swift, in a relatively rare acting performance (Swift’s first since Cats). Both the premise and the title of this film are currently being kept secret by 20th Century Studios. Having said that, past reports have described the lead characters as being “a doctor and a lawyer who form an unlikely partnership.”5.&nbsp;JONATHAN MAJORS TO PLAY ADONIS’ NEXT OPPONENT IN&nbsp;CREED III(Photo by The Washington Post/Getty Images)Even lifelong Rocky fans probably have to admit that the franchise was seriously struggling before it was revived in 2015 with the spinoff Creed (Certified Fresh at 95%), which turned the focus towards Adonis Creed, the son of Rocky’s friend Apollo, as played by Michael B. Jordan. That film was followed by Creed II (Certified Fresh at 83%), in which Creed squared off against another son of a famous boxer, Ivan Drago, who killed Apollo in Rocky IV (Rotten at 40%). We don’t yet know the premise for Creed III (with which Michael B. Jordan will make his feature film directorial debut), but we do now know that Adonis’ new boxing opponent will be played by Jonathan Majors of HBO’s Lovecraft Country. As expected, fans were quick to speculate about who Majors might play, with the most common guess being the son (or some other relative) of Clubber Lang, who was played in Rocky III (Fresh at 63%)&nbsp;by Mr. T, whose last major role was over 10 years ago in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (Certified Fresh at 86%). It is not yet known how the recent acquisition of MGM by Amazon might impact the theatrical release of Creed III.6.&nbsp;TIFFANY HADDISH TO PORTRAY FLORENCE GRIFFITH JOYNER IN NEW BIOPIC(Photo by Michele K. Short/Universal Pictures)The recent career of Tiffany Haddish has been so prolific and ubiquitous that it might be easy to forget that her breakout role in Girls Trip (Certified Fresh at 91%)&nbsp;came just four years ago in 2017. Haddish hasn’t had that much time to expand into other genres besides comedy,&nbsp;but she&nbsp;is indeed taking her shot at an ambitious dramatic role that will also require (ostensibly) a good amount of physical personal training, as&nbsp;she is producing and will star in a biopic about the life of three-time Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith Joyner, popularly known as “Flo-Jo.” Florence Griffith Joyner (who died in 1998) was an American track and field athlete who in 1988 set still-standing world records in both the 100 meter and 200 meter dash, and then retired less than a year later. Tiffany Haddish will also be producing a documentary series about “Flo-Jo” as a companion to the narrative&nbsp;feature.7.&nbsp;GLENN CLOSE JOINS&nbsp;TWINS-STYLE COMEDY&nbsp;BROTHERS(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics)A little over a year ago, The Weekly Ketchup reported Avengers: Infinity War co-stars Josh Brolin and Peter Dinklage were signed to co-star in a Twins-style comedy called Brothers for director Macon Blair (I Don’t Feel At Home in This World Anymore, Certified Fresh at 89%). Before we get to this week’s actual news, this is a good place to&nbsp;remind everyone that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is now so big that its list of illustrious alumni is massive. That being said, yes, Brothers is going to feature another MCU star, and that will be Glenn Close, who appeared in Guardians of the Galaxy (Certified Fresh at 92%) as the leader of the Nova Corps. Close’s role in Brothers isn’t yet known, but an obvious guess is that she could be playing the mother of the two siblings played by Brolin and Dinklage. (Collider also pointed out that Glenn Close did play the mother of Ed Helms and Owen Wilson in the similarly-titled Father Figures in 2017.)8.&nbsp;IT: CHAPTER TWO ALUM JOINS&nbsp;REBOOT OF STEPHEN KING ADAPTATION&nbsp;FIRESTARTER(Photo by Michael Tran/Getty Images)One of the more memorable “kills” in IT: Chapter Two (Fresh at 62%) is the moment when a young girl is pulled under the bleachers by Pennywise the evil clown. That girl was played by 8-year-old Ryan Kiera Armstrong, who is now 11, and she has been cast as the lead in another Stephen King adaptation, the reboot of Firestarter, which was first adapted as a 1984 movie (Rotten at 37%) starring Drew Barrymore. The announcement of Armstrong’s casting came along with a set photo of Armstrong in character, wearing a jacket that looks like it might have been in or around, you know, a fire. Armstrong joins a cast that includes the already announced Zac Efron as her father (originally played by David Keith) and Michael Greyeyes as the Native American government agent assigned to befriend her (controversially played by George C. Scott in the original film). Former ER star Gloria Reuben also landed a Firestarter role this week.9.&nbsp;ALICIA SILVERSTONE RETURNS TO HIGH SCHOOL IN REBEL WILSON COMEDY&nbsp;SCHOOL YEAR(Photo by ©Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)It has been over 25 years since the now-classic teen comedy Clueless (Certified Fresh at 81%), and the career of its star Alicia Silverstone has taken her a lot of places, including Gotham City as Batgirl (Batman &amp; Robin, Rotten at 12%). Silverstone, now 44, is signed to return to high school (sort of) in the Paramount Players high school comedy Senior Year. Rebel Wilson will star in Senior Year as a cheerleader who wakes up from a coma after 20 years to return to her high school “to regain her status and claim the prom queen crown that eluded her.”On an Apple device?

For example, the reasons former Human Torch actors Chris Evans and Michael B. Jordan were both able to star as Captain America and Killmonger in Black Panther, respectively, is that their Fantastic Four movies were under 20th Century Fox, not Marvel Studios itself. Marvel played around with this concept a little bit in WandaVision (Fresh at 91%), in which Wanda’s brother Pietro (AKA Quicksilver) was “recast” as Evan Peters, who first played Quicksilver in X-Men: Days of Future Past (Certified Fresh at 90%) (again, a Fox film and not Marvel Studios itself). It was a cheeky switcheroo to pull, since the MCU’s Quicksilver was played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson in Avengers: Age of Ultron.&nbsp;With that in mind, Taylor-Johnson signed on this week to star in another Marvel movie,&nbsp;namely&nbsp;Kraven the Hunter, a solo movie about one of Spider-Man’s oldest villains (August, 1964 to be precise), which Sony Pictures has scheduled for release on January 13, 2023. J.C. Chandor (All is Lost, Triple Frontier, A Most Violent Year) will direct the Kraven the Hunter movie, which is expected to be a standalone very much in the style of Venom (Rotten at 29%) and the upcoming Morbius (1/28/2022).Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;TODD PHILLIPS OFFICIALLY WORKING ON SCREENPLAY TO&nbsp;JOKER SEQUEL(Photo by Niko Tavernise/©Warner Bros.)The DC Comics origin story Joker (Fresh at 68%) might have led to a satisfying conclusion, but the film also left a lot of the villain’s story yet to be told. Warner Bros. moved quickly into development on a Joker sequel in late 2019, but the year-that-was-2020 may have slowed down how the sequel may have otherwise developed. This week, in a profile of various Hollywood lawyers, The Hollywood Reporter may have buried the lede, which is that Joker director and co-writer Todd Phillips is now officially signed to co-write&nbsp;the Joker sequel. That doesn’t give us much more to work with, such as whether Phillips will return to direct or Joaquin Phoenix will return to star, but both are probably more likely than not. Warner Bros. has not currently scheduled the Joker sequel for release (but we can guess that it won’t be before 2023 because WB/DC’s 2022 slate is already packed).2. TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET IS YOUR NEW WONKA(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)Some classic characters are portrayed just once and seem to transcend generations (Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird), while others seem to be reimagined occasionally for new generations. Gene Wilder starred in the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (Certified Fresh at 90%), but then Johnny Depp took over the character in the 2005 remake Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Certified Fresh at 83%), and both movies have their fans. Warner Bros. and director Paul King (Paddington, Paddington 2) have been developing a prequel called Wonka for a while now, with the most recent news before this week being in January, when it was revealed that Warner Bros. was considering either Tom Holland (Marvel’s Spider-Man) or their own Dune reboot star, Timothée Chalamet. Well, it’s finally official: Timothée Chalamet will star in the prequel Wonka, which will reportedly feature several musical numbers that will require Chalamet to sing and dance on screen following several months of practice and preparation. Warner Bros. has scheduled Wonka for release on March 17, 2023. In the meantime, Chalamet is now filming another movie with his Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino. The film is called Bones &amp; All, and it’s a horror film adapted from the 2015 novel by author Camille DeAngelis.3. HENRY CAVILL TO PROVE THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONE HIGHLANDER(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Henry Cavill is well on his way to being one of Hollywood’s modern stars with&nbsp;several franchises on his resume. In addition to his movies as Superman, Cavill has also co-starred in Mission: Impossible – Fallout, tried his hand at The Man from U.N.C.L.E., starred as Sherlock Holmes on Netflix (Enola Holmes), co-starred in new adaptations of The Count of Monte Cristo, Red Riding Hood, and Tristan &amp; Isolde, and is currently starring in Netflix’s video game adaptation series The Witcher. We can now add another fantasy franchise to Cavill’s filmography, as he is signed to&nbsp;take on the lead role&nbsp;in the Highlander reboot to be directed by Chad Stahelski (of John Wick and its sequels). The premise of the Highlander reboot isn’t yet known, including whether Cavill will be playing one of the characters from the original or a completely new one.4. POP STAR RINA SAWAYAMA TO MAKE ACTING DEBUT IN JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4(Photo by David M. Benett/Getty Images)Like many things, filming of Keanu Reeves’ John Wick: Chapter 4&nbsp;was delayed by COVID-19 from its original start date in 2020 to later this year, aiming for a release date of May 27, 2022. As is common with all of the John Wick movies, the details are being kept secret, but we now know Reeves will be joined by Japanese-British pop singer Riwa Sawayama in her feature film acting debut. Filming of John Wick: Chapter 4 is expected to take place in France, Germany, and Japan this summer, after which Sawayama will be starting a world tour. John Wick: Chapter 4 will be directed by Chad Stahelski, who is also developing the aforementioned Highlander reboot.5. EVIL DEAD RISE FRANCHISE REBOOT (AGAIN) COMING TO HBO MAX(Photo by ©New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)The Evil Dead horror franchise is currently getting a little tricky to track. Bruce Campbell starred in the first three Evil Dead films, which included Army of Darkness (despite it not having Evil Dead in the title). Then, there was a fourth Evil Dead (Fresh at 63%) in 2013 that was basically a reboot, and that was followed by a Starz television series called Ash vs Evil Dead, which served as a sequel to the original films. Now, New Line Cinema is moving forward with plans for Evil Dead Rise, which some sites are calling Evil Dead 4, which presumably refers to it continuing the story from the first three (despite really being the 5th). Bruce Campbell will not return to star as Ash Williams in Evil Dead Rise (but he will executive produce along with Sam Raimi), as the leads will now be two twin sisters played by Alyssa Sutherland (Vikings) and Lily Sullivan (TV’s Picnic at Hanging Rock), and the setting will also be “the city” versus the “cabin in the woods” of the previous movies.6. JAMES BOND PRODUCERS ASSURE NO TIME TO DIE WILL DEBUT IN THEATERS(Photo by ©MGM)Less than a week after the news first broke that Amazon had bid to buy MGM, the deal was confirmed with a $8.45 billion price tag. The logic behind the deal seems to be that it will greatly bolster the content available&nbsp;on the Amazon Prime subscription service, but the immediate results are sometimes more complex than that. For example, MGM actually sold the rights to most of its pre-1986 catalog to Turner and Warner Bros. in the 1980s (so this deal doesn’t include The Wizard of Oz or Gone with the Wind). Some people also wondered if this meant the long-delayed-by-COVID-19 James Bond film No Time to Die (10/7/2021) might debut on Amazon instead of theaters. James Bond franchise producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson were quick to correct this speculation, saying, “We are committed to continuing to make James Bond films for the worldwide theatrical audience.” (Of course, this doesn’t necessarily mean&nbsp;anything for&nbsp;future Bond films.)7. GODZILLA VS KONG DIRECTOR ADAPTING COMIC BY THE WALKING DEAD CREATOR(Photo by Jason Mendez/Everett Collection)The monster movie Godzilla Vs Kong (Certified Fresh at 75%) was both a critical and box office success (relative to when it was released in the COVID-19 pandemic, obviously). Director Adam Wingard has been quite busy lining up future projects, which currently include a Face/Off sequel and the long-awaited ThunderCats movie, but Wingard is now also now signed with Universal Pictures to at least co-write an adaptation of the comic book series Hardcore by Robert Kirkman of The Walking Dead and Invincible fame. Hardcore is set in a world where ordinary people’s bodies can be taken over by “The Hardcore Program” to act as living human drones by soldiers who can’t otherwise get access to their targets any other way. This Hardcore should also not be confused with 2015’s Hardcore Henry (Rotten at 52%), which was released in the USA under the same Hardcore title.8. EVERY BOXER GETS HIS DAY: GEORGE FOREMAN BIOPIC TRAINING UP(Photo by ©Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)Pretty much every major sport has had at least a few biopics over the years, but arguably, few sports are as well represented&nbsp;as boxing. Even with that being the case, there still remain many famous boxers who haven’t had their own biopics yet, and few of those exceptions are as famous as George Foreman, who notably followed up his career as a two-time Heavyweight Champion with a lucrative second career as an entrepreneur with his trademark George Foreman Grill. Sony Pictures is moving forward with plans for an untitled George Foreman biopic, with Khris Davis now signed to star as Foreman and Sullivan Jones cast as his rival Muhammad Ali. Davis recently co-starred in Judas and the Black Messiah, and his credits also include TV’s The Blacklist and Atlanta. This biopic from director George Tillman Jr. (The Hate U Give, The Longest Ride) will focus on both Foreman’s early career success and his comeback at the age of 45.9. JOHNNY KNOXVILLE CONFIRMS HE’S DONE BEING A JACKASS(Photo by ©Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)Time, as it’s said, waits for no man, and Jackass stars are no exception. Johnny Knoxville has been starring in various Jackass projects since the original series first debuted on MTV over 20 years ago in 2000, but&nbsp;he also turned 50 this past March. While talking about his latest injuries filming Jackass 4 (10/22/2021), Knoxville revealed that it will also be his final Jackass project, saying, “You can only take so many chances before something irreversible happens… I feel like I’ve been extremely lucky to take the chances I’ve taken and still be walking around.” Of course, we may still see another Jackass movie someday, as a new generation of pranksters could ostensibly take over the franchise in the future.On an Apple device?

For the two upcoming sequels, Johnson, producer Ram Bergman, and star Daniel Craig made a deal with Netflix that will land each of them a record-breaking $100 million. This week, Johnson proceeded to cast up Knives Out 2 with the first four stars to join Daniel Craig, and three of them are Marvel Studios alumni. The fun started on Monday when, Dave Bautista (Drax from Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy) became the first&nbsp;new cast member announced, in what is basically a Spectre (Fresh at 63%) reunion, since Bautista and Craig faced off against each other in that James Bond film. The next day, Bautista and Craig were joined by&nbsp;Edward Norton, who was Marvel Studios’ The Incredible Hulk (Fresh at 67%) (before Mark Ruffalo took over the role). Wednesday marked the third day in a row with a Knives Out 2 casting announcement, namely Janelle Monáe (Antebellum), who is the only non-Marvel alumni in this batch. Finally, on Thursday, the sequel’s fifth cast member was announced as Kathryn Hahn,&nbsp;who is coming off a great role in the Disney+ series WandaVision (Fresh at 92%). We don’t know the name of Hahn’s character yet, but it would really be something if turns out to be “Kathryn Hahn All Along.” Production of Knives Out 2&nbsp;is scheduled to start in Greece later this summer, 2021.Other Top Headlines1. REGINA KING TO DIRECT MONSTER COMIC BOOK MOVIE BITTER ROOT(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Academy Award winning actress Regina King (If Beale Street Could Talk, HBO’s Watchmen) recently made her directorial debut with the historical drama One Night in Miami (Certified Fresh at 98%), and this week, she signed on for another period piece, although the similarities largely end there. King will direct&nbsp;the comic book adaptation Bitter Root, based on the Image Comics title&nbsp;about a monster-hunting family who take on an invasion of supernatural forces during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. King will also be one of the producers of Bitter Root, along with her sister Reina and Ryan Coogler (Black Panther) and his Proximity Media company. The other part of the production deal is Legendary Entertainment, which recently gave us Godzilla vs Kong&nbsp;and produced the DC Comics movies 300, 300: Rise of an Empire, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Man of Steel, and Watchmen. On the acting front, Regina King also recently signed on to star in one of the three planned Shirley Chisholm biopics.2. PARASITE DIRECTOR BONG JOO-HO PLANNING ANIMATED UNDERWATER HORROR FILM(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)South Korean director Bong Joon-Ho was the big winner at last year’s Academy Awards, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film for Parasite (Certified Fresh at 98%). We usually see big deals being made for Academy Award winners of that stripe, but Bong’s victory lap in 2020 might have been slowed down significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic, which began spreading more widely right around that time last year. So this week’s news might be coming a year later than it otherwise should have, but we can now report that Bong Joon-Ho is planning an animated action/horror film about deep sea creatures. This project isn’t expected to be Bong’s next film as director (probably due to the extended production times of animated features),&nbsp;which will instead be an English-language drama based on “an undisclosed true event from 2016.” As if those two projects won’t keep Bong Joon-Ho busy enough, he is also producing an upcoming Parasite series for HBO Max.3. IDRIS ELBA TO STAY FROSTY IN EXTRACTION DIRECTOR’S CHRISTMAS ACTION MOVIE(Photo by Michael Gibson/STX Entertainment)There was a time (basically the 20th century) when “spec script sales” were frequent and lucrative, but they have decreased in relevance in recent years, possibly because of the increase in license deals, remakes, and comic book adaptations. Spec script deals do, however, still happen occasionally, and this week screenwriter Tyler Marcesa sold his screenplay Stay Frosty to Warner Bros. in a deal worth more than a million dollars. This wasn’t Marcesa’s first screenplay sale, but thus far, none of his projects have been produced yet. Idris Elba is attached to star in the action movie Stay Frosty as a man who survives getting shot in the head and who then has to figure out why an assassin tried to kill him, all the while also trying to get home to his son for Christmas. So, it’s a John Wick-style action movie that also has Christmas-movie elements, a la Die Hard. Stay Frosty will be directed by Sam Hargrave, a former Marvel Studios stunt coordinator who made his directorial feature film debut last year with Extraction (Fresh at 67%).4. BLACK PANTHER AND LOGAN CO-STARS JOIN INDIANA JONES 5(Photo by Derek Storm/Everett Collection, FOX via Getty Images)As of this summer, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;13 years since the 2008 release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Certified Fresh at 78%), but Lucasfilm is finally preparing to film another installment we’re currently calling Indiana Jones 5. The star will obviously be Harrison Ford (who will turn 80 sixteen days before Indiana Jones 5&nbsp;is scheduled to come out on July 29, 2022), and we’ve also recently heard about the casting of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, and Thomas Kretchmann. This week, director James Mangold (3:10 to Yuma, Ford v Ferrari) cast two more for Indiana Jones 5, including the actor who played the villain&nbsp;Donald Pierce in his Wolverine movie Logan (Certified Fresh at 93%), Boyd Holbrook.&nbsp;The other new cast member is Shaunette Renée Wilson, who played one of the Dora Milaje warriors in Black Panther. We don’t know anything about the characters Holbrook or Wilson will be playing, partly because we also don’t know anything about the premise, like, at all, at this point.5. 21 JUMP STREET DIRECTORS TO DEPICT THE EARLY STAGES OF COVID-19 IN THE PREMONITION(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)The directing team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller are probably best known for their various animated projects they directed (Cloudy with the Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie) or produced (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, The Mitchells vs The Machines), but they also directed two live-action films with 21 Jump Street and its sequel 22 Jump Street. What all of those movies have in common is that they’re pretty “light” in tone, but this week, Lord and Miller are branching into more serious material&nbsp;with The Premonition, based on the recent book by journalist Michael Lewis. The Premonition tells the true story of the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and the experts who attempted to warn the world. The film is expected to focus on three characters: a biochemist, a public health worker, and a White House government worker. It’s not yet known if some of the more famous figures working in the White House in 2019 and 2020 will also have roles in The Premonition, the tone of which is being compared to All the President’s Men (Certified Fresh at 94%). In related news, Scream screenwriter Kevin Williamson is also developing an untitled thriller set during the COVID-19 pandemic.6. EUGENIO DERBEZ’ REMAKE OF FRENCH HIT THE VALET TO START FILMING SOON(Photo by ©Sony Pictures Classics courtesy Everett Collection)Hollywood remakes of foreign-language hits are nothing new, and this week we got news of another. In this case, the original film is the French comedy hit The Valet (La Doublure, Fresh at 70%),&nbsp; about a wealthy executive who hires a parking valet to pose as his mistress’s lover in order to prevent his wife from finding out about his affair. Eugenio Derbez (Overboard,&nbsp;Instructions Not Included) is already set to star in the remake as the valet, who, in a slight variation on the original, is hired by a movie star played by Samara Weaving&nbsp;(Ready or Not) to pose as her lover to cover up her relationship with a married man. The cast was filled out this week by Max Greenfield (TV’s The Neighborhood, New Girl), Betsy Brandt (Breaking Bad), Marisol Nichols (Riverdale,&nbsp;Spiral), and Mexican star Carmen Salinas. This remake of The Valet will be directed by Richard Wong (Come As You Are, Certified Fresh at 95%), and the original was directed by Francis Veber, whose French films have frequently been remade in English, including The Birdcage, The Toy, and&nbsp;Dinner for Schmucks.7. DAVID TENNANT AND EMILIA CLARKE TO VOICE ANIMATED DISCWORLD MOVIE &nbsp;(Photo by Abel Fermin, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Discworld is a popular series of over 40 fantasy novels by author Terry Pratchett, but so far, it has eluded adaptation. That may soon change, as the 28th book in the series, The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents, is about to be adapted as an animated film&nbsp;titled simply&nbsp;The Amazing Maurice. David Tennant (Doctor Who), who also starred in the Terry Pratchett series Good Omens, will voice the title character, and other roles will be voiced by Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones), Hugh Laurie (TV’s House), Rob Brydon (The Trip), Gemma Arterton, Hugh Bonneville, Himesh Patel, and David Thewlis. The Amazing Maurice tells the story of a cat and his gang of talking rats who develop a scheme to fool humans and take their money. It’s currently planned for release in the U.K. in 2022, but an American release is still also possible (if any U.S. distributor steps up to make such a deal).8. RUSSELL CROWE TO SHOW OFF HIS POKER FACE… PLAYING POKER(Photo by ©Universal Pictures)The theatrical box office charts were obviously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic this past year, but there were still movies that&nbsp;saw release, such as the Russell Crowe drama Unhinged (Rotten at 48%). Released in August, Unhinged debuted at #2, ascended to #1, and spent over 10 weeks in the top five. Again, the success of Unhinged was aided by diminished competition, but it also shows that despite a deadly virus, there were millions of people who wanted to see a Russell Crowe movie in theaters, so by that standard, he is definitely still a movie star. Crowe recently wrapped filming of Thor: Love and Thunder (5/6/2022), and this week, he signed on to star in a gambling drama called Poker Face, which is about exactly what it sounds like. Crowe will play a tech billionaire who brings his childhood friends together at his Miami estate for some high stakes poker. Poker Face will be directed by Gary Fleder&nbsp;(Runaway Jury, Homefront, Kiss the Girls).9. CONTROVERSIAL 1980s “VIDEO NASTY” FACES OF DEATH TO BE REBOOTED &nbsp;&nbsp;(Photo by Aquarius Releasing)The Internet has been an active element in how fans track movies for over 20 years now, so it’s easy to forget that there was a time when fans were basically challenged to believe whatever they were told by a filmmaker. In the early 1980s, as the home video market was taking off, many horror fans discovered a title called Faces of Death (and its sequels), which purported to depict actual footage of various gruesome deaths (most of which were actually faked, although some weren’t). Faces of Death seems, in that way, such an artifact of its own era, that it would resist any attempt at a reboot or a remake, but that is apparently exactly what is now planned by Legendary Entertainment (Godzilla vs Kong, The Dark Knight). What is being described as a “21st century makeover” of Faces of Death is being developed by filmmakers Isa Mazzei and Danield Goldhaber, the team behind 2018’s Cam (Certified Fresh at 98%). Rather than a “documentary”-style format, the new Faces of Death will reportedly revolve around “a female moderator of a YouTube-like website whose job is to weed out offensive and violent content and who herself is recovering from a serious trauma, who stumbles across a group that is re-creating the murders from the original film.” The producers behind this Faces of Death reboot are also developing the Buck Rogers reboot.10. ENOLA HOLMES 2&nbsp;IS OFFICIALLY IN THE WORKS(Photo by Legendary)Details are a mystery, appropriately enough, but Netflix has offered a very&nbsp;pretty Twitter tease&nbsp;about a follow-up to&nbsp;Enola Holmes, the 2020 movie that stars Millie Bobby Brown as the equally curious sister of Sherlock Holmes. The film, which was originally planned as a theatrical release, moved to Netflix when the streaming service picked up the distribution rights last year during the pandemic.&nbsp;Enola Holmes 2&nbsp;will start out as a Netflix jam, with&nbsp;Stranger Things&nbsp;star Brown returning for the sequel, along with Henry Cavill, director Harry Bradbeer, and screenwriter Jack Thorne. Netflix is offering up no&nbsp;other facts, but since more than 75 million households watched the first movie when it premiered last September, that surely won’t deter fans from trying to scope them out. A good place to start:&nbsp;The Enola Holmes Mysteries, author Nancy Springer’s book series on which the movies are based.On an Apple device?

Oh, and some other stuff too.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 29, 2021 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;such titles as Borderlands and Spy Kids, as well as a few reunion projects.This WEEK’S TOP STORYKEVIN HART JOINS CATE BLANCHETT IN THE&nbsp;BORDERLANDS VIDEO GAME ADAPTATION(Photo by ©Warner Bros. Pictures)If one wanted to find a common theme for Kevin Hart’s movie career, he has twice now proven himself adept at finding a straight man to be his big screen partner, first with Ice Cube (Ride Along, Ride Along 2) and then Dwayne Johnson in the recent Jumanji movies. In a move that pretty much no one saw coming, it now looks like Kevin Hart’s next movie partner might be… Cate Blanchett.&nbsp;Inasmuch as that pairing might be “against type,” the whole movie might be playing into that theme, because what we’re talking about&nbsp;is the video game adaptation Borderlands. Blanchett is attached to star as Lilith, “The Siren,” and Kevin Hart’s character will be Roland, “The Soldier.” Roland and Lilith frequently partner together in the various Borderlands narratives, but they also have a few other crew members yet to be cast. Borderlands will be directed by Eli Roth, who is best known for his work in horror like Cabin Fever and Hostel, but he’s also branched into other genres like he did with the kids movie The House with a Clock in its Walls (also starring Blanchett). Borderlands, its prequel, and sequels have earned over $1 billion in game sales.Other Top Headlines1. DARREN ARONOFSKY TO SET JARED LETO&nbsp;ADRIFT(Photo by Derek Storm/Everett Collection)It doesn’t happen that often, but every once in a while, we will hear about a new movie project with a certain title even though there was just another movie with the exact same title not that long ago. Shailene Woodley’s survival drama Adrift (Fresh at 69%) just came out three years ago, but yes, we’re already getting another Adrift. Jared Leto is now attached to star in a thriller called Adrift which will reunite him with Darren Aronofsky, his director on the addiction thriller Requiem for a Dream ( Certified Fresh at 79%). Adrift is described as being a thriller about a “ghost ship” based on a short story by Koji Suzuki, who also wrote the inspiration for Ringu (The Ring) (Fresh at 97%). It’s important to note, however, that this will not be Aronofsky’s next film, as that’s already confirmed to be the recently announced overeating drama The Whale, starring Brendan Fraser.2. MICHELLE WILLIAMS TO REUNITE WITH KELLY REICHARDT FOR FOURTH FILM TOGETHER(Photo by Jim Spellman/Getty Images)If there is just one director that is most closely connected to the film career of actress Michelle Williams, it’s probably Kelly Reichardt,&nbsp;who has previously cast Williams in Wendy &amp; Lucy (Certified Fresh at 85%), Meek’s Cutoff (Certified Fresh at 86%), and Certain Women (Certified Fresh at 92%).&nbsp;Williams and Reichardt are now reuniting for an A24 movie called Showing Up, which is a bit of a departure for Reichardt, as it’s described as a “comedy” (Reichardt’s movies… not super funny.) Williams will reportedly star as an artist on the verge of a career-changing exhibition who has to navigate “friends, family and colleagues in the lead-up to her show.” Reichardt’s most recent film was last year’s&nbsp;First Cow&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 96%), which was a festival darling and has earned a handful of honors so far this awards season.3. TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET JOINS LUCA GUADAGNINO’S&nbsp;HORROR ROMANCE&nbsp;BONES &amp; ALL(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)We’ve known almost since Call Me By Your Name came out that director Luca Guadignino is developing a sequel, but recent news concerning Armie Hammer suggests why&nbsp;that movie might be put on hold for a bit. Instead, Guadagnino and his other Call Me By Your Name star, Timothée Chalamet, are now considering reuniting for a completely different movie project. Chalamet is now in talks to star in Guadagnino’s horror romance Bones &amp; All, which has been speculated to involve cannibalism.4. PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN STAR CAREY MULLIGAN SCRATCHES FINGERNAILSRyan FujitaniAlthough COVID-19 has obviously impacted this year’s awards season harshly, it is still technically happening, and one of the top contenders this year is the indie thriller Promising Young Woman (Certified Fresh at 91%), starring Carey Mulligan.&nbsp;While she waits to see how things pan out for her this season, Mulligan has signed to star in a project called Fingernails, which will be the English language debut of Greek filmmaker Christos Nikou (Apples). Another major actress involved with Fingernails is Cate Blanchett, who is serving as one of the film’s producers. Christos Nikou is reportedly still working on the Fingernails screenplay, which will reportedly be about a woman who starts to wonder if her relationship with her longtime partner is “real,” leading her to work “at a mysterious institute designed to incite and test the presence of romantic love in increasingly desperate couples.” That premise sounds a bit like The Lobster, which was also directed by a Greek filmmaker, Yorgos Lanthimos.5. DRACULA SPINOFF LAST VOYAGE OF THE DEMETER FINALLY SETS SAIL(Photo by ©Columbia Pictures)One of the odd quirks movie development is that some films take years and years to get produced, and along the way, some just never happen at all. One project that has taken its time is the horror film Last Voyage of the Demeter, which is based on one small part of Bram Stoker’s original vampire novel&nbsp;Dracula&nbsp;and which has been in development at least as far back as 2010. In Dracula, the “Demeter” was the Russian ship that actually transported Dracula and his coffin from Transylvania to England. Last Voyage of the Demeter looks like it’s finally happening, though, with Corey Hawkins now set to star for director Andre Øvredal (Trollhunter, The Autopsy of Jane Doe, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark). Bram Stoker’s novel leaves the exact circumstances of what happened on the Demeter a mystery, except that when the boat finally landed in England, it was empty. Last Voyage of the Demeter is being produced by Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners, but Spielberg himself is not credited as one of its producers.6. THE CROWN STAR CLAIRE FOY GOES FISHING FOR LOVE IN THE PISCES(Photo by Laurie Sparham/©Bleecker Street Media)“Surprise wins” have become a common theme at recent Academy Awards ceremonies (we’re thinking here of Spotlight, Moonlight, and Parasite), but there is an argument to be made that no recent Best Picture winner was quite as unexpected as Guillermo del Toro’s merman romance The Shape of Water, especially given its monster movie character design and roots in GDT’s love for Creature from the Black Lagoon. Mermaids have a long history of appearing in movies, and Disney itself is currently producing their own live-action remake of The Little Mermaid, but this week, we also learned of a movie that seems more inspired by The Shape of Water. Claire Foy, who may be best known as the first actress to star as Queen Elizabeth II on hit Netflix series&nbsp;The Crown, is now set to star in&nbsp;The Pisces, an adaptation of the Melissa Broder novel about a PhD student who falls in love with a merman. The Pisces will be directed by Gillian Robespierre, who is currently best known for her acclaimed collaborations with&nbsp;Jenny Slate (Obvious Child, Landline), which may offer some insight into the tone of the film.7. ETHAN HAWKE ANSWERS THE BLACK PHONE FOR SCOTT DERRICKSON(Photo by Lev Radin/Everett Collection)Movie stars reuniting with directors was clearly a theme this week. Adding to the list is Ethan Hawke, who has joined the cast of a film called The Black Phone, starring Jeremy Davies&nbsp;(TV’s&nbsp;LOST&nbsp;and&nbsp;Justified) and directed by Scott Derrickson&nbsp;(Marvel’s Doctor Strange), the latter of whom previously worked with Hawke on his directorial debut, the 2012 horror film&nbsp;Sinister.&nbsp;The Black Phone will also be Hawke’s ninth project with producer Jason Blum (of Blumhouse), following movies like The Purge (and, briefly, its TV spinoff) and the upcoming Showtime series The Good Lord Bird. Ethan Hawke will also soon be seen in the Vikings drama The Northman and the Disney+ series Moon Knight, starring Oscar Isaac.8. READY OR NOT STAR SAMARA WEAVING TO PLAY NAPOLEON’S SISTER-IN-LAW LIZ(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)One of the all-time greats in the realm of “Hollywood what-ifs” involves Stanley Kubrick’s attempts&nbsp;to direct a biopic of&nbsp;French conqueror Napoleon Bonaparte, with Jack Nicholson long attached to star. We’re talking here about what would have been a major 1970s epic, which means that was over 40 years ago, and yet here we are, and Hollywood has yet to return to the famous historical figure. Instead, we’re&nbsp;it looks like we’re going to get a biopic about a completely different Bonaparte. Liz will be an indie drama about American socialite Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte, A.K.A. Napoleon Bonaparte’s sister-in-law by way of his younger brother Jerome. Samara Weaving, who is probably best known for her role in the 2019 horror comedy Ready or Not (Certified Fresh at 88%), is now attached to star as the titular character in Liz, which&nbsp;will be directed by Adam Leon, whose previous credits include the indie films Tramps and Gimme the Loot.9.&nbsp;ROBERT RODRIGUEZ WANTS TO REBOOT&nbsp;SPY KIDS(Photo by Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images)Director Robert Rodriguez recently returned to the world of his 2005 movie The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl (Rotten at 19%) for the Netflix sequel We Can Be Heroes (Fresh at 73%). Now that he’s done with that particular revisit,&nbsp;he’s&nbsp;planning something similar for the Spy Kids franchise, as he has optioned the rights to reimagine Spy Kids, which&nbsp;he will both write and direct. The new Spy Kids project is also a collaboration between Spyglass Media Group (which owns the franchise rights) and Skydance Media, a company that has co-produced recent Tom Cruise movies like Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (Rotten at 37%), Mission: Impossible – Fallout (Certified Fresh at 97%), and this year’s Top Gun: Maverick. Since it’s being called a re-imagining, it sounds like we probably shouldn’t expect this Spy Kids&nbsp;to feature any of the previous stars, like Antonio Banderas, Alexa Vega, or Daryl Sabara.On an Apple device?

Russell casts his next film, Brendan Fraser goes to work for Darren Aronofsky, Ben Affleck goes to work for Disney, and John McCain and Alice Guy-Blaché both get biopics.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 15, 2021 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering new films from the Academy Award nominated directors of Black Swan and American Hustle, and more.This WEEK’S TOP STORYCHRIS EVANS TO RETURN TO THE MCU, BUT HOW?(Photo by Jay Maidment/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)When it comes to big-budget superhero movies, press releases will frequently keep some details hidden or vague in the interest of not spoiling the film’s premise or story beats. This week’s big news, however, was possibly a rare example of film speculation run amok.&nbsp;Let’s start with the baseline story, which is that Chris Evans is expected to return for at least one more Marvel Studios film after ostensibly leaving the role of Captain America in Avengers: Endgame (Certified Fresh at 94%). Most sources reporting the announcement filled in the blanks to assume Evans was returning as&nbsp;Steve Rogers, but the original story didn’t actually say that. The other possibility to consider is that Evans could be reprising his role as Fantastic Four member Johnny Storm, A.K.A. The Human Torch, possibly in a small cameo role. Kevin Feige confirmed just a few weeks ago that he is currently casting the Fantastic Four reboot, and we’ve also heard recently about the next Spider-Man movie bringing in actors who played villains in the Spider-Man movies starring Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. So, it seems plausible that alternate realities — or a multiverse — could be at play in the future of the MCU, and Chris Evans could have a cameo as someone other than Captain America (it would also explain why Evans tweeted “News to me” in response to the Captain America speculation). Having said that, if Evans is returning as Captain America, the obvious explanation would involve time travel. We already know from the Loki trailer and the casting of Jonathan Majors as the time-traveling villain Kang in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania that the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe will likely feature be very “wibbly wobbly timey wimey.” We’ll just have to wait and see.Other Top Headlines1. ROBERT DE NIRO, RAMI MALEK, CHRIS ROCK, ZOE SALDANA, ANYA TAYLOR-JOY JOIN BIG ENSEMBLE(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Jason Mendez/Everett Collection)Director David O. Russell doesn’t always work with big ensemble casts filled with famous names, but he definitely has done it a few times (American Hustle and I Heart Huckabees, for example). We still don’t have a title for his next film yet, which has already signed&nbsp;Christian Bale, Margot&nbsp; Robbie, and Tenet star John David Washington. The cast expanded twice this week, starting on Wednesday with the news that Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody) and Zoe Saldana (Marvel’s Gamora) had signed on. The very next day, the cast grew even bigger with the additions of Robert De Niro, Mike Myers, Alessandro Nivola, Timothy Olyphant, Andrea Riseborough, Chris Rock, Matthias Shoenaerts, Michael Shannon, and Anya-Taylor Joy (The Witch, The Queen’s Gambit). The project is currently filming in Los Angeles, but details are being kept vague as to what it’s actually about, except that Christian Bale and Margot Robbie are playing a doctor and a lawyer (not necessarily respectively). Whatever the movie ends up being titled, the end result will be distributed by 20th Century Studios, possibly as a late 2021 “awards season” release.2. DARREN ARONOFSKY CASTS BRENDAN FRASER AS THE WHALE(Photo by ©Lionsgate)After taking a few years following his most recent film, 2017’s mother! (Fresh at 68%), director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Black Swan) appears to be getting closer to filming his next, an adaptation of the 2012 play&nbsp;The Whale&nbsp;by playwright Samuel D. Hunter. For the lead role, Aronofsky has cast Brendan Fraser to play “a six hundred pound recluse&nbsp;hiding away from the world and slowly eating himself to death.” A24 will be distributing The Whale, but the project does not currently have an announced production start date, so we don’t have a firm idea of when it might be released, either.3. BEN AFFLECK JOINS DISNEY TO DIRECT KEEPER OF THE LOST CITIES(Photo by Universal Pictures)Author Shannon Messenger’s 2012 children’s fantasy novel&nbsp;Keeper of the Lost Cities has&nbsp;become a series of nine books (and counting), including&nbsp;a few&nbsp;New York Times bestsellers. Walt Disney Pictures obviously hasn’t gotten out of the live-action fantasy movie business, but aside from something like Artemis Fowl, many of their films in that zone lately have been remakes of their animated classics. In that light, it makes total sense that Disney is moving forward with a Keeper of the Lost Cities movie, but what’s more surprising is that it’s Ben Affleck (Argo, Certified Fresh at 96%) who they’ve hired to direct and co-write the adaptation. Studio-wise, the hiring of Ben Affleck is sort of a “get” for Disney, since he has worked quite a bit for Warner Bros. in recent years, including appearance in a few recent movies (and an upcoming HBO Max mini-series) as Batman.4. THE GOOD WIFE WRITER TAKING ON SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN BIOPIC&nbsp;(Photo by Robert Spencer/Getty Images)This coming August 25th will mark the third anniversary of the death of U.S. Senator John McCain, whose other accomplishments include surviving five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and his two campaigns for president in 2000 and 2008. McCain’s life has been detailed in a number of books, and this week, three of them (The Luckiest Man: Life with John McCain, Faith of My Fathers, and Worth the Fighting For) written by former McCain speechwriter and chief of staff Mark Salter were optioned by Stampede Ventures to be adapted into a bigraphical feature film. Stampede Ventures is also the production company currently developing Frosty the Snowman starring Jason Momoa and the Walter Cronkite drama Newsflash. Salter will also co-write the adaptation with producer Craig Turk (TV’s The Good Wife, F.B.I.), with McCain’s widow Cindy McCain acting as the project’s executive producer. Faith of My Fathers was adapted as a TV movie in 2005 with John McCain portrayed by Shawn Hatosy, and Ed Harris also co-starred as McCain in the HBO film Game Change (Fresh at 67%).5. FIRST FEMALE DIRECTOR ALICE GUY-BLACHÉ GETTING HER OWN BIOPIC(Photo by Everett Collection)We recently started a new year, which also could have offered a good jumping off point for the #52FilmsbyWomen challenge, during which movie fans commit to watching at least one movie from a female director&nbsp;every week for a full year. Although male directors ha obviously dominated the industry for much of the last 120+ years, the very first female film director, Alice Guy-Blaché, made her debut in 1896 with the short film&nbsp;The Fairy of the Cabbages&nbsp;(note: in 1896, all movies were short films). The life of Alice Guy-Blaché is now being developed as a biopic from the same filmmakers who also adapted her life story as the 2018 documentary Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché (Certified Fresh at 95%). At the time a secretary for the Gaumont studio, Guy-Blaché was actually in the room when the Lumiere Brothers held their very first public screening in 1895, and within a year she was making her own movies. This eventually led her to America, where she directed over 1,000 short films during the Silent Film Era, working with stars like Lionel and Ethel Barrymore. Jodie Foster narrated the Be Natural documentary, but it’s not yet known if she will also be involved with the biopic.6. CARDI B TO MAKE HER LEAD ACTING DEBUT WITH ASSISTED LIVING(Photo by Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Getty Images)Rapper and pop star Cardi B has had a lot of success in her musical career, but it has&nbsp;been less than three years&nbsp;since her first studio album came out, and only 16 months since she made her feature film acting debut in Hustlers (Certified Fresh at 87%), starring Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu (admittedly, Cardi B’s screentime in Hustlers is almost blink-and-you’ll-miss-her). With all that in mind, she’s ready to take on a lead role, as she is now signed to star in a Paramount Pictures comedy “in the vein of classic funny films like Tootsie, Sister Act, and Mrs. Doubtfire” called Assisted Living. Cardi B will play a small-time crook on the run from the law who finds refuge disguising herself as an elderly resident at her grandmother’s nursing home. Assisted Living got its start at Paramount as a spec script by TV producer and writer Kay Oyegun (This is Us). Cardi B will also have a supporting role in Fast &amp; Furious 9 (5/28/2021, tentatively).7. ANNA PAQUIN JOINS SHAZAM! STAR IN FOOTBALL BIOPIC AMERICAN UNDERDOG(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)One of the last films to have a wide release in the USA in 2020 before COVID-19 shut down theaters was the faith-based romance I Still Believe (Rotten at 51%), which still managed to earn back its production budget ($16.4 million against $12 million). That film was the first from a new faith-based production company called Kingdom Story Company, and their second and third movies will both feature Shazam! star Zachary Levi. The teen drama Unbreakable Boy is currently filming, and production will soon start on the football biopic American Underdog: The Kurt Warner Story. Zachary Levi will star as Warner, who&nbsp;overcame&nbsp;a series of hurdles (including having the bad luck of trying out for the QB job for the Green Bay Packers early in Brett Favre’s career)&nbsp;to become the only person inducted into both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Arena Football Hall of Fame. The news this week is that True Blood and The Piano star Anna Paquin has also signed on to co-star as Brenda Warner, Kurt Warner’s wife. American Underdog will be directed by Andrew and Jon Erwin (who also directed I Still Believe) and the film will be distributed by Lionsgate.8. MICHAEL PEÑA JOINS ROLAND EMMERICH’S DISASTER MOVIE&nbsp;MOONFALL(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)After trying a few other genres (Anonymous, Stonewall), disaster movie&nbsp;specialist Roland Emmerich has been getting back to his roots more recently (Independence Day: Resurgence and the war movie Midway), and will especially do so with Moonfall, which is about exactly what it sounds like. The Moonfall ensemble cast will include Halle Berry, Charlie Plummer, Donald Sutherland, Patrick Wilson, John Bradley (Samwell Tarley from Game of Thrones), and until this week, Transformers star Stanley Tucci. Tucci had to drop out of the production due to recently imposed travel restrictions preventing him from flying from the U.K. to Canada where the film is being produced. Instead, Ant-Man MVP supporting actor Michael Peña has signed on for Tucci’s role as a “a wealthy car dealer” who is married to the ex-wife of Patrick Wilson’s character. Presumably, some of those used cars are about to get demolished by some big old moon&nbsp;rocks.9. ARMIE HAMMER DROPS OUT OF J.LO ROMCOM SHOTGUN WEDDING(Photo by Daniel Smith/Warner Bros.)Armie Hammer became the focus of an online controversy&nbsp;this week, the nature of which we won’t get into. The news came out just before Hammer was about to spend four months in the Dominican Republic filming the romantic comedy Shotgun Wedding with Jennifer Lopez, but the production will now need to recast the role, as&nbsp;he has dropped out. This will actually be the second time the role will be recast, as it was originally supposed to be played by Ryan Reynolds (who is still executive producing Shotgun Wedding). Lopez and whoever-replaces-Armie-Hammer will star in Shotgun Wedding as a couple having a destination wedding in the Caribbean who then begin to get cold feet, just as everybody in the wedding party also gets taken hostage. Shotgun Wedding will be directed by Jason Moore (Pitch Perfect, Sisters) from a screenplay by Liz Meriwether (No Strings Attached) and Mark Hammer (Two Night Stand), who as far as we can tell, isn’t related to Armie Hammer.On an Apple device?

Abrams hires the first female screenwriter to pen a Star Trek movie, and new roles for Jonathan Majors, Russell Crowe, Annette Bening, and Hugh Grant.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 5, 2021 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;such titles as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Hello Kitty, and Searching 2.This WEEK’S TOP STORYALEJANDRO GONZÁLEZ IÑÁRRITU&nbsp;HAS BEGUN FILMING HIS NEXT PROJECT(Photo by ©Roadside Attractions courtesy Everett Collection)Getting a feature film produced is difficult enough, even without the spectre of the COVID-19 pandemic looming over society for the past&nbsp;year or so. Just over five years ago at the 88th Academy Awards, Alejandro González Iñárritu&nbsp;won the Oscar for Best Director&nbsp;for&nbsp;The Revenant&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 78%), which also won Best Cinematography and Best Actor for Leonardo DiCaprio, and this week, Iñárritu was finally able to&nbsp;start filming his first feature film&nbsp;in the five-plus years since. The project, called&nbsp;Limbo, is now filming on location in Mexico City. Iñárritu also wrote the film, which doesn’t yet have an official synopsis, except that it “explores the political and social modernity of Mexico.” Iñárritu’s choice to film in Mexico City following his Hollywood success with&nbsp;The Revenant&nbsp;could also be compared to Alfonso Cuaron’s&nbsp;Roma&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 95%), which was filmed in Mexico City following his own Hollywood success with&nbsp;Gravity&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 95%). No casting announcements have been made yet for&nbsp;Limbo.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;J.J. ABRAMS HIRES FIRST FEMALE&nbsp;STAR TREK&nbsp;FEATURE SCREENWRITER(Photo by Paramount Pictures)It was&nbsp;just last week&nbsp;that producer J.J. Abrams and his Bad Robot production company hired award-winning writer Ta-Nehisi Coates to work on the new&nbsp;Superman&nbsp;reboot (featuring an actor of color as the lead, for a historic first). This week, Abrams moved forward with another “first” as Bad Robot&nbsp;has hired screenwriter Kalinda Vasquez&nbsp;to work on the next&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;feature film. This project should not be confused with the&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;that Quentin Tarantino was announced as partnering with Abrams and Bad Robot in 2017 (as that one appears to have cooled down in the years since). If Vasquez’s work on this project makes it to production, she will become the first woman ever to write a&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;feature film. In addition to serving as executive producer on shows like&nbsp;Runaways,&nbsp;Star Trek: Discovery,&nbsp;Once Upon a Time, and&nbsp;Fear the Walking Dead, Kalinda Vasquez has also written episodes of all of those shows, plus four episodes of&nbsp;Prison Break&nbsp;and seven episodes of&nbsp;Nikita. It is not yet known if&nbsp;her&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;project will introduce a new cast or use one of the previous casts (like say,&nbsp;the “Kelvin” crew&nbsp;of Chris Pine, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, etc.) Paramount Pictures does not currently have any&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;feature films on the studio’s release schedule.2. ANNETTE BENING TO PORTRAY RECORD-BREAKING SWIMMER DIANA NYAD(Photo by Suzanne Tenner/©Focus Features)Diana Nyad is a record-breaking long distance swimmer&nbsp;whose accomplishments include swimming from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage, swimming from Jamaica to Florida, and swimming around the island of Manhattan in under 8 hours. Nyad’s amazing life is now set to be adapted as the biopic Nyad, with four-time Academy Award nominee Annette Bening&nbsp;attached to star. Nyad will mark the narrative feature film directorial debut of the team of Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, who won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for their 2018 documentary Free Solo (Certified Fresh at 98%), which depicted a similar form of endurance sport (free solo mountain climbing). Nyad is being adapted from her autobiography Find a Way, with filming expected to start sometime this summer.3. RUSSELL CROWE TO STAR AS ABSTRACT ARTIST MARK ROTHKO(Photo by © Universal Pictures)There have obviously been dozens of biopics about famous painters, but so far, we have relatively few to date about abstract painters (Pollock, Certified Fresh at 80% starring Ed Harris, is a notable exception). That “field” will soon expand as the life of artist Mark Rothko is about to be portrayed by Russell Crowe&nbsp;in Rothko. Mark Rothko is best known for his “color field” paintings of large fields of bright colors in squares or rectangles. Rothko will be directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (Fifty Shades of Grey, Nowhere Boy). The Rothko cast will include Irish actress Aisling Fraciosi (as Rothko’s daughter), Jared Harris, Michael Stuhlbarg, and the director’s husband Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Pietro from Marvel’s Avengers: Age of Ultron). Adapted from the book The Legacy of Rothko by Lee Seldes, Rothko will focus on “the protracted legal dispute between Kate Rothko and the painter’s estate executors and the directors of his gallery, Marlborough Fine Art,” which you can read more about here.4. MELISSA MCCARTHY TO PORTRAY MAJOR MARVEL VILLAIN IN THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER… SORT OF(Photo by Hopper Stone/©Columbia Pictures)Some of the funniest surprises in Taika Waititi’s Thor: Ragnarok (Certified Fresh at 93%) came early in the film when we first saw some Asgardian actors depicting the events of earlier Thor movies, including Matt Damon as Loki, Sam Neill as Odin, and Chris Hemsworth’s brother Luke Hemsworth as Thor. There has been a fair amount of new coverage of actors like Matt Damon returning to Australia for filming of the fourth movie, Thor: Love and Thunder (5/6/2022), but this week, we actually heard about someone new. Several photos have emerged online this week&nbsp;of comedic actress Melissa McCarthy in costume on the sets in Australia as the villainous character Hela, as portrayed by Cate Blanchett in Thor: Ragnarok, with the other actors-playing-actors like Matt Damon also on set with McCarthy. In similar news, we also learned this week that the upcoming sports comedy sequel Space Jam: A New Legacy (7/6/2021) will also feature&nbsp;cameo appearances by some of Warner Bros’ other film properties, including Batman, Mad Max, and Casablanca.5. THIS WEEK IN MUSICAL BIOPICS: BOB MARLEY, AND ROBBIE WILLIAMS (AS A MONKEY?)&nbsp;(Photo by Everett Collection)Although both films are now a few years old, the box office successes of Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman (Certified Fresh at 89%) continue to have a ripple effect on other musical biopics getting produced. That includes musical biopic projects which have languished in development for years, or in some cases, decades. The life story of famed reggae musician Bob Marley is one such example. Paramount Pictures is finally getting closer to production with the news this week that the studio has hired director Reinaldo Marcus Green, who comes&nbsp;to the Bob Marley biopic even as he continues work on another biographical film, King Richard, about the father (played by Will Smith) of future tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. In a sad coincidence, the movement on the Bob Marley biopic comes in the same week that saw&nbsp;the passing of Marley’s musical partner Bunny Wailer at the age of 73. British pop star Robbie Williams is also getting a biopic&nbsp;called Better Man to be directed by Michael Gracey (The Greatest Showman). In a bizarre revelation, this week, Deadline reported that the role of Robbie Williams will be portrayed by a “CGI monkey,” apparently, quite seriously.6. DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS MOVIE CASTS DETECT EVIL SPELL ON HUGH GRANT(Photo by Jay Maidment/©Warner Bros. Pictures)Actor Jeremy Irons has had a film career with many great heights, but one of his lowest lows may have come in 2000, when he starred as the evil villain in the first Dungeons &amp; Dragons feature film (Rotten at 10%). One has to speculate that Hugh Grant is hoping for a better result with his decision this week to take the role of the main villain (called Forge Fletcher) in the new Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie (5/27/2022). Sophia Lillis, who has recently starred as both Nancy Drew and Beverly in the IT movies, has also take a role as a character named Doric (neither of these names seem to point towards popular characters from existing D&amp;D stories). This new Dungeons &amp; Dragons reboot is being written and directed by the team of Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, who also collaborated on Game Night (Certified Fresh at 85%). It is not yet known if the Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie will be set entirely in a fantasy world, or if some part of it might also depict “real world” players. Hugh Grant and Sophia Lillis are joining a cast which already includes&nbsp;Regé-Jean Page (Bridgerton), Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, and Justice Smith.7. WRINKLE IN TIME STAR STORM REID MAY GET LOST IN SEARCHING 2(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Although it wasn’t a box office blockbuster, the independent social media mystery drama Searching (Certified Fresh at 92%) was still a surprise hit relative to its budget. Jon Cho and Michelle La starred as father and daughter in the first Searching, but apparently for the upcoming sequel, a new cast is being sought as the formula will be applied to a new family and setting. We don’t know specifically how different or similar the sequel’s premise will be, so we have relatively little to guess on, but we can report that 17 year old actress Storm Reid&nbsp;is now in talks for a lead role in Searching 2. Reid made her feature film debut in 12 Years a Slave, had the lead role in A Wrinkle in Time, and is also one of Zendaya’s co-stars in HBO’s Euphoria.8. HELLO KITTY FINALLY GETTING HER BIG SHOT AT THE MEOW-VIES(Photo by Saban International courtesy Everett Collection)The Japanese design company Sanrio has had over 45 years of success with their popular Hello Kitty character, including in the United States, but for the most part, attempts to carry Hello Kitty over in formats like TV or the movies have not taken off outside of Japan. Back in October of 2019, we reported that New Line Cinema had acquired the film rights to&nbsp;Hello Kitty, but we hadn’t heard much since then.&nbsp;This week, we finally got confirmation&nbsp;that the studio is actively developing a Hello Kitty feature film that will combine live action and animation (like this week’s Tom and Jerry). New Line Cinema has hired two directors for their Hello Kitty movie: Jennifer Coyle and Leo Matsuda. Coyle’s credits as director&nbsp;include 23 episodes of DC Super Hero Girls and 13 episodes of Bob’s Burgers, while Matsuda’s credits are mostly as an animator or story artist on projects like The Simpsons Movie, Wreck-It Ralph, and Zootopia.9. JONATHAN MAJORS TO STAR IN MILITARY DRAMA 892(Photo by The Washington Post/Getty Images)One of the shows that premiered right in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic when many people were hungry for something to binge was HBO’s spooky Lovecraft Country, starring Jonathan Majors. In the months since, Majors was able to translate that show’s success to a new gig at Marvel Studios as one of the company’s most prolific super villains, Kang the Conqueror, in the sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (TBA 2022). This week, Majors signed on for another project, which will be a drama called 892 about a marine war veteran who suffers from PTSD. In somewhat related news, following recent allegations, rapper-turned-actor T.I. will not be returning for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania after co-starring in the first two Ant-Man movies. It is unclear if this was always the plan, or if Marvel Studios is&nbsp;making the change&nbsp;based on the allegations against T.I. and his wife Tameka “Tiny” Harris. Likewise, we also don’t know if the other Ant-Man supporting characters played by Michael Peña and David Dastmalchian will be returning or not.On an Apple device?

Chu to Helm Live-Action Lilo &amp; Stitch, and More Movie NewsA Quiet Place gets a spinoff, Mads Mikkelsen replaces Johnny Depp in Fantastic Beasts 3, and new roles for Jake Gyllenhaal, Selena Gomez, and Chris Pratt.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 13, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;such titles&nbsp;as the remakes of Lilo &amp; Stitch, The Scorpion King, and Short Circuit.This WEEK’S TOP STORYCRAZY RICH ASIANS DIRECTOR JOHN M. CHU TO HELM LIVE-ACTION&nbsp;LILO &amp; STITCH(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection, (c)Walt Disney courtesy Everett Collection)Earlier this year (just a few months after Disney+ launched), the news broke that Disney’s live-action remake of the 2002 animated hit Lilo &amp; Stitch ( Certified Fresh at&nbsp; 86%), which was first announced&nbsp;two years ago in 2018, was being developed as a Disney+ movie (a la Lady and the Tramp). Well, it appears that it&nbsp;might be considered for&nbsp;for&nbsp;a theatrical release after all. That’s because the latest news on the remake is that Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, Now You See Me 2) is now in talks with Walt Disney Pictures to direct the live-action Lilo &amp; Stitch. We should note immediately that the remake is more appropriately called a live-action/CGI hybrid, since&nbsp;Stitch (and the other alien characters) will almost certainly be computer-animated, while Lilo and her Hawaiian friends and family will be played by live-action talent. Jon M. Chu’s next film as director will be the adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s In the Heights, which is now scheduled for release on June 18, 2021 after being pushed back almost a full year by the COVID-19 pandemic.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;JEFF NICHOLS TO DIRECT&nbsp;A QUIET PLACE SPINOFF(Photo by Ben Rothstein/©Warner Bros.)If the COVID-19 pandemic had never happened, A Quiet Place Part II would have come out eight months ago (March 20, 2020) as of next Friday. Around that time, John Krasinski was quoted online as saying he had an idea for a third Quiet Place movie, but before that ever happens, it sounds like we’re going to get something different in the form of a spinoff that expands the franchise’s cinematic universe instead. Granted, this spinoff is also based on a story idea by John Krasinski, so it’s quite possible that it’s the same idea he talked about back in March. The third film is expected to expand the post-apocalyptic world in which human survivors are stalked by monsters with super-sensitive hearing. Krasinski directed the first two movies (and appeared in both along with his wife Emily Blunt), but the third film will be directed by Jeff Nichols, marking the first time he’s worked on a “franchise film” after several of his own projects, including Mud (Certified Fresh at 97%), Midnight Special (Certified Fresh at 84%), and Loving (Certified Fresh at 89%). Paramount Pictures is reportedly aiming to release the third Quiet Place movie sometime in 2022. A Quiet Place Part II, starring Blunt, Cillian Murphy, and Djimon Hounsou, is currently scheduled for April 23, 2021, which is over a&nbsp;year after the sequel’s original release date. Although no casting has been announced yet for this third Quiet Place, it’s worth noting that Michael Shannon has starred (Shotgun Stories, Take Shelter, Midnight Special) or co-starred in every one of Jeff Nichols films so far, so it’s reasonable to assume we might see him hiding from monsters soon, too.2.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN CHRIS PRATT:&nbsp;THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER AND&nbsp;SAIGON BODYGUARDS(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Chris Pratt wrapped filming this week on Jurassic World: Dominion (6/10/2022), and&nbsp;his name is already&nbsp;attached to two new movies. The higher profile project of the two is also the least surprising, especially for anyone who saw Avengers: Endgame, which ended with Chris Hemsworth’s Thor going off into space with the Guardians of the Galaxy. Having said that, it’s still of interest that Pratt will indeed be reuniting with another of Marvel’s Chrises — namely Hemsworth —&nbsp;for Thor: Love and Thunder (2/11/2021). Perhaps the real news here is that we’re only&nbsp;hearing about Chris Pratt, and not, say, Dave Bautista (Drax), Zoe Saldana (Gamora), and Karen Gillan (Nebula). In related news, James Gunn confirmed this week that he has finished the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 screenplay. Meanwhile, Pratt also signed on this week&nbsp;with Universal Pictures (the studio behind the&nbsp;Jurassic&nbsp;franchise) to co-star in Saigon Bodyguards (with Wolf Warrior star Wu Jing), which will be a remake of the 2016 Vietnamese action comedy of the same title, and which will be co-produced by frequent Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo.3.&nbsp;MADS MIKKELSEN MAY REPLACE JOHNNY DEPP IN&nbsp;FANTASTIC BEASTS 3(Photo by Jonathan Olley/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)In last week’s Weekly Ketchup, we linked to a Collider piece that&nbsp;speculated about nine actors who could possibly replace Johnny Depp as Gellert Grindelwald in the upcoming sequel Fantastic Beasts 3 (due out in theaters on July 15, 2022). Well, it would appear&nbsp;Collider&nbsp;was on the right track with one of their choices, as Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen is indeed reportedly now in talks to take over as Grindelwald in the sequel. Mikkelsen has been very prolific over the last&nbsp;decade or so, but most fans probably know him best either as&nbsp;the milky-eyed villain Le Chiffre in&nbsp;Casino Royale, Jyn Erso’s dad in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, or the TV version of serial killer Hannibal Lecter. Filming of Fantastic Beasts 3 had already&nbsp;begun in London in September, so the&nbsp;role switch will necessitate some reshoots (Depp reportedly only shot one scene), which is presumably part of why the release date has been moved back from November 21, 2021 to July 15, 2022 (that, and the COVID-19 pandemic, probably). As for the “why” behind Depp’s departure from the sequel, you can read more about that right here, and also in this piece, in which it’s revealed that Johnny Depp will still receive his full salary&nbsp;as part of the deal for him to drop out.4. OPRAH WINFREY AND BRAD PITT TEAMING UP FOR TA-NEHISI COATES ADAPTATION(Photo by Bennett Raglin/Getty Images)Ta-Nehisi Coates is a multiple award-winning journalist-turned-author who has received a Genius Grant from the MacArthur Foundation, has worked for Marvel Comics on both Black Panther and Captain America, and whose first novel The Water Dancer was published last year. Now, Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Films and Brad Pitt’s Plan B production companies are teaming with MGM for a film adaptation of&nbsp;The Water Dancer, which will be adapted from Coates’ own screenplay. Combining elements of&nbsp;magic realism, The Water Dancer tells the story of a pre-Civil-War slave who discovers he has a superpower he calls “conduction” that allows him to travel great distances, which he then uses as a member of the Underground Railroad. No director has been announced yet, but the wording of the Hollywood Reporter piece suggests that the job could go to producer Kamilah Forbes, who theatrically directed Coates’ Between the World and Me.5. BLACK PANTHER STAR DANAI GURIRA TO&nbsp;PLAY&nbsp;THE FIGHTING SHIRLEY CHISHOLM(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)Back when Stephen Colbert played a political blowhard named Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report, one of his running gags in his “Better Know a District” segment was to always use the word “Fighting” (as in “Wisconsin’s Fighting Fifth District”). Colbert hardly invented that usage, but it was still so well used by him that it’s one of the jokes that still resonates years later. In that spirit, one has to wonder if, in the near future, when Danai Gurira (Black Panther, The Walking Dead) inevitably appears on Colbert’s CBS show to promote The Fighting Shirley Chisholm, he might bring back that exclamation. As the title suggests, Gurira will portray New York congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, who made history in 1968 as the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Congress, and in 1972 became the first African American candidate to run for a major party’s nomination for President of the United States. It should be noted that this film will not be a traditional biopic, but will instead be a drama set specifically during Chisholm’s 1972 run for president. Chisholm was also one of the lead characters in this year’s Mrs. America mini-series, and the subject of the documentary Chisholm ’72. Danai Gurira is taking over the role&nbsp;for Viola Davis, who had previously been attached to star.6. AIN’T NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH FOR SELENA GOMEZ(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Singer and actress Selena Gomez has had a series of health issues over the last several years, including lupus and a kidney transplant, and for her newest film project, she will be taking on the story of a woman who similarly faced physical challenges. Selena Gomez is now attached to star as Peruvian mountaineer&nbsp;Silvia Vasquez-Lavado, “who became the first Peruvian woman to summit Mount Everest and the first openly gay woman to complete the Seven Summits, a challenge to climb the highest mountain on each continent.” The project is titled In the Shadow of the Mountain, and it will be directed by Elgin James (Little Birds, Mayans M.C.), who will also adapt the screenplay.7. BELOVED 1980S ROBOT COMEDY SHORT CIRCUIT TO GET LATINX REMAKE(Photo by (c)TriStar Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)The movies of the 1980s are routinely held in high regard, sometimes out of pure nostalgia, but let’s be real here for a moment: not all of these films have aged especially well. Consider, for example, the 1986 science fiction comedy Short Circuit (Rotten at 59%), which is ostensibly a light-hearted adventure about a sweet robot named Johnny-5… until you remember that the film also featured Fisher Stevens in brown-face pretending to be an Indian scientist (something Aziz Ansari later talked to Stevens about). That said, Hollywood may soon get the chance to do the Short Circuit concept justice without the implied squirms that come from cultural appropriation, because Spyglass Media Group is now developing a Latinx remake&nbsp;of&nbsp;the film. The remake will be adapted by the writing team of Eduardo Cisneros (co-writer of Eugenio Derbez’s Instructions Not Included, Rotten at 57%) and producer-turned-screenwriter Jason Shuman. It’s not yet known what a “Latinx remake of Short Circuit” exactly means, or who will star in it, but one has to guess that given their connections, Eugenio Derbez may be one of the possible stars.8. JAKE GYLLENHAAL TO DRIVE MICHAEL BAY’S AMBULANCE REMAKE(Photo by Anne Marie Fox/TM &amp; ©Copyright Fox Searchlight)After spending much of the last decade working on various Transformers movies, Michael Bay made the transition last year to Netflix with 6 Underground (Rotten at 36%), and recently, we learned that his next film is likely to be a remake of the 2005 Danish thriller Ambulancen (which is easily discernable as Danish for Ambulance). New projects get announced all the time,&nbsp;some of which&nbsp;we never hear of again, but Ambulance very quickly made its next step through development this week&nbsp;as Jake Gyllenhaal is now in talks to star in Bay’s Ambulance remake, which Univeral Pictures is also reportedly also in talks to distribute. The premise is reportedly being kept “under wraps” (which is a bit funny,&nbsp;considering the film is a remake), but it is being compared to “the great action thrillers of the ’90s like Speed and Bay’s Bad Boys.”9. DWAYNE JOHNSON DEVELOPING A&nbsp;SCORPION KING&nbsp;REBOOT(Photo by (c)Universal courtesy Everett Collection)After five movies (six, if you include The Mummy Returns, Rotten at 47%), Universal Pictures is now developing a reboot of The Scorpion King, the mythological warrior-king who started as a Mummy spinoff. Dwayne Johnson didn’t star as The Scorpion King in any of the sequels&nbsp;— three different actors did: Michael Copon, Victor Webster, and Zach McGowan — but his Seven Bucks Productions is partnering&nbsp;with Universal Pictures on this reboot. Universal is looking for a new actor to take over&nbsp;the title role, and the reboot is also not expected to tie into The Mummy in the way the character originally did in The Mummy Returns. It’s also not yet known if Dwayne Johnson might&nbsp;join for a role other than that of The Scorpion King (maybe he could be the “Brendan Fraser” this time around?). The Mummy Returns was Dwayne Johnson’s feature film acting debut, which is reportedly why he loves The Scorpion King so much, and is shepherding this remake. Although little is known about the new film at this point, one detail that has already been revealed is that, rather than being an adventure set in ancient times, the reboot will move the setting to “modern times,” which actually makes it more like Tom Cruise’s The Mummy (Rotten at 16%) than the three Brendan Fraser movies, which were set in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, respectively. For the Scorpion King reboot, Universal Pictures has hired screenwriter Jonathan Herman, who received an Academy Award nomination for Universal’s Straight Outta Compton&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 89%), and who also worked with Universal on next year’s F9&nbsp;and the studio’s upcoming remakes of Fear (Rotten at 46%) and Scarface (Certified Fresh at 82% ).On an Apple device?

For example, one rumor that circulated over the fall involved the possibility of replacing Boseman as T’Challa, which Marvel confirmed earlier this month they would not do. We can now report that Black Panther II is indeed scheduled to start filming in July, 2021 with the sequel’s emphasis now shifting to T’Challa’s sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), who in the comics did take the title of Black Panther in 2005 when T’Challa was seriously injured. Director Ryan Coogler (Creed, Black Panther) will return for Black Panther II, as are Black Panther stars Angela Bassett, Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke, and, obviously, Letitia Wright. The first new cast member to be announced is Tenoch Huerta (Netflix’s Narcos: Mexico) as one of the film’s antagonists, but we don’t yet know anything about who that might be. Black Panther II is currently scheduled for release on May 6, 2022, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, that date (like all release dates) could be subject to change.Other Top Headlines1. KRISTEN STEWART PREPARING TO PLAY PRINCESS DI NEXT YEAR IN SPENCER(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Many shows were not able to air as usual this fall because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but one series that did recently premiere a new season was Netflix’s The Crown. Season 4 of The Crown (Certified Fresh at 97%), which premiered on Netflix on November 15, 2020, focuses on the 1980s and the character arcs of two very different women: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Lady Diana Spencer, the future Diana, Princess of Wales, as played by relative newcomer Emma Corrin. We will soon see another actress’ depiction of Princess Di, as Kristen Stewart is now preparing&nbsp;for her starring role in Spencer, which will start filming in early 2021. Talking about the film this week, Stewart confirmed that she has indeed watched season 4 of The Crown, saying, “Luckily, there’s no overlap time-wise, and also historically, and tonally, they’re very different, so I’m really cool with it.” Rather than being a true biopic, Spencer will focus on one of Princess Diana’s “final Christmas holidays with the House of Windsor in their legendary Sandringham estate.” The Spencer screenplay was written by screenwriter Steven Knight (Eastern Promises, Allied, Locke), and the director will be Pablo Larrain, who previously directed the similar film Jackie (Certified Fresh at 87%), starring Natalie Portman as First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy; Portman went on to be nominated for the Best Actress Oscar that year. Kristen Stewart’s latest film, the Christmas-themed rom-com Happiest Season (Certified Fresh at 90%) premiered on Hulu Wednesday, November 25, 2020.2. NEIL PATRICK HARRIS JOINS THE NICOLAS-CAGE-PLAYING-NICOLAS-CAGE MOVIE(Photo by Jason Mendez/Everett Collection)For a while now, Nicolas Cage’s filmography has run the gamut from high profile Marvel movies (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse) to movies that even Nicolas Cage doesn’t remember starring in (we won’t name names). One project, however, that has attracted a lot of attention since its first announcement is The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, a dark comedy in which Cage will star as himself. The premise involves a wealthy Nicolas Cage superfan (Pedro Pascal of The Mandalorian and Game of Thrones) who hires Cage to perform highlights of his various movies at a point when Cage is particularly hard up for money. In addition to Pascal, Tiffany Haddish, and Sharon Horgan, the latest star to join&nbsp;The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is Neil Patrick Harris, as Cage’s agent. The casting of Neil Patrick Harris is particularly “on point” as Harris also has experience playing a comedic version of himself,&nbsp;namely in the three Harold and Kumar movies.3. TIFFANY HADDISH TO STAR IN SPINOFF JUMP STREET: NOW FOR HER PLEASURE(Photo by Michele K. Short/Universal Pictures)Nearly two years ago, the news broke that Tiffany Haddish and Awkwafina were in talks to star in a new 21 Jump Street movie, taking over where Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum left off in 22 Jump Street (Certified Fresh at 85%). Late 2018, however, seems a lot longer ago than a mere two years, thanks to “2020… everything,” so some may have thought that story was no longer active. That may be why the buried news recently that Haddish is now attached to star in a movie called 21 Jump Street: Now For Her Pleasure&nbsp;was as big of a story as it was. With Haddish confirmed, the news now might be that Awkwafina appears to no longer be involved, so the next question would be which actress might take that role instead. The reason 21 Jump Street: Now for Her Pleasure made the news is that its screenwriters, the sister team of Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Loeglin (of TV’s Bob’s Burgers) also recently signed with Marvel Studios&nbsp;to adapt the probably-R-rated sequel Deadpool 3, starring Ryan Reynolds.4. CHANNING TATUM JOINS MYSTERIOUS UNIVERSAL MONSTERS COMEDY(Photo by Claudette Barius/©Warner Bros.)In 2017, Universal Pictures’ plans for the Dark Universe Cinematic Universe fell apart&nbsp;following the disappointing returns for what would’ve been the first in the franchise, Tom Cruise’s The Mummy (Rotten at 16%). In the three years since, however, Universal has stayed both busy and productive with attempts to revive their Classic Universal Monsters in other ways, starting earlier this year with the reboot of The Invisible Man (Certified Fresh at 91%). The latest project comes to us at a particularly well-timed point, because it’s the same week that we found out that Tiffany Haddish is still attached to star in 21 Jump Street: Now for Her Pleasure. One of the 21 Jump Street stars, Channing Tatum, is reuniting with&nbsp;the directing team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who helmed the&nbsp;Jump Street movies) for a “modern-day tongue-in-cheek thriller inspired by Universal’s classic monster legacy,” to be written by screenwriter Reid Carolin (Magic Mike, Magic Mike XXL), who also came up with the project’s original idea. That’s the end of what we know right now about this comedic thriller’s concept, but this writer can’t help but remember what comedic franchise was also involved in interconnecting the various Universal Monsters back in the 1940s and 1950s: Abbott and Costello. Starting in 1948 with Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein, the comedy team had several adventures that included Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man, Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy. Could Channing Tatum be “Abbott” in a new take on those movies? Just a theory.5. 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE DIRECTOR ON THE HUNT FOR PREDATOR 5(Photo by Michele K. Short/©Paramount Pictures)Following the first Predator in 1987 and the sequel Predator 2 in 1990, there was a 20 year gap before there was another standalone Predator movie (not counting the crossovers with Alien) in 2010 with Predators (Fresh at 64%), and then another eight years before the fourth film, 2018’s The Predator (Rotten at 33%). For as ubiquitous as Predator seems in pop culture, those four movies combined only add up to a four movie global box office take of $443 million (from a combined budget of $178 million). And yet, Hollywood keeps trying to make Predator happen. 20th Century Studios (the new version of 20th Century Fox, post-Disney acquisition) is now developing a fifth&nbsp;standalone&nbsp;Predator&nbsp;movie to be directed by Dan Trachtenberg (10 Cloverfield Lane, Certified Fresh at 90%), working from a screenplay by Jack Ryan producer Patrick Aison. No other details are known about what Trachtenberg has planned for the fifth Predator movie.6. CHRIS COLUMBUS&nbsp;TO (STILL) SPEND FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY’S(Photo by Joseph Lederer/©Fox Atomic)Back in 2018, the news broke that director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone) had signed on to write, direct and produce&nbsp;an adaptation of the popular horror video game franchise Five Nights at Freddy’s, about a spooky Chuck E. Cheese-style restaurant. Given that amount of time (and everything else that’s happened in 2020), one might have thought that the Five Nights at Freddy’s movie had long since fallen apart, but this week, the creator of the game franchise, Scott Cawthon gave an update to state quite the opposite. According to Cawthon, Chris Columbus has finished the screenplay adaptation and plans to start to filming for Blumhouse Productions in the spring of 2021. Cawthon also revealed a few of the different premises that were considered, including the one that appears to be moving forward (though one has to wonder why the movie can’t just be a direct adaptation of the video games themselves).7. CLIFFORD THE BIG RED DOG TEASER REVEALS TERRIFYING VISION OF THE FUTURE(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Some movies, especially if they’re based on popular franchises or properties, take a very long time to actually get developed, produced, and released in theaters. Consider, for example, the popular children’s book series (and animated TV series)&nbsp;Clifford the Big Red Dog. It was eight years ago in 2012&nbsp;that we first heard about a Clifford the Big Red Dog movie, which at one point was scheduled for release on April 8, 2016 (yes, over four years ago). More recently, Clifford the Big Red Dog was supposed to have come out earlier this month on November 13th (until the deadly virus delayed it all the way back to November 5, 2021). Clifford the Big Red Dog may now still be almost a year away, but Paramount Pictures decided this week to whet people’s appetites regardless, but what we actually got might have caught some people by surprise. Although Clifford the Big Red Dog in book and animated TV form has a very “cartoony” look, the movie appears to be applying a more “life-like CGI” approach, which, when you also factor in his size and (unnatural) coloring, makes actually seeing Clifford the Big Red Dog something you have to experience for yourself.On an Apple device?

Perhaps even more surprisingly, The Irishman did not receive a wide release in theaters, but was still seen as a success. On the heels of that success, Netflix&nbsp;announced plans this week to break their own record with a spy action-thriller called The Gray Man, which will have a production budget north of $200 million. Chris Evans (Marvel’s Captain America) and Ryan Gosling will star in The Gray Man, which will be adapted from&nbsp;the novel of the same name&nbsp;by screenwriter Joe Russo&nbsp;and directed by Russo and his brother Anthony Russo, who are best known for&nbsp;the Marvel movies&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 91%), Avengers: Infinity War (Certified Fresh aty 85%), and Avengers: Endgame (Certified Fresh at 94%). As the source novel is the first in a successful series, Netflix reportedly hopes to start a new action franchise comparable to James Bond. The Gray Man will tell the story of a deadly cat-and-mouse came as one assassin (Gosling) called “The Gray Man” is hunted down across the world by another agent (Chris Evans). It’s worth noting, since the Russo Brothers are so tied to “comic book movies,” that Netflix’s The Gray Man has no connection to the DC Comics character of the same name. It’s also worth noting that Joe Russo is the writer of the Netflix original film&nbsp;Extraction, which starred the MCU’s Chris Hemsworth and became the streaming service’s&nbsp;most-watched movie of all time&nbsp;when it premiered in late April.Other Top Headlines1. TO ALL THE BOYS’ NOAH CENTINEO&nbsp;JOINS DWAYNE JOHNSON’S BLACK ADAM(Photo by ©Netflix)DC Comics’ Justice Society of America is a super team that some fans are just now discovering because of Stargirl on The CW, but it actually has a history dating back to the early 1940s&nbsp;as the very first comic book superhero team ever. Some JSA members are tricky to comprehend because of those 80 years of continuity, but one of them is the original Atom (who was “short” but not to be confused with the Atoms who can shrink), who was then followed by his super-strong godson (now called Atom Smasher). There have been rumors before this week that Dwayne Johnson’s upcoming Black Adam (12/22/2021) will, in addition to being a Shazam! spinoff, also feature some members of the Justice Society of America, and this week, Atom Smasher became the first to be confirmed. The actor joining Black Adam will be Noah Centineo, who is probably currently best known for his roles in a few different Netflix projects, including To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, Sierra Burgess is a Loser, and The Perfect Date. When production of Black Adam starts off in Georgia in early 2021, the film will be directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who also directed Johnson in Disney’s upcoming theme park attraction adaptation Jungle Cruise (6/20/2021).2. JON HAMM TO&nbsp;STAR IN REBOOT OF CHEVY CHASE COMEDY&nbsp;FLETCH(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Hollywood obviously has a decades-long obsession with remaking films of yesteryear (they’ve actually been remaking movies since 1918), but the decade that has seemingly inspired the most remakes is the 1980s. Although he was quickly followed by stars like John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, and Eddie Murphy, the first Saturday Night Live star to leave the show for a movie career was Chevy Chase, and in 1985, he starred in the journalist comedy Fletch&nbsp;(Fresh at 77%), which was then followed in 1989 by the sequel Fletch Lives (Rotten at 37%). Director Kevin Smith has long&nbsp;wanted to reboot the franchise&nbsp;with a project called Fletch Won, starring Jason Lee (TV’s My Name is Earl), but that obviously never happened. Instead, the actor who is now attached to star&nbsp;in the Fletch reboot, based on the eleven original novels by Gregory McDonald, is Jon Hamm. The new Fletch&nbsp;will be directed by Greg Mottola (Superbad, Adventureland), who previously worked with Hamm on the made-for-HBO movie Clear History (Fresh at 61%). You can read more about Jon Hamm’s other upcoming projects in this piece.3. PETER FARRELLY IS PRODUCING A&nbsp;WISHBONE MOVIE(Photo by ©Big Feats! Entertainment courtesy Everett Collection)Although some genres are still struggling in the movies compared to where they used to be (romantic comedies, westerns, etc), Hollywood appears to be content with the results they get from “dog movies.” (Harrison Ford’s Call of the Wild has been described as a box office bomb, but it also had to deal with the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.) One of the upcoming “dog movies” is the adaptation of the animated PBS series Clifford the Big Red Dog (11/13/2020 ), and this week, another canine PBS show is getting its own movie. Wishbone was a live-action show that ran on PBS from 1995 to 1997 in which&nbsp;Wishbone the dog taking on the personas of various literary characters&nbsp;each week,&nbsp;and now Green Book (Certified Fresh at 78%) director Peter Farrelly is attached to produce the Wishbone movie.&nbsp;As long as we’re on the subject, another dog movie in active development that was&nbsp;announced earlier this year is Arthur the King, starring Mark Wahlberg.4. THE OLD GUARD DIRECTOR GINA PRINCE-BYTHEWOOD TEAMS UP WITH VIOLA DAVIS FOR&nbsp;THE WOMAN KING(Photo by 20th Century Fox courtesy Everett Collection, Jason Mendez/Everett Collection)You may recall that we almost got a Marvel Comics adaptation&nbsp;called Silver &amp; Black (about Silver Sable and Black Cat), which was once scheduled for February 8, 2019. That film was to have been directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love and Basketball, The Secret Life of Bees), who instead moved to Netflix where she directed their recent action movie&nbsp;The Old Guard (Certified Fresh at 81%). It appears that the good will from The Old Guard has resulted in a pretty quick benefit for Prince-Bythewood, because she has already set up an ambitious period drama&nbsp;at TriStar Pictures called The Woman King. Viola Davis will star in The Woman King as Nanisca, a general of an all-female military unit in the Kingdom of Dahomey, an African nation that once existed in the area that is now Benin. The other lead role in The Woman King will be Nanisca’s daughter, Nawi, who reportedly was almost played by Lupita Nyong’o. In related news, Charlize Theron is already talking about possible sequel plans for The Old Guard.5.&nbsp;HENRY GOLDING TO VOICE LEAD IN CHINESE ZODIAC-INSPIRED&nbsp;THE TIGER’S APPRENTICE(Photo by Sanja Bucko/©Warner Bros. Pictures)Some of this year’s animated features ended up releasing (or will be released) on Video on Demand&nbsp;due to widespread theater closures&nbsp;(Trolls World Tour, Scoob!, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run in 2021), but Hollywood appears to be otherwise committing to&nbsp;keeping other future animated movies in theaters (when the world goes back to having any movies released). One of those companies is Paramount Animation, who is continuing development on a project called The Tiger’s Apprentice, which will be inspired by elements of the Chinse Zodiac. We can now report that&nbsp;the lead character, a talking tiger, will be voiced by Henry Golding, who first came to attention as the male lead in the 2018 romantic comedy Crazy Rich Asians. Golding’s next big movie role will be as Snake Eyes (10/23/2020), in a spinoff movie for the popular G.I. Joe character.6. IS JENNIFER GREY MAKING A DIRTY DANCING SEQUEL SET IN THE 1990S?(Photo by (c)Vestron Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)For the most part, “movie rumors” don’t get covered by major souces like Variety and Deadline, which is basically where we draw the line between “rumors” and confirmed news stories to begin with. This week, however, both of those sources ran with a story that is still firmly being described as a rumor. Reportedly, Dirty Dancing (Fresh at 69%) and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off star Jennifer Grey&nbsp;is partnering with Lionsgate to produce “an unique dance movie” which she will star in and produce. The mystery project, which is also set in the 1990s, is rumored to possibly be a sequel&nbsp;to Dirty Dancing. If true, Grey would presumably be playing the 40-something older version of “Baby” from Dirty Dancing, but it’s anyone’s guess what that character might be doing 30 years later after that one memorable summer in the Catskills in 1963. We should also point out that Dirty Dancing already had a “re-imagining” in 2004 with Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights (Rotten at 23%), and a TV movie remake in 2017 (Rotten at 19%).7. RIVERDALE STAR KJ APA TO HEADLINE MICHAEL BAY’S PANDEMIC THRILLER(Photo by Jack Rowand/©The CW)Amidst all of the speculation about how most Hollywood productions will get going again, we’ve also been hearing about producer Michael Bay’s project called Songbird, which is inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic we’re all currently living in. Set two years in the future, Songbird will be told “through the eyes of the characters,” and we now know that the two leads will be KJ Apa (Archie on TV’s Riverdale) and Sofia Carson, one of the stars of Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists. Filming of Songbird reportedly started on location in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Apa will play an essential worker who is able to deliver to people, including his girlfriend (Carson), due to his having a rare immunity to the disease. Demi Moore will also have a supporting role.8. JEAN SMART TO STAR IN LATEST FROM&nbsp;TATE TAYLOR(Photo by Jason Mendez/Everett Collection)Director Tate Taylor is probably best known for his frequent collaborations with actress Octavia Spencer (like The Help and the thriller Ma), but he’s also done movies like The Girl on the Train with other lead actresses. For his next movie, Taylor has recruited&nbsp;veteran character actor Jean Smart, who’s coming off her recent supporting role in HBO’s Watchmen mini-series (playing the same Silk Spectre character depicted in the 2009 movie&nbsp;by Malin Akerman). Jean Smart will be starring in the movie, called Miss Macy, as an “eccentric” woman who becomes a mentor to a young girl. The screenplay was adapted by screnwriter Beth Henley (Crimes of the Heart, Nobody’s Fool). Miss Macy will be produced by Amblin Partners, the production company that spun out from Steven Spielberg’s DreamWorks Pictures, and which has recently produced 1917, Dark Waters, First Man, and Ready Player One.9. UNIVERSAL’S CLASSIC MONSTERS FRANCHISE WILL INCLUDE A KIDS MOVIE(Photo by ©TriStar Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Univeral Pictures’ previous plan for a “Dark Universe” built around reboots of their Universal Classic Monsters famously&nbsp;fell apart in 2017&nbsp;following the disappointing box office for Tom Cruise’s The Mummy, but the studio did not give up on the idea of reboots. Their new strategy paid off this year, just before the pandemic fully hit, with The Invisible Man (Certified Fresh at 91%), which was both a box office and critical hit. Other “classic monsters” projects&nbsp;Universal now has in the works include a remake&nbsp;of The Wolfman (starring Ryan Gosling) and a project called Dark Army from director Paul Feig (we don’t yet know what that one’s about). We can also add to the list a family-friendly movie&nbsp;called Little Monsters from the director of Toy Story 4, which will reportedly feature various characters from Universal’s monster roster. That concept has sort of already been done a few times, including movies like The Monster Squad and Adam Sandler’s animated Hotel Transylvania franchise, but the difference here is Universal Pictures’ “official” stamp of approval (Hotel Transylvania, for example, is a Sony Pictures franchise).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Spectrum, 2021, Academy, TCA, Fox, bad, dceu, drama, robots, NBC, Bravo, Comic, on, Office","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/17155849/Gosling_Evans-Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"ryan-gosling-chris-evans-and-the-russo-brothers-team-up-for-new-netflix-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509170051279","title":"Kelly Marie Tran Will Make History in Raya and the Last Dragon, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kelly Marie Tran Will Make History in Raya and the Last Dragon, and More Movie NewsThe Thing and The Nutty Professor get rebooted, DC FanDome unleashes tons of new details, and new films for Amy Adams, Taron Egerton, and the director of Black Is King.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 28, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as The Batman, The Color Purple, The Nutty Professor, and The Thing.This WEEK’S TOP STORYKELLY MARIE TRAN WILL MAKE HISTORY IN&nbsp;RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)Despite the delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on live-action production, many animated projects appear to be moving forward with fewer delays. One of these is Walt Disney Animation’s Raya and the Last Dragon, which was indeed pushed back from its original release date of November 25, 2020 to March 12, 2021. Although that move initially appeared to be due to general trends and not the film’s production itself, it turns out that wasn’t necessarily the case, as Walt Disney Pictures is indeed using those extra four months to recast the voice lead, hire a new co-writer, and replace the film’s directors. Kelly Marie Tran, who played Rose Tico in the recent Star Wars sequels, is taking over the role of Raya, replacing Cassie Steele, which makes Tran, who is&nbsp;Vietnamese American, the first person of Southeast Asian heritage to voice the lead role in a Disney animated feature. The film’s new directors are Don Hall (Big Hero 6, Moana) and Carlos Lopez Estrada (Blindspotting), and the film’s newest screenwriter is Qui Nguyen (Vietgone). Awkwafina, who is voicing the titular dragon, remains attached as Tran’s co-star; she will also co-star in Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings next year on May 7, 2021.Other Top Headlines1. BLUMHOUSE PARTNERING WITH JOHN CARPENTER ON THE RETURN OF THE THING(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)The complicated thing about complaining about all remake projects is that some of the most beloved movies of all time were themselves also remakes, or at least retreads (The Wizard of Oz, The Maltese Falcon, etc.) The “sci-fi horror” genre in particular had a spate of “better than the original” remakes that arguably started in 1978 with Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Certified Fresh at 93%), and included John Carpenter’s The Thing (Certified Fresh at 84%), and David Cronenberg’s The Fly ( Certified Fresh at 92%). Universal Pictures attempted a return to The Thing in 2011 (Rotten at 35%) that actually turned out to be a prequel, and there have been other projects in recent years (in particular, one would be an adaptation of a recently discovered longer version of the original story&nbsp;Who Goes There? called Frozen Hell). Blumhouse recently did quite well with a horror remake —&nbsp;The Invisible Man, Certified Fresh at 91% —&nbsp;its strongest partnership just happens to be with Universal Pictures, the same studio behind The Thing. And so, that brings us to this week’s news that Blumhouse is now partnering with producer and director John Carpenter on a new reboot of his 1982 film. There are no premise updates (such as whether it will be a period piece set in the 1980s or set in modern times), but one thing we can guess is that Carpenter will probably not direct the remake, as he also gave over his Halloween franchise to David Gordon Green (Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends are coming in 2021 and 2022).2.&nbsp;DIRECTOR OF BEYONCE’S BLACK IS KING&nbsp;ADAPTING THE COLOR PURPLE MUSICAL(Photo by Disney+)A year after voicing Nala in Disney’s computer animated remake of The Lion King (Rotten at 52%), Beyonce released a musical companion to the 2019 album&nbsp;The Lion King: The Gift&nbsp;called Black is King&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 98%) on Disney+. Now, Black is King director Blitz Bazawule (A.K.A.&nbsp;Blitz the Ambassador) has signed on with Warner Bros. for another movie musical, which is the studio’s adaptation of the Tony-winning Broadway musical The Color Purple. Reportedly, several of the musical’s producers, including Oprah Winfrey, Quincy Jones, and Steven Spielberg, all saw Bazawule’s movie The Burial of Kojo on Netflix and “were wowed by his vibrant visual style.” Winfrey, of course, co-starred with Whoopi Goldberg in the original feature adaptation of&nbsp;The Color Purple&nbsp;(Fresh at 81%), which was directed by Spielberg, and whose music was composed by Jones. Screenwriter Marcus Gardley (The Chi, NOS4A2) is adpating the Broadway musical, which was itself a reimaging of Alice Walker’s novel The Color Purple, upon which Spielberg’s movie was based. It’s not yet known if Warner Bros. will cast new performers (like, say, Beyonce) for the movie, recruit the Broadway cast, or perhaps a combination of both.3. AMY ADAMS JOINS BROADWAY HIT ADAPTATION DEAR EVAN HANSEN&nbsp;(Photo by Jef Hernandez/Everett Collection)The Color Purple isn’t the only recent Tony-winning Broadway hit getting a movie adaptation soon, as Universal Pictures is also getting ready to produce Dear Evan Hansen, which won six Tony Awards, including Best Actor (Ben Platt), Best Featured Actress, Best Score, and Best Musical. Ben Platt has long been attached to reprise his titular lead role, but Universal appears to be mostly attracting movie stars for many of the other parts, including Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, Certified Fresh at 97%) and Amandla Stenberg (The Hate U Give, Certified Fresh at 97%). We can now add&nbsp;Amy Adams&nbsp;to the list, as she will be playing the mother of Caitlyn Dever’s character (Colton Ryan has also been cast as Connor, a student whose death is central to the musical’s plot). Dear Evan Hansen&nbsp;will be directed by Stephen Chbosky (Wonder, Certified Fresh at 85%). There is currently no release date for Dear Evan Hansen, but Universal Pictures may be eyeing it as a possible late 2021 “awards season” contender.4. DC FANDOME PART 1: THE BATMAN, THE FLASH, THE SUICIDE SQUAD(Photo by @mattreevesLA)In the final days of a summer in which San Diego Comic-Con was severely diminished as a pop culture event by the COVID-19 pandemic, Warner Bros. held their own online event called DC FanDome. Although there were many interesting panels, trailers, and videos, the biggest single video to debut at DC FanDome was arguably the first trailer for The Batman (10/1/2021). In addition to Batman himself (Robert Pattinson), Catwoman (Zoe Kravitz), the Riddler (Paul Dano), and Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), sharp-eyed fans also noticed that we can see Colin Farrell as the Penguin, and really smart fans have already deciphered the Riddler’s “riddles” seen in the teaser/trailer. In related news, Barry Keoghan (Dunkirk, The Killing of a Sacred Deer) has joined The Batman as Gordon’s first partner, Stanley Menkel. In another DC FanDome event, we also got to see early concept art for Barry Allen’s new costume in the time travel adventure The Flash (6/3/2022). Director James Gunn had way more to show off for his version of The Suicide Squad (8/6/2021), including 29 set images, “pop art” style images for the film’s various villains/mercenaries, and a two-minute video with sneak peeks at some of the film’s action.5. DC FANDOME PART 2: BLACK ADAM, SHAZAM: FURY OF THE GODS(Photo by © Warner Bros. Pictures)Two of the other upcoming DC Comics movies that were spotlighted at DC FanDome are Dwayne Johnson’s Black Adam (12/22/2021) and the sequel Shazam: Fury of the Gods (11/4/2022), which are directly connected to each other because of Black Adam’s roots coming directly from the “Shazam” mythos. Following a big year on The CW as the stars of Stargirl, a version of the Justice Society of America was&nbsp;revealed through Black Adam concept art, although with only four members revealed (Atom-Smasher, Cyclone, Dr. Fate, and Hawkman), the Black Adam version seems like a much smaller roster than the comics (which in the past has sometimes included over a dozen members at once). You can also see lots of non-JSA concept images here.&nbsp;Shazam! star Zachary Levi was also on hand to reveal that the sequel’s title will be Shazam: Fury of the Gods, although the panel did not specify “which” gods in question are so furious, why, and at whom. Comedian Sinbad was also involved, which teased that “maybe” he might be in the sequel, although there’s a strong chance he was just there as a reference to the Internet’s most discussed example of “The Mandela Effect.”6.&nbsp;ADAM PALLY, AUBREY PLAZA&nbsp;JOIN&nbsp;BELUSHI BIOPIC(Photo by Priscilla Grant, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Some stars are so larger-than-life that they get multiple biopics. One such example is John Belushi, who was depicted by Michael Chiklis in Wired (Rotten at 4%) in 1989, just seven years after Belushi’s death in 1982 at the age of 33. The new biopic, to be titled just Belushi, made the news in December, as at that point, Broadway star Alex Brightman was expected to be starring as John Belushi. Possibly in the interest of attracting investors and financing, the producers of Belushi appear to be seeking more famous actors, as they are now in talks with Happy Endings co-star Adam Pally to play John Belushi instead. Two other major roles may also going to bigger names, as Ike Barinholtz (The Mindy Project) is in talks to play Belushi’s Blues Brothers collaborator Dan Aykroyd, and Aubrey Plaza may be cast as Belushi’s wife, Judith Belushi (Pisano). Belushi will be directed by David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada) from a screenplay by Steve Conrad (The Pursuit of Happyness; co-writer of Wonder).7. ARE YOU READY TO GET KLUMPED AGAIN? THE NUTTY PROFESSOR REBOOT IN THE WORKS(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)The pop culture obsession with the 1980s — and the rate at which movies from that era have inspired remakes — has arguably had an impact on how quickly movies from the 1990s are receiving their own remakes. Consider, for example, how many more remakes of 1980s movies there&nbsp;were in 2010 than there were 1990s remakes in 2020. The biggest comedy hit of 1996 was itself a remake, as Eddie Murphy took over the role as The Nutty Professor (Fresh at 64%) originated by Jerry Lewis in the 1963 original (Fresh at 85%). Both movies were about an awkward scientist who transforms himself into an alter ego called “Buddy Love,” but Eddie Murphy’s version also made the scientist morbidly obese (Jerry Lewis’ version was just goofy). The Nutty Professor is now getting a new reboot&nbsp;and it’s coming from the same production company that is currently prepare to film Scream 5, itself a continuation of one of the 1990s’ most popular franchises. It’s not yet known if this third iteration of The Nutty Professor will have any “horror” elements (one could see how it could easily drift into “body horror“), or if it will just be a straight up comedy romp.8. ROCKETMAN STAR TARON EGERTON TO SMUGGLE TETRIS TO THE MASSES(Photo by Giles Keyte/©20th Century Fox Film Corp.)The 1984 video game hit Tetris has been such an innocuous part of pop culture for decades now that it is easy to forget that (and many people may not even know this) it was actually invented during the final years of the USSR. Taron Egerton (Rocketman, Kingsman: The Secret Service) is now signed to star in Tetris, which will depict the cloak and dagger efforts that led to the original Tetris video game effectively being smuggled out of the USSR, including the involvement of the KGB. Egerton will play Dutch-born video game entrepeneur Henk Rogers, whose story Egerton is calling “definitely more Social Network than LEGO Movie.” That distinction is important to point out, as there have indeed been stories in the recent past about a Tetris movie (or a trilogy, even) that would have been a more direct “video game movie” adaptation. This is a different Tetris movie, to be directed by the same director as Stan &amp; Ollie&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 92%), even, to give you an idea of how&nbsp;unlike a video game movie it will probably be.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"halloween, Games, TV, on, quibi, 007, television, Photos, Christmas, movies, Crackle, Dead, Moore, Rock, space","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/28170314/Kelly_Marie_Tran-Raya_Last_Dragon-Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"kelly-marie-tran-will-make-history-in-raya-and-the-last-dragon-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509170025675","title":"Ryan Gosling to Star in David Leitch Action Film, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ryan Gosling to Star in David Leitch Action Film, and More Movie NewsMore movies are delayed, Chungking Express gets a sequel, the Yakuza video game goes to the big screen, and new projects for Tiffany Haddish, Ron Howard, Ice Cube, and Eva Longoria.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 25, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering new roles for stars like Tom Cruise, Ryan Gosling, and Tiffany Haddish.This WEEK’S TOP STORYRYAN GOSLING TO STAR IN DAVID LEITCH ACTION FILM(Photo by Richard Foreman Jr/©FilmDistrict)About seven years ago, the news broke that Dwayne Johnson was in talks to star in an adaptation of the 1980s action TV show The Fall Guy, which featured Lee Majors as a luckless stuntman who investigated crimes on the side (a formula that dominated TV of that era). That project never happened, and it appears to have fallen deeply out of development, but the premise of a movie about a stuntman is still relevant (and indeed, it’s what half of last year’s Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood was about). This week, after a “heated auction,” Universal Pictures has landed the rights to an untitled Hollywood stuntman action drama project that has Ryan Gosling attached to star for director David Leitch (Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw). Leitch is himself a former stuntman and stunt coordinator, and Ryan Gosling has already played a stuntman in two previous films (Drive and The Place Beyond the Pines). In their coverage of the deal, The Hollywood Reporter leans heavily into comparisons to The Fall Guy and Hollywood’s long interest in a Fall Guy movie, but at this point, there seems to be no confirmation that the movie actually is an adaptation of that TV show. Other studios that bid against Universal Pictures included MGM, Paramount, and Netflix.Other Top Headlines1. BOTH BLACK WIDOW AND WEST SIDE STORY NOW DELAYED UNTIL 2021(Photo by Marvel Studios)There are still some major movies scheduled for theatrical releases in the next few months (including No Time to Die, Pixar’s Soul,&nbsp;Dune, and&nbsp;Wonder Woman 1984), but this week, Walt Disney Pictures made big changes regarding several of their upcoming films, delaying more of their most anticipated titles. Marvel Studios’ first return to the MCU post Avengers: Endgame will be the prequel Black Widow, which is now scheduled for May 7, 2021 after originally being dated for May 1, 2020 and then more recently, November 6, 2020. This shift means that other Marvel movies are also being bumped back, starting with Eternals (now 11/5/2021) and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (now 7/9/2021). Disney also pushed back Steven Spielberg’s remake of West Side Story almost a full year from December 18, 2020 to December 10, 2021. In an interesting turn of events, that means that Lin-Manuel Miranda’s In the Heights (6/18/2021) is effectively opening before West Side Story again after&nbsp;it was rescheduled from its original June 26, 2020 release date earlier this year. The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to impact the movie release calendar, and these changes likely won’t be the last, so stay tuned for more updates.2. WONG KAR-WAI NOW WORKING ON SEQUEL TO 1994 CLASSIC CHUNGKING EXPRESS(Photo by Everett Collection)When Bong Joon-ho won big at this year’s Academy Awards for Parasite, including Best Picture, it shed some light on other acclaimed international filmmakers who in the past mostly had to settle for the Foreign Film category. One such director who has shockingly&nbsp;never been nominated for an Academy Award is Wong Kar-wai, whose filmography includes Fallen Angels, Happy Together, In the Mood for Love, and the 1996 arthouse hit Chungking Express (Certified Fresh at 87%). That film might seem like an odd choice to receive a sequel some 26+ years later, but according to Chinese authorities, that’s apparently exactly what Wong Kar-wai has planned, as he has submitted a screenplay called Chungking Express 2020&nbsp;that the Chinese government has approved to move into production. The plot summary offered in the filing is curious, as it first recounts the story of&nbsp;Chungking Express, which followed two separate stories involving police officers, and then describes a new scenario that takes place in the future: “In 2036, young Xiao Qian and May are unwilling to be held back by genetic partnerings, and insist on finding their own ‘destiny.'” It remains unclear if the new film will revisit the two stories of the first movie in some way.3. TIFFANY HADDISH JOINS NICOLAS CAGE META-COMEDY(Photo by Michele K. Short/Universal Pictures)Production will soon begin on the Lionsgate action-comedy The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, in which Nicolas Cage will play a fictionalized version of himself. The premise of the movie follows Cage as he accepts a million-dollar offer from a&nbsp;wealthy super-fan (played by Pedro Pascal)&nbsp;that leads to Cage being forced to re-enact some of his most popular classic movie scenes. This week, we found out who will be joining Pascal as another fictional character, as Tiffany Haddish has signed on to co-star in The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent as “an eccentric rogue government agent who forces superstar Nicolas Cage to go undercover in a crazy, off-book, last-ditch effort to bring one of the largest criminal organizations in Europe down for good.” It’s unclear if this “undercover” assignment is part of the main storyline involving Pedro Pascal’s character, or perhaps a b-story elsewhere in the movie (but it’s probably the former).4. RON HOWARD TO DIRECT BIOPIC ABOUT CHINESE PIANIST SUPERSTAR LANG LANG(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/©Universal Pictures)Chinese pianist Lang Lang is only 38 years old, but he has already received an international reception more typical of a classical musician twice his age.&nbsp;He’s also apparently impressed many within Hollywood’s upper echelons, because Ron Howard has signed on to direct an untitled Lang Lang biopic to be based on his memoir, Journey of a Thousand Miles. The planned biopic will depict Lang’s journey from a childhood in the northern Chinese city of Shenyang to fame both in China and across the entire world. It’s not yet known if Howard or his producing partners plan on casting Lang to play himself. In a statement about the film’s announcement, Lang Lang said, “Dream big, work hard, and always believe in yourself. This movie, thanks to Ron Howard’s vision, will inspire young people around the world to follow their dreams and never forget they are one in a million.”5. TOM CRUISE’S SPACE X TRIP OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED(Photo by ©Universal Pictures)Hollywood may move at its own languid pace, but it’s nothing compared to the last few decades of manned space exploration, which seems to have drastically slowed down following the amazing speed at which it developed in the 1960s and 1970s.&nbsp;One of the most surprising movie announcements of 2020 thus far came in May when Tom Cruise announced his plans to become the first movie star to actually film scenes for a major Hollywood production in outer space himself. This project got one step closer to actually happening this week&nbsp;as the official Twitter account for Space Shuttle Almanac formally added Tom Cruise’s outer space project to their list of planned missions. Commander Michael Lopez-Alegria will pilot a Space X Crew Dragon Axiom Tourist FLight in October, 2021 with Tom Cruise and director Doug Liman (American Made, Edge of Tomorrow) aboard, presumably with at least one other crew member to aid in whatever they have planned to film in space. There is no release date (or title) for Tom Cruise’s space movie yet, but given the late 2021 filming, we can probably expect it sometime in 2022 or perhaps 2023.6. EVA LONGORIA IS READY (TO DIRECT) A NICE LONG SPA DAY(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)After her long run on the hit ABC dramedy series Desperate Housewives, Eva Longoria has increasingly turned her attention towards a new career as producer and director, including several TV shows and plans for the Flamin’ Hot Cheetos movie (seriously). That film could eventually become Longoria’s directorial debut feature, but with pandemic delays wreaking havoc on production schedules, it’s anyone’s guess when that movie will even be released. In the meantime,&nbsp;Longoria added another movie to her possible future filmography this week, signing on with Sony Pictures to star in, produce, and direct a female ensemble action comedy called Spa Day. The premise is being kept secret for now, but it’s pretty easy to imagine what&nbsp;it&nbsp;will be like based on just the title, the genres, and the star and director. We’ve all seen movies.7. LONG-RUNNING SONY VIDEO GAME FRANCHISE YAKUZA GETTING ITS OWN MOVIE(Photo by Sega)This story is ostensibly about the long-running Yazuka video game franchise, but let’s start by remembering another similar video game. Shenmue was a 1999 game for the Sega Dreamcast set in the world of 1980s Japanese crime gangs (and martial arts), but the reason it’s particularly relevant here is that, in 2001, the cut scenes for the game were packaged together&nbsp;as Shenmue: The Movie. Fast forward twenty years, and it’s easy to argue that many video games could be adapted as movies that way (it would probably be a lot cheaper too). The Yakuza games — also published by Sega — are increasingly cinematic in that way, but this week’s news of plans for a Yakuza movie&nbsp;describe the film as “live action.”&nbsp;Yakuza is Sega’s second best-selling franchise after Sonic the Hedgehog, who made his super speed jump to the movies earlier this year, so it makes sense that the game publisher is now turning its attention towards getting a Yakuza movie produced as well. Variety describes the first Yakuza game this way: “Kazuma Kiryu [is] released from a 10-year prison sentence after taking the fall for the murder of his family’s patriarch, [and as] the entire Japanese underworld is pulled into the search for $100 million stolen from the vault of his former clan, Kiryu is forced back into the lawless world of the Yakuza.”8. UNIVERSAL TO TRY OUT FANCY NEW TECHNOLOGY WITH ICE CUBE SCI-FI MOVIE(Photo by Bob Mahoney/©Warner Bros.)The old school “studio system” of classic Hollywood may have gone away decades ago, but we do still see today movie stars who have strong relationships with specific studios. Rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube, for example, starred in Universal’s Ride Along (Rotten at 18%) and its sequel (Rotten at 13%), as well as the upcoming Flint Strong boxing biopic. Ice Cube is now signed to reunite with Universal Pictures on an untitled “grounded” science fiction project to be directed by frequent music video director Rich Lee. The premise hasn’t been revealed yet, except that it was compared to District 9, and the focus right now appears to be on the new screen capture technology that producer Timur Bekmambetov is bringing to the project.9. NEXT FATHER OF THE BRIDE REMAKE TO FOCUS ON LATINX FAMILY(Photo by ©Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Every once in a while in Hollywood’s history, there will be a remake so beloved that it’s actually more famous than the original — John Carpenter’s The Thing is a frequently cited example of that. Another remake that seems to have gone on to overshadow the legacy of the original movie is 1991’s Father of the Bride (Fresh at 70%), starring Steve Martin, which was actually a remake of the 1950 film&nbsp;starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor. We’re getting another reminder of the remake’s enduring popularity soon, as Netflix this week released the trailer for a special called Father of the Bride Part 3 (ish), which promises to reunite franchise stars like Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. We also learned this week that Warner Bros. has plans for another Father of the Bride remake, this time revolving around a Latinx family as a father deals with “his daughter’s upcoming wedding through the prism of multiple relationships within a big, sprawling Cuban-American family.” This new version&nbsp;is also being described as “more of a rom-com than previous versions of the film.” Screenwriter Matt Lopez, who has previously worked on other remakes like Disney’s Race to Witch Mountain (Rotten at 43%) and The Sorcerer’s Apprentice (Rotten at 40%) was reportedly influenced “by his own cross-cultural nuptials and the many epic Cuban weddings he has attended.”On an Apple device?

Because of that, it’s rare that a movie can be filmed in any sort of cloud of secrecy,&nbsp;though it has&nbsp;happened, even for sequels to major box office hits. The latter scenario is particularly relevant this week, as it has been revealed that British comic actor Sacha Baron Cohen has apparently “secretly” filmed a sequel&nbsp;to his 2006 hit comedy Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan ( Certified Fresh at 91% ), which earned over a quarter of a billion dollars worldwide from a budget of just $18 million. Social media reports earlier this summer first hinted that Cohen was up to something with his Borat character, and reportedly, Cohen has already started screening the sequel for industry insiders. Although there has been no official announcement just yet, the rumor is that in the sequel, Borat is now world famous, so he has to go undercover as other characters, which means the comedy is basically Cohen-as-Borat-as-Cohen’s other characters. The Borat sequel does not currently have an official distributor (so we don’t know if it will be theatrical, streaming, or otherwise), and therefore, there’s also no release date. We also don’t know if Sacha Baron Cohen will have any celebrity co-stars in the sequel.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;NEW RULES ANNOUNCED FOR THE ACADEMY AWARDS(Photo by Getty Images)It has now been five years&nbsp;since the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag first became viral. Since then, the Academy has gone through a series of moves to increase diversity, which has included inviting new members who as a group have more diverse backgrounds. This week, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences unveiled their next change, which is a set of rules for the Best Picture category that will take effect in 2024. As of that year, a feature film will need to meet qualification in two of the following four categories: #1 On-Screen Representation, Themes and Narratives; #2 Creative Leadership and Project Team; #3 Industry Access and Opportunities; and #4 Audience Development. Broadly, the first two criteria apply to the actual film, and the second two can be met by the studio or production company that make the movie. There has been some concern online that recent nominees like The Irishman or 1917 might have been challenged by these new rules, but in both cases (and many others), it’s likely that the studios would have qualified under the third or fourth categories (especially by 2024). It’s also important to point out that these criteria only apply to Best Picture, so a film could potentially be nominated in other categories without matching these specific new rules. Also this week, a recent study of the top box office hits from the last few years reportedly shows that straight, white men still dominate the film industry.2.&nbsp;WONDER WOMAN 1984 DELAYED AGAIN,&nbsp;CANDYMAN POSTPONED TO 2021(Photo by Warner Bros.)The COVID-19 pandemic has obviously delayed almost all feature films that were scheduled for release in the summer of 2020 (which had a domino effect through the rest of the ear). One of those films was Wonder Woman 1984, starring Gal Gadot, which had already been rescheduled months before the pandemic even began. The film was first announced for two different dates in late 2019 (December 13 and then November 1), before being delayed six months to June 5, 2020. The pandemic pushed that date first to August 14, 2020 and then most recently to October 2, 2020. Finally and most recently, Warner Bros announced that Wonder Woman 1984 will now come out theatrically on December 25, 2020, just a week after Dune (also distributed by Warner Bros.) comes out on December 18, 2020. Although there was some speculation that the move was a reaction to the disappointing box office of Tenet, an inside source told Collider that it was not a factor in their decision. Instead, Warner Bros. appears to be reacting to about 35% of the screens in the United States still being closed. Other movies currently scheduled for late December, 2020 include the comedy sequels Coming 2 America and The Croods: A New Age, and Stephen Spielberg’s West Side Story remake. Additionally, the Jordan Peele-produced horror reboot&nbsp;Candyman announced late on Friday afternoon that it will also abandon its October release date (on the 16th, to be specific) and instead opt to open in 2021, though a new date has not been set.3.&nbsp;NEVE CAMPBELL OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED TO RETURN IN&nbsp;SCREAM 5(Photo by Phil Bray/©Dimension Films courtesy Everett Collection)Soon after we learned that the creative team behind last year’s Ready or Not (Certified Fresh at 88%) would be taking on the long-in-development horror sequel&nbsp;Scream 5, one of the first names to be mentioned was Neve Campbell as franchise regular Sidney Prescott. Although both David Arquette and Courteney Cox were also announced earlier this year as returning, both times, Campbell was described as still being in talks, which led some to question whether she would return at all. After all of that trepidation, Spyglass and Paramount did announce yesterday&nbsp;that Neve Campbell is indeed signed to return as Sidney Prescott in Scream 5. Campbell, Cox, and Arquette will be joined by several franchise newcomers, including Melissa Barrera, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Kyle Gallner, Mason Gooding, Mikey Madison, Dylan Minnette, Jenna Ortega, Jack Quaid, and Marley Shelton. Savvy horror fans can probably already start guessing who among the young ensemble cast will be the film’s victims, the new “final girl” (or boy), the Ghostface Killer, and probably one or two red herrings as well. Because, twists.&nbsp;Scream 5 is currently scheduled for release on January 14, 2022.4. ANNE HATHAWAY TO STAR IN PANDEMIC-ERA ROM-COM&nbsp;LOCKDOWN(Photo by Giles Keyte/Focus Features)As the world honors the tragedy of 9/11 on this 19th anniversary, one might remember that it led to a wave of film and TV projects that collectively are now called “post-9/11.” Coincidentally, we are absolutely in the middle of seeing the same thing happening with the COVID-19 pandemic, with the horror film Host (Fresh at 100%) and Michael Bay’s upcoming film Songbird, which was one of the first films to return to production this year. Director Doug Liman made the news earlier this year, as he will be reuniting with his Edge of Tomorrow star Tom Cruise for what promises to be the first feature film actually filmed (partially) in outer space, but&nbsp;before&nbsp;that happens, Liman is now set to direct Anne Hathaway in a low budget (less than $10 million) heist movie/romantic comedy called Lockdown, to start filming in London later this month. No premise has been announced yet, but one has to assume from its title that it&nbsp;probably involves a heist during the pandemic. Just a hunch.5. HARRY STYLES JOINS FLORENCE PUGH IN DON’T WORRY, DARLING(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)It will be a few years (at least) before we ever see the results of this year’s announcement that Booksmart (Certified Fresh at 96%) director Olivia Wilde will be directing a Marvel movie for Sony&nbsp;(speculated to be Spider-Woman), but in the meantime, Wilde is keeping the scope of her second film closer to the real world, or at least a version of the 1950s. Florence Pugh (Midsommar, Black Widow) will star in Don’t Worry, Darling as a 1950s “unhappy housewife who slowly begins to question her own sanity when she starts to notice strange occurrences in her small, utopian community in the California desert.” Her husband was to have been played by Shia LaBeouf, who had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, so her character’s husband will be played by Harry Styles instead. In addition to co-starring in Dunkirk, Styles has been eyeing several roles in the last few years (including Disney’s The Little Mermaid), but it appears that Don’t Worry, Darling will succeed in wooing him. The film’s other co-stars will include Dakota Johnson, Chris Pine, and Wilde herself.6. TIKTOK SENSATION TO STAR IN SHE’S ALL THAT REMAKE(Photo by Miramax)Nowadays, Rachael Leigh Cook mostly stays busy with her Vineyard movies on the Hallmark Channel,&nbsp;but in the 1990s and early 2000s, she was one of the most successful young female movie stars, and one of her most recognized roles came in the 1999 hit She’s All That (Rotten at&nbsp; 41%), co-starring Freddie Prinze Jr. It was basically a Pygmalion or My Fair Lady “ugly duckling” story as a teen rom-com, but that combination proved a successful one. Director Mark Waters (Mean Girls, Freaky Friday) is getting ready to film a gender-reversed remake called He’s All That, and TikTok star Addison Rae Easterling will take on what is basically the female version of Prinze’s character, as she will be attempting to turn one of her nerdy boy classmates into the school’s next prom king. Presumably, the title character will be cast soon, and we can probably expect that some of the parents or teachers will be played by comedy vets (a guess just based on Waters’ other films).7. HAPPY DEATH DAY DIRECTOR RETURNS WITH FREAKY BODY-SWAPPING COMEDY(Photo by Universal Pictures)One of the weird things about title trademarks is that sometimes they can be applied very broadly, while other times, they are pretty specific. For example, although Walt Disney Pictures absolutely owns the Freaky Friday body-swapping franchise (whether it be Hayley Mills or Lindsay Lohan), they don’t own the exclusive rights to the word “Freaky” (or for that matter, “Friday”). So, Universal Pictures and the director of Happy Death Day were able to team up for a body-swapping comedy called Freaky (11/13/2020), which effectively reads as a dark take on Freaky Friday without actually being directly related to it. The twist in Freaky is that instead of mother and daughter, the body swapped pair are a serial killer (Vince Vaughn) and one of his intended victims (Kathryn Newton). The result we seem to see in the first trailer is a serial killer comedy that also sort of brings to mind Rob Schneider’s The Hot Chick.8. A&nbsp;TROOP BEVERLY HILLS SEQUEL IS IN THE WORKS(Photo by Columbia Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)Hollywood loves making sequels to 1980s movies almost as it loves remaking 1980s movies. They do, however, have an inherent problem, as there were only so many movies actually made in the 1980s that are available for sequels or remakes. One has to guess that’s the best possible explanation for the news this week that someone is now actively developing a sequel to the 1989 Shelley Long kids comedy Troop Beverly Hills (Rotten at 25%). Basically, Shelley Long played a rich lady who decides to become the troop leader of a fictionalized Girl-Scouts-But-We-Can’t-Call-Them-Girl-Scouts to show that she is a capable adult. Israeli director Oran Zegman will direct the Troop Beverly Hills sequel from a screenplay by television writer Aeysha Carr (Born Again Virgin, Everybody Hates Chris) and Tamara Chestna, who adapted last year’s After (Rotten at 19%), and speaking of which…9. AFTER SEQUELS ALREADY IN THE WORKS BEFORE SECOND MOVIE EVEN RELEASED(Photo by Quantrell D. Colbert/©Aviron Pictures)One of the most lucrative movie trends of the 2010s decades was the “young adult franchise,” during which every studio did their best to imitate the success of the Harry Potter franchise. Part of the reason why these movies were so profitable was that they could be produced affordably, but that also led to a glut in the marketplace, which possibly combined with audience preference shifts meant that within&nbsp;a decade, the trend was on its last legs. Of course, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t still young adult movies being made (especially on Netflix now), and one such film was last year’s After (Rotten at 19%), based on the 2014 novel that reportedly&nbsp;began as&nbsp;a fan-fiction novel inspired by the music of Harry Styles and One Direction. The sequel After We Collided only just this week got picked up for distribution on PVOD on October 23, 2020, but already the producers are also developing two more sequels: After We Fell and After Ever After. Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin are expected to reprise their roles in all of them.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"child's, YouTube, medical, female, golden, Winners, Film, hidden, TV, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/11164735/Borat_Sequel_Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"a-secret-borat-sequel-has-already-been-filmed-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509171733720","title":"Will Smith to Star in Slavery-Era Thriller Emancipation, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Will Smith to Star in Slavery-Era Thriller Emancipation, and More Movie NewsThe Oscars get postponed, Arthur Ashe gets a biopic, an Animorphs movie is coming, and new films for Oscar Isaac, Kristen Stewart, Tessa Thompson, and Edgar Wright.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 18, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as&nbsp;Animorphs, Attack the Block 2, and new roles for Oscar Isaac, Will Smith, and Kristen Stewart.This WEEK’S TOP STORYWILL SMITH, ANTOINE FUQUA TEAM UP FOR SLAVERY-ERA THRILLER&nbsp;EMANCIPATION(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)In 1863, the still experimental new science of photography gave the world one of its earliest and most shocking demonstrations of the adage that “a picture is worth a thousand words” when an escaped slave named Peter was photographed to reveal his back scarred by countless whip lashes. And now, Peter’s story will be told on the big screen, thanks to Will Smith — who turned down the opportunity to star in Quentin Tarantino’s slavery-era revenge flick&nbsp;Django Unchained —&nbsp;and director Antoine Fuqua, who normally works in the action-thriller genre with movies like&nbsp;Training Day,&nbsp;Olympus Has Fallen, and&nbsp;The Equalizer. Smith will produce and star&nbsp;in the film, called&nbsp;Emancipation, which will be a biographical thriller about the life of the slave named Peter as depicted in that early photograph. Smith and Fuqua expect to start production of Emanciation in early 2021, after Fuqua finishes filming the drama Infinite&nbsp;and after Will Smith wraps filming of King Richard, about the life of Richard Williams, the father of future tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams. The announcement of Emancipation is timely this week as the Juneteenth holiday&nbsp;has its origins in the commemoration of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas on June 19th, 1865.Other Top Headlines1. ACADEMY AWARDS DELAYED TO APRIL OF 2021(Photo by Getty Images)As this year’s COVID-19 pandemic has continued to delay the releases of dozens of films, there has been a steady number of articles wondering online&nbsp;how this year’s shortened release calendar will impact the Academy Awards. The issue at hand was not only that there will be fewer films released in 2020, but also that the later months will be crowded with films originally scheduled for earlier in the year (i.e. when will the “awards season” movies be released?). This week, the mystery was (at least partially) addressed, as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has indeed delayed the 93rd Academy Awards until April 25, 2021 (pushed back two months from Febraury 28, 2021). As part of this delay, the window for eligibility will also be extended&nbsp;all the way to February 28, 2021. This delay potentially will have a particularly strong impact on the Sundance Film Festival, which is annually held in January after the end of awards season, as this new delay means Sundance will now be held a month before the deadline instead of after. (The Berlin and Cannes Film Festivals have already announced that the change will not impact their scheduling.) In (very) related news, the BAFTAs have also delayed their next ceremony until April 11, 2021, just two weeks before the new Academy Awards date.2. EDGAR WRIGHT LINKING UP WITH X-MEN: FIRST CLASS WRITER FOR THE CHAIN(Photo by Wilson Webb/©TriStar)For fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, one of the still mysterious “What If…?” scenarios (not to be confused with the upcoming animated Disney+ series What If…?) involves the version of the first Ant-Man movie that would have been directed by Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead), who eventually dropped out of the production. Well, this week’s news isn’t exactly that, but&nbsp;we did get confirmation&nbsp;of a movie called The Chain&nbsp;that will effectively align Wright with a screenwriter, Jane Goldman, who actually has worked on some Marvel movies (X-Men: First Class, X-Men: Days of Future Past), as well as the non-Marvel comic book adaptation Kingsman: The Golden Circle. Goldman and Wright will deliver the adaptation of Adrian McKinty’s 2019 novel The Chain for Universal Pictures, who picked up the project after it had previously been eyed by Paramount Pictures last summer. The Chain tells the story of a mother of a kidnapped 11-year-old daughter who discovers that the only way to get her own child back is to kidnap somebody’s else child (hence, The Chain). Wright’s next film before The Chain will be Last Night in Soho, starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Jojo Rabbit star Thomasin McKenzie, which is now scheduled for April 23, 2021 after its 2020 release was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.3. JOHN BOYEGA MAY GET HIS ATTACK THE BLOCK SEQUEL AFTER ALL(Photo by Liam Daniel/©Screen Gems courtesy Everett Collection)During a recent protest event, Star Wars&nbsp;star John Boyega wondered aloud, “I don’t know if I’m going to have a career after this,” but several directors and studios were quick to respond online, saying that they would indeed be eager to work with Boyega on future projects. One of those filmmakers appears to have been Joe Cornish (The Kid Who Would Be King), who not only — like Wright above — worked on Marvel’s&nbsp;Ant-Man, but also gave John Boyega one of his earliest leading roles in the 2011 science fiction film Attack the Block (Certified Fresh at 90%). Speaking recently on the Script Apart podcast, Cornish revealed that he has met with Boyega to discuss ideas for an Attack the Block sequel, although he didn’t reveal what&nbsp;it might be about (except that the setting would have to acknowledge the 10+ years since the events of the first movie). Cornish is currently also developing a TV movie adaptation of the cyberpunk novel Snow Crash for HBO Max, and Boyega’s upcoming films include Naked Singularity and Rebel Ridge.4. THIS WEEK IN OSCAR ISAAC NEWS: ARMAGEDDON TIME, LONDON, THE CARD COUNTER(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/Netflix)Speaking of John Boyega, one of his Star Wars co-stars has, like Boyega, had to dedicate&nbsp;much of the last several years to the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;franchise, but that’s all over now, so he’s back to beefing up his other credits. That co-star is Oscar Isaac, and in addition to co-starring in Denis Villeneuve’s highly anticipated upcoming adaptation of&nbsp;Dune (12/28/2020) (which will soon resume filming for reshoots), Isaac will also continue filming his lead role in Paul Schrader’s The Card Counter in Mississippi in early July. On top of that,&nbsp;Isaac also joined two other new projects this week, one of which is&nbsp;Armegeddon Time for director James Gray&nbsp;(Ad Astra, Certified Fresh at 84%), an ensemble drama set at a prestigious private school in the 1980s in which his&nbsp;co-stars will be Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, Donald Sutherland, and Cate Blanchett. Isaac’s other new project is a thriller called London based on a short story by Norwegian author Jo Jo Nesbø&nbsp;and directed by Ben Stiller, which is quite a departure for him. The premise&nbsp;London&nbsp;is being kept under wraps,&nbsp;but it’s adapted&nbsp;by Eric Roth, whose previous films include Forrest Gump, Ali, Munich, the 2018 version of A Star is Born, and soon, the aforementioned remake of Dune.5. KRISTEN STEWART TO STAR AS PRINCESS DIANA SPENCER(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)In Season 3 of Netflix’s The Crown, the cast changed to introduce Olivia Colman as the older Queen Elizabeth and Ben Daniels (Emma.) as a young Prince Charles. Although the new additions also included Emerald Fennell as Camilla Shand, the future Duchess of Cornwall, fans of the show will have to wait until Season 4 to see Emma Corrin join the series as Princess Diana (though you can see some set photos of her in costume here). The Crown will soon have competition, though, in the form of a new feature film about the life of Princess Diana,&nbsp;as Kristen Stewart is now attached to star in the film called Spencer (after Princess Di’s maiden family name). Spencer will be directed by Pablo Larrain, who is probably best known for directing a biographical film about another influential female political figure, Jackie (Certified Fresh at 87%), which starred Natalie Portman as Jacqueline Kennedy in the period immediately after JFK’s assassination. Similarly, Spencer will not be a biopic about Princess Diana’s entire life, but will instead focus on three of the final days of her troubled marriage to Prince Charles. This is not the first time Kristen Stewart has starred in a biopic, as she also played the young Joan Jett in 2010’s The Runaways (Fresh at 70%) and actress-turned-activist Jean Seberg in last year’s Seberg (Rotten at 34%).6. TENNIS STAR ARTHUR ASHE BIOPIC FROM DA 5 BLOODS SCREENWRITER(Photo by Harry Dempster/Getty Images)Decades before Venus and Serena Williams ever picked up a tennis racket, Arthur Ashe made sports history as the first African American man to win a singles title at Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, and the Australian Open, among other accomplishments. Following a heart bypass surgery in the 1980s, Ashe was diagnosed with AIDS, which led to his founding two different health organizations before his death in 1993. A biopic about the life of Arthur Ashe is now in development, to be produced by Hyde Park Entertainment (Blue Valentine, Machete) and Warner Music Group. The film will be adapted by screenwriter Kevin Willmott, who won a Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award for co-writing 2018’s&nbsp;BlackKklansman (Certified Fresh at 96%), and who also wrote 2015’s&nbsp;Chi-Raq&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 82%) and&nbsp;the&nbsp;recent Netflix film&nbsp;Da 5 Bloods (Certified Fresh at 92%), all of which were directed by Spike Lee. Arthur Ashe is survived by his wife, photographer Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, and their daughter Camera, named after her mother’s profession. Warner Music Group is expected to help secure music for the Arthur Ashe biopic from “the extraordinary works of the era by such artists as Aretha Franklin, Prince, Curtis Mayfield, and others.”7. TESSA THOMPSON TO STAR IN TRIPPY THRILLER BALESTRA(Photo by Marvel Studios)In the sport of fencing, a “balestra” is a leap forward usually followed by an aggressive “lunge” attack. Balestra&nbsp;also happens to be a pretty cool-sounding title for a movie, specifically one starring Tessa Thompson, whose profile has risen in recent years thanks to roles in Marvel’s Thor: Ragnarok, HBO’s&nbsp;Westworld, and Boots Riley’s&nbsp;Sorry to Bother You, among other things.&nbsp;Thompson is now executive producing and will star in a psychological thriller called Balestra, playing a “disgraced competitive fencer” hoping for an Olympic comeback who receives a new device designed to help her train while she’s lucid dreaming, until she “gets caught in her own web of subconscious desires and unfulfilling reality.” Balestra will be an independent production directed by Nicole Dorsey (Black Conflux) and will co-star Marwan Kenzari, A.K.A. “Sexy Jafar” from Disney’s recent live-action remake of Aladdin.8. SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE STARS COLIN JOST AND PETE DAVIDSON(Photo by NBC/Getty Images)Staten Island may be the smallest borough of New York City (by population), but it’s also currently the hometown of two current&nbsp;Saturday Night Live cast members, namely Colin Jost and Pete Davidson. Davidson also recently starred in Judd Apatow’s&nbsp;The King of Staten Island (Fresh at 70%), which had its streaming debut last Friday (6/12/2020). Soon, though, Jost and Davidson will have something else in common, as they are now both signed to star in the Universal Pictures comedy Worst Man. As the title suggests, Worst Man will be a wedding-themed comedy about “the family dramatics that ensue just weeks before the wedding,” but it’s currently unclear what roles Jost and Davidson will play — presumably one of them will be the groom, and the other will be the best (worst?) man, and you get no points for guessing which of them is most likely to play which role. Colin Jost’s next movie will be the live-action/CGI hybrid comedy Tom and Jerry (3/5/2021), and Pete Davidson will have a supporting role in next year’s soft reboot of The Suicide Squad (8/6/2021).9. ELIJAH WOOD TO STAR IN TED BUNDY DRAMA NO MAN OF GOD(Photo by Daniel C. McFadden/©IFC Midnight courtesy Everett Collection)In 2012, Lord of the Rings franchise star Elijah Wood played against type by starring as a serial killer in the Maniac remake (Rotten at 53%). For his next film, Wood is stepping around to the other side of the interrogation table, quite literally, as he will star as serial killer Ted Bundy’s FBI analyst Bill Hagmaier in the crime thriller No Man of God, based on the real life transcripts of their conversations from 1984 to 1989. (The real life Bill Hagmaier was also featured in episode 4 of Netflix’s 2019 mini-series Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes). Indie filmmaker Amber Sealey&nbsp;(How to Cheat, No Light and No Land Anywhere) will direct No Man of God from a screenplay by screenwriter C. Robert Cargill (co-writer of Sinister, Sinister 2, and&nbsp;Doctor Strange).10. 1990s NOSTALGIA CONTINUES WITH ANIMORPHS(Photo by Nickelodeon courtesy Everett Collection)Starting in June of 1996, Scholastic started publishing a series of over fifty children’s science fiction novels known as the Animorphs series. Hollywood’s penchant for capitalizing on the nostalgia of decades 20 to 30 years in the past means the 1990s are currently super en vogue. That’s pretty much all you need to know not to be surprised by this week’s news that development has started on an Animorphs movie. As in the books, Animorphs will tell the story of a group of five teenagers with the ability to transform into various animals who then have to use their super powers to prevent a secret alien invasion of Earth. Scholastic Publishing has, to date, published over 35 million copies of Animorphs books, and there was also a Canadian Animorphs TV series in the late 1990s. The Animorphs movie is being developed by producer Erik Feig,&nbsp;whose credits include the Step Up dance franchise, the Wrong Turn horror franchise, and the spy movies Mr. and Mrs. Smith and The Spy Who Dumped Me.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"joker, criterion, dark, Infographic, women, harry, Reviews, Us, Avengers, Searchlight, transformers, Quiz, Winter, Disney, Esquire","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/18175224/Will_Smith_Emancipation_Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"will-smith-to-star-in-slavery-era-thrilleremancipation-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509171754207","title":"Disney Is Developing a Live-Action Hercules Remake, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Disney Is Developing a Live-Action Hercules Remake, and More NewsMajor film festivals unite on YouTube, Transformers gets an animated prequel, the new Space Jam gets a title, and new roles for Peter Dinklage, Josh Brolin, Adam Driver, Karen Gillan, and Daisy Ridley.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 1, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you&nbsp;seven headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Hercules, Space Jam: A New Legacy, and the animated Transformers prequel. &nbsp;This WEEK’S TOP STORYDISNEY IS DEVELOPING A LIVE-ACTION&nbsp;HERCULES REMAKE(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Of the 10 animated features that Walt Disney Pictures released between 1989 and 1999,&nbsp;three have&nbsp;been remade in recent years (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and&nbsp;The Lion King), two are currently waiting to be released or in the works (Mulan and The Little Mermaid), and still one more just&nbsp;entered development last year (The Hunchback of Notre Dame). We’re probably never going to get a live-action Rescuers Down Under, so that only leaves Pocahontas, Tarzan, and Hercules, one of which is now also officially in the works. Walt Disney Pictures is now developing a live-action remake&nbsp;of their 1997 mythological animated musical Hercules (Certified Fresh at 84%), and it will have&nbsp;two direct connections to Marvel Studios in the form of producers Joe and Anthony Russo (the directors of Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame) and screenwriter Dave Callaham, who is currently working on Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (5/7/2021). It is reportedly unclear if the remake will have musical songs from the original, or if it will be a non-musical remake like&nbsp;Mulan, and we don’t yet know who will direct&nbsp;it (although there have been some rumors). Another question left to be addressed is where this puts Marvel’s own version&nbsp;of Hercules, who is one of the earliest members of the Avengers (#11, just before Black Panther and Vision), and one of the longest-running team members as well (his longest stint was in the 1990s). Hercules also has the distinction of being one of the few Marvel Comics characters to receive a popular Internet meme as the “COOL STORY, BRO” guy without also&nbsp;appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Could the Hercules remake end with someone like Nick Fury inviting him to join the New Avengers Initiative?Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;MAJOR FILM FESTIVALS UNITE FOR&nbsp;WE ARE ONE ON YOUTUBEThe COVID-19 pandemic has obviously had an impact on all sectors of society, but some of them didn’t necessarily present obvious alternatives within a “stay-at-home” strategy. For example, yes, movie studios could&nbsp;reschedule their theatrical releases or release some of them on VOD, but the world’s various film festivals are designed to bring people together from across the globe into spaces where they would breathe the same air for two hours in close quarters. So what’s going to happen to the dozens of movies that would have premiered at those festivals in 2020? YouTube and Tribeca Enterprises appear to have found a solution, which will be an event called We Are One: A Global Film Festival&nbsp;that will be presented on YouTube&nbsp;from May 29th to June 7th, 2020. The event will feature programming from 20 major film festivals including Sundance, Berlin, Cannes, New York, Toronto, Tribeca, and Venice. One of the festivals that will not be participating is SXSW, because they are already partnering with Amazon for a separate event now streaming (4/27 to 5/6).2. TRANSFORMERS GETTING ANIMATED PREQUEL FROM TOY STORY 4 DIRECTOR(Photo by De Laurentiis entertainment Group courtesy Everett Collection)Although the 2018 solo Transformers spinoff Bumblebee did very well with critics (Certified Fresh at 91%), the box office numbers were relatively disappointing compared to previous Transformers films. For that reason, Paramount and Hasbro have yet to announce plans for any further solo movies for other Transformers&nbsp;characters, even if they continue to develop other&nbsp;Transformers-related projects. With the latter in mind, one of the new Transformers&nbsp;films Paramount is working on is an animated prequel to be set on their home world of Cybertron. That project is now being developed by director Josh Cooley, who made his feature film debut last summer with Toy Story 4 (Certified Fresh at 97%), which went on to earn over $1 billion at the global box office and win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.3.&nbsp;JOSH BROLIN AND PETER DINKLAGE TO STAR IN TWINS-ESQUE COMEDY BROTHERS(Photo by RCF, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)After starring in several acclaimed indie dramas (notably&nbsp;Blue Ruin, Certified Fresh at 96%), Macon Blair moved on to directing with his debut film, Netflix’s I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore (Certified Fresh at 89%). For his next film, Blair has signed with Legendary Entertainment to direct a Twins-esque high-concept comedy called Brothers. Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in Twins as a pair of “odd couple” brothers, and the brothers in Brothers will be played by two Avengers: Infinity War stars. Those stars will be Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones) and Josh Brolin (Marvel’s Thanos and Cable), but the comedy angle besides them being Brothers isn’t yet known.4. DAISY RIDLEY SHOULD WATCH OUT FOR THE ICE BENEATH HER &nbsp;(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Now that the Star Wars “Skywalker Saga”&nbsp;is officially done, Daisy Ridley is one of the recent franchise stars who has a lot more time on her hands. We’re still awaiting the release of one of those projects, the post-apocalyptic Chaos Walking, and this week, she started negotiations for&nbsp; another. Ridley is now in talks with STXfilms to star&nbsp;in the psychological thriller The Ice Beneath Her, which will be produced and directed by the people behind last year’s Ready or Not (Certified Fresh at 88%). The Ice Beneath Her is an adaptation of a 2015 novel by Swedish author Camilla Grebe which has been compared to both Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train.5. ADAM DRIVER TO STAR AS REVOLUTIONARY LEADER YANKEE COMANDANTE(Photo by Jessica Miglio/©Warner Bros. Pictures)Recent Star Wars star Adam Driver (a.k.a. Kylo Ren) earned his first Academy Award nomination for the 2018 film BlacKkKlansman (Certified Fresh at 96%), which was based on a previously obscure mid-20th century true story. This week, Driver signed on for another similar project, and this time, the true story will send him to the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s.&nbsp;The project is called Yankee Comandante, which is an adaptation of a 2012 article in The New Yorker by reporter David Grann. Grann’s story uncovered the story of a man from Ohio who held the same title of “Comandante” shared by Che Guevara. Yankee Comandante will be directed by Jeff Nichols, whose most recent film was another 20th century true story, Loving (Certified Fresh at 89%).6. KAREN GILLAN AND AARON PAUL TO STAR IN CLONING SCI-FI THRILLER DUAL(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Gregorio T. Binuya/Everett Collection)Karen Gillan has played both a time traveler (Doctor Who), a video game character (Jumanji: The Next Level), an alien (Nebula from Guardians of the Galaxy), and a cyborg (well, that was also Nebula), and soon, it appears she will also be playing a clone (or clones). Gillan, Aaron Paul (TV’s Breaking Bad), and Jesse Eisenberg are all now attached to star in a satirical science fiction thriller called Dual. Riley Stearns (Faults, The Art of Self-Defense) will direct the project about a woman (Gillan) with a deadly condition who decides to be cloned to spare her family their loss, which leads to a conflict when she has a miraculous recovery and survives, forcing her to “duel” her “dual.” Jokes!7. LEBRON JAMES’ HAT REVEALS TITLE OF SPACE JAM: A NEW LEGACY(Photo by © 2020 Warner Bros. Ent. All Rights Reserved)That NBA star LeBron James is producing and will star in a Space Jam (Rotten at 43%) sequel has been known for a while, but until this week, we were all just calling it Space Jam 2. Maybe the delay was in waiting for the hats to come back with the logo, but if so, those boxes apparently came in, because LeBron James took to Twitter to show off a picture of exactly that. James’ branded baseball cap shows off the title as Space Jam: A New Legacy. Sonequa Martin-Green (Star Trek: Discovery) and Don Cheadle (as the villain) will also co-star in Space Jam: A New Legacy, which is currently scheduled for July 16, 2021. As with the first movie (which featured not just Michael Jordan but also Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues, and Patrick Ewing), we can soon expect to hear about other NBA stars joining LeBron James in Space Jam: A New Legacy, which will be directed by Malcolm D. Lee (Girls Trip, The Best Man).8. GINA RODRIGUEZ TO STAR IN STONER COMEDY THE ALIENS ARE STEALING OUR WEED(Photo by John Castillo/Indomina Releasing)One thing that was always odd about Hollywood producing “stoner comedies” like Half-Baked and Up in Smoke is that they were released when prohibition against cannabis was in place in all 50 states (i.e. how easy was it for police to find smokers to arrest when these movies were in theaters?). As several states have lifted or loosened such laws in recent years, one might have expected a rush to make more “stoner comedies,” but thus far, there hasn’t been much of a change. Having said that, this week, Paramount Pictures acquired a spec script called The Aliens Are Stealing Our Weed from screenwriter Ryan Firpo (Marvel’s The Eternals). Gina Rodriguez (TV’s Jane the Virgin) is already attached to star as one of two pot growers who “uncover an alien conspiracy to steal the planet’s marijuana supply.”9. NOW YOU SEE ME SEQUEL PLANS: NOW YOU 3 ME, NOW YOU 4N’T?(Photo by Steve Dietl/©Summit Entertainment courtesy Everett Collection)Although both Now You See Me (Rotten at 50%) and its sequel Now You See Me 2 (Rotten at 34%) received “Rotten” Tomatometer scores, the films had box office numbers over $300 million each, so it always seemed likely that Lionsgate would proceed with sequel plans. It was years ago now that we heard that one of those sequels (or a spinoff) would be China-centric, but it’s also been a while now since we heard about that project. This week, Lionsgate announced that they are now developing a “fresh take” on Now You See Me from screenwriter Eric Warren Singer (The International; co-writer of American Hustle and Top Gun: Maverick). Singer’s screenplay reportedly unites both the “key returning cast” and new characters. Although no actors have officially signed to return for Now You Can See Me 3, some of the possible returning cast could be Sir Michael Caine, Lizzy Caplan, Morgan Freeman, Dave Franco, Isla Fisher, and Zombieland stars Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"the, potter, hard, History, CBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/01162604/Hercules_Live_Action_Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"disney-is-developing-a-live-action-hercules-remake-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509173435621","title":"Bong Joon-ho Might Do a Musical Next, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Bong Joon-ho Might Do a Musical Next, and More Movie NewsFinal Destination gets a sixth installment, Paul Bettany teams up with David Gordon Green, Steven Spielberg wants Vin Diesel to direct, and the \"butthole cut\" of Cats (thankfully?) doesn't exist.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 20, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you&nbsp;seven headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles&nbsp;as&nbsp;Final Destination 6 and the sequel to Spider-Man: Far from Home.This WEEK’S TOP STORYPARASITE DIRECTOR BONG JOON-HO MIGHT DO A MUSICAL NEXT(Photo by Kimberly French/©Netflix)Ever since director Bong Joon-ho’s surprising victories for Parasite at the Academy Awards last month, discussions about what he might direct next have been frequent online. It wasn’t until this week, however, that we got an idea directly from Bong himself, and the surprising answer is, “I would love to make a musical.” Bong continued, “Characters would begin singing, then think, ‘Oh my God, **** this, this is too cheesy,’ and stop suddenly. There are amazing musical films, like Singin’ in the Rain. But when I watch them, I feel very embarrassed and start blushing. So it would have to be… different.” Moving from Parasite to a deconstructed musical wouldn’t be the first time Bong Joon-ho has switched genre gears drastically, as his filmography&nbsp;has also included a monster movie (The Host), post-apocalyptic science fiction (Snowpiercer), and most recently before Parasite, an action adventure about a genetically modified pig (Okja).Other Top Headlines1. TOM HOLLAND HINTS HIS THIRD SPIDER-MAN WILL BE “ABSOLUTELY INSANE”(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/ © Columbia Pictures)The COVID-19 crisis is obviously causing many film productions to be delayed, but for now, the film industry appears to be sticking to existing plans further out. Tom Holland, for example,&nbsp;is apparently still planning to start filming&nbsp;of his third solo movie as Spider-Man&nbsp;in July. Although we don’t yet have an idea of who the villain(s) might be (J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson might be one obvious answer), Holland did describe the third film as “absolutely insane,” and that Zendaya will be returning as MJ. The movie release schedule is very much still in flux, but Sony Pictures currently has the next Spider-Man scheduled for July 16, 2021.2.&nbsp;PAUL BETTANY&nbsp;JOINS DAVID GORDON GREEN’S CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA MOVIE(Photo by Marvel Studios)Although some directors stay rather narrowly within their own personal wheelhouses, others seem quite comfortable with experimenting with a variety of different genres throughout their careers. One example is David Gordon Green, who started with the indie dramas George Washington and All the Real Girls, which then led to the comedies Pineapple Express and Your Highness, and is currently halfway through the horror trilogy of Halloween (Certified Fresh at 79%), Halloween Kills (10/16/2020), and Halloween Ends (10/15/2021). Green will reportedly film Halloween Ends late this year (depending on possible delays), and then move on to an untitled drama about the Cambridge Analytica data mining scandal. Paul Bettany, who later this year will star in the Disney+ series WandaVision, is reportedly now set to star in the project&nbsp;as the company’s CEO Alexander Nix. The lead character of Christopher Wylie is still yet to be cast.3. WHAT STEVEN SPIELBERG REALLY WANTS IS FOR VIN DIESEL TO DIRECT(Photo by Universal Pictures)Many successful actors eventually expand into directing their own films, but Vin Diesel is actually a rare example of a movie star who actually directed a feature film before the roles that made him famous. In 1997, Diesel directed the indie drama Strays, which predates Pitch Black by three years and The Iron Giant by two. This week, while promoting Bloodshot (Rotten at 30%), Diesel talked about a recent conversation he had with Steven Spielberg, who reportedly said to Diesel, “‘When I wrote the role for you in Saving Private Ryan, I was obviously employing the actor, but I was also secretly championing the director in you, and you have not directed enough. That is a crime of cinema and you must get back in the directing chair.’ I haven’t directed enough.” Vin Diesel didn’t give any indication about what sort of movie he might consider directing next.4. JAMIE FOXX TO DIRECT FAITH-BASED DRAMA WHEN WE PRAY(Photo by Warner Bros.)In addition to all of the movies that were recently delayed from release, it’s also worth remembering all of the films that were already in release limbo before&nbsp;the coronavirus outbreak even started. Jamie Foxx made his directorial debut with the basketball comedy All-Star Weekend, which was filmed in late 2018, but going into 2020, All-Star Weekend&nbsp; had not yet secured a distributor in the USA. While the world still waits on his first film, Foxx is now gearing up for his second film as director, which we learned this week will be a faith-based drama called When We Pray. It’s unclear if Foxx will also co-star in&nbsp;the film,&nbsp;which will be about “two brothers who become pastors at different churches in the same community.” The budget of When We Pray is expected to be less than $5 million.5. FINAL DESTINATION 6 DETAILS REVEALED AS&nbsp;ORIGINAL CELEBRATES ITS 20TH ANNIVERSARYIn addition to being St. Patrick’s Day, this Tuesday was sort of dominated by news about the COVID-19 crisis, so even the most avid fans of the Final Destination franchise may have not noticed that the original Final Destination (Rotten at 34%)&nbsp;reached its 20th anniversary on that day. It has also been almost nine years since 2011 release of Final Destination 5 (Fresh at 62%), but screenwriters Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan are now developing a sixth Final Destination project. Producer Craig Perry revealed this week&nbsp;that their current plan for the next Final Destination is “having it take place in the world of first responders: EMTs, firemen and police… These people deal with death on the front lines every day, and make choices that can cause people to live or die.” Most of the earlier films centered around high school or college students, so it sounds like Final Destination 6 might feature older characters.6. CATS FANS DEMAND&nbsp;TO SEE&nbsp;THE&nbsp;“BUTTHOLE CUT”(Photo by Universal Pictures)For a few years now since Justice League (Rotten at 40%) was released in 2017, there has been a&nbsp;#ReleasetheSnyderCut movement asking for Warner Bros. to release the film as it would have been before Joss Whedon filmed reshoots. With that as context, this Tuesday, actor and comedian Seth Rogen live-Tweeted his experience&nbsp;watching Cats&nbsp;while – ahem – under the influence, at the end of which he retweeted screenwriter Jack Waz, who had himself responded to another&nbsp;Cats-related tweet&nbsp;by Ben Mekler by saying that “a VFX producer friend of a friend was hired in November… [whose] entire job was to remove CGI buttholes that had been inserted a few months before. Which means that, somewhere out there, there exists a butthole cut of Cats.” And this is how ridiculous online movements get started. Within hours, #ReleasetheButtholeCut was trending on Twitter, which led Universal Pictures to respond thusly, “Hopefully that will add to the magic and mythical nature of the cinematic treasure.” Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your perspective), Mekler received an email the next morning from an unidentified VFX artist who explained that there were never any buttholes to begin with, but that “there were a dozen or so shots where the skin and fur sim was groomed or just folded in a way that really REALLY looked like very furry lady genitals and buttholes by accident,” and that artists were charged with painting them out. Mekler then put out an open invitation to people who worked on&nbsp;Cats to DM him their best stories, so we may still get a juicy piece of&nbsp;Cats&nbsp;lore out of this after all.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Walt, Mystery, books, history, Series, game, Disney, christmas, child's, historical, Trivia, TLC, Prime, directors","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20170233/Bong_Joon-ho_Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"bong-joon-ho-might-do-a-musical-next-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509173453038","title":"Taika Waititi in Talks to Direct Future Star Wars Movie, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Taika Waititi in Talks to Direct Future Star Wars Movie, and More NewsBad Boys 4 is already in the works, Billie Eilish lands a 007 theme song, Don't Breathe 2 is coming, and Disney makes a big change to the Fox studios it acquired.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 17, 2020 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news (the stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering stories from the last few weeks (due to the holidays) for titles like Bad Boys 4, Don’t Breathe 2, The Flash, and Morbius.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTAIKA WAITITI IN TALKS FOR NEW&nbsp;STAR WARS MOVIE(Photo by Kimberly French/©Fox Searchlight Pictures)Lucasfilm and Disney obviously want to continue making Star Wars movies after Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, but the “who” (and presumably the “what”) has changed repeatedly in just the last couple of years. For example, former plans for Star Wars Story movies like Boba Fett and Obi-Wan were shelved (in favor of shows on Disney+), and there was also a period when Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were developing a future Star Wars trilogy. (It’s still unclear what Rian Johnson’s future with Star Wars might be.) If one wants to find a single clear trend for Star Wars, a strong argument can be made for the influence of Marvel. The hit Disney+ series The Mandalorian was created by Iron Man director Jon Favreau, Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok) directed that show’s season finale, and Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige is also developing a Star Wars movie. We can now add another connection, as Waititi has reportedly been approached by Lucasfilm about developing his own Star Wars movie. Waititi is currently filming his soccer movie Next Goal Wins, and will then move on to Thor: Love and Thunder (11/5/2021), so any Star Wars movie would have to come at some point after those films. For his part, Waititi’s only statement since the news first broke yesterday was this Tweeted image. In related news, Colin Trevorrow’s shelved screenplay for Episode IX titled Star Wars: Duel of the Fates appeared to be leaked online this week, causing a stir among fans who inevitably compared it to J.J. Abrams’&nbsp;The Rise of Skywalker.Other Top Headlines1. BAD BOYS 4 AND NATIONAL TREASURE 3 NOW IN DEVELOPMENT(Photo by Columbia Pictures)It is really quite surprising exactly how often major film trade publications “bury the lede” when reporting on film developments (or, at least, lump two big stories together when they could’ve easily just published them individually). Let’s start with a little bit of history. At one point, Sony Pictures had two Bad Boys sequels on their release schedule: Bad Boys III for 2/17/2017, and Bad Boys IV for July 3, 2019 (so yes, we would’ve already had a 4th movie six months before the actual third movie was released this week.) This week’s Bad Boys for Life currently sports a Fresh Tomatometer with a score of 74%,&nbsp;which is higher than the combined scores of Bad Boys (42%) and Bad Boys II (23%), and it also broke a record with its Thursday night opening box office. All of that put together might be why Sony Pictures has hired Bad Boys for Life co-writer Chris Bremner to star work on a fourth Bad Boys. As for that buried lede, the very last paragraph of that story also reveals that Bremner is currently writing National Treasure 3 for Walt Disney Pictures, presumably with Nicolas Cage returning as well.2.&nbsp;CHRISTIAN BALE TO REUNITE WITH DAVID O. RUSSELL(Photo by Anita Bugge/Getty Images)Like many directors, David O. Russell (Three Kings, Silver Linings Playbook) frequently works with the same actors. There are four Russell has cast three times (Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Jennifer Lawrence, and Mark Wahlberg), and soon, there will be a fifth, as Christian Bale (The Fighter, American Hustle) is now attached to star in a movie with the working title Amsterdam. The premise is being kept relatively secret, except that it reportedly involves an “unlikely partnership between a doctor and a lawyer.” Christian Bale is the first confirmed cast member, but David O. Russell reportedly is considering also casting Jamie Foxx, Angelina Jolie, and Margot Robbie, which would add up to a remarkable star-studded ensemble. In related news, Russell reportedly may also be developing a John D. Rockefeller biopic with Robert De Niro starring, but that news has not been confirmed by a major film industry source yet.3.&nbsp;TRAILER FOR JARED LETO’S MORBIUS&nbsp;HINTS AT MCU CONNECTION(Photo by Sony Pictures Entertainment)Even as Marvel Studios prepares to merge previous Fox/Marvel titles like Fantastic Four and X-Men into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there are some properties like Venom and Spider-Verse that remain at Sony Pictures. When Venom came out last year, it was presumed that it was set in a different “cinematic universe” than the MCU. Who’s set where gets complicated by Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, who has appeared in multiple MCU movies (Avengers: Endgame, etc), and who has been rumored to possibly have a cameo role in Venom 2 (10/2/2020). This week, we got our first trailer for Morbius, in which Jared Leto plays Marvel Comics’ “Living Vampire,” and there were two elements that hinted that Morbius might be set in the same world as Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far from Home. The first was a Spider-Man poster with “Murderer” spray-painted over it (hinting at Far from Home), and the second was the appearance of Michael Keaton, who played Adrian Toomes, a.k.a. the Vulture, in Homecoming. We’ll hopefully know more about all of this when Morbius is released this summer on July 31, 2020.4. THE FLASH OF TWO WORLDS: EZRA MILLER MEETS GRANT GUSTIN(Photo by Clay Enos/©Warner Bros. Pictures, Katie Yu/©The CW Network)One of the most surprising things to happen on The CW’s five-part “Crisis on Infinite Earths” crossover happened in the finale Tuesday night, as we saw Ezra Miller’s movie version of The Flash meet Grant Gustin’s TV show version in “The Speed Force.” Normally, this column doesn’t really touch on TV show news, but this scene potentially has big implications for the long-in-development The Flash (7/1/2022). There have long been indications that The Flash will depict a version of the popular DC Comics storyline Flashpoint, and having Ezra Miller’s version meet Grant Gustin’s version could be part of how we get to Flashpoint, since it involves time travel and alternate realities (much like the CW show as well). There is still a lot about The Flash (the movie) we don’t know, and this might have been just a cute little cameo, but it could also be our first tease about a movie that’s just over two years away from release.5. THE SOUNDS OF NO TIME TO DIE: BILLIE EILISH, HANS ZIMMER, AND THE SMITHS GUITARIST&nbsp;(Photo by Amanda Edwards/Getty Images)One of the last steps in the post-production for most movies (except, apparently, Cats) involves the music. So, one shouldn’t read too much into the stories this week about the music for the 25th James Bond film, No Time to Die (4/10/2020). The biggest revelation is that 18-year-old pop star Billie Eilish will become the youngest person ever to perform the theme song for a James Bond movie. Billie Eilish reportedly wrote the song with her brother Finneas Eilish. It was also confirmed last week that the rest of the score of No Time to Die will be composed by Hans Zimmer, but what’s most surprising is that Zimmer is collaborating with Johnny Marr, who probably remains best known as the guitarist of the influential 1980s British pop group The Smiths.6. STEPHEN LANG’S BLIND KILLER TO RETURN FOR DON’T BREATHE 2(Photo by Ghost House Pictures)It’s impossible to know for sure if any of these movies are related to each other, but in the last few years, there have been a few horror and/or suspense thrillers that are all related to the senses. Sight was the element at play in Lights Out and Bird Box, sound was the sense involved in A Quiet Place, and Don’t Breathe&nbsp;incorporated both.&nbsp;The sequel to&nbsp;A Quiet Place&nbsp;is coming out on March 20&nbsp;of this year, and this week, we learned that the sequel to the latter movie will start filming a month after that. Don’t Breathe director Fede Alvarez has hired his co-writer Rodo Sayagues to make his own directorial debut on Don’t Breathe 2, which is scheduled to start filming in April. Stephen Lang, who starred as “The Blind Man,” the film’s villain, will return for the sequel, which one has to guess will probably be about a new group of victims trapped in his house.7.&nbsp;OSCAR ISAAC MUST REALLY LOVE THE EXPRESSION EX MACHINA(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/Netflix)Just five years ago, Oscar Isaac starred in the science-fiction film Ex Machina, along with Alicia Vikander and Domhnall Gleeson (who went on to co-star with Isaac in the most recent Star Wars trilogy). That movie came out just five years after the final issue of the comic book series also called Ex Machina, which was about the political career of the world’s only superhero who subsequently becomes the mayor of New York City. Earlier this week, it was announced that Legendary Entertainment is developing a movie based on the Ex Machina comic book series that is to be retitled The Great Machine, in an obvious effort to avoid confusion with Ex Machina. Earlier today, we learned exactly why these movies would have been very easily confused, because it turns out that Oscar Isaac is also producing and will star&nbsp;in The Great Machine. So, if the title hadn’t been changed, not only would there be two movies called Ex Machina, but they would have both featured Oscar Isaac.8.&nbsp;KEIRA KNIGHTLEY TO PLAY MOM TO JOJO RABBIT KID STAR IN NEW CHRISTMAS MOVIE(Photo by Barry Wetcher/©Warner Bros.)As Taika Waititi moves on to the soccer movie Next Goal Wins, his Marvel sequel Thor: Love and Thunder, and his future with the Star Wars franchise, the success of his most recently released film continues to have its impact on other film development news. The World War II-set comedy Jojo Rabbit featured three relative newcomers (including Thomasin McKenzie and Archie Yates), but the title role was played by Roman Griffin Davis, who this week joined another movie with a famous actress playing his mom. Keira Knightley and Roman Griffin Davis will play mother and son&nbsp;in an untitled Christmas movie which will focus on how British families celebrate the holiday. The movie will directed by Camille Griffin, who also happens to be Roman’s own real-life mother. The project is now seeking to cast the father of the family.9. DISNEY DROPS THE “FOX” FROM ITS RECENTLY ACQUIRED STUDIOS(Photo by Valerie Macon/Getty Images)It was almost a year ago now that Disney finalized its acquisition of the film and TV properties of 21st Century Fox and Fox Searchlight, but it wasn’t until this week that one of the biggest resulting changes was announced. Disney is removing the word “Fox” from both companies and their logos, so they will now be called just 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures instead. The new name for the studio formerly called 21st Century Fox is particularly curious, as the new name basically spins back the clock&nbsp;as well.Like this?

Since then, Universal has changed course with those characters and franchises, including Paul Feig’s Dark Army project, a possible Monster Mash musical, and the recent reboot of The Invisible Man (Certified Fresh at 91%), starring Elisabeth Moss. The box office opening of $28 million&nbsp;for the latter (from a budget of just $7 million) is seen as a relative success in a period in which other movies like The Call of the Wild and Pixar’s Onward had openings that were perceived as more disappointing. The Invisible Man was produced by Blumhouse Productions&nbsp;(Get Out, The Purge, Insidious, Sinister), and it’s sounding like Universal wants Blumhouse to revive their other classic Universal monsters. Blumhouse and Univeral are now teaming up on a Dracula reboot&nbsp;(which is bad news for Dracula Untold star Luke Evans) to be directed by Karyn Kusama&nbsp;(Destroyer, The Invitation). (Incidentally, the&nbsp;Hollywood Reporter ran a piece this week about how Dracula can be rebooted for the 2020s.) Producer Jason Blum has also been talking up his interest in rebooting Frankenstein recently, though nothing official has been reported on that film yet. In related news, Aquaman director James Wan is now developing a non-Blumhouse project “inspired by Universal’s monster legacy” (however one wants to interpret that).Other Top Headlines1. THE TEAM BEHIND&nbsp;READY OR NOT ARE READY TO SCREAM(Photo by Fox Searchlight Pictures)From 2003 to 2010, Michael Bay’s Platinum Dunes production company began a series of horror movie reboots&nbsp;that would eventually&nbsp;include some of the most iconic franchises,&nbsp;like&nbsp;Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Amityville Horror, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. That eventually led to other horror franchises being rebooted (like Halloween, Child’s Play, and this year’s Candyman), but one that has quietly still been waiting its turn is Scream, the 1996 movie that arguably first succeeded at making horror “meta” in a mainstream way. The Scream reboot (also sometimes called Scream 5) looks like it might finally happen with this week’s news&nbsp;that the project has gone to the team behind last year’s “Hide and Seek” horror film, Ready or Not (Certified Fresh at 88%). The Scream reboot will be directed by the same co-directors from a screenplay by Chad Villella, who executive produced Ready or Not.2. ALL MOVIES FROM THE NEXT THREE WEEKS DELAYED, INCLUDING A QUIET PLACE PART II(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Movie release dates change all the time, but the COVID-19 coronavirus is having such an impact that as of this writing, there are exactly zero movies scheduled for wide release&nbsp;in the next three weeks (3/20, 3/27, and 4/3). After today, the next wide release (unless it also moves)&nbsp;will be&nbsp;Trolls World Tour on April 10. So, how did we get to that huge gap in the schedule? The biggest film to move was A Quiet Place Part II, which was pulled from its release next Friday (3/20/2020)&nbsp;to be rescheduled at a later date. You can read director John Krasinski’s statement about the movie on Twitter right here. Incidentally, this delay came soon after John Krasinski revealed that he already has ideas for A Quiet Place Part III, so he might now have more time to work on that third film. Paramount also pulled The Lovebirds from April 3rd, and STXfilms moved My Spy (after many other release date shifts) from today to April 17th. The Jackass­-style comedy Bad Trip was also pushed back from April 10th to April 17th. One movie that was pushed back out of this range that actually does have a release date now is Peter Rabbit 2: The Runway, which got moved from its Easter-friendly April 3rd release date to August 7, 2020 (it’s not like Peter Rabbit is the “Easter Bunny,” though many make that mistake).3. DISNEY POSTPONES&nbsp;MULAN, THE NEW MUTANTS, AND HORROR FILM ANTLERS(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)One of the films that was arguably hardest hit by delays caused by Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox last year was the Marvel Comics movie The New Mutants, which was originally scheduled for release on April 13, 2018. The long wait for The New Mutants seemed to finally be over as we entered this week, and Disney continued to promote the film’s April 3, 2020 release, including this nifty teaser that shows off Magik as played by Anya Taylor-Joy (Emma, The Witch). The beginning of promotion for The New Mutants also included director Josh Boone revealing that the sequel would have been called&nbsp;New Mutants: Brazil&nbsp;and would have introduced Antonio Banderas as Sunspot’s dad. That was, unfortunately, soon followed by more bad news for The New Mutants, yet again, as Disney has pulled three films from their March and April release dates: Mulan (was 3/27/2020), The New Mutants (was 4/3/2020), and Antlers (was 4/17/2020). Disney said in a statement that, “We truly believe in the moviegoing experience, and we are looking at new potential 2020 release dates to be announced at a later date.”4. DISNEY CASTS&nbsp;ITS&nbsp;PETER PAN &amp; WENDY(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)As you’ll read below, filming on several Disney projects has been suspended, and one of them was&nbsp;Peter Pan &amp; Wendy, Disney’s live-action remake of the 1953 animated classic Peter Pan. That was actually the second time that Peter Pan &amp; Wendy made the news this week, because just two days earlier, Disney announced who was playing the two leads. The role of Peter went to&nbsp;12-year-old relative newcomer Alexander Molony, who to date has mostly appeared in TV shows like Claude and The Reluctant Landlord. The role of Wendy will be played by Ever Anderson, who, by birth, has perhaps a little more inherent fame, because her parents are actress Milla Jovovich and&nbsp;director Paul W.S. Anderson, who frequently directs Jovovich&nbsp;in video game adaptations like the Resident Evil franchise and the upcoming Monster Hunter (9/4/2020). Ever Anderson made her film debut playing a younger version of her mom (and the Red Queen) in Resident Evil: The Final Chapter.5. F9 PUSHED BACK TO THE 2021 DATE WHEN F10 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RELEASED(Photo by Universal Pictures)So far, most of the delays related to coronavirus concerns seem to be just for the next month or two, but&nbsp;some studios are reacting with much longer delays. The biggest came from Universal Pictures, which pulled F9 (the ninth Fast &amp; Furious movie) from its 5/22/2020 release date, and pushed it all the way back to April 2, 2021. The curious thing about that particular date is that it was previously the release date for the next movie in the franchise, F10, which is presumably now delayed to late 2021 or even 2022 instead. The status of the production and release of F10 wasn’t really addressed in Universal’s statement this week (though it’s worth noting that Vin Diesel has talked about the final film actually being split into two parts&nbsp;).6. DISNEY DELAYS FILMING OF THE LITTLE MERMAID, SHANG-CHI, AND MANY MORE(Photo by Walt Disney courtesy Everett Collection)While several films have seen their imminent release dates shift over the past few days,&nbsp;there are still others that would have been currently filmed for late 2020 or 2021, and they’re also being delayed for similar reasons. One major project that has stopped filming temporarily&nbsp;is Marvel Studios’ Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2/12/2021), because its director Destin Daniel Cretton has chosen to self-quarantine himself. That news was followed mere hours later by the announcement that Walt Disney Pictures had halted production of several film and TV projects, including the live-action remakes of The Little Mermaid (just nine days before filming was to start in London) and Peter Pan and Wendy, as well as Guillermo del Toro’s Nightmare Alley and Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel. Other studios are also halting production on some of their projects, including Universal Pictures’ romantic comedy&nbsp;Bros (starring Billy Eichner) and Sony Pictures’ The Nightingale (12/25/2020), starring Dakota and Elle Fanning, not to be confused with the 2019 film that shares the same title.7. TOM HANKS TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 WHILE FILMING BAZ LUHRMANN’S ELVIS PRESLEY BIOPIC(Photo by Sony Pictures)There were dozens of stories this week about the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus on Hollywood and its movies, but there was one story that definitively resonated across social media. Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson have been in Australia&nbsp;to film Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis Presley biopic (10/1/2021), in which Hanks plays “Colonel” Tom Parker. It was&nbsp;there where Hanks and Wilson announced to the world&nbsp;that they have tested positive for COVID-19 (their statement is worth reading if just to learn their symptoms). Meanwhile, production in Australia on the Elvis Presley biopic is temporarily halted, as many other productions have done this week. Hanks’ son, Colin Hanks, also took to Twitter soon after to give fans an update about their&nbsp;conditions.8. WOODY HARRELSON REPLACES JASON STATHAM AS THE MAN FROM TORONTO(Photo by Glen Wilson/©Columbia Pictures)It can be sort of fascinating to delve into casting stories over time and take note of which actors almost landed certain roles&nbsp;that were ultimately made famous by someone else. Just last week, we reported that&nbsp;Jason Statham had dropped out of the Kevin Hart action comedy The Man from Toronto, and now a week later, we can also reveal who someone in Hollywood thought was comparable enough to Jason Statham to be his replacement. The answer turns out to be a former sitcom star from Texas — which is quite different from an English action star —&nbsp;namely Woody Harrelson (Zombieland, Venom 2, The Hunger Games), who has signed a deal to star&nbsp;in The Man from Toronto opposite Kevin Hart. Sony Pictures has scheduled The Man from Toronto for release on November 20, 2020 (up against the monster movie Godzilla vs Kong), and the week before the James Bond movie No Time to Die.9. VIN DIESEL CONFIRMS SEQUEL PLANS FOR THE LAST WITCH HUNTER(Photo by Scott Garfield/©Summit Entertainment)Vin Diesel has become synonymous with his most successful franchise, the Fast &amp; Furious movies, even if he’s got plenty of other movies on his résumé (like this week’s Bloodshot, Rotten at 35%, or as the voice of Groot in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies). Perhaps looking for another possible franchise (especially with Fast &amp; Furious 10 expected to be the last in that run), Diesel is now talking about plans for a sequel&nbsp;to the 2015 fantasy action adventure The Last Witch Hunter (Rotten at 17%). It’s understandable if you can’t remember that The Last Witch Hunter was even a movie (people will probably eventually feel the same way about Bloodshot), as it only earned $27 million domestically. Nevertheless, Vin Diesel confirmed that Lionsgate has hired a writer&nbsp;for the sequel (though he doesn’t drop their name), and that he’s sometimes approached by fans who want to see him and Michael Caine return for a sequel.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Christmas, Pirates, Red, MSNBC, hidden","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/13161650/Dracula_Reboot_Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"blumhouse-eyes-dracula-and-frankenstein-reboots-next-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509175073015","title":"Nicolas Cage in Talks to Star as Himself in a New Meta Drama, And More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Nicolas Cage in Talks to Star as Himself in a New Meta Drama, And More Movie NewsDwayne Johnson's Black Adam gets a release date, Rin Tin Tin gets rebooted, Beverly Hills Cop 4 goes to Netflix, and Mark Wahlberg joins Uncharted.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 15, 2019 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news (the stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering&nbsp;titles like Black Adam, The Little Mermaid, Rin Tin Tin, and Uncharted.This WEEK’S TOP STORYNICOLAS CAGE TO PLAY NICOLAS CAGE IN MOVIE ABOUT NICOLAS CAGE(Photo by NurPhoto/Getty Images)Just a couple of weeks ago,&nbsp;Ocbtober 29 marked the 20th anniversary of the release of Being John Malkovich (Certified Fresh at 93%), a movie that was “meta” before that word was even in common parlance. Given how well&nbsp;it&nbsp;was received, it’s a little surprising more films like it (Jean-Claude Van Damme’s&nbsp;JCVD, for example) haven’t been made, but we may finally get the mother of all meta films in the near future. After a surprisingly active auction, Lionsgate has won the rights to a “meta drama” called The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, about a famous Hollywood actor named Nicolas Cage. Lionsgate is now in talks with a famous Hollywood actor named Nicolas Cage to take on the role, who is described as being the star of Face/Off, Con Air, Mandy, Color Out of Space, and the upcoming Lionsgate “meta drama” The Unberable Weight of Massive Talent. Specifically, Cage will play a version of himself who is trying to get a role in Quentin Tarantino’s next film and who “also occasionally talks to an egotistical 1990s version of himself who rides him for making too many crappy movies and for not being a star anymore.” It is not yet known if Quentin Tarantino will cast Nicolas Cage in his next movie. Nicolas Cage will also reprise his caveman role in The Croods 2 (12/23/2020), and might return as the voice of Spider-Man Noir in Spider-Verse 2 (4/8/2022).Other Top Headlines1. BOOGIE NIGHTS DIRECTOR RETURNING TO 1970s SAN FERNANDO VALLEY(Photo by Laurie Sparham /© Focus Features)Back&nbsp;in 1997, New Line Cinema released Boogie Nights (Certified Fresh at 93%), the second film from writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, who went on to work on such movies as Magnolia (Certified Fresh at 83%), Punch-Drunk Love (Certified Fresh at 80%), There Will Be Blood (Certified Fresh at 91%), and last year’s Phantom Thread (Certified Fresh at 91%). Put another way, P.T. Anderson’s films have only ever scored a Tomatometer below 83% once (73% for Inherent Vice). For his next film, Anderson appears to be returning to his roots with a project that bears similiarities to both Boogie Nights and Magnolia. Described as an ensemble piece, the untitled project will reportedly be set in the San Fernando Valley in the 1970s and focus on “a high school student who is also a successful child actor.” Filming is expected to start in February, so we should start hearing casting announcements soon.2.&nbsp;MOON KNIGHT, MS. MARVEL, AND SHE-HULK ALL HEADING TO MARVEL MOVIES AFTER DISNEY+(Photo by Disney XD/Getty Images)The new Disney+ app launched this week, but we won’t see the first Marvel Studios series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, until late next year.&nbsp;Like that series, the first batch of&nbsp;Marvel shows on Disney+ are mostly going to feature MCU characters who first appeared in the movies (WandaVision, Loki, Hawkeye), but the next batch announced after those shows are for three characters that will make their debuts on Disney+: Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, and She-Hulk. This week, Kevin Feige confirmed that all three of those characters will go on to appear in Marvel Studios movies after first making their debuts in their Disney+ shows. Feige didn’t specify which movies they’ll appear in, but Ms. Marvel seems likely to co-star in the inevitable Captain Marvel&nbsp;sequel.&nbsp;As for where the other two might show up, She-Hulk was a long-time member of the Fantastic Four in the comics (as well as the female-centric A-Force), and Moon Knight has been a member of both West Coast Avengers and Secret Avengers (if either of those teams are likely to ever get their own movies). You can read more about the Disney+ shows for Moon Knight here&nbsp;and She-Hulk here.3. DWAYNE JOHNSON’S SHAZAM SPINOFF BLACK ADAM SCHEDULED FOR 2021(Photo by Ron Phillips/©Warner Bros. Pictures)Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is such a looming presence on next month’s schedule that pretty much no other major franchise entry is daring to take it on (the closest we’ll get is Jumani: The Next Level). Likewise, Disney has already claimed December of 2022 for their next mystery Star Wars movie, but that leaves December in both 2020 and 2021 relatively wide open. Disney’s own entry for December, 2021 is James Cameron’s Avatar 2 (12/17/2021), but that film’s juggernaut potential is definitely not a sure thing. Warner Bros. ended up raking in over $1.14 billion from their December 2018 release Aquaman, so they’ve scheduled another DC Comics movie for December, 2021. That movie is Black Adam, the long-in-development anti-hero project starring Dwayne Johnson, who has been in talks to play&nbsp;the character&nbsp;since 2007. Black Adam is now scheduled for December 22, 2021, up against Sherlock Holmes 3, the Wicked movie, and an untitled Disney movie (possibly one of their live-action remakes). The news also came along with our first Black Adam poster, which is basically costume concept art. Paramount Pictures also made a big announcement for December, 2021 this week, as they have come aboard Babylon, the next film from director Damien Chazelle (La La Land, Whiplash), a 1920s-set Hollywood thriller starring Brad Pitt and Emma Stone. Paramount is scheduling Babylon for an awards season-friendly platform release starting on Christmas Day, 2021 before opening wide two weeks later on January 7, 2022.4. RELATIVE UNKNOWN LANDS PRINCE ERIC ROLE IN THE LITTLE MERMAID REMAKE(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Walt Disney Pictures’ first choice to play Prince Eric in their upcoming live-action remake of The Little Mermaid was pop star Harry Styles of One Direction.&nbsp;Unfortunately, Harry Styles ultimately turned down the role, and it’s been two months now since Disney had to find a new Eric. Surprisingly, the studio has decided to go with a relatively unknown young actor&nbsp;named Jonah Hauer-King, whose biggest movie to date was this year’s doggie sequel A Dog’s Way Home. With the last of the remake’s major roles finally cast, director Rob Marshall (Chicago, Mary Poppins Returns) is expected to start filming in early 2020, possibly aiming for a release date in late 2021 or sometime in 2022. Jonah Hauer-King’s co-stars in The Little Mermaid will include Awkwafina (Scuttle), Javier Bardem (King Triton), Daveed Diggs (Sebastian), Melissa McCarthy (Ursula), Jacob Tremblay (Flounder), and Halle Bailey as Ariel,&nbsp;The Little Mermaid herself.5. CANINE SUPERSTAR RIN TIN TIN TO BE REBOOTED 75+ YEARS AFTER HIS LAST MOVIEAccording to Hollywood legend, the German Shepherd movie star Rin Tin Tin&nbsp;was so famous that his 27 movies were enough to save the fledgling Warner Bros. studio from failure. Despite that, most movie fans today probably don’t even know who Rin Tin Tin is, partly because Warner Bros. has left the title alone for most of the last sixty years (the Rin Tin Tin TV show went off the air in 1959). Movies about dogs are as popular now as ever, which might be why it’s finally time for Warner Bros. to revive Rin Tin Tin for a new generation of audiences.&nbsp;The studio has begun development on a new Rin Tin Tin movie project by hiring screenwriter Matt Lieberman, who is coming off the recent success of The Addams Family. Warner Bros. executives were reportedly inspired to revive&nbsp;the character&nbsp;by the true story of the military dog who assisted in the assassination of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last month.6. EDDIE MURPHY’S LONG-DELAYED BEVERLY HILLS COP 4 MOVES TO NETFLIX(Photo by © Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)Though movies like&nbsp;Joker can earn over $1 billion, the marketplace for middle-tier movies is becoming narrower and less profitable. We’ve already seen in recent years entire genres like romantic comedies dwindle down to just two or three movies a year (like Last Christmas and Isn’t It Romantic in 2019). Meanwhile, the exploding streaming landscape is thirsty for content. One project that has been floating in and out of development for much of the last 25 years is Beverly Hills Cop 4, the sequel that would bring back Eddie Murphy’s Axel Foley character for the first time since 1994’s Beverly Hills Cop III (Rotten at just 10%). Paramount Pictures has finally found a solution to their&nbsp;dilemma by selling the rights to the sequel to Netflix, which recently had success with Eddie Murphy’s Dolemite is My Name. The somewhat ironic backstory to this move, however, is that it is happening even as Eddie Murphy is also filming another long-in-development comedy sequel, Coming 2 America, which remains scheduled for release on December 18, 2020.7. MARK WAHLBERG JOINS TOM HOLLAND IN&nbsp;UNCHARTED(Photo by Patti Perret/Paramount Pictures)If you’ve ever played one of the popular Uncharted video games, you probably remember Sully, the older supporting character to&nbsp;main protagonist&nbsp;Nathan Drake. Tom Holland has been attached to star as Drake in the Uncharted movie for a while now, but until this week, we hadn’t heard much about who would co-star as Sully. Given that Tom Holland, who’s currently 23, looks a lot younger than Nathan Drake does in the games, it makes sense that Sully will also be cast younger, and that’s exactly what’s happening, because the role has gone to Mark Wahlberg (who’s currently 48). The other rather fascinating thing about Wahlberg taking this role is that years ago, when Uncharted first started its route to becoming a movie,&nbsp;he&nbsp;himself had actually been in talks to star as Nathan Drake, although presumably, that was before the character was de-aged to fit Tom Holland. After being bumped around the calendar in recent years, the Uncharted movie is now scheduled for release on December 18, 2020, up against Coming 2 America&nbsp;and the remakes of Dune and West Side Story.8. RUG PULLED ON RUGRATS REBOOT(Photo by Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)In the same week that we saw the first trailers for Scoob! (rebooting Scooby-Doo), the visual reworking of Sonic the Hedgehog, and the first CGI SpongeBob SquarePants movie, another animated reboot was pulled from its planned release date. Until this week, Paramount and Nickeoldeon had been working on a reboot of Rugrats for a release date of January 29, 2021, but that date will now instead go to another animated movie called Rumble. That film sounds a bit like Space Jam, but for professional wrestling, as it is set in a world where actual monsters compete as professional wrestlers.9.&nbsp;BOX OFFICE FAILURE OF DOCTOR SLEEP LEADS TO HALLORAN CANCELLATION(Photo by © Warner Bros.)Up until last weekend, the idea of a sequel to Stephen King’s The Shining in the form of Doctor Sleep seemed like a fairly reasonable proposition (especially when you look at the box office successes of the two IT movies, for example). Instead, Doctor Sleep opened to just $14 million, which was low enough to give the weekend’s #1 spot to the World War II remake Midway (also a disappointment). Very frequently, movie studios like Warner Bros. will start development on sequels to future films before the first movie is even released in an effort to narrow the turnaround time in between the two movies. So, unsurprsingly, we learned this week that Warner Bros. had started developing a movie called Halloran. Based on that title, we can presume that Halloran would have somehow focused on the character played by Scatman Crothers in The Shining and Carl Lumbly in Doctor Sleep, either as a prequel, a sequel (with the character as a ghost), or perhaps both. Unfortunately, it’s sounding like Halloran will probably be permanently scrapped now, but since we also live in a streaming world, it could perhaps end up on Warner Bros.’ upcoming HBO Max service.Like this?

Since then, Marvel has also announced a release date of May 6, 2022 for&nbsp;Black Panther 2, but today’s late-breaking news is painting an image of 2022 that promises an ambitious slate comparable to that of 2019. Sony Pictures has confirmed plans for a second animated movie starring the Miles Morales version of the web-crawler as seen in last year’s Academy Award winning&nbsp;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The&nbsp;Spider-Verse&nbsp;sequel is now scheduled for April 8, 2022, just shy of a month before&nbsp;Black Panther 2&nbsp;on May 6, 2022. Although they’re not yet dated, the other Marvel movies that could potentially be scheduled for 2022 are the&nbsp;Blade&nbsp;reboot starring Mahershala Ali and the&nbsp;Fantastic Four&nbsp;movie mentioned at San Diego Comic-Con, which would finally bring Stan Lee’s original Marvel super team into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. On top of that, today’s announcement that director Peyton Reed is returning for&nbsp;Ant-Man 3 could mean that movie is also a candidate to appear on Marvel’s slate for 2022.&nbsp;As for what we might see in&nbsp;Spider-Verse 2, the final scenes of the first movie did hint at both&nbsp;Spider-Man 2099&nbsp;and the finger-pointing&nbsp;Spider-Man ’67.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Top Headlines1. GAME OF THRONES SHOWRUNNERS DEPART STAR WARS(Photo by Steve Granitz/Getty Images)A week full of Game of Thrones&nbsp;news actually got started with movie news tangentially related to HBO’s hit series. One of the biggest stories of 2018 had been the announcement in February of that Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were developing a new trilogy of Star Wars movies (at the time thought to possibly be in the Knights of the Old Republic video game setting). The announcement was warmly received by fans, but that was also over a year before those fans (and critics) actually saw the final season&nbsp;of Game of Thrones. Citing an interest in focusing on their new deal with Netflix, Benioff and Weiss this week departed their planned Star Wars trilogy. Many writers are interpreting their departure as fitting a Lucasfilm narrative that also included the previous departures from other Star Wars projects by Josh Trank (Boba Fett: A Star Wars Story), Colin Trevorrow (Star Wars Episode IX), and the team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Solo: A Star Wars Story). One thing we also heard this week is that Benioff and Weiss’ trilogy may have pre-dated Knights of the Old Republic entirely, instead telling the origin stories for Jedi Knights themselves. Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Pictures reportedly are still planning on releasing a Star Wars movie in December of 2022&nbsp;but it’s not yet known what it will be.2.&nbsp;LADY GAGA TO PORTRAY GUCCI WIDOW IN FIRST&nbsp;ROLE&nbsp;POST-A STAR IS BORN(Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/Getty Images)Very often, after movies like last year’s A Star is Born attains the level of that film’s box office and critical acclaim, the film’s perceived “breakout star” tends to land a new movie (if not several) fairly quickly.&nbsp;That said, we didn’t hear about a new movie for Lady Gaga until this week, as she is now attached to star in an untitled film to be directed by Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner, Alien) about the 1995 assassination of Maurizio Gucci, the grandson of fashion icon Guccio Gucci. Lady Gaga will star as Patrizia Reggiani, the ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci who in 1998 was convicted of conspiring in his murder. Ridley Scott’s wife Giannina Facio Scott is producing the film, which will be adapted from the book, The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed.&nbsp;Scott’s next film is still expected to be&nbsp;The Last Duel, a historical drama starring Matt Damon, Adam Driver, and Ben Affleck.3. DISCO KINGS BEE GEES LEGACY STAYIN’ ALIVE WITH THEIR OWN MUSICAL MOVIE(Photo by Steve Schapiro/Getty Images)After last year’s Queen musical biopic Bohemian Rhapsody tremendously overperformed with a global box office total of over $900 million, Hollywood went all-in on musical biopics. Producer Graham King, who was one of those behind Bohemian Rhapsody, is now teaming up with Paramount Pictures to develop a similar film about the careers and lives of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb, also known as the Bee Gees. The involvement of Paramount Pictures is especially of interest here because Paramount was the studio behind the 1977 film Saturday Night Fever, the disco-era movie&nbsp;that featured some of the Bee Gees’ biggest hits. Paramount has purchased the life rights to the entire Gibb family estate (presumably including fourth brother Andy Gibb), and will be able to use all of their classic songs in the film.4.&nbsp;OSCAR ISAAC TO STAR IN PAUL SCHRADER’S LATEST AS THE CARD COUNTER(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/Netflix)Following a few films that were not so well received, director (and Taxi Driver screenwriter) Paul Schrader arguably had something of a comeback hit last year with First Reformed, the critically acclaimed religious drama starring Ethan Hawke. Next up, Schrader will be teaming up with Oscar Isaac for a gambling drama called The Card Counter, in which Isaac will play a professional gambler who attempts to “reform a young man seeking revenge on a mutual enemy from their past.” Isaac wasn’t the only Star Wars: The Last Jedi star to get a new role this week, though, as Kelly Marie Tran (“Rose”) also joined the voice cast of The Croods 2 (12/23/2020) as the third new star in the sequel after the previously announced Peter Dinklage and Leslie Mann.5. ANDREW GARFIELD JOINS LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA’S TICK, TICK… BOOM!(Photo by Merrick Morton/©Columbia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)The world is still waiting on any indication that we will ever get a Hamilton&nbsp;movie, but its creator Lin-Manuel Miranda is definitely staying busy with other projects. The long-in-development movie version of Miranda’s musical play In the Heights is coming out next summer (6/26/2020), and Miranda is also co-starring in HBO’s His Dark Materials soon. Amidst all of these projects and developments, one landmark that Lin-Manuel Miranda has not yet had is his own directorial debut, but that’s going to happen soon with a high profile Netflix project based on the Off-Broadway play tick, tick… BOOM! The autobiographical play was written by Jonathan Larson, the creator of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play Rent. The lead role will be portrayed by Andrew Garfield, who, despite starring in a number of acclaimed projects from&nbsp;The Social Network to Martin Scorsese’s&nbsp;Silence, is probably still best known as the star of the two Amazing Spider-Man movies that came out between Tobey Maguire’s and Tom Holland’s stints as the character.6.&nbsp;BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH, JODIE FOSTER, AND SHAILENE WOODLEY TO CO-STAR IN PRISONER 760(Photo by Jason Smith, Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)The American Film Market is about to start in Santa Monica this coming Wednesday, which means that we’re starting to hear about new star-driven movies that will be sold to the various movers and shakers at AFM. One such project, co-produced by the BBC, is a drama called Prisoner 760, which will star French actor Tahar Rahim as Mohamedou Oul Slahi, a Mauritanian who found himself detained at Guantánamo Bay for over 14 years. Rahim will be supported in Prisoner 760 by Benedict Cumberbatch (as a military prosecutor), and both Jodie Foster and Shailene Woodley as his defense legal team. Prisoner 760 will be directed by Kevin MacDonald, who won an Academy Award for the documentary One Day in September, and who was also BAFTA-nominated for Touching the Void, The Last King of Scotland, and the documentary Marley.7. DISNEY REMAKING A CHRISTMAS CAROL AS A NEW MUSICAL CALLED MARLEY(Photo by ©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)Speaking of Marley,, which was a biographical documentary about the famed reggae star, we learned this week that there will be a new musical also called&nbsp;Marley (although the similarities almost certainly end right there). Instead, this Marley will be a new interpretation of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol by Walt Disney Pictures with a new focus on Ebenezer Scrooge’s deceased business partner Jacob Marley. It’s not yet known if that means we’ll be getting a prequel when Marley was still alive, or if this will maybe be a musical set in the afterlife, like say, Beetlejuice (although the latter does seem more likely,&nbsp;based on reports this week). Marley will continue the relationship between Walt Disney Pictures and director Bill Condon, whose 2017 live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;earned over $1.263 billion worldwide for the studio (making it the #2 movie of 2017, just after Star Wars: The Last Jedi).8. RACHEL WEISZ TO STAR AS ELIZABETH TAYLOR IN A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP(Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images)Unlike many other actresses of her stature, Rachel Weisz has for the most part in her career avoided portraying “famous people” (unlike, say, Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, etc.). That is about to change in a very big way, however, as Weisz is now signed to star as one of the most recognizable Hollywood movie stars ever — namely Elizabeth Taylor — in A Special Relationship. Not to be confused with 2010’s The Special Relationship (about Tony Blair and Bill Clinton), A Special Relationship will tell the true story of Elizabeth Taylor’s long friendship with her openly gay personal assistant, Roger Wall (that role hasn’t been cast yet). The choice of title is an interesting one, because at first glance, one might presume it refers to one of Taylor’s many famous marriages, but it doesn’t.9. CONJURING WRITERS TO START A NEW HORROR FRANCHISE WITH LALAURIE MANSION(Photo by Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images)One of the hooks that has helped The Conjuring, its sequels, its spinoffs, and their sequels become a new horror cinematic universe is that all of their stories are somewhat rooted in the “real world,” being that&nbsp;paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren were themselves real people. In pursuit of the next big thing in similar horror stories based on true stories, Chad and Carey Hayes, who wrote The Conjuring and some of its sequels, are now developing a new “haunted house” horror franchise&nbsp;based on the events reported to have taken place at the LaLaurie Mansion in New Orleans, which has been closed off to the public since 1932. The origins of the spooky stories begin with real life 19th century serial killer Delphine LaLaurie, who inspired the character played by Kathy Bates in American Horror Story: Coven.Like this?

Binuya/Everett Collection)Going into this week, the only actor that we had heard was in talks to play a villain in The Batman (6/25/2021) was Jonah Hill. Now we have two people confirmed, and none of their names’ is Jonah. Zoe Kravitz is&nbsp;Catwoman.&nbsp;On Thursday, the news broke that Hill had dropped out of talks to play a Batman villain, potentially because Hill had asked for $10 million, twice what Warner Bros. was paying Robert Pattinson to be&nbsp;Batsy. Whatever his role was, The Riddler is now on the scene, who has signed on Paul Dano.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the search is still on for&nbsp;the third villain:&nbsp;Penguin. In related news, Robert Pattinson also made a surprising revelation this week, saying that his version&nbsp;of The Batman is “not a hero.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Top Headlines1. MATRIX 4:&nbsp;NEIL PATRICK HARRIS IN, JADA PINKETT-SMITH IN TALKS(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)Last week, we learned that Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Black Manta from Aquaman) had been cast in a new lead role (AKA not Morpheus, etc.). And this week, we heard about two other possible new additions, plus a returning cast member from the two sequels. Let’s start with Jada Pinkett Smith, who is now in talks with Warner Bros to reprise&nbsp;her character Niobe,&nbsp;the ship captain.&nbsp;Jada Pinkett Smith’s recent roles have included Bad Moms, Girls Trip, and this summer’s Angel Has Fallen. One of the new characters will be played by&nbsp;Neil Patrick Harris;&nbsp;various guesses online include a “Mr.” agent, the adult Spoonboy, or a younger version of The Architect. The third name in play this week&nbsp;is Jessica Henwick, who is probably best known for playing&nbsp;Colleen Wing in Netflix-Marvel’s Iron Fist series.&nbsp;2.&nbsp;ROBERT EGGERS’&nbsp;VIKING EPIC&nbsp;THE NORTHMAN ATTRACTS THE WITCH AND THE LIGHTHOUSE&nbsp;ALUM(Photo by A24/courtesy Everett Collection)This month’s spooky&nbsp;black-and-white&nbsp;drama&nbsp;The Lighthouse is only director Robert Eggers’ second feature film (after 2015’s The Witch), but already the guy appears to be developing his own regular cast of actors. Eggers’ next film will be a Viking revenge film set in 10th century Iceland, and stars both previous and new to his troupe have been announced. Let’s start with the new:&nbsp;Nicole Kidman and brothers Alexander and&nbsp;Bill Skarsgård. The previous:&nbsp;Anya Taylor-Joy and Willem Dafoe. In related news, Willem Dafoe also this week officially joined&nbsp;Guillermo del Toro’s Nightmare Alley remake.&nbsp;3. GAL GADOT TO PRODUCE AND STAR IN WORLD WAR II POLISH UNDERGROUND BIOPIC(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)It has long been a Hollywood tradition that when movie stars get to a certain status, the opportunity opens up for them to guide their own careersand potentially, those of others) through their own production company. Gal Gadot, whose next major film will be next summer’s Wonder Woman 1984, has formed a company with her husband Jaron Varsano called Pilot Wave. The first announced film&nbsp;for the new company&nbsp;will be Irena Sendler, a historical thriller about the life of Polish Underground leader, whom Gal Gadot will also portray. Sendler’s organization worked in the Warsaw ghetto of World War II to save over 2,500 Jewish children, among other anti-Nazi efforts.4. JOHN KRASINSKI AND RYAN REYNOLDS TEAMING UP FOR IMAGINARY FRIENDS(Photo by Paramount /Courtesy Everett Collection)After two indie films (Brief Interviews with Hideous Men and The Hollars), actor-turned-director John Krasinski had a surprise blockbuster hit with his third film, the sci-fi thriller A Quiet Place (in which he starred with his wife, Emily Blunt). Krasinski quickly moved ahead with a Quiet Place 2 sequel (3/20/2020), but with this week’s news, Krasinski appears ready for another original movie. Krasinski will both direct and costar in the comedy&nbsp;Imaginary Friends, with Ryan Reynolds. The high concept comedy will tell the story of a man (Reynolds) with the magical ability to see other adult people’s imaginary friends, some of which, “lacking love and friendship, turn to the dark side.”5. JURASSIC WORLD 3 RECRUITS NEW STARS FROM SHE’S GOTTA HAVE IT AND SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS(Photo by Netflix / courtesy Everett Collection)A few weeks ago, one of the big stories of that week&nbsp;was that original Jurassic Park stars Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Sam Neill were all returning for Jurassic World 3 (6/11/2021). This week, Universal Pictures appeared to be focusing instead on casting new roles. The first announced was Mamoudou Athie, who is probably best known for his role in Facebook Watch’s Sorry For Your Loss, as well as in The Get Down and Patti Cake$. Then, earlier today, Variety also reported that&nbsp;DeWanda Wise of Netflix’s She’s Gotta Have It is now in talks for a leading role. It’s not yet known what sort of roles either Athie or Wise will be playing when Jurassic World 3 is released on June 2021, the same month as Micronauts, Sesame Street, and The Batman.6. THE ADDAMS FAMILY SEQUEL ALREADY IN DEVELOPMENT FOLLOWING $30 MILLION OPENING WEEKEND(Photo by MGM / courtesy Everett Collection)MGM probably had ideas in the work for a sequel to The Addams Family far before its release last week, but following its $30 million opening weekend, it’s go time. MGM has scheduled&nbsp;The Addams Family 2 for&nbsp;October 22, 2021, which is the weekend after Halloween Ends.&nbsp;It’s not yet known if the original voice cast is also signed&nbsp;&nbsp;to return for the sequel.&nbsp;7. NAOMIE HARRIS JOINING WOODY HARRELSON’S CARNAGE IN VENOM 2 AS SHRIEK(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)We’ve known since the ending of Venom that Woody Harrelson would be costarring in next year’s Venom 2 (10/2/2020) as the crimson symbiote-powered serial killer Carnage. It wasn’t until this week that it was revealed that Tom Hardy’s Venom and Woody Harrelson’s Carnage would actually be joined by a third symbiote-possessed character,&nbsp;&nbsp;in the form of the female villain Shriek. Sony Pictures didn’t delay much after letting that news out, however, as just before we went to “press” today, we learned that Shriek will be portrayed by&nbsp;British actress Naomie Harris (Moonlight, Skyfall).&nbsp;8. DANIEL KALUUYA&nbsp;WANTS TO GIVE THE WORLD A NEW BARNEY THE DINOSAUR MOVIE(Photo by Polygram Filmed Entertainment/courtesy Everett Collection)Last year marked the 20th anniversary of Barney’s Great Adventure,&nbsp;which attempted to take the then-popular kids TV show, Barney &amp; Friends and turn it into a movie franchise. The plan didn’t work and the TV show went off the air in 2009. Even so, Barney &amp; Friends obviously is remembered with some nostalgia by the now-adults who watched the show during its ’90s heyday. And so perhaps it’s not surprising that a Barney reprise is now in development. British actor Daniel Kaluuya, who is probably best known for both Get Out and his role in Black Panther, has teamed up with Mattel Film&nbsp;(via his 59% production company) to start development on a live-action Barney movie. It’s not yet known in what form Barney will be depicted in this movie, but three possible options are: #1 a big purple foam costume like the original TV show, #2 a computer animated (but still cartoony) purple dinosaur, or #3, a full-giant-sized purple Tyrannosaur Rex (the original dinosaurs stood anywhere from 12 to 20 feet tall).&nbsp;9. MELISSA MCCARTHY’S SUPERINTELLIGENCE TO PREMIERE ON HBO MAX INSTEAD OF BIG THEATRICAL RELEASE&nbsp;(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)As we get closer to the end of 2019, we’re close to having seen the trailer debuts for most of the year’s remaining movies. One such film that we had still been waiting on was the Melissa McCarthy comedy Superintelligence, which had long been scheduled for theatrical release on December 20, 2019, up against Bombshell, Cats, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. All three of those are fairly impressive competition, each in their own ways, but even so, the next move for Superintelligence has to be seen as surprising. Melissa McCarthy’s next comedy is skipping theaters entirely, and will instead debut on the new HBO Max streaming service when the app launches sometime in the spring of 2020. All involved are obviously breaking the news in a spirit of celebration, but another way to see Superintelligence not getting a theatrical release as planned is that it fits into the ongoing narrative of certain types of movies moving to streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, sometimes arguably due to the challenges of some genres thriving at the box office in a post-streaming marketplace. Disney did something similar last year, when they transitioned Anna Kendrick’s Noelle away from&nbsp;its theatrical relase date of November 8, 2019 to being a Disney+ launch title.Like this?

This includes large events like SXSW being cancelled, or in the case of Cannes, possibly cancelled, but it’s also affecting specific movies scheduled for release soon. The biggest movie was the next James Bond film, No Time to Die, which was shifted from April 10th seven months back to November 25th, where it will now face off against the Venus and Serena Williams biopic King Richard and the Disney animated fantasy Raya and the Last Dragon. (Trolls World Tour was bumped up one week from 4/17 to 4/10 to take James Bond’s spot.) It’s interesting to note that MGM chose to move No Time to Die back following an online petition&nbsp;that asked for exactly that, despite the studio reportedly being at risk of losing over $30 million by making that move. No Time to Die star Daniel Craig is also still starring on Saturday Night Live this week, despite no longer having a movie to promote. Sony Pictures also moved their WWII movie Greyhound back a month from May 8 to June 12th, but studio insiders denied that it was because of coronavirus concerns. Theatrically, over 70,000 screens have been closed in China, and there is already speculation that theaters could also close in the United States. Those closures in China have led Disney to “delay indefinitely”&nbsp;the release of Mulan&nbsp;in the country, and Paramount has done the same for Sonic the Hedgehog. Two other major films that people are concerned may have to be rescheduled&nbsp;are Marvel’s Black Widow (5/1/2020) and Universal’s F9 (5/22/2020), but as of this writing, their studios have not made any changes.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;THE BATMAN’S BATMOBILE REVEALED(Photo by @mattreevesLA)In the comic books, the various TV shows, and movies from Batman to The Dark Knight, Batman’s main ride, the Batmobile, has taken many different forms. Over time, the argument could be made that the Batmobile has increasingly departed from looking like “a car,” which may have reached its farthest point with the tank-like tumbler Batman drove in Christopher Nolan’s films. In next year’s The Batman (6/25/2021), director Matt Reeves appears to be returning the Batmobile to its original roots of still looking basically like an actual car. In the three images that Reeves revealed this week, the Batmobile does definitely have lots of cool features you won’t find at your local dealership, but it’s close enough to reality that one could imagine how they might soup up their own car to look like it. Robert Pattinson will star as The Batman, along with Jeffrey Wright (Jim Gordon), Zoe Kravitz (Catwoman), Colin Farrell (The Penguin), Paul Dano (The Riddler), and Andy Serkis (Alfred Pennyworth).2. DOCTOR STRANGE DIRECTOR TO TAKE US INTO THE TRIANGULAR MYSTERIES OF BERMUDA(Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images)One of the first big movie development news stories of 2020 was the surprising revelation on January 9th that director Scott Derrickson (Sinister, Doctor Strange) had dropped out of directing the sequel called Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (5/7/2021). Spider-Man director Sam Raimi eventually started negotiations about directing that film instead, and this week, we found out what Derrickson will do next. Derrickson is now in talks with Paramount-based production company Skydance Media (Top Gun: Maverick, Star Trek Beyond) about directing their long-in-development action-adventure project called Bermuda. As you can guess from the title, Bermuda somehow involves the mysteries of the disappearances around the area called the “Bermuda Triangle.” Scott Derrickson will both direct and rewrite Bermuda, in which former Marvel star Chris Evans&nbsp;is also reportedly being eyed to star.3.&nbsp;KUMAIL NANJIANI CONFIRMS HE’S GETTING A BIG BOLLYWOOD DANCE SEQUENCE IN MARVEL’S ETERNALS(Photo by Nicole Rivelli/©Lionsgate)Although anyone who’s familiar with Bollywood could have predicted it, many audiences were probably surprised when eventual Academy Award Best Picture winner Slumdog Millionaire ended with a big Bollywood-style musical dance sequence. Kumail Nanjiani confirmed this week that his upcoming big superhero movie, Marvel’s Eternals (11/6/2020), will itself also have a big Bollywood-style musical number featuring about 50 singers and dancers. The set up for the sequence will be that Nanjiani’s character, Kingo, will hide himself in modern human society by becoming a Bollywood movie star. The direct quote from Nanjiani was this: “So I become a Bollywood movie star; that’s my secret identity. We’re supposed to keep quiet, and I’ve become the biggest Bollywood movie star.” Kumail Nanjiani’s other Eternals co-stars will include Angelina Jolie (Thena), Salma Hayek (Ajak), Lauren Ridloff (Makkari, the MCU’s first deaf superhero), Brian Tyree Henry (Phastos, the MCU’s first gay superhero), Gemma Chan (Sersi), and Game of Thrones stars Richard Madden (Ikaris) and Kit Harrington (Dane Whitman, AKA the Black Knight). In related news, Christian Bale has been confirmed as playing the villain in next year’s Thor: Love and Thunder (11/5/2021 .4.&nbsp;JON HAMM REPLACING JOSH BROLIN IN STEVEN SODERBERGH’S KILL SWITCH(Photo by Netflix)As both traditional television networks and expanding streaming services continue to attract “movie stars” to work on series, it’s becoming something of a trend that stars have to drop out of projects not because of other feature films, but because of TV. The latest example of that is Josh Brolin, who had been expected to star in director Steven Soderbergh’s (Contagion, Magic Mike, Ocean’s Eleven) next film, called Kill Switch. Instead, it will be former Mad Men star Jon Hamm who will take that role, as a cop who is trying to find “a trio of criminals who carry out a home invasion, only to wonder if they’ve been double-crossed when the job goes sideways.” Jon Hamm’s co-stars in Kill Switch will include Marvel stars Don Cheadle (War Machine) and Sebastian Stan (The Winter Soldier), as well as Cedric the Entertainer, who also signed on this week.5. SO YOU THINK YOU CAN CAST A SPELL, HOCUS POCUS 2?(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Various memes about a Hocus Pocus sequel became so common online a few years ago that the popular hoax-debunking site Snopes.com had to create a page just to address it. Proving, however, that nothing is necessarily impossible or too ridiculous to actually happen, Walt Disney Pictures actually did start development on a Hocus Pocus sequel last year,&nbsp;intended to premiere directly on their Disney+ streaming service. The original stars (Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker) haven’t officially signed on to return for the sequel just yet, but they’re presumed to be doing so. This week, the directing job went to&nbsp;Adam Shankman (Hairspray, Rock of Ages), whose profile has gone up in recent years as one of the judges of the competition TV show So You Think You Can Dance? In somewhat related news, the long-planned remake of the 1958 witchcraft romantic comedy Bell, Book &amp; Candle (originally starring James Stewart and Kim Novak) is back in development under new producers, following years in which it was being produced by someone who is now definitely a persona non grata.6. ANTONIO BANDERAS JOINS TOM HOLLAND’S UNCHARTED(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics)The long-in-development feature film adaptation of the popular Uncharted video game franchise is finally getting close to filming after several different directors have come and gone over the last few years. The directing job has finally gone to Ruben Fleischer (Venom, Zombieland), who is partly available for the Uncharted movie this year because he did not return to direct Venom 2 (that job went to Andy Serkis instead). Tom Holland will star as the franchise lead Nathan Drake, in what his costar Mark Wahlberg this week described&nbsp;as an “origin story” comparable to both Indiana Jones (obviously) and The Thomas Crown Affair. Their costars will also now include&nbsp;Antonio Banderas, who is coming off his recent Academy Award nomination for Pain and Glory, and also Tati Gabrielle (Netflix’s The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) and Sophia Ali. Sony Pictures has scheduled Uncharted for release in just under a year from today, on March 5, 2021.7. CHANCE THE RAPPER CAN TELL YOU HOW TO GET TO SESAME STREET(Photo by Charlie Williams/Everett Collection)While some movies can start production mere months before their release dates (Clint Eastwood does this a lot), other movies have to start up over a year in advance (or even several&nbsp;years). One such project that seems to be gearing up that far in advance is Warner Bros’ Sesame Street musical, which is scheduled for release just under two years from now (1/14/2022). Anne Hathaway has been attached to star for a while now, but this week, she got her first (human) co-star in the form of Chance the Rapper, who apparently will also be Chance the Actor, and possibly Chance the Singer. Chance the Rapper will play an aide to “the mayor,” which appears to either be a role that hasn’t been cast yet, or maybe the mayor is actually a Sesame Street Muppet. In the most recent Sesame Street screenplay draft, the Muppets find themselves thrown out of Sesame Street so that they have to team up with a “history show host” (Anne Hathaway) to prove that Sesame Street actually does exist.8.&nbsp;STRANGER THINGS STAR KNOWS THE RULES FOR WEREWOLVES(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)In addition to playing Mike on Stranger Things, Finn Wolfhard has also stayed busy&nbsp;starring in a few different movies with spooky themes, including the two IT movies, The Addams Family (Rotten at 43%), The Turning (Rotten at 12%), and this summer’s upcoming&nbsp;Ghostbusters: Afterlife. For his next film, Wolfhard has chosen a title that only sounds like it’s a supernatural horror film, as he is the first young actor to sign on for the teen crime story Rules for Werewolves. The indie dramatic thriller is based upon a short film of the same title which was to have&nbsp;debuted at SXSW&nbsp;in Austin. Reportedly to be filmed in a “single take” (or possibly edited to look like it was, a la 1917), Rules for Werewolves will tell the story of a “pack of wild teens as they break in and loot a new home, leaving someone (or something) behind for the cops to find.”9.&nbsp;JASON STATHAM DROPS OUT OF PLAYING THE MAN FROM TORONTO WITH KEVIN HART&nbsp;(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)It was just over a month ago that the&nbsp;Weekly Ketchup reported that Jason Statham and Kevin Hart would be teaming up for an action comedy called The Man from Toronto. Filming was reportedly supposed to start in just about six weeks, but the project hit a bump this week, as Jason Statham dropped out of starring. Statham reportedly had “creative issues,” including a disagreement about the planned MPAA rating, which Statham reportedly wanted to be an R, while Sony Pictures instead wanted a PG-13. The Man from Toronto is currently scheduled for release on November 20, 2020, but that may have to be delayed if Sony can’t find a replacement for Statham soon.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Universal, in, cancelled, Guide, Set, Interview, BBC, children's, Witch, universal, It, Trivia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/06135917/Daniel_Craig_No_Time_to_Die-Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"no-time-to-die-gets-pushed-back-to-november-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509176285449","title":"Rocketman‘s Dexter Fletcher Will Direct Sherlock Holmes 3, And More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rocketman's Dexter Fletcher Will Direct Sherlock Holmes 3, And More Movie NewsChris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson join Saw, Don Cheadle joins Space Jam 2, Netflix banks on big stars, and new projects for Gary Oldman and Regina King.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 12, 2019 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news (the stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering&nbsp;up-and-coming titles like Fast and Furious 9, Sherlock Holmes 3, and Space Jam 2.This WEEK’S TOP STORYROCKETMAN‘S DEXTER FLETCHER&nbsp;REPLACES GUY RITCHIE FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES 3(Photo by Warner Bros.)Director Guy Ritchie and stars Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law followed up their 2009 hit Sherlock Holmes (Fresh at 70%) relatively quickly in 2011 with Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (Fresh at 60%). At that point, however, the wait for a third film&nbsp;became a waiting game. That was partly because of Downey’s commitments to various Marvel films, but it might have also been due to Ritchie’s other directing assignments: The Man from U.N.C.L.E., King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, this year’s Aladdin, and next year’s The Gentlemen. Director Dexter Fletcher (Rocketman, Eddie the Eagle) made the news last year when he helped finish Bohemian Rhapsody, and now he’s taking over from Guy Ritchie as the director of Sherlock Holmes 3. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are both signed to return, and Warner Bros has already scheduled Sherlock Holmes 3&nbsp;for December 21, 2021.Fresh Developments1. CHRIS ROCK AND SAMUEL L. JACKSON SET THEIR SAW TRAP(Photo by Kristin Callahan, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Two months ago, the news broke that Chris Rock was producing a new entry in the Saw horror franchise, but at the time, it was not yet clear whether he would have a role in the new film or if he was just producing. There is still a lot we don’t know about this new Saw, but this week, it was confirmed that Chris Rock will be playing a police detective in it, and Samuel L. Jackson has joined the cast as Rock’s father. As this piece points out, the addition of Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson&nbsp;to the franchise returns the sort of star quality that the franchise started with,&nbsp;when Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride) and Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon) starred in the original 2004 film. The film also marks the return to the franchise of director Darren Lynn Bousman, who previously directed Saw II, Saw III, and Saw IV (all three of which received Rotten Tomatometer scores at 37%, 28%, and 18%, respectively). Lionsgate has scheduled the as-yet-untitled&nbsp;Saw film for October 23, 2020, which is a week after Robert Zemeckis’ remake of The Witches&nbsp;and the G.I. Joe assassin spinoff Snake Eyes.2. GARY OLDMAN TO STAR IN DAVID FINCHER’S CITIZEN KANE SCREENWRITER BIOPIC MANK(Photo by Emiley Schweich/Everett Collection)Hollywood has a long&nbsp;history of adapting industry biopics, but most of them are usually about actors or directors. Screenwriters, meanwhile, have been very rarely covered in the genre, especially if you separate those who had careers&nbsp;outside of the movies (2015’s Trumbo is a rare example of a screenwriter biopic). Herman J. Mankiewicz was one of the great screenwriters of Hollywood’s golden age with a filmography that included Dinner at Eight, The Pride of the Yankees, some of the Marx Brothers’ most famous films (Duck Soup, Horse Feathers, Monkey Business), and most famously, Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane. Last year, Netflix released the long-lost Orson Welles film The Other Side of the Wind, and now&nbsp;the streaming studio is developing a Mankiewicz biopic called Mank. Gary Oldman is already attached to star as Mankiewicz in the film, which is expected to be David Fincher‘s (Fight Club, Seven, The Social Network) next project as director&nbsp;after a 5+ year gap following 2014’s Gone Girl.3. HELEN MIRREN AND CHARLIZE THERON BOTH RACING BACK FOR FAST AND FURIOUS 9(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, John Nacion/Everett Collection)This summer sees the release of the spinoff Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw, and the next Fast &amp; Furious film proper is currently three weeks into filming in London. Universal Pictures hasn’t made many official announcements about the returning cast for Fast &amp; Furious 9, but we did learn last month that John Cena would be one of the new actors joining the franchise. (One cast member we know won’t be returning for Fast &amp; Furious 9 is Dwayne Johnson, which he confirmed himself in January.) This week, Vin Diesel did confirm that two returning cast members&nbsp;(both of whom joined the franchise with 2017’s The Fate of the Furious) will be Charlize Theron as Cipher and Helen Mirren as Magdalene Shaw, the mother of the characters played by Jason Statham and Luke Evans (it’s not yet known whether either will return). Universal Pictures has scheduled Fast &amp; Furious 9 for April 10, 2020, and Fast &amp; Furious 10 for April 2, 2021.4. DON CHEADLE JOINS SPACE JAM 2(Photo by DreamWorks courtesy Everett Collection)Following the events of Avengers: Endgame, several of Marvel’s heroes are moving to star in series for the upcoming Disney+ app (The Falcon &amp; The Winter Soldier, Loki, WandaVision, and Hawkeye). One character whose future is not yet known in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is War Machine, as played by Don Cheadle. This week, however, we learned about a new franchise that Cheadle will be joining, as he’s now the biggest non-professional basketball star to join the cast of LeBron James’ sequel Space Jam 2, which is currently filming. Don Cheadle’s role hasn’t been revealed yet, but one has to wonder if he will be just playing himself, like Bill Murray did in the original Space Jam. Warner Bros. hasn’t announced yet which NBA stars will be joining LeBron James in Space Jam 2. The original 1996 Space Jam&nbsp;was Rotten&nbsp;at 43%, but we’re interpreting Don Cheadle’s involvement as Fresh news. Warner Bros. has scheduled Space Jam 2 for July 16, 2021 (the week after Indiana Jones 5).5. REGINA KING TO DIRECT THEATRE ADAPTATION ONE NIGHT IN MIAMI…(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Actress Regina King &nbsp;won an Academy Award earlier this year for her role in If Beale Street Could Talk, but to paraphrase the old saying, maybe what she really wanted to do next was direct. King is now signed to make her feature film directorial debut&nbsp;with an adaptation of the play One Night in Miami…&nbsp;The play’s setting is the night of February 25th, 1964, when the young boxer Cassius Clay (A.K.A. Mohammad Ali) celebrated his win over Sonny Liston at a motel where he was joined by three other icons of the 1960s: civil rights leader Malcolm X, soul singer Sam Cooke, and Cleveland Browns star player Jim Brown. It should be interesting to see whom Regina King will cast as her four leads. Will Smith starred in Ali, and Denzel Washington starred in Malcolm X, but the long-planned Sam Cooke biopic is still in development.6. NETFLIX BETS BIG ON STAR-DRIVEN THRILLERS RED NOTICE AND KATE(Photo by Frank Masi/Columbia Pictures, Jack English/Summit Entertainment, Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)There was a story this week that reported Netflix may start being more “budget conscious” about their film and TV projects. That may be, in a big-picture sort of way, but it also came in the same week that news broke about two star-driven Netflix thrillers. Red Notice is the title of a heist thriller that Universal Pictures had previously scheduled for November 13, 2020, with both Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot attached to star. Reportedly, Universal had “reservations” after the screenplay was turned in, and so the project was picked up by Netflix instead, with Johnson and Gadot now to be joined by Ryan Reynolds. Woody Harrelson also signed on this week to co-star in the assassin thriller Kate, starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead (10 Cloverfield Lane). Red Notice will be directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, who earned Rotten scores for&nbsp;We’re the Miller and Skyscraper, while&nbsp;Kate&nbsp;will be directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, who made his debut with The Huntsman: Winter’s War (Rotten at 18%). Neither of the directors inspires much confidence, but we can’t deny those casts are impressive.7.&nbsp;UNIVERSAL CASTS ITS&nbsp;INVISIBLE MAN(Photo by Steve Dietl/Netflix)Back when Universal Pictures had ambitious plans for a “Dark Universe” of reboots of their classic monsters, Johnny Depp had been expected to star in The Invisible Man, but those plans were dropped&nbsp;after the box office disappointment that was&nbsp;2017’s The Mummy. For a while, there was some confusion over whether or not the movie might be called The Invisible Woman, because Elisabeth Moss (The Handmaid’s Tale, The West Wing) was described&nbsp;as the film’s star. The confusion was cleared up slightly this week as Blumhouse and Universal has cast relative newcomer Oliver Jackson-Cohen (of Netflix’s The Haunting of Hill House) as the title character in The Invisible Man. Univesal has scheduled The Invisible Man for March 13, 2020, up against another monster movie, Godzilla vs Kong. One of the other co-stars in The Invisible Man will be 16-year-old Storm Reid (12 Years a Slave, A Wrinkle in Time), who this week also joined The Suicide Squad (8/6/2021) as the daughter of Idris Elba’s character.Rotten Idea2. MOMO INTERNET HOAX TO GET ITS OWN MOVIE(Photo by DOUGBERRY/Getty Images)It seems longer ago than 2018, but last year, stories started appearing online about the “Momo Challenge,” which reportedly encouraged children and teeangers to put themselves in dangerous or injurious situations. The character called “Momo” was actually a Japanese sculpture called Mother Bird (but really, it most resembles Geena Davis in some scenes from Beetlejuice). Orion Pictures (of the recent Child’s Play reboot) is now teaming up with producer Roy Lee (IT, The Ring) to develop a horror film based on the Momo challenge. The decision to adapt an Internet meme seems similar to Sony PIctures’ choice last year to release a film based on Slender Man, which ended up earning a very low Rotten score at just 7%.1. LOOK WHO’S REMAKING LOOK WHO’S TALKING(Photo by TriStar Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Amy Heckerling’s 1989 comedy&nbsp;Look Who’s Talking (Rotten at 59%)&nbsp;was followed in 1990 by Look Who’s Talking Too (Rotten at 14%), and in 1993 by Look Who’s Talking Now&nbsp;&nbsp;(Rotten at 0%). John Travolta and Kirstie Alley starred in those movies about talking babies and, in the third movie, talking dogs. Despite those critical drubbings, Sony Pictures is now developing&nbsp;a Look Who’s Talking reboot to be written and directed by Jeremy Garelick, whose 2015 comedy The Wedding Ringer&nbsp;earned a Rotten score at 27%. It’s not yet known if Bruce Willis or any of the other voice actors might return for the reboot (but probably not).Like this?

James Gunn has since been hired back, but in the meantime, he jumped ship to work for Warner Bros and DC Comics for The Suicide Squad, which will be a soft reboot sequel to the 2016 super villain movie starring Will Smith and Margot Robbie. This week, James Gunn cast one of his frequent collaborators as well as one of Marvel’s stars. First up was Nathan Fillion, who previously worked with James Gunn on both Slither and Super, and who also had a cameo voice acting role in the first Guardians of the Galaxy. The biggest surprise, however, came with the news that Taika Waititi will also have a role in The Suicide Squad. In addition to directing Thor: Ragnarok (in which he also voiced the alien Korg), Taika Waititi is also returning to write and direct Thor: Love and Thunder (11/3/2021), which will come out less than three months after The Suicide Squad. James Gunn also this week cast comedian Steve Agee to provide the voice of the monstrous super villain King Shark. Warner Bros has scheduled The Suicide Squad for release on August 6, 2021, which will be five days after the fifth anniversary of the release of Suicide Squad on August 1, 2016.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;KIT HARRINGTON TAKING THE BLACK (KNIGHT) AGAIN IN MARVEL’S THE ETERNALS(Photo by George Kraychyk/©TriStar Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)One of the big reveals at Disney’s D23 this past weekend was the casting of Kit Harrington as Dane Whitman, AKA Marvel’s Black Knight, in next year’s The Eternals (11/6/2020). Harrington will be joined by Richard Madden, he of Robb Stark in Game of Thrones, as Ikaris. This came along with confirmation that Gemma Chan will costar in The Eternals&nbsp;just one year after she also costarred in Captain Marvel as the Kree warrior Minn-Erva. The inclusion of Black Knight and Minn-Erva&nbsp;in The Eternals is significant because both characters were long-time members of The Avengers from the 1980s to the 1990s. Black Knight actually first joined as the 14th Avenger in 1969, in-between Vision in 1968 and Black Widow in 1973.&nbsp;So if one wants to speculate about a future Avengers movie, they’re both possibilities.2.&nbsp;BLACK PANTHER II SNAGS MARVEL’S BIGGEST RELEASE DATE FOR THE SUMMER OF 2022(Photo by Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures /Courtesy Everett Collection)Marvel Studios didn’t invent the notion of the weekend closest to May 1st being the best spot to start the summer season (that was arguably the 1999 reboot of The Mummy), but they’ve certainly perfected the move. In recent years, that has included Avengers: Age of Ultron (5/1/2015), Captain America: Civil War (5/6/2016), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (5/5/2017), Avengers: Infinity War (4/27/2018), and Avengers: Endgame (4/26/2019), and will include Black Widow (5/1/2020) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (5/7/2020). One of the highly anticipated films that was left out of Marvel’s big panel of announcements at SDCC this year was Black Panther II, but we learned last weekend that they were just saving that news for D23, where Marvel revealed that Black Panther II is scheduled for May 6, 2022. No other premise or cast details were confirmed, but presumably, Chadwick Boseman, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright will all be back.3.&nbsp;BOYHOOD DIRECTOR TO SPEND 20 YEARS FILMING MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG(Photo by Wilson Webb/©Lionsgate/courtesy Everett Collection)As of this writing in 2019, Broadway singer/actor Ben Platt is 25, and actress Beanie Feldstein is 26. But when their new movie comes out, they’ll be more like 45 and 46. That’s because Platt and Feldstein have both signed to star in a new musical from director Richard Linklater, who famously spent 12 years making the 2014 Academy Award-winning drama Boyhood. That musical will be an adaptation of Stephen Sondheim’s 1981 play Merrily We Roll Along, which was itself based on the 1934 play of the same name. Sondheim’s play was set across a period from 1957 to 1976, and as with Boyhood, Richard Linklater plans on filming Merrily We Go Along over a 20 year period just like how its plot unfolds. Presuming Merrily We Roll Along is released around 2039 or 2040, Richard Linklater (born 7/30/1960) will be between 78 and 80.4. JAMIE FOXX AND TINA FEY TO STAR IN NEXT YEAR’S SECOND PIXAR FILM, SOUL(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)As much of an “info dump” as San Diego Comic-Con is, Disney’s own D23 convention almost matches that. This year, a lot of that went to the upcoming Disney+ streaming app’s content, but Disney itself made a few big feature film announcements. We’ve known for a while now that Pixar’s next film will be Onward (3/6/2020), a modern fantasy starring MCU stars Tom Holland and Chris Pratt. But that’s not all for Pixar in 2020: They also have Soul on their schedule for release on June 16, 2020. Pixar revealed at D23 that the stars of Soul will be Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey. Fey will voice a disembodied human soul in the afterlife, with Jamie Foxx voicing a music teacher who appears to kick it just before a big career opportunity (cue the comparisons to Mr. Holland’s Opus and also Pixar’s Coco). Foxx and Fey will also be joined by the voices of Daveed Diggs (Blindspotting), Questlove (of The Roots and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon), and Phylicia Rashad (TV’s The Cosby Show), with Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) collaborating on the film’s score.5.&nbsp;PAUL RUDD GROWS UP TO BE ANTHONY MICHAEL HALL IN NEXT YEAR’S HALLOWEEN KILLS(Photo by Vertical Entertainment / courtesy Everett Collection)Quite the phenomenon when a future megastar gets their career start in a horrible horror movie. Take, for example, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, the sixth film in the horror franchise, which featured Paul Rudd as Tommy Doyle, one of the kids Laurie Strode was babysitting in the first movie. Jamie Lee Curtis returned as Laurie Strode in last year’s hit “soft reboot” sequel Halloween (which earned over $255 million worldwide), and she’s returning for Halloween Kills (10/16/2020) and (possibly) Halloween Ends (10/15/2021), which will soon be filmed back-to-back. Paul Rudd was indeed approached about returning as Tommy Doyle, but due to scheduling conflicts with Ghostbusters 2020 (7/10/2020), Tommy Doyle will instead be played by Anthony Michael Hall. Rudd and Hall may not resemble each other, but if the Halloween slasher franchise now serves as a nostalgia feast, the casting of the costar of 1980s movies like Sixteen Candles, Weird Science, and The Breakfast Club fits that theme perfectly.6.&nbsp;DISNEY ANIMATION’S POST-FROZEN II TO BE RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON(Photo by Disney)Disney has had a mystery project scheduled for November 25, 2020 for a while, but it wasn’t until last weekend’s D23 that Disney revealed that it will be Raya and the Last Dragon. The animated fantasy adventure will be set in a fictional kingdom called Kumandra, which will be inspired by the cultures of Southeast Asia. Raya and the Last Dragon will mark the directorial debuts of Paul Briggs and Dean Wellins, who previously worked on Disney movies like Big Hero 6 and Zootopia. The screenplay is being written by Adele Lim, whose Crazy Rich Asians featured Awkwafina, now also a voice role in Raya. The title character to be voiced by Cassie Steele of TV’s Degrassi: The Next Generation.7.&nbsp;EVA LONGORIA TO DIRECT THE FLAMIN’ HOT CHEETOS MOVIE(Photo by Bauer Martinez Films/courtesy Everett Collection)Fox Searchlight has been moving forward with plans for a movie called Flamin’ Hot about how the popular brand of Cheetos snack foods came to be. They’re hiring Eva Longoria to direct the true story of Richard Montanez, who was a janitor at Frito-Lay when he came up with the Flamin’ Hot Cheetos concept after noticing that regular Cheetos were not as “flavorful” as Mexican snacks on the same convenience store shelves.8.&nbsp;HAPPY DEATH DAY DIRECTOR TO BODY SWAP VINCE VAUGHN AND 22-YEAR-OLD KATHRYN NEWTON(Photo by Giles Keyte / © Warner Bros. / courtesy Everett Collection)Director Chris Landon is newly available as it appears unlikely that Happy Death Day will receive another sequel after this year’s box office disappointment of 2U, which earned just $28 million domestically. For his next film, Landon will cowrite and direct a body swapping thriller. Vince Vaughn will star as a “deranged serial killer” whose body is taken over by a high school student played by 22-year-old Kathryn Newton, whose previous work includes Paranormal Activity 4 and Detective Pikachu.Like this?

OK, here we go…This WEEK’S TOP STORYRobert Pattinson&nbsp;In Talks for&nbsp;The Batman, Along with Nicholas Hoult(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection, @ Warner Bros. Pictures, Jason Smith/Everett Collection)British actor Robert Pattinson made his film debut as Cedric Diggory in 2005’s Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire but he’s probably still most recognized for playing the vampire Edward Cullen in the five Twlight Saga films. Now in his 30s, Pattinson has lately been focusing on independent and non-Hollywood films like Good Time, High Life, The Rover, and The Lost City of Z. Thursday night, the news broke that Pattinson is now in talks to continue his relationship with Warner Bros.&nbsp;(which produced the Harry Potter&nbsp;films)&nbsp;in one of their highest-profile upcoming projects, the DC Comics adaptation The Batman. That report came from Variety, but some competitors are cautioning that the deal with Pattinson is not final, with Nicholas Hoult (Tolkien, About a Boy) also in the running, if Pattinson does not sign on. The Batman will be the first solo movie for the DC Comics superhero since The Dark Knight Rises, and will be directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In), whose most recent film was 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes. Pattinson’s next film for Warner Bros. will be an untitled Christopher Nolan’s project (July 7, 2020), with The Batman scheduled nearly a year later on June 25, 2021.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;The Next&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;Trilogy, Kicking off in 2022, Comes Via the&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;Showrunners(Photo by Gregorio T. Binuya/Everett Collection)Much has been made this week about the declining Tomatometer scores for the last two episodes of Game of Thrones, but seen from the big picture, the show still retains an impressive 91% Tomatometer score. Having said that, Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Pictures may have been better off announcing this week’s news earlier in the month. Last week, Disney confirmed that the Star Wars franchise will take a three-year hiatus after Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (December 20, 2019) with new films every two years thereafter (December 12, 2022; December 20, 2024; December 18, 2026). This week we learned that the first of these new Star Wars films in 2022 will be produced by Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. That revelation came with almost no other details, but there are lingering rumors that their Star Wars project will be set in the same era as the Star Wars: The Old Republic video games. Star Wars: The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson is also reportedly working on a new Star Wars trilogy.2.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Real&nbsp;Mandarin will appear in the MCU(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)As it turned out, Thanos was the “big bad” of the first 20 or so films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If we look back to the original Iron Man, however, the villain that was being teased was the Mandarin, one of Iron Man’s oldest arch-nemeses. The road to the Mandarin continued in 2013 with Iron Man 3, and the “All Hail the King” Marvel One-Shot short film, but we have not yet seen the Mandarin in his classic form. This week, in a Reddit AMA, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige directly addressed The Mandarin, answering “Yes” to a question about future plans for the character. As to when we might see the Mandarin, one strong and obvious possibility is the Shang-Chi movie, which is currently in active development.3.&nbsp;Sebastian Stan Joins Lupita Nyong’o and&nbsp;Jessica Chastain in Spy Movie&nbsp;355(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Something that we point out all the time here is that there have been so many Marvel movies by this point that many new films have at least a couple of Marvel stars (especially if we can include the Fox movies). Jessica Chastain (who’s joining the club with next month’s Dark Phoenix) is producing and starring in a new international spy movie called 355, which will start filming on July 8 in Paris before moving to London and Morocco. 355 will feature several female costars, including Lupita Nyong’o (Black Panther), Penelope Cruz, and Fan Bingbing (Blink from X-Men: Days of Future Past). We can now also add to the cast Sebastian Stan, a.k.a. the Winter Soldier, and Edgar Ramirez (who costarred with Penelope Cruz in TV’s The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story). (Marion Cotillard had previously been attached to costar but has recently dropped out.) The title 355 is a reference to “Agent 355,” a female spy during the American Revolution.4.&nbsp;Rami Malek Finds Denzel Washington’s&nbsp;Little Things(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek recently signed on to star in the next James Bond film as the its villain, and this week, he signed on for another new project. Malek is in talks with Warner Bros. to join Denzel Washington in the police crime thriller The Little Things. Washington will play “a burned-out cop up in Kern County who teams with Baxter (Malek), a crack detective from the LA Sheriff’s Department, to catch a serial killer.” The Little Things refers to Washington’s character’s ability to see the “little things that can help solve a case.”5.&nbsp;Emma Thompson Joins Emma Stone In Disney’s&nbsp;Cruella(Photo by @ A24)Walt Disney Pictures is proceeding, a few movies a year, in their far-reaching plans to adapt their classic animated movies into live-action films (including next week’s Aladdin). Just last week, Disney announced a release date of December 23, 2020 for Cruella, their live-action reimagining of the villain character from 101 Dalmatians. Emma Stone has been attached for a while to play Cruella in the film, which will be set in the world of high fashion of the 1970s. Another Emma, Emma Thompson, signed on this week to play the film’s antagonist, which also gives us a better idea about the premise (basically, it’s a prequel to 101 Dalmatians). Stone’s version of Cruella will be “a brilliant clothing designer who nonetheless toils as a lowly department store worker. One day, a posh woman known as the Baroness (Thompson) enters the store, wearing Cruella’s special locket that was given to her by her mother,” leading Cruella to plot against her. Cruella is scheduled to come out five days after Coming to America 2 and Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story, and the same day as The Croods 2.6.&nbsp;Robert De Niro, Tommy Lee Jones, And Morgan Freeman Team Up on&nbsp;The Comeback Trail(Photo by @ Broad Green Pictures, © Vertical Entertainment /Courtesy Everett Collection, ©20th Century Fox Film Corp. All rights reserved./Courtesy Everett Collection)Every few years or so, we get another movie that brings together a few older movie stars. Tommy Lee Jones starred in Space Cowboys (with Clint Eastwood, James Garner, and Donald Sutherland), and then in 2013, Robert De Niro and Morgan Freeman costarred in Last Vegas (for just two examples). The latest such movie is called The Comeback Trail, and the stars this time around will be De Niro and Freeman again, plus Jones. De Niro will play a man in debt to a mob boss (Freeman) who “creates an insurance fraud by casting washed-up, suicidal cowboy/movie star Duke Montana (Jones) in a poorly written Western with the intention of killing him during the first days of filming.” Zach Braff (of TV’s Scrubs) will also costar in The Comeback Trail as De Niro’s business partner.#7.&nbsp;Chris Rock (!?) delivering&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;Spin-off for 2020(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection, @ Lionsgate)Way before James Wan directed movies like The Conjuring and Aquaman, he was actually the director of the very first Saw movie in 2004 (and he produced several of the sequels). The torture-trap horror franchise is on its way back to theaters for next year (October 23, 2020), but it’s coming to us via a celebrity producer in the form of Saturday Night Live alum Chris Rock. Rock is reportedly a longtime fan of the Saw movies and came to the untitled Saw spin-off with his own pitch for how to start a new story that is not a reboot, but one that will “work within the existing Saw mythology.” The new Saw movie will be directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, the director of Saw II (37%), Saw III (28%), Saw IV (18%), and 11-11-11 (7%) – but could the involvement of Chris Rock and James Wan turn things around?Rotten Ideas2.&nbsp;James Wan Producing&nbsp;Mortal Kombat&nbsp;RebootJoel MearesLast week’s Pokémon Detective Pikachu may have broken box office records, and also have the first ever “Fresh” Tomatometer score for a video-game adaptation, but one movie doesn’t make for an instant rebound for the entire concept. Regardless, Hollywood is still chugging along with its collective plans for video-game movies, and this week, we learned that Mortal Kombat is one of the already attempted (a few times) video game franchises that’s coming back. Producer James Wan is on board this attempt at rebooting Mortal Kombat, which is scheduled to start filming in Australia later this year. It’s not yet clear which Mortal Kombat games or characters will be adapted for this new movie.&nbsp; The first Mortal Kombat was “Rotten” with 46%, and its sequel Annihilation was much lower with just 2%. With Wan on board, the reboot could nudge Fresh territory, but we’re waiting to see.1.&nbsp;Can Paramount Take On Marvel With Obscure Atlas Comics Movies?The biggest challenge for any movie studio that’s not Disney or Warner Bros. in challenging their superhero movies is that there is only one Marvel Comics, and only one DC Comics. Sure, there are other comic book companies, but none of them are the “big two.” One company that briefly tried to get into their space in the 1970s was Atlas Comics, formed by Martin Goodman, the original founder of the 1930s company that later became Marvel Comics. Atlas Comics launched with dozens of titles and some notable writers and artists, but they mostly were all cancelled within three or four issues. Paramount Pictures has regardless started an agreement to adapt Atlas Comics titles into superhero movies. The possible movies include such titles as The Cougar, Ironjaw, Tigar-Man, Grim Ghost, and The Hands of the Dragon. We’re calling this play by Paramount one of the week’s Rotten Ideas just because taking on Marvel and DC seems crazy: Atlas Comics was never going to, and still isn’t, ever going to compete with titles like The Avengers, Justice League, or X-Men. But then again, remember when folks thought Iron Man was too obscure to launch a franchise…Like this?

Jordan, and Charlize Theron.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHOR STAR WILL SMASH PUNY WRESTLERS AS HULK (HOGAN)(Photo by Hopper Stone/Columbia Pictures)Professional wrestling may not be as popular as it once was, but that’s also relative to exactly how popular it once was, like in the 1980s and the 1990s. The World Wrestling Federation’s top star, at the height of their popularity, was indisputably Terry Bollea, AKA Hulk Hogan. Unlike the WWF/WWE’s other “most popular star,” Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Hulk Hogan was never able to convert his wrestling fame to “movie star” fame, but he was still very, very popular, including starring in a Saturday morning cartoon, many video games, and four seasons of the Hogan Knows Best reality show. Throw in this far-reaching legal ruling, and it makes total sense that Netflix is following up on GLOW with a Hulk Hogan biopic from director Todd Phillips (The Hangover, October’s Joker). What’s perhaps more surprising is that the famously Floridian wrestler will be played by Australia’s Chris Hemsworth (that’s right, Thor’s going to play Hulk). Having said that, Hemsworth has already shown that he can drop his Aussie accent in movies like Cabin in the Woods and Bad Times at the El Royale. Netflix’s film will reportedly focus mostly on Terry Bollea’s creation of the Hulk Hogan persona, and the height of his popularity during the “Hulkamania” era. (If you’ve ever been curious about how Bollea was able to even call himself Hulk Hogan, you can actually read his 1985 contract with Marvel Comics right here.)Fresh Developments1. DUNE WORM SURFS INTO PRIME NOVEMBER 2020 RELEASE DATE(Photo by Ben Rothstein/Marvel Studios)One of the hottest times of the year to release a movie&nbsp;is the middle of November, right before Thanksgiving. Notably, that’s the period when four of the Harry Potter movies were released, and until this week, it was also when Warner Bros. had scheduled the third Fantastic Beasts prequel (which is now on hold following the second film’s disappointing box office). Instead, WB has scheduled their remake of Dune for November 20, 2020, which instantly made&nbsp;it&nbsp;the last big movie scheduled before James Cameron’s Avatar 2 (12/18/2020). The writing has been “on the sand” for a few weeks now that Dune might be a huge movie, as it features an all-star cast&nbsp;that&nbsp;includes Timothée Chalamet (as Paul Atreides), Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Stellan Skarsgard, and Zendaya. This week, David Dastmalchian, who had a supporting role in Marvel’s Ant-Man and the Wasp, also joined the cast as Piter De Vries (played by Brad Dourif in the 1984 Dune). This Dune remake is being directed by Denis Villeneuve, who has never scored below 71%&nbsp;on the Tomatometer and whose last three films were all Certified Fresh at 86% or higher.2.&nbsp;DANIEL KALUUYA, LAKEITH STANFIELD&nbsp;JOIN BLACK PANTHER BIOPIC JESUS WAS MY HOMEBOY(Photo by Justin Lubin/Universal Pictures)Every once in a while, a new project comes along that takes elements from a few different recent box office (or critical) hits and puts them all in a blender to produce an intriguing new film. For this story, the movies in question are Black Panther, Mudbound, Get Out, and Sorry to Bother You. Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out) is in talks to star as Black Panther Party member Fred Hampton&nbsp;in a biopic called Jesus Was My Homeboy for Warner Bros. Lakeith Stanfield, who starred in&nbsp;Sorry to Bother You and had a small supporting role in&nbsp;Get Out, is also in talks for the film, which will be produced for the studio by Black Panther director Ryan Coogler and Charles D. King (Mudbound, Sorry to Bother You). Coogler is also working with Warner Bros. on 2021’s Space Jam 2&nbsp;(more on that below).3. JAMES BOND 25 AND FAST &amp; FURIOUS 9 SCHEDULED FOR APRIL AND MAY OF 2020(Photo by Francois Duhamel/Columbia Pictures)Both James Bond 25 and Fast &amp; Furious 9 were already scheduled for release next year, but this week saw both films shifting their specific release dates. Let’s start with James Bond 25 (the title will definitely change before release), which had been scheduled for Valentine’s Day, but has now been shifted back two months to April 8, 2020. That move is good news for the animated fantasy adventure Nimona, which is still scheduled for February 14, 2020. James Bond 25 is taking the date formerly occupied by Fast &amp; Furious 9, which has been pushed back a month to May 22, 2020, up against The SpongeBob Movie: It’s a Wonderful Sponge (and a week before Disney’s Maleficent II). Neither Fast &amp; Furious 9 nor James Bond 25 have actually started filming yet. James Bond 25 is scheduled to start production in April, and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns (Contagion, Side Effects) has been hired to rewrite the screenplay with just four weeks to work on it. Daniel Craig will be working on James Bond 25, and then in the spring of 2020 he will move on&nbsp;to The Creed of Violence, set during the Mexican Revolution in 1910.4. MICHAEL B. JORDAN TO STAR IN A JOURNAL FOR JORDAN(Photo by Marvel Studios)2018 was a big year for Michael B. Jordan, as he starred in Black Panther, HBO’s Fahrenheit 451 remake, and the Rocky franchise sequel Creed II. Hollywood hasn’t been shy about giving him more opportunities either, including the bestselling book adaptation Just Mercy (1/17/2020) and Tom Clancy’s Without Remose (9/18/2020). Two other Michael B. Jordan projects moved forward this week, starting with Lionsgate’s action thriller The Silver Bear, which will be directed by Gerard McMurray (2018’s The First Purge), who was also one of the producers on Jordan’s breakout drama Fruitvale Station. The Silver Bear is based on a series of bestselling novels by Derek Haas (showrunner of NBC’s various Chicago shows), so&nbsp;it’s seen as a potential franchise starter. Jordan is also (rather appropriately) in talks to star in A Journal for Jordan, a drama expected to be Denzel Washington’s next film as director (his&nbsp;Fences&nbsp;was Certified Fresh at 92%).5. CHARLIZE THERON IS NETFLIX’S LATEST BIG STAR AS A MEMBER OF THE OLD GUARD(Photo by Andres Otero/Everett Collection)Netflix’s recent hit thriller Bird Box, starring Sandra Bullock, was far from the streamer’s first star-driven project (Brad Pitt’s War Machine comes to mind, too), but it definitely showed that Hollywood A-listers are open to working with them. The latest one to sign on at Netflix is Charlize Theron, who will star in the action movie The Old Guard. The&nbsp;film will be based on the Image Comics title of the same name created by writer Greg Rucka (Wonder Woman) and artist Leandro Fernandez (Deadpool, Punisher: MAX). Theron and KiKi Layne (If Beale Street Could Talk) will play members of a group of immortal mercenaries “who must fight to keep their team together when they discover the existence of a new immortal and their extraordinary abilities are exposed.”&nbsp;The Old Guard will be directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, who at one point had been expected to direct the Black Cat/Silver Sable movie for Sony Pictures.6.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN MARVEL: GWYNETH PALTROW DONE, BLACK WIDOW AND LOKI (SERIES) NEWS(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Studios)The influence and success of Marvel Studios is so pervasive that it’s a rare week with no development news from their corner. This was a relatively slow week, but there were still at least three items of note. The story that seemed to receive the most notice came from Gwyneth Paltrow, who basically “announced” that after Avengers: Endgame (4/26/2019) she is done playing her Iron Man&nbsp;character Pepper Potts. With no confirmed future Marvel movies for Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man (yet), it’s sort of unsurprising, but in the same way, it could be interpreted as a hint that Downey may be the next big Marvel star to drop out (after Chris Evans, who’s done as Captain America). One female character Marvel Studios is definitely not done with is Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow, who is expected to get her own film sometime in the 2020 to 2022 range. To that end, the studio has hired screenwriter Ned Benson (The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby) to rewrite the Black Widow screenplay&nbsp;begun by Jac Schaeffer (TiMER, The Hustle). This move is raising some eyebrows because Black Widow, which will be directed by Cate Shortland, had been seen as a heavily female-led production. Finally, in related news, the Loki series that will stream on the upcoming Disney+ app will be written by Michael Wadron of the popular animated series Rick and Morty.7.&nbsp;LEBRON JAMES’ SPACE JAM 2 CONFIRMED FOR THE SUMMER OF 2021(Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images)There has seemingly been talk about a Space Jam sequel pretty much since the weekend that the Looney Tunes basketball movie (Rotten at 38%) first came out in 1996. Although it’s true that LeBron James has been talking about Space Jam 2&nbsp;for a while, a skeptical fan still could have wondered if this thing would really happen. Well, Warner Bros. is making it official this week, as the studio has announced a Space Jam 2 release date of July 16, 2021. This puts the CGI/basketball hybrid comedy a week after Indiana Jones 5&nbsp;and a week before Mission: Impossible 7. The other big move from Warner Bros. this week shifted Godzilla vs Kong (the fourth of their monster movies after this year’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters, 5/31/2019) from May 22, 2020 to March 13, 2020. That May 22, 2020 date is where Fast and Furious 9 is now scheduled, and the new competition for Godzilla vs Kong on March 13, 2020 is the less imposing John Cena movie Playing with Fire.Rotten Ideas2. SYLVESTER STALLONE JOINING THE SUPERHERO BANDWAGON WITH SAMARITAN(Photo by Barry Wetcher/MGM)Even if you set aside the studio-bound franchises of Marvel/Disney and DC/WB, there are still thousands of comic book properties out there that one could theoretically adapt into a movie. So it’s sort of baffling to hear the news this week that MGM has acquired, following a “competitive bidding situation” an original superhero spec script called Samaritan. (It’s also worth noting that “Samaritan” is the lead character in Kurt Busiek’s long-running and award-winning Astro City comic book series.) MGM has already attached Sylvester Stallone to star in Samaritan, continuing a relationship that goes back to the original Rocky films. The Samaritan premise reportedly revolves around “a boy learning that a missing superhero, who vanished 20 years earlier after a battle, may still be alive.”&nbsp;Samaritan is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because Sylvester Stallone’s recent Tomatometer is mostly Rotten (not counting documentaries or the Creed movies).1.&nbsp;DEBUNKED RUMOR OF THE WEEK: ARMIE HAMMER WON’T BE THE BATMAN(Photo by Daniel Smith/Warner Bros.)Arguably, the best online rumors are at least partially based on some level of truth. Consider, for example, the relationship between Batman and Armie Hammer (The Social Network, Call Me By Your Name). Back in the 2000s, Mad Max: Fury Road director George Miller nearly made Justice League: Mortal, in which Hammer (then an unknown) would have played Batman. That may explain why people so quickly believed this week’s reports that Hammer was in talks with Warner Bros. to replace Ben Affleck in The Batman (6/25/2021). The thing is that the story was (as far as we currently know) totally “bunk,” which means that it needed to be “debunked.” We’re calling this the week’s “Rotten Idea” because, honestly, Armie Hammer might still be a pretty great choice to play both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Like Bruce Wayne, Armie Hammer comes from a well-to-do family, and he’s also one of the few movie stars of a certain profile who hasn’t yet signed on for a major role in the current Marvel vs DC franchise wars.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"star, hard, heist, leads, actors, boxoffice, Holidays, TCA, comic, Western, awards, Alien, Amazon, Arts","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/22113225/Chris_Hemsworth_Ketchup.jpg","slug":"chris-hemsworth-to-star-in-hulk-hogan-biopic-plus-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509177875735","title":"Rachel Weisz and David Harbour in Talks for Black Widow, Plus More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rachel Weisz and David Harbour in Talks for Black Widow, Plus More Movie NewsMark Hamill joins Child's Play, The Suicide Squad re-ups, and the Bad Moms' Moms begin their quest for world domination.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 5, 2019 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;titles like the sequels to Bad Moms, Ghostbusters, and A Quiet Place.This WEEK’S TOP STORYRACHEL WEISZ AND DAVID HARBOUR IN TALKS FOR&nbsp;BLACK WIDOW(Photo by John Lamparski, Jeff Kravitz/Getty Images)Marvel Studios is preparing to shoot their next two films this summer for likely 2020 releases. It was just last week that we heard about Angelina Jolie being in talks for a lead role in The Eternals, but that’s not actually the next film in the works. Marvel is closer to starting production on the Black Widow solo film, starring Scarlett Johansson, with filming scheduled to begin in June. Florence Pugh (Fighting with My Family, Lady MacBeth) was announced last month for Black Widow, and this week, it was revealed that two more stars&nbsp;are in talks. Rachel Weisz (The Favourite) is now in talks for a role in Black Widow. David Harbour (Stranger Things), who will star later this month in the Hellboy, is also in talks for a Black Widow role. We don’t yet have any clue what the Black Widow movie is about (including whether it’s a prequel or is set after Avengers: Endgame), or what characters Pugh, Weisz, or Harbour might be playing. (This writer’s guess for Rachel Weisz is long-time HYDRA leader Viper.) Black Widow may be the Marvel Studios movie scheduled for May 1, 2020.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;CILLIAN MURPHY JOINS&nbsp;A QUIET PLACE 2(Photo by Anthony Harvey/Getty Images)Last year’s monster/suspense movie A Quiet Place (Certified Fresh at 95%) was a surprise box office hit, with over $340 million worldwide from a budget of just $17 million. Paramount quickly greenlit a sequel for next year (May 15, 2020), with real life married couple Emily Blunt and John Krasinski returning (as actress and writer/director, respectively). This week, it was confirmed that the the two surviving kid actors (Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds) would be returning for the sequel, and also the first new cast member for the sequel. Frequent Christopher Nolan collaborator and Peaky Blinders star&nbsp;Cillian Murphy&nbsp;will join Emily Blunt in the A Quiet Place sequel as a character who is&nbsp;described as a “man with mysterious intentions who joins the family unit.” The other movie scheduled against A Quiet Place 2 is the animated Scooby-Doo reboot Scoob, featuring the voices of Zac Efron, Tracy Morgan, and Amanda Seyfried.2. EMMA STONE AND RALPH FIENNES MAY STAR IN HORROR COMEDY THE MENU(Photo by Sabrina Lantos/Sony Classics)After six Academy Award nominations, and two wins (for Adapted Screenplay), Alexander Payne&nbsp;had his first Rotten film as director with 2017’s Downsizing. For his next film, Payne is reportedly recruiting Emma Stone (three Oscar nominations, one win) and Ralph Fiennes (two Academy Award nominations). Described as a “comedic horror-thriller,” the movie is called The Menu, and is about a couple “who travel to a remote island to attend an exclusive restaurant where the acclaimed chef (Fiennes) has prepared a lavish tasting menu, along with some shocking surprises.” Although Alexander Payne won both of his Academy Awards as screenwriter, The Menu was instead written by late night TV show staff writers Will Tracy (Last Week Tonight with John Oliver) and Seth Reiss (Late Night with Seth Meyers). Emma Stone will next co-star in the sequels Zombieland: Double Tap (10/11/2019) and The Croods 2 (9/18/2020), and Ralph Fiennes has at least three films scheduled for 2020 as well.3.&nbsp;MARK HAMILL TO VOICE CHUCKY IN&nbsp;NEW&nbsp;CHILD’S PLAY(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)Enough fans of the Child’s Play franchise have been talking about Brad Dourif not voicing “Chucky” in this summer’s Child’s Play reboot (6/21/2019) that “no Brad Dourif” is a top autocorrect result on Google search. Curiously, for a movie that is just over two months away from release, however, we didn’t actually know for sure who would be voicing Chucky instead. As it turns out, the actor&nbsp;taking on the role is the one famous for voicing the Joker in dozens of video games and animated TV shows. Mark Hamill is obviously best known for his role as Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars franchise, and he can now add&nbsp;Child’s Play to the list of franchises he’s associated with. Hamill announced his participation in a video that debuted at this past weekend’s WonderCon in Anaheim.4.&nbsp;VIOLA DAVIS, JAI COURTNEY TO RETURN IN&nbsp;THE SUICIDE SQUAD(Photo by Warner Bros.)When director James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad (8/6/2021) was first announced, it was quickly described as a soft reboot with a new cast of supervillains. That, however, was before it was confirmed that Margot Robbie would indeed be returning as Harley Quinn. (We also thought Deadshot would be returning, albeit&nbsp;in the form of Idris Elba instead of Will Smith, though it later turned out that’s not the character Elba would be playing.) This week, we learned of two more actors from the 2016 version&nbsp;who are returning in the same roles. Viola Davis will once again play Amanda Waller, the government agent who brings together the various super villains, and&nbsp;Jai Courtney also talked this week about returning as Captain Boomerang (although it’s possible that his character won’t survive).5. STERLING K. BROWN TO STAR AS JANITOR-TURNED-COACH IN RISE(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Chrissy Metz of NBC’s This is Us will star in the faith-based drama Breakthrough later this month, and this week, one of her co-stars also signed on for his own faith-based drama. Sterling K. Brown is in talks with Sony’s AFFIRM Films (Miracles from Heaven, Heaven is for Real) to star in their inspirational sports drama called Rise. If he signs on, Brown will portray Louisiana middle school janitor Willie Davis, who took over his school’s basketball program&nbsp;and went on to compete in the state championship. Rise is based on Davis’ true life story, which has previously been reported on by HBO’s Real Sports. Sony has already scheduled Rise for release a year from next week, on April 10, 2020 (up against James Bond 25).6.&nbsp;AWKWAFINA PLANS MORE HEISTS IN CRIME AFTER CRIME(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)&nbsp;Relative newcomer Awkwafina had a great 2018, with prominent roles in both Ocean’s Eight and Crazy Rich Asians, and she’s now getting ready to produce a new film&nbsp;called Crime After Crime. Awkwafina’s costar (and co-producing partner) will be Ike Barinholtz (The Mindy Project, Blockers). Awkwafina will play “a millennial podcast host who agrees to help the convict (Barinholtz) she’s devoted her true-crime podcast to prove his innocence after he escapes jail and turns up at her house.” Awkwafina will also co-star in this year’s third Jumanji movie (12/13/2019).7.&nbsp;YOUNG STAR JOINS THE GHOSTBUSTERS FAMILY(Photo by Wilson Webb/Fox Searchlight Pictures)We haven’t yet heard about any of the original Ghostbusters being cast in next year’s new film;&nbsp;instead, the focus thus far has been on a family&nbsp;at the center of the story. The casting started with Carrie Coon (The Leftovers) and Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things,&nbsp;IT), who are playing mother and son. This week, we learned of another family member, their daughter/sister, who will be played by McKenna Grace. In addition to&nbsp;a small role&nbsp;in Captain Marvel&nbsp;portraying the young Carol Danvers, McKenna Grace was also the lead in Gifted&nbsp;and the young Tonya Harding in I, Tonya. Grace and Wolfhard’s characters are expected to be joined by two more preteens/teens. The next Ghostbusters&nbsp;is scheduled for July 10, 2020 (the week before Christopher Nolan’s next film).Rotten Ideas2. MELISSA MCCARTHY AND OCTAVIA SPENCER LEAD NETFLIX SUPERHERO MOVIE(Photo by Dan MacMedan, Jeff Kravitz/Getty Images)Netflix may have cancelled their various Marvel series (Daredevil, Luke Cage, etc.) but that doesn’t mean they’re showing any sign of being out of the superhero business. In addition to The Umbrella Academy, Netflix also has a deal with Kick-Ass and Kingsman creator Mark Millar. This week, the streaming giant started talks with two legitimate movie stars to star in a superhero movie called Thunder Force. Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer would both play women who gain superpowers in&nbsp;the film, which will be&nbsp;written and directed by McCarthy’s husband Ben Falcone, who’s also directing McCarthy in this year’s Superintelligence (12/20/2019). Since Falcone started working behind the camera with McCarthy, all of their collaborations&nbsp;have earned Rotten Tomatometer scores: Tammy (24%), The Boss (22%), and Life of the Party (38%).1.&nbsp;THE BAD MOMS’ MOMS TO GET THEIR OWN MOVIE(Photo by STX Entertainment)After Bad Moms earned $183 million globally in the summer of 2016, it was followed by the sequel A Bad Moms Christmas in 2017. That second film introduced the grandma characters played by Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines, and Susan Sarandon, and now they’re going to get their own movie&nbsp;called Bad Moms’ Moms. It’s not yet known if Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, and Mila Kunis will reprise their roles as well, or if the third movie might introduce the next set of older great-grandmas (who could then get their own movie called Bad Moms’ Moms’ Moms). Both Bad Moms and A Bad Moms Christmas received Rotten Tomatometer scores (58% and 30% respectively).Like this?

This year, that was true for both of the male actors (maybe next week, Regina King and Olivia Colman?). Before his Academy Award-winning portrayal of Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, Rami Malek was best known as the star&nbsp;of TV’s Mr. Robot, but he was confirmed this week for a major role in one of Hollywood’s most lucrative film franchises. Malek is now in final negotiations to star in the upcoming James Bond film, which will be Daniel Craig’s fifth outing as 007.&nbsp;He will play the film’s main villain, who is believed to have roots in North Africa, due to both his Egyptian heritage and that of&nbsp;the previous actor in talks for the role, Said Taghmaoui, who is Moroccan. Malek is the first new actor to be announced to join the franchise, with Spectre co-stars Ralph Fiennes (M), Naomie Harris (Moneypenny), Lea Seydoux (Madeleine Swann), and Ben Whishaw (Q) expected to return. Cary Joji Fukunaga (Jane Eyre, Beasts of No Nation,&nbsp;season 1 of&nbsp;True Detective) will direct James Bond 25, which is scheduled for release on April 8, 2020 (with no current competition). Rami Malek will also voice Chee-Chee the gorilla in next year’s The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle (1/17/2020), starring Robert Downey Jr. (Note: there were also stories this week that Lupita Nyong’o was sought to co-star as the next “Bond girl,” but her team reportedly said, “it won’t work out with her.”)Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;EMILY BLUNT AND THE KID ACTORS RETURNING FOR A QUIET PLACE SEQUEL(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer/Paramount)Last year’s horror hit A Quiet Place lost its one chance at an Academy Award (Sound Editing) to Bohemian Rhapsody, but this was still a big week for that film’s legacy, Oscar&nbsp;or not. Actor-turned-director John Krasinski took to his Instagram&nbsp;to announce that the Quiet Place sequel is now scheduled for just a little over two years after the first film, on May 15, 2020. That puts A Quiet Place 2&nbsp;within a week either way of Fast and Furious 9, Legally Blonde 3, the Scooby-Doo reboot, the third SpongeBob SquarePants movie, and the World War II film Greyhound. It’s currently unclear whether John Krasinski will return to act in the sequel, but he will at least direct, as he did with the first movie. Emily Blunt and the kid actors Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe are all in talks to reprise their roles, which confirms that the sequel will continue their stories (instead of revolving around&nbsp;another family).2.&nbsp;YORGOS LANTHIMOS&nbsp;ADAPTING 1960S CRIME NOVEL NEXT(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)This year’s Academy Awards ultimately didn’t work out for director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster), as The Favourite (Certified Fresh at 94%) lost in all but one of the categories in which it was nominated for an Oscar (the exception being Olivia Colman’s Best Actress win). Lanthimos remains, however, an awards darling (The Favourite did win seven BAFTAS,&nbsp;for example), so many are awaiting his next film. Lanthimos has switched genres with each film, and we learned this week that he’s following his 18th century costume drama with an adaptation of a 1960s crime novel, as he is signed to write and direct&nbsp;a&nbsp;film based on the novel&nbsp;Pop. 1280 by Jim Thompson (The Grifters, The Getaway), who co-wrote Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory.&nbsp;Pop. 1280&nbsp;tells the story of a “corrupt sheriff of a small town [who] manipulates the people in his orbit in order to win the next election.”&nbsp;The film&nbsp;is described as a “high priority” and likely Yorgos Lanthimos’ next film as director.3.&nbsp;GLENN CLOSE IS READY FOR HER CLOSE-UP IN THE SUNSET BOULEVARD REMAKE(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics)In addition to her career as an actress in film&nbsp;(Dangerous Liaisons, Fatal Attraction, 101 Dalmatians) and on television (Damages, The Shield), Glenn Close has also had great success on stage. Going into this week’s Academy Awards, Close&nbsp;was considered by many pundits to be the front runner for the Best Actress trophy&nbsp;(which ultimately went to Olivia Colman and The Favourite) for her work in The Wife.&nbsp;Now it&nbsp;appears she’s close to moving on to one of her dream projects, a film version of the stage musical adaptation of Billy Wilder’s 1950 classic Sunset Boulevard (Certified Fresh at 98%), for which she previously won won one of her three Tony Awards. Tony-winning choreographer Rob Ashford is now attached to direct Sunset Boulevard, in what will effectively be his feature film debut as director. Paramount Pictures is reportedly planning to start production on Sunset Boulevard in the fall of 2019. In a similar vein, Fox Searchlight is now developing a remake of the 1991 thriller Sleeping with the Enemy, starring Julia Roberts.4.&nbsp;MAHERSHALA ALI TO LEAD SCI-FI DRAMA SOVEREIGN(Photo by Universal Pictures)Three of the acting winners in this year’s Academy Awards were also first time nominees (Olivia Colman, Regina King, and Rami Malek), and Mahershala Ali won his second Academy Award for Supporting Actor&nbsp;for his role in Best Picture-winner&nbsp;Green Book. Like Malek, Ali’s agents were also able to convert the win into a major new role this week. Mahershala Ali is now signed to star in the science fiction drama Sovereign for director Marc Munden&nbsp;(who’s directed episodes of Utopia, Conviction, and Vanity Fair). The details of the screenplay by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods (co-writers of A Quiet Place) aren’t being revealed in detail, but the tone is described as being similar&nbsp;to Denis Villeneuve’s&nbsp;Arrival.5. THIS WEEK IN KIDS MOVIES: PUSS IN BOOTS 2, HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 4, CLIFFORD THE BIG RED DOG(Photo by Paramount Pictures)This was a big week for kids’ movies, with two big sequels confirmed to be moving forward in development. Like many other stories this week, the first is directly related to one of this year’s big Academy Awards winners. Sony Pictures scored a rare non-Disney Best Animated Feature win for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and one of that film’s co-directors is now signed for a new film. Bob Persichetti, who worked on 2011’s Puss in Boots, is now signed to direct the sequel Puss in Boots 2 for DreamWorks Animation. DreamWorks is also adapting a new Shrek movie&nbsp;(with the original cast). Meanwhile, Sony Pictures is now at work on the animated sequel Hotel Transylvania 4, which the studio has dated for December 22, 2021 (up against the Wicked movie). Lastly, Paramount has also scheduled their long-in-development adaptation&nbsp;of Clifford the Big Red Dog (likely to be a live action/animation hybrid) for November 13, 2020 (Rugrats was scheduled for that date, but that has now been pushed back two months to January 29, 2021).6. JORDAN PEELE FINDS HIS NEW CANDYMAN: BLACK MANTA FROM AQUAMAN(Photo by Warner Bros.)Director and producer Jordan Peele is definitely making the most of the success of his 2017 psychological thriller Get Out (Certified Fresh at 98%). As director, Peele has Us coming out on March 22nd, and as producer and host, he’s also got the reboot of The Twilight Zone coming soon. Another top priority for Peele is the reboot of the 1992 franchise-launching horror film&nbsp;Candyman (Fresh at 73%). Ever since the reboot was announced, the most obvious question was who would be taking over the role from Tony Todd. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who played the villain Black Manta in Aquaman, is now in talks with MGM to star in the Candyman reboot. The new Candyman is being described as a “spiritual sequel” set in “the now-gentrified section of Chicago where the Cabrini-Green housing projects once stood.” MGM has scheduled Candyman for June 12, 2020 (the week after Wonder Woman 1984). In related news, Warner Bros. has now scheduled Aquaman 2 (in which Mateen may return as Black Manta) for December 16, 2022, which is five days shy of four years after the first film (and also a “gap year” for James Cameron’s Avatar franchise after Avatar 2 in 2021 and Avatar 3 in 2022).7. TYRESE GIBSON TO STAR IN SOUL SINGER BIOPIC(Photo by Matt Kennedy/Universal Studios)According to this column this week at The Wrap, the biopic genre overtook “original content” in the 2010s as the best route for actors to win Academy Awards. The wins for Olivia Colman as Queen Anne in The Favourite and Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody clearly reflect&nbsp;this trend. We can expect Hollywood to keep producing biopics (or similarly, “true stories”) for that reason, and two such projects moved forward this week. Warner Bros. has acquired the life rights&nbsp;to R&amp;B singer-songwriter Teddy Pendergrass, to be produced by Lee Daniels (The Butler, Precious, TV’s Empire). Tyrese Gibson, one of the stars of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, is already attached to star as Pendergrass, whose record-breaking career was brought to a (temporary) halt following a near-fatal car accident that left&nbsp;him paralyzed. Like Bohemian Rhapsody, Pendergrass’ biopic may also have an emotional Live Aid segment, as that same event was where Pendergrass made his comeback performance (which you can watch right here). Another biopic that made the news this week&nbsp;was Live in Motion, which will tell the true story of African American ballet dancer Misty Copeland. Live in Motion will be directed by Nzingha Stewart, of TV’s Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy.8.&nbsp;JOSH BROLIN&nbsp;AND&nbsp;PETER DINKLAGE TO STAR&nbsp;IN TWINS-STYLE COMEDY(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)The 1980s and 1990s were an era rife with “high-concept comedies” like 1988’s Twins (Rotten at 37%), in which Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito played long-lost twin brothers. Schwarzenegger has been talking for a while now about a sequel to be called Triplets that would introduce Eddie Murphy to the mix, but now Triplets (if it ever happens) has competition. Avengers: Infinity War co-stars Josh Brolin (Deadpool 2) and Peter Dinklage (HBO’s Game of Thrones) are now attached to star in a comedy&nbsp;called Brothers, in which they will play “unlikely brothers” in a scenario compared to Twins. The Brothers screenplay is now being written by screenwriter Etan Cohen (co-writer of Tropic Thunder, Men in Black 3), who is coming off the Golden Raspberry “winner” Holmes &amp; Watson (Rotten at 10%).Rotten Idea1. ESCAPE ROOM&nbsp;SEQUEL SCHEDULED FOR 2020(Photo by Columbia courtesy Everett Collection)The first two months of 2019 have been relatively soft in box office numbers, though those numbers are likely to start rebounding next weekend with Captain Marvel. One of the films that have managed relative success in this downturn climate has been Sony Pictures’ horror/thriller film Escape Room (Rotten at 47%), which has earned over $118 million globally, and is currently the year’s #9 box office hit. Sony Pictures is moving forward with plans for Escape Room 2, which will be written, directed, and produced by the same creatives as the first film. Sony has already picked a release date for Escape Room 2 on April 17, 2020, which puts it right up against another sequel, Trolls World Tour.Like this?

ABRAMS CASTS KERI RUSSELL IN STAR WARS: EPISODE IX(Photo by Eli Winston/Everett Collection)Production is scheduled to start in just a few weeks on next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX, but until today, the film had not yet received any new casting news. Obviously, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi both introduced new characters and actors, but those movies also dispatched with some of those as well. J.J. Abrams is returning to direct the ninth episode (after also directing Star Wars: The Force Awakens), and for his first new star, he&nbsp;went back, way back, to his roots. Keri Russell, who starred as TV’s Felicity, which was J.J. Abrams’ first brush with success, has signed on for a role that “calls for action-heavy fight scenes.” We don’t know yet anything else about Russell’s role, but one can guess that the fight scenes might involve melee fighting more than just making pew-pew-pew sounds. Star Wars: Episode IX is scheduled for release next year on December 20th, 2019, which puts it within a week either way of Jumanji 3 (title pending), Sony’s Masters of the Universe, and the Agatha Christie mystery Death on the Nile (Kenneth Branagh’s sequel to Murder on the Orient Express).Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;MERYL STREEP, EMMA STONE, AND LADY BIRD STARS ALL UNITING FOR LITTLE WOMEN(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)One of the biggest stories coming out of last year’s awards season was the underdog success of actress-turned-director Greta Gerwig’s semi-autobiographical Lady Bird&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 99%) starring Saoirse Ronan and co-starring Timothee Chalamet (whose Call Me By Your Name also did well). For her next film, Gerwig is turning to classic literature in the form of Little Women. Louisa May Alcott’s novel has been adapted frequently throughout Hollywood history, but the most recent major version was the 1994 film starring Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes, and a very young Kirsten Dunst. Greta Gerwig is attracting some major star power for her version, with Meryl Streep and Emma Stone both in talks, as well as her Lady Bird stars Ronan and Chalamet. Who’s playing who isn’t clarified yet, but the producers will reportedly next test some young actresses for the role of Beth against Emma Stone (suggesting she’s playing Jo or Meg). There’s no release date for Little Women right now, but a late 2019 “awards season” release seems likely.2.&nbsp;IDRIS ELBA TO ANTAGONIZE HOBBS AND SHAW IN FAST AND FURIOUS SPINOFF(Photo by Michael Gibson/STX Entertainment)The Fast &amp; Furious spinoff starring Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham as Hobbs and Shaw ostensibly has a lot of star power even just with those two leads, but the project added another popular name this week. Idris Elba, who appears to now be done as Marvel’s Heimdall, is in advanced talks to play the Fast &amp; Furious spinoff’s villain. Hobbs and Shaw will be directed by David Leitch, who’s coming off a string of box office and critical successes&nbsp;with Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde, and John Wick (which he co-directed). The news about Idris Elba joining Hobbs and Shaw came in the same week in which we also learned that BAFTA winner Vanessa Kirby (who played Princess Margaret in The Crown) will also co-star in the spinoff. Universal Pictures will release Hobbs and Shaw on July 26th, 2019, which is the weekend after Disney’s remake of The Lion King.3.&nbsp;THIS IS US AND LADY BIRD&nbsp;STARS TEAM UP&nbsp;WITH&nbsp;IT COMES AT NIGHT DIRECTOR(Photo by Priscilla Grant, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)If you saw last year’s atmospheric post-apocalyptic thriller It Comes at Night, your immediate reaction may not have been, “I bet this guy directs a musical next.” If you had thought that, you would’ve been eerily precognitive, because that’s exactly what director Trey Edward Shults is preparing to film in August. The movie will be called Waves, and two of the film’s leads will be Emmy winner Sterling K. Brown (This is Us, The People vs O.J. Simpson) and Academy Award nominee Lucas Hedges (Manchester by the Sea, Lady Bird, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri).&nbsp; Waves is described as a “a coming-of-age tale that tells two contrasting teen love stories, focusing on both suburban teenagers and their parents,” and also a musical drama with a score by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Lucas Hedges’ next film, Boy Erased, has been scheduled for release for November 2, 2018, as part of the awards season.4. PACIFIC RIM PRODUCERS TARGETING CLASSIC ANIME SERIES GUNDAM(Photo by Nippon Sunrise courtesy Everett Collection)The Pacific Rim franchise is probably done after a grand total of two movies, following the disappointing $59 million domestic take of this year’s Pacific Rim: Uprising. That does not, however, mean that the franchise’s production company, Legendary Entertainment, is necessarily getting out of the “giant mecha” movie business. There are plenty of popular mecha franchises, especially when one considers other markets like Japan. Legendary announced yesterday at the Anime Expo in Los Angeles that they are partnering with Gundam producers Sunrise on a live action Gundam movie. There are no directors, writers, or actors to report on yet, or specific story details, except the general Gundam premise, which is that it’s “set in an era in which humanity’s growing population has led people to emigrate to space colonies. Eventually, those living in colonies seek autonomy, and launch a war of independence against the people living on Earth.” Except, of course, that premise leaves out the giant robots, which is sort of like forgetting to mention that there’s a giant lizard in Godzilla. This Gundam news came within days of Legendary Entertainment securing a new $1 billion financing deal. We live in a time where filmmakers use their money really, really wisely.5.&nbsp;NICOLAS CAGE TO VOICE SPIDER-MAN (NOIR) IN INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE(Photo by Patti Perret/Alchemy)In addition to the live-action Spider-Man movies starring Tom Holland, Sony Pictures also has the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which focuses on Miles Morales (AKA Ultimate Spider-Man), and his encounters with the larger universe of alternate Spider-people. We’ve already known for a while that Hailee Steinfeld is going to be voicing Spider-Gwen, and this week, we learned of another bit of awesome voice casting. Nicolas Cage has long been known&nbsp;for his desire to appear&nbsp;in superhero movies (for one thing, the dude named himself after Luke Cage), including Tim Burton’s never-made&nbsp;Superman Lives, a couple of films as Marvel’s Ghost Rider,&nbsp;a role in the&nbsp;Kick-Ass movies, and voicing Superman in this summer’s Teen Titans Go! To the Movies. He can now add another notch to his utility belt, as he will provide the voice of “Spider-Man Noir,” who is sort of like a spider-themed take on Rorschach from Watchmen. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse swings into theaters this December 14th, 2018.6. WHIPLASH STAR MILES TELLER TO BE MENTORED BY TOP GUN: MAVERICK(Photo by Warner Bros.)The Top Story in last week’s Ketchup&nbsp;was the news that three young actors were up for the role of Goose’s son in next year’s sequel, Top Gun: Maverick. At the time, two of the candidates were Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy, Mad Max: Fury Road) and Glen Powell (Hidden Figures, Everybody Wants Some!!), but&nbsp;it actually went to Miles Teller instead. The star of Whiplash and The Spectacular Now will play the son of Anthony Edwards’ character Goose,&nbsp;and he will be&nbsp;mentored by Tom Cruise’s Maverick. Paramount Pictures has scheduled Top Gun: Maverick for next summer on July 12th, 2019, which puts it a week after the sequel Spider-Man: Far From Home, and the week before Disney’s remake of The Lion King.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3.&nbsp;CHUCKY WILL BE YOUR FRIEND ‘TIL THE END: CHILD’S PLAY IS GETTING REBOOTED(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Many genres (romantic comedies, for example) are arguably on a downswing nowadays, but one that is doing just fine is horror. Hollywood especially likes horror because they can generally be produced relatively cheaply, meaning more profit when they are hits (IT, for example, earned $700 million from a budget of $35 million). We’re obviously getting plenty of original horror films (Hereditary, A Quiet Place, etc), but studios also see an opportunity to revive old properties. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the original Child’s Play, which introduced the killer doll Chucky, who went on to star in six more movies (most recently, as direct-to-video). MGM has announced plans to hit the reset button on Chucky with a new Child’s Play, which will be helmed by the director of the not-yet-released horror film Polaroid. The screenplay is being written by one of the writers of Kung Fury 2, and the producers’ credits include last year’s aforementioned IT remake. The&nbsp;details of the story haven’t yet&nbsp;been confirmed, such as whether the Chucky doll will be “new” in the reboot or, say, an implied revival of a classic toy. If it’s a true reboot, some writers are already pointing out the legacy downsides.2.&nbsp;PAGING DR. ROBOTNIK: JIM CARREY JOINS SONIC THE HEDGEHOG(Photo by Hopper Stone/Universal Pictures)Despite the continuing streak of Rotten Tomatometer scores for video game adaptations, Hollywood producers continue to make them&nbsp;and are able to attract major stars (or at least, former major stars). Perhaps they figure that, by this point, the laws of probability favor an eventual good movie surfacing, or maybe they just like making&nbsp;really bad ones (someone has to keep future MST3K casts stocked with material). Paramount is currently preparing their adaptation of SEGA’s popular Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, with James Marsden and Tika Sumpter already cast (in live-action roles, since&nbsp;Sonic will be CGI). Besides Sonic himself, one of the film’s biggest roles will be the villain, Dr. Ivo “Eggman” Robotnik, and now we know that he will be played by Jim Carrey. Carrey obviously has experience playing villains, which in the past has included the Riddler (Batman Forever), Count Olaf (A Series of Unfortunate Events), and the Grinch (in Ron Howard’s live-action film). Paramount has scheduled Sonic the Hedgehog for release next year on November 15th, 2019, where it will go up against Melissa McCarthy’s Christmas comedy&nbsp;Margie Claus (and a week later, the next Terminator movie).1. SCARLETT JOHANSSON STIRS UP TWITTERVERSE OVER RUB &amp; TUG(Photo by Jasin Boland/Paramount Pictures)One of last year’s biggest box office bombs (relative to budget, especially) was the live-action remake of Ghost in the Shell, starring Scarlett Johansson as “The Major,” which many people felt represented a prime example of “whitewashing” a role originally intended to be of Asian heritage. Following that, one&nbsp;could have assumed that Johansson might choose not to&nbsp;work with director Rupert Sanders again, or that she would try to avoid potentially controversial roles (cultural appropriation, etc). Yeah, both of those assumptions would have been way off. Johansson and Sanders are reuniting for a biopic called Rub &amp; Tug about the life of Dante “Tex” Gill. So, why is that controversial? Dante “Tex” Gill was born as Jean Marie Gill, but identified as a man later in life when he “became the crime kingpin of 1970s Pittsburgh through [his] empire of illicit massage parlors and an anabolic steroids ring that helped fuel the Pittsburgh Steelers’ NFL dynasty, all the while cross-dressing and leaning on [his] allies in the gay community to help grow [his] empire.” The reactions and backlash were quick and frustrated, especially from trans actors who saw this as a role that one of their own should have had the chance to own. Scarlett Johansson responded to the criticisms, saying, “Tell them that they can be directed to Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto, and Felicity Huffman’s reps for comment.” Rub &amp; Tug will be director Rupert Sanders‘ third film, following Snow White and the Huntsman (48%) and Ghost in the Shell (44%).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"TCA, Awards, Arrowverse, John, Watching, Fantasy, SundanceTV, potter, indiana, SXSW, on, Television, the, Hear, demand","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/06155359/Keri-Russell-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"keri-russell-joins-star-wars-episode-ix-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509180963126","title":"Sequel to A Quiet Place Officially in the Works, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sequel to A Quiet Place Officially in the Works, and More Movie NewsTarantino, Downton Abbey, and Episode IX cast up; Dwayne Johnson's Kamehameha project a go; Thor goes to Bangladesh; and Alec Baldwin isn't joining Joker.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 31, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Crazy Rich Asians 2, Dora the Explorer, Top Gun: Maverick, and Wonder Woman 1984.This WEEK’S TOP STORYAUDIENCES WILL SNEAK BACK TO A QUIET PLACE 2 IN 2020(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer/Paramount Pictures)Paramount Pictures announced new release dates in the summer of 2020 for two of its highest profile sequels this week, and the “takeaways” for both couldn’t be more different. Let’s start with A Quiet Place 2 (title pending), the sequel to this year’s surprise hit science fiction thriller. Almost immediately, it was clear that Paramount was going to want to return to that film’s premise (monsters that are super sensitive to sound), given that it made over $332 million from a $17 million budget. A Quiet Place 2 is now scheduled for release on May 15, 2020, which puts it up against Warner Bros’ Scooby reboot, and the week before another monster movie, Godzilla vs Kong (also from Warner Bros). The more surprising news is that Paramount has also bumped Top Gun: Maverick back nearly a full year from July 12, 2019 to June 26, 2020. The reason is reportedly to give the sequel’s “complex flight sequences” more time to be produced. Since Top Gun: Maverick is currently filming, that means there will be nearly two years between the earliest footage and the film’s actual release. Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, Miles Teller, and Jennifer Connelly will be going up against Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical&nbsp; In the Heights, as well as an untitled Marvel movie from Fox on June 26, 2020.Fresh Developments1. QUENTIN TARANTINO CASTS HIS CHARLES MANSON (AND SO DOES NETFLIX)(Photo by Francois Duhamel/Weinstein Company)It’s been about a year now that we’ve known about Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, dating back to last summer when we didn’t have a title yet. At first, we knew only that it was set in Los Angeles in the summer of 1969, and that the story would somehow implement the Manson Family murder of Sharon Tate. Since then, it’s been clarified that Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are playing a western TV actor and his stuntman best friend, respectively, with the rest of the ensemble cast to include Al Pacino, Burt Reynolds, Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning (as Squeaky Fromme), and Margot Robbie (as Sharon Tate). Last week, we learned that Lena Dunham has been cast as Manson associate Catherine “Gypsy” Share, but still hadn’t heard about the casting of Manson himself, or Tate’s husband, Roman Polanski. We can now report that Australian actor Damon Herriman will portray Charles Manson (who, coincidentally was played in 2004’s Helter Skelter by Herriman’s Justified co-star Jeremy Davies). Strangely enough, in the same week, director David Fincher also cast Herriman to play Charles Manson in the second season of Netflix’s Mindhunter. We also now that Roman Polanski himself will be played by Polish actor Rafal Zawierucha. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is scheduled for release on July 26, 2019 (two weeks before the massacre’s 50th anniversary).2. HARRY POTTER ACTRESS AMONG THE NEW DOWNTON ABBEY RESIDENTS(Photo by Warner Bros.)The popular British series Downton Abbey&nbsp;had a large ensemble cast, but as the&nbsp;big screen adaptation&nbsp;prepares to begin filming, the cast has grown even more. The most famous new cast member is probably Academy Award nominee Imelda Staunton, who co-starred as Dolores Umbridge in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&nbsp;and starred as the title character in 2004’s Vera Drake. Staunton will be joined by Simon Jones (the original Arthur Dent from the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy mini-series), Geraldine James (Anne with an E), David Haig (Penny Dreadful), Tuppence Middleton (Sense8), Kate Phillips (Peaky Blinders), and Stephen Campbell Moore&nbsp;(The Bank Job). These names come to us without any indication of their roles, but you can probably imagine that they will play either new staff members at Downton Abbey, or various members of the upper classes (because it’s Downton Abbey). The Downton Abbey movie will be directed by four-time series director Michael Engler, who is replacing the previously announced Brian Percival. Downton Abbey doesn’t have a release date yet, but sometime in late 2019 seems most likely.3. DWAYNE JOHNSON’S KAMEHAMEHA BIOPIC THE KING MAY BE CROWNED SOON(Photo by Ron Phillips/Warner Bros.)Back&nbsp;when Dwayne Johnson was still known as Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and made his feature film debut in The Mummy Returns, he was already talking up a dream project that we have yet&nbsp;to see happen. Johnson, whose mother is Samoan (making him part of a long-running wrestling family), has long wanted to star as King Kamehameha I, who was the first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaii, after the various islands of the archipelago were united in 1795.&nbsp;This week, Johnson’s production company sealed a deal with Warner Bros. for that Kamehameha I biopic to be called The King. The project also now has Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) to direct, possibly as his next film after his upcoming&nbsp;Welcome to Marwen (12/21/2018). The screenplay was also written by Randall Wallace (Braveheart), inspiring comparisons to that film about Scottish hero William Wallace (no relation). Warner Bros is expecting to start production of The King in 2020 at locations in Hawaii and New Zealand, suggesting a release in 2021. In related news, Dwayne Johnson’s producing partner confirmed this week that their Big Trouble in Little China is not so much a remake of the Kurt Russell movie as it is a “continuation” (read as “sort of like a sequel”).4.&nbsp;STAR WARS EPISODE IX RECRUITS DOCTOR WHO AND “CHARLIE” FROM LOST(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)J.J. Abrams&nbsp;continues to load up&nbsp;Star Wars Episode IX with new actors. In recent months,&nbsp;he’s recruited&nbsp;Keri Russell (star of Abrams’ TV show Felicity) and Richard E. Grant (Withnail and I, Gosford Park), as well as returning stars Billy Dee Williams and Anthony Daniels (as Lando Calrissian and C-3PO, respectively). We can now add Dominic Monaghan, who worked with Abrams on LOST (and&nbsp;played Merry in the Lord of the Rings movies). LOST wasn’t the only popular TV show that provided a new cast member, though, as Matt Smith (of both Doctor Who and The Crown) has also been cast in a “key role.” As to what roles either of the newcomers might be playing in Star Wars Episode IX&nbsp;(scheduled for December 20, 2019), it’s anyone’s guess.5.&nbsp;GUILLERMO DEL TORO CASTS MORE FOR SCARY STORIES TO TELL IN THE DARK(Photo by Kerry Hayes/Universal Pictures)Last week, we reported that producer Guillermo del Toro had begun production on his company’s adaptation of the popular Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark anthology books. The first announced cast member was Zoe Colletti (Wildlife, Annie), and this week, more of the film’s ensemble cast were revealed. As with Colletti, the cast is all made up of young up-and-comers (since the premise is about a “group of teen who must solve the mystery surrounding a wave of spectacularly horrific deaths in their small town”). They include Austin Abrams (Paper Towns), Michael Garza (Eddy in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay&nbsp; Part 1), Austin Zajur, Natalie Ganzhorn, and Gabriel Rush, who has co-starred in Wes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel. There’s no U.S. release date yet for Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, but IMDb is starting to list international dates in late 2019.6.&nbsp;AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR DIRECTORS SENDING THOR&nbsp;TO DHAKA(Photo by Hopper Stone/Warner Bros.)Directors Joe and Anthony Russo are no doubt up to their shoulders in post-production in next year’s Avengers 4. They’re also unlikely to be leaving the MCU anytime soon after that, so like many writer-directors, they are&nbsp;acting as producers on non-MCU projects (that they might have otherwise directed themselves). One&nbsp;example is an action thriller for Netflix called Dhaka (AKA the capital of Bangladesh). Dhaka will be something of an Avengers reunion project, as the lead actor will be Chris Hemsworth (Marvel’s Thor), and the director will be Sam Hargarve, a stunt coordinator who acts as Chris Evans’ stunt double on Marvel’s films. The Russos also wrote Dhaka, in which Hemsworth will play a mercenary hired to save the life of a businessman’s son. Filming of Dhaka will start in November at locations in India and Indonesia, and the extensive shoots are expected to last until March of 2019.7. CRAZY RICH ASIANS STARS REUNITE FOR SWISS ARMY MAN DIRECTORS(Photo by Sanja Bucko/Warner Bros.)2016’s Swiss Army Man&nbsp;earned a somewhat ho-hum 69% on the Tomatometer, but that was to be expected for a film with such a bizarre concept. Swiss Army Man was directed by the team called “the DANIELS” (Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan), and their next film will be an “interdimensional action movie” called Everything Everywhere At Once. For Swiss Army Man, the DANIELS recruited Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe and indie darling Paul Dano for what was basically a 95% two-person cast, and for&nbsp;Everything Everywhere At Once,&nbsp;their two leads will be co-stars from the current hit comedy Crazy Rich Asians. Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and Awkwafina (Ocean’s 8) will reunite for Everything Everywhere At Once, but the nature of their roles isn’t yet known. Both actresses are also expected to return for the already announced Crazy Rich Asians 2.8. LOONEY TUNES FAVORITE WILE E. COYOTE TO GET OWN MOVIE COYOTE VS ACME(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although it’s now been 14 years since Looney Tunes: Back in Action, over that time, we’ve occasionally heard about Warner Bros. putting other movies&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Looney Tunes characters into development. Most recently, that has included both Speedy Gonzalez and Pepe Le Pew. In the past, there had been talk about plans for an “Acme Corporation” movie, based on the fictional company frequently seen&nbsp;in Roadrunner cartoons, and that project appears to be back in development in the form of Coyote vs Acme, which, as its title suggests, is also a “solo” movie for Wile E. Coyote. Although they were called “Roadrunner” cartoons, Wile E. Coyote was frequently the actual protagonist of the shorts, as the stories centered on Coyote’s attempts to catch the Roadrunner (as opposed to the Roadrunner’s attempts to evade Coyote). It’s unknown how much of a role Roadrunner will have in Coyote vs Acme, which will be produced by The LEGO Batman Movie director Chris McKay and written by Jon and Josh Silberman (of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK1. ALEC BALDWIN’S VERY BRIEF TENURE AS BRUCE WAYNE’S DAD IN NEXT YEAR’S JOKER(Photo by NBC)Frequently, major casting news comes with the caveat that the stars in question are “in talks” or “in negotiations,” and sometimes those “talks” fall apart (typically due to scheduling or salary). What’s far less common is that the actor in question announces his non-involvement within the same calendar week. That’s exactly what happened this week with Warner Bros’ Joker origin movie and 30 Rock&nbsp;star Alec Baldwin. On Tuesday, we first heard that Baldwin had been cast as Thomas Wayne, A.K.A. Bruce Wayne’s father (curiously without any “in talks” or “in negotiations” language).&nbsp; Then, just two days later,&nbsp;he told USA Today, “I’m no longer doing that movie,” citing the aforementioned “scheduling” issues. The role had reportedly also been offered to Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen, although it’s unclear if&nbsp;it&nbsp;instead be offered to someone else. The inclusion of Thomas Wayne has led to some speculation that Joker and Bruce Wayne might actually be brothers in the movie, but that’s not been confirmed (obviously). Warner Bros has scheduled Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, for October 4, 2019.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Network, kong, Mystery, on, japanese, Spectrum, strong, on, zero, name, twilight","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/27180555/A-Quiet-Place-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"sequel-to-a-quiet-place-officially-in-the-works-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509182676284","title":"Evan Rachel Wood and Sterling K.

Brown Join Frozen 2, and More Movie NewsZombieland gets a sequel, Timothee Chalamet joins Dune, Rugrats goes live-action, and new roles for Bill Murray, Jamie Foxx, and Harrison Ford.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 20, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Dune, Frozen 2, Rugrats, and Zombieland 2. This is the first half of this Week’s Ketchup, with the second part coming on Monday, as we recap all of the news coming out of San Diego Comic-Con.This WEEK’S TOP STORYEVAN RACHEL WOOD,&nbsp;STERLING K. BROWN JOIN&nbsp;FROZEN 2(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Without a doubt, one of the most anticipated films on the 2019 release schedule is Disney’s Frozen 2, the sequel to their 2013 animated musical smash hit ($1.276 billion from a budget of $150 million). Walt Disney Pictures has been in production for&nbsp;Frozen 2 for a while now, with all three of the original voice stars returning, aiming for a release date of November 27, 2019 (a release date that no other studio has dared oppose).&nbsp; This week, we learned that Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and Josh Gad will be joined by two new characters voiced by Sterling K. Brown (TV’s This is Us) and Evan Rachel Wood (HBO’s Westwood). Walt Disney Pictures has not yet disclosed what sort of characters&nbsp;they will&nbsp;be voicing.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;LONG-LOST STANLEY KUBRICK SCREENPLAY FOUNDA surprising story that emerged early last year was that Orson Welles’ unfinished film The Other Side of the Wind will be finished and released by Netflix. Similarly, there are other directors whose unfinished works would cause quite a stir, like&nbsp;Stanley Kubrick, who died in 1999 a few months before the release of Eyes Wide Shut. The most famous of Kubrick’s unrealized projects is Napoleon, but there are several others, including&nbsp;a drama called Burning Secret, which Kubrick co-wrote in 1956 (around the time of The Killing, and before 1957’s Paths of Glory), adapting a 1913 novella by Stefan Zweig. That screenplay was long thought to be lost, until this week, when we learned that it was discovered by a British film scholar. It’s not known if any attempt will ever be made to actually realize Kubrick’s adaptation of Burning Secret.2.&nbsp;ALL FOUR STARS RETURNING TO ZOMBIELAND IN SEQUEL(Photo by Glen Wilson/Columbia courtesy Everett Collection)Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of the October 2nd, 2009 release of the genre comedy Zombieland&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 90%). We’ve heard frequent talk about a sequel in the years since, but this week, we learned it’s finally officially coming together with a filming start and release date and everything. All four of the original film’s stars (Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg, and Abigail Breslin) will return for Zombieland 2 for Sony Pictures and director Ruben Fleischer.&nbsp;The sequel will start filming in January, 2019, allowing for nine months before its release on October 11th, 2019. Zombieland 2 joins a crowded release date that currently includes Disney’s Jungle Cruise (starring Dwayne Johnson), the animated reboot of The Addams Family, Nickelodeon’s Are You Afraid of the Dark?, and the novel adaptation The Goldfinch. Ruben Fleischer’s next film before Zombieland 2 will be Marvel’s Venom (10/5/2018).3. BILL MURRAY RETURNING TO THE ZOMBIE GENRE WITH THE DEAD DON’T DIE(Photo by Fox Searchlight courtesy Everett Collection)Speaking of Zombieland, one star who won’t be returning for that sequel is Bill Murray, who (9-year-old spoiler here) appeared in a scene-stealing cameo as himself. That does not, however, mean that Murray is done&nbsp;with zombie movies. Director Jim Jarmusch (who previously worked Murray in Broken Flowers,&nbsp;Coffee and Cigarettes, and&nbsp;The Limits of Control)&nbsp;is currently filming a zombie movie&nbsp;in upstate New York called The Dead Don’t Die, and Murray is part of an ensemble cast that also includes Selena Gomez, Steve Buscemi, Adam Driver, Chloe Sevigny, and Tilda Swinton, all of whom have worked with Jarmusch before, with the exception of Gomez. Murray, Driver, and Sevigny are reportedly all playing police officers who find themselves in the midst of the zombie apocalypse.4. LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA’S DIRECTORIAL DEBUT GOES TICK TICK BOOM(Photo by Lev Radin/Everett Collection)Ever since the disastrous events surrounding the decline of The Weinstein Company, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda has made the news quite a bit because of the planned movie adaptation of his musical In the Heights. We can also report that Miranda is signed to make his film directorial debut, and surprisingly, it’s not one of the projects he’s previously worked on, on stage. Instead,&nbsp;he will direct Imagine Entertainment’s adaptation of the autobiographical musical Tick, Tick… Boom! by the late playwright Jonathan Larson. Larson is best known for writing the long-running broadway hit musical Rent, which was also adapted as a film. Tick, Tick… Boom! will be Miranda’s directorial debut in part because In the Heights will not be directed by him, but by Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians).5.&nbsp;CALL SPICE BY ITS NAME: TIMOTHEE&nbsp;CHALAMET TO STAR IN DUNE REBOOT(Photo by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom/Sony Pictures Classics)We’ve known for a while now that director Denis Villeneuve‘s latest sci-fi project after Arrival and last year’s Blade Runner 2049 was going to be a reboot of Frank Herbert’s Dune.&nbsp; Kyle Maclachlan starred as Paul Atreides in David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation of Dune, but until this week, we didn’t know who Villeneuve’s Atreides would be. That role has gone to Timothee Chalamet, who is coming off his acclaimed lead role in Call Me By Your Name, and a supporting role in Lady Bird. Dune (and its sequels) is a sprawling space opera epic with dozens of characters, but Paul Atreides is definitively the lead character, around whom the casting of Dune can now expand.6. HARRISON FORD HEARS THE CALL OF THE WILD(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although he died at the early age of 40, journalist-turned-novelist Jack London (1876-1916) left behind an impressive body of work including White Fang&nbsp;and probably his most famous novel, The Call of the Wild. The Call of the Wild has been adapted to film a few times, including in 1935 (starring Clark Gable), and in 1972 (starring Charlton Heston). That means arguably enough time has passed that we’re due for another majoradaptation, telling the story of a sled dog (and his human companion) during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush. If deals go through, the star of the new Call of the Wild will be Harrison Ford, with filming expected to start in early September. This new Call of the Wild will be directed by Chris Sanders, who is making his live-action debut after co-directing Lilo &amp; Stitch, The Croods, and How to Train Your Dragon.7. JAMIE FOXX JOINS MICHAEL B. JORDAN IN LEGAL DRAMA JUST MERCY(Photo by Warner Bros.)Michael B. Jordan is having a great 2018, coming off the runaway box office success of Black Panther, and with the Rocky spinoff sequel Creed II coming out this November 21, 2018. For his next film, Jordan will star in a smaller-scale drama, adapted from the true story book Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, written by lawyer and social justice activist Bryan Stevenson. Just Mercy tells the true story of the case of a death row inmate, with Michael B. Jordan playing his lawyer. We now know that it’s Jamie Foxx who is in talks to play the inmate. Just Mercy is looking like it might be one of Warner Bros’ contenders for awards season in late 2019.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. SCARLETT JOHANSSON DROPS OUT OF RUB AND TUG (AND WHY THAT MIGHT BE ROTTEN)(Photo by Jasin Boland/Paramount Pictures)Just two weeks ago, we learned that Scarlett Johansson had signed on to star in a true crime movie called Rub and Tug, about the life of 1970s Pittsburg crime kingpin Dante “Tex” Gill. That news led to a quick and boisterous backlash online, as people objected to Johansson playing a trans man (in conjunction with references to Gill being a “crossdressing lesbian,” and how this relates to Johansson’s role in Ghost in the Shell). To her credit, Johansson heard the objections, and within two weeks, she dropped out of Rub and Tug. Specifically, Johansson’s statement read, “In light of recent ethical questions raised surrounding my casting as Dante Tex Gill, I have decided to respectfully withdraw my participation in the project.” Hollywood’s transgender community applauded Johansson’s departure, but&nbsp;there may be a downside, as Rub and Tug&nbsp;may just be cancelled, as opposed to moving forward with a different actor in the role. Having said that, a slowdown for Rub and Tug now doesn’t mean that it won’t happen someday, or that Gill’s story might not possibly be adapted in another form.1. BELOVED 1990S CARTOON RUGRATS CRAWLING BACK AS LIVE-ACTION MOVIE(Photo by Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)They have slowed down a bit in recent years, but throughout the 1990s and 2000s, there was a steady stream of live-action movies adapted from beloved cartoon classics (The Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, Underdog, Josie and the Pussycats, etc). Many of those projects were ostensibly fueled by nostalgia, and the thing about nostalgia is that it’s not limited to just one generation. The Millennials who were kids in the 1990s are now adults, for example, and that leads us directly to Nickelodeon’s Rugrats, which ran from 1991 to 2004, and was also adapted as three animated movies (Rotten at 59%, Certified Fresh at 76%, and Rotten again at 40%, respectively). Paramount and Nickelodeon are planning a new animated TV series, and also a live-action Rugrats movie, the latter of which&nbsp;suggests, perhaps, that the Rugrats would either be CGI characters, or otherwise manipulated infant actors. Paramount has scheduled the Rugrats reboot for November 13, 2020, which is the week before Fantastic Beasts 3.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Mary, winner, Festival, Network, godzilla, Epix, Carpet","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/20201258/Evan-Rachel-Wood-Sterling-K-Brown-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"evan-rachel-wood-and-sterling-k-brown-join-frozen-2-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509182693699","title":"Jamie Foxx Will Star in Blumhouse’s Spawn, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jamie Foxx Will Star in Blumhouse's Spawn, and More Movie NewsKeanu Reeves and Angelina Jolie sign Netflix deals, Jason Momoa leaves The Crow, Andrew Lincoln leaves The Walking Dead, and Hugh Jackman wants to be a spy.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 1, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Maleficent II, Sonic the Hedgehog, Spawn, and new roles for Keanu Reeves and Hugh Jackman.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJAMIE FOXX WILL BE BLUMHOUSE’S HORROR SUPERHERO SPAWN(Photo by JA/Everett Collection, New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)In between the successful Batman movies of the late 80s/early 90s, and the first Marvel superhero hits (X-Men, Spider-Man), the genre in the 1990s actually had several&nbsp;black superheroes. This mini-trend included The Meteor Man (1993), Blankman (1994), Steel (1997), and 1998’s Blade (widely considered the first hit Marvel movie). The inspiration for 1997’s Spawn&nbsp;was a very popular comic book series (in the 1990s, anyway). Spawn was ravaged by critics (18% on the Tomatometer) and plans for a direct sequel starring Michael Jai White never came through, despite 15+ years of various forms of development.&nbsp;The character’s&nbsp;creator, Todd McFarlane, never gave up, and this week we learned that he will instead be writing and directing (as his feature film debut) a reboot of Spawn. Jamie Foxx will star in the “hard-R-rated”&nbsp;reboot, which is being produced by the horror production company Blumhouse, as their second major superhero movie, following 2016’s Split (which was a sort-of-sequel to Unbreakable). Jamie Foxx’s involvement with Spawn reportedly started with a pitch Foxx made five years ago to McFarlane. The timing for a Spawn… respawn couldn’t be more perfect, some are suggesting, following the success of Black Panther. It’s also worth noting that the new Spawn will not be an origin story, but will jump straight into Spawn‘s world.Fresh Developments1. KEANU REEVES TO NETFLIX: ALWAYS BE MY MAYBE(Photo by RADiUS-TWC)Although Keanu Reeves just recently started filming John Wick 3, his agents have already secured his next project, which will be a supporting role in a Netflix comedy called Always Be My Maybe. Ali Wong (TV’s American Housewife) and Randall Park (TV’s Fresh Off the Boat) will star as “childhood sweethearts who have a falling out and don’t speak for 15 years [who then] reconnect as adults” in San Francisco. Other co-stars will include Daniel Dae Kim (LOST, Hawaii Five-0), Charlyne Yi (Paper Heart), and Karan Soni (Dopinder the taxi driver from the Deadpool movies). The other big Netflix movie to make casting news this week was The King, an adaptation of the life of the future King Henry V (Timothee Chalamet) (with Joel Edgerton already cast as his friend Falstaff). This week’s cast additions include Robert Pattinson (Twilight, The Lost City of Z), Sean Harris (Mission: Impossible: Fallout), Ben Mendelsohn (Ready Player One, next year’s Captain Marvel), and Lily-Rose Depp (Yoga Hosers).2. HUGH JACKMAN MAY ADD ANOTHER GENRE TO HIS FILMOGRAPHY WITH THE GOOD SPY(Photo by 20th Century Fox courtesy Everett Collection)Like many A-list movie stars, Hugh Jackman has starred in movies across several different genres, including musicals (Les Miserables, The Greatest Showman), fantasy (Pan, Rise of the Guardians), animated animals (Happy Feet, Flushed Away), and, of course, superheroes. If this week’s news goes forward, Jackman will also soon be starring in a movie based on a true story of international espionage, as he and director Baltasar Kormakur (2 Guns, Everest) are currently circling a project called The Good Spy, based on a biographical book by Kai Bird about CIA operative Robert Ames. At the height of his career, Ames was the lead analyst for the Middle East in the 1970s and 1980s, and reportedly was the first agent to infiltrate the PLO, before his death in 1983 when a suicide bomber attacked the U.S. embassy in Beirut. Baltasar Kornakur’s latest film is Adrift (68% on the Tomatometer), starring Shailene Woodley, which opens in theaters this week.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK7. DISAPPOINTING BOX OFFICE FOR SOLO&nbsp;ALREADY IMPACTING FUTURE PLANS(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)The nine previous (live action) Star Wars movies set the box office standard&nbsp;so high that when Solo: A Star Wars Story “only” made $103 million over the Memorial Day weekend, box office pundits quickly labeled the film a bomb. The possible reasons for the lower turnout will be diagnosed for months to come, but one possible answer sure to be immediately addressed was the decision to release two Star Wars movies (the other being Star Wars: The Last Jedi) just five months apart. Some are also speculating that this may nix any plans for a direct Solo sequel, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Lucasfilmn won’t use the two remaining movies Alden Ehrenreich is signed for. Just last week, we learned that Boba Fett is now in development, and certain character references in Solo: A Star Wars Story did hint at how Solo, Chewbacca, and Boba Fett could meet up in a standalone film dedicated to the popular bounty hunter (not to mention&nbsp;the possibility of Lando: A Star Wars Story). As for Solo&nbsp;screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan, he signed with Amazon Studios this week to adapt the very-non-Star-Wars life story of Anita Bryant, the pop singer-turned-anti-gay-rights-activist who Gen Xers might know best for her orange juice commercials.6. JASON MOMOA DROPS OUT OF THE CROW REBOOT(Photo by Warner Bros.)Probably about 75% of the movies you hear about each week in film development news actually will result in a movie that will be in theaters within three years. The other 25% are either movies you will never ever hear about again, or they’re movies stuck in perpetual “development hell.” We’ve been reporting on the reboot of The Crow&nbsp; for several years, as potential new “Eric Dravens” come and go.&nbsp;Aquaman&nbsp;star Jason Momoa actually has been attached to The Crow for a while now; that is, until this week. Momoa and director Corin Hardy have both exited the reboot of The Crow amidst rumors that Sony Pictures may also be dropping the project as well. That last part is not yet confirmed, but if it happens, that means The Crow will be leaving its planned release date of October 11, 2019. That would be good news for its competitors on that date, which include Warner Bros’ The Goldfinch (starring Ansel Elgort), the animated reboot of The Addams Family, and the kid-friendly horror movie, Are You Afraid of the Dark?5. THIS WEEK IN ANGELINA JOLIE: MALEFICENT II STARTS FILMING, AND NETFLIX BECKONS, COME AWAY(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Walt Disney Pictures announced this week that production is underway in England on Maleficent II, the sequel to their&nbsp;2014 hit (50% on the Tomatometer), itself a live-action&nbsp;retelling of Disney’s animated classic Sleeping Beauty. Michelle Pfeiffer, Chewitel Ejiofor, and Ed Skrein are all joining the cast with the sequel, in which Maleficent must align with Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning) to protect the “moors” against evils new and old. Walt Disney Pictures has not yet scheduled Maleficent II, but it will probably be sometime in 2019 or 2020. Angelina Jolie is also the newest star to ink a deal at Netflix, as she and David Oyelowo will star in a live-action fantasy called Come Away. The movie acts as a prequel to both Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland, reimagining them as brother and sister, and depicting their lives before they went on their separate adventures; Jolie and Oyelowo will play their parents. Come Away will be directed by Brenda Chapman, the director of Pixar’s animated fantasy Brave.4.&nbsp;SEASON NINE WILL BE THE END OF THE ROAD FOR RICK ON THE WALKING DEAD(Photo by Gene Page/AMC)Robert Kirkman’s popular zombie apocalypse comic book series The Walking Dead now stretches across 30 trade paperbacks (ie, 180 issues), and the group’s leader Rick is still in there, leading the good fight. However, it appears that will soon become another way in which the AMC TV series will differ from Kirkman’s original comics, as it is now being reported that Andrew Lincoln, who plays former sheriff Rick Grimes, will be leaving The Walking Dead after the upcoming ninth season. At the same time, Norman Reedus, who plays Daryl, is negotiating for a new $20 million deal that&nbsp;will result in him effectively becoming the show’s new lead character. You can read more here, but be aware that discussions of season nine also contain (some very specific) narrative spoilers for season eight. Season nine of The Walking Dead (which has already started filming in Georgia) is expected to premiere in mid-to-late October, 2018.3. JUSTICE LEAGUE DIRECTOR TO NEXT CONSTRUCT AYN RAND’S THE FOUNTAINHEAD(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League were not absolutely box office bombs, their performance was also muted by their Tomatometer scores. It’s only been something like 7 months since the most recent film, but in that time, we’ve heard a lot about Warner Bros’ future plans for their DC Comics properties, and one of the biggest takeaways is that Justice League director Zack Snyder is pretty much done, over, and out. That doesn’t, however, necessarily mean that Snyder won’t continue making movies for Warner Bros, where he was based as a director long before he ever&nbsp;helmed a DC Comics movie. Snyder is also apparently looking to stretch his legs into something other than “action movies,” which brings us to Ayn Rand, and The Fountainhead. He told a fan this week that The Fountainhead will indeed be his next movie as director, with his wife Deborah Snyder producing through her first-look deal with Warner Bros. The Fountainhead, which was previously adapted as a 1949 film starring Gary Cooper, will tell the story of objectivist architect Howard Roark, “who makes the choice to struggle rather than compromise his artistic vision, as he favors modern architecture over the establishment-supported traditional style.” So, yes, The Fountainhead is about architecture. Excited yet?2.&nbsp;DAVE BAUTISTA TO STAR IN COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION DOGTOWN(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Ever since Marvel Studios launched their MCU with 2008’s Iron Man, superhero movies have really taken off in a way never before seen in the 40 years since the first Superman movie. Before 2008, however, comic book adaptations were actually broader in the genres they adapted, including such movies as Men in Black, Ghost World, Hellboy, American Splendor, and Road to Perdition. Most of the new comic book adaptations we’re hearing about for the next few years still involve superheroes, but there are a few others. Dave Bautista (Marvel’s Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy) is now attached to star in a movie called Dogtown, which will be an adapation of Jason Pearson’s Body Bags comic book series. As the title suggests, Body Bags is a violent father &amp; daughter team of assassins called “Clownface” and “Panda.” Dogtown will be adapted by screenwriter Kyle Ward, who was previously credited for&nbsp;Machete Kills (28%) and last year’s Underworld: Blood Wars (21%).1.&nbsp;WESTWORLD&nbsp;STAR JAMES MARSDEN TO BE HUMAN SIDEKICK FOR SONIC THE HEDGEHOG(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Back in the 1990s, the three major video game console competitors were Nintendo, SEGA, and Sony. 25 years later, SEGA — no longer the video game giant it once was — is teaming up with Sony for a CG-animated/live action adaptation of Sonic the Hedgehog, the flagship franchise for the Sega Genesis. Sonic the Hedgehog will feature human actors&nbsp;interacting with the CGI-animated blue-furred video game star. Following some short-lived rumors about Paul Rudd, we now know that the human lead for Sonic the Hedgehog will be James Marsden. Marsden currently stars in HBO’s Westworld, but many fans may still remember him best as Wolverine’s romantic triangle foil, Cyclops, in the 2000s X-Men movies. Sony Pictures has scheduled Sonic the Hedgehog for release on November 15, 2019, up against Melissa McCarthy’s Margie Claus.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, because as a video game adaptation, the odds just aren’t on its side.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"blockbuster","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/01140047/Jamie-Foxx-Spawn-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"jamie-foxx-will-star-in-blumhouses-spawn-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509182696773","title":"Guillermo del Toro and Netflix Unite for Horror Anthology Series, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Guillermo del Toro and Netflix Unite for Horror Anthology Series, and More NewsKevin Feige teases a Kamala Khan movie, IT Chapter Two adds more cast, and new roles for Meryl Streep, Gary Oldman, Kevin Hart, and Chris Evans.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 18, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as IT: Chapter Two, Ms. Marvel, and new roles for Vin Diesel, Chris Evans, and Shailene Woodley.This WEEK’S TOP STORYNETFLIX TO LAUNCH HORROR ANTHOLOGY SERIES WITH&nbsp;GUILLERMO DEL TORO(Photo by Sophie Giraud/Fox Searchlight Pictures)Earlier this year, fresh off the Best Picture Oscar win for The Shape of Water, director, producer and screenwriter Guillermo del Toro launched his own label at Fox Searchlight (the distributor behind&nbsp;the film). Del Toro’s muscle as producer has never been stronger, and this week, he expanded his influence even farther in what was also a consolidation of his relationship with the content-thirsty streaming service Netflix. Del Toro already works with Netflix on the animated series DreamWorks Trollhunters, and this week, we&nbsp;learned he&nbsp;will also produce Netflix’s first horror anthology series (not counting the sci-fi of Black Mirror). Guillermo del Toro Presents 10 After Midnight will, as the title suggests, included ten episodes telling “personally curated stories,” some of which will be written and directed by del Toro himself. Notable past examples of the format include&nbsp;Alfred Hitchcock Presents (mysteries and thrillers) and Steven Spielberg’s 1980s anthology series&nbsp;Amazing Stories (a reboot of which was recently in development for Apple).Fresh Developments1. MARVEL STUDIOS NOW DEVELOPING FIRST MAJOR MUSLIM SUPERHERO MOVIE FOR KAMALA KHAN, MS. MARVEL(Photo by Takeshi Miyazawa/Marvel Comics)There are&nbsp;any number of explanations for the popularity this year of Marvel’s Black Panther ($1.34 billion and still counting). One thing it&nbsp;had going for it was that Marvel hired director Ryan Coogler (Creed, Fruitvale Station) to tell his own type of superhero story, and people took to it. This week, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige revealed that, “Ms. Marvel… the Muslim hero who is inspired by Captain Marvel, is definitely sort of in the works.” The character we now know as Captain Marvel (3/6/2019) herself started out as Ms. Marvel, but a few years ago, that title was passed down to Kamala Khan, an Inhuman with the ability to stretch, shapeshift, and otherwise “embiggen” (think of a cross between Mister Fantastic and Giant-Man). Kamala Khan is also a Pakistani-American teenager whose stories are richly told within the context of her relationship to both her own family and her local community of Jersey City, New Jersey. It sounds like Marvel hopes for a Ms. Marvel solo movie, but she could possibly appear first in another film, like maybe Captain Marvel 2, or the all-female Avengers project Tessa Thompson has talked about pitching (A-Force?). Already on Twitter, Riz Ahmed (Nightcrawler, The Night Of), Mindy Kaling (The Mindy Project, Ocean’s Eight), and Kumail Nanjiani (The Big Sick) have all expressed interest in working on Ms. Marvel. And in the post-Black Panther world, that sort of collaboration&nbsp;is something Marvel Studios could fully get behind, and fans have been reacting online in great numbers. In the meantime, Marvel also continues to develop their Eternals movie.2. MERYL STREEP PLANNING ANOTHER SECRET DOCUMENTS TRUE STORY, THE LAUNDROMAT(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)It was just five months ago when Meryl Streep (and Tom Hanks) starred in Steven Spielberg’s The Post (Certified Fresh at 87%), telling the true story of how The Washington Post published The Pentagon Papers&nbsp;in 1971. After earning her 21st Academy Award nomination for&nbsp;her work in that film,&nbsp;Meryl Streep has signed on for another fact-based drama about a more recent cache of documents that revealed controversial secrets. Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas are also in talks with director Steven Soderbergh&nbsp;(Ocean’s Eleven, Erin Brockovich) to star in the drama called The Laundromat. The film will be an adaptation of Jake Bernstein’s non-fiction book Secrecy World: Inside the Panama Papers Investigation of Illicit Money Networks and the Global Elite, about the Panama Papers leaked in 2015 that included 11.5 million documents revealing vast offshore funding schemes. The Laundromat does not yet have a distributor, but Netflix is reportedly a top contender.3. GARY OLDMAN TO STAR IN FLYING HORSE AS PRE-CINEMA INVENTOR(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)The somewhat secret premise behind Martin Scorsese’s 2011 children’s adventure Hugo is that Sir Ben Kingsley played Georges Méliès, the early French filmmaker most remembered for 1902’s A Trip To the Moon. Hugo revealed a surprising gap in how well the earliest years of filmmaking are covered by modern biopics (the answer: not very well). British actor Gary Oldman is particularly hot right now, coming off his Best Actor Oscar win for Darkest Hour, and this week we learned that&nbsp;he is now attached to direct and star in a historical drama called Flying Horse, about the life of 19th century photographer and inventor Eadweard Muybridge. Eadweard Muybridge is credited with being an early predecessor to the filmmaking technology of the 1880s and 1890s, with his work photographing animals (like horses) for exhibition using stop-motion. Muybridge’s life story also includes “revenge, murder, and the search for justice” after the discovery in 1872 that his wife was having an affair with a drama critic. Gary Oldman’s first film as director was 1998’s Nil by Mouth (67%).4. IT CHAPTER TWO FINDS ITS ACTORS FOR ADULT EDDIE AND STANLEY(Photo by Abel Fermin, Derek Storm/Everett Collection)Following the runaway box office succcess ($700 million worldwide) of last year’s IT, New Line Cinema is now preparing to adapt the rest of Stephen King’s novel, in which the Losers Club reunite 30 years later to finally defeat Pennywise. Jessica Chastain was the first to be cast as the adult Beverly, followed by James McAvoy and Bill Hader, who will play Bill and Richie, respectively. Two more actors were cast this week, but&nbsp;neither are quite as famous as the first three. Stanley, who inadvertently brings the Losers back together, will be played by Andy Bean, who previously had a supporting role in 2016’s Allegiant. Asthmatic Eddie will be played as an adult by James Ransone, who has a slightly higher profile, having co-starred on dramas Treme and Bosch, with a more prominent role on Low Winter Sun. New Line Cinema has scheduled IT: Chapter Two for release on September 6th, 2019.5. CHRIS EVANS JOINS DISASTER THRILLER GREENLAND(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Studios)If you were surprised to see the grizzled look Chris Evans sported in Avengers: Infinity War, it’s possible that you never saw 2014’s Snowpiercer, in which Evans had a similar “beardy” look. Snowpiercer was also an opportunity for Evans to use his time in between Marvel projects to work with an acclaimed director (Bong Joon-ho), and for one of his post-Avengers 4 projects (which already wrapped filming), he’s teaming up with another fan favorite director. Chris Evans will star in a cataclysmic natural disaster thriller called Greenland for director Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie). Evans’ other post-Avengers 4 project that already wrapped filming is&nbsp;The Red Sea Diving Resort, co-starring Haley Bennett and Sir Ben Kingsley.6. SHAILENE WOODLEY’S OKCUPID ROM-COM NO BAGGAGE(Photo by Murray Close/Summit Entertainment)We may be living in a world dominated by superhero movies and creepy horror franchises, but romantic comedies remain ever popular, and we continue to get them in various forms. One route is remakes (like the recent&nbsp;Overboard), and apparently, we now get them from written articles too, like “The Craziest OkCupid Date Ever,” published by Salon in 2013. That piece has been adapted by New Line Cinema under the title No Baggage, with Shailene Woodley attached to star. No Baggage will tell the story of a couple who meet on an online dating site and agree to share an overseas adventure through obscure and exotic destinations in Eastern Europe and Turkey.7. VIN DIESEL TO FLEX HIS ACTION COMEDY MUSCLE(Photo by George Kraychyk/Paramount Pictures)The official Fast and Furious franchise is going to come to an end on April 10th, 2020, which means that Vin Diesel is going to have a lot more time on his hands pretty soon. Although his name doesn’t come up in film development news as often as Dwayne Johnson,&nbsp;he does have a few projects percolating, like Furia (his return to the Riddick franchise), xXx 4, and of course, his&nbsp;gig&nbsp;repeating “I Am Groot” for Marvel. Those projects were joined this week by an action comedy called Muscle for STXfilms, although the actual premise is being kept “under wraps” for now. Whatever Muscle is about, STX is hoping they can turn it into a new franchise for Vin Diesel. STXfilms chairman Adam Fogelson said, “Muscle is the perfect blend of action and comedy that his millions of devoted fans around the world have come to love him for, and we believe has the potential to become his next big, signature franchise.”8.&nbsp;KEVIN HART TO REMAKE BILL COSBY COMEDY UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT(Photo by Warner Bros.)In a sort of backwards logic way, the filmographies of disgraced celebrities like Bill Cosby might actually be ideal sources for producers looking for old movies to remake. Unlike the films made by stars whose reputations are not tarnished, it’s a lot harder to make the argument that people are going to want to go back and watch old Bill Cosby movies now. Specifically, we’re talking about 1974’s Uptown Saturday Night, which featured Cosby and Sydney Poitier as friends trying to get back a stolen wallet that contains a winning lottery ticket. Will Smith has been developing a remake of Uptown Saturday Night for several years now, but now it looks like Smith himself will no longer be starring in it. Instead, Kevin Hart is now in talks to star&nbsp;in the&nbsp;remake, from a script adapted by Kenya Barris&nbsp;(ABC’s&nbsp;black-ish). It’s not yet known who will be joining Kevin Hart (though it could still be Will Smith).ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1. SNAKE EYES IS GETTING HIS OWN G.I. JOE SPINOFF(Photo by Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)The “cinematic universe” trend doesn’t seem quite as hot in 2018 as it did a few years ago, as several studios have failed in their efforts to start one.&nbsp;There are, however, still some properties where individual movies could be produced with an eye towards uniting them. We know that Paramount Pictures has been considering doing exactly that with their various Hasbro movies, which could include Transformers, ROM: Spaceknight, Micronauts, M.A.S.K., and G.I. Joe. And within that, G.I. Joe&nbsp;could be split up into individual movies for some of their more popular characters (Transformers is doing this with Bumblebee, for example, due out on December 21st, 2018). With that in mind, Paramount has hired screenwriter&nbsp;Evan Spiliotopoulos&nbsp;(The Huntsman: Winter’s War, Battle for Terra) to work on&nbsp;Snake Eyes, a solo spinoff of the G.I. Joe franchise centered on the Joes’ mute&nbsp;ninja commando. Snake Eyes is one of the most popular characters in G.I. Joe, but the two films of the current franchise are both Rotten at 35% and 29% on the Tomatometer, so we don’t hold out much hope for this one.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"aapi, Quiz, Arts, Pop, teaser, Mindy, zombie, of, Access, Trophy, 2020, shows","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/18163059/Guillermo-Del-Toro-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"guillermo-del-toro-and-netflix-unite-for-horror-anthology-series-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509184488779","title":"Steven Spielberg Teases a Future Indiana Joan, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Steven Spielberg Teases a Future Indiana Joan, and More Movie NewsGuillermo del Toro finds a studio home, The Last Starfighter gets a remake, Colin Trevorrow returns to Jurassic World, and Dwayne Johnson shuns Fast and Furious 9.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 6, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Jurassic World 3, The Last Starfighter, Ready Player Two, and Star Wars Episode IX.This WEEK’S TOP STORYSTEVEN SPIELBERG SAYS WE MIGHT GET A FEMALE INDIANA JOANNext April, Steven Spielberg is going to start filming the fifth Indiana Jones, which is expected to be Harrison Ford’s last film as his classic 1930s adventurer archaeologist, and which will be released in theaters on July 10, 2020.&nbsp;That&nbsp;invites&nbsp;questions about what the franchise will become after 2020. Will there be a new actor who reboots Indiana Jones? Will Disney and Lucasfilm just stop making Indiana Jones movies? Is there a third option? Speaking to the British tabloid newspaper The Sun,&nbsp;Steven Spielberg implied&nbsp;the answer might just be a gender change to a female Indiana Jones. Reportedly, Spielberg said, “We’d have to change the name from Jones to Joan. And there would be nothing wrong with that.” (The story as it ran in The Sun has been picked up by mainstream entertainment news outlets like The Hollywood Reporter,&nbsp;&nbsp;Deadline, and Vanity Fair so it appears that the quotes are accurate.) All of this leads to the next question: which actress currently working in Hollywood would make a good Indiana Joan? Obviously, Alicia Vikander, the new Tomb Raider (and the franchise Indiana Joan would be directly competing with), is off the table, so who else is there?Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;SNL STAR KATE MCKINNON JOINS DANNY BOYLE MUSICAL(Photo by Glen Wilson/Paramount Pictures)The 2016 reboot of Ghostbusters didn’t lead to the franchise’s revival the way those involved&nbsp;probably hoped, which also meant that a few of its stars didn’t receive the big screen career bump they might’ve otherwise received. Specifically, Saturday Night Live star Kate McKinnon remains on the periphery when it comes to feature films (this August’s The Spy Who Dumped Me is McKinnon’s next lead role). The latest creative type hopping on the Kate McKinnon bandwagon appears to be British director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire). Although it’s still true that Boyle will start filming James Bond 25&nbsp;later this year, he’s also squeezing in an untitled musical that will start filming soon. Kate McKinnon is the third talent to join the untitled musical set in the 1960s/1970s after Lily James (Baby Driver, Downton Abbey) and Himesh Patel (TV’s EastEnders).2. GUILLERMO DEL TORO LANDS NEW DEAL&nbsp;WITH STUDIO BEHIND&nbsp;THE SHAPE OF WATER(Photo by Kerry Hayes/Universal Pictures)Director Guillermo del Toro has had so many unrealized film projects that there is a Wikipedia page devoted specifically to&nbsp;the subject, and it has over 25 entries. Many of these are projects that GDT had set up at Universal Pictures, the studio behind Hellboy II: The Golden Army and Crimson Peak. One of them&nbsp;was a remake of Creature from the Black Lagoon, and when that didn’t happen, del Toro eventually made The Shape of Water for Fox Searchlight instead, and the rest is now Academy Awards history. Taking a chance on del Toro’s crazy “Beauty and the Fish-Beast” love story may have been a huge win for Fox Searchlight, where Guillermo del Toro has now signed a new production deal, which will shepherd new “genre feature content like horror and science fiction.” The first project set up under this new deal is called Antlers, about “an elementary school teacher who takes in a troubled student keeping a mysterious and deadly family secret,” from director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart, Hostiles, Black Mass).3.&nbsp;ERNEST CLINE&nbsp;ISN’T JUST WORKING ON READY PLAYER TWO, BUT ALSO READY PLAYER THREE(Photo by Warner Bros.)We’ve known since December that Ready Player One author Ernest Cline is already working on a sequel novel called Ready Player Two. Cline also talked to The Hollywood Reporter in February about his plans for Ready Player Two (without actually saying what it’s about), and the possible sequel movie that could be adapted from it. In a lengthy interview with Collider recently, Cline also discussed the possible movie plans for Ready Player Two (which he seems to think Steven Spielberg might not direct). The real news that sprung from that interview, however, is that Cline always hoped to make a trilogy, and early on registered for the rights to the Ready Player Three title. Of course, it’s impossible to guess at what Ready Player Three could be about without knowing what’s happening in Ready Player Two, but it is interesting to find out that Ready Player One is just the beginning of Wade’s adventures in The Oasis.4.&nbsp;READY PLAYER ONE STAR LENA WAITHE WANTS TO ADAPT MARY TYLER MOORE’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Warner Bros. Pictures)Last year, Master of None costar Lena Waithe made history by becoming the first African American woman to win an Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. Of course, by that point, Waithe had also already wrapped her supporting role in last weekend’s Ready Player One. That film serves to further raise Waithe’s profile, and talking to The Hollywood Reporter this week, she talked about what her dream project right now is, and the answer was perhaps surprising. Lena Waithe would like to adapt After All, the 1995 memoir and autobiography by groundbreaking 1960s and 1970s TV sitcom star Mary Tyler Moore. She said, “I don’t think people are expecting that from a black lesbian from the south side of Chicago. But, I read her autobiography more times than I can count… I feel like, I want to tell her story. That is what I want to d., I’m only concerned with doing what I want to do. I don’t want to follow a certain path. I just want to just make dope s—.”5.&nbsp;THE LAST STARFIGHTER REMAKE —&nbsp;AND SIMILARLY-THEMED&nbsp;ARMADA —&nbsp;TAKING OFF(Photo by Universal Pictures)The box office success of last week’s Ready Player One (already $241 million worldwide) is quickly having an impact on other projects. Author Ernest Cline’s second novel Armada similarly heavily involves pop culture references, and also has a premise similar to the 1984 science fiction film The Last Starfighter. In that film, an alien race uses video games to find quality pilots for recruitment in the cosmic war they’re engaged in. Want to guess what two titles moved forward in development this week? Screenwriter Gary Whitta (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) teased Twitter with concept art from a remake of The Last Starfighter that he’s apparently now working on. As for Armada, screenwriter Dan Mazeau (cowriter of Wrath of the Titans), who’s working on The Flash and a Van Helsing reboot, is also now working on that film for Universal Pictures and one of the Ready Player One producers.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4. RUMOR TIME: DID MATT DAMON TURN DOWN PLAYING THE SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING 2 VILLAIN?(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Generally, The Weekly Ketchup tries to avoid “rumors”, but every once in a while, an unconfirmed rumor seems like it might be likely enough&nbsp;to be worth reporting. This story comes from The Playlist&nbsp;(and before that, the Meet the Movie Press podcast), which reported that Matt Damon may have turned down playing one of the villains (or the villain) in the sequel to last year’s Spider-Man: Homecoming (7/5/2019). We don’t yet know which villain (or villains) will be featured in next summer’s sequel, but it’s been known for a while now that two of the long-running villains Sony wants to add to their Spider-Man movies are Mysterio and Kraven the Hunter. Damon seems an unlikely choice to play Russian villain Kraven, so it might be Mysterio he turned down. If not Mysterio or Kraven, which Spider-Man villains would you like to see featured in next summer’s sequel? Someone new, or one we’ve already seen?3. JURASSIC WORLD DIRECTOR TO RETURN FOR 2021’S JURASSIC WORLD 3(Photo by Industrial Light &amp; Magic/Universal Pictures)As dialogue in the film community has focused more and more on female representation behind the camera, one of the key subjects has been the concept of white male directors “failing upwards“, and white privilege in general. A frequent target in all of this has been director Colin Trevorrow, who landed the plum project Jurassic World after directing just one indie film, 2012’s Safety Not Guaranteed. Trevorrow did not return for this summer’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. The movie&nbsp;he directed instead was last summer’s The Book of Henry, which was both a box office bomb (just $4.5 million) and a critical failure with a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 20%. Well, guess who’s still failing upwards? Steven Spielberg has confirmed that Jurassic World 3 (6/11/2021) will be written and directed by none other than Colin Trevorrow.2. FANS WANT MERYL STREEP TO REPLACE CARRIE FISHER (AND MARK HAMILL DOESN’T)(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)In the sea of petitions that exist on the internet, every once in a while there’s one that actually stands out enough to attract mainstream attention. Currently, there is a petition that is just over 500 votes shy of its target goal calling for a Star Wars casting change, and boy, is this one a doozie. The petition calls for Lucasfilm to replace the late Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia in Star Wars Episode IX (12/20/2019) with Meryl Streep, who played a fictionalized Carrie Fisher in 1990’s Postcards from the Edge. Mark Hamill responded to a question about the petition, saying, “I think it would be tough recasting because she’s so indelibly linked to that character… They’ve already ruled out the idea of computer generating her performance like they did with Peter Cushing, so gee, that’s got to be a really, not an insurmountable problem, but … I know the script had been developed enough so when we lost her they had to go back to square one. She’s irreplaceable as far as I’m concerned.”1. DWAYNE JOHNSON MAY NOT RETURN FOR FAST &amp; FURIOUS 9 DUE TO FEUD WITH VIN DIESEL(Photo by Frank Masi/Columbia Pictures)In 2016, we first heard about possible friction between Fast &amp; Furious franchise stars Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel. Some of what we’ve heard over the last 18 months seems to&nbsp;revolve around&nbsp;the spinoff movie(s) that Johnson’s character will be receiving (along with Jason Statham), the first of which is scheduled for July 26, 2019. In a recent interview, Johnson confirmed that he did not film any scenes for the 8th film with Vin Diesel, and that he may not co-star in Fast &amp; Furious 9 either (4/10/2020).&nbsp;He cited “fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating. It took me some time, but I’m grateful for that clarity.

There have been several popular WWII comic book titles in the last 70 years (such as Marvel’s Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos&nbsp;and DC’s Haunted Tank, Weird War Tales, Sgt. Rock). Although the majority of these comics focused on the ground war, DC Comics did have success with Blackhawk, about a team of Allied pilots of different nationalities who team up for battles both in the air and in various forms of behind-enemy-lines espionage and other missions. At this point, we should note that Warner Bros has (to our knowledge) never started development of a Blackhawk movie, and that includes the period when non-superhero comic book titles were just as frequently adapted. Of course, that was before Steven Spielberg had one of his biggest box office openings ever with Warner Bros’ Ready Player One. Perhaps hoping to do for battles in the skies of World War II what Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers did for the ground war, Spielberg is indeed now producing an adaptation of DC Comics’ Blackhawk. Spielberg’s Amblin Pictures is developing the project for Warner Bros along with screenwriter David Koepp (Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), with Spielberg considering directing (but at this point, not necessarily signed to do so). Steven Spielberg’s next two films as director are expected to be the not-yet-titled Indiana Jones 5 (7/10/20), and a remake of West Side Story.Fresh Developments1. MARGOT ROBBIE’S BIRDS OF PREY SPINOFF ATTRACTS DC’S THIRD FEMALE DIRECTOR(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although 2016’s Suicide Squad was a critical flop with just a 27% Tomatometer score, the movie’s most successful breakout character was arguably Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn. In the time since Suicide Squad, we’ve heard about multiple movies involving Harley Quinn, including Suicide Squad 2, a Joker/Harley spinoff with Jared Leto, an all-DC-girls movie called Gotham City Sirens, and just a straight up solo movie for Harley Quinn. All that said, it’s now sounding like Margot Robbie’s next film as Harley Quinn will be a completely different project altogether. Warner Bros has hired Chinese-American director Cathy Yan to direct an untitled film which will be based on DC Comics’ various Birds of Prey titles. Birds of Prey has featured such female DC characters over the years as Black Canary, Catwoman, Huntress, and Oracle (the former Batgirl). Yan made her directorial debut recently with Dead Pigs, about a river in China filled with decomposing hog carcasses (Deadpool 2 star Zazie Beetz co-starred in Dead Pigs, suggesting she could possibly join&nbsp;Birds of Prey). This untitled project is expected to start filming later this year after Robbie wraps her role in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. In other Margot Robbie news, Mary Queen of Scots (in which she plays Queen Elizabeth I, with Saoirse Ronan in the title role), has been scheduled for an “awards season” date of December 7, 2018.2. FATE OF THE FURIOUS DIRECTOR TO DON HIS OWN ACTION FIGURE M.A.S.K. (MOBILE ARMORED STRIKE KOMMAND)(Photo by Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)A couple of years ago, we learned that Paramount Pictures had reached a new agreement with the Hasbro toy company for a series of movies based on toy lines like G.I. Joe, Micronauts, and ROM: Spaceknight. Since then, we’ve heard about new movement on the Micronauts and ROM: Spaceknight movies (as recently as three weeks ago, even), but one project that we haven’t heard much about is the quintessentially 1980s toy line and animated TV series&nbsp;M.A.S.K. That’s all about to change, though, as we&nbsp;can now report that Paramount Pictures is uniting with director F. Gary Gray&nbsp;(Straight Outta Compton, The Fate of the Furious). The live-action film will detail the efforts of the M.A.S.K. team, led by “Matt Trakker,” to defeat the evil criminal organization V.E.N.O.M. (Vicious Evil Network Of Mayhem). Paramount and Gray will now reportedly attempt to find “a writer to hatch a contemporary subculture movie with a youth empowerment angle.”3. SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE STARS LESLIE JONES AND COLIN JOST UNITE FOR BABY NURSE(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)In addition to his duties on Saturday Night Live since the 1970s, Lorne Michaels has also been a prolific producer of feature films starring various different alumni from the show, dating back to 1986’s Three Amigos! Michaels’ involvement has slowed down a bit in the last few years (at least from his 1990s/2000s heyday), but this week,&nbsp;his Broadway Video production company made a new deal with Universal Pictures. The first project expected to move forward under the new deal with Universal is a comedy called Baby Nurse, with current SNL stars Leslie Jones and Colin Jost both attached to star. Jones will play “a special agent assigned to the most humbling undercover role in the history of the FBI,” but it’s not yet known what Colin Jost’s role in Baby Nurse involves. It’s also worth noting that Baby Nurse doesn’t appear to have anything to do with 2008’s Baby Mama, also featuring two SNL stars (Tina Fey and Amy Poehler).4. KINGSMAN STAR TARON EGERTON CONFIRMED FOR THE ELTON JOHN BIOPIC ROCKETMAN(Photo by Giles Keyte/20th Century Fox)Paramount Pictures has given a greenlight to the long-in-development Elton John biopic Rocketman, and along with that news, we now have confirmation of who will be starring as the man himself. Tom Hardy was previously in talks for the role, but&nbsp;since he’s&nbsp;busy right now with the Al Capone movie Fonzo,&nbsp;it will instead now go to Taron Egerton, the star of the Kingsman spy action franchise. In addition to&nbsp;playing Elton John, Egerton will also be singing all of the songs in character. Rocketman will be directed by Dexter Fletcher, who directed Egerton in the ski jumping biopic Eddie the Eagle&nbsp;and also took over from Bryan Singer on the upcoming Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody (11/2/18).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK5. AMY SCHUMER MAY EXPERIMENT WITH PUGILISM AS CHRISTY MARTIN(Photo by Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures)As her new comedy I Feel Pretty neared its release this weekend, Amy Schumer was already starting to consider her next film with the same production company, Voltage Pictures. Schumer is reportedly “circling” Christy Martin, a biopic about the eponymous female boxer, whose 1989 to 2012 professional record stands at 49-7-3, with 31 of those wins by knockout. Voltage Pictures also handled the Tupac Shakur biopic All Eyez on Me. If Amy Schumer does sign on to play Christy Martin, it will be a rare dramatic role for her, as Martin’s life story includes her many personal struggles, including her then-husband’s attempted murder of her in 2010. Christy Martin is expected to be directed by Katherine Fugate, in her directorial debut after co-writing three films with Rotten scores (The Prince &amp; Me with 28%, Valentine’s Day with 18%, and New Year’s Eve with 7%). Amy Schumer is also coming off two starring roles with Rotten scores (Snatched with 36% and I Feel Pretty with 38%).4. JASON CLARKE HELPS REVIVE THE PET SEMATARY FRANCHISE IN REBOOT LEAD ROLE(Photo by Claire Folger/Showtime)Although last year’s IT reboot was expected to possibly do well, very few experts probably predicted that it would earn over $327 million domestically, and $700 million worldwide. Since then, various Stephen King projects have begun new development, but one that had a head start was the reboot of Pet Sematary, which has been in the works for a while now. We know who will be starring as the story’s lead character, a doctor whose back yard leads to an ancient burial ground, and it’s Jason Clarke, whose recent films have included Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Terminator: Genisys, and the recent Ted Kennedy drama Chappaquiddick. This Pet Sematary reboot will be directed by Kevin Kolsch&nbsp;and Dennis Widmyer, who made their directorial debuts with 2014’s Starry Eyes. Both of the original Pet Sematary films received Rotten Tomatometer scores (48% for Pet Sematary&nbsp;and 26% for its 1991 sequel). Pet Sematary is scheduled for release on April 19th, 2019, where it will currently take on the animated movies Playmobil and Spies in Disguise, and an untitled horror film.3. DISNEY FINDS VILLAINS FOR ITS MALEFICIENT SEQUEL AND THEME PARK MOVIE JUNGLE CRUISE(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Just last week, we learned that Gong Li will be playing the new villain role in Walt Disney Pictures’ live action remake of Mulan, and this week, two more of Disney’s live-action films also found their villains. First up, there was the not-yet-titled sequel to 2014’s Maleficent (the live-action Sleeping Beauty movie), starring Angelina Jolie. The villain in the sequel will be played by Ed Skrein, who relatively recently also played the villain in Deadpool, and will also play one of the villains in this year’s Alita: Battle Angel. Filming of Maleficent 2 is expected to start later this year, for a likely release in 2020. Walt Disney Pictures is also preparing for their next big theme park attraction movie, Jungle Cruise (starring Dwayne Johnson), and we now know that two of the film’s villains will be played by Edgar Ramirez and Breaking Bad costar Jesse Plemons. Maleficent received a Tomatometer score of&nbsp;50%.2. NEW TERMINATOR CYBORG IS NOT BIG AND MUSCULAR LIKE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Arnold Schwarzenegger was so synonymous with “body builder” in 1984 that when he took on the title role in The Terminator, he arguably set a standard for how muscular any future T-800 actor would need to be. (Trivia: Originally, James Cameron considered casting&nbsp;Lance Henricksen, Bishop from Aliens, as the T-800.) Well, “they” are indeed moving forward with plans for a post-Schwarzenegger Terminator reboot, and the actor cast as the new T-800 is distinctly non-Schwarzeneggerian. The cyborg role in next year’s Terminator reboot has gone to Gabriel Luna, whom Marvel fans might know as Ghost Rider from season 4 of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Gabriel Luna is American of Mexican descent, and his other new co-stars are also of Latin heritage: Natalia Reyes (Colombian) and Diego Boneta (Mexican-American). Paramount has already scheduled Terminator for November 22, 2019, which is the week after Sonic the Hedgehog and Melissa McCarthy’s Margie Claus, and five days before Disney’s Frozen 2 sequel. The last two Terminator movies were both Rotten on the Tomatometer (33% for Salvation, 26% for Genisys).1. NEW LAWSUIT MIGHT MEAN WE NEVER GET ANOTHER TRIP DOWN MAD MAX: FURY ROAD(Photo by Jasin Boland/Warner Bros.)One of the most surprising films of 2015 was the sequel/reboot Mad Max: Fury Road which won dozens of awards, including ten Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and six wins (Best Costume Design, Editing, Makeup/Hairstyling, Production Design, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing). Mad Max: Fury Road was a triumph for its director George Miller, but this week’s news suggests we may never get to see Miller return to Mad Max. George Miller is now engaged in what is being called a “bitter court battle” with Warner Bros over what Miller’s production company claims is “high-handed, insulting, or reprehensible” behavior. The financial crux of Miller’s lawsuit involves what he says were promised bonuses for bringing Mad Max: Fury Road in under budget, and for “breaching a co-financing agreement.” Miller reportedly has finished screenplays for both Mad Max 5 and Mad Max 6 for years now, but if this lawsuit over Fury Road cannot be settled amicably, it’s possible that they will never be produced.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"4/20, VICE, Winners, Pride, supernatural","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/20135729/Steven-Spielberg-Ketchup2.jpg","slug":"steven-spielberg-may-direct-dcs-blackhawk-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509184519509","title":"Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel Costume Revealed, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Brie Larson's Captain Marvel Costume Revealed, and More Movie NewsOscar noms are announced, Call Me By Your Name becomes first in a trilogy, Dr. Seuss gets a new franchise, and Clue gets a remake.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 26, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;titles such as Barbie, Captain Marvel, The Cat in the Hat, Clue, Duke Nukem, and The Incredibles 2.This WEEK’S TOP STORYBRIE LARSON’S CAPTAIN MARVEL COSTUME REVEALED(Photo by https://twitter.com/brielarson/status/757042695537774592)In the comics, Marvel’s Captain Marvel (also formerly known as Ms. Marvel, Binary, and Warbird) has had many costumes, but most of them have shared a similar color palette of red, blue, and yellow. So, most people understandably assumed&nbsp;Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel costume would be some variant on that combo, but that’s not what we saw this week as the first images emerged. As you can see here and here, Larson is sporting a version of her recent outfit, but with green and black instead. When Marvel Comics introduced their first Captain Marvel (AKA Mar-Vell) in 1967, however, his costume was mostly green and white, which,&nbsp;as this article explains, is probably why Brie Larson is wearing green, too. There appears to be some confusion about whether these images are from the sets of Captain Marvel (3/8/19) or Avengers 4 (5/3/19), but the older car in the background suggests the 1990s setting of Captain Marvel.Fresh Developments1. ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS INCLUDE SURPRISES FOR LOGAN (AND SNUBS FOR WONDER WOMAN?)(Photo by Ben Rothstein/20th Century Fox Film Corp.)The Weekly Ketchup normally focuses on the hottest news in film development, but Hollywood doesn’t get much bigger than the Academy Awards, so&nbsp;we’re inclined to cover the nominations here as well. The biggest nominee, with 13 nominations, was Guillermo del Toro’s merman romance The Shape of Water, followed by Dunkirk (8), Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (7), and 6 each for Darkest Hour and Phantom Thread. The X-Men spinoff sequel Logan also made history as the first ever superhero movie to be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay (Ghost World was the first comic book adaptation, followed by A History of Violence). Netflix’s Mudbound also made history as its cinematographer Rachel Morrison became the first woman to ever be nominated in that category. There has also been some talk that Wonder Woman not receiving any nominations after being a significant achievement last year was a major snub (or at least, a huge oversight). The 90th Annual Academy Awards will be aired on ABC on March 4, 2018, and you can keep track of awards season wins right here at the Rotten Tomatoes Awards Leaderboard.2.&nbsp;BREAKING BAD COSTAR JONATHAN BANKS JOINS THE INCREDIBLES 2(Photo by Ursula Coyote/AMC)The criteria for who makes a great casting choice for an animated movie can be wildly different than for other types of films. Obviously, star value doesn’t hurt, and neither does singing ability in many cases. Other actors, however, just have really cool voices.&nbsp;One example is Jonathan Banks, who you might recognize for his roles on TV shows like Breaking Bad (and its prequel Better Call Saul) and Community (he basically replaced Chevy Chase in Season 5). Disney and Pixar took to Twitter this week to unveil their new Incredibles 2 cast members, along with character sketches. Banks will be joined by Sophia Bush (TV’s One Tree Hill), Isabella Rossellini (Blue Velvet), Catherine Keener (The 40 Year Old Virgin), and Bob Odenkirk (also from Better Call Saul). The Incredibles 2 is scheduled for June 15, 2018, up against the Superfly remake and the movie adaptation of the playground game Tag.3. BEST PICTURE NOMINEE CALL ME BY YOUR NAME TO RECEIVE SEQUEL(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics)Currently showing in only 815 theaters, Best Picture nominee Call Me By Your Name has only earned $9 million thus far, which suggests that most movie fans have probably not yet seen the film. Even so, director Luca Guadagnino is already planning on following Call Me By Your Name with two more sequels to form his own equivalent to Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight trilogy.&nbsp;Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer starred in Call Me By Your Name as 17-year-old and 24-year-old Americans, respectively, who fall in love in rural Italy in 1983. According to Guadagnino, the sequel will be set five years later in 1988, and shift the focus more towards the height of the HIV and AIDS epidemic.4. NATALIE PORTMAN JOINS JUDE LAW IN ALL-SIA POP STAR DRAMA VOX LUX(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Paramount Pictures)In 2016, we first heard about an indie drama called Vox Lux about a pop music star that would feature a soundtrack of all-new songs performed by Sia. However, its star Rooney Mara dropped out, and so the film didn’t move forward last year. The production company also reportedly had financing issues, but a good deal at Sundance for Keira Knightley’s Colette is helping them move forward with Vox Lux. Natalie Portman is now officially signed to replace Rooney Mara as the film’s pop music title character, with Jude Law still attached as the male lead. Vox Lux “follows the rise of ‘Celeste’ from the ashes of a major national tragedy to pop superstardom. The film spans 15 years and traces important cultural moments through the singer’s eye, starting in 1999 and ending in the present day.” Filming starts on location in New York City next week.5. THE CAT IN THE HAT TO LEAD NEW FRANCHISE OF ANIMATED DR. SEUSS MOVIES(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)For the last 20-ish years, Universal Pictures has had the rights to various Dr. Seuss childrens books, which they have adapted into both live-action (How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat) and animation (Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax) movies. Universal Pictures does still have a new animated version of The Grinch (starring Benedict Cumberbatch) scheduled for this November 9th, 2018, but many other Dr. Seuss animated movies now have a new home studio. Warner Bros and their Warner Animation Group are now developing a new slate of animated Dr. Seuss movies, and it’s all going to start with a new animated adaptation of The Cat in the Hat. Netflix also has an upcoming series based on Green Eggs and Ham in the works.6. ANNE HATHAWAY’S BARBIE MOVED TO PRIME EARLY SUMMER 2020 SLOT(Photo by Giles Keyte/Focus Features courtesy Everett Collection)Once upon a time, Sony’s long-in-development Barbie movie was to have been released this coming June, but then its star Amy Schumer dropped out. Anne Hathaway subsequently signed on to replace Schumer, and the release date moved to this August. However, that plan may have always been a bit optimistic, requiring quick filming and post production to finish and release the movie within a year. Australian director Alethea Jones (2012’s indie Lemonade Stand) will now have more time to complete Barbie with (ostensibly) time to spare, as Sony has moved the release date to May 8th, 2020. Anne Hathaway will star in Barbie as someone from her “Barbie world” who is rejected because she’s not “perfect” enough. This new date puts Barbie a week after a Marvel movie (which is possibly Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3), and the week before the Scooby (Doo) reboot.7. THE CLUE MOVIE WILL BE EXECUTED BY RYAN REYNOLDS AT FOX WITH A CANDLESTICK20th Century Fox gambled big and it paid off well when they finally gave the greenlight to Ryan Reynolds and his Deadpool pet project ($783 million in global box office from just a $58 million budget). It’s for that reason that one has to imagine Reynolds is sort of a studio darling these days. This week, Fox made a three-year “first look” deal with Reynolds’ Maximum Effort production company, and part of the deal involved a high profile reboot of Clue, the cult favorite 1985 comedy based on the classic board game of the same name.&nbsp;Reynolds will play one of the classic Clue characters&nbsp;and will also produce, with the writers of Deadpool also on “board” (so to speak).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. THAT’S NOT A FAKE MOVIE, THIS CROCODILE&nbsp;DUNDEE&nbsp;SEQUEL IS A FAKE MOVIEThis year’s Super Bowl 52 is happening next Sunday, February 4th, and some people apparently forgot about that. On Friday night, a “teaser” appeared online for something called Dundee&nbsp;claiming to be a Crocodile Dundee sequel with Danny McBride as the elder Dundee’s American son. That was followed on Monday by another teaser with Australian Thor star Chris Hemsworth joining in on the fun. One popular early guess was that the Dundee videos might be leading up to a Super Bowl commercial for the Subaru Outback. By yesterday, the jig was up on the Dundee ruse, which turned out to be a viral marketing campaign for the Australian tourism board. The idea of a modern Crocodile Dundee reboot starring Danny McBride actually wasn’t horrible, so we’re calling this&nbsp;bait-and-switch&nbsp;a “Rotten Idea.”1. VIDEO GAMING LIKE IT’S 1994: JOHN CENA MIGHT STAR AS DUKE NUKEM(Photo by Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures)Movies often take a long time to make their way through development, and being based on an intellectual property sometimes doesn’t help. One type of IP that doesn’t always age particularly well are video games. There are obviously some perennial franchises (Tomb Raider, Warcraft, etc), but many others&nbsp;enjoy a few years of popularity before gamers move on. Duke Nukem is a first person shooter franchise that started in 1991 and&nbsp;stayed popular through most of the 1990s (before a 15-year&nbsp;hiatus&nbsp;that finally resulted in&nbsp;2011’s Duke Nukem Forever). Regardless, Paramount Pictures is in need of new action franchises, so we’re getting a Duke Nukem movie. Michael Bay is producing&nbsp;Duke Nukem, and his Platinum Dunes company is talking to former WWE-star-turned actor John Cena. John Cena has been both in action movies like The Marine and 12 Rounds&nbsp;and comedies like Trainwreck and (briefly) Daddy’s Home. We’re calling Duke Nukem the Rotten Idea of the Week because of the very bad Tomatometer history for video game movies.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"blockbusters, Showtime, Disney, Writers, Television, Apple, VOD, National, SundanceTV, Comedy, FX","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/26162033/Brie-Larson-Captain-Marvel-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"brie-larsons-captain-marvel-costume-revealed-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509184509264","title":"Brad Pitt Joins Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Brad Pitt Joins Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and More Movie NewsMarvel moves Avengers: Infinity War up a week, Kristen Wiig is Wonder Woman's next nemesis, Silver Surfer gets a reboot, and 9 to 5 gets a remake.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 2, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;titles such as Captain Marvel, Silver Surfer, Wonder Woman 2, and the new Men in Black spinoff.This WEEK’S TOP STORYBRAD PITT REUNITES WITH QUENTIN TARANTINO FOR&nbsp;ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD(Photo by Weinstein Company)Throughout his career, Quentin Tarantino has made “paying homage” not just the subtext, but frequently the actual text, so to speak, of his films.&nbsp;He is perhaps best known for loving exploitation films of the 1970s, but his admiration of westerns runs deep as well (see: Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight). This week, Tarantino revealed the title of his 9th film, and it’s a direct homage to Sergio Leone: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. This news also came with confirmation that Brad Pitt will be Leonardo DiCaprio’s co-star, as DiCaprio will be playing former western TV star Rick Dalton, while Pitt will play his stunt double best friend Cliff Booth. The highly publicized connection to the summer of 1969 Manson murders is that Dalton’s next door neighbor is future victim Sharon Tate. Meanwhile,&nbsp;it’s unclear if Tom Cruise is still in talks for a role. Sony Pictures will release Once Upon a Time in Hollywood on August 9th, 2019, the 50th anniversary of the murder of Sharon Tate and her friends.Fresh Developments1. MARVEL REVEALS 2021 AND 2022 RELEASE DATES, BUT WHAT MOVIES ARE THEY GOING TO BE?(Photo by Marvel Studios)Disney has made a habit of&nbsp;claiming release dates without naming specific titles. There are obvious advantages to that, both in preventing their competition from knowing their secrets and in allowing themselves development room to perhaps change plans midstream without a big fuss. Having said that, it’s still a little crazy to see how many times “UNTITLED” shows up on their release calendar. This week, Marvel added six new dates in 2021 and 2022 for UNTITLED MARVEL projects: 5/7/21, 7/30/21, 11/5/21, 2/18/22, 5/6/22, 7/29/22. Now, let’s try to figure out what some of these might actually be. First up,&nbsp;it’s worth noting that in 2020, Marvel is likely to deliver Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 (maybe on 5/1/20) and the Spider-Man Homecoming sequel (on either 7/31/20 or 11/6/20). Other likely titles, then, for 2021 include&nbsp;Doctor Strange 2 (unless that’s the 11/6/20 project), Ant-Man 3, Captain Marvel 2, Black Panther 2, Black Widow, and whatever version of Avengers will be the fifth Avengers movie (Tessa Thompson has talked about an all-female team). That still leaves us one short&nbsp;of the total six scheduled for 2021 and 2022. Could one of our other existing characters —&nbsp;Falcon? Scarlet Witch and Vision? Maybe&nbsp;Valkyrie&nbsp;or someone from&nbsp;Black Panther? — get a movie?&nbsp;Or could there be a character from the comics we haven’t seen on the big screen at all yet? Long-running Avengers not yet accounted for include Black Knight, Hercules, Spider-Woman, Namor the Sub-Mariner, and She-Hulk.2. DISNEY GIVES SOLO EXTRA SPACE – AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR BUMPED UP A WEEK(Photo by Marvel Studios)It was almost three years ago that Disney and Lucasfilm announced&nbsp;the Han Solo prequel (now known as&nbsp;Solo: A Star Wars Story) would be released on May 25th, 2018 (the 41st anniversary of the original Star Wars). However, it wasn’t until Super Bowl weekend that we saw&nbsp;the first trailer for it, possibly suggesting the movie is lagging behind schedule. Having said that, this news story is nominally about another Disney release, Avengers: Infinity War. Marvel Studios has announced that Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;will be moved up a week from May 4th, 2018 to April 27th, 2018.&nbsp;To tie it all together,&nbsp;this piece points out the synergy involved between Solo: A Star Wars Story, Avengers: Infinity War, and another Marvel film, Deadpool 2.3. KRISTEN WIIG CAST AS CAT WOMAN VILLAIN IN WONDER WOMAN 2(Photo by Wilson Webb/20th Century Fox )The continuing critical backlash and disappointing box office for DC Comics movies that aren’t Wonder Woman seemed to suggest their future films might benefit from a lighter tone. The sequel Wonder Woman 2 will start filming soon (to meet its November 1st, 2019 release date), and we now have an idea who the villain will be. Saturday Night Live alum Kristen Wiig (Ghostbusters, Bridesmaids) is now in talks with Warner Bros. to star&nbsp;as the Wonder Woman 2 villain, believed to be Cheetah. Wonder Woman does not have as famous a rogues gallery as Batman, the Flash, or Superman, but Cheetah is definitely one of her biggest nemeses. What’s as yet unclear is which version of Cheetah&nbsp;Wiig would play, as there have been several, ranging from “ladies in cat outfits” to “actual werecheetahs.” Kristen Wiig doesn’t necessarily seem lithe enough for the latter version (unless they totally CGI her), but her casting does have its supporters.4. POST-BLACK PANTHER, LUPITA NYONG’O AND VIOLA DAVIS JOIN AFRICAN AMAZONS TRUE STORY THE WOMAN KING(Photo by Linda Wheeler,Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)There are a lot of fresh themes in Marvel’s Black Panther, but one of the most groundbreaking is the emphasis on strong roles for women of color like those played by Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, and Lupita Nyong’o.&nbsp;Now, the latter is aligning with Viola Davis for a movie based on a true story which one could draw direct comparisons to the Dora Milaje of Black Panther. TriStar Pictures has acquired the rights to The Woman King, a drama inspired by the real-life events in the Kingdom of Dahomey (modern-day Benin) in the 18th and 19th centuries. Davis and Nyong’o will be the film’s stars as a mother and daughter pair, with Davis playing “general of the all-female military unit known as the Amazons, and her daughter Nawi (Nyong’o), who together fought the French and neighboring tribes who violated their honor, enslaved their people, and threatened to destroy everything they’ve lived for.”5. HAS CHRIS HEMSWORTH FOUND HIS POST-THOR FRANCHISE WITH THE MEN IN BLACK SPINOFF?(Photo by Hopper Stone/Warner Bros.)We don’t necessarily know when each of the original Avengers will make their last films for Marvel Studios, but for a few of them, we’re probably closer to the end than it might seem. After the events of Thor: Ragnarok, it’s definitely looking like Chris Hemsworth might be nearing the home stretch as the God of Thunder,&nbsp;so it shouldn’t be surprising that he’s starting to look for his next big franchise (that isn’t the Crocodile Dundee reboot for the Australian tourism board). Hemsworth is now talking to Sony Pictures about starring in their upcoming Men in Black spinoff —&nbsp;he will reportedly be joined by “a female of color and an older man,” and the movie will be a “global adventure.” The original plan had been for a crossover with 21 Jump Street, but that plan has since been scrapped. Whatever this spinoff actually is, it’s going to be directed by F. Gary Gray&nbsp;(Straight Outta Compton, The Fate of the Furious) from a script by Iron Man screenwriters Matt Holloway and Art Marcum. Sony Pictures has scheduled this untitled Men in Black spinoff for June 14th, 2019 (up against the Shaft sequel/reboot).6. MARK HAMILL TALKING OVER TWITTER ABOUT GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 3Ryan FujitaniSocial media platforms may&nbsp;frequently be annoying, but every once in a while, they can also be used as a force for good. This week, a fan on Twitter asked Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn about whether he could maybe cast Mark Hamill in the 3rd movie. That led to the revelation that they actually live near each other, and then Mark Hamill joined in, and it sounds like maybe this thing might actually happen when Marvel releases GotG Vol 3 sometime in 2020. In other GotG news (and also from Twitter), Gunn also confirmed this week that Groot actually did die in the first movie (sorry for the spoilers from four years ago), and that “Baby Groot,” a.k.a. “Teen Groot,” is actually the son of the first Groot.7. HUMANS STAR GEMMA CHAN CAST AS KREE VILLAIN MINN-ERVA IN CAPTAIN MARVEL(Photo by Momentum Pictures)If you were online in late 2014 or early 2015, when the science fiction series Humans was being promoted heavily, there’s a good chance you saw a lot of Gemma Chan’s face in that show’s advertising.&nbsp;Similar to&nbsp;Karen Gillan’s&nbsp;transition from Doctor Who to playing Marvel’s Nebula (and to a lesser degree, Pom Klementieff as Mantis), Chan has taken on a role in next year’s&nbsp;Captain Marvel,&nbsp;playing the Kree character Minn-Erva, a.k.a. Doctor Minerva in the comics, a “geneticist and spy” who has deep ties to how Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) becomes Captain Marvel. Marvel Studios has scheduled Captain Marvel for March 8, 2019, which is currently one week after How to Train Your Dragon 3&nbsp;and one week before Jordan Peele’s untitled next film. As for what we can expect from Captain Marvel, screenwriter Geneva Robertson-Dworet said this week that she will be “so sassy, she’s such a smartass, she won’t take sh– from anyone.”8. SILVER SURFER FINALLY GETS HIS SOLO MOVIE AS FOX DEVELOPS ITS POST-DISNEY SLATE(Photo by 20th Century Fox courtesy Everett Collection)20th Century Fox has been considering producing a Silver Surfer movie since the 1990s, including a&nbsp;period when the studio was inspired by this Silver Surfer&nbsp;short film, and the years leading up to 2007’s Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&nbsp;(Rotten at 37%). Although he did start in the comics as a Fantastic Four supporting character (along with his world-eating boss Galactus), Silver Surfer went on to&nbsp;lead a few different solo series (including a long one in the 1990s) as one of the biggest stars of Marvel’s cosmic universe. We don’t know for sure yet how the Disney/Fox merger will impact these plans, but Fox is developing new Marvel films, including a newly-announced Silver Surfer, and previously announced movies for Doctor Doom, Kitty Pryde, X-Force (filming in October), and Gambit. The Silver Surfer movie is now being adapted by LOST and Runaways writer Brian K. Vaughn. Fox is also going to be doing reshoots for next year’s The New Mutants (2/22/19, previously scheduled for this spring), including the addition of a new character (speculated by some to be the alien creature Warlock).ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1. FOX PLANNING TO REMAKE&nbsp;9 TO 5(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. courtesy Everett Collection)As demonstrated in this recent RT feature, there have been some really horrible movie remakes (and a lot of them are relatively recent, too). And yet, these things keep coming. The latest target is the 1980 feminist comedy 9 to 5 (originally starring Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton), which 20th Century Fox is now developing within a post-#MeToo mindset. With that in mind, 20th Century Fox has hired Parks and Recreation star Rashida Jones to star work on the project, “to find a handle that can make the concept relevant to a young comedy audience.” Presuming this would mean that Jones would be one of the three female office workers (maybe the Jane Fonda?), who would you cast alongside her?","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"TV, Amazon, Review","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/02161221/Brad-Pitt-Tarantino-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"brad-pitt-joins-quentin-tarantinos-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509185855835","title":"Disney Officially Acquires Fox Film and TV Properties, And More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Disney Officially Acquires Fox Film and TV Properties, And More Movie NewsThe annual Black List is released, a book sequel to Ready Player One is coming, and new projects for Jennifer Lawrence, Seth Rogen, Gal Gadot, Guillermo Del Toro, and more.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 15, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you eleven headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Fantastic Four and Venom, and new roles for Kevin Hart, Jennifer Lawrence, and Seth Rogen.This WEEK’S TOP STORYDISNEY OFFICIALLY ACQUIRES FOX FILM AND TV PROPERTIES(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)The Marvel Cinematic Universe as we now know it (The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc.) only dates back to the 2008 release of Iron Man, but long before that, Marvel fans had been frustrated by the separation of Marvel movies between studios. X-Men, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four were at Fox; Spider-Man and Ghost Rider were at Sony; The Punisher was at Lionsgate; and Hulk was at Universal. Over time, most of those came back to Marvel Studios, but the Fox films were still separate. The newsfeed-dominating impact of Disney’s acquisition of Fox film and TV properties this week has been the seemingly final step in allowing for a true representation of the “Marvel Universe” in the movies (and presumably TV too). (Though we should note the speculation that this is really all about Disney’s future streaming plans.)There had been speculation that the Fantastic Four rights might be held up by Constantin Film (the company behind Roger Corman’s original 1994 Fantastic Four), but Disney CEO Bob Iger has confirmed that the&nbsp;Fantastic Four&nbsp;indeed now belongs to Disney&nbsp;as well. Likewise, Iger has clarified that Deadpool can stay R-rated, even as a Disney property. And these points are just the tip of the iceberg about what this deal means for Marvel fans and movie fans in general&nbsp;(See below for even more).Fresh Developments1. JENNIFER LAWRENCE TO&nbsp;EXPERIENCE ICELANDIC BURIAL RITES(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)On this year’s Awards Leaderboard here at Rotten Tomatoes, the top five films are: Get Out, Lady Bird, The Florida Project, The Shape of Water, and at #5, Call Me By Your Name. That last film&nbsp;is the third of a thematic trilogy from Italian director Luca Guadagnino&nbsp;(following I Am Love and A Bigger Splash). This week, we learned what is likely to be Guadagnino’s next film,&nbsp;and some of the details are quite surprising. That new film, which will star Jennifer Lawrence, is&nbsp;Burial Rites, based on a 2013 novel&nbsp;by Hannah Kent, and it&nbsp;will tell the true story of Agnes Magnusdottir, the last woman to be publicly executed in Iceland, in 1830. If the film can be&nbsp;finished in time for a late 2018 release, the ingredients are certainly there for possibly one of next year’s big awards season contenders.2. THIS YEAR’S BLACK LIST INCLUDES NEW FILMS STARRING GAL GADOT, SANDRA BULLOCK, OTHER BIG NAMES(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Since 2005, a group of Hollywood development executives and producers have produced the results of a survey called&nbsp;The Black List&nbsp;(also subtitled “The Black List of Unproduced Screenplays”). The survey was voted upon by a select list of film projects that have not yet been produced (i.e., they’re still “in development”). Past winners have included such films as&nbsp;The Imitation Game,&nbsp;Recount,&nbsp;Draft Day, and&nbsp;The Beaver. The top of the list this year goes to the Nazi-hunting drama&nbsp;Ruin, in which Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman)&nbsp;is already attached to co-star. Sandra Bullock is attached to star in the #2 film,&nbsp;Let Her Speak, about Senator Wendy Davis’ filibuster to stop an abortion clinic bill. Other films to do well this year are&nbsp;Newsflash&nbsp;(see below), Kenneth Branagh’s&nbsp;Keeper of the Diary, and the biopic&nbsp;Hughes, about 1980s director John Hughes (The Breakfast Club,&nbsp;Ferris Bueller’s Day Off).3. SETH ROGEN TO SWITCH GEARS AS WALTER CRONKITE IN HISTORICAL DRAMA NEWSFLASH(Photo by Glen Wilson/Universal Pictures)One of the signature career turns for comedians-turned-actors is when they do a deep dive into a truly dramatic role. Bill Murray, Jim Carrey, Eddie Murphy, Kristen Wiig, Robin Williams, and Adam Sandler have all, at some point, made that turn.&nbsp;One of the biggest comedy stars to not yet fully star in a drama is Seth Rogen (not counting supporting roles in Steve Jobs and The Disaster Artist). Rogen’s first major dramatic starring role will be a huge one indeed, as he is now attached to play iconic CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite. The film, called Newsflash, will tell the true story of November 22, 1963, the day on which Cronkite broke the news to the world that President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas. Newsflash will be directed by David Gordon Green, whose filmography has included Stronger, All the Real Girls, and Seth Rogen’s Pineapple Express.4. READY PLAYER ONE AUTHOR NOW WORKING ON SEQUEL (READY PLAYER TWO, MAYBE?)(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)We are still over three months away from the 3/30/18 release of Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, based on the nostalgia-fest novel&nbsp;by Ernest Cline. However, this week Cline revealed that he is currently working on a sequel novel to Ready Player One, though he didn’t reveal any details about&nbsp;it. However, Cline did mention that he was inspired by Steven Spielberg directing the first movie, and that he was able to “bounce ideas” off Spielberg as he prepared to write the sequel. It’s not yet known if Spielberg might also direct a sequel movie. As for what those ideas could involve, obviously direct speculation would involve knowing how Ready Player One ends (which we won’t get into). However, one non-spoiler idea is that Ready Player Two (or whatever it’s called) could move on to&nbsp;the pop culture of the 1990s or 2000s, similar to the way&nbsp;Ready Player One is dominated by references to the 1980s.5. GUILLERMO DEL TORO TO REMAKE 1947’S NIGHTMARE ALLEY(Photo by Kerry Hayes/Universal Pictures)Director&nbsp;Guillermo Del Toro has had a series of projects slip away from him, including next spring’s sequel Pacific Rim: Uprising and the third Hellboy. This year, however, Del Toro not only actually got The Shape of Water made, but it’s currently #4 on Rotten Tomatoe’s Awards Leaderboard. This week, we learned that one of Del Toro’s possible future films&nbsp;is a remake of a 1947 film noir classic starring Tyrone Power. The original Nightmare Alley tells a twist-filled story of a carnival barker’s rise and fall in a tale that bears comparison to Tod Browning’s Freaks.6. WOODY HARRELSON TO REUNITE WITH ZOMBIELAND DIRECTOR IN MARVEL’S VENOM(Photo by Glen Wilson/Columbia Pictures)As we get more and more Marvel movies (and this isn’t going to slow down anytime soon), the list of actors who haven’t appeared in them is going to get really slim in years to come. This week, Zombieland and The Hunger Games star Woody Harrelson was the latest&nbsp;to join the club. The new trailer for next December’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse also debuted this week, teasing the idea of Sony’s Spider-Man spinoff movies perhaps being set in that “Spider-Verse” (separate from the MCU). We don’t know yet who Woody Harrelson will play in Venom (10/5/18), except that he will be a “henchman.” (It’s fun to imagine he could actually be playing Carnage.) Harrelson previously worked with director Ruben Fleischer on Zombieland, so that now makes Venom a reunion project for them. As for what Venom is actually about, we learned this week that it’s based on two comic book storylines: Lethal Protector and Planet of the Symbiotes (so, not only is Tom Hardy Venom, but many of the characters might be alien symbiotes?).7. KEVIN HART TO GO ON THE RUN(Photo by Warner Bros.)&nbsp;Actor-comedian&nbsp;Kevin Hart is in the midst of an impressive box office streak. Many of his biggest box office hits, however, were the results of team-ups, either with Ice Cube (Ride Along and its sequel) or Dwayne Johnson (Central Intelligence, and presumably, next week’s Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle). Next year, Hart will lead the ensemble comedy Night School (9/28/18), with a supporting cast including Tiffany Haddish (Girls Trip) and Keith David. Many of Hart’s films are with Universal Pictures, and that studio is also behind this latest project, in which Hart will be the solo headliner. In the film, Hart will star as a professional hitman whose latest job goes awry when he realizes his target is an unexpected choice. On the Run will be written by Ayesha Carr, who was a writer/producer on The Carmichael Show, starring comedian Jerrod Carmichael. We mention Jerrod Carmichael specifically because he is also now co-writing 48 Hrs., a remake of the 1982 Eddie Murphy/Nick Nolte buddy cop movie.8.&nbsp;GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY STAR DAVE BAUTISTA TO STAR IN UBER COMEDY STUBER(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Wrestler-turned-actor Dave Bautista has co-starred in a number of sci-fi or action films, including Spectre, Riddick, and Blade Runner 2049, but his arguably highest profile role has been as Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy and its sequel. Career-wise, Bautista appears to be just on the edge of ascending to a career as an action star, possibly in the vein of Jason Statham or just beneath his “Groot” costar, Vin Diesel. The film that just might carry him&nbsp;over to that next box office level was confirmed this week to be an action comedy called Stuber. The title refers to an “Uber” driver named Stu who finds himself commandeered by a detective to be played by Dave Bautista (who presumably will be funnier than Tom Cruise was in Collateral). What we don’t know yet is who will play the title character, but it’s likely to be someone more traditionally “comedic.”ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK?1. IS THE DISNEY/FOX DEAL ACTUALLY GREAT NEWS OVERALL?(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)If your perspective of the movie business is only as a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or maybe superhero movies in general, the Disney/Fox deal might seem as the best news since, maybe Disney acquiring Marvel Studios. The bigger picture, however, has&nbsp;larger implications&nbsp;for the movie business. The 2018-2020 slate for the new Disney/Fox is jam-packed, and their competitors may find it even harder to compete (which could mean even less of a focus on smaller movies). Economic issues also include the possible loss Hollywood jobs, which is bad for everyone. The&nbsp;deal could also be bad news for fans of Fox Animation. Even the&nbsp;Marvel&nbsp;angle has its downsides, as “smaller” properties&nbsp;like the proposed sequels to The New Mutants might be edged out as Disney/Marvel/Fox narrow their new Marvel mission. We’ll just have to wait and see how everything plays out.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Travel","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/15165042/Disney-Fox-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"disney-officially-acquires-fox-film-and-tv-properties-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509185861982","title":"Jude Law Joins Captain Marvel, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jude Law Joins Captain Marvel, and More Movie NewsTarantino reveals the premise of his next film, Kenneth Branagh expands his Hercule Poirot universe, and new roles for Mahershala Ali, Vilola Davis, Lizzy Caplan, and Alexandra Shipp.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 24, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Thanksgiving weekend Ketchup brings you seven headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Captain Marvel, Gambit, Shaft, and Quentin Tarantino’s #9.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJUDE LAW JOINS THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE AS THEIR FIRST CAPTAIN MARVEL(Photo by Columbia Pictures)The superhero name Captain Marvel has a long and tangled history. New Line Cinema is preparing to start filming DC Comics’ Shazam! (who was actually the first Captain Marvel), and Marvel Studios also has their own Captain Marvel movie scheduled for March 8, 2019. Even within Marvel, there have been multiple heroes called Captain Marvel, but the MCU Captain Marvel will be Carol Danvers (previously Ms. Marvel), to be played by Brie Larson. We’ve known for a while that Captain Marvel would be something of an MCU prequel, as it will be set in the 1990s, feature the alien race the Skrulls as villains, and also Samuel L. Jackson as a younger Nick Fury. As a just-before-Thanksgiving shocker, the news broke that Jude Law will be the male lead in Captain Marvel, and he’s playing “Dr. Walter Lawson.” That right there is sort of a big deal, because that’s the name that the Kree alien named “Mar-Vell” took when he arrived on Earth. And rather coincidentally, Mar-Vell was a Captain. Mar-Vell has been right up there with Adam Warlock (see also: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2) as one of the cosmic characters Marvel fans most want to see in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Fresh Developments1. QUENTIN TARANTINO REVEALS THE PREMISE OF HIS NINTH MOVIE(Photo by Francois Duhamel/Weinstein Company)We still don’t have a title for&nbsp;Quentin Tarantino‘s next project, but this week, we finally learned its premise (possibly&nbsp;to stop people from calling it his “Charles Manson movie“). We still don’t know who will play the two leads (though Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Tom Cruise are reportedly all possibilities), but we now know more about the characters. The film will revolve around an actor who’s had some success in television, and is hoping to expand into movies, and he’s accompanied by his stunt double (who’s looking for the same thing). It’s all set in Hollywood in 1969 as the Manson Family and the murder of Sharon Tate (likely to be played by Margot Robbie) take place concurrently. This week, we also learned some of the details about how exactly Sony Pictures landed the rights&nbsp;to the film after a competitive multi-studio bidding war.2. VIOLA DAVIS&nbsp;JOINS BOOK ADAPTATION&nbsp;I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT YOUTerry McMillan is best known for writing the two novels that inspired the Angela Bassett movies Waiting to Exhale and How Stella Got Her Groove Back. McMillan’s next novel to be developed as a movie will be last year’s I Almost Forgot About You, and&nbsp;another prominent actress will take the lead on it:&nbsp;Viola Davis (The Help, Fences) who is possibly best known for her more serious dramatic films&nbsp;and her work on Shonda Rhimes’&nbsp;How to Get Away with Murder. I Almost Forgot About You will be directed by Malcolm D. Lee, who is particularly “hot” coming off this summer’s Girls Trip. Screenwriter Ron Bass, who previously worked on the aforementioned Bassett/McMillan films, will also adapt I Almost Forgot About You.3.&nbsp;MOONLIGHT STAR MAHERSHALA ALI TO PRODUCE AND STAR&nbsp;IN&nbsp;BURN(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/Netflix)In the last few years, Mahershala Ali has co-starred in several noteworthy films (The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Hidden Figures) and Netflix series (Luke Cage, House of Cards), but it was last year’s Academy Awards Best Picture winner&nbsp;Moonlight&nbsp;that really catapulted him into the spotlight. Ali is now in a position to produce his own projects, and for his first, he’s chosen an upcoming novel by author A.J. Wolfe. In the adaptation of the novel Burn, Ali will play “a Northern California detective who destroyed a cartel while keeping his undercover life secret from his family.” Mahershala Ali will also play the lead in the third season of HBO’s True Detective, and will costar in Robert Rodriguez’s manga adaptation Battle Angel: Alita.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. KENNETH BRANAGH’S AGATHA CHRISTIE CINEMATIC UNIVERSE CONTINUES WITH DEATH ON THE NILE(Photo by Nicola Dove/20th Century Fox Film Corp.)As other attempts at “cinematic universes” flail and fail (Universal’s Dark Universe, and even possibly DC, post-Justice League), 20th Century Fox is moving forward with what could be the unlikeliest of such franchises. Although their recent remake of Murder on the Orient Express earned a borderline Rotten Tomatometer score of 59%, the film’s $156 million (and counting) global box office is apparently enough to warrant a sequel. Fox and director Kenneth Branagh are now developing a remake of 1978’s Death on the Nile (adapted from Christie’s 1937 novel), another ensemble mystery (the original included Bette Davis, David Niven, and Angela Lansbury). Kenneth Branagh will also reprise his role as detective Hercule Poirot, as he vacations in Egypt.2. LIZZY CAPLAN JOINS CHANNING TATUM’S MARVEL MOVIE GAMBIT(Photo by Showtime)The relatively disappointing box office of Justice League has some wondering about the future of Warner Bros’ DC Comics movies. The three studios that make Marvel adaptations, however, are proceeding briskly. Fox is committed, for example, to releasing three Marvel movies a year, starting with 2018 (The New Mutants, Deadpool 2, X-Men: Dark Phoenix). The first such film scheduled for 2019 is Gambit (2/14/19), starring Channing Tatum as the cajun mutant gambler superhero. After a few false starts, filming is scheduled to start soon, with Lizzy Caplan (Masters of Sex, Cloverfield) now in talks to play the film’s female lead. It’s not yet known if Caplan will be playing the same Belladonna Bourdreaux character that might have once been played by Lea Seydoux. This week’s Gambit news registers as a “Rotten Idea” not because of Lizzy Caplan, but because of director Gore Verbinski‘s recent streak of Rotten films (including&nbsp;The Lone Ranger and A Cure for Wellness).1. X-MEN: APOCALYPSE STAR ALEXANDRA SHIPP JOINS SHAFT REBOOT(Photo by Christos Kalohoridis /Lifetime/Lionsgate )Fox did a soft reboot of their X-Men franchise with X-Men: Days of Future Past. One of the characters reimagined in its sequel X-Men: Apocalypse was Storm, with Alexandra Shipp taking over the character originally played by Halle Berry. This week, Shipp joined another similar soft reboot, namely the new Shaft, which is also a direct sequel. Jessie T. Usher will play the son of the Shaft that Samuel L. Jackson played in the 2000 version, and Shipp will play his romantic interest. To really complete the generational theme, both Samuel L. Jackson and original Shaft star Richard Roundtree will reprise their roles as well. The new Shaft is being directed by Tim Story, who currently boasts a seven-movie Rotten streak (if you don’t count his Kevin Hart comedy concert movies).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Family, Lifetime, Vudu, spain","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14020300/Jude-Law-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"jude-law-joins-captain-marvel-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509185876324","title":"Warner Bros.

Announces Teen Titans Go! To The Movies for 2018, and More Movie NewsSausage Party director tackles The Addams Family, Gal Gadot joins a WWI thriller, Sly Stallone directs Creed 2, and Disney pulls Gigantic.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 13, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as The Addams Family, Creed 2, The New Mutants, and Teen Titans Go! to the Movies.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHE DC COMICS SURPRISE LESS THAN A YEAR AWAY: TEEN TITANS GO! TO THE MOVIES(Photo by Cartoon Network courtesy Everett Collection)In this era when release dates are announced years&nbsp;in advance (what movie are you&nbsp;most looking forward to&nbsp;in 2020?), it’s really quite refreshing when a studio announces a surprise release. Two recent examples from last year include&nbsp;10 Cloverfield Lane&nbsp;(Certified Fresh) and&nbsp;Blair Witch (not so Fresh). It’s&nbsp;rare for such a reveal to&nbsp;come from one of the two big comic book franchises, but that’s exactly what we have in the news that Warner Bros is theatrically releasing Teen Titans Go! to the Movies next summer on July 27, 2018. The animated film will be an extension of the popular Teen Titans Go!&nbsp;series on the Cartoon Network, which follows the adventures&nbsp;of Beast Boy, Cyborg, Raven, Robin, and Starfire, and will feature the TV voice cast, as well as Will Arnett and Kristen Bell. Although their voice roles haven’t been confirmed yet, Arnett does voice the LEGO Batman, so that’s one possibility. The other big movie currently scheduled for July 27, 2018 is Mission: Impossible 6.Fresh Developments1. SCARY THE NEW MUTANTS TRAILER DEBUTS; DIRECTOR TAKES ON STEPHEN KING’S THE TALISMAN(Photo by 20th Century Fox)When director Josh Boone had his breakthrough success with 2014’s teen drama The Fault in Our Stars, it may not have been immediately obvious that his career would turn to horror next. The spooky trailer reveal today (on Friday the 13th, no less) of his X-Men spinoff The New Mutants (4/13/18) indicates that’s exactly what’s happening. As evidenced by this animatic&nbsp;from last year, The New Mutants appears to be at least partly inspired by “The Demon Bear Saga”&nbsp;from 1984. In addition, Boone is also now working on writing (and possibly directing) an adaptation of the 1984 fantasy novel The Talisman, co-written by Stephen King and Peter Straub. Although King is seemingly “in” right now because of the success of IT, The Talisman actually has more in common with recent flop The Dark Tower.2. KOOKY, SPOOKY, AND ALTOGETHER OOKY: THEY’RE THE (ANIMATED) ADDAMS FAMILYAlthough animation director Conrad Vernon‘s most recent film was last year’s R-rated comedy Sausage Party (which he codirected), his previous movies are decidedly more “family friendly” (Shrek 2, Monsters vs Aliens, Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted). It sounds like Vernon will be returning to his roots, as he has signed with MGM to direct their animated adaptation of The Addams Family. The notion of a reboot of the characters created by Charles Addams has been kicking around for many years, including an Illumination Entertainment project announced in 2010 which would have been stop-motion and directed by Tim Burton. Previous adaptations of The Addams Family have included the 1960s live-action TV series, and three feature films in the 1990s.3.&nbsp;WONDER WOMAN STAR GAL GADOT LEADS NAZI-HUNTER THRILLER RUIN(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although she certainly hasn’t had&nbsp;any problems staying busy recently, Gal Gadot‘s star&nbsp; has only continued to rise since the success&nbsp;of Wonder Woman. Warner Bros is reportedly hoping to start filming Wonder Woman 2 in the summer of 2018, but Gadot is now in talks for something to film before then. That movie is called Ruin, and it’s described as a thriller in the vein&nbsp;of Inglourious Basterds, centering on “an ex-Nazi captain in post-World War II Germany [seeking] atonement for his crimes by tracking down the surviving members of his former SS Death Squad.” Ruin will be directed by Justin Kurzel, whose filmography had been quite Fresh before last year’s video game adaptation&nbsp;Assassin’s Creed.4. WILL SMITH AND TOM HOLLAND TO VOICE PIGEON&nbsp;SPIES IN DISGUISE(Photo by Barry Wetcher, Jonathan Prime/Warner Bros.)Like a lot of movie stars nowadays, both Will Smith (Deadshot in DC’s Suicide Squad) and Tom Holland (Marvel’s Spider-Man: Homecoming star) have starred in superhero movies, although for opposite sides of the “Big Two.” In 2019, however, Smith and Holland will be co-starring in a Fox Animation movie&nbsp;called Spies in Disguise (1/18/19), which will be an adaptation of the 2009 animated short film Pigeon: Impossible, which centered on a human spy who has a run-in with a pigeon. It’s unclear what species Smith’s and Holland’s characters will be.&nbsp;Spies in Disguise will be co-directed by Nick Bruno (Epic, The Peanuts Movie) and Troy Quane (Ice Age: Collision Course, Ferdinand). The other movie currently scheduled for January 18, 2019 is M. Night Shyamalan’s Glass, which is a sequel to both Unbreakable and this year’s horror hit Split.5. SYLVESTER STALLONE TO RESUME&nbsp;ROCKY&nbsp;FRANCHISE DIRECTING DUTIES FOR&nbsp;CREED 2(Photo by Warner Bros.)When the&nbsp;Rocky&nbsp;boxing franchise spinoff&nbsp;Creed&nbsp;was a critical&nbsp;and&nbsp;box office success, it was also hailed for being&nbsp;a crucial next step&nbsp;in Hollywood’s move towards more diversity and representation both behind and in front of the cameras. After&nbsp;Creed, director Ryan Coogler moved on to Marvel Studios’&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;(and he will presumably remain busy with the FX-heavy superhero movie well into early 2018). That might just be why we learned this week that the inevitable&nbsp;Creed&nbsp;sequel will not be directed by Coogler again, but&nbsp;by&nbsp;Sylvester Stallone instead. That makes&nbsp;Creed 2&nbsp;Stallone’s fifth film as director in the&nbsp;Rocky&nbsp;franchise, following&nbsp;Rocky II&nbsp;(73%),&nbsp;Rocky III&nbsp;(63%),&nbsp;Rocky IV&nbsp;(39%), and&nbsp;Rocky Balboa&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 76%). Michael B. Jordan will reprise his role as Adonis Creed in&nbsp;Creed 2,&nbsp;which&nbsp;will feature&nbsp;Ivan Drago&nbsp;(Dolph Lundgren), the Russian boxer responsible for (30 year old spoiler) the in-ring death of&nbsp;Adonis’ father Apollo in&nbsp;Rocky IV.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4. COMEDIAN TYLER PERRY WILL BE THE DICK CHENEY BIOPIC’S COLIN POWELL(Photo by K.C. Bailey/LionsGate)Tyler Perry is obviously best known for writing, directing, producing and starring in his series of Madea movies (including next week’s Tyler Perry’s Boo 2!: A Madea Halloween). Perry does, however, occasionally appear in other director’s more dramatic films, such as Alex Cross and Gone Girl. This week, he signed on for a film from a director who has also been more famous for his comedies in the past. Tyler Perry has agreed to co-star as Secretary of State Colin Powell in the director Adam McKay‘s Dick Cheney biopic, which&nbsp;doesn’t have an official title yet (though it might be Backseat). Perry joins a growing ensemble cast that includes Amy Adams (Lynne Cheney), Steve Carell (Donald Rumsfeld), Sam Rockwell (George W. Bush), Bill Pullman (Nelson Rockefeller), and its Dick Cheney, Christian Bale (who has been gaining weight for the role).3.&nbsp;HELEN MIRREN, LUKE EVANS, CILLIAN MURPHY JOIN&nbsp;VALERIAN DIRECTOR’S&nbsp;ANNA(Photo by Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros., Jasin Boland/Universal Pictures, Peter Mountain/Warner Bros.)There were a lot of box office disappointments this summer, so it’s understandably easy to forget some of them. One&nbsp;example — which arguably suffered from poor scheduling when it opened opposite Christopher Nolan’s&nbsp;Dunkirk&nbsp;— was&nbsp;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, from French action director Luc Besson (Lucy, The Fifth Element). The space opera starring Cara Delevigne and Dane DeHaan earned just $40 million domestically from a budget of $177 million. Besson’s EuropaCorp needs a cheaper hit next, so his next film, which will fall in the $25-$35 million range, will&nbsp;be&nbsp;Anna, featuring a British cast that includes Helen Mirren, Luke Evans, Cillian Murphy, and newcomer (and Russian model) Sasha Luss as the title character. That’s about all we can report right now, as the premise of Anna isn’t yet known, but it will have to be pretty awesome to turn around Besson’s Tomatometer.2. WALT DISNEY PULLS THE PLUG ON THEIR GIGANTIC JACK AND THE BEANSTALK MOVIE(Photo by Disney)Until this week, the next three new movies we knew about on Walt Disney Animation’s schedule were two sequels and one original film: Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2 (11/21/18), Frozen 2 (11/27/19), and Gigantic. That third movie was at one time scheduled for 2018, and then moved to November 25, 2020, but this week, Gigantic was revealed to have been completely shelved. Gigantic was to have been a romantic adaptation of the classic fairy tale&nbsp;“Jack and the Beanstalk,” with Jack being a human adventurer who falls in love with a girl giant. Walt Disney Animation Studios is now developing a different, mystery project for Thanksgiving 2020, but they haven’t announced any details about what&nbsp;it will be (one lingering possibility is a Zootopia sequel). We’re calling this one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because Gigantic had what seemed like a sweet, promising premise as a take on a beloved classic tale.1. DOZENS OF PLANNED MOVIES IMPACTED BY THE AFTERMATH OF THE HARVEY WEINSTEIN REVELATIONS(Photo by Jason Mendez/Everett Collection)If you follow movies or just news in general, you’ve no doubt heard something about (former) Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and the many allegations&nbsp;(still) being made about his behavior&nbsp;over&nbsp;the last 20+ years. To be clear, the real Rotten story here is Weinstein’s inexcusable and potentially criminal behavior, as well as the lasting effects of that behavior on his numerous victims, both personally and professionally. With that said — and not to downplay the real human cost of Weinstein’s transgressions — his departure from The Weinstein Company has also left a number of films (and the people involved) with uncertain futures. First of all, there are the films already produced by TWC, such as the&nbsp;historical biopic&nbsp;The Current War&nbsp;(11/24/17), the children’s&nbsp;film sequel Paddington 2 (1/12/18), The War with Grandpa, The Upside, and the Biblical epic Mary Magdalene.&nbsp;In addition, Lin-Manuel Miranda and his partners on the musical In the Heights now&nbsp;want to pull the film adaptation&nbsp;away from TWC, and Walt Disney Pictures has also removed Weinstein as a producer of their long-in-development children’s adventure Artemis Fowl. Other film development deals left floundering in Weinstein’s wake include Steven Spielberg’s Edgardo Mortara, the Richard Pryor biopic, and the TV series adaptations Knight Rider and The Six Billion Dollar Man.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"2018, police, Horror, show, show, spain, space, 4/20, Oscars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13124906/Teen-Titans-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"warner-bros-announces-teen-titans-go-to-the-movies-for-2018-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509187577197","title":"Disney to Part Ways with Netflix in 2018, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Disney to Part Ways with Netflix in 2018, and More Movie NewsAlfre Woodard joins The Lion King, Chris Pratt's Cowboy Ninja Viking is greenlit, Riz Ahmed joins Venom, and Jennifer Garner is the next \"female John Wick.\"by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 11, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, including stories about&nbsp;Creed 2, The Lion King, Venom, and the Hellboy reboot.This WEEK’S TOP STORYWALT DISNEY PICTURES PULLING OUT OF NETFLIX AFTER 2018(Photo by Ted Thai/Getty Images)In a big corporate shakeup, Walt Disney Pictures has announced that they are pulling out of their current streaming deal with Netflix after 2018.&nbsp; Instead, starting in 2019, Disney will have their own app which will start with ESPN, and then include their various Disney and Pixar movies. Netflix and Disney remain in negotiations about future Marvel and Star Wars movies, while&nbsp;Netflix’s Marvel shows (Daredevil, Luke Cage, etc.), which Netflix itself produces, are expected to remain. In possibly related news, Netflix has made its first acquisition ever, purchasing Millarworld, the comic book publisher run by Mark Millar, creator of Kick-Ass, Wanted, and Kingsman: The Secret Service.Fresh Developments1. ALFRE WOODARD TO VOICE THE LION KING‘S MOM SARABIWalt Disney Pictures showed again this week that they are masters of timing the weekly news cycle. Disney revealed last week that Chiwetel Ejiofor will be voicing the villain Scar in their remake of The Lion King (7/19/19). This week, director Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Jungle Book) cast another major character, as we now know that Alfre Woodard will voice Sarabi the lion, Mufasa’s wife and Simba’s mother. Disney also recently cast relative newcomer Marwan Kenzari as the villain Jafar in their live-action remake of Aladdin.2. DAVID HASSELHOFF HOPES GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY DIRECTOR WILL DRIVE KNIGHT RIDER(Photo by Universal TV courtesy Everett Collection)Most of the stories we include in the Weekly Ketchup are officially confirmed, but some&nbsp;are just too cool not to report on. Sort of buried in a piece on Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn, The Hollywood Reporter closed with a potentially huge reveal for a completely different would-be franchise.&nbsp; While filming his cameo in Vol. 2, David Hasselhoff now says that he made a pitch to James Gunn about him directing the big screen reboot of Hasselhoff’s TV series Knight Rider. Said Hasselhoff, “If it does go forward, I don’t want it to be spoofed like Baywatch or 21 Jump Street. Those films lose what it’s about, and you have to respect the fans.”3. AMAZON TO PRODUCE CATE BLANCHETT’S LUCILLE BALL BIOPIC LUCY AND DESI(Photo by Lisa Tomasetti/Sony Pictures )We&nbsp;first heard about the Lucille Ball biopic Lucy and Desi back in 2015, with Cate Blanchett attached to star. Further increasing their profile, Amazon Studios has picked up the rights to Lucy and Desi in what looks like a future bid at further Academy Awards glory (following the success of Manchester by the Sea). Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network, TV’s The West Wing) is in talks to adapt the story of Ball’s 20 year marriage to bandleader and TV costar Desi Arnaz (who is yet to be cast).4. CHRIS PRATT’S COWBOY NINJA VIKING GREENLIT FOR THE SUMMER OF 2019(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)This week started with sad news about Chris Pratt and Anna Faris, but it wasn’t the only story involving the Guardians of the Galaxy star. One of the first new deals Pratt made in 2014 following the success of GotG was a graphic novel adaptation called Cowboy Ninja Viking, but we haven’t heard much about it since. Universal Pictures has now announced that Cowboy Ninja Viking is scheduled for June 28, 2019 (the same date as&nbsp;Transformers 6). Pratt will play an assassin with multiple personality disorder who flips between being, you guessed it, a cowboy, a ninja, and a viking.5.&nbsp;ROCKY IV VILLAIN IVAN DRAGO MIGHT RETURN IN CREED 2(Photo by MGM courtesy Everett Collection)Former Rocky star Sylvester Stallone took to both Twitter and TMZ this week to discuss the sequel to the 2015 spinoff Creed. Stallone’s repeated hints were almost entirely about the Russian boxer Ivan Drago, played by Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV, starting with, “You know I gotta hit Drago once.” Since Michael B. Jordan plays the son of Carl Weathers’ Apollo Creed, it’s possible that the pretense of Ivan Drago’s return is as the father of a new Russian boxer. There is no release date for Creed 2 (it might be in late 2018).6.&nbsp;ROGUE ONE CO-STAR RIZ AHMED JOINS TOM HARDY IN VENOM(Photo by Jay Maidment/Focus Features)As superhero movies continue to dominate both box office figures and development plans, these movies are really under a microscope.&nbsp; And sometimes, plans also change, so what we hear now might be different in the final film.&nbsp; For their Venom movie, Sony has reportedly been considering the red-goo-monster Carnage as the film’s villain.&nbsp;Rogue One co-star Riz Ahmed is in talks to be the second announced cast member of Venom (after Tom Hardy). Although he reportedly read for the role of Carnage, Sony is now saying that he will play another “popular” Marvel character. Venom will ooze into theaters October 5, 2018.7. MELISSA MCCARTHY ENLISTS FOR 1970S COP DRAMA(Photo by Hopper Stone /Columbia Pictures)Although Melissa McCarthy did co-star in several dramas early in her career, since Bridesmaids, she’s&nbsp;mostly appeared in comedies. McCarthy’s future plans indicate she’ll continue that trend&nbsp;(like 2018’s Life of the Party and Margie Claus), but she also has dramas planned. This week, New Line Cinema won the film rights to a planned book, and McCarthy will both star in the adaptation&nbsp;and produce along with her husband and frequent director Ben Falcone. The untitled book tells the true story of the first female police officers in the Boston Police Department, described as an “old boys club.”ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. MILLA JOVOVICH TO REIGN AS BLOOD QUEEN IN THE HELLBOY REBOOT(Photo by Ilze Kitshoff/Screen Gems)We still have over two months until Stranger Things returns on October 27th, but one of the show’s stars, David Harbour, will soon start filming his next major role, in the R-rated Hellboy reboot, and this week, we learned who will be the film’s antagonist. Milla Jovovich, recently coming off her sixth&nbsp;Resident Evil film, has been cast as the Blood Queen (speculated to be the comic book character Nimue). Previously called Hellboy: Rise of the Blood Queen, the R-rated reboot will be directed by Neil Marshall (The Descent, Doomsday), taking over from Guillermo Del Toro. Jovovich’s 20+ Rotten Tomatometer scores is why this story is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.1.&nbsp;JENNIFER GARNER TO STAR IN “FEMALE JOHN WICK” PEPPERMINT(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)We heard just two weeks ago that Lionsgate had plans for a female John Wick spinoff called The Ballerina. Unsurprisingly, some of their competitors also have their sights on action movies that could be perceived in a similar vein.&nbsp;(Not that this is an entirely original conceit.) For example, Jennifer Garner (2005’s Elektra) is now in talks with STXFilms to star in their action movie Peppermint, which is indeed described as a “female John Wick.” Peppermint will be directed by Pierre Morel (Taken, The Gunman).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"History, disaster, Horse, Diego, Pixar, discovery, sitcom, Kids, jones","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/11161821/Disney-TV-Netflix-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"disney-to-part-ways-with-netflix-in-2018-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509185874275","title":"Thor: Ragnarok Star Tessa Thompson Wants To Do a Lady Liberators Movie, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Thor: Ragnarok Star Tessa Thompson Wants To Do a Lady Liberators Movie, and More NewsThe New Mutants will be a trilogy, Daisy Ridley and Josh Gad join a superhero comedy, and Morgan Freeman will play Colin Powell.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 20, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as The New Mutants, Solo: A Star Wars Story, and new roles for Dave Bautista and Daisy Ridley.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHOR: RAGNAROK STAR TESSA THOMPSON WANTS MARVEL TO DO A&nbsp;LADY LIBERATORS MOVIE(Photo by Marvel Studios)We may or may not ever get a Black Widow solo movie, but Marvel Studios is slowly adding more female superhero leads. Evangeline Lilly will be the first next year&nbsp;in Ant-Man and the Wasp (7/6/18), followed in 2019 by Brie Larson as Captain Marvel (3/8/19). Tessa Thompson is joining the MCU in a few weeks as Valkyrie in Thor: Ragnarok, and during filming, she pitched Marvel head Kevin Feige on another female-led project, Lady Liberators. As Feige replied, Lady Liberators is indeed a “deep cut,” but so was Guardians of the Galaxy. The all-female Lady Liberators super team has never had its own comic series, but it dates back to the 1970s, and Thompson’s Valkyrie (or someone pretending to be her) is frequently a member. Marvel doesn’t have the movie rights to a few of the&nbsp;Liberators, like Invisible Woman, Medusa, and Storm, but they could certainly make a movie around such existing MCU characters as Black Widow, Patsy Walker, Scarlet Witch, Valkyrie, and Wasp, plus new characters they&nbsp;could introduce, like She-Hulk, Spider-Woman, and Tigra. Of course, Marvel hasn’t made any official announcements about a Lady Liberators movie. Yet.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;X-MEN SPINOFF THE NEW MUTANTS TO BE THE FIRST OF A HORROR TRILOGY(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Especially for people unfamiliar with the original comics, the focus on horror in the trailer for the X-Men spinoff The New Mutants may have been confusing. Although&nbsp;they are “superheroes” in a traditional sense, many of the members lend themselves to the horror genre. Wolfsbane (Maisie Williams from Game of Thrones) is a werewolf, Magik (Anya Taylor-Joy) can teleport to demonic dimensions, and Dani Moonstar (newcomer Blu Hunt) can make people hallucinate their worst fears. Director Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars) revealed this week&nbsp;that The New Mutants is actually planned as a horror trilogy, with each film representing a different type of scary movie. Next year’s&nbsp;first installment&nbsp;(4/13/18) will represent “rubber reality,” and then, as Boone puts it, “our take was just go examine the horror genre through comic book movies and make each one its own distinct sort of horror film.”2. DAISY RIDLEY AND JOSH GAD JOIN MYSTERY SUPERHERO COMEDY(Photo by Nicola Dove/20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Matt Kennedy/Sony Pictures Releasing)So many movies these days are adaptations, remakes, or sequels that when a new project shows up that’s none of the above, it can be a bit surprising. This week’s example is an untitled comedy from the screenwriting twin brother team of Aaron and Jordan Kandell, who have previously been credited on Disney’s Moana (they also wrote&nbsp;Shailene Woodley’s upcoming hurricane survival drama Adrift). The Kandells are now working on a “superhero comedy,” which started as a story idea from Josh Gad (Frozen), who is also producing. In addition to Gad, the untitled&nbsp;film also has Daisy Ridley (Star Wars: The Last Jedi) and Luke Evans (Beauty and the Beast) attached to costar. What we don’t know, however, is pretty much everything else, including what Josh Gad’s comedy concept even is.3. DAVE BAUTISTA AND JAMIE FOXX TO WAG THEIR ANIMATED GROOVE TAILS(Photo by Dee Cercone, Adam Orchon/Everett Collection)Six-time WWE champion Dave Bautista obviously lads a lot of roles (Spectre, Blade Runner 2049, and Marvel’s Drax) because of his intimidating physical presence. His latest role, however,&nbsp;would ostensibly allow him to sit in a recording booth and eat carby snacks, because although it’s an “action comedy,” it’s also animated. Dave Bautista will voice “multiple roles” in Groove Tails, about a group of mice who “engage in a competitive street dance competition.” Jamie Foxx is producing Groove Tails&nbsp;and will also voice the lead character. Animator Cameron Hood, who has worked on several DreamWorks films like The Prince of Egypt, How to Train Your Dragon, and Kung Fu Panda 2, will make his directorial debut with Groove Tails.4. CHRISTIAN BALE AND AMY ADAMS ARE UNRECOGNIZABLE IN THE DICK CHENEY BIOPIC(Photo by Francois Duhamel/Columbia Pictures)Ever since we first learned that Christian Bale was going to star in the Dick Cheney biopic, it seemed likely that the British actor&nbsp;would&nbsp;pile on the pounds for the role. Bale has previously gained weight for American Hustle, and conversely, he went near-skeletal for 2004’s The Machinist. Last month&nbsp;brought confirmation that Bale was indeed going that route to play the former Vice President, as this video demonstrates. It wasn’t until this week, however, that we finally saw Christian Bale in character as Dick Cheney, and the resemblance is remarkable. You can also see Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney, and she’s equally as unrecognizable. There’s no release date for director Adam McKay‘s&nbsp;untitled Dick Cheney biopic yet, but an “awards season” release in late 2018 seems likely/possible.5. THE BUSH ERA BIOPICS CONTINUE WITH MORGAN FREEMAN AS COLIN POWELL(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)It was just last week that we reported that Tyler Perry will be co-starring in the Dick Cheney biopic as Secretary of State Colin Powell. Perhaps coincidentally (or not?), Morgan Freeman has also signed to star as Colin Powell in a&nbsp;separate independent biopic to be directed by Reginald Hudlin, who is coming right off last week’s Marshall, about the young Thurgood Marshall. Powell will be mostly set during the run up to the Iraq War, and Powell’s “now-infamous case for war to the United Nations Security Council. The evidence he presented was later discredited, and Powell has described the event as a low point in his career.”6.&nbsp;SEVEN SCREENWRITER ADAPTING MANGA AND SAMURAI CLASSIC LONE WOLF AND CUB(Photo by Toho Company courtesy Everett Collection)Lone Wolf and Cub is the English-language title of an acclaimed manga (Japanese comic) series, published from 1970 to 1976 in 28 volumes,&nbsp;about a swordsmanship master who is forced to journey with his infant son in tow. Lone Wolf and Cub was adapted as a series of six Japanese films (the first two of which were cut into a film called&nbsp;Shogun Assassin for US release) and two different TV series, but to date, nothing&nbsp;native to the United States. Back in the early 2000s, Darren Aronofsky attempted to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;Lone Wolf and Cub&nbsp;movie adaptation, and Justin Lin,&nbsp;director of&nbsp;Star Trek Beyond and four Fast and the Furious films, has been trying to get&nbsp;it made as a Hollywood film since 2012. This week, the project took an important step, as&nbsp;Lone Wolf and Cub is now in development at Paramount Pictures, and the studio has hired screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker&nbsp;to adapt&nbsp;the series&nbsp;as a single movie (to begin with). Walker’s previous film credits have included Se7en, Sleepy Hollow, and 2010’s The Wolfman.7. CHANNING TATUM PULLS HIS SEXUAL ABUSE MOVIE FROM THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY(Photo by Claudette Barius/Warner Bros.)Although Harvey Weinstein is now fully separated from The Weinstein Company, the studio is still feeling the impact of the dozens of allegations against Weinstein. We reported on several projects that were affected last week, but another big one emerged this week. Channing Tatum, the star of 21 Jump Street and Kingsman: The Golden Circle, has pulled his adaptation of the Matthew Quick YA novel Forgive Me, Leonard Peacock&nbsp;out of a previous deal with The Weinstein Company. Tatum described the novel as “a story about a boy whose life was torn asunder by sexual abuse. While we will no longer develop it or anything else that is property of TWC, we are reminded of its powerful message of healing in the wake of tragedy.” Good for Channing. On the other hand, the Weinstein Company itself&nbsp;has pulled their Thomas Edison film The Current War out of this year’s awards season, delaying the Benedict Cumberbatch vehicle until sometime in 2018.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. CHER JOINS MAMMA MIA: HERE WE GO AGAIN!(Photo by Stephen Vaughan/Screen Gems)Although there were over 20 Abba songs in the 2008 musical Mamma Mia!, there were a few Abba hits that didn’t make the cut, like “Knowing Me, Knowing You,” “One of Us,” “Summer Night City,” and “Fernando.” When the sequel Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again! was announced for a tenth anniversary release next year on July 20, 2018, it seemed likely that some of those songs would make the cut, and it looks like that’s the case. In a series of tweets, singer-turned-Academy-Award-winner Cher&nbsp;announced her casting in the film and included lyrics from “Fernando,” posting, “Just went through two dance numbers, Everyone’s Great.” In addition to the various returning cast members (Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, others), other new stars&nbsp;include&nbsp;Lily James (Baby Driver), Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), and Andy Garcia. The original Mamma Mia! earned a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 54%.1. DISNEY DROPS THE HAN FOR SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY(Photo by Ron Howard)Following the model of&nbsp;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, sources have long refered to the upcoming second anthology film as Han Solo: A Star Wars Story, which, it turns out, is close but incorrect. Director Ron Howard (Apollo 13, The Da Vinci Code) took to Twitter this week&nbsp;to announce that filming had wrapped, and also that the official title will be Solo: A Star Wars Story. The online reactions have varied widely, from positive to mocking/joking, as many people are pointing out that Solo sounds like a movie about those trademark red plastic cups. Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo), Donald Glover (Lando Calrissian), Emilia Clarke, and Woody Harrelson will be starring in Solo: A Star Wars Story when it’s released next summer on May 25, 2018.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Vudu, on, nightmare, leads, dark, vampires, game, marvel, Festival, Television","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/20173415/Tessa-Thompson-Thor-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"thor-ragnarok-star-tessa-thompson-wants-to-do-a-lady-liberators-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509187583342","title":"Chiwetel Ejiofor Will Voice Scar in Live-Action Lion King, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Chiwetel Ejiofor Will Voice Scar in Live-Action Lion King, and More Movie NewsAnother LEGO movie is in the works, Clint Howard joins Han Solo, classic Karate Kid gets a spinoff series, and Space Jam 2 waits for Lebron James' retirement.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 4, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development, including news about such titles as Bumblebee, Deadpool 2, the Han Solo prequel, and the Hellboy reboot.This WEEK’S TOP STORYCHIWETEL EJIOFOR TO VOICE SCAR IN LIVE-ACTION THE LION KING(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Fox Searchlight Pictures)Soon after Walt Disney Pictures announced their live-action remake of The Lion King (7/19/19), the studio also revealed that the title characters Simba and Mufasa would be voiced by Donald Glover (the new Lando Calrissian) and James Earl Jones (reprising the role). Since then, we’ve also learned that Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen are voicing Timon and Pumbaa, and John Oliver is voicing Zazu the bird, but the villain Scar remained a mystery. We can now report that Chiwetel Ejiofor is in talks with Disney to voice Scar (originally voiced by Jeremy Irons). With that said, we’re still missing a few major characters yet to be cast, like Nala, Rafiki, and the three hyenas.Fresh Developments1. FIRST IMAGES OF ZAZIE BEETZ AS DOMINO IN DEADPOOL 2&nbsp;RELEASED(Photo by 20th Century Fox)For superhero movies, what the characters look like is almost as important as who will star in them. This was true, for example, when Zazie Beetz (TV’s Atlanta) was cast as fan favorite&nbsp;Domino, one of Deadpool‘s X-Force teammates. With filming of Deadpool 2 (6/1/18) now underway in Vancouver, Ryan Reynolds teased our first look at Beetz in character, using Deadpool’s costume as a “red carpet” in an homage to this early promo image&nbsp;for the first Deadpool film. That was followed by this closeup that better shows off Domino’s trademark eye effects. We should get our first glimpse of Josh Brolin as time traveler Cable soon.2. GET READY, GET SET, LEGO WITH THE FIFTH&nbsp;MOVIE, THE BILLION BRICK RACE(Photo by Warner Bros.)After the surprise box office success of 2014’s The LEGO Movie, Warner Animation Group has been busy getting as many LEGO movies made&nbsp;as possible, and as quickly as possible. This year alone, Warner Bros. released The LEGO Batman Movie&nbsp;and will release The LEGO Ninjago Movie&nbsp;on September 22, 2017. Jorge Gutierrez (The Book of Life) is now taking over development of the LEGO racing movie called The Billion Brick Race, which was first announced back in 2015&nbsp;with different writers and producers.&nbsp;The Billion Brick Race will be the fifth LEGO movie after The LEGO Movie 2 (2/8/19).3. RON HOWARD CASTS HIS BROTHER CLINT IN THE HAN SOLO PREQUEL(Photo by Patti Perret/Faulkner-McLean Entertainment courtesy Everett Collection)Just one week ago, director Ron Howard cast Warwick Davis, who played Wicket in&nbsp;Return of the Jedi&nbsp;and had supporting roles in a few other&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;films, in next year’s Han Solo prequel (5/25/18).&nbsp;This week, Howard teased that he has also cast his brother Clint Howard in the prequel, saying, “You won’t be disappointed.”&nbsp;Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow also hired screenwriter Jack Thorne (Wonder) to work on Star Wars Episode IX this week. And, looping back to Ron Howard again, his daughter Bryce Dallas Howard is also now working on her own feature film directorial debut.4. THE KARATE KID TO CONTINUE AS YOUTUBE RED SERIES COBRA KAI(Photo by Columbia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Online streaming is increasingly becoming an avenue for projects that may have previously been theatrical. (See the Dark Tower news down below for another example ( TODAY’S WEEKLY KETCHUP URL / #R1 ). ) One recent example&nbsp;is The Karate Kid&nbsp;franchise, which started with a 1984 film starring Ralph Macchio, and was essentially&nbsp;rebooted in 2010 (though it was more like The Kung Fu Kid).&nbsp;Talk of a Jaden Smith/Jackie Chan sequel never really went anywhere, and now the series is going back to its roots. YouTube Red has won the rights to a 10-episode sequel series called Cobra Kai, which in 2018 will follow the further adventures of Ralph Macchio and his former nemesis played by William Zabka.5.&nbsp;DEADWOOD STAR IAN MCSHANE JOINS&nbsp;HELLBOY: THE RISE OF THE BLOOD QUEEN(Photo by David Lee/Summit Entertainment)While the world still awaits HBO’s Deadwood movie, Ian McShane has been keeping busy with roles&nbsp;in such genre favorites as Game of Thrones, American Gods, John Wick, and John Wick: Chapter Two. And movies don’t get much more “genre favorite” than those adapted from Mike Mignola’s Dark Horse series Hellboy. Following Guillermo Del Toro and Ron Perlman’s departures, the franchise is now being rebooted as Hellboy: The Rise of the Blood Queen, with David Harbour (Stranger Things) now starring. Ian McShane has signed on to co-star as Professor Bruttenholm (Hellboy’s adopted father), taking over for the late John Hurt.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4. THE DEATH WISH REBOOT TRAILER REVEALS A MOVIE CUSTOM MADE FOR 2017 AMERICA(Photo by MGM)Although they’re not always successful, every once in a while, the world gets the politically-tinged action movie it deserves or wants (like V for Vendetta&nbsp;or&nbsp;The Purge: Election Year). Although pundits probably should’ve been able to predict it, the new trailer for the Death Wish remake starring Bruce Willis seems like it’s attempting to tap into the zeitgeist in a similar way. The new Death Wish was directed by Eli Roth (Hostel, Cabin Fever), who needs a critical hit after a series of Rotten Tomatometer&nbsp;scores.3. WWE STAR JOHN CENA JOINS TRANSFORMERS PREQUEL BUMBLEBEE(Photo by Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures)We’ve known for about two months now that Hailee Steinfeld (True Grit, The Edge of Seventeen) was going to be the lead in the 1980s-set Transformers prequel Bumblebee. Of course, the Transformers movies always seem to want some level of “beefcake”, whether it be in the form of Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, or lately, Mark Wahlberg. Enter: WWE wrestler-turned-actor John Cena&nbsp;(Trainwreck) who will co-star in Bumblebee in an unknown role. Can Bumblebee break the Transformers franchise’s Rotten record&nbsp;when it opens against Aquaman on December 21, 2018?2.&nbsp;SPACE JAM (AND LEBRON JAMES) FANS WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO WAIT A FEW YEARS(Photo by Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures)Because Michael Jordan eventually returned to basketball (twice!), it might be easy to forget that he was actually retired when he filmed&nbsp;1996’s Space Jam. In doing so, he&nbsp;may have set a precedent for current NBA superstar&nbsp;Lebron James, who is set to star in the eventual Space Jam 2. Talking about the sequel this week, producer Justin Lin seemed to suggest that Space Jam 2 might just have to wait for James to retire, too, saying, “When the first one happened, it was during a strike and Michael Jordan was retired. From what I’ve learned in film, you have to be passionate and when you’re ready, you’ll make it happen.”1. THE DARK TOWER CASTS LONG SHADOW OVER ITS SPINOFF TV SERIES(Photo by Ilze Kitshoff/Columbia Pictures)We have yet to see&nbsp;what the final box office receipts will be like this weekend, but on the Tomatometer, The Dark Tower is a certified stinker, with a Rotten score of just 17%. Even so, the long-in-development plans for a Dark Tower TV series to be spun off of film are continuing. The news broke the day before the movie’s release that Glen Mazzara (showrunner of TV’s The Walking Dead) is now developing The Dark Tower as a series for Sony Pictures Television. Idris Elba, Dennis Haysbert, and Tom Taylor are all expected to reprise their roles on the 10-episode series, which is expected to debut on either cable or a streaming outlet.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"video, Sematary, Spectrum, review, Cosplay, GoT, Photos, dceu, Ovation, service","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/04164443/Chiwetel-Ejiofor-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"chiwetel-ejiofor-will-voice-scar-in-live-action-lion-king-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509187564906","title":"Warner Bros.

Wants Leonardo DiCaprio For Their Joker Origin Movie, and More NewsEd Srkein ditches Hellboy for noble reasons, Sam Rockwell will play Dubya, Ben and Casey Affleck bro down, and Lord of the Flies gets an all-female reboot.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 1, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, including stories about&nbsp;Ant-Man and the Wasp, Bumblebee, Cheney, Fantastic Voyage, Hellboy, and The Joker.This WEEK’S TOP STORYLEONARDO DICAPRIO WANTED FOR THE JOKER ORIGIN MOVIE(Photo by Mary Cybulski/Paramount Pictures)During the promotional tour for 2012’s&nbsp;The Dark Knight Rises, one of the most fascinating reveals was that, before they went with Bane as the villain, Warner Bros. had hoped to cast Leonardo DiCaprio as the Riddler. Nearly ten years later, DiCaprio is still on the studio’s wishlist, but this time the studio wants him to play&nbsp;The Joker. This reveal ties in with the biggest surprise of last week’s news, which was the involvement of frequent DiCaprio collaborator Martin Scorsese as one of the origin film’s producers. Of course, this doesn’t mean DiCaprio is a lock&nbsp;(as some are already speculating), but the concept is certainly fascinating, as he (along with Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise) remains one of the biggest stars who hasn’t yet jumped on the superhero bandwagon. All that said, Jared Leto remains attached to the&nbsp;Suicide Squad spinoff.Fresh Developments1. DEADPOOL CO-STAR DROPS OUT OF HELLBOY REBOOT TO AVOID WHITEWASHING &amp; ASIAN ERASURE(Photo by Bruno Calvo/EuropaCorp USA)Just five months ago, the live action Ghost in the Shell attracted controversy over the decision to cast Scarlett Johansson as a cyborg of Japanese origin, proving&nbsp;that “whitewashing” and Asian erasure is still a thing, as John Oliver addressed last year (as did&nbsp;this listicle, and this one). Ed Skrein, who played the villain in Deadpool, took a stance this week on the issue, dropping out of the Hellboy reboot after discovering that his character, Major Ben Daimio, is a Japanese-American in the comics. Skrein quickly earned praise and respect from figures like Ava DuVernay, John Cho, Riz Ahmed, and David Harbour (Stranger Things), AKA the star of the Hellboy reboot.2. SAM ROCKWELL JOINS DICK CHENEY BIOPIC AS PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH(Photo by Fox Searchlight)Oliver Stone’s 2008 George W. Bush biopic W. was perceived as one of the year’s box office flops. Richard Dreyfuss played Vice President Dick Cheney in that film, and soon, Christian Bale will do the same&nbsp;in Cheney (formerly titled Backseat), a biopic from director Adam McKay (The Big Short, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy). Other Cheney cast members will include Amy Adams (Lynne Cheney), Steve Carell (Donald Rumsfeld), and Bill Pullman (Nelson Rockefeller). The biggest political figure who remained uncast until this week was President George W. Bush himself, but we now know that the role is going to Sam Rockwell. This is the second politically charged new role for Sam Rockwell this year, as he is also co-starring as a KKK leader opposite Taraji P. Henson in a civil rights drama called The Best of Enemies.3. MARVEL DEBUTS OUR FIRST LOOK AT THE WASP (AND MISTY KNIGHT’S CYBORG ARM)(Photo by Evangeline Lilly)Last week was a big one for DC Comics, with two separate&nbsp;announcements about movies centered on&nbsp;the Joker. This week, however, thee advantage goes to Marvel Studios, who&nbsp;unveiled long-awaited first glimpses of&nbsp;two female characters — one from a movie and one from Netflix. First, we did technically see a Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but thanks to a tweet from Evangeline Lilly, we now know what she actually will look like&nbsp;in it when she appears&nbsp;in Ant-Man and the Wasp (7/6/18). Next, while the comics version of Misty Knight is best known for her awesome cyborg arm, the version Simone Missick portrays in Netflix’s Marvel series has never had one… until now, anyway. Marvel has revealed what Misty’s arm will look like in 2018’s Luke Cage Season 2.4. BEN AFFLECK TO DIRECT BROTHER CASEY IN WAR MOVIE RED PLATOON(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Ben Affleck has mostly worked with Warner Bros since his 2007 directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone,&nbsp;both as a director (The Town, Argo, Live by Night) and, obviously, as their current Batman. A look at Affleck’s Tomatometer as of late&nbsp;reveals he&nbsp;should maybe consider a change, so this week, he&nbsp;started talking to Sony. Specifically, Affleck is in early talks to direct Red Platoon, based on a memoir by Clinton Romesha, about the Battle of Kamdesh in Afghanistan in 2009. Sony is hoping that Ben’s brother and Gone Baby Gone star Casey Affleck will sign on to star in Red Platoon.5. GUILLERMO DEL TORO DELAYS FANTASTIC VOYAGE REMAKE(Photo by Kerry Hayes/Universal Pictures)&nbsp;This week, director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pacific Rim) announced that he is delaying filming his next movie, a remake of the 1966 science fiction classic Fantastic Voyage, about a team of scientists and physicians who are shrunk so that they can travel through a patient’s body. Instead, del Toro is going to take the extra time to focus on promoting this fall’s The Shape of Water, which just premiered at the Venice Film Festival and is already drawing rave reviews. 20th Century Fox was hoping to release Fantastic Voyage in late 2019, but now it might be 2020 or 2021.6.&nbsp;GAME OF THRONES’&nbsp;“LITTLEFINGER” JOINS JAMES JOYCE BIOPIC(Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)HBO’s global hit series&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;just aired its season 7 finale, which leaves&nbsp;just one more season before it all comes to an end. Aiden Gillen,&nbsp;a.k.a. Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish, is accordingly already planning his post-GoT schedule, signing on to star in the biopic James and Lucia. Gillen, who as Littlefinger was a master of acidic retorts (and very “mature” material), will get to do more of the same as controversial Irish writer James Joyce, the author of Ulysses.&nbsp;That novel became a key factor in how the United States handles censorship.7. KEANU REEVES AND WINONA RYDER TO REUNITE FOR A DESTINATION WEDDING(Photo by Warner Independent)Hollywood isn’t as interested in making romantic comedies as it once was, and&nbsp;fans of the genre have had to revisit the golden era of the modern rom-com, arguably the 1980s and 1990s, for a fix. Two major figures from that era are Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, who co-starred together in Bram Stoker’s Dracula and A Scanner Darkly. Though they&nbsp;never did a romantic comedy together, that’s set&nbsp;to change soon, as they recently wrapped filming of Destination Wedding, about two miserable wedding guests who fall in love over the course of a weekend together.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. HASBRO IS SUING DC COMICS OVER THE NAME OF THEIR TRANSFORMER BUMBLEBEE(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)The funny thing about copyrights and trademarks is how long companies will sometimes let them slide. For example, DC Comics introduced the Teen Titans character “Bumblebee” in 1976 (six years before the first Transformers toys came out), and that character peacefully coexisted with the popular yellow Transformers character of the same name (who’s getting a spinoff movie on 12/21/18) for over thirty years. Then, in 2015, DC Comics announced a new DC Super Hero Girls comics and toy franchise, and that’s when things started to heat up. This week, Hasbro filed paperwork against Warner Bros and DC Comics over the name “Bumblebee,” mostly over toy rights, which is obviously a big deal for Hasbro. We’re calling this a Rotten Idea because it’s sort of silly to think people will confuse this toy with this toy.1.&nbsp;WONDER WOMAN HAD AN AMAZON ISLAND, SO… WE GET A FEMALE REBOOT OF LORD OF THE FLIES?Hollywood really does think along pretty simplistic lines, it seems. Earlier this year, Warner Bros had a huge $800 million success with Wonder Woman, which was about 1/3 set on Themyscira, the fictional island home of the Amazons. Their takeaway from that was apparently “People love movies about girls on islands!” To that end, Warner Bros is completely changing a celebrated YA classic, inking a deal with the male screenwriters of 2005’s The Bee Season (43 percent on the Tomatometer) to write an alternate adaptation of William Golding’s novel Lord of the Flies as a movie about a group of stranded girls instead of boys. The online backlash to this news has been strong (and sometimes quite NSFW).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"your, chucky, Adult, streaming, Ice, Schedule, YA, criterion, Critics, A24, latino","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/01155001/Leonardo-DiCaprio-Joker-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"warner-bros-wants-leonardo-dicaprio-for-their-joker-origin-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509187600755","title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming Sequel Will Kick Off Next Marvel Story Arc, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Spider-Man: Homecoming Sequel Will Kick Off Next Marvel Story Arc, and More Movie NewsSony wants a Baby Driver sequel, Will Smith teams up with Ang Lee, Felicity Jones does Swan Lake, and The Grudge gets a reboot.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 7, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Baby Driver 2, Captain Marvel, Gemini Man, Swan Lake, and the reboot of The Grudge.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHE NEXT SPIDER-MAN WILL START NEW MARVEL ERA(Photo by Columbia Pictures)In 2018, there will be a total of eight movies based on Marvel Comics, released by&nbsp;three different studios. Marvel Studios proper will open&nbsp;Black Panther (2/16/18), Avengers: Infinity War (5/4/18), and Ant-Man and the Wasp (7/6/18); Sony will have Venom (10/5/18) and their animated Spider-Man (Miles Morales) movie (12/14/18); and Fox will have The New Mutants (4/13/18), Deadpool 2 (6/1/18), and X-Men: Dark Phoenix (11/2/18). Only the first three will be part of the “MCU“, which will expand to include 22 total movies by 2019. Earlier this week, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige revealed that 2019’s Avengers 4 (5/4/19) (the title of which is still a secret) will be the end of a 22-movie arc, and that the sequel to this week’s Spider-Man: Homecoming will be the start of the next arc when it opens&nbsp;two months later on July 3, 2019. Of course, we can only guess what exactly&nbsp;that means, but some of it is probably related to the expiring contracts of many of the original MCU stars, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner, among others.Fresh Developments1. SEVEN-TIME ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE MIKE LEIGH PLANNING HIS OWN PETERLOO(Photo by Simon Mein/Sony Classics courtesy Everett Collection)The list&nbsp;of acclaimed directors who were nominated for multiple Academy Awards but never actually won one includes such luminaries as Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Sidney Lumet, Federico Fellini, and Sergio Leone. English writer-director&nbsp;Mike Leigh, who has thus far been nominated seven times&nbsp;(twice for directing, five for writing), also belongs to that distinguished group, and his next film sounds like prime awards season material.&nbsp;Leigh’s next project will be a drama called Peterloo, about the “Peterloo Massacre” in 1819 in which the British cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000+ protestors near Manchester who were demanding parliamentary reform. Peterloo is also a production of Amazon Studios, which is currently securing&nbsp;a large ensemble cast. To date, Mike Leigh has directed seven Certified Fresh feature films, and none of his films have scored lower than 83 percent on the Tomatometer.2. DIRECTOR EDGAR WRIGHT ALREADY ASKED TO WORK ON BABY DRIVER SEQUEL(Photo by Wilson Webb/TriStar)When people talk about movies being “hits” or “flops,” one of the most important factors to consider is the the budget.&nbsp;When a movie like Baby Driver&nbsp;is made for just $34 million, but&nbsp;earns more than that in its first week,&nbsp;it&nbsp;looks like a genuine box office bonanza.&nbsp;All of that (plus its 97 percent Tomatometer&nbsp;score) helps explain why Sony Pictures, according to director Edgar Wright, has already asked him to start working on a Baby Driver sequel screenplay. If Edgar Wright does indeed write and direct a Baby Driver 2, it will be his first sequel, because none of his Three Flavours Cornetto films (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World’s End) haven’t gotten the sequel treatment… yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;3. THE NEXT BATMAN DIRECTOR IS CONSIDERING A TRILOGY… BUT WILL BEN AFFLECK STAY ON?(Photo by Zack Snyder/Warner Bros.)Though we don’t yet have our first solo Batman movie starring Ben Affleck, it’s safe to assume Warner Bros. has franchise aspirations for the character.&nbsp;This week, while doing press for next week’s War for the Planet of the Apes, director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) mentioned that he has&nbsp;“ideas about an arc” for a Batman trilogy —&nbsp;but of course, he has to get the first one done first. Even if WB does want a new trilogy, Ben Affleck may not.&nbsp;Earlier this year, after Affleck dropped out of directing the solo Batman, rumors suggested&nbsp;that he might not sign on again, though there was this piece that suggested that was all hearsay. There is no release date yet for Affleck’s&nbsp;first solo Batman, but if production starts in the next several months, it could still make a date in 2019 or 2020.4.&nbsp;FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND… NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE SEQUEL(Photo by Warner Bros.)Filming is scheduled to start this month at Warner Bros.’ Leavesden studios in southeast England on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the tenth movie set in J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World. We found out earlier this year that Jude Law would be joining the franchise as the younger version of Albus Dumbledore, but we knew precious little about what the sequel’s story would be… until this week’s announcement. Earlier this week, Warner Bros. revealed that the second Fantastic Beasts movie will start with the escape of Johnny Depp’s Gellert Grindelwald character, leading Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) to team up with Albus Dumbledore as the chase leads them to Paris, circa 1927.&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 2 is scheduled for release on November 16th, 2018, and it will be the sixth Rowling film directed by David Yates.5. WILL SMITH WILL BE 2019’S GEMINI MAN FOR DIRECTOR ANG LEE(Photo by Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros.)Director Ang Lee had a bit of a box office and critical stumble last year with Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk, which earned him only his second Rotten Tomatometer score (and an even less impressive box office take, at just under&nbsp;$1.8 million domestically). Put bluntly, Ang Lee needs a hit right now. As it happens, so does Paramount Pictures, which has had a bad couple of years, with even their traditionally most reliable franchise, Transformers, earning&nbsp;disappointing box office numbers recently. With that in mind, Lee and Paramount are teaming up with Will Smith, who will star in the science fiction action film&nbsp;Gemini Man, which has been in development (at various companies) for 20 years now, starting at Walt Disney Pictures. Smith will play an aging NSA agent who discovers that he’s been targeted by an&nbsp;assassin who turns out to be a younger version of himself — it’s not yet known how Lee plans on depicting the young Will Smith. Paramount has scheduled Gemini Man for release on October 4, 2019.6. SAMUEL L. JACKSON TO RETURN AS NICK FURY IN CAPTAIN MARVEL IN 2019(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Studios)One of the signature tricks Marvel has used to build its cinematic universe is to cross-pollinate its films with current and future standalone stars. We see that this week with Iron Man appearing in Spider-Man: Homecoming, and later this year, Hulk will co-star in Thor: Ragnarok. We have yet to see Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel&nbsp;make an appearance in any MCU film, but Captain Marvel&nbsp;(3/8/19)&nbsp;will see the return of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, who has been absent from the last few Marvel movies after playing a major part in uniting the first several MCU heroes. We still don’t know exactly what Captain Marvel will be about, including who the villain will be or how it connects to next year’s Avengers: Infinity War (which is when we may see Brie Larson’s debut).7. FELICITY JONES TO STAR IN LIVE-ACTION SWAN LAKE(Photo by Jonathan Olley/Walt Disney Studios)Although he’s far from a household name in the USA right now, Italian director Luca Guadagnino is certainly doing some of the right things to get there someday. His first major film with mostly English-speaking actors&nbsp;was 2015’s Certified Fresh&nbsp;A Bigger Splash, and this November, Guadagnino has another film, Call Me by Your Name, with the English-language remake of Suspiria coming in 2018. For his latest film, Guadagnino will work with&nbsp;Felicity Jones (Rogue One, The Theory of Everything), who is &nbsp; Felicity Jones is attached to star in an&nbsp;untitled film inspired by Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s famous ballet Swan Lake. Tchaikovsky’s ballet was based upon Russian folk tales, but it’s unclear if Guadagnino’s adaptation will be that “literal,” or if the Swan Lake basis is more figurative. Whatever the case, he’s attracted the interest of such studios as Universal, Paramount, and Sony’s TriStar (with the auction for the rights still ongoing).8. TOM CRUISE CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF IN TOP GUN: MAVERICK IN JULY, 2019Although The Mummy didn’t open to the numbers Universal Pictures probably hoped it would, Tom Cruise himself still has plenty of reasons to be optimistic about his near future. He has Mission: Impossible 6 coming next year, and he’s also been talking a lot about the Top Gun sequel which he recently revealed will be called Top Gun: Maverick (after his pilot character’s callsign).&nbsp; This week, the sequel got a little closer to being “real” as Paramount Pictures announced a release date of July 12th, 2019. That date is indeed quite ambitious, as Paramount is now the first studio to claim that weekend, with three very big movies before and after it&nbsp;—&nbsp;Universal Pictures has chosen Wednesday, July 3rd for their Secret Life of Pets sequel, Sony has scheduled their Spider-Man: Homecoming sequel for July 5th, and Disney has their remake of The Lion King scheduled for July 19th, 2019. Although he hasn’t officially been announced yet, it’s expected that the Top Gun sequel’s director will be Joseph Kosinski (TRON: Legacy), who previously directed Tom Cruise in 2013’s Oblivion.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1. THE GRUDGE&nbsp;WILL GET ANOTHER ENGLISH-LANGUAGE REMAKE(Photo by Columbia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Just enough critics liked the original 2000 Japanese horror film Ju-On: The Grudge to give it a Fresh Tomatometer score, but the 2004 English-language remake starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, its 2006 sequel, and the Japanese sequel all received Rotten scores (the most recent of which scored&nbsp;just 16 percent). Despite all of that&nbsp;(and that’s not even counting all of the other films), producer Sam Raimi and his Ghost House Pictures are continuing with plans to reboot the film again. The director of the reboot of The Grudge will be Nicolas Pesce, who made his feature film debut last year with another horror film, The Eyes of My Mother. That film was indeed Certified Fresh at&nbsp;75 percent, but we’re still a little skeptical that the world is still clamoring for another iteration of&nbsp;The Grudge.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"blaxploitation, laika, Disney, 2016, Freeform","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/07160303/Spider-Man-Homecoming-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"spider-man-homecoming-sequel-will-kick-off-next-marvel-story-arc-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509188766077","title":"Samuel L.

Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Jurassic World 2, The Lion King, and new roles for Kevin Hart, Ewan McGregor, and Will Smith.This WEEK’S TOP STORYSAMUEL L. JACKSON TO STAR IN&nbsp;UNBREAKABLE SEQUEL&nbsp;GLASSFirst off, before you continue reading&nbsp;this story, please be advised that it&nbsp;contains a spoiler for a movie that is not Unbreakable. We’ll wait right here. Okay, if everyone is good to go, let’s proceed! In 2000, M. Night Shyamalan (hot off the success of The Sixth Sense) directed Unbreakable, which was marketed like another supernatural thriller, but was actually a superhero origin movie, long before superhero movies became as popular as they are now. There was talk of an Unbreakable sequel, which eventually subsided, but it jumped back into the pop culture consciousness this January when the ending of Split revealed that film to be set in the same world as Unbreakable. Well, this week, M. Night Shyamalan revealed that his next film will be called Glass, taking its title from the villain played by Samuel L. Jackson. Bruce Willis will also return (as Unbreakable&nbsp;hero David Dunn), as will James McAvoy, reprising his own villain role from Split. Universal Pictures has scheduled Glass for release on January 18, 2019.Fresh Developments1. DISNEY REVEALS BIG 2019/2020 DATES: FROZEN 2, INDIANA JONES 5, STAR WARS EPISODE IX, AND MOREWith their four part empire (Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and live-action remakes), Walt Disney Pictures is a goliath right now, and this week, we learned what the studio has in store for 2019 and 2020. The new slate includes dates for Frozen 2 (11/27/19), various untitled live-action remakes, and future Marvel movies in 2020 (potentially including&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and Doctor Strange 2). After three years of their Star Wars movies being released in December, Disney appears to be switching back to May regularly, with Star Wars Episode IX (5/24/19) coming a year after the Han Solo prequel (5/25/18). Two months later, Disney will release one of their most ambitious remakes, The Lion King (7/19/19). A few previously announced dates were pushed back, too, including&nbsp; Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2 (from 3/9/18 to 11/21/18), Indiana Jones 5 (from 2019 to July 10, 2020), and the “Jack and the Beanstalk” animated romance (the biggest move, from 11/21/18 to 11/25/20).2. DISNEY REMAKE CASTING: SETH ROGEN AS PUMBAA, EWAN MCGREGOR AS CHRISTOPHER ROBINAs long as we’re talking about Disney, the studio’s live-action remake of&nbsp;The Lion King (7/19/19) is about half cast now (Donald Glover, James Earl Jones, and maybe Beyonce), and after this week, two of the most iconic characters joined them (still no word on Scar). If the deals work out, Seth Rogen and game show host Billy Eichner&nbsp;will voice Pumbaa the warthog and Timon the meerkat, respectively. That’s right… within two years, you will (probably) find out what “Seth Rogen singing Hakuna Matata” sounds like. A less ambitious project in the same vein (maybe more like Pete’s Dragon, in terms of scale) is Christopher Robin, adapted from their Winnie the Pooh movies. Christopher Robin Milne sort of became infamous for rejecting the fame his father (and Pooh creator)&nbsp;A.A. Milne’s animal stories brought him, and it sounds like that will be part of the movie, with Ewan McGregor in talks to play the adult Christopher Robin.3. SCOTTISH EPIC OUTLAW KING TO BE A HELL OR HIGH WATER REUNIONThis time last year, few&nbsp;people were really talking about Hell or High Water, which became a true “sleeper hit” in August and went on to&nbsp;earn four Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture). For his next film, Scottish director David Mackenzie is adapting one of his homeland’s greatest historical figures (for what will be a Netflix exclusive). The movie, called Outlaw King, is also going to be a reunion film for Hell or High Water stars Chris Pine and Ben Foster (no word yet about Jeff Bridges). Pine (Star Trek) is in talks to star as Robert the Bruce, with Ben Foster expected to play James Douglas, a Scottish knight who served as an advisor. If the name “Robert the Bruce” sounds familiar to you (and you’re not a Scottish history buff), it might be because his character appeared in&nbsp;Braveheart. The focus of that movie, William Wallace, will probably be a supporting character in Outlaw King, which&nbsp;will be centered on Robert the Bruce.4. FOX REVEALS DATES FOR DEADPOOL 2, THE NEW MUTANTS, FOUR AVATAR SEQUELS, AND MORE20th Century Fox also revealed over a dozen release dates this week, and if you saw only one social media post on this subject, it was probably about Fox’s ambitious plans for their “X-titles” in 2018, beginning with The New Mutants on April 14, 2018, from director Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars). The Deadpool sequel (featuring Josh Brolin as Cable) will be released on June 1, and the next “proper” X-Men movie will be released on November 2. That film, Dark Phoenix, will retell the same story we already saw in X-Men: The Last Stand, except it sounds like it will have a more “cosmic” setting (like the original comics story). Of the rest of Fox’s new dates, the highest profile are James Cameron’s four Avatar sequels, which now all have December dates in the years 2020, 2021, 2024, and 2025. Other Fox movies with new release dates include The Predator, Maze Runner: The Death Cure, Jennifer Lawrence’s Red Sparrow, Steven Spielberg’s untitled Pentagon Papers drama, and the Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody.5. JEFF GOLDBLUM TO RETURN IN JURASSIC WORLD 2Because you’ve already read the title, you know what this story’s about, but humor us as we fill up the rest of the requisite text here. Although Jurassic World was relatively light on returning characters (basically just B.D. Wong), for the sequel, Universal Pictures is bringing back a&nbsp;franchise favorite. Jeff Goldblum is now attached to reprise his character Dr. Ian Malcolm in the Jurassic World sequel, which will be his third film in the franchise (following the original&nbsp;Jurassic Park and&nbsp;The Lost World: Jurassic Park). The fifth film in the Jurassic Park franchise will be directed by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible, A Monster Calls), and Universal Pictures has scheduled it for June 22, 2018. Goldblum will also join the Marvel Cinematic Universe later this year as the Grandmaster in Thor: Ragnarok (11/3/17).6. WILL SMITH (AND WILL SMITH!) TO STAR IN CLONE ASSASSIN MOVIE GEMINI MANIn any given week, there are so many new movies announced that many of them inevitably never get made… but in some cases, that’s only true until they do. Consider, for example, the action movie Gemini Man, which first made the news 20 years ago in 1997. It’s officially back now, with Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Life of Pi) in advanced talks to direct it for Skydance. And for a movie that sat around that long, it&nbsp;moved pretty quickly this week, making a second announcement about who’s going to play the title role. Will Smith is now in talks to star&nbsp;in Gemini Man&nbsp;as “an aging assassin who finds himself in a battle with the ultimate opponent: his clone, who is 25 years younger and at the peak of his abilities.” Smith also recently played the assassin Deadshot in Suicide Squad (and is also expected to reprise that role in a sequel or spinoff someday).s7. MADONNA BIOPIC BLOND AMBITION MOVES FORWARD (MUCH TO HER CHAGRIN)Though biopics are sometimes made of people who are still alive (such as Erin Brockovich and Stephen Hawking), it’s far more common&nbsp;for them to be made posthumously. The second half of this particular story might help demonstrate why that’s sometimes the case. You see, the top voted title in last year’s Black List of Unproduced Screenplays was Blond Ambition, a script by Elise Hollander about Madonna’s early pre-fame years in New York City in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Universal Pictures has had success with a few musical biopics (like Straight Outta Compton), so, unsurprisingly, the studio this week picked up the rights to Blond Ambition. Madonna herself replied soon after via Instagram, “Nobody knows what I know and what I have seen. Only I can tell my story.” If there’s a bright side for the pop icon, it might be that this poll suggests people think she should be played by her daughter, Lourdes Leon (Madonna wasn’t blonde when she went to NYC, hence the ambition).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. KEVIN HART TO STAR IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS REMAKEAs the current wave of remakes continues to plunder the 1980s and 1990s, one revered filmmaker whose filmography has remained relatively untouched is the late John Hughes (except for National Lampoon’s Vacation, which he wrote, and which was rebooted in 2015). That may all change, though, if this news this week is any indication (and again, it’s another film that Hughes wrote, but didn’t direct). Universal Pictures is now developing a remake of the 1988 comedy The Great Outdoors, which starred Dan Aykroyd and John Candy as two Chicago brothers-in-law who vacation together in a cabin in rural Wisconsin. To that end, Universal has already attached Kevin Hart to play one of the two leads. We’re calling this one a Rotten Idea because a) nobody’s asking for a remake of&nbsp; The Great Outdoors, and b) Kevin Hart’s Tomatometer looks like this (it’s getting better, but he&nbsp;still has scores like Get Hard, Ride Along 2, and The Wedding Ringer).1.&nbsp;STRANGER THINGS INSPIRATION FIRESTARTER TO GET REMADELast year’s hit Netflix series Stranger Things took filmmaking and storytelling inspiration from several 1980s movies, including E.T. the Extraterrestrial, The Goonies, and Stand By Me. Another was the 1984 adaptation of Stephen King’s Firestarter, which starred a very young Drew Barrymore and probably flew under the radar of a lot of today’s young moviegoers. It also might just be the film&nbsp;with the strongest fingerprints all over Stranger Things season 1 — both center on young girls held captive in government facilities while their powerful mental powers are being studied… and then bad things happen. So, of course, Universal Pictures and Blumhouse are now developing a Firestarter remake. The director attached is Akiva Goldsman, who made his feature debut with Winter’s Tale (13 percent) and whose sci-fi/horror screenwriting credits include The 5th Wave (16 percent), Insurgent (29 percent), Rings (6 percent), and the 1997 movie that nearly killed a franchise, Batman &amp; Robin (11% Rotten).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"FX, emmy, Sundance, TV, asian-american, The, foreign, child's, football, History, Marvel, Spectrum, scary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/28124917/Unbreakable-Glass-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"samuel-l-jackson-to-star-in-unbrekable-sequel-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509188764028","title":"Jordan Peele Signs a First-Look Deal with Universal Pictures, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jordan Peele Signs a First-Look Deal with Universal Pictures, and More Movie NewsKingsman 3 is in the works, Melissa McCarthy teams up with a puppet, Chris Pine and Michelle Williams are spies, and Will Ferrell and Jason Momoa are father and son.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 5, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as A Bad Moms Christmas, Gears of War, Kingsman 3, and new roles for Will Ferrell, Melissa McCarthy, and Seth Rogen.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJORDAN PEELE TO DIRECT ANOTHER TIMELY THRILLER? GET OUT!Universal PicturesEarlier this Spring, some fans of were surprised to learn that Warner Bros was reportedly in talks with Jordan Peele (one half of comedy duo Key &amp; Peele and the writer/director of this year’s early surprise hit Get Out) to direct their super long-in-development live-action remake of the anime classic Akira. That still might happen, but we now know it won’t be Peele’s&nbsp;next movie. Instead, he’s&nbsp;signed a two year first-look deal with Universal Pictures, and his next film will be another “social thriller,” presumably in the style of Get Out&nbsp;(which was also distributed by Universal). Peele will write, direct, and produce the yet untitled film, which will have a&nbsp;&nbsp;budget of $25 million, five times the amount Peele had work with for&nbsp;Get Out (which globally has earned $194 million to date).Fresh Developments1. CHRIS PINE, MICHELLE WILLIAMS, AND ALL THE OLD KNIVESLorey Sebastian/CBS Films; Nicole Rivelli/IFC FilmsJust last week, we&nbsp;reported on a Scottish historical epic called Outlaw King, which will be something of a Hell or High Water reunion project (same director, same stars). Well, Chris Pine’s been busy lately, because we have another movie of his to report. Pine (Star Trek) and Michelle Williams (Manchester by the Sea) are now in talks to star in spy thriller called All the Old Knives, adapted by author Olen Steinhauer from his own novel about two spies (one current, one former) and ex-lovers who reunite over memories about “the disastrous hijacking of Royal Jordanian Flight 127, which ended in the death of all on board, a failure that haunts the CIA’s Vienna station to this day.” (RJ 127 is, by the way, a real flight, which doesn’t make this movie at all creepy.)&nbsp; Director James Marsh (The Theory of Everything, Wisconsin Death Trip) is in talks to direct All the Old Knives, and it’s his Tomatometer that gives&nbsp;All the Old Knives its prominent Fresh status.2. KINGSMAN 3 ALREADY PLANNED AS POTENTIAL TRILOGY FINALEJaap Buitendijk/20th Century FoxNot only is Kingsman: The Golden Circle (9/22/17) still over four months away from release, but it was only last week that we saw the film’s first trailer. Even so, we live in a world where franchises are planned even before the release of the first movie, so this story won’t&nbsp;be much of a surprise. Speaking at an event in London, director Matthew Vaughn revealed that he and screenwriter Jane Goldman have already started work on the third Kingsman screenplay. Much like Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;Vol. 2, Matthew Vaughn describes Kingsman: The Golden Circle as a “bridge” film, the franchise’s own Empire Strikes Back. He&nbsp;described the second film’s new spy agency, the Statesman, as being “to Americana what Kingsman is to Britannia.” What that might mean for the third film is anyone’s guess, but it’s reasonable to assume it might involve a third agency, possibly from an Asian country&nbsp;(or another region)? Unfortuntely, Mark Millar’s The Secret Service comic series isn’t of much help, because it ended where the first movie did.3. SETH ROGEN AND THE LONELY ISLAND TEAM UP FOR MUSIC FESTIVAL COMEDYGregorio Binuya/Everett CollectionThe past week has not been a good one for rapper Ja Rule and his partners on the now infamous&nbsp;Fyre Festival, which was&nbsp;originally planned as a luxury music festival on the Bahamian island of Great Exuma.&nbsp;Everything came apart in a series of revelations&nbsp;from would-be attendees who were left stranded on the island with few accommodations, leading to at least three lawsuits, one of them potentially worth $100 million. In the midst of all of this, Seth Rogen took to Twitter to say:&nbsp;“This seems like a good time to mention the movie we are making with @thelonelyisland about a music festival that goes HORRIBLY WRONG.” The Lonely Island (AKA the comedy trio of Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone) likewise soon also tweeted, “For real, thinking about suing #FyreFestival for stealing our idea.” Rogen previously worked with the members of The Lonely Island on The Watch and Neighbors, and the first Lonely Island movie was last year’s&nbsp;Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping.4. MELISSA MCCARTHY TO STAR IN R-RATED PUPPET COMEDY THE HAPPYTIME MURDERSHopper Stone/Columbia PicturesBack in 2010, we first learned about a dark puppet comedy called The Happytime Murders, to be directed by Brian Henson (Jim’s son) and produced by the Jim Henson Company. The premise was described this way: “Happytime takes place in a world where humans and puppets co-exist, with the puppets viewed as second-class citizens. When the puppet cast of an ’80s children’s TV show called The Happytime Gang begins to get murdered one by one, a disgraced LAPD detective-turned-private eye puppet — with a drinking problem, no less — takes on the case with his former human partner. Think Avenue Q meets L.A. Confidential.” We can now report that the human detective will be played by Melissa McCarthy.&nbsp;The Happytime Murders, which was previously at Lionsgate, will now be released by STX Entertainment, with the extensive puppet work still being handled by the Jim Henson Company. Jamie Foxx had previously been in talks for the same role, so the casting of Melissa McCarthy is something of a surprise.5.&nbsp;WILL FERRELL AND JASON MOMOA HEADLINE NEW COMEDY AS&nbsp;FATHER AND SON (SORT OF)Warner Bros.; Quantrell D. Colbert/MCSome actors and actresses fight it, but Will Ferrell (who turns 50 this July) seems to be fully embracing a new career as a movie dad. Ferrell played the dad in The LEGO Movie, he and Mark Wahlberg starred together in 2015’s Daddy’s Home (and its sequel, opening in November), and he and Amy Poehler play the parents of a teen daughter in this summer’s The House. Even so, it’s one thing to play the father of younger children, and then there’s this week’s news. But first, some math: Jason Momoa was born in 1979, making him a member of Generation X, and Will Ferrell just (barely) 19 when he was born. That’s right, there is now an untitled comedy project in which Will Ferrell and Jason Momoa will play father and son (sort of). Ferrell will play a washed up former TV star who reunites with the actor who played his son on the show, who is also now a much, much bigger star. Of course, young actors often play characters much younger than themselves, so it’s possible the screenwriters have this all figured out.6. RIDLEY SCOTT CONFIRMS THAT REVISIONIST ALIEN 5 PROJECT IS OFFICIALLY DEADMark Rogers/20th Century FoxYou may be familiar with director Neill Blomkamp’s (District 9, Chappie)&nbsp;frequently reported plans for Alien 5, which, until relatively recently, he&nbsp;was still claiming would be&nbsp;possible alongside this month’s Alien: Covenant (5/19/17). Blomkamp’s plans were always sort of confusing, because the concept art teased the return of characters that had died in previous movies. One person who seems very familiar with all of this is Alien creator and director Ridley Scott, who still&nbsp;has another film planned after Alien: Covenant. Well, Scott has officially commented on Blomkamp’s project, basically confirming that it’s not going to happen: “There was never a screenplay, just an idea that evolved into a pitch of 10 pages… I was always just a producer, but it didn’t go any further because Fox decided that it didn’t want to do it.” As for Blomkamp’s next film, we don’t know much, but he did tease the world with this last September. We’re calling this a borderline Fresh Development, because, well, bringing back two popular dead characters never seemed like a great idea.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. SARANDON, HINES, AND BARANSKI ARE BAD MOMS TO THE BAD MOMSSTX EntertainmentWhen the aforementioned Daddy’s Home sequel hits theaters this November 10th, we’ll be introduced to the two paternal grandpas played by Mel Gibson and John Lithgow (fathers to Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell, respectively). This week, we learned that A Bad Moms Christmas&nbsp;— the sequel to last year’s Bad Moms&nbsp;that opens just one week before&nbsp;Daddy’s Home 2, on&nbsp;November 3 — will also&nbsp;feature the mothers of the characters from the first movie. The three new grandmas&nbsp;will be played by Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski (The Good Wife), and the baby of the three, Cheryl Hines (Curb Your Enthusiasm), the mothers of Kathryn Hahn, Mila Kunis, and Kristen Bell. The last pairing is particularly tight, as Cheryl Hines (born 1965) was only 15 when Kristen Bell was born (1980); as with the Will Ferrell-Jason Momoa movie, that might be part of the joke. Last year’s Bad Moms was a borderline Rotten movie with a Tomatometer score of 58 percent.2. RUH-ROH, THE ANIMATED SCOOBY&nbsp;MOVIE PUSHED BACK TWO YEARSSometimes, when movies are pushed back a year or two, it’s devastating to millions of fans who were eagerly anticipating it, but other times, hardly anyone was&nbsp;even aware the film was in the works at all. In the latter category, you can probably chalk up&nbsp;Warner Bros’ plans to revive Scooby-Doo with a new animated feature film. Yes, columns like the Weekly Ketchup reported on the movie a few years ago, but it wasn’t one people were socially networking about, especially when you consider it&nbsp;was still another 17 months from release. Well, Warner Bros has a lot more time to build that sort of awareness now, because the studio has officially bumped the animated reboot, simply titled Scooby,&nbsp;back almost two years to May 15, 2020. Director Tony Cervone (who’s mostly worked on animated TV shows) is now on board to direct Scooby, apparently replacing Dax Shepard, following the disappointing release of CHiPS in March. We’re calling this a Rotten Idea, because after the two disappointing live-action movies, animation does seem the way to go with Scooby and friends.1. ARE THE GEARS OF WAR GRINDING TOWARDS ANOTHER ROTTEN VIDEO GAME MOVIE?gearsofwar.comDespite some temporary promise last year from titles like Warcraft, The Angry Birds Movie, and Assassin’s Creed, we still have yet to see&nbsp;a video game adaptation with a Fresh Tomatometer score. And yet, a steady flow of video game movies continues to make the news each year. One popular franchise is Gears of War, a third-person shooter five games deep on the XBox that pits&nbsp;human soldiers against a race of&nbsp;reptilian aliens confusingly called the Locust Horde. As of this week, we know who’s going to start working on the project, as Universal Pictures has hired screenwriter Shane Salerno, whose past credits include Armageddon, Aliens vs Predator: Requiem, and the recent video game Ghost Recon: Wildlands. Salerno is also working with James Cameron on the four Avatar sequels recently scheduled for December dates in 2020, 2021, 2024, and 2024.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Christmas, Winter, MCU, Video, free, ratings, spy, drama, Access, YouTube, anthology, furious, Bros.","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/05120735/Jordan-Peele-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"jordan-peele-signs-a-first-look-deal-with-universal-pictures-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509188759929","title":"Joss Whedon Replaces Grieving Zack Snyder On Justice League, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Joss Whedon Replaces Grieving Zack Snyder On Justice League, and More Movie NewsAn old meme inspires a new film, Top Gun 2 is still on, Tom Holland lands Uncharted, and Resident Evil plans a new... sextology?by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 26, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Justice League, The New Mutants, and new sequels for The Boss Baby, Mamma Mia!, and Tyler Perry’s Boo! A Madea Halloween.This WEEK’S TOP STORYAVENGERS DIRECTOR JOSS WHEDON TAKES OVER JUSTICE LEAGUE(Photo by Jay Maidment/Walt Disney Pictures, Simon Cardwell/Warner Bros. Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)This week, we learned that on March 20th, director Zack Snyder’s 20-year-old daughter, the young activist Autumn Snyder (creator of the Write-a-Thon charity),&nbsp;committed suicide.&nbsp;As Snyder, his wife Deborah (producer and frequent partner on his films), and the rest of their family continue to grieve Autumn’s death, the couple are stepping away from their next film, WB and DC’s Justice League (scheduled for release on November 17). Joss Whedon (Marvel’s Avengers, TV’s Buffy the Vampire Slayer) is now stepping in to continue the directing duties on Justice League as the production is set to commence a series of reshoots&nbsp;written by&nbsp;Whedon.&nbsp;Justice League will be Whedon’s first DC Comics project, but it’s his second announced for DC, after Batgirl (which was announced on March 30, 10 days after Autumn Snyder’s death). It is not yet known if Zack Snyder will direct another DC Comics adaptation after his work on Justice League, but he had originally been attached to&nbsp;the second Justice League film as well. (Footnote: This story about the Justice League reshoots also broke this week, just hours before the Joss Whedon news.)Fresh Developments1. AVA DUVERNAY TO DIRECT RIHANNA/LUPITA NYONG’O FILM INSPIRED BY A TWITTER MEME(Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)There have obviously been movies and TV shows&nbsp;inspired by Internet pop culture before, but this week, we learned of a particularly strange and funny&nbsp;example. Let’s start at the beginning. In 2014, an image was posted to Tumblr of pop singer Rihanna and actress Lupita N’yongo at a Miu Miu fashion show. The Tumblr caption read, “They look like they’re in a heist movie with Rihanna as the tough-as-nails leader/master thief and Lupita as the genius computer hacker.” Can you guess where this is going?&nbsp; This week, we learned that director Ava DuVernay&nbsp;(Selma, next year’s A Wrinkle in Time, scheduled for 3/9/18) has signed a deal with Netflix to direct a film for the streaming service in which Rihanna will play a master thief planning a heist, and Lupita Nyong’o will play a genius computer hacker. The meme-inspired movie is probably at least a year (or two) away from release; in the meantime, Rihanna will costar in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&nbsp;and next year’s Ocean’s Eight. Lupita Nyong’o’s upcoming films include this December’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi (reprising her role as Maz Kanata), and next year’s Black Panther.2. THIS WEEK IN MARVEL NEWS: THE NEW MUTANTS, SILVER AND BLACK, DEADPOOL 2 VILLAIN(Photo by Steve Dietl/Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)We’re now less than a year out from 20th Century Fox’s The New Mutants, an&nbsp;X-Men spinoff previously described as a&nbsp;“Young Adult” movie (it will be directed by Josh Boone, of The Fault in Our Stars). With filming scheduled to start soon, we can now report that The New Mutants will be “a full-fledged horror movie set within the X-Men universe… There are no costumes. There are no supervillains.” Considering we’ve known that they’re adapting the “Demon Bear Saga”, that’s not really that surprising. What’s more surprising is that Rosario Dawson (who ties Netflix’s Marvel shows together as Night Nurse Claire Temple) is now in talks to co-star in The New Mutants as Dr. Cecilia Reyes, who in the comics was once a member of the X-Men. We also heard about some Deadpool 2 casting this week, in that Jack Kesy (TV’s The Strain) is now in talks to play a villain who might be Black Tom Cassidy. And finally, Sony has hired director Gina Prince-Bythewood (The Secret Life of Bees) to work on their second Spider-Man (they’re-not-calling-it-a-) spinoff, Silver and Black, about the adventures of Silver Sable and Black Cat. Prince-Bythewood also recently directed the pilot episode of Marvel’s upcoming Cloak and Dagger TV series on Freeform.3. JESSICA CHASTAIN LANDS THE TITULAR ROLE IN BIOPIC SEDUCING INGRID BERGMAN(Photo by Richard Foreman Jr./Weinstein Company courtesy Everett Collection)We are far enough from Hollywood’s golden age that the closest modern audiences have gotten to seeing classic Hollywood stars on the big screen is when they’re played by other actors. We’re thinking, for example, of Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn, or Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale as Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner in Martin Scorsese’s The Aviator.&nbsp; Most recently, it was announced&nbsp;this week&nbsp;that Jessica Chastain will produce and star in Seducing Ingrid Bergman as the titular star of Casablanca in the true story of her romance with famed WWII photojournalist Robert Capa. The role of Capa has not been cast yet, and the film also does not yet have a director.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK6. REMEMBER THAT ABBA MOVIE MAMMA MIA?&nbsp;HERE WE GO AGAIN!(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)When it comes to movie news, release dates aren’t typically the first thing we hear about, but it&nbsp;does sometimes happen, as we saw (at least) twice this week. Probably the most surprising was the late breaking news on Friday that Universal Pictures has scheduled Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again! for release on July 20th, 2018. So, yes, 10 years after the first ABBA musical adaptation gave Universal a summer hit, they’re bringing&nbsp;Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan back for a sequel. Not much else is known yet, except that it&nbsp;will be directed and written by Ol Parker (screenwriter of the two Best Exotic Marigold Hotel movies), and will feature various ABBA songs which weren’t in the first&nbsp;movie. There were a lot of ABBA songs in that movie, so it should be interesting to see how deep into their&nbsp;catalog the sequel will dive. The original Mamma Mia! has a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 54 percent.5. ALEC BALDWIN TO RETURN AS THE BOSS BABY (2) IN 2021(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)If you go back and think about what films were&nbsp;expected to become early 2017 box office hits, DreamWorks’ The Boss Baby was barely a blip on the radar for most pundits. And yet, the movie did indeed become quite a hit for 20th Century Fox (just before DreamWorks Animation transitioned over to Universal Pictures).&nbsp;The Boss Baby is currently the #6 worldwide hit, with a global take right now at just over $468 million (in between Kong: Skull Island and Fifty Shades Darker). So, like the aforementioned Mamma Mia! sequel, we also learned this week about The Boss Baby 2 (working title) via its release date, which will be March 26th, 2021.&nbsp;The Boss Baby was DreamWorks Animation’s biggest non-sequel box office hit since 2013’s The Croods (which at one point was going to get a sequel — that plan has since been scrapped). Alec Baldwin is expected to return as the voice of&nbsp;the titular infant,&nbsp;but little else is known about the sequel’s potential premise.&nbsp;The Boss Baby received a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 52 percent.4. TOM CRUISE CONFIRMS TOP GUN 2 STARTS FILMING NEXT YEARIn August of 2012, Hollywood mourned the loss of director&nbsp;Tony Scott&nbsp;(Enemy of the State,&nbsp;Man on Fire,&nbsp;Unstoppable)&nbsp;to suicide.&nbsp;In the aftermath of his death, we learned that Scott had spent his final days with Tom Cruise, scouting locations for Top Gun 2, with production scheduled&nbsp;to start in 2013. This week, Cruise made quite a bit of news (you may have seen this on your social media) with the proclamation that the Top Gun movie is indeed still happening, with filming now scheduled to start in 2018. In this sequel, Cruise’s “Maverick” will reportedly play a modern “drone” pilot to a whole new generation of pilots. As for who might direct this Top Gun sequel, the top contender is Joseph Kosinksi, who previously worked with Tom Cruise on the sci-fi movie Oblivion (which like his first film, Tron: Legacy, earned Kosinksi a Rotten Tomatometer score).3. MARVEL’S YOUNG SPIDER-MAN ALSO CAST AS YOUNG NATHAN DRAKE IN THE UNCHARTED MOVIE(Photo by Jonathan Prime/Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)The video game adaptation Uncharted has been in development at Sony Pictures for several years now, as evidenced by this piece from MTV back in 2009 predicting that Nathan Drake could be played by Nathan Fillion. Mark Wahlberg&nbsp;might have come closer, but we heard about his departure in December. This week, we heard news that might explain why neither of these 40-something stars will be Nathan Drake (at least not in the first movie). Sony Pictures is going younger — much younger — and making the Uncharted movie a prequel showing how Nathan Drake became the adventurer we know from the games (similar to next year’s Tomb Raider movie, starring Alicia Vikander). We know that because Sony has cast 20-year-old Tom Holland, who is also starring in Sony’s Spider-Man: Homecoming this summer.&nbsp;Uncharted will be directed by Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum, Real Steel), which gives this story two reasons for being Rotten: Levy’s own&nbsp;Tomatometer, and the awful track record for video game movies&nbsp;in general.2. AFTER SIX “ROTTEN” RESIDENT EVIL MOVIES… HERE COME SIX MORE!(Photo by Brenden-John Bugatti/Screen Gems courtesy Everett Collection)Earlier this year, director Paul W.S. Anderson and his wife Milla Jovovich wrapped their sixth film in the&nbsp;Resident Evil franchise with Resident Evil: The Final Chapter. The curious thing about the&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;is that, because each sequel spun off Alice’s original story from the first movie, none of them has been&nbsp;a direct adaptation of any of the&nbsp;Resident Evil&nbsp;video games. If you’ve ever thought, “Hey, they should reboot the Resident Evil franchise and actually adapt those great games,” well, then this week’s news has got you half-covered, even if it’s the less interesting half. The German production company Constantin Film, which has been behind the Resident Evil franchise all along, is now planning to reboot the series&nbsp;with another six movies. What we don’t know is whether or not the&nbsp;new movies will adapt the&nbsp;video games, or whether or not they’ll be good enough to&nbsp;break the cycle of Rotten video game adaptations mentioned in the item above.1. TYLER PERRY’S TYLER PERRY’S BOO: A MADEA HALLOWEEN RETURNS(Photo by Daniel McFadden/Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)One of the most surprising announcements early last year was the revelation that Tyler Perry was indeed turning the “joke” movie Tyler Perry’s Boo: A Madea Halloween (from Chris Rock’s Top Five) into an actual movie. Well, we received another similar surprise this week&nbsp;when&nbsp;Lionsgate announced that Tyler Perry’s Madea will return in another Halloween “horror” comedy, scheduled for October 20, 2017. This time around, “Madea, Bam, and Hattie venture to a haunted campground and the group must literally run for their lives when monsters, goblins, and the bogeyman are unleashed.” If you don’t count 2009’s I Can Do Bad All By Myself, the highest any proper&nbsp;Madea movie has ever scored on the Tomatometer is 38 percent (2011’s Madea’s Big Happy Family).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Shudder, Games, teaser, Reviews, Out, Us, hard, drama, Wars, natural, ESPN","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/26135039/Whedon-Snyder-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"joss-whedon-replaces-grieving-zack-snyder-on-justice-league-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509190239624","title":"Unlikely Team of David Gordon Green, Danny McBride, and John Carpenter Unite for Halloween Reboot, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Unlikely Team of David Gordon Green, Danny McBride, and John Carpenter Unite for Halloween Reboot, and More Movie NewsKristen Wiig and Jack Nicholson remake Toni Erdmann, M. Night Shyamalan promises a Split sequel, and Friday the 13th and World War Z are shelved.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 10, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as new Halloween and Jay and Silent Bob movies, director M. Night Shyamalan’s next film, and new roles for Matthew McConaughey and Keanu Reeves.This WEEK’S TOP STORYWACKY YOUR HIGHNESS TEAM REUNITE FOR THE NEXT HALLOWEEN REBOOTThe Halloween franchise has always had a certain twisted chronology to it, mostly due to the third installment‘s singular departure from the Michael Myers narrative. After the original franchise completed an eight-movie run, director Rob Zombie took over Halloween for a reboot in 2007, followed by a sequel of its own&nbsp;in 2009. This year marks the 10th anniversary of that reboot, which apparently has been enough time for Miramax to start development on a third version of Halloween. The good news is that, after a long absence from most of the franchise, John Carpenter&nbsp;is back on board as at least an executive producer, and possibly also as the film’s composer. As part of his new role as the shepherding the next Halloween, Carpenter took to his Facebook profile this week to make the project’s first big announcement, which was that the new film&nbsp;will be directed by David Gordon Green&nbsp;and cowritten by Green and his Your Highness partner, Danny McBride. Green is definitely one of those directors who defies easy categorization. Although his most famous films are “stoner comedies” like Pineapple Express and Your Highness, his filmography also includes critically acclaimed indie hits like George Washington, All the Real Girls, and Prince Avalanche (and indeed, his Tomatometer looks a lot more Fresh without his comedies). Of course, none of these films are horror and/or slasher films, but Rob Zombie’s did, and his two Halloween movies ended up with Tomatometer scores of 25 percent and 19 percent, so who knows?&nbsp;Miramax has scheduled the new Halloween reboot for release on October 19, 2018.Fresh Developments1. M. NIGHT SHYMALAN FOLLOWS SPLIT TWIST WITH SEQUEL REVEALLooking ahead, it appears extremely likely that the top movie will be either The LEGO Batman Movie or Fifty Shades Darker (as of this writing, the latter has&nbsp;taken #1 in the Thursday night previews) this weekend. It will also mark the end of the three-week chart-topping run for M. Night Shyamalan’s kidnapping thriller Split, starring James McAvoy as a man with dissociative identity disorder. Shyamalan is famous for twists in the third act, and sure enough, Split had one of them. With that in mind, this is a good point to state that this week’s news could reveal spoilers about Split, especially if you follow the links, so proceed with caution. On Saturday night, Shyamalan tweeted, “I have an 11 page outline for my next film in my bag. I can’t tell you what it is, but If you’ve seen #Split…” Head over to Collider&nbsp;for more on that&nbsp;and what it (probably) means for the sequel. Of course, once this new sequel starts filming, the casting news will probably give it away.2. MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY TO CHILL AS THE BEACH BUMThis spring will mark four years now since the release of the 2013 indie hit Spring Breakers, which also marked the point at which director Harmony Korine (Gummo, julien donkey-boy) expanded into more commerical material. Ever since Spring Breakers, the film that Korine was expected to direct next was a crime drama called The Trap. That film has had a few big names associated with it (or not), including Benicio Del Toro, Al Pacino, Idris Elba, and Robert Pattinson, but it appears that planned filming start dates have come and gone a few times. This week, we instead heard from the Berlin International Film Festival about a new film project from Korine, and along with him, a completely different major film star as the lead. Matthew McConaughey is now attached to star in an comedy called The Beach Bum, which Harmony Korine will both write and direct. Although we don’t know precise details about the premise, the title offers a hint, as does this byline: “[The Beach Bum] follows the hilarious misadventures of Moondog, a rebellious and lovable rogue who lives life large.” In many of his films (Mud, The Wolf of Wall Street), Matthew McConaughey obviously brought a very relaxed vibe to the table, so his being cast in a movie called The Beach Bum might arguably be called something of a no-brainer. The next question is whether McConaughey will receive any makeover comparable to that crazy grill that James Franco had in his mouth in Spring Breakers.3. THIS WEEK IN JACK NICHOLSON REMAKES: TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, TONI ERDMANNEvery year around this time, the Berlin International Film Festival ensures that the Weekly Ketchup has an unusually high number of film development stories to choose from. To avoid expanding beyond our usual ten headlines, we’ll pair a couple of them here.&nbsp;Both of these stories are about remakes, and Jack Nicholson is associated with each of them (sort of). Let’s start off with the less obvious one: Oprah Winfrey is now attached to star in a remake of the 1983 Best Picture winner Terms of Endearment, which Lee Daniels (Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire,&nbsp;Lee Daniels’ The Butler) is in talks to direct. Winfrey, who co-starred in Daniels’ The Butler,&nbsp;will star in the role&nbsp;that won Shirley MacLaine her Best Actress Oscar, a mother locked in decades of stormy relations with her daughter, who is also starting a relationship with a retired astronaut (originally played by Jack Nicholson). As for the other news involving Jack Nicholson, it’s the English-language remake of the German film Toni Erdmann, which is nominated for Best Foreign Language Film in this year’s Academy Awards. Like Terms of Endearment, this remake is also based at Paramount Pictures, which acuired it, apparently, with both Jack Nicholson and Kristen Wiig (as the title character) attached to star. A screenwriter and director have yet to be named.DWAYNE JOHNSON RETURNS TO WRESTLING IN&nbsp;FIGHTING WITH MY FAMILYWe’re now dozens of movies into his career as a movie star, so it might now be difficult to imagine that there was once a time when Dwayne Johnson was thought of first as “The Rock,” or perhaps as Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. That name, of course, was the handle he used in his previous career as a professional wrestler. Now, just as the world is starting to think him first as a movie star, Johnson is ready to return once again to the world of wrestling… on the big screen. The movie in question is a British true story drama called Fighting With My Family, and it’s based on the life story of female wrestler Paige. Johnson’s role will be as himself, and is described as a “cameo,” but it’s also being used as the main announcement for Fighting With My Family, so presumably, his&nbsp;role will be used to sell the actual release as well.&nbsp;Fighting With My Family will be directed by Stephen Merchant (The Office, Hello Ladies: The Movie), who will also soon be seen in Logan as the mutant Caliban.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK5. PARAMOUNT PULLS THE FRIDAY THE 13TH PAGE OFF THEIR STUDIO CALENDARSpeaking of reboots of long-running horror franchises, what are the chances that Halloween and Friday the 13th would make the news in the same week? Pretty good, as it turns out, but in the case of Friday the 13th, the news isn’t particularly positive. Instead of an optimistic announcement from the franchise’s creator, the Friday the 13th news came from its parent studio, Paramount, which has given up on it after several years of development. After previously being considered for at least two other “Friday the 13th” release dates, the reboot was yanked this week from Friday, October 13th, 2017 release date. Instead, Paramount is giving&nbsp;that date to&nbsp;mother! (intentional lower case), which is the previously untitled film that unites Jennifer Lawrence with acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Black Swan). Other cast members in mother! include Javier Bardem, Domhnall Gleeson, Ed Harris, and Michelle Pfeiffer. There are reportedly a few reasons why Paramount decided to give up on Friday the 13th, including its surprisingly high budget ($25 million!), the relatively disappointing opening weekend of Rings (never mind that the two horror franchises are nothing alike), and the fact that the rights will soon revert back to New Line Cinema. For fans of Jason Voorhees,&nbsp;that last bit might be a silver lining, as it’s possible NLC might actually decide to do something with&nbsp;the franchise.&nbsp;Anyway, it’s for those fans that we list this story as a “Rotten Idea.”4. &nbsp;DAVID FINCHER AND FAST ZOMBIES FAIL TO SAVE WORLD WAR ZSomeone at Paramount Pictures must have been getting a bonus for how many big franchises they could shelve in just 5 working days. In addition to the Friday the 13th reboot, the studio also pulled the long-planned sequel to 2013’s World War Z. The release date for the sequel had originally been June 9, 2017, which for a while was sort of obviously not going to happen, since filming hadn’t started. What was surprising about the&nbsp;story was that Paramount chose not to set a new release window (such as, say, sometime in the summer of 2018), which is even more baffling in light of the confirmation, via&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter, that acclaimed director David Fincher — who has directed star Brad Pitt in such films as Fight Club and Seven&nbsp;— is still interested in directing the sequel. In other Brad Pitt news, it’s already sounding like he&nbsp;might be considering moving on to the Neptune space adventure Ad Astra instead.3. YEAH, KEANU REEVES IS THINKING HE’S BACK (BEHIND THE WHEEL) IN RALLY CARIf you want to impress your friends and baffle your enemies with your amazing ability to predict a given week’s film development stories, a good place to start would be the list of theatrical new releases. There’s a good chance that a high profile film with a major star (like say, Keanu Reeves in this week’s&nbsp;John Wick: Chapter 2) will make some headlines. It just makes sense, since stars will be out&nbsp;talking to reporters, and either they or their agents/managers will want to take advantage of the press. Having said that, none of that was the case this week with Keanu Reeves’ new project, Rally Car,&nbsp;which was&nbsp;the result of a distribution rights deal that came out of the Berlin International Film Festival. In Rally Car, Reeves will star as a “a self-centered American NASCAR driver who revitalizes his career by entering an international Rally Car race across the face of China, and learns to win as part of a team when he joins forces with a young Chinese woman who yearns to become a driver herself.”You can see a few different elements that make the film attractive in today’s film industry: NASCAR for middle America, a race across China for, well, China, and a 52-year-old movie star romantically partnered with a woman in her 20s for anyone interested in middle-aged male wish fulfillment.&nbsp;Rally Car will be directed by Olivier Megaton, whose three previous films have all received quite Rotten Tomatometer scores: Transporter 3 (37 percent), Colombiana (27 percent), and Taken 2 (21 percent).2. KEVIN SMITH RETURNS TO HIS ROOTS&nbsp;WITH JAY AND SILENT BOB REBOOT2018 will mark a very special sort of 10th anniversary for director Kevin Smith;&nbsp;2008&nbsp;was the last time he directed a Fresh movie (Zack and Miri Make a Porno), despite a number of projects in which he attempted to move past the “View Askewniverse” characters and films that defined&nbsp;his early career. One has to imagine he’s getting nostalgic right about now, which is probably why he had been considering making Clerks 3 (Smith confirmed this week that it’s now “dead” again). So, how will the former Silent Bob reboot his View Askewniverse and his own film career? If you guessed, “By doing a Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,” then you guessed right, even down to&nbsp;the title. Here is what Kevin Smith had to say about the project: “And so all last month, I had the time of my life laughing while writing Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&nbsp;– a fun flick in which the Jersey boys have to go back to Hollywood to stop a brand new reboot of the old Bluntman &amp; Chronic Movie&nbsp;they hated so much. It’s a tongue-in-cheek, silly-ass satire that pokes fun at the movie business’s recent re-do obsession, featuring an all-star cast of cameos and familiar faces! And I already met with the good folks at Miramax and they’re into it, so I’m hoping we’ll be shooting in the summer!”1. SPOOFERS FRIEDBERG &amp; SELTZER TARGET STAR WARS WITH STAR WORLDSIf you thought the return of Kevin Smith to his Jay and Silent Bob characters was going to be the week’s worst example of unrequested nostalgia from a filmmaker, then you set your standards much too high. Regardless of Smith’s recent output, his films at least have their fans, and some have been well-reviewed in the past. Let’s consider, on the other hand, the careers of duo Josh Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. If those names don’t ring any bells, let’s throw out some movie titles: Epic Movie,&nbsp;Meet the Spartans,&nbsp;Vampires Suck,&nbsp;The Starving Games. Oh, and did we mention Meet the Spartans? Yes, that’s right, we’re talking about the guys who take whatever trend is popular and fill up a feature film with disjointed “jokes” and references to whatever is floating in the zeitgeist at the moment. So what could they be planning next? The title is so long that we can just give it to you now, and it says pretty much everything you need: Star Worlds Episode XXXIVE=MC2: The Force Awakens The Last Jedi Who Went Rogue. Friedberg and Seltzer expect to start filming in the fall of 2017. The farce is not strong with these two.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"movies, emmy, Creative, Network, Reality, transformers, Pop, Classic, thriller, on","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10180422/David-Gordon-Green-Danny-McBride-Halloween-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"unlikely-team-of-david-gordon-green-danny-mcbride-and-john-carpenter-unite-for-halloween-reboot-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509188776324","title":"Disney’s Live Action Aladdin Puts Out An Open Casting Call, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Disney's Live Action Aladdin Puts Out An Open Casting Call, and More Movie NewsSpielberg, Hanks, and Streep unite for fact-based drama, Deadpool finds its Domino, Avatar(s) delayed again, and new roles for Hugh Jackman, Margot Robbie, Eva Green, and Samuel L. Jackson.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 10, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Aladdin, Deadpool 2, Dumbo, and Ferrari, and new roles for Tom Hanks, Hugh Jackman, Margot Robbie, and Meryl Streep.This WEEK’S TOP STORYWANT TO JOIN A WHOLE NEW WORLD? DISNEY’S LIVE ACTION ALADDIN NOW CASTINGYoung actors looking to break out typically have a few options: start&nbsp;out in indies (or, in today’s world, the various online venues), land a role in television, win over a powerful talent agency, or achieve some combination thereof. It’s rare&nbsp;that a casting call for a major role genuinely appears to be open to any and all newcomers. Walt Disney Studios, however, has done this occasionally — see last year’s Moana, a role which eventually went to 14-year-old newcomer Auli’i Cravalho, or the recent&nbsp;casting call for their live action version of Mulan. Well, two more opportunities are now available, as studio&nbsp;is now seeking to cast the leads in their upcoming live action adaptation Aladdin. Disney is looking for candidates who are 18-25, “must be able to sing,” can play characters who are Middle Eastern, and also, “dance experience [is] a plus.” Rehearsals start next month in April, 2017, and filming will take place in the U.K. from July 2017 to January 2018 (six months!). It doesn’t yet have a release date,&nbsp;but the filming schedule suggests either late 2018 or (more likely) sometime in 2019. The film will be directed by Guy Ritchie, who previously helmed such reimaginations of classic stories as 2009’s Sherlock Holmes (and its sequel) and this May’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Disney’s next live action adaptation, Beauty and the Beast, opens&nbsp;next week (3/17/17), and you can read about another such project, Dumbo, further on in this week’s Ketchup.Fresh Developments1. POWER TRIO SPIELBERG, HANKS, AND STREEP UNITE FOR THE POSTTom Hanks and &nbsp;Steven Spielberg have made four movies together (Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, The Terminal, and Bridge of Spies), and as producers they’ve worked together on two HBO World War II miniseries (Band of Brothers and The Pacific). On the other hand, aside from providing the&nbsp;voice for a small robot role in A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Meryl Streep has never worked with the prolific director. Well, Steven Spielberg has now signed on to direct a movie called The Post, with both Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep attached to star in lead roles.&nbsp;Like Catch Me If You Can, Bridge of Spies, and Munich, The Post will be a mid-20th-century true story, covering The Washington Post’s&nbsp;role in exposing “The Pentagon Papers,” the documents that detailed&nbsp;the U.S. government’s plans for involvement in the Vietnam War. Hanks will play editor Ben Bradlee, and Streep will play publisher Kay Graham.&nbsp;The Post won’t be happening in the next year or so, however, as Spielberg is currently working on two other movies: Ready Player One (3/30/18) and the fact-based drama The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara, which might be released in late 2018 as one of The Weinstein Company’s big awards contenders. Steven Spielberg also made the news this week for teaming up with J.J. Abrams as coproducers on a movie based on a Syrian refugee’s true story, but it’s unclear who will be directing that film.2. HUGH JACKMAN ALL REVVED UP TO STAR IN MICHAEL MANN’S FERRARI BIOPICThis past weekend, Hugh Jackman made a strong exit from the X-Men franchise with&nbsp;Logan, which enjoyed a monster opening weekend.&nbsp;We’ve known for a few years now that Jackman’s first big post-Wolverine project at 20th Century Fox would be the studio’s long-in-development P.T. Barnum biopic The Greatest Showman (which recently wrapped filming and is scheduled for Christmas Day, 2017). This week, however, we also learned that it won’t be Jackman’s last biopic, either, as he is now in talks to star in the racing and automobile empire biopic Ferrari, about the life of Italy’s Enzo Ferrari, which has been a dream project for director Michael Mann for 17 years.&nbsp;Noomi Rapace is also in talks to play Ferrari’s wife Linda, and Jackman is coming to the role following the departure of Christian Bale, who had previously been long attached to star in it. Although it was a good week for this&nbsp;new Hugh Jackman project, it was also a bad week for an old one. DreamWorks Animation, as part of their ongoing acquisition by Universal and Illumimination, has now cancelled plans for an animated Australian musical called Larrikins, in which Hugh Jackman had been attached to star as the lead character’s voice.3. LUCKY ATLANTA STAR ZAZIE BEETZ WINS DOMINO ROLE IN DEADPOOL SEQUELFX’s Atlanta, which won two Golden Globes in January, has been a boon for its young stars. The show’s creator and star, Donald Glover, is the young Lando Calrissian in next year’s Han Solo prequel, and he’s landed the lead role of Simba in Disney’s new remake of The Lion King, while costar Lakeith Stanfield currently appears in the hugely successful thriller&nbsp;Get Out. This week, another Atlanta star landed a high profile gig;&nbsp;Zazie Beetz, who plays Glover’s girlfriend Vanessa on Atlanta, won the role of Domino in the upcoming&nbsp;Deadpool sequel. Just as various sites began&nbsp;to report the story, Ryan Reynolds confirmed the casting with this post on Twitter.&nbsp;Domino made her debut (sort of) in the same issue (New Mutants #98) in which Deadpool also debuted, except that it wasn’t really her (oh… comics!). The character&nbsp;has been a fan favorite pretty much ever since, and she’s also a key member of X-Force, the team which is expected to get its own spinoff movie from 20th Century Fox in the next few years. Domino’s mutant ability involves a heightened form of “good luck” — one of her names in the comics is “Beatrice,” from the Latin for “luck.” Fox hasn’t yet announced a release date for the Deadpool sequel, but the studio might assign one of its two “Untitled Fox/Marvel” slots in 2018 (June 29th and November 2nd) to it, with the other release likely to be the next X-Men&nbsp;movie.4. EVA GREEN AND DANNY DEVITO JOIN THE CRAZY CIRCUS THAT IS THE LIVE ACTION DUMBO REMAKEMuch ado was made about Walt Disney Pictures’ acquisitions of LucasFilm and Marvel Studios, but Disney also has its own separate blockbuster factory in the form of the “live action remakes” of their classic titles, the latest of which is&nbsp;next week’s Beauty and the Beast. The bigger story this week was obviously the casting call for Aladdin, but the casting process for the Dumbo remake helmed by Tim Burton also continues, and&nbsp;this week, two different actors made the news for landing human roles, beginning with Eva Green, who recently starred in Burton’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children. There’s no word yet as to which character Green will play, but she will reportedly be one of the film’s three “adult” roles.&nbsp;Danny DeVito is also in talks to join the cast as the ringmaster of the struggling circus where Dumbo is born. Finally, this week’s Eva Green news also revealed that Disney had been hoping to cast Chris Pine (Star Trek), but those negotiations fell through. It’s still unknown which role Will Smith would have played if he hadn’t dropped out, or who will be replacing him (though it sounds like it was probably the role they hoped to give to Chris Pine).5. SEBASTIAN STAN AND SAMUEL L. JACKSON WEIGH THE LAST FULL MEASUREEarlier this year, Marvel Studios started production in Atlanta on next year’s Avengers: Infinity War, which is expected to roll right into filming of the fourth Avengers movie, as part of an ambitious filming schedule using most/much of their “assembled” Marvel Cinematic Universe stars. With dozens of actors committed, what will they do on their days off? For at least two of the Avengers: Infinity War stars, the answer appears to be to film another movie at the same time. Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury) and Sebastian Stan (The Winter Soldier) signed on this week to join a political drama called The Last Full Measure. Stan has the lead role, while Jackson joins a supporting cast that includes William Hurt, Michael Imperioli, Christopher Plummer, Linus Roache, and Get Out costar Bradley Whitford. Stan will play “a Pentagon investigator who reluctantly teams with veterans of the 1966 Operation Abilene to convince Congress to award the Medal of Honor to a courageous Air Force medic, William Pitsenbarger, who is seen saving the lives of over 60 Marines ambushed in one of the bloodiest battles of the Vietnam War. As the battle waged on, and after the last helicopter left, he continued to save lives until his own was sacrificed.” (And if you’re wondering, “wait, those guys are in Avengers: Infinity War?”, you can read about their involvement here&nbsp;and here.)6. ANNA FARIS AND EUGENIO DERBEZ FALL OVERBOARD FOR ITS GENDER-SWAPPED REMAKEWhen news first broke a while back that there were plans to remake the 1987 romantic comedy Overboard, there were a few possibilities that might have been fairly reasonable guesses. For example, it was reasonable to expect&nbsp;that Kate Hudson would reprise the “spoiled rich girl” role originally played by her mom, Goldie Hawn, or that someone like Chris Pratt might be a good fit for Kurt Russell’s role. If you thought the latter, you would have been close to the right answer… sort of.&nbsp;As it turns out, the Overboard remake is not that simple; the comedy will&nbsp;be “gender swapped” this time around, focusing instead on&nbsp;the story of a “spoiled playboy from one of Mexico’s wealthiest families… who falls overboard off his yacht.” And yes, Anna Faris — Pratt’s wife — will star in the Overboard remake, but she will play a female version of Russell’s character, as a single mom who convinces the amnesiac playboy (to be played by Eugenio Derbez) that he is her husband.&nbsp;Overboard is being remade by MGM, a studio which has made something of an in-house specialty out of remakes, and it will be co-written and co-directed by Bob Fisher (cowriter of We’re the Millers) and Rob Greenberg (of TV’s How I Met Your Mother).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. MARGOT ROBBIE TO STAR IN REVISIONIST ROBIN HOOD SEQUEL AS MAID MARIANThe legends of Robin Hood continue to be a frequent source of new movies (the 2010 movie starring Russell Crowe, and the movie next year starring Taron Egerton). In 2014, there was news that Sony Pictures was developing a “Robin Hood Cinematic Universe,” which would bring us a series of movies about various supporting characters (Will Scarlett, Friar Tuck, etc) who would all share the same world. It’s unclear now if Sony will move ahead with that, but the studio definitely still plans to make at least one movie featuring a secondary Robin Hood character.&nbsp;Sony Pictures picked up the rights to a spec script called Marian, with Suicide Squad star Margot Robbie attached to star in the title role. It’s basically a sequel set in an alternate reality, because it will be set after the death of Robin Hood, with Robbie’s Marian taking over in his role instead. Or, as Deadline put it, “After a conspiracy to conquer England in which the love of her life Robin Hood dies before her eyes, Marian picks up the cause to lead her people into a pivotal war. She comes to power, charging into a battle that will not only decide the fate of the kingdom but will see her don the mantle of the man she loved.” Although she’s appeared in Fresh movies (like The Wolf of Wall Street), Margot Robbie’s recent attempts at action movies have both received Rotten Tomatometer scores (26 percent for Suicide Squad, 36 percent for The Legend of Tarzan).2. THE AVATAR SEQUELS GET PUSHED BACK AGAIN (REMEMBER WHEN JAMES CAMERON ACTUALLY MADE MOVIES?)At one point, producer and director James Cameron had plans to follow 2009’s Avatar with two sequels that would have been released in December of both 2014 and 2015. We’re now over a year past the point when&nbsp;the Avatar trilogy would have been finished, and in that time, Cameron’s plans for the franchise have only continued to grow — there are now four sequels planned.&nbsp;We were led to believe&nbsp;that, starting in December 2018, Cameron would finally deliver the next movie set on the world of Pandora, especially since Disney has been hyping up their Avatar attraction. Until, that is, Cameron confirmed that the second Avatar movie won’t be ready for release in 2018 either. Possibly having learned a&nbsp;lesson about promising concrete release dates, James Cameron now only says that he will be spending at least the next eight years on Avatar. Ostensibly, he means that, by 2025 or so, he will be done with with all of the sequels, but for all we know, eight years will just get us to Avatar 2. The original Avatar will celebrate its 10th anniversary on December 18, 2019.1. JASON MOMOA TO STAR IN JUST CAUSE VIDEO GAME MOVIE… JUST ‘CAUSEWe have yet to get a video game movie&nbsp;with a Fresh Tomatometer score, but we continue to hope&nbsp;one will come along that breaks the pattern. With that in mind, video game adaptations remain the #1 most reliable reason for us to list a news item&nbsp;as one of the week’s Rotten Ideas. This week’s most Rotten Idea — about a video game adaptation —&nbsp;is a twofer on top of that, as its star, Jason Momoa&nbsp;currently sports&nbsp;an all-Rotten streak. The news is that Momoa is now attached to star in an adaptation of the Just Cause video game franchise&nbsp;that&nbsp;will be directed by Brad Peyton, whose Tomatometer, which is also entirely Rotten,&nbsp;includes such gems as&nbsp;Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore (14 percent), Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (43 percent), and San Andreas (48 percent). The Just Cause games are best known for their focus on both “extreme sports” (like parachuting and wingsuits) and&nbsp;the standard videogame assortment of guns and other weapons. Momoa will play&nbsp;Just Cause franchise&nbsp;hero Rico Rodriguez, an operative working for a shadowy agency called… “The Agency.”","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"war, 4/20, Christmas, Apple, movies, Fire, criterion, Schmidt, kaiju, Month, cancelled, science","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/10143713/Aladdin-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"disneys-live-action-aladdin-puts-out-an-open-casting-call-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509191861657","title":"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Expands to Five Films, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Expands to Five Films, and More Movie NewsThe Coen brothers and Clint Eastwood tackle new projects, Michelle Williams takes on Janis Joplin, Guy Ritchie will helm the live-action Aladdin, and Ride Along 3 is happening.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 14, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Aladdin, Bad Dads, Don Quixote, and Ride Along 3.This WEEK’S TOP STORYFANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM TO BE FIVE MOVIESA few years ago, when Warner Bros first announced their plans to spinoff J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter franchise with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the plan (as the world knew it) was for there to be three movies, forming a new trilogy. Along the way, we also learned the release dates for those three films, which are for the first movie (next month, on November 18, 2016), the second (11/16/18), and the third (11/20/20). Well, just as Disney is planning on producing Marvel and Star Wars movies for the indefinite future, it is now looking like Warner Bros definitely has long-term plans for the “Potterverse” as well. This week, at a fan event in London, Warner Bros revealed that instead of just three Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, there will now be five.&nbsp; Warner Bros did not reveal the release dates for the 4th and 5th films, but following the pattern of the first three films, it looks like they might be released in November of the years 2022 and 2024, just before Thanksgiving each of those years. Director David Yates also revealed that the second film, which will start production soon, will be set in “another global capital city” after the first film was set in New York City. (Though we should point out, New York City is not… a capital city. The capital of New York is Albany!) Eddie Redmayne will star in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as wizard author Newt Scamander, and he is expected to also star in the four sequels.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;THE COEN BROTHERS WILL WRITE INTERNET TRUE STORY DARK WEBMost of us never see both, but there are actually two (or arguably, multiple) Internets: one is the widely public Internet, and then there are the networks known as “Darknets,” which are mostly used by criminals or other nefarious types (terrorists, racist groups, hackers, etc). One such network was called Silk Road, which was a platform for the sale of illegal drugs. All of this does indeed sound like the material for an intriguing movie, but what one might not imagine is that it would be something that would attract the interest of renowned screenwriters and directors Joel and Ethan Coen, AKA the Coen Brothers (Fargo, The Big Lebowski, Hail, Caesar!). That, however, is exactly what’s happening, because Joel and Ethan Coen have signed on with 20th Century Fox to adapt the true story of the Silk Road black market network. The Coens will be adapting this true story as a screenplay called Dark Web, based on the two part story in Wired which you can read right here.&nbsp;It is not known at this point whether the Coens might also end up directing Dark Web (they don’t always, as they did not direct Bridge of Spies, Unbroken, or the upcoming Suburbicon).2. CLINT EASTWOOD MAY DIRECT KIDNAPPING TRUE STORY IMPOSSIBLE ODDSIn his career as director, Clint Eastwood is now four movies into what is becoming a steady stream of biopics (or, at least, true story dramas): J. Edgar, Jersey Boys, American Sniper, and last month’s Sully. If the project in this week’s news ends up indeed being Clint Eastwood’s next film as director, that stretch will expand to five. Reportedly, Eastwood is now eyeing an adaptation of the book Impossible Odds, the autobiography cowritten by humanitarian aid worker Jessica Buchanan. In 2012, Jessica Buchanan was kidnapped by Somali militants, and eventually, she was rescued by Navy SEALs. The film rights to Impossible Odds have been optioned by Warner Bros, Clint Eastwood’s decades-long home studio.3. DISNEY’S LIVE ACTION ALADDIN TO BE DIRECTED BY… GUY RITCHIE?As Disney continues to delve deep into their catalog to develop more and more of their animated properites as live action remakes, we have already seen some bold directorial choices, such as Kenneth Branagh on Cinderella, the indie director of Pete’s Dragon, and Jon Favreau’s work on both The Jungle Book&nbsp;and the upcoming The Lion King. This week, however, we learned of what is arguably the most surprising director choice yet. Guy Ritchie, probably best known for his British gangster movies and the two Sherlock Holmes movies starring Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law, is in talks with Walt Disney Pictures to direct their live action remake of Aladdin. It’s easy to guess that Ritchie gained Disney’s attention because they are hoping for a “street level” approach to the story of life in their magical fantasy city of Agrabah. What’s unknown is how many of the original 1992 version‘s songs will be incorporated in Ritchie’s film.4. DISNEY TO ADAPT DON QUIXOTE AS PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN-STYLE ADVENTUREWe have in the last couple of years been hearing about so many live-action adaptations of Disney’s&nbsp;animated movies that, outside of Star Wars and the Marvel Studios movies, one couldn’t be blamed for assuming that&nbsp;Disney’s live action output might one day consist solely of those&nbsp;adaptations. Well, at least for 2017, Disney does still have one other major franchise, which is Pirates of the Caribbean, which will continue on May 26, 2017 with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.&nbsp;But what happens after Pirates&nbsp;is completely done and over with? Disney apparently has some ideas: Walt Disney Pictures is now developing a live-action adaptation of Cervantes’ Don Quixote, reportedly in the style of Pirates of the Caribbean. Set in the early 17th century, Don Quixote tells the story of an aging aristocrat who has lost his mind and sets off an adventure to defeat the forces that only exist within his own fractured mind. There is no word yet as to who might star in Don Quixote, but if one reads between the lines, it’s possible that Disney might intend&nbsp;Don Quixote to be a future vehicle for their Pirates of the Caribbean star Johnny Depp (who&nbsp;nearly starred in Terry Gilliam’s The Man Who Killed Don Quixote). Depp will be turning 60 in 2023, but even so, we already knew through his Jack Sparrow character that he&nbsp;could easily take on very different appearances. (And besides, it might not be until the early 2020s that the steam fully runs out on Pirates of the Caribbean.)5.&nbsp;MICHELLE WILLIAMS TO STAR IN JANIS JOPLIN BIOPICVarious (and multiple) interests in Hollywood have been trying to get a biopic about 1960s pop singer Janis Joplin since the 1990s. Some of the possible stars during the last twenty years mentioned or attached to play Janis Joplin have included Zooey Deschanel, Melissa Etheridge, Renee Zellweger, and the late Brittany Murphy. As of this week, it appears that the pieces are finally coming together for one of those projects to become a movie that we can all see within the next year or so. Michelle Williams, who played Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn, is now in talks to star as Janis Joplin&nbsp;in an independent drama called Janis, about the last six months of her life, before her drug overdose death in 1970 at the age of 27.&nbsp;Janis will be directed by Sean Durkin, who currently has the distinction of having four movies as either director or producer on his Tomatometer which are all Certified Fresh, including his directorial debut, the 2011 indie hit Martha Marcy May Marlene. It appears that one of the factors ultimately helping Janis win the race to production over the other possible biopics is that producer Peter Newman secured the film rights to over twenty of Janis Joplin songs (as a solo act), and the entire catalog of Big Brother and the Holding Company, the group with which Joplin also had major hits.6. BAD MOMS TO GET BAD DADS SPINOFFAlthough it opened in the #3 spot (behind Jason Bourne and Star Trek Beyond), this summer’s comedy Bad Moms sort of stealthily bubbled along through the summer, eventually earning over $112 million in domestic box office. That can be considered a solid hit for the stars of the film, namely Christina Applegate, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Mila Kunis, and Jada Pinkett Smith. One could reasonably expect a sequel to follow, but what STX Entertainment announced this week instead was a spinoff called Bad Dads. The film doesn’t have an announced cast or premise yet, but we do know that it will be released on July 14, 2017, which puts it&nbsp;directly up against War for the Planet of the Apes (and one week after Spider-Man: Homecoming). STX Entertainment also revealed that they intend on “extending the Bad Moms” brand with “a reality television show” and spinoffs (plural, as in possibly something like Bad Kids?). Bad Moms earned a (just barely) Fresh Tomatometer score of 60 percent.7. BENICIO DEL TORO DROPS OUT OF THE PREDATOR, REPLACED BY LOGAN VILLAINJust about a month ago, one of the biggest stories of the week was the news that Benicio Del Toro was in talks to star in The Predator. As the title suggests, The Predator will a reboot of the Predator franchise from director Shane Black (Iron Man 3, The Nice Guys). This week, however, it was revealed that Del Toro dropped out of the reboot&nbsp;due to “scheduling issues.” Instead, his lead role will now go to Boyd Holbrook, who is arguably much less of a household name. 20th Century Fox might, however, know something that we don’t, such as whether Boyd Holbrook might be more famous when The Predator is released on February 9, 2018. The possible reason for that speculation is that it was also revealed this week that Holbrook will be costarring in the next Wolverine movie, Logan, when it’s released on March 3, 2017. An Instagram this week revealed his character’s name to be Pierce, which most fans are interpreting to mean that he will be playing Donald Pierce, a long-running X-Men villain (and member of the Hellfire Club).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. JAMES CORDEN JOINS EMOJIMOVIE VOICE AS HIGH-FIVE EMOJIAs of this week, we are now ten months away from the August 11, 2017 release date for Sony Animation’s attempt at emulating the success of Warner Bros’ The LEGO Movie. That movie will be called Emojimovie: Express Yourself, and it will be an animated adventure into the world of “emojis,” featuring such characters as Smiley Face, High Five Emoji, and Poop Emoji. We’re not entirely sure all of those will be the actual character names, but the first poster this week pretty much confirmed that they look like that. We’ve known for a while that T.J. Miller (Deadpool, HBO’s Silicon Valley) will be voicing the main Emoji character (a “smiley face” named Gene), and this week, two more voice actors were announced. James Corden (of TV’s The Late Late Show with James Corden) will voice “Hi-5” (the “high five character, obviously), and Ilana Glazer (TV’s Broad City) will voice a female computer programmer Emoji named Jailbreak (who, as Gizmodo points out, looks a bit like Wyldstyle from The LEGO Movie). Emojimovie: Express Yourself will be directed by Anthony Leondis, whose previous films were Igor (Rotten at 36 percent) and the direct-to-video Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch (also Rotten at 40 percent).1.&nbsp;ICE CUBE AND KEVIN HART TO FINISH THE RIDE ALONG TRILOGYDecades of blockbuster-chasing on the part of Hollywood’s studios has steadily decreased the number of star-driven, relatively cheaply produced action-comedies that make it to our theaters each year. One that was a confirmed hit was 2014’s Ride Along ($134 million domestic), which was followed earlier this year by Ride Along 2 ($90.8 million domestic). Both movies starred Ice Cube as a police detective and Kevin Hart as his sister’s overly/easily excited boyfriend (who is a police academy cadet in the first movie). Both were considered hits because they were produced in the $25 million (Ride Along) to $40 million (Ride Along 2) range, even if the budget went up and the box office returns down for the second movie. However, Universal Pictures appears to remain committed to making more movies with Kevin Hart, because the studio has now begun development on Ride Along 3. To that end, Universal Pictures has hired the screenwriting team of Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi to start working on the script.&nbsp;In addition to working on the first two Ride Along movies, Hay and Manfredi also worked on such films as R.I.P.D., Aeon Flux, and the Clash of the Titans remake. Neither previous Ride Along movie was able to earn Tomatometer scores above 19 percent, which is why we’re calling Ride Along 3 the (most) Rotten Idea of the Week.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Fox, Esquire, Disney, 93rd, Valentine's, movies, E!, Christmas, doctor, justice, movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14143948/Fantastic-Beasts-Sequels-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-expands-to-five-films-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509191872923","title":"Jon Favreau Tapped to Direct Disney’s New Lion King, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jon Favreau Tapped to Direct Disney's New Lion King, and More Movie NewsNew roles for Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Viola Davis, Mindy Kaling, and Emma Thompson, plus Hot Wheels gets a director, and Fruit Ninja moves ahead.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 30, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Black Panther, Fruit Ninja, Hot Wheels, The Lion King, and Murder on the Orient Express.This WEEK’S TOP STORYIT’S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE: DISNEY TO REMAKE THE LION KINGEver since it became pretty obvious that Walt Disney Pictures was dedicated to remaking most of their back catalog (before say, 1996), there have been a few very obvious “big titles” that remained unannounced or unconfirmed. We’re at the point now where it’s far easier to list the films that Disney isn’t currently planning to remake&nbsp;than to list the ones it is. Some of the big ones still not announced yet include Lady and the Tramp, The Aristocats, The Rescuers, Pocahontas, and Bambi (though SNL has already spoofed that concept). The most popular such film (certainly in box office, as it’s the highest-grossing hand-drawn animated film of all time) is 1994’s The Lion King (not counting rumors). If one were to guess the reasons for Disney previously&nbsp;not developing a “live action” remake of The Lion King, the most obvious would&nbsp;be that the cast is comprised entirely of animals. Earlier this year, though, Disney’s remake of The Jungle Book seemed to lay that debate to rest, and it remains in the top 5 box office hits of the year to date. Jon Favreau (Iron Man) directed The Jungle Book for Disney, and now the studio has enlisted Favreau to direct their remake of The Lion King as well. Many sources are using the phrase “live-action,” but as this article points out, that’s highly unlikely.&nbsp;Instead, like&nbsp;The Jungle Book, The Lion King‘s animal characters will be CGI (albeit, very well animated). Jon Favreau and Walt Disney Pictures are also working on a sequel to The Jungle Book, but there is not yet a release date for that film, or The Lion King.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;JOHNNY DEPP AND DAISY RIDLEY TO WITNESS MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESSWe’ve known for over a year now that 20th Century Fox was preparing a remake of Murder on the Orient Express with director Kenneth Branagh (Thor, Cinderella) for release on November 22, 2017. For a long time, the biggest star in the film’s ensemble cast was expected to be Angelina Jolie, but last month, she was reported as having dropped out of the project. Jolie’s departure hasn’t apparently slowed down the Orient Express any, however, as this week, Fox announced a large ensemble cast for the remake, including one of Hollywood’s biggest (male) stars. Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley (Star Wars: The Force Awakens), Dame Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr. (Hamilton), Michael Pena (Ant-Man), and Michelle Pfeiffer are all among the stars who are now attached to costar in Murder on the Orient Express. They and several other actors are joining Kenneth Branagh, who, in addition to directing, is also starring in the film as Agatha Christie’s famous detective Hercule Poirot. It’s not yet known which characters these actors will be playing, or which actress is “replacing” Angelina Jolie, though it’s probably Michelle Pfeiffer (closest in age), or perhaps Daisy Ridley (not as close in age).&nbsp;Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted a few times before, but the most famous remains the 1974 version starring Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Connery, Sir John Gielgud, Anthony Perkins, and Vanessa Redgrave. Daisy Ridley also made the news this week for joining Sony’s new adaptation of Beatrix Potter’s children’s character Peter Rabbit (to be voiced by James Corden).2.&nbsp;HOW TO GET AWAY WITH A CAPER: VIOLA DAVIS TO STAR IN WIDOWSThis season now marks three years since the Academy Award-winning release of 12 Years a Slave, but the world is still awaiting a new film from director Steve McQueen. For a while, it was expected that McQueen’s follow-up would be a mini-series for HBO called Codes of Conduct, but that project was recently shelved. Instead, McQueen is now working on making his next feature film an adaptation of a 1983 British mini-series called Widows. Viola Davis is now attached to star in Widows, about a group of women who are brought together to complete a heist after their husbands all die in the first failed attempt to pull off the job. Steve McQueen is currently working on finishing the adaptation screenplay with Gillian Flynn, the author and screenwriter behind the 2014 hit film Gone Girl.3.&nbsp;FAST &amp; FURIOUS DIRECTOR TO PLAY WITH THE FAST CARS OF HOT WHEELSSome franchise concepts or licenses take decades to actually get produced as a big feature film. One such property this writer remembers covering over 15 years ago is a movie based on the Mattel toy car franchise Hot Wheels. (Basically, Hot Wheels took off as a development project soon after the release of the first The Fast and the Furious film in 2001.) As it turns out, maybe what Hot Wheels was waiting on was for the Fast and Furious franchise to become so popular that a director with three of those films under his belt would be available (after directing a Star Trek movie, even). Justin Lin, who directed the 4th, 5th, and 6th Fast and Furious films is now attached to direct Legendary Pictures’ adaptation of the popular Hot Wheels toy car franchise. Lin will also be producing, and the search is now on for a screenwriter to start work on developing Hot Wheels into a narrative film with, you know, an actual plot besides cars going really fast, and perhaps doing loop-de-loops (ala Speed Racer?).4. THIS WEEK IN MARVEL MOVIE NEWS: MAN-APE CAST IN BLACK PANTHER; STAN LEE AND SAM NEILL NEWSPretty much ever since the notion of a Black Panther movie was confirmed by Marvel Studios, an obvious choice for one of the film’s villains has been M’Baku, AKA Man-Ape, who is the leader of one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;rival tribes to King T’Challa’s Black Panther. It’s arguably for that reason that some fans were a little surprised when Michael B. Jordan was announced as playing the film’s main villain, and it was going to be Killmonger instead. Well, this week, all those Man-Ape fans got great news, because he will indeed be one of the film’s villains, alongside both Killmonger and Ulysses Klaw/Klaue (as already played by Andy Serkis in Avengers: Age of Ultron). M’Baku, AKA Man-Ape, will be played in Black Panther by Winston Duke from TV’s Person of Interest. Marvel Studios has scheduled Black Panther for release on February 16, 2018. As for the Marvel movies coming before Black Panther, it was revealed this week that “a couple of months ago,” Stan Lee flew down to Atlanta to film his cameo appearances in the next four Marvel Studios films, which are: Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Thor: Ragnarok (a few of which did indeed film in the Atlanta area). And finally, we also have a bit of news about Thor: Ragnarok, which is that Jurassic Park star Sam Neill revealed on Twitter this week that he has filmed a role in that film… but he can’t tell us more than that.5.&nbsp;MINDY KALING AND EMMA THOMPSON TO STAR IN LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW COMEDYAlthough Mindy Kaling remains committed to starring in The Mindy Project now that it’s on Hulu, the actress and comedian is continuing to branch out into doing more film work as well. Two of Kaling’s biggest recently announced film projects are the ensemble sequel/spin off Ocean’s Eight, and Disney’s adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time, in which she’ll play&nbsp;Mrs. Who.&nbsp;Kaling is also, however, developing her own films, starting with an untitled showbiz comedy which she is producing, writing, and starring in. The premise revolves around an aging late night talk show host (to be played by Emma Thompson), whose show gets new life when she hires the show’s first female writer, to be played by Mindy Kaling.6. MICHAEL SHANNON JOINS BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH’S EDISON MOVIE THE CURRENT WARThere have been various efforts in the last several years to somehow tell the story of inventors Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, specifically their conflict as both employer/employee and later as the brainiacs on either side of the technological dispute over what sort of electrical current would become used by most people worldwide (direct or alternating). Tesla’s alternating current patents were purchased by George Westinghouse, and with that, it became Westinghouse who took on Edison “directly.” Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange) has been attached for a while to star in The Current War as Thomas Edison, and this week, Michael Shannon began negotiations to join Cumberbatch, playing his competitor George Westinghouse.&nbsp;The role of Nikola Tesla has not been cast yet.7.&nbsp;JULIA ROBERTS TO STAR IN “PTA MOM” TRUE STORY FRAMEDOne of Julia Roberts’ most famous (and award-winning) films was 2000’s Erin Brockovich, the true story of a single mother trying to fight a big power company over alleged industrial poisoning.&nbsp; This week, Roberts signed on for another film based on a true story in California involving a real mother, but the subject’s resemblance to Erin Brockovich might end there. The film will be called Framed, and in it, Roberts will play a PTA president named Kelli Peters who became the victim of a coordinated “smear campaign,” which included marijuana and drugs being planted in her car.&nbsp;Framed will be an adaptation of a six-part series in The Los Angeles Times, which you can read in its entirety right here.2. SPEAKING OF PRETTY WOMAN, ROY ORBISON TO GET HIS OWN BIOPICAaron Rapoport / Getty ImagesThough it seems like ambitious musical biopics are a dime a dozen, there are still plenty of&nbsp;popular musicians whose life stories never made it to the big screen. One example&nbsp;is Roy Orbison, whose career began in the same sessions that gave us Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis (all three of which have already had their own biopics in the past). Orbison’s life was also marked with tragedy, as his wife died in a car crash and two of his sons died in a house fire. Now, the Roy Orbison estate has allowed his life story to be optioned for a potential feature film. The writers who are now working on the film called The Big O are Ray Gideon&nbsp;and Bruce Evans, whose past credits include Starman, Stand By Me, and Mr. Brooks.ROTTEN IDEA&nbsp;OF THE WEEK1.&nbsp;MOBILE GAME FRUIT NINJA TO BE ADAPTED AS A MOVIE ABOUT NINJAS CUTTING FRUITOver the last several years, one of the most lucrative new markets for “casual” video games has been in the mobile realm (phones, tablets, etc). It’s on those devices that games such as Angry Birds and Plants vs Zombies have had their greatest success. Earlier this year, the first major movie based on such a video game, The Angry Birds Movie,&nbsp;was released, and it’s&nbsp;currently the #18 movie in worldwide box office grosses. That movie also only earned a 42 percent Tomatometer score, which might serve as an example of the challenges in attempting certain types of video games which don’t inherently have strong narrative elements. Despite all that, New Line Cinema has won the film rights to another popular mobile game — Fruit Ninja&nbsp;— a big screen adaptation of which would presumably include ninjas who, well, cut fruit. As it turns out, that’s exactly what New Line has in mind.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"HBO, true, Stephen, lee","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/30180811/Lion-King-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"jon-favreau-tapped-to-direct-disneys-new-lion-king-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509193446822","title":"The Divergent Series Will End on TV, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Divergent Series Will End on TV, and More Movie NewsGhostbusters is getting a sequel, Chris Hemsworth rejoins Star Trek, TJ Miller voices an Emoji, and Hollywood loses another legend.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 21, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, the Weekly Ketchup is departing from our regular Friday schedule because of San Diego Comic-Con, and all of the extra big news that it will bring throughout the weekend.&nbsp; So today, you get&nbsp;a “pre-SDCC” Weekly Ketchup!&nbsp; This edition brings you nine headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Ghostbusters 2, Star Trek 4, a remake of Cooley High, and Edgar Wright’s Shadows.This Week’s Top StoryTHE DIVERGENT SERIES ASSIGNED TO A NEW FACTION: DIRECT-TO-TVWhen film historians tell the story of the first 15 or so years of the 21st century, at least one chapter is likely to be dedicated to the “YA” fad. The movie business is by nature cyclical, but this particular wave started and seemingly has ended all within the course of eight years. It was only in 2008 that the first Twilight movie was released (the last in 2012), and The Hunger Games spanned four movies, one a year from 2012 to 2015.&nbsp; Those two mega-successful franchises (both from Lionsgate or subsidiary Summit Entertainment) are the rare exceptions to a rule that was much more demonstrated by box office disappointments (The Host, Beautiful Creatures, I Am Number Four, The Giver, The Mortal Instruments, etc). Until this March, the Divergent&nbsp;series seemed like it would be another four-films-adapting-three-novels genre success for Lionsgate. The franchise starring Shailene Woodley kept dropping, both in box office and critical reception.&nbsp;Even so, it was presumed by most&nbsp;that Lionsgate would continue their sad march towards a Divergent series wrap up. The fourth movie, Divergent Series: Ascendant, even had a release date of June 9, 2017, up against both World War Z II&nbsp;and Universal’s next reboot of The Mummy, starring Tom Cruise. Well, according to Variety this week,&nbsp;Lionsgate is changing course at the last moment, negotiating for The Divergent Series: Ascendant&nbsp;to be made into a “TV movie” that would then lead to a Divergent spinoff TV series (probably using different characters). It sounds like there are still many unknown variables, such as which of the “movie stars” will also reprise their roles in the “TV movie.” Shailene Woodley, who got her start in TV (Secret Life of the American Teenager) might be likely to return, but Ansel Elgort and Theo James might not. As for what channel Divergent Series: Ascendant will be produced for, we still don’t know yet. However, Starz seems the most obvious candidate since that network was just acquired by Lionsgate three weeks ago for $4.4 billion (ie, Lionsgate might have known they were doing this at the time). So, what do the fans think?&nbsp; Is Divergent going direct-to-TV the final death knell in the “YA novel adaptation” fad?Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;DESPITE OPENING AT #2, THE GHOSTBUSTERS REBOOT WILL STILL GET A SEQUELWhen it comes to sequels, the math varies depending upon a few different factors, but the most obvious one is budget.&nbsp; The $46 million opening weekend of the Ghostbusters reboot, for example, would have been an obvious “franchise starter” for a movie on a $40 million budget.&nbsp; However, that movie was a special effects extravaganza, with a budget in the $144 million range. One of Sony Pictures’ executives confirmed soon after the box office numbers came out that, yes, they are still committed to making more Ghostbusters movies in the near future. Sony President of Worldwide Distribution Rory Brue specifically said, “I expect Ghostbusters to become an important brand and franchise… While nothing has been officially announced yet, there’s no doubt in my mind it will happen.” As for what the next Ghostbusters sequel might involve, the reboot has a scene after the credits that pretty much tells us. And we can almost certainly expect that the four female stars (Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Kristen Wiig) are probably already signed (or in negotiations) for the sequel as well (and probably director Paul Feig, too). One actor who might be tougher to confirm&nbsp;is Chris Hemsworth — along with his Marvel committments, it’s sounding like he will continue to be quite busy because…2.&nbsp;STAR TREK 4 (OR 14) CONFIRMED… INCLUDING CHRIS HEMSWORTH AS KIRK’S DAD?Earlier this year, it was confirmed that the “official” designation for the new timeline that started in the 2009 Star Trek reboot is “Kelvin.” That name comes from the ship that was destroyed by the time travelling baddies in the beginning of that film (if that’s a spoiler to you after seven years, well, you probably shouldn’t be reading any of this). One of the crewmen on the Kelvin was George Kirk, played by Chris Hemsworth, who of course was the father of the future Captain James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine). Kirk’s father dying so young was one of the more character-oriented changes in the Kelvin timeline (along with, you know, the entire planet Vulcan being destroyed), and this week’s news indicates we haven’t seen the last of him. Paramount Pictures, Skydance, and Bad Robot have announced the fourth/fourteenth Star Trek movie, and one of the stars will be… Chris Hemsworth as Kirk’s dad. The announcement doesn’t explain exactly how that happens, but calls him “a man he [James T. Kirk] never had a chance to meet, but whose legacy has haunted him since the day he was born.” Time travel probably is the most obvious explanation for how this will all go down (whole books could be written about time travel in Star Trek), but there are other possibilities. One other detail was revealed about Star Trek 4 this week, namely&nbsp;a confirmation from J.J. Abrams that Pavel Chekov, played by the recently late Anton Yelchin, will not be recast, saying, “There’s no recasting. I can’t possibly imagine that, and I think Anton deserves better.”&nbsp; There’s no release date for the 4th/14th Star Trek movie yet, but given the 3-4 years between the films recently, we can guess at a target window of either 2019 or 2020.3.&nbsp;BROOKLYN DIRECTOR TO ADAPT PULITZER PRIZE WINNING NOVEL THE GOLDFINCHThis week, we’re giving you two editions of The Weekly Ketchup, because of the anticipated deluge of news coming out of San Diego Comic-Con. If there’s going to be one story that sort of exemplifies the difference between this first column, and the second, it’s this one (in a few ways). In 2014, after taking 11 years off, author Donna Tartt came back with her third novel, The Goldfinch, and was rewarded with the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.&nbsp;The Goldfinch is a sprawling, decades-long American epic with elements including terrorism, art theft, and alcholism (basically, it’s a lot like Great Expectations) — in other words, it’s a little&nbsp;different from the comic book movies we’ll hear about this week. Warner Bros has had the film rights to The Goldfinch since 2014, and this week, we learned that the studio&nbsp;is now in talks with director John Crowley for him to make The Goldfinch his next film after last year’s award-winning drama Brooklyn. If he signs on, Crowley will be working from a screenplay adaptation by screenwriter Peter Straughan (cowriter of Frank, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy).4. DREAMWORKS’ BIG PLANS FOR 2019: SHREK 5 AND EDGAR WRIGHT’S SHADOWSThe traditional “trades” are still out there covering the film business, but every once in a while they do something&nbsp;that reminds us they’re still not fully caught up with the&nbsp;era of “social media.” For example, Variety and The Hollywood Reporter still sometimes “bury the lede,” nestling the most interesting tidbits in much longer, seemingly less&nbsp;important articles or profiles. One example happened this week when The Hollywood Reporter ran a story about Jeffrey Katzenberg’s future, following the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation by Universal earlier this year. Sort of halfway through, you’ll find one sentence about the year 2019, during which DreamWorks Animation will release Shrek 5 and the movie now known as Shadows. We’ve covered both of those movies in the Weekly Ketchup in recent weeks and months, but the news that they are now “only” three years away is still big. There’s not much to say about Shrek 5 (except maybe that it now sounds more like a sequel, and less like a reboot, as once suggested). The movie called Shadows definitely does require a bit more explanation, though. The film, first announced last November, will mark the animation debut of fan-favorite director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz). DreamWorks has long been wanting to do an animated movie involving the concept of “shadows,” dating back to their ambitious Me and My Shadow from several years ago, and Edgar Wright’s Shadows is an extension of that.5. DAKOTA FANNING TO STAR IN SYLVIA PLATH’S THE BELL JAR FOR DIRECTOR KIRSTEN DUNSTKirsten Dunst is now preparing to make her feature film debut as director after directing two short films in 2007 and 2010, and she’s sort of swinging for the fences with an independent remake of Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar, previously adapted as a film in 1979 starring Marilyn Hassett and Jameson Parker. Originally published under a pseudonym,&nbsp;The Bell Jar was the only novel written by poet Sylvia Plath– she&nbsp;committed suicide a few months after The Bell Jar was published in 1963 — and is now interpreted as a roman à clef (a work of fiction based mostly on real events), as both the main character and Plath herself struggled with similar psychological issues. Dakota Fanning (who will turn 23 next year) will star as the novel’s central character, Esther Greenwood, a young woman whose potential future as a promising writer is rocked by her own struggles with mental health. Independent production of Dunst’s adaptation is expected to start in early 2017, possibly aiming for a debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January, 2018.6.&nbsp;RAPPER/ACTOR COMMON TO PRODUCE AND STAR IN A REMAKE OF COOLEY HIGHFew decades were as&nbsp;rife with nostalgia as the 1970s (mostly for the 1950s and early 1960s). Full discussion of the “why” would require much, much more discussion, but it was probably partially&nbsp;due to&nbsp;how quickly American life had changed in 10 or so years from, say, 1962 to 1972. A few examples of this nostalgia in the 1970s were Happy Days, Laverne &amp; Shirley, and at the movies, American Graffiti and Animal House. Another such film (which is arguably not as popular today as its competition) was 1975’s Cooley High, about a group of African American best friends living in Chicago in 1964. Produced for under a million dollars, Cooley High was both a box office success ($13 million) and a hit with critics (82 percent on the Tomatometer). MGM&nbsp; is the studio most known for remakes than any other these days (such as Poltergeist, Hercules, RoboCop, and the upcoming Ben-Hur, The Magnificent Seven, and Going in Style), and now, it’s also&nbsp;planning a remake of Cooley High,&nbsp;working with rapper-turned-actor Common, who will produce the remake as well as costar (probably as one of the teachers). It’s also possible Common might contribute at least one song to the score. As for why Cooley High, and why now? Reportedly, the producers felt that a new Cooley High would be “a timely project in light of the racial unrest that has followed several high-profile shootings throughout the country.”Rotten Ideas of The Week2. SILICON VALLEY/DEADPOOL&nbsp;STAR T.J. MILLER TO VOICE LEAD IN EMOJIMOVIE: EXPRESS YOURSELFAlthough it was great that The LEGO Movie was over-the-top fun and creative in its adaptation of the titular toys, the bad news was that its success unsurprisingly inspired lots of other studios and producers to try to mine gold from traditionally non-narrative properties. One example is the “Emoji,” i.e. the little smiley faces and icons you can attach to texts and Facebook posts. To that end, Sony Pictures put an animated movie called EmojiMovie: Express Yourself into fast production, aiming for a release date next summer on August 11, 2017. And now, we know who will be providing that movie the voice for its lead character. T.J. Miller, who is probably best known for either costarring in Deadpool, or in HBO’s Silicon Valley, will provide the voice of a “meh” Emoji named Gene who finds himself conveying other emotions (because of a software glitch).&nbsp;EmojiMovie: Express Yourself will be directed by Anthony Leondis, whose previous films included Igor (Rotten at 36 percent) and the direct-to-video sequel Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch (also Rotten at 40 percent).1. R.I.P. GARRY MARSHALL (1934-2016)Obviously, beloved celebrities and filmmakers die every year, but 2016 seems particularly rough so far. We lost another of Hollywood’s most popular filmmakers this week, with the news that Garry Marshall died at the age of 81 from complications from pneumonia following a recent stroke. Marshall was a triple threat, working as a film director/writer, one of the most successful TV producer/showrunners ever, and also as a frequent comedian and actor. This included the rare feat of becoming something of a center of a “Marshallverse,” an ever expanding circle of stars and creators who all had deep ties early in their careers to Marshall. We can arguably thank him&nbsp;for the careers of director Ron Howard (from Happy Days), Robin Williams (from Mork &amp; Mindy), Penny Marshall (his sister, but also his Laverne &amp; Shirley star), and even Julia Roberts (who had her first major hit movie with Pretty Woman). Critically, Marshall’s last 25 years have been a little rough, but many of his Rotten movies were, admittedly, “barely” Rotten, right in the 50-59 percent range. The “Garry Marshall problem” might simply have been that he made the sort of broad appeal, warm-and-fuzzy comedies that audiences tended to embrace more than critics did. In recent years, Marshall had turned most of his energy towards his own mini-genre of holiday comedies: Valentine’s Day, New Year’s Eve, and Mother’s Day.&nbsp; Sure, none of them earned above 18 percent on the Tomatometer, but we’re still going to miss reporting on what holiday he might have adapted next.&nbsp; R.I.P.

Back then, it was Spider-Man, a dream which was ultimately realized when Glover was cast as the voice of Miles Morales in Ultimate Spider-Man, and he’s also going to be in next year’s Spider-Man: Homecoming (in an as-yet-unknown role). As it turns out, however, what might end up being the iconic role that could make Glover a true household name (ala Chris Pratt’s transition from Parks &amp; Recreation) has nothing&nbsp;to do with Spider-Man at all. Instead, Glover’s biggest casting coup to date is as the young Lando Calrissian in the Han Solo prequel, reprising the role originated by Billy Dee Williams in The Empire Strikes Back. Whatever it ends up being called (Han Solo: A Star Wars Story, perhaps?), this prequel will be directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the team who have already given us The LEGO Movie and the two 21 Jump Street movies. Alden Ehrenreich (Hail, Caesar!) will play the young Han Solo, and three of the actresses who have tested for the female lead are: Zoe Kravitz, Naomi Scott, and Tessa Thompson. Walt Disney Pictures has scheduled the untitled Han Solo movie for release on May 25, 2018, the week after How to Train Your Dragon 3 (5/18/18), and two weeks before Ocean’s Eight and the Transformers spinoff about Bumblebee (6/8/18). As for what Donald Glover’s mom, a longtime Billy Dee Williams fan, told him to do with the role, “Don’t mess it up!”Fresh Developments1. THIS WEEK IN DIRECTOR NEWS FOR DEADPOOL 2 (TARANTINO, NO; JOHN WICK CODIRECTOR, MAYBE)Some weeks, the same movie might make the news two times, and in rare cases, maybe even three times. This week, Deadpool 2 made the news four separate times, and it was all for the same reason: the director. Tim Miller made his feature film debut with Deadpool earlier this year, but on Saturday, the news broke that Deadpool 2 would not be his second film, with “creative differences” cited in the initial report. Within a few days, however, The Wrap broke the news that the real difference between what Tim Miller wanted, and what star Ryan Reynolds and the screenwriters (the Zombieland guys) wanted, had to do with budget and vision. Tim Miller’s idea reportedly was for a more “stylish” look for the sequel, which would have required a budget three times the first film’s, and Reynolds preferred staying with a “scrappy, raunchy, and inexpensive” take. Reynolds and the screenwriters apparently won that one. Around the same time, a fan petition started online to recruit Quentin Tarantino’s talents as the director of the Deadpool sequel (which would have been groundbreaking for several reasons, such as requiring Tarantino to break away from the Weinsteins and his own original screenplays). That petition has already attracted nearly 10,000 signers, but not even a week after all of this started, it appears to already be a moot point. That’s because John Wick codirector David Leitch has now emerged as the frontrunner for the Deadpool sequel directing gig. David Leitch had already been a frontrunner to direct the X-Force movie (which might spin out of Deadpool 2), so this is something of an extension of those plans. The sequel, which might be called Deadpool &amp; Cable, is expected to be released sometime in 2018, with filming to start sometime in 2017.2. ICE CUBE TO STAR IN DISNEY’S LIVE-ACTION OLIVER TWIST MUSICALLong before he became a movie star and comedian (Friday, 21 Jump Street, Ride Along), Ice Cube was also a musician, both as a solo artist and a member of N.W.A., the group whose story was told in last year’s Straight Outta Compton. However, Ice Cube’s film career has never really included a “musical” (at least not one with him&nbsp;in a lead role). That looks likely to change soon, because Ice Cube is now attached to star in Disney’s new live-action musical remake of Charles Dickens’&nbsp;Oliver Twist. The 47-year-old Cube will play the “elderly” character of Fagin, who leads a gang of pickpockets in modern-day America (updated from 19th century London). This new Oliver Twist musical will mark the feature film debut of director Thomas Kail, whose credits include Broadway’s Hannibal&nbsp;and the Grease Live! TV movie. This new Oliver Twist musical is not expected to have any connection to Disney’s 1988 animated feature Oliver and Company (which adapted Dickens with dogs and cats). However, if one wanted to scratch Oliver and Company off the list of possible animated Disney films that could become live-action remakes, this might be the closest thing to that ever happening.3.&nbsp;JENNIFER LAWRENCE AND SCARLETT JOHANSSON ATTACHED TO DUELING ZELDA BIOPICSDue to its collectively competitive nature (and the time it takes for movies to usually get produced), we may never seen the end of the concept of “dueling movies,” in which two or more similar projects attempt to race each other to be the first released. We can now add to the list&nbsp;the true story of the tragic, flawed life of Gilded Age icon Zelda Fitzgerald (ie, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s wife). That’s because two of Hollywood’s most popular current young actresses are both attached to star in their own takes on Zelda Fitzgerald. The project that made more news this week, called Zelda, has Jennifer Lawrence attached, with Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13) producing with an eye towards possibly also directing. The other project (which has actually been reported on for a while now) is called The Beautiful and Damned, and Scarlett Johansson is attached to star in that version.4. THE INCREDIBLES 2 TO ARRIVE A YEAR EARLIER (AND TOY STORY 4 A YEAR LATER)Depending upon your own perspective, this particular story might either great news, bad news, or more likely, a little bit of both. We’re siding on the “good news” side, however, because the world has already had two Toy Story sequels, and not one for The Incredibles yet. You may have heard in recent months that Disney and Pixar had scheduled The Incredibles 2 for release in 2019, but that changed this week.&nbsp;The Incredibles 2 is now scheduled for release a year earlier, on June 15, 2018, and Toy Story 4 has been bumped back a year to June 21, 2019. In both cases, these Pixar sequels will be within one week of a Transformers movie (the Bumblebee spinoff is on 6/8/18, and Transformers 6 is set for June 28, 2019). The next Pixar sequel in theaters will be Cars 3, which is scheduled for June 16, 2017 (up against the spy sequel Kingsman: The Golden Circle&nbsp;and Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow’s The Book of Henry).5.&nbsp;PETER JACKSON WRITING/PRODUCING SCI-FI EPIC MORTAL ENGINESIt has now been almost two years since the release of the last of Peter Jackson’s three films adapting J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit, and we’re still no closer to knowing what his next film as director might be. Past possible projects that may indeed end up being his next film as director include the WWII remake The Dam Busters, the dragon fantasy Temeraire, and the Adventures of Tintin sequel. There is, however, another project that previously was thought to be a potential Peter Jackson directorial effort, which this week was confirmed to be merely produced and cowritten by Jackson (along with Fran Walsh). That film is an adaptation of the 2002 award-winning science-fiction novel Mortal Engines, about a distant post-apocalyptic future about a technologically advanced version of London that travels the Earth, salvaging other ruined cities for parts to keep the now mobile city running.&nbsp;Mortal Engines is now set up at Universal Pictures, where it will mark the directorial debut of Christian Rivers, who worked as a second director on such films as this year’s remake of Pete’s Dragon&nbsp;and Peter Jackson’s own Hobbit films.6.&nbsp;KEVIN HART TO PLAY SANTA CLAUS IN DASHING THROUGH THE SNOWAlong with Sherlock Holmes and Dracula, Santa Claus ranks near the top of the list of fictional characters who have appeared (this article claims he’s #2 between Jesus and the Devil). That being said, the rate at which Santa Claus appears in feature films seems to have slowed in the last several years, though he was indeed in Elf, the three Santa Clause movies, Arthur Christmas, and recently, the 2012 would-be franchise starter Rise of the Guardians. Well, Walt Disney Pictures appears to want to correct that oversight, because the studio is now developing a Santa Claus movie&nbsp;called Dashing Through the Snow. Kevin Hart is in talks to play Santa Claus in this story about a police detective who seeks the help of Santa to help his son believe in the magic of Christmas. It’s not yet known if frequent Kevin Hart costars Ice Cube (Ride Along) or Dwayne Johnson (Central Intelligence, next year’s Jumanji) might be cast as the detective. It’s also unclear if Kevin Hart might sport a “fat suit” to bulk up to the Jolly Old Elf’s traditional girth.7. GOD PARTICLE CONFIRMED TO BE THE THIRD CLOVERFIELD MOVIEA few years ago now (2012), we first heard about a movie called The Cellar, which went on to attract the acting talents of John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Of course we&nbsp;now know that movie was 10 Cloverfield Lane, after some elements of the screenplay were adapted to fit in with something best described as a “Cloverfield theme.” Likewise, we’ve known for a while now about a J.J. Abrams-produced science fiction movie called God Particle, scheduled for release on February 24, 2017. When it was first announced, that movie was reportedly was about the crew of a space station who witness the disappearance of the planet Earth following an experiment (possibly involving something like the Large Hadron Collider). What we think we know about this movie might now be totally out the window, though. We say that because the movie formerly known as God Particle has now been confirmed to the third Cloverfield movie. That might also mean a new title, but that hasn’t been confirmed yet. Whatever it ends up being called, this movie will feature more of an ensemble cast, including such actors and actresses as Daniel Bruhl (Captain America: Civil War), Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Beyond the Lights), Chris O’Dowd (Bridesmaids), David Oyelowo (Selma), and Zhang Ziyi (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon).8.&nbsp;ED HELMS AND TRACY MORGAN TO PLAY DECADES-LONG GAME OF TAGFollowing the 2014 collision with a Wal-Mart semi truck that had many people worried that he may never return as an entertainer, 30 Rock and SNL alum Tracy Morgan is indeed well on his way back. His first major feature film role (made after the accident) will be in February’s Food Fight (in a supporting role; Ice Cube and Charlie Day are the leads). As for Morgan’s post-accident return as a comedy leading man, we can now report that it will be a movie called TAG, with Ed Helms (The Hangover, Vacation) cast as the other lead. TAG is adapted from the true story of ten friends from a prep school in Spokane, WA, who went on to spend the next 23 years (30 years in the movie) playing an ongoing game of tag, which is spread across both the years and the nation. TAG will mark the theatrically-released feature film debut of Jeff Tomsic, who has previously worked mostly in television. One of the real people that this movie is based upon is named Brian Dennehy, but acclaimed actor Brian Dennehy (Cocoon, F/X, Tommy Boy) has not (yet) been cast in this movie.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1.&nbsp;GERARD BUTLER’S FALLEN FRANCHISE TO CONTINUE WITH ANGEL HAS FALLENAlthough neither film earned a Fresh Tomatometer score, both Olympus Has Fallen and its 2016 sequel London Has Fallen apparently earned enough global box office (relative to their budgets) for the franchise’s producers to consider them a success. The true test in such film development is in whether the studio or producers start development on another sequel, and that’s exactly what happened this week. Millennium Films has signed Gerard Butler to reprise his Secret Service agent character in a third film&nbsp;to be called Angel Has Fallen, which returns to the original film’s “code name” title, with “Angel” being the film’s code name for Air Force One (Olympus was the White House in the first movie). In this third film, Butler’s character will himself be the target of the bad guys, although, “If his attackers can take down half of Washington, D.C. with it, all the better.” Filming is expected to start in mid-2017, with the release target likely being sometime in 2018 or 2019. This is the Rotten Idea of the Week based on the 48 percent and 26 percent Rotten scores of the first two films.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Mary, scorecard, Critics, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/28163550/Donald-Glover-Lando-Calrissian.jpg","slug":"donald-glover-will-be-han-solos-young-lando-calrissian-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509191901600","title":"DC’s Live Action Dark Universe Is Happening, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})DC's Live Action Dark Universe Is Happening, and More Movie NewsSam Mendes does Disney, Sarah Paulson joins Ocean's Eight, Mission: Impossible 6 is held up, and Angry Birds gets a sequel.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 26, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as The Angry Birds Movie 2, James and the Giant Peach, Mission: Impossible 6, The New Mutants, and Ocean’s Eight.This WEEK’S TOP STORYCONSTANTINE, SWAMP THING, AND THEIR SUPER FRIENDS TO UNITE IN DARK UNIVERSEEarlier this month, Warner Bros and DC Comics debuted their Suicide Squad movie to smashing box office success ($275 million domestic, $583 million worldwide, and counting), even if the critical reaction was not as positive. The&nbsp;movie was presented as something of a Justice League for super villains (though really only Harley Quinn and The Joker were “A-listers”), and the film’s success is apparently inspiring Warner Bros to revisit one of their similar projects.&nbsp;Justice League Dark concerns a “non-team” of loosely connected supernatural characters who band together to defeat the magic threats that the Justice League itself cannot handle as well.&nbsp; Members of Justice League Dark in the comics included John Constantine, Swamp Thing, Deadman, Zatanna, and Etrigan the Demon.&nbsp; Director Guillermo Del Toro was at one time developing a movie based on the 48-issue run of Justice League Dark, but when he departed the project, DC announced at SDCC last month that Justice League Dark would become a direct-to-video animated feature instead.&nbsp; (We should note that it’s possible the animated feature and the subject of this week’s news may end up being two different things.) Fans who were concerned about the future of a live action movie featuring Swamp Thing and John Constantine may no longer have as much reason to fret, as Warner Bros (following the success of Suicide Squad) now seems quite committed to the film again. And the good news for the film, now called Dark Universe, may not be great news for Fox and Marvel’s Gambit, either, because director Doug Liman (Edge of Tomorrow, The Bourne Identity) has departed Gambit, and is now in talks to direct Dark Universe instead. Neither Keanu Reeves nor TV’s Matt Ryan are expected to reprise their versions of John Constantine in the Dark Universe movie. Doug Liman’s next movie to reach theaters will be his drug cartel drama American Made, starring Tom Cruise, which is scheduled for release in September, 2017.Fresh Developments1. JAMES BOND DIRECTOR MAY ADAPT DISNEY’S (LIVE ACTION) JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACHEven though their two latest efforts (Alice Through the Looking Glass and Pete’s Dragon) have not set the box office afire the way their other live action films (like The Jungle Book) have, Walt Disney Pictures remains dedicated to what they’re doing with their back catalog. The last two years have seen announcements made about live action films for over a dozen of Disney’s past hits, including Cruella (of 101 Dalmatians), Dumbo, Genies (from Aladdin), The Little Mermaid, Mulan, Night on Bald Mountain (and The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, both from Fantasia), Peter Pan, Pinocchio, The Sword in the Stone, and Winnie the Pooh. And that’s just their animated movies, with Pete’s Dragon and Mary Poppins Returns&nbsp;both being examples Disney revisiting their live action past (though both those also had some animation as well). This expansive slate grew by another title this week, with the news that Disney is now also developing a live action adaptation of 1996’s James and the Giant Peach, their stop-motion adaptation of the book by Roald Dahl. (Disney’s most recent adaptation of a Roald Dahl book was this summer’s box office disappointment The BFG.) The most surprising news about Disney’s plans for a new James and the Giant Peach, however, is the revelation that the director they hope to recruit is British director Sam Mendes. In addition to American Beauty (and the 2013 stage version of Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), Sam Mendes’ two most recent feature films were the James Bond adventures Skyfall and Spectre. British author Nick Hornby (whose film credits&nbsp;include Brooklyn, About a Boy, and High Fidelity) is also in talks to adapt Roald Dahl’s book. Mendes also holds&nbsp;the impressive distinction of not yet scoring&nbsp;a Rotten for any of the seven feature films he’s directed to date&nbsp;(and three of those were Certified Fresh to boot) — which is why we’re calling Sam Mendes (possibly) directing James and the Giant Peach&nbsp;this week’s #1 Fresh Development.2.&nbsp;DENZEL WASHINGTON MAY STAR IN INNER CITY LEGAL DRAMADwayne Johnson may have made the news this week as the top paid male movie star, but one actor&nbsp;who remains consistently dependable as a&nbsp;box office draw is Denzel Washington. As such, when a movie belonging to a genre not typically associated “box office gold” these days, like a legal drama, can attract the attention of someone like Denzel Washington, you have to figure the movie’s producers are probably&nbsp;pleased with their accomplishment. Washington is in talks to star in a legal drama called Inner City&nbsp;to be directed by Nightcrawler director Dan Gilroy. Before Nightcrawler, Gilroy was best known as a screenwriter&nbsp;whose&nbsp;credits include&nbsp;Two for the Money, The Bourne Legacy, and next year’s Kong: Skull Island. Details about Inner City aren’t yet known, except that Washington will play a lawyer dealing with “a major change at his company,” that it’s compared to Paul Newman’s The Verdict, and that it’s set in Los Angeles.3. THIS WEEK IN MARVEL: GOTG CONFIRMED FOR AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR; AND CAPTAIN MARVEL DIRECTOR NEWSThere were two newsworthy items for WB/DC’s Marvel-ous competition this week that we can bundle together. The first concerns Avengers: Infinity War (5/4/18), an ambitious ensemble film about which a few presumptions have been made by the online fanbase at large. One such notion has been that the Guardians of the Galaxy would be coming to Earth to help deal with the threat posed by Thanos in his search for the Infinity Gems (one of which is inset in the Vision’s forehead). Though that was probably always a pretty good guess, we’ve never had that particular detail confirmed by anyone in a position to do so… until this week.&nbsp;Without giving any other details, Vin Diesel (the voice of Groot) did exactly that during a Facebook live video feed. Groot, Rocket (Raccoon), Star-Lord, Drax, and Gamora will next appear in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, scheduled for release on May 5, 2017. The other Marvel movie to make significant news this week was Captain Marvel (3/8/19), which we’ve known for a while will star Brie Larson in the title role. What we don’t know yet is which female director will be at the helm, but this week, the potential pool of dozens of directors has been narrowed to three (and possibly one mystery director). The short list reportedly includes Niki Caro (Whale Rider, North Country), Lorene Scafaria (Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) and frequent TV director Lesli Linka Glatter (whose impressive credits include 4 episodes of Twin Peaks and 14 episodes of Homeland). As for the possibility of a fourth director in the mix, a tease came from Variety writer Justin Kroll, who replied to THR’s tweet with, “You’re missing one.” Filming of Captain Marvel is not expected to start until mid-2017, so there is still plenty of time for Marvel Studios to hire its director, following a round of presentations after the final three (or four) have had time to see the film’s script treatment and other related background materials.4.&nbsp;THE NEW MUTANTS GETS EVEN MORE “TEEN MOVIE” CREDENTIALSWe’ve known for a while now that one of Fox’s major X-Men-related movies (after next year’s Wolverine 3) was going to be The New Mutants, about the team that debuted in the 1980s. We’ve also&nbsp;known that the director developing The New Mutants at Fox is Josh Boone, best known for his work on Fox’s The Fault in Our Stars (starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort). More so&nbsp;than most X-Men comics, The New Mutants was always firmly a “teenage” comic story, and this week’s news confirms that someone at Fox “gets” that. Josh Boone has now been joined by screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, who previously worked with Boone on The Fault in Our Stars, as well as&nbsp;The Spectacular Now. The same story confirmed the six previously mentioned New Mutants team members (sorry, Karma and Magma fans; maybe next time?). (It’s unclear at this point whether or not Warlock’s mutant collaborator Cypher will be part of the story, since well… spoilers.) Fox has not yet announced a release date for The New Mutants, but at this point, it’s still possible it could be released in the summer of 2018.5.&nbsp;SARAH PAULSON&nbsp;ROUNDS OUT THE OCEAN’S EIGHT CASTOver the last few months, we’ve been hearing regular casting news for the fourth movie in the Ocean’s Eleven franchise, as more actresses join (or don’t join) the movie called Ocean’s Eight. As of the most recent news, the tally of actresses confirmed to be in talks for roles in Ocean’s Eight stood at seven, implying there was just one major role yet to be cast and/or announced. To bring you up to date, those seven actresses are (in alphabetical order): rapper-turned-actress Awkwafina, Cate Blanchett, Sandra Bullock, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, and singer-turned-actress Rihanna. Actress number eight, now in talks, is Sarah Paulson, who is best known for her work on such TV shows as American Horror Story and&nbsp;The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story. Ocean’s Eight will be directed by Gary Ross (Seabiscuit, The Hunger Games, Pleasantville). Plot details aren’t known yet, except that it involves a “major heist,” and there are rumors that Sandra Bullock’s character may be a cousin (or other relative) of George Clooney’s Danny Ocean character.ROTTEN IDEAS&nbsp;OF THE WEEK4. THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE&nbsp;IS GETTING A SEQUELAs reported repeatedly the last few weeks, the summer of 2016 yielded&nbsp;a number of box office disappointments. One movie sort of in the middle was The Angry Birds Movie, which just barely made back its production budget ($73 million, out of a domestic gross of $107 million), helped along by its global box office of over $346 million.&nbsp; The movie, based upon a popular mobile video game franchise, fared worse in terms of critical reception, earning a Rotten score of just 43 percent (though the film did receive an A+ Cinemascore). Even so, it’s apparently the global box office that really mattered for Rovio Entertainment, because the makers of Angry Birds are moving forward with plans for a sequel. No other details are yet known, including whether any (or all) of the film’s voice cast will be returning.3. AVENGERS COSTAR JEREMY RENNER JOINS ANIMATED SUPERHERO MOVIE ARCTIC JUSTICE: THUNDER SQUADAs far as we know, Jeremy Renner will continue appearing&nbsp;in future Marvel movies (such as 2018’s Avengers: Infinity War) as Hawkeye, but this week, the actor signed on to star in another superhero movie. Renner has signed to provide the voice of the lead animal superhero, a fox named Swifty,&nbsp;in the 3D animated family adventure Arctic Justice: Thunder Squad. He joins&nbsp;a voice cast that also includes Alec Baldwin, James Franco, Anjelica Huston, Omar Sy, and John Cleese, who is voicing the film’s main villain, Doc Walrus. The directors and animators of Arctic Justice: Thunder Squad will be working from a script by screenwriters Cal Brunker and Bob Barlen (Escape from Planet Earth, which has a Rotten Tomatometer of just 33 percent). The production company behind Arctic Justice: Thunder Squad is AMBI Group, which is a new-ish company best known right now for their desire&nbsp;to remake Christopher Nolan’s modern classic Memento.2. BAD BOYS, BAD BOYS, WHATCHA GONNA DO? WHATCHA GONNA DO WHEN THEY MAKE A COPS MOVIE ABOUT YOU?The back-and-forth adaptations between TV shows and movies are not quite what they were back during the trend’s 1990s heyday, but it’s still a pretty big thing in at least one genre: cop movies. On TV, there have been recent series (or pilots) based on such movies as Beverly Hills Cop, Rush Hour, and Lethal Weapon, and at the movies, 21 Jump Street and its sequel 22 Jump Street have been recent box office hits (with Baywatch, which is sort of&nbsp;about beach cops, on the way next summer). This week brought development news about a film adaptation based&nbsp;not on a fictional TV series, but a show which was actually a documentary series (before&nbsp;they&nbsp;were called “reality TV”). That show is COPS, which recently marked the premiere of its 26th (!) season.&nbsp; Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad, 30 Minutes or Less) is now attached to develop COPS into an action comedy movie, reportedly in the style of Lethal Weapon. It’s unknown right now whether the movie will incorporate the film crews that accompany the real life police officers on the TV show (but if it didn’t, it wouldn’t really be much like COPS, would it?).1.&nbsp;PRE-PRODUCTION OF MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 6 HALTEDSpeaking of movies based on TV shows, one franchise that has done pretty well with critics (not counting the 57 percent Rotten score for Mission: Impossible 2) is, well, Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible franchise with Paramount Pictures. Ostensibly, the movies have also been box office successes, so one might expect Paramount to continue green lighting Mission: Impossible movies as an ongoing venture (especially since Paramount doesn’t really have that many successful franchises). That’s exactly what is not happening, now, with the news this week that Paramount Pictures has halted pre-production on Mission: Impossible 6. There appear to be two reasons at hand, and they both involve money. One explanation is that Paramount wants the franchise producers (including Tom Cruise and Bad Robot Productions) to “trim their fees” (allowing for more direct profit for Paramount). The other possible reason has Tom Cruise asking for a pay raise from his previous Mission: Impossible paydays, following a large amount that competitor Universal Pictures extended to Tom Cruise for starring in their new reboot of The Mummy (as part of their attempt at a “Universal Monsters Cinematic Universe”). Obviously, these two explanations can’t both be resolved equally, unless Tom Cruise concedes a cut in his producer fee and gets a pay raise as an actor (another possibility could be just lowering the overall production budget). Many pundits seem think this will be resolved, but since the Mission: Impossible movies have been 4-out-of-5 critical hits, we can’t help but see any delay in getting the 6th movie produced and in front our movie-loving eyes as sort of a Rotten Idea.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"zero, Star, History, The, DGA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/26130605/Justice-League-Dark-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"dcs-live-action-dark-universe-is-happening-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509193450920","title":"Pixar Has No Sequels Scheduled After The Incredibles II in 2019, Plus More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Pixar Has No Sequels Scheduled After The Incredibles II in 2019, Plus More Movie NewsAnna Kendrick wants to be a superhero, Idris Elba wants to be a director, and Keifer Sutherland wants to revisit Flatliners.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 8, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Chappaquiddick, Flatliners, The Flash, and… are we reading this right, Marvel’s Squirrel Girl?This Week’s Top StoryNO MORE PIXAR SEQUELS PLANNED AFTER THE INCREDIBLES II IN 2019In the beginning, two of Pixar’s feature films started with the words Toy Story. After Toy Story 2 in 1999, however, Pixar’s next seven films were all original concepts, until Toy Story 3 was released in 2010. Since then,&nbsp;sequels have made up 50 percent of Pixar’s output (Cars 2, Monsters University, Finding Dory&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;Brave, Inside Out, The Good Dinosaur). And until this week, the trend certainly appeared to be that the studio would be revisiting their popular films frequently, with only one original film —&nbsp;Coco&nbsp;(11/22/17), about the Mexican “Dia de los Muertos” holiday — among their next four films. The remaining three films scheduled are sequel:&nbsp;next summer’s Cars 3 (6/6/17), Toy Story 4 (6/15/18), and The Incredibles II (6/21/19). This week, Pixar President Jim Morris revealed to Entertainment Weekly that on the animation studio’s schedule, there are no sequels currently planned past The Incredibles II in 2019. Morris also revealed that&nbsp;the studio has two movies scheduled for 2020, and two other movies past that, and none of the four will be sequels. If the year 2021 is another year with two Pixar releases, that means we could get a sequel in either 2022 or 2023, but it’s just as possible that Pixar could continue committing to original ideas. So, if you’re hungry for further big screen adventures for WALL-E, Merida (Brave), Remy (Ratatouille), Riley (Inside Out), or Carl and Russell (UP), you have at least a six year wait in front of you (and more likely, much longer). What concepts do you think Pixar should consider adapting next?Fresh Developments This Week1. WOULD ANNA KENDRICK WORK FOR ACORNS TO BE MARVEL’S SQUIRREL GIRL?There have been many, many more Marvel Comics characters adapted for the big screen than DC Comics, partly because Fox and Sony have taken on some of that burden, but also because there now 11 released MCU movies (with 9 more planned before 2020). Even so, Marvel’s roster of superheroes remains far more vast. Without even counting the various spinoff teams (of which there are at least 12), there are over 125 “main” Avengers members, of which only a little more than a dozen have been represented in the MCU. In other words, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is only just beginning, and there is a plethora of characters waiting in the comic books for their chances at feature film glory. One example&nbsp;is Squirrel Girl, who this year is celebrating her 25th anniversary after first appearing in an Iron Man story in 1991. Aided by her squirrel sidekick Tippy Toe, Squirrel Girl uses her rodent-endowed abilities to be one of the most powerful superheroes Marvel has, having defeated (by herself — well, herself and her squirrels) such villains as Doctor Doom, MODOK, Terrax, and Thanos, as well as Deadpool and Wolverine. So, since Squirrel Girl is such a formidable force, is her&nbsp;MCU introduction inevitable? That seems to be what actress Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect, Up in the Air) thinks, because while out promoting Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, Kendrick is pitching the idea that she would be the perfect choice to play Doreen Green, AKA Squirrel Girl. As Kendrick put it, “I don’t know what Squirrel Girl does other than be half squirrel, but I could be half squirrel!” Although Squirrel Girl was previously described as being a mutant (which is frequently a rights issue between Marvel and Fox), Marvel recently seemed to “retcon” the character&nbsp;to make her viable for MCU inclusion: her doctor in the comics stated that, “Doreen is medically and legally distinct from being a mutant, and I can never take this back.” As for when Squirrel Girl could join the MCU, the Russo Brothers recently said that the next Avengers: Infinity Wars movies (5/4/18 and 5/3/19) will fill feature 68 characters, with the implication being that at least a few of those 68 will be introduced in those movies. There’s also the possibility Squirrel Girl could get her own solo movie; after all, there was a time when people questioned the concept of Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy getting their own movies.2.&nbsp;IDRIS ELBA TO MAKE HIS DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH CRIME DRAMA YARDIEThere are lots of Hollywood careers that you rarely see share space on the same person’s filmography (cinematographer and actor, composer and makeup artist, etc). And then, there&nbsp;are actor-directors. There are tons of those, including people like&nbsp;Ben Affleck, Warren Beatty, Jodie Foster, George Clooney, Clint Eastwood, Angelina Jolie-Pitt… You get the idea. Well, we’ll soon be able to add another acclaimed director to that list, as Idris Elba (Pacific Rim, Prometheus, HBO’s The Wire) is now confirmed to make his directorial debut&nbsp;with&nbsp;the adaptation of the Victor Headley novel Yardie, about a Jamaican drug courier who decides to take his latest shipment of cocaine (to London) and set up his own drug dealing business (which obviously is not a great idea). It’s not yet known if Elba will also be starring in Yardie as either the drug mule or one of his business associates. “Yardie” is a British slang for a person from Jamaica.3. JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE TO COSTAR IN WOODY ALLEN’S 2017 MOVIEDirector/screenwriter Woody Allen has long maintained an annual work schedule that has allowed him to effectively be one of the most prolific directors on his level. For a while, Allen’s movies have been both filmed and released in the summer (or early fall) months. For example, his next film,&nbsp;Cafe Society, will be released next week (7/15/16), and in the early fall, he’ll start filming the movie which will be released in the summer of 2017. As is usually the case, we don’t know the premise (except that it’s set in New York City in the 1950s) or title of that 2017 release, but we’re starting to get an idea of the cast. The first announced star was Kate Winslet, and this week, she was joined by frequent “family film” star Jim Belushi&nbsp;(K-9, Curly Sue, Underdog). That was on Wednesday, and then on Thursday, Justin Timberlake and Juno Temple were also cast in what will be Woody Allen’s 48th film as director. This will be Allen’s first film working with all four actors/actresses.4.&nbsp;DOPE STAR KIERSEY CLEMONS MIGHT PLAY IRIS WEST ON THE FLASHIf you are like many TV and comic book fans and you regularly watch the CW’s surprisingly great The Flash, you are also likely&nbsp;familiar with the character Iris West, played on the show by Candice Patton. In the comics, Iris West is sort of a big deal for the Flash, because (not-really-a-spoiler-alert) she ends up marrying Barry Allen. We’ve known for well over a year that the live action movie version of The Flash would be played by Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin). What we haven’t known until this week is what other characters might appear in the film, or who might play them. Although there is no deal in play yet, it is looking like Dope director Rick Famuyiwa hopes to cast one of his Dope costars, Kiersey Clemons, in The Flash. Similarly, it is not confirmed that Kiersey Clemons would be playing Iris West, but out of all the characters central to The Flash, Clemons most resembles the portrayal of Iris West on the CW series (which is as a young African American blogger/reporter). Kiersey Clemons may seem young for the role (she played a teenager in Dope), but when Warner Bros releases The Flash on March 16, 2018, she’ll be 24 (and Ezra Miller will be 25). Kiersey Clemons recently appeared in Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, and will also costar in the remake of Flatliners.5.&nbsp;KATE MARA AND ED HELMS TO COSTAR IN TED KENNEDY DRAMA CHAPPAQUIDDICKIf you’re under a certain age, you may not know what Chappaquiddick refers to, but this Massachusetts island in 1969 became associated with an incident that quickly became a national political scandal. On July 18, 1969, U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy and his assistant Mary Jo Kopechne were in a car accident in which Kopechne died, and Kennedy later pled guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident. It was speculated that the resulting scandal and controversy was&nbsp;the reason that Kennedy chose not to run for president in 1972 and 1976 (and possibly why he lost when he did run in 1980). It was perhaps inevitable that Hollywood would eventually turn to Chappaquiddick as a source for a political drama, and that’s exactly what’s happening this year. Jason Clarke (Zero Dark Thirty, Terminator: Genisys) was recently cast as Ted Kennedy in Chappaquiddick, and this week, Clarke was joined by Kate Mara (Fantastic Four) and Ed Helms (The Hangover, Vacation). Mara will play Mary Jo Kopechne, while Helms will play Kennedy cousin Joe Gargan, who was one of the two men who helped Kennedy immediately after the car accident.&nbsp;Chappaquiddick will be directed by John Curran (The Painted Veil, Tracks).6.&nbsp;CLARA BOW, THE ORIGINAL “IT GIRL” TO GET HER OWN BIOPICThis is (almost certainly) coincidental, but one of the movies that is currently filming, and has therefore been making the news quite a bit recently, is the first half of a new adaptation of Stephen King’s IT. Now, follow our logic here: “It” (including the quotes) was the title of a 1927 silent film about a shop worker who sets her romantic sights on her wealthy boss, and it was also the movie that made a star out of Clara Bow. Clara Bow became one of the biggest movie stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood, and she also became known as the “It Girl,” which is pretty much where that term, as we now use it, came from. Now that we’ve set all that up, you can probably guess the rest, which is that the movie rights to David Stenn biopgraphy Clara Bow: Runnin’ Wild have been acquired by producers David Silver and Mike Witherill, whose credits as producer include John Wick and Drinking Buddies. Filming is expected to start in the first few months of 2017.&nbsp; It’s anyone’s guess right now who might be cast as Clara Bow in her biopic, so readers, who do you think would be a great choice?Rotten IdeaS of The Week3.&nbsp;ORIGINAL FLATLINERS STAR KIEFER SUTHERLAND JOINS REMAKEThere really isn’t much of a rabid fanbase for the 1990 psychological thriller Flatliners, but the cast was fairly impressive. Julia Roberts was not yet a movie star, but Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland both were, and both Oliver Platt and Hope Davis went on to have successful careers. The question of whether the world is yearning for a remake of this 48 percent Rotten movie is part of why we’re calling the following one of this week’s “Rotten Ideas.” Kiefer Sutherland has signed to also costar in the remake of Flatliners, although it is unclear what role he will play (such as whether this is actually a “sequel/reboot,” and Sutherland is playing the same character again). Sutherland is joining a young cast which includes Ellen Page (Juno), Diego Luna (Y Tu Mama Tambien), Kiersey Clemons (Dope), and Nina Dobrev (TV’s The Vampire Diaries). Swedish director Niels Arden Oplev, who directed the original adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (the Noomi Rapace version), will start filming the Flatliners remake in Toronto in September, 2016.2.&nbsp;SCOTT EASTWOOD MAY JOIN THE PACIFIC RIM SEQUELJohn Boyega (Finn from Star Wars: The Force Awakens) recently signed on to play the son of Idris Elba’s character, Stacker Pentecost, in the sequel to the giant-robots-vs-giant-monsters movie Pacific Rim. This week brought news of the movie’s next cast member, and it’s another “famous son,” this time literally. Scott Eastwood, AKA the-son-of-Clint, is now in talks for a role in Pacific Rim 2, which Universal Pictures and Legendary Pictures have scheduled for release on February 23, 2018.&nbsp;Pacific Rim 2 will mark the feature film directorial debut of Steven S. DeKnight, who has previously directed episodes of Smallville, Dollhouse, Angel, and Marvel’s Daredevil. Following the box office disappointments of several sequels this year, Pacific Rim 2 has become one project that some pundits are questioning.1.&nbsp;ALICIA VIKANDER’S TULIP FEVER PUSHED BACK TO 2017 ONE WEEK BEFORE RELEASEThere are obviously exceptions to any perceived “rule,” but generally, when a distributor pulls the plug on a movie one week before its release date, that’s not really great news (ie, “something” is going on). So, if you were all excited about being able to see Alicia Vikander, Dane DeHaan, Dame Judy Dench, and Christoph Waltz in the historical romantic drama Tulip Fever next week (7/15/16), yeah, that’s not happening. The Weinstein Company has pushed the drama about the true “Tulip Mania” financial scandal back several months to February 24, 2017 (where it will go up against God Particle and Sleepless). This leaves The Weinstein Company with just three movies left on their schedule for 2016: The Founder (8/5/16), Hands of Stone (8/26/16), and Lion (November) (but TWC is also active on the festival circuit, so the Weinsteins may yet acquire some movies at Toronto/Venice in September). In related news, Alicia Vikander’s Tomb Raider reboot was also scheduled this week for March 16, 2018, and another movie which got shuffled back from 2016 to early 2017 was Underworld: Blood Wars, which will now be released on January 6, 2017 (right at the start of one of Hollywood’s “dump months“).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Certified, rt","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/08170117/Incredibles-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"pixar-has-no-sequels-scheduled-after-the-incredibles-ii-in-2019-plus-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509193442724","title":"Lights Out Gets a Sequel, The Rocketeer Gets a Reboot, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Lights Out Gets a Sequel, The Rocketeer Gets a Reboot, and More Movie NewsOprah joins A Wrinkle in Time, Meryl Streep joins Mary Poppins Returns, and a Pulitzer Prize winner is tapped for... the Charlie's Angels reboot.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 29, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul, Jekyll, Lights Out 2, Mary Poppins Returns, and A Wrinkle in Time.This WEEK’S TOP STORYLIGHTS OUT SEQUEL GETS GREENLIGHTThis summer, some of the movies with big box office results (Warcraft with $433 million global, The Legend of Tarzan with $119 million domestic) are still described as “disappointments,” largely due to their budgets ($160 million and $180 million, respectively). Basically, when Hollywood studios swing for the fences, they sometimes pop out instead. One genre capable of success on a relative pittance of a budget is horror, which has already yielded summer hits in&nbsp;The Shallows, The Purge: Election Year, and The Conjuring 2. Most recently, Lights Out&nbsp;opened just last Friday, and by Wednesday, it already earned enough ($27 million in 5 days on a budget of $5 million) for its studio, New Line Cinema,&nbsp;to start development on a sequel. The film starred&nbsp;Teresa Palmer as a frightened sister&nbsp;who failed to stock up on&nbsp;spotlights and track lighting to battle a supernatural being only powerful in the dark. Director David F. Sandberg made his debut with Lights Out, based on a 3 minute YouTube short starring his wife, and will start work immediately on ideas for the sequel. It’s not yet known if any of the original cast will return, but the premise is such that really, it could revolve around a completely different family, dealing with a completely different “SBoPitD.” Lights Out 2 won’t, however, be David F. Sandberg’s next film as director, because he is currently directing Annabelle 2 (scheduled for May 19, 2017) for New Line Cinema. Speaking of Annabelle, the first film’s director, John Leonetti, also made the news this week for signing on to direct Wish Upon, a supernatural horror/thriller movie about a magic “wish box.”Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;OPRAH WINFREY JOINS AVA DUVERNAY’S A WRINKLE IN TIMEOne of the costars of director Ava Duvernay’s third feature film Selma (and also one of its producers) was former talk show host (and acclaimed actress) Oprah Winfrey, and Duvernay is&nbsp;enlisting Winfrey’s talents again&nbsp;for her second Hollywood film (and fourth feature). The costar of The Color Purple and The Butler is in final talks with Walt Disney Pictures to costar in their adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s fantasy novel A Wrinkle in Time, which&nbsp;is the first in a series of four books (which Disney undoubtedly hopes will be four movies) about children who travel through time looking for their lost scientist father. The screenwriter responsible for adapting A Wrinkle in Time was Jennifer Lee, who cowrote Disney’s Frozen. Oprah Winfrey will be costarring as Ms. Which, who along with (the not-yet-cast) Ms. Who and Ms. Whatsit, helps guide the children through their journeys. Walt Disney Pictures has not yet announced a release date for A Wrinkle in Time, but at this point, it’s probably most likely going to be in 2018.2.&nbsp;EDDIE REDMAYNE TO PLAY EDISON’S LAWYER IN THE LAST DAYS OF NIGHTVarious Hollywood producers have been trying for years (decades?) to get a movie about the “current wars” between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla (indeed, one of the projects is called just that, The Current Wars). Aside from a brief supporting appearance by Tesla (as portrayed by David Bowie, no less) in The Prestige, it’s looking like the next time we see either of them on the big screen&nbsp;will be in a completely different film. That movie will be called The Last Days of Night, and it will depict instead the legal conflicts between Edison and competitor George Westinghouse&nbsp;(whose company’s technology was based on Tesla’s). Based on this week’s casting, however, it sounds like Edison and Westinghouse might be supporting characters, with Edison’s lawyer instead the focus. Eddie Redmayne is now signed to star as young attorney Paul Cravath in The Last Days of Night. The film will be the third feature film for director Morten Tyldum, who made his debut with Headhunters&nbsp;and most recently directed The Imitation Game, another period piece film about a true story involving technological innovation (ie, one of the first modern computers).3. SONY HIRES A PULITZER PRIZE WINNER TO WORK ON… CHARLIE’S ANGELS (!?!)Back in the Golden Age of Hollywood, it was quite common for major figures in American literature to be hired to work on screenplays. Truman Capote, William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and John Steinbeck: they all did it. Maybe it’s just a different time, but you really don’t hear about today’s most acclaimed writers working for Hollywood as often. You certainly wouldn’t expect to hear this happening for something like a (undeniably cheesy) 1970s TV series adaptation, but that’s exactly what’s happening, because Pulitzer Prize winning playwright David Auburn is in talks with Sony Pictures to work on their Charlie’s Angels reboot. Auburn earned the prestigious&nbsp;distinction&nbsp;in 2001 for his play Proof, which was then adapted into a movie in 2005&nbsp;starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Sir Anthony Hopkins. If he signs on, David Auburn will be joining Elizabeth Banks (Pitch Perfect 2), who will be directing the film. It’s not yet known if any new spin will be put on Charlie’s Angels (such as maybe the Angels being all men?), if it will be a complete reboot, or if it will be a sequel to the movies starring Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu. We also don’t know if Elizabeth Banks might be costarring in Charlie’s Angels as well as directing.4.&nbsp;MERYL STREEP TO PLAY COUSIN TOPSY IN MARY POPPINS RETURNSAs one might expect from a movie adapting a single book in a series comprising several stories (eight, to be exact), many of the finer details of P.L. Travers’ Mary Poppins books didn’t make the cut the first time around (though that did make room for the musical numbers!). Having said that, this week’s news involves a character that actually didn’t debut until the second book, Mary Poppins Comes Back. Anyway, the big Mary Poppins Returns news this week is that Meryl Streep is in talks to join Emily Blunt as her character’s (much) older cousin Topsy. Like the first movie, Mary Poppins Returns will be also be a musical (hence the casting of Lin Manuel-Miranda), and Streep will also be singing in this movie, like she did in Into the Woods.&nbsp;Streep’s casting also makes Mary Poppins Returns (at least) a three-way reunion project, as it will be directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha), who also directed Into the Woods (which also featured Emily Blunt). Walt Disney Pictures has scheduled Mary Poppins Returns for Christmas Day, 2018.5.&nbsp;DISNEY’S THE ROCKETEER TO GET A SEQUEL/REBOOT CALLED THE ROCKETEERSSome movies are just way ahead of their time. Consider, for example, the case of Disney’s The Rocketeer, which was a superhero movie paying misty-eyed homage to classic comic book heroes (though it was based on a graphic novel only a few years old at that point). If The Rocketeer were released now, it might have a very good chance at being a major blockbuster, but in 1991, it was considered a box office flop, earning just $46 million from a budget of $40 million. Director Joe Johnston would eventually have superhero success with Captain America: The First Avenger — a retro superhero tale in its own right —&nbsp;but he had to wait 20 years. Walt Disney Pictures apparently never forgot about The Rocketeer, though, because 25 years later, the studio is working on a sequel (which is also effectively a reboot). The new project has a working title of The Rocketeers,&nbsp;and it’s set six years after the first film (which was set during World War II). For the reboot, the lead character will be a female African American pilot who “takes up the mantle of Rocketeer in an attempt to stop an ambitious and corrupt rocket scientist from stealing jetpack technology in what could prove to be a turning point in the Cold War.”&nbsp;The Rocketeers is being adapted by the screenwriting team of Matthew Spicer and Max Winkler (son of TV’s The Fonz, AKA Henry Winkler).6.&nbsp;INTERSTELLAR COSTAR MACKENZIE FOY TO STAR IN DISNEY’S THE NUTCRACKER AND THE FOUR REALMSAlthough Jessica Chastain was obviously one of the “above the credits” stars of Interstellar (along with Matthew McConaughey), much of her character’s story was actually portrayed by preteen actress Mackenzie Foy (who’s now 15). That movie is now almost two years old, but this week, Foy’s agents landed her the role which might just be her first real chance to get&nbsp;her own name “above the credits.” Mackenzie Foy has landed the lead role of “Clara” in Disney’s adaptation of The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, based upon the 1816 fairy tale The Nutcracker and the Mouse King by E.T.A. Hoffman. Like the other films in Disney’s ongoing “live action fairy tales” series, this movie is at least inspired (if not directly based upon) one of their classic animated movies, namely the “Nutcracker Suite” segement of the first Fantasia movie from 1940&nbsp;(Disney is also developing a live action movie based on that same film’s closing segment, Night on Bald Mountain). Morgan Freeman also joined the cast this week&nbsp;as Drosselmeyer, the mysterious eyepatch-wearing godfather of Clara&nbsp;who gives her the magic Nutcracker toy. Foy and Freeman are joining ballet star Misty Copeland, who was recently cast as the star of the film’s main musical dance number.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, directed by Lasse Hallstrom (What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, The Cider House Rules), doesn’t have a release date yet (but it’s likely to be in November/December, 2017).7. CAPTAIN AMERICA (CHRIS EVANS) TO STAR IN THE JEKYLL MOVIEIf you were a fan of the 2007 BBC series&nbsp;JEKYLL&nbsp;and were excited to hear about Jekyll being adapted into a new movie, we might have bad news for you (particularly if your excitement involved star James Nesbitt). That’s because Chris Evans (AKA Marvel’s Captain America), who admittedly has a lot of fans himself, is now in talks with Lionsgate to star in their adaptation of the BBC One series Jekyll. If Evans does indeed sign on, he will be playing Tom Jackman, “a modern-day descendant of Jekyll who is beginning to exhibit the trademark split personality.” Lionsgate appears to be greenlighting Jekyll at least partially as competition to Universal Pictures’ own plans to include a “Dr. Jekyll”-style character (to be played by Russell Crowe, starting in next summer’s The Mummy) in their new “cinematic universe” starring their classic Universal monsters.8.&nbsp;JESSICA CHASTAIN MAY JOIN JAKE GYLLENHAAL IN VIDEO GAME MOVIE THE DIVISIONThe argument could be made that the problem with some “video game movies” is that they are produced too late, after the game’s popularity has faded (and the reason for this is usually that movies take so long to work their way through development). For that reason, the recent announcement that Ubisoft (via their new branch, Ubisoft Pictures) is fast tracking an adaptation of Tom Clancy’s The Division, which was just released four months ago, is welcome news. Eventually, a major video game movie is bound to be both a box office and critical success, and Ubisoft Pictures appears to chasing that dragon’s tail (they also have Assassin’s Creed coming soon), at least if their recent cast announcements are any indication. We first heard about this movie when it was announced that Jake Gyllenhaal was in talks for a lead role, and it was also recently announce that&nbsp;the second talent now in talks with Ubisoft Pictures to star is two-time Academy Award nominee Jessica Chastain (The Help, Zero Dark Thirty). In Tom Clancy’s The Division, the player is an agent tasked with rebuilding a base of operations in a dystopian future Manhattan in the aftermath of a smallpox pandemic, while also investigating the outbreak and its cause. Ubisoft Pictures is also actively developing an adaptation of another Tom Clancy game, Splinter Cell, with Tom Hardy attached to star. We’re calling this only a “borderline” Fresh Development, because the Tomatometer history of video game adaptations isn’t particularly promising.Rotten Idea&nbsp;OF THE WEEK1.&nbsp;DIARY OF A WIMPY KID TO GET A SOFT REBOOT (BECAUSE, APPARENTLY, KIDS DON’T STAY KIDS)Earlier in the column, we discussed the box office potential of the horror genre, relative to their cost. Another type of movie that can be produced on “the cheap” (relatively) are kids movies (if they’re not fantasy, sci-fi, etc). Unfortunately, it’s a genre that has sort of faded from (theatrical) popularity in the last ten years. One movie that bucked the trend and became a franchise was 2010’s Diary of a Wimpy Kid (adapted from the popular children’s book by Jeff Kinney), with sequels in 2011 and 2012.&nbsp; Fox moved quickly on producing all three of those movies, since their star Zachary Gordon (and his costars) inevitably aged every year, and so the studio had a short window with which to work (and you know, maybe that’s why so few franchises like this exist). Fox knew they had a relatively good thing, however, and so this week brought us news that the studio is now&nbsp; developing a fourth Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie. To replace Zachary Gordon (who is now 18), Fox has instead cast 10-year-old Jason Ian Drucker, who should be good for at least three more movies (good luck in 2021, though, Jason!). &nbsp;The fourth movie will be an adaptation of Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul, and it will be directed by franchise veteran David Bowers, who also directed the second and third movies. We’re calling this the week’s Rotten Idea, because none of the previous three films in the franchise earned above a Rotten Tomatometer score of 53 percent, so there’s a very good chance that critics will assign this fourth film a similar score.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"kids, Network, popular, Sematary, Central, elevated, Disney+, renewals, kaiju, award, Disney, Endgame","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29145036/Lights-Out-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"lights-out-gets-a-sequel-the-rocketeer-gets-a-reboot-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509194707379","title":"Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart Will Sit Down for a Quiet Game of Jumanji, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart Will Sit Down for a Quiet Game of Jumanji, and More Movie NewsNew roles for Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson, Emma Stone, and Daisy Ridley, plus a Three's Company Movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 22, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Spider-Man: Homecoming, Daddy’s Home 2, Now You See Me 3, and Three’s Company.This Week’s Top StoryDWAYNE JOHNSON AND KEVIN HART TO REUNITE FOR JUMANJI REMAKEWe’re still nearly two months away from seeing Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart team up in the action comedy Central Intelligence (6/17/16). Their on-screen comedy chemistry is already, apparently, inspiring other studios to try to repeat it, because this week, the team of Johnson and Hart made some big casting news again. Sony Pictures has signed Dwayne Johnson&nbsp;and hopes to sign Kevin Hart&nbsp;to star in their planned remake of their 1995 fantasy comedy Jumanji. The late Robin Williams starred in the original movie as a man trapped in a magical jungle for over 25 years.&nbsp; Who’s playing who hasn’t been confirmed yet, but it’s likely that Hart is being eyed to play the trapped man-child, while Johnson seems like the more likely choice to play the “game” hunter trying to get him back into the game (along with his new friends). The Jumanji remake will be directed by Jake Kasdan (Sex Tape, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story), and Sony Pictures has already scheduled it for release on July 28, 2017, a date it currently has to itself (the week before Alien: Covenant, Pitch Perfect 3, and the animated comedy Blazing Samurai).Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;JOAQUIN PHOENIX: THE NEXT JESUS (IN MARY MAGDALENE)?There are a relative handful of characters (both fictional and historical) who have appeared in the most number of movies, with some examples being: Dracula and Sherlock Holmes (fictional); and Adolf Hitler and Napoleon Bonaparte (historical). Biblical figures have also appeared in many films, with the three most prolific being God, Moses, and Jesus Christ (not necessarily in that order). In the last few decades, the actors who have played Jesus Christ in feature films have included Willem Dafoe, Henry Ian Cusick, Jim Caviezel, Diogo Morgado, and most recently, Ewan McGregor (Last Days in the Desert). This week, we learned that the next major movie star who is now in talks to&nbsp;play Jesus Christ is Joaquin Phoenix. If Phoenix signs on, he will portray Jesus Christ in Mary Magdalene, which Rooney Mara (Carol) is already attached to star in as the titular Biblical figure.&nbsp;Phoenix and Mara previously costarred together in Spike Jonze’s 2013 film Her.&nbsp;Mary Magdalene will be the next film for Top of the Lake director Garth Davis, who will make his feature film debut with the upcoming film Lion, in which Rooney Mara also stars (along with Nicole Kidman, Dev Patel, and David Wenham).2.&nbsp;SCARLETT JOHANSSON TO PLAY ZELDA FITZGERALD IN THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE DAMNEDYou may have heard recently about the controversy over Scarlett Johansson’s casting in the (currently filming) live action remake of Ghost in the Shell (scheduled for 3/31/17). This week, Johansson signed on for a very different type of movie, as she is now&nbsp;attached&nbsp;to star as Zelda Fitzgerald in the biopic The Beautiful and the Damned. As her name suggests, Zelda Fitzgerald was the wife of author F. Scott Fitzgerald (The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night), and together, they were both famed figures of America’s “Jazz Age” of the 1920s. Later in life, Zelda Fitzgerald was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and spent her remaining years institutionalized. A director hasn’t been announced yet for The Beautiful and the Damned, which was adapted by screenwriter Hanna Weg (Septembers of Shiraz; cowriter of Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet). Scarlett Johansson is also expected to start filming later this year, reprising her role as Black Widow in Avengers: Infinity War Part I (5/4/18).3.&nbsp;DAISY RIDLEY AND J.J. ABRAMS TO REUNITE FOR SUPERNATURAL ROMANCE KOLMAJ.J. Abrams may be moving on to other non-Lucasfilm projects after Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he won’t still be reuniting with actors that he collaborated with on that film. We know that because this week, it was revealed that Abrams will be reuniting with Daisy Ridley (Rey in SW:TFA) on a “fantasy thriller” called Kolma. Abrams will be producing (not directing) Kolma, which is an English-language adaptation of the 2003 Israeli TV movie All I’ve Got (Kol Ma She’Yesh Li). Ridley will play an elderly woman who, when she dies, is given the chance to return to the day when, as a 22-year-old, the great love of her life died in a horrible car accident.&nbsp;Kolma will be directed by Marielle Heller, who made her feature film directorial debut last summer with The Diary of a Teenage Girl. The last time J.J. Abrams produced a movie he didn’t direct, it was released as 10 Cloverfield Lane, but it’s not expected that such a “fake out” will happen this time with Kolma (but you never know!). (Late breaking Friday news: Marielle Heller is also attached to direct a feature film adaptation of the HBO documentary The Case Against 8, about the legal battle to overturn California’s same sex marriage ban.)4.&nbsp;EMMA STONE AND KATE MCKINNON HIRED TO BE WOMEN IN BUSINESSEmma Stone is currently filming the 1970s-true-story-tennis-comedy Battle of the Sexes, playing Billie Jean King against Steve Carell’s Bobby Riggs. As much as that film is aiming (arguably) for a female audience, Stone is now attached to another such comedy. Stone, Kate McKinnon, and Jillian Bell (Workaholics) are all now signed on&nbsp;to star in the 20th Century Fox comedy Women in Business, which the studio won the rights to recently following a bidding war versus other major studios.&nbsp;Women in Business will be a road trip comedy, as the premise follows two corporate coworkers who are sent to Canada, where they are met up by a young intern. It’s currently unclear who has been cast to&nbsp; play the intern; it might be Jillian Bell, though Emma Stone is the youngest of the three actresses, at age 27 (Bell is 31, McKinnon is 32).&nbsp;Women in Business will be directed by Jake Szymanski, who will make his feature film debut this summer with Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, which is also a 20th Century Fox film.&nbsp; (Jake Szymanski also directed last year’s HBO sports mocumentary 7 Days in Hell.)5.&nbsp;SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING – MICHAEL KEATON OUT, ROBERT DOWNEY JR (IRON MAN) INMarvel Studios and Sony Pictures are going to start filming very soon on Spider-Man: Homecoming (7/7/17), so right now, there is a lot of casting news going on for that highly anticipated third take on the classic superhero. Last week, there had been a story about Michael Keaton potentially being cast as the (or “a”) villain in the film, but this week, we learned that is no longer the case. However, we do know now that Robert Downey, Jr. has been confirmed to be costarring in Spider-Man: Homecoming as Tony “Iron Man” Stark (which isn’t terribly surprising, if you’re familiar with the Civil War comic event). Tony Revolori (the bellboy from The Grand Budapest Hotel) and soap opera actress Laura Harrier have also been cast in key roles. As for who might be replacing Keaton as the Vulture (if Vulture is indeed one of the film’s villains, obviously), there was also a rumor this week that Jeff Goldblum might be in the running (because he basically hinted so).Rotten Ideas of The Week4.&nbsp;WILLEM DAFOE CAST AS MYSTERY “GOOD GUY” IN THE JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVIES, BUT… AS WHO?In other superhero movie casting news, Willem Dafoe is also set to return to the genre (following his turn as Green Goblin in the first Spider-Man), but this time, there’s two key differences.&nbsp; Willem Dafoe is following J.K. Simmons (formerly Marvel’s J. Jonah Jameson, now DC’s Jim Gordon) into the Justice League movies&nbsp;from Marvel to DC, and from a villain to a “good guy.” Other than that, however, we don’t know anything else about Dafoe’s character, although there has been speculation that he will not be playing a superhero. There are plenty of non-superhero characters in the extended DCU that Dafoe could&nbsp;play, especially if his&nbsp;character is indeed at least “sort of” a superhero. You can read some speculative “listicles” here, here, and oh look, here too. Warner Bros has scheduled Justice League Part One for November 17, 2017, and Justice League Part Two for June 14, 2019. Both films are expected to be directed by Zack Snyder (Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice), hence this being one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas” (not so much because of Willem Dafoe).3.&nbsp;WILL FERRELL AND MARK WAHLBERG TO REUNITE FOR DADDY’S HOME 2As we see frequently, when it comes to sequels, box office success is more generally a factor than critical success (ie, “duh”). So, when Paramount Pictures sees a worldwide box office take of $240 million for the relatively inexpensive comedy like&nbsp;Daddy’s Home, well, it’s obvious what this story is about. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg have both signed on with Paramount Pictures to return for Daddy’s Home 2. The premise hasn’t been revealed yet, but it’s easy to speculate that, as with similar sequels (Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, for example), the setup might be “basically the same, except the opposite.” Unless it’s not. Anyway, Daddy’s Home earned a Rotten score of just 32 percent, so this is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas.2.&nbsp;BEFORE NOW YOU SEE ME 2 IS EVEN OUT, NOW YOU SEE ME 3 ALREADY IN DEVELOPMENTWe’re still two months away from knowing if the sequel Now You See Me 2 can achieve the sort of “surprise” box office success that the first film did. However, Lionsgate is very much looking for every new franchise opportunity (with The Hunger Games done, and Divergent soon to be). So, the studio is eyeing Now You See Me&nbsp;and are already developing&nbsp;Now You See Me 3. For the third film, Lionsgate has recruited director Jon M. Chu, whose most recent film as director was last year’s flop adaptation of Jem and the Holograms. This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, not just because of Chu’s Tomatometer, but also because Now You See Me only earned a 49 percent Rotten score, and we don’t know how critics will receive Now You See Me 2.1.&nbsp;THE TV SHOW MOVIE NOBODY’S&nbsp;BEEN WAITING FOR: THREE’S COMPANYGripes about remakes or box office-fueled sequels are much more common, but another seemingly unending trend in Hollywood (dating back to the 1980s) is the urge to adapt old TV shows into new properties via feature films. The thing is, sometimes these movies actually work, but that doesn’t necessarily mean pundit columnists like this writer can’t be a little cynical about some of them. This week’s example is the 1977-1984 ABC sitcom Three’s Company, whose feature film rights New Line Cinema is now in negotiations to acquire. Presuming the deal goes through, New Line will be hiring the screenwriters of their Rotten (40 percent Tomatometer) 2009 comedy&nbsp;He’s Just Not That Into You to adapt the show into a movie. The Three’s Company movie, like the original sitcom, will be set in the 1970s and will presumably depict a straight man (Jack Tripper) who pretends to be gay so that he can live with two cute girls without getting in trouble with his/their landlords. The behind-the-scenes story of the making of Three’s Company was also adapted in 2003 as the TV movie Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Three’s Company.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Ghostbusters, adaptation, drama, streaming, Geographic, visit, One, harry, Walt, Plus","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/22161656/JumanjiKetchup.jpg","slug":"dwayne-johnson-and-kevin-hart-will-sit-down-for-a-quiet-game-of-jumanji-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509194711476","title":"Warner Bros.

May Launch a Hanna-Barbaraverse With S.C.O.O.B., and Other Movie NewsOh yeah, there's also stuff about Spider-Man, Han Solo, the Grinch, and four Avatar sequels.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 15, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about&nbsp;what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles&nbsp;as Avatar 5, Han Solo: A Star Wars Story, The Jungle Book 2, and Spider­Man: Homecoming.This Week’s Top StoryS.C.O.O.B. MAY LAUNCH THE HANNA BARBERA CINEMATIC UNIVERSEOne of the lessons we might hope was learned from the critical reaction to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is that with many pop culture adaptations, people hope the movie will be, you know, fun.&nbsp;Warner Bros is now in a situation where they have an ambitious slate of DC Comics adaptations scheduled for the next several years that will be sequels to a movie that wasn’t particularly fun at all.&nbsp;The studio does, however, have lots of other properties at their disposal.&nbsp;This week brought the news that Warner Bros might be planning on creating yet another new “Cinematic Universe” revolving around the many different Hanna-Barbera animated characters and series that the studio has the rights to produce. It’s really quite an impressive list that includes (and this is nowhere near comprehensive): Captain Caveman, Dynomutt, The Flintstones, The Herculoids, Hong Kong Phooey, The Jetsons, Jonny Quest, Josie and the Pussycats, Space Ghost, and Yogi Bear.&nbsp;At this weekend’s Cinema Con event, Warner Bros revealed that in 2018, the movie now called S.C.O.O.B. will be the studio’s “first shot at unlocking the whole Hanna-Barbera Universe.” That title refers, of course, to Scooby-Doo, but the abbreviation suggests that there might be a re-imagination of the premise.&nbsp;Might Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy all belong to some sort of investigative organization, ala Marvel’s S.H.I.E.L.D.?&nbsp; Will that then tie into other Hanna-Barbera properties (that are known to be in development), like Jonny Quest, Hong Kong Phooey, and Wacky Races, and maybe also franchises we don’t know about, like Grape Ape or Space Ghost?&nbsp; Here’s hoping that Warner Bros does indeed make this new “Cinematic Universe” fun and joyful.&nbsp; We’re not sure the movie really wants to see a “grimdark” live action adaptation of, say, Huckleberry Hound or Speed Buggy.Fresh Developments This Week1. DISNEY ALREADY WORKING ON A SEQUEL TO THE JUNGLE BOOKAs of this writing, it’s likely that most people have not yet seen this weekend’s big new movie from Disney, The Jungle Book.&nbsp;Early box office reports, however are already coming in, suggesting that it&nbsp;might be one of the year’s biggest early successes.&nbsp;The Jungle Book is also a critical success, with a Certified Fresh Tomatometer score of 94 percent.&nbsp;Considering all that, it’s perhaps not surprising that Walt Disney Pictures has taken quick action on developing a sequel, working with the same director (Jon Favreau) and screenwriter (Justin Marks).&nbsp;Although no specific stories were mentioned, Disney, Marks, and Favreau are reportedly going to adapt one of the several other stories about Mowgli written by author Rudyard Kipling.&nbsp;Despite the speed that Disney and their collaborators might attempt to produce their sequel, it’s likely, however, that it won’t be the next Jungle Book movie.&nbsp;That’s because Warner Bros and director Andy Serkis are continuing to work on their own adaptation of The Jungle Book (scheduled for 10/19/18).&nbsp;The impressive cast of that adaptation includes Christian Bale (Bagheera), Cate Blanchett (Kaa), Benedict Cumberbatch (Shere Khan), and director Andy Serkis himself as Baloo (via motion capture animation).2. MICHAEL KEATON MAY SWOOP DOWN ON SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING AS THE VULTUREWhen former Batman star Michael Keaton was cast in the drama Birdman as a movie star best known for playing a superhero, the joke was obvious to the point of brilliance.&nbsp;This week’s news reads like a continuation of that theme,&nbsp;but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.&nbsp;There were three big Spider-Man stories this week, and they’re all steps in the same process.&nbsp;First, after recent URL registrations led to speculation about the movie being titled Spider-Man: Homecoming, Sony Pictures confirmed that yes, their reboot focusing on Peter Parker as a teenager would indeed be called Spider-Man: Homecoming.&nbsp;At the same time, the blog Birth.Movies.Death ran a story claiming that a villain&nbsp;(or possibly “the” villain) in the film would be classic Spider-Man&nbsp;baddie The Vulture.&nbsp;Back when Sam Raimi nearly directed a fourth Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movie, there had been news that the villain might have been played by John Malkovich.&nbsp;Which leads us, finally, to the news that Michael Keaton is in early talks to play “a” villain (again, either the main villain or one of a few villains, we don’t know), in Spider-Man: Homecoming (7/7/17).&nbsp;That story did not specify that Michael Keaton will be playing The Vulture, but with his stylishly bald head as of late, the 64-year-old Best Actor nominee does indeed sort of resemble some depictions of The Vulture, right?3. HAIL, CAESAR! STAR ALDEN EHRENREICH: OUR NEW HAN SOLO?As of this writing (4/15/16), “Alden Ehrenreich” is still arguably very much not a household name.&nbsp;There are things going on in Hollywood, however, that suggest that within a few years, that may change.&nbsp;That’s because the news broke this week that after starting with an initial pool of thousands of young actors, Lucasfilm is now getting close to narrowing down their casting of the new Han Solo.&nbsp;It’s expected that Han Solo: A Star Wars Story (tentative title) will be the next Star Wars prequel (after Rogue One: A Star Wars Story).&nbsp;The film is currently scheduled for May 25, 2018, but that date may change to December 2018, to match the rest of the recent and upcoming Star Wars films. The premise hasn’t been confirmed, except that a younger Chewbacca will also be featured in the prequel.&nbsp;Alden Ehrenreich is currently best known for playing a 1950s singing cowboy actor in the Coen Bros’ recent comedy, Hail! Caesar.&nbsp;Ehrenreich is not yet officially signed, but he is reportedly the frontrunner in the final three, which also includes Taron Egerton (Kingsman: The Secret Service) and Jack Reynor (Transformers: Age of Extinction).4. YOU’RE A MEAN ONE, MISTER… CUMBERBATCH (AKA THE NEW GRINCH)The Google.com search bar can sometimes bring up some surprising results when you’re doing other unrelated searches.&nbsp;One example this writer came across while preparing this story is “Benedict Cumberbatch looks like the Grinch.”&nbsp;One really has to wonder if that was a factor in this week’s big news&nbsp;that Cumberbatch has signed with Illumination Entertainment to provide the voice of “The Grinch” in their new adaptation of Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas.&nbsp;Instead of a live action movie (like the one starring Jim Carrey), this film will be an animated film from the same studio that gave us The Lorax.&nbsp;Universal Pictures has scheduled Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch (a title which may change) for release on November 10, 2017.&nbsp;Benedict Cumberbatch also made the news this week for coming on board as producer&nbsp;on the independent drama Guantanamo Diary, about a man who was incarcerated at the U.S. base in Cuba for 14 years without being charged with a crime.5. CHANNING TATUM AND ELTON JOHN JOIN KINGSMAN: THE GOLDEN CIRCLEThe relative box office success of last year’s Kingsman: The Secret Service ($414 million on a budget of $81 million) has inspired 20th Century Fox to aim even higher&nbsp;for the sequel, Kingsman: The Golden Circle (6/16/17).&nbsp;In recent weeks, we have heard about the casting of such stars as Halle Berry, Julianne Moore, and former Game of Thrones costar Pedro Pascal.&nbsp;The ensemble cast grew even more this week with two big casting announcements.&nbsp;First, there was the news that pop singer Elton John is in talks to make his first appearance in a live-action narrative film in twenty years (the last of which was 1997’s Spice World).&nbsp;John’s role hasn’t been confirmed, but there is a strong possibility that he may be playing himself, because in the original The Secret Service comic book mini-series, Mark Hamill appeared as himself. (An element that was ditched for the movie, although Mark Hamill still took on a fictional role instead.)&nbsp;Channing Tatum also made news this week with this sequel, after he posted on his Twitter account (@ChanningTatum), that “I’m about to get all up in that Golden Circle. #Kingsman.”&nbsp;That came just one day after Sony Pictures confirmed the title of MIB 23, the sequel comedy in which Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum will crossover&nbsp;between their 21 Jump Street franchise and Sony’s lucrative Men in Black franchise.&nbsp;It’s not yet known to what extent Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones may (or may not?) appear in what will be the franchise’s fourth film.6. BIOPIC ALREADY IN DEVELOPMENT FOR THE LATE MERLE HAGGARDPeople who have actively followed film development for years might be familiar with this:&nbsp;a beloved celebrity dies, and soon after, plans are announced for a biopic about them.&nbsp;These films stand out because it’s far less common that a biopic is made about someone while they are still alive (though recent examples of this do include The Theory of Everything and Straight Outta Compton). &nbsp;On April 6, 2016, the world and music lovers in particular were saddened to hear about the passing of country singer and songwriter Merle Haggard, who died on his 79th birthday.&nbsp;Merle Haggard‘s life story has always read like a movie (including a life of crime and prison time), and this week, just six days after his death, we found out that exactly such a movie is now in the works.&nbsp;The news broke on April 12, 2016, that screenwriter Cliff Hollingsworth is working with a new production company to option and adapt Merle Haggard’s life story into a feature film biopic.&nbsp;Hollingworth previously worked with Akiva Goldsman on another biopic, the boxing film Cinderella Man, starring Russell Crowe.&nbsp;In other biopic news, Gary Oldman is now in talks to star as Winston Churchill in the British film Darkest Hour, about Churchill’s stormy ascension to the office of Prime Minister in 1940.Rotten IdeaS of The Week3. JASON STATHAM TO KICKBOX GIANT DINOSAUR SHARK IN MEGJason Statham has appeared in supporting roles in plenty of big studio releases like The Italian Job, Gnomeo &amp; Juliet, The Expendables, Spy, and Furious 7.&nbsp;However, the movies in which Jason Statham was the actual solo star, like the Crank and Transporter franchises, tend to have smaller budgets and/or were produced outside the Hollywood system.&nbsp;That’s an important distinction to make, because this week’s news sees Statham in the starring role of a big budget tentpole release from a major studio.&nbsp;Jason Statham has signed with Warner Bros and the Chinese production company Gravity to star in the long-in-development adventure film,&nbsp;Meg.&nbsp;In development since the late 1990s, Meg is an adaptation of the 1997 Steve Alten novel, MEG: A Novel of Deep Terror, which one can see as being influenced by both Jaws and the 1990s publishing phenomenon that was Jurassic Park.&nbsp;In the novel, the central character is a Navy deep sea diver who, during a Mariana Trench dive, sees a Carcharadon Megalodon, a 70-foot-long ancestor of the modern “great white shark.”&nbsp;Meg will be directed by Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure, Last Vegas), who currently is at the tail end of a seven movie Rotten streak that dates back to 1995, when While You Were Sleeping earned Turteltaub his second Fresh Tomatometer score. Jason Statham also currently has a Rotten record recently (only 25 percent of his last 16 films were Fresh), which is another reason this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.2. CAN DISNEY OVERCOME THE LIVE ACTION PETER PAN CURSE?Over the last 25 years, there have been three major attempts at a live action Peter Pan (not counting the J.M. Barrie biopic Neverland). Steven Spielberg’s 1991 adaptation Hook was a $300 million box office hit, but earned a 30 percent Rotten&nbsp;Tomatometer score.&nbsp;Then, in 2003, Universal Pictures had a critical success with Peter Pan, but the film was a box office disappointment, earning less worldwide than its $130 million budget.&nbsp;And then, last year, there was Joe Wright’s Pan, which was both a box office bomb and critical flop.&nbsp;After two Peter Pan failures in a row, one might guess that even a studio like Walt Disney Pictures would maybe step back and skip Peter Pan in their ongoing live-action fairy tale marathon extravaganza. That guess would apparently be mistaken.&nbsp;Walt Disney Pictures has recruited director David Lowery to start work on a live action adaptation of J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan, and more directly, the studio’s classic 1953 animated film Peter Pan.&nbsp;David Lowery apparently earned this new job at Disney due to the studio’s happiness with his work on their upcoming remake&nbsp;of Pete’s Dragon (8/12/16).1. JAMES CAMERON ANNOUNCES FOUR AVATAR SEQUELS, MUCH TO THE AMUSEMENT OF SOCIAL MEDIAA “problem” that can arise when a filmmaker like James Cameron takes as long as he does in between films (two narrative films in the last 21 years, namely&nbsp;Titanic and Avatar).&nbsp;That problem is that Cameron’s glacial pace means that he arguably does not and cannot respond to changes in audience expectations that might happen every, you know, decade or so.&nbsp;In the seven years since the release of Avatar in 2009, for example, 3D has gone from an exciting new gimmick to an arguably tired old gimmick.&nbsp;Also, unlike many other box office successes, Avatar has not benefitted from an avid fanbase (partly because unlike Marvel, DC, Star Wars, and Transformers, the movie didn’t have a pre-existing fanbase, either).&nbsp;With all that being said, James Cameron’s big announcement this week was all the more perplexing.&nbsp;That’s because he’s no longer planning on writing and directing three Avatar sequels: instead he’s planning on four Avatar sequels.&nbsp;Cameron and 20th Century Fox are also directly taking on Lucasfilm and Disney’s plans for releasing their Star Wars movies mostly in December, by doing the same with the next four Avatar movies.&nbsp;Avatar 2, Avatar 3, Avatar 4, and Avatar 5 (or whatever they end up being called) are now tentatively scheduled for the Christmas seasons in the years 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2023.&nbsp;And the reaction in social media has, as said, been one of befuddlement and disbelief. Overall, this was a big week for aging filmmakers and movie stars talking up their plans for sequels that may be past their due date.&nbsp;Russell Crowe also expressed his interest in starring in another Master and Commander movie, and Warren Beatty hopes to direct and star in a sequel to his 1990 comic strip adaptation Dick Tracy.&nbsp; Yes, really.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"dragons, Studios, Columbia, BET, Tour, show, comedies, Seed, justice, LGBT, space, boxoffice, twilight, Turner","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/15181353/Scooby-Doo-Universe-Ketcup.jpg","slug":"warner-bros-may-launch-a-hanna-barbaraverse-with-s-c-o-o-b-and-other-movie-news"},{"id":"47509193458092","title":"John Boyega Joins Pacific Rim 2, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})John Boyega Joins Pacific Rim 2, and More Movie NewsNew roles for Jennifer Lawrence, Anthony Hopkins, and Angelina Jolie, as well as a potential Battlestar Galactica reboot and a sequel to The Passion of the Christ.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 10, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (the stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about Battlestar Galactica, Pacific Rim 2, and remakes of both Murder on the Orient Express&nbsp;and Splash.This Week’s Top StoryJOHN BOYEGA: FROM STAR WARS TO PACIFIC RIMDirector/screenwriter/producer Guillermo Del Toro was so instrumental in creating the giant monsters/robots world of Pacific Rim that when he left the sequel, it seemed like a franchise would never happen. Quite the opposite is happening, as the Pacific Rim sequel is getting closer and closer to filming soon as the feature film debut of Steven S. DeKnight (who directed episodes of Smallville and Daredevil). This week, the Pacific Rim sequel landed a new star that gives us an idea of where the franchise is heading next. John Boyega, who played Finn in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, has been cast as&nbsp;the son of Stacker Pentecost, the robot pilot commander who was played in the first film by Idris Elba. Universal Pictures will distribute the film&nbsp;in 2017, with Legendary Pictures handling the release in China (similar to what both companies are currently doing with Warcraft). As for Idris Elba himself (who is not expected to return), he also made film development news this week. Kate Winslet is now in talks to join Elba in the romantic drama The Mountain Between Us, based on the 2010 novel by Charles Martin. The pair&nbsp;will play two injured survivors of a plane crash who fall in love while trying to escape the dangers of a remote frozen mountain.&nbsp;The Mountain Between Us will be the Hollywood debut of Dutch-Palestinian director Hany Abu-Assad (Omar, Paradise Now), working from a script cowritten by Chris Weitz, whose filmography includes About a Boy, The Golden Compass, Cinderella, and the upcoming Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;JENNIFER LAWRENCE TO STAR IN CORPORATE BIOPICOne of the big about faces in last year’s awards season was The Big Short, which marked a dramatic change for director/writer Adam McKay from his earlier comedies working with Will Ferrell (Anchorman, Step Brothers, Talladega Nights). McKay is sticking to serious and controversial “true story” material with the revelation this week that he is working on a movie about the medical company Theranos, and the controversy surrounding its core blood testing product which led to a drastic multi-billion-dollar stock re-evaluation. McKay recruited an impressive cast of stars for The Big Short, and he’s recruited a big star for his Theranos movie as well, as Jennifer Lawrence is attached to play Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. McKay and Lawrence will now start meeting with studios and producers in what is expected to become a heated bidding war for the timely drama. If development of the project continues expeditiously, it’s possible the movie could be produced soon enough to be a contender in this year’s awards season (much as&nbsp;The Big Short was also put together quickly in the spring/summer months of 2015).2.&nbsp;BATTLESTAR GALACTICA REBOOT MIGHT LAUNCH IN TIME FOR 40TH ANNIVERSARYWhen Star Wars became an industry-changing surprise hit in 1977, it inspired a wave of other science fiction movies and TV shows, including the short-lived 1978-1979 ABC TV drama Battlestar Galactica. The show, about a fleet of human refugees in outer space searching for the lost colony (Earth), only aired 34 episodes, but the franchise was popular enough that it was rebooted in 2004 as a more serious Sci-Fi Channel series that ran for four seasons and was followed by its own spinoffs and TV movie events. Through all of that time, and since the reboot series ended, there has been talk about a possible&nbsp;Battlestar Galactica movie that would reboot the franchise yet again. Director Bryan Singer (X-Men: Apocalypse, Superman Returns) was formerly developing that movie, but he has since departed the project (in 2014). Universal Pictures is still committed to the idea of reviving Battlestar Galactica as a new movie franchise, with two potential key figures making the news this week. Reportedly, Universal is hoping to recruit director Francis Lawrence to direct the Battlestar Galactica reboot. Lawrence is no stranger to serious blockbuster fare, having directed both I Am Legend (also a remake/reboot), and three quarters of&nbsp; The Hunger Games (all except the first film). In the meantime, while negotiations with Lawrence continue, Universal Pictures has also hired TV writer/producer Lisa Joy to start work on the Battlestar Galactica reboot screenplay. Joy has written and produced episodes of HBO’s upcoming Westworld series, as well as three episodes of Burn Notice.3.&nbsp;THE ALL-FEMALE SPINOFF OF OCEAN’S ELEVEN ATTRACTS MORE BIG NAMESAnother ambitious new film project that seems to be coming together relatively quickly is the all-female spinoff of the Ocean’s Eleven heist franchise (which some sources report will be called Ocean’s Ocho, suggesting eight stars instead of eleven). It was just reported last week that Cate Blanchett was to be the “Brad Pitt” to Sandra Bullock’s “George Clooney”, and this week, we heard about three more actresses that may be joining the ensemble. Reportedly, Elizabeth Banks is also likely to join the heist comedy, with Mindy Kaling and Helena Bonham Carter also recently signing on. If they are all confirmed, they bring the cast up to five, with three more characters yet to be cast. One of those characters is likely to be the one who would have been played by Jennifer Lawrence, whose involvement had been reported previously, but who has now moved on (probably due to scheduling conflicts with other projects, such as the Theranos movie reported above). The fourth movie in the Ocean’s Eleven franchise will be directed by Gary Ross (The Hunger Games, Seabiscuit), and it’s looking like Warner Bros might release the film sometime in 2017. In releated news, Elizabeth Banks also recently departed as director of the sequel Pitch Perfect 3 citing scheduling conflicts as the movie moved from filming this summer to the 2016-2017 school year, when Banks devotes more time to being “mom” to her two young children. Universal Pictures has scheduled Pitch Perfect 3 for December 22, 2017, and is currently looking for a new director.4.&nbsp;ANGELINA JOLIE TO BOARD THE REMAKE OF MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESSWe’ve known for a while now that 21st Century Fox is developing a remake of Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express, to be directed by Kenneth Branagh (who is also starring as Detective Hercule Poirot). But what we haven’t known is who Fox and Branagh were going to be casting in what; if it follows the example of the 1974 film, it&nbsp;could be a superstar-studded ensemble mystery drama. This week, we learned that the film&nbsp;will indeed have some big names, because the first star to join Kenneth Branagh might be Angelina Jolie Pitt, who is now in talks. It’s not yet known which of the thirteen possible murder suspects Jolie might play, but the possibilities include the characters originally played by Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, and Vanessa Redgrave, who&nbsp;were all European (Swedish, Hungarian, and British) in Agatha Christie’s novels. This new version of Murder on the Orient Express was adapted by screenwriter Michael Green, whose filmography includes 2011’s Green Lantern&nbsp;and the upcoming sequels Wolverine 3, Alien: Covenant, and the Blade Runner sequel. 21st Century Fox has scheduled Murder on the Orient Express for release on November 10, 2017. Angelina Jolie Pitt also made the news this week as the animated film The Breadwinner (which she is producing) has been picked up for distribution.&nbsp;The Breadwinner will tell the story of a young Afghan girl who is growing up in the shadow and control of the Taliban.5.&nbsp;PRODUCER BRIAN GRAZER TEASES US WITH HIS IDEAS FOR A SPLASH REMAKEThe last two weeks have seen lots of online attention given to the idea that perhaps audiences are experiencing “sequel fatigue,” which has resulted in disappointing box office for movies like Neighbors 2, X-Men: Apocalypse, Alice: Through the Looking Glass, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. As such, the tone this week seems to have shifted back to remakes (like the aforementioned Murder on the Orient Express). Although he’s apparently not yet ready to make any official announcements, producer Bryan Grazer was quoted this week about his idea for remaking the 1984 hit comedy Splash (starring Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah as the mermaid he falls in love with). Here’s what Grazer had to say: “I’m actually gonna do Splash today, and I can’t say. I’m actually going to do it from the point of view of — I can’t say anything about it. There’s a movie star involved or gonna be involved. I haven’t announced it.” Grazer’s plans to remake&nbsp;Splash&nbsp;join a mini-trend of upcoming “sea people” movies, including Guillermo Del Toro’s next film (reportedly a 1950s-set romance about a trapped “merman” played by Richard Jenkins), DC Comics’ adaptation of Aquaman coming in 2018 (7/27/18), and two different adaptations of The Little Mermaid that are in various stages of development. Bryan Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment partner Ron Howard also made the news this week, as he is now attached to direct a science fiction novel adaptation called Seveneves, about the fate&nbsp;of humanity some five thousand years in the future.Rotten Ideas of The Week4.&nbsp;SACHA BARON COHEN TO CAST A SPELL AS MANDRAKE THE MAGICIANWe are still several months from the release of Marvel Studios’ Doctor Strange, but this week we already heard about another magician-turned-superhero, Mandrake the Magician. The character is most famous as a comic strip character who first appeared in 1934, and whose adventures have been adapted for radio, serial films, television, and TV animation (as one of the stars of the 1986-1987 series Defenders of the Earth&nbsp;alongside Flash Gordon and The Phantom). The idea of a Mandrake the Magician movie has been kicking around Hollywood for many years now (like three other films about 1930s heroes, namely&nbsp;Buck Rogers, Doc Savage, and Flash Gordon). This week, we learned that it might actually happen, with the news that comedian Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat, Bruno) is now attached to star. The project doesn’t yet have a screenwriter, but Get Hard director Etan Cohen is attached to the project. We’re calling Mandrake the Magician one of the week’s (borderline) “Rotten Ideas” due to the 29 percent Tomatometer score for Get Hard. Another factor is the perceived low audience demand for the&nbsp;movie (are people really that excited about a Mandrake the Magician movie… in 2016?).3. SIR ANTHONY HOPKINS BRINGS HIS GRAVITAS AND REPUTATION TO… TRANSFORMERS?Just after last week’s&nbsp;Ketchup went live, some fairly major news started to trickle out about the fifth Transformers movie, Transformers: The Last Knight (6/23/17). Since then, it has been confirmed that Sir Anthony Hopkins has joined the cast, though we don’t know yet what sort of character he might be playing. One idea that is floating around out there is that Anthony Hopkins might be taking over the role of Unicron, voiced by Orson Welles in Transformers: The Movie, but that’s completely unconfirmed at this point. This is something of a huge “get” for the Transformers franchise, due to Hopkins’ reputation as an actor, and one could argue that Hopkins needs Transformers (or any huge blockbuster project like it), because his&nbsp;latest movie,&nbsp;Misconduct,&nbsp;earned a rather amazing distinction: Variety reported this week that upon its UK release, Misconduct earned a box office of just $141 (not millions, or thousands… just $141).2.&nbsp;MEL GIBSON WORKING ON A SEQUEL TO THE PASSION OF THE CHRISTFor people who follow box office trivia closely, Mel Gibson’s 2004 Biblical epic The Passion of the Christ is something of a groundbreaking anomaly. For one thing, it was an R-rated religious epic filmed entirely in languages other than English. Gibson’s film also was released far before the many other Christian films that became something of a box office phenomenon in recent years (Heaven is for Real, Miracles from Heaven, etc). So, perhaps it shouldn’t have been surprising that screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) revealed he is writing a sequel to The Passion of the Christ for Mel Gibson to direct. The sequel is expected to focus on Christ’s resurrection and the days before and after Christ’s ascension. Although The Passion of the Christ was a $370 million global box office blockbuster, the film also earned a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 49 percent.1.&nbsp;HIGHLY ANTICIPATED JUSTICE LEAGUE DARK GOING DIRECT-TO-VIDEO (AND ANIMATED)For many fans of DC Comics, one of their most anticipated feature film projects may have been Guillermo Del Toro’s much-reported idea of uniting various DC supernatural characters as a reaction to Justice League, variously known as either Dark Universe, or Justice League Dark. Del Toro’s film would have featured such characters as John Constantine, Swamp Thing, Zatanna, and Etrigan the Demon. This week, we learned that Justice League Dark is indeed going to “happen,” but it’s… not going to be a theatrically-released feature film, or even live action. Instead, Warner Bros Animation is reportedly now working on producing Justice League Dark as one of their upcoming direct-to-video animated films. In the category of “animated feature films,” DC and Warner Bros have long had much more success than Marvel, which stopped producing their movies in 2011, with Thor: Tales of Asgard. We’re calling this the Rotten Idea of the Week, because Justice League Dark had been one of those potential DC Comics adaptations that might have helped define the new DC Cinematic Universe, along with such non-Justice League movie concepts as Shazam!, Lobo, and Booster Gold (all three of which have been talked about in recent months). Having said that, we do appreciate the silver lining that we will at least get a Justice League Dark animated movie.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"drama, Games, Chernobyl, Syfy, black, disaster, USA, league, Crackle, south, Fox, worst","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10171304/John-Boyega-Pacific-Rim-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"john-boyega-joins-pacific-rim-2-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509193471410","title":"Alicia Vikander Will Be Tomb Raider‘s New Lara Croft, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Alicia Vikander Will Be Tomb Raider's New Lara Croft, and More Movie NewsSherlock Holmes 3 and a Shinobi adaptation are coming, but Marvel's Inhumans is not, plus new roles for Paul Rudd and Jamie Foxx, but not Will Ferrell.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 29, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Dennis the Menace, Sherlock Holmes 3, and Shinobi; and new roles for Jamie Foxx and Paul Rudd.This Week’s Top StoryALICIA VIKANDER IS YOUR NEW LARA CROFT, TOMB RAIDERWhile superhero movies continue to dominate the box office, the lucrative video game industry (which now makes almost as much money each year as Hollywood does)&nbsp;remains another potential source for adaptations. In 2016 alone, we will soon have movies based on Angry Birds, Warcraft, and Assassin’s Creed. One of the franchises that has been attempting a reboot is Square Enix’s Tomb Raider, which was previously made into a pair of movies starring Angelina Jolie. Unfortunately, those movies both received Rotten Tomatometer scores: Lara Croft – Tomb Raider (19%) and Lara Croft – Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (24%). The challenge, then, is not only to deliver an entertaining adventure movie that audiences enjoy, but for the film also to win over critics this time around. Naturally, there’s also the question of who to cast as the British adventurer Lara Croft. There had been stories that Daisy Ridley (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) was in talks for the role, but this week, we learned the role will be going to another recent “It Girl” instead. Alicia Vikander, the Swedish star/costar of Ex Machina, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and The Danish Girl, has been cast as the new Lara Croft in the reboot of Tomb Raider. The Jolie movies were produced by Paramount Pictures, but the rights now reside with MGM and GK Films (World War Z, Rango, Hugo). The production looks like it might be particularly Scandinavian-themed, as director Roar Uthaug (The Wave) is himself Norwegian. There are currently no details about what Lara Croft’s new adventure might be (or whether it will be adapting any specific video game), but what we do know is that after many, many other screenwriters worked on it, the Tomb Raider script is currently being redrafted by screenwriter Evan Daughtery (Divergent, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). As for Daisy Ridley, she also made the news this week for signing on to the indie drama The Lost Wife, about a romance in Prague in 1939 torn apart by the threat of the invading Nazi’s.Fresh Developments This Week1. JAMIE FOXX TO BE THE HUMAN SURROUNDED BY PUPPETS IN THE HAPPYTIME MURDERSOver the last several years, the Jim Henson Company has supervised something of a career comeback for The Muppets. Another puppet-themed project that JHC has been working on, however, will involve an entirely new group of puppets. That project is called The Happytime Murders, and it is frequently compared to Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Avenue Q, as it it set in a world where humans and puppets live side-by-side. This week, we finally learned what lucky actor will get to represent us humans in this crazy world.&nbsp;The answer is Jamie Foxx, who is now in early talks with STX and the Jim Henson Company to star in The Happytime Murders. Let’s quote Variety for their summary of the film’s premise: “The raucous comedy explores a world where puppets and humans live side by side, and the puppet stars of the iconic TV show ‘The Happytime Gang‘ are some of the biggest celebrities around. But off camera, the family-friendly cast leads the kinds of lives that would make a tabloid writer blush.” Jamie Foxx is in talks to play the human police detective working with a puppet partner to&nbsp;investigate a series of murders of puppets involved with the Happytime Gang TV show.&nbsp;The Happytime Murders will be directed by Brian Henson (Jim’s son), whose previous credits include The Muppet Christmas Carol and Muppet Treasure Island, and&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;expected to have a much darker tone (probably PG-13) than anything The Muppets have starred in, which is why it is very specifically not called a Muppets movie.2. THE CATCHER WAS A SPY (AND ALSO PAUL RUDD!)&nbsp;Paul Rudd may have to spend a lot of the next few years costarring as Ant-Man in various Marvel movies (including Ant-Man and the Wasp, dated for 7/6/18), but like some of his Marvel costars, he will still have time for other movies as well. One of those new projects will be a departure from the broad comedies and little indie dramas that Rudd used to star in before Ant-Man. That’s because he’s set to star as Chicago White Sox baseball star Moe Berg in the World War II drama The Catcher Was a Spy. The film will adapt the true story of Moe Berg‘s life, focusing on the years in the 1930s and 1940s when he operated as a spy for the O.S.S. (the precursor of the CIA). Specifically, the film will focus on Berg’s efforts to work against Germany’s plans to perfect atomic bombs before the Allies (spoiler: they didn’t). Berg also had the distinction of being a Jewish baseball player and a member of the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum.&nbsp;The Catcher Was a Spy will be directed by Ben Lewin (The Sessions), working from a script by screenwriter Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan, The Patriot).3. DISNEY NOW HAS BIG COMPETITION: COMCAST/NBCUNIVERSAL BUYS DREAMWORKS ANIMATIONThis particular story may read a little bit like&nbsp;“inside baseball” to casual movie fans, but the implications are potentially seismic. This week, following years of speculation, DreamWorks Animation was purchased by Comcast, the corporate owners of NBCUniversal, and further down the line, Illumination Entertainment. The deal was made for a cash transaction of $3.8 billion, which is seen as a premium over the previous price of DreamWorks Animation stock. DreamWorks Animation will continue to be a separate brand, but it will now operate under the supervision of Illumination Entertainment head Chris Melelandri, while Jeffrey Katzenberg will leave DWA to focus on a new enterprise called DreamWorks New Media and projects like “AwesomenessTV.” For the average moviegoer, this won’t initially mean much, other than some shuffling of release dates, since DWA movies like Trolls, Boss Baby, Captain Underpants, The Croods 2, and How to Train Your Dragon 3 will no longer be competing against Illumination movies like The Secret Life of Pets, Sing, Despicable Me 3, and Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch. Box office-wise, the question now will be whether this puts Universal Pictures even closer to someday beating the juggernaut that Walt Disney Pictures has become with its ownership of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm.4. NINJA VIDEO GAME SHINOBI SNEAKS INTO THE&nbsp;HEADLINESThe Weekly Ketchup is compiled every Friday afternoon, and like any such column with a hard deadline, it’s always fun when someone in Hollywood decides to sneak out a big announcement at the very last&nbsp;moment. (This column doesn’t write itself!) This week, something particularly ironic happened because the movie that snuck into the online consciousness like a big surprise is a ninja movie. The video game company SEGA is teaming up with Hollywood producer Marc Platt&nbsp;to start development of a movie based on their long-running ninja video game franchise Shinobi. The first Shinobi&nbsp;game debuted in arcades in 1987, and it was followed by over a dozen other Shinobi&nbsp;games (or spinoffs)&nbsp;in the nearly 30 years since. Marc Platt is a diverse producer whose films have included comic book adaptations like Wanted and Scott Prilgrim vs the World, as well as films from acclaimed directors like Steven Spielberg (Bridge of Spies), Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive), and Jonathan Demme (Rachel Getting Married). The news of Shinobi someday becoming its own potential movie franchise is especially interesting since one of the next video adaptations&nbsp;will be the similarly-themed (though with very different settings) Assassin’s Creed (12/21/16).5. THE GAME IS AFOOT! HERE COMES SHERLOCK HOLMES 3After Sherlock Holmes was a box office hit in 2009, it was (relatively) quickly followed by a sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows in 2011. Those movies, however, are now nearly five years old, and one could argue that dust is starting to settle on the Downey Jr./Law/Ritchie franchise. That doesn’t mean, however, that we won’t see all of them return someday for a third movie.&nbsp; We now know that because Warner Bros has hired screenwriter James Coyne to start work on a Sherlock Holmes 3 screenplay. Coyne’s previous films bypassed the traditional feature film circuit: 2013’s Vikingdom (43 percent Rotten) and 2014’s Puncture Wounds. It is expected that Jude Law, Robert Downey Jr. and director Guy Ritchie will all return for Sherlock Holmes 3. In related news, Benedict Cumberbatch recently started filming series 4 of his own Sherlock made-for-TV movies, almost immediately after wrapping up Marvel’s Doctor Strange (11/4/16). We’re keeping this one in the “Fresh Developments” category because of the Tomatometer scores of the first two movies (70 percent and 60 percent, both Fresh).Rotten Ideas of The Week4.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN PROBLEM CHILDREN, PART 1: DENNIS THE MENACE TO MENACE AGAINWhen it comes to “kids movies,” Hollywood sort of has a thing for trying to reboot franchises that are way, way, way past their expiration date, especially for little kids. Consider, for example, the live action reboots of titles like The Little Rascals, Annie, and The Peanuts Movie. Well, another such reboot is in the works, as Warner Bros has started development on a new adaptation of Dennis the Menace. In something of a “huh?” move, Warner Bros has decided to hire screenwriter Stacey Menear, whose one credit to date is the recent horror film The Boy,&nbsp;to adapt this new version of Dennis the Menace.&nbsp;Most of the Dennis the Menace movies of the last 30 years have gone direct to video, but there was one theatrical release, starring Walter Matthau, which earned a Rotten score of just 23 percent.3. THIS WEEK IN PROBLEM CHILDREN PART 2: THE OMEN PREQUEL, THE FIRST OMENIn the 1976 paranoia horror classic, The Omen, an American diplomat’s wife gives birth to a baby which, over the next few years, seems to cause people around him to do evil things (or have evil things done to them), and it turns out that little Damien is really the devil’s kid. This week, 21st Century Fox announced plans for a prequel to that film called The First Omen. The details of the premise haven’t been revealed yet, but the title seems to suggest that there was another kid before Damien Thorne, sometime before 1976. But since it’s a prequel, don’t we already know that the devil’s plan didn’t work out the first time? What’s the point of making a prequel movie about that “first” kid? Well, maybe that’s a question that screenwriter Ben Jacoby has already figured out.&nbsp; Fox has also already hired director Antonio Campos to direct, coming off his recent Sundance hit Christine (not to be confused with the Stephen King book/movie about the demonic car), and David S. Goyer is producing it.2. THIS WEEK IN MARVEL: INHUMANS PULLED FROM SCHEDULE, MORE WOLVERINE 3 CASTING NEWSThere had been rumbling in recent weeks that Marvel Studios might be changing their collective mind about the Inhumans movie, which had once been scheduled for November 2, 2018, and then for July 12, 2019. Well, we now know that Marvel Studios has removed Inhumans from their schedule entirely. It should be noted, of course, that this doesn’t mean that there will never be an Inhumans movie, as plenty of movies have eventually been made after being stuck in “development hell” for years (or even decades!). This change leaves lots of questions, including whether the Inhumans (such as Black Bolt, Medusa, Chrystal, Lockjaw, and Karnak) will still appear in other Marvel movies, without appearing their own movies. (After all, there are plenty of Marvel characters in Marvel’s movies who haven’t had their own movies yet, like Black Widow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Vision, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, etc.) We’re calling this a “Rotten Idea” because it seemed like Inhumans had the potential to be another “surprise” from Marvel, a la Guardians of the Galaxy. After all, who doesn’t want to see a bunch of freaky superhuman types (like a lady with crazy moving hair) being teleported around the world by a giant dog? In other Marvel news (albeit on the Fox side of things), there was more casting news this week for Wolverine 3 (3/3/17), and they’re both British gentlemen. Richard E. Grant&nbsp; will play a “mad scientist” type,&nbsp;and frequent Ricky Gervais collaborator Stephen Merchant has also landed a role. Finally, in the very concrete “spoilers” category, we learned this week that Nathan Fillion will again be in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but the role, and the setting for the role, are all very, very, very spoilery. You’ve been warned.1.&nbsp;THE REAGAN MOVIE (WHICH WILL NOT BE STARRING WILL FERRELL)In film development news, we’re used to movies taking years and years to happen. What is far less common is news that changes within a few hours or days. But that’s what happened this week with a “Black List” screenplay called Reagan, about the President of the United States who was struggling with Alzheimer’s late in his life. This story starts on Wednesday morning, when Variety reported that Will Ferrell was “attached to star” as President Reagan in Reagan. Reportedly, the film (if it is still produced) would begin “at the start of the then-president’s second term when he falls into dementia and an ambitious intern is tasked with convincing the commander-in-chief that he is an actor playing the president in a movie.” President Reagan’s family was quick to respond, with his daughter Patti Davis taking the lead, penning an open letter directly to Will Ferrell on Thursday. That leads us to this morning, and the news that Will Ferrell is “not pursuing” the Reagan comedy project. As to who might replace Will Ferrell, the news also broke today that for a planned table read of the Reagan screenplay, both Lena Dunham (who was eyed to play Peggy Noonan) and Tony Goldwyn have now dropped out of doing the read.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"breaking, series, golden, Cartoon, service, John, Alien, Netflix, Films, video, streaming","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/29184811/Alicia-Vikander-Lara-Croft-.jpg","slug":"alicia-vikander-will-be-tomb-raiders-new-lara-croft-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509194731966","title":"Elizabeth Banks Joins Power Rangers as Rita Repulsa, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Elizabeth Banks Joins Power Rangers as Rita Repulsa, and More Movie NewsSteven Soderbergh jumps behind the camera again, big names join biopics, MacGyver gets a movie, and Keanu Reeves goes to China.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 5, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (the stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as MacGyver, Magic Tree House, Power Rangers, and the 9th and 10th movies in the Fast and Furious franchise.This Week’s Top StoryELIZABETH BANKS JOINS POWER RANGERS AS RITA REPULSA(Photo by Carlo Allegri / Getty Images)&nbsp;In the history of theater and film, there are some truly great roles for men. Even in 2016, the argument can still be made that female actresses don’t necessarily have the same options, quality wise, that their male counterparts do. Of course, it’s all relative. Will any male actor ever get to play Rita Repulsa from Power Rangers? (No, we’re not serious, though that’s sort of the point here.) Even for this role, the Power Rangers producers were not only able to cast a “name actress,” but someone who is arguably one of the hottest and most demanded working today. That’s because it’s Elizabeth Banks who has signed with Lionsgate to play villain Rita Repulsa in next year’s Power Rangers (3/24/17). The huge hair-horns of Rita Repulsa were originally worn by Japanese actress Machiko Soga in the 1990s Japanese footage, and by Carla Perez and Julia Cortez in the American segments and the 1995 live action movie. Elizabeth Banks will have the distinction of being the first Caucasian actress to play Rita Repulsa (not counting the voice dubbing done by Barbara Goodson and Susan Brady), and she joins the already announced cast of five Power Rangers, who are all considerably less famous than her.&nbsp;Power Rangers will be directed by Dean Israelite (Project Almanac) from a script by the screenwriting team of Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz (cowriters of Thor, X-Men: First Class, and Agent Cody Banks).Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;DIRECTOR STEVEN SODERBERGH MIGHT END HIS “RETIREMENT” SOONIn 2013, director Steven Soderbergh (50 years old at the time) announced his retirement from directing feature films, declaring, “movies don’t matter any more.” Which, of course, didn’t mean he&nbsp;fully retired. In the last three years, Soderbergh has produced Citizenfour, edited and filmed (as cinematographer) Magic Mike XXL, and directed every episode of the Cinemax series The Knick. This week, in what was a series of confusing and frequently conflicting stories, we started to hear that maybe Steven Soderbergh will indeed return to directing feature films, and relatively soon.&nbsp; When the fact-checking dust settled, it appeared that the news we could more safely proclaim was that Steven Soderbergh is indeed attached to direct a film called Lucky Logan. Channing Tatum is reportedly attached to star, with Michael Shannon possibly also involved. (Some of the week’s stories were about a film called Hillbilly Heist, and mentioned Matt Damon, but as of this writing, those stories may have been debunked.) The premise of Lucky Logan (sometimes called Logan Lucky this week) is not yet known, except that like Steven Soderbergh’s three Ocean’s&nbsp;movies, it will also be a “heist movie.”2.&nbsp;VIN DIESEL ANNOUNCES DATES FOR THE “LAST” TWO FAST AND FURIOUS MOVIESMost film franchises eventually come to an end before ever getting beyond a certain number of films. Until December, for example, there had “only” been 6 Star Wars movies, and there were “only” eight Harry Potter movies. It is far rarer that a single franchise keeps going with (mostly) the same cast into the double digits. Vin Diesel confirmed this week via Instagram that he and Universal Pictures plan on doing exactly that with the Fast and Furious franchise. Declaring “2 decades 10 films 1 saga,” Diesel posted release dates for Fast 8 (4/14/17), the 9th movie (4/19/19), and the 10th movie (4/2/21). That last film’s date is particularly worth noting because it comes just two months before what will be the 20th anniversary of the release date of the franchise’s first film, The Fast and the Furious, which was released on June 22, 2001. We still don’t know much else about the 9th and 10th movies, except that when the last film comes out, Vin Diesel will be 53 years old.3. THIS WEEK IN BIOPICS: NEW ROLES FOR JESSICA CHASTAIN, ROONEY MARA, AND KEIRA KNIGHTLEYIn this year’s awards season, there were the usual number of films based on real people, but many of the “biopics” that were expected to have good chances have ended up either not being recognized, or not as well as they might have been expected.&nbsp; (Specifically, biopics that didn’t receive Best Picture nominations at the Academy Awards include The Danish Girl, Joy, Steve Jobs, Straight Outta Compton, Trumbo, and Truth). That isn’t stopping producers from continuing to make such movies, of course. This week, there were three different film development stories about actresses being in some stage of negotiations for roles based on real people. First, there is Jessica Chastain, who is in talks to star in Woman Walks Ahead as Catherine Weldon, a Brooklyn artist who in 1889 traveled to the Dakota Territory to “help Sitting Bull hold onto land that the government was trying to wrest from his people.” Woman Walks Ahead will be directed by Generation Kill director Susanna White. It’s not yet known who will play Sitting Bull. Another historical figure in the news this week is Mary Magdalene, who if deals work out, might be played in an upcoming film by Rooney Mara. Finally, there is the French author known under the pen name Colette, whose famous works include the novels Gigi and Cheri. Keira Knightley is now in talks to play Colette, in a film to be directed by Wash Westmoreland (Still Alice).4.&nbsp;JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT AND CHANNING TATUM TO STAR IN R-RATED MUSICAL COMEDYA few years ago, there was a story about Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt possibly starring in a new adaptation of the gangster musical Guys and Dolls. It’s possible that might still happen someday, but there’s also been no real news about that project since 2013. Instead, it’s sounding now like the two actors and friends might instead collaborate on a completely different (and original) musical. Universal Pictures has picked up the rights to an untitled new R-rated musical comedy in which both&nbsp;Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are attached to star. The untitled comedy will be produced by Marc Platt, whose credits also include&nbsp;Ricki and the Flash, the long-in-development Wicked movie, and this summer’s La La Land, which is also an original musical film. The premise is not yet known, except that it involves a pair of pilots who go off on an adventure, and that it is expected to earn an R rating. This Tatum/JGL musical comedy is now being written by screenwriter Michael Bacall, who previously worked with Channing Tatum on the two 21 Jump Street movies (Bacall also cowrote Scott Pilgrim vs the World with Edgar Wright). Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt previously costarred together in Havoc, Stop-Loss, and they both danced (though not with each other) three years ago at the Oscars. And of course, you can see Channing Tatum dance this weekend in The Coen Brothers’ Hail, Caesar!5. ROGEN, HADER, AND GALIFIANAKIS TO STAR IN OUTER SPACE COMEDY THE SOMETHINGBack in the 1950s and 1960s heyday of NASA and the Mercury/Apollo missions, astronauts were depicted as the best of the best (see: The Right Stuff). Oh, how the mighty have fallen, as Universal Pictures has cast a new trio of astronauts who cut a very different figure. Seth Rogen, Bill Hader, and Zach Galifianakis are all now signed to star in the outer space comedy The Something. The three comedians will play astronauts who have been stuck on their ship for years when they finally come across another ship. And then, ostensibly, hilarity and hijinks ensue. The Something will be directed in his feature film debut by screenwriter Rodney Rothman, who cowrote both 22 Jump Street and Grudge Match. Rose Byrne, who plays Rogen’s wife in the Neighbors movies, was reportedly in talks for a role in The Something last summer, but she was not mentioned in this week’s news.6.&nbsp;THE SEARCH FOR THE NEXT HARRY POTTER LEADS TO MAGIC TREE HOUSELionsgate, the studio behind both The Hunger Games and the Divergent films (via Summit), braced for bad news this week as their quarterly finals were lower than expected, at least partially because The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2&nbsp;failed to meet expectations. Still, the studio expects to increase their number of wide releases in 2017 from 13 to 17 films, and&nbsp;part of the challenge is to find new franchises for the future. One effort in that direction was revealed this week, as Lionsgate has acquired the film rights to all 54 books in author Mary Pope Osborne’s Magic Tree House book series.&nbsp;Magic Tree House is a children’s fantasy book series which started in 1992, about two children who use a magic tree house to go on a series of quests throughout history (first for Morgan Le Fay, and then after book #29, for Merlin). The first movie to be adapted will indeed be that 29th book, Christmas in Camelot, which, as the title suggests, features King Arthur, Camelot, and the magic of Christmas. The author’s husband Will Osborne is adapting Christmas in Camelot with Chicago-based playwright Jenny Laird.7.&nbsp;HOLLYWOOD WILL NEED MORE THAN GUM AND A PAPERCLIP TO MAKE THE MACGYVER MOVIEThis was a big week for fans of the 1985-1992 ABC adventure TV series MacGyver. First, there was the news that CBS has ordered a new pilot for a MacGyver reboot series from producer/director James Wan, of the Saw and Insidious franchises. A few days later, it was revealed that Lionsgate is also developing a feature film adaptation of the show, which originally featured Richard Dean Anderson in the lead role. It’s not yet known if the MacGyver movie will use the same actor as the CBS TV series (which will cast the character as 10 years younger than Richard Dean Anderson was when the show started). We can speculate, however, that the two MacGyver reboots will be separate from each other, because right now, they have different producers. Lionsgate’s MacGyver is being coproduced by Neal Moritz, of the Fast and the Furious franchise. As&nbsp;with the Magic Tree House news above, Lionsgate’s movement on MacGyver is seen as a direct reaction to the studio’s recent disappointing quarterly results.Rotten Ideas of The Week2.&nbsp;MICHAEL PITT CAST AS THE LAUGHING MAN IN GHOST IN THE SHELLAs Hollywood and the moviegoing public at large continue to respond to #OscarsSoWhite, it has drawn renewed attention to the decades-long phenomenon known as “whitewashing.” You can see a list of roles where this has been done in the past (and recently) here, and see a video montage of some examples here. With some films, it can be more difficult to define whether or not the casting is whitewashing. Take, for example, DreamWorks’ live-action adaptation of the manga and anime cyberpunk epic Ghost in the Shell. Scarlett Johansson has been cast for over a year as the film’s lead, known in the original sources as Major Motoko Kusanagi. It’s unclear what Johansson’s character will be called in this new movie, so the role may not be Japanese (though arguably, that’s still a form of whitewashing). Anyway, the film is still getting made, with the news this week that Michael Pitt has been cast as “the villain” The Laughing Man. That’s also another problematic element, as it sounds like this movie might be changing who exactly is the film’s primary villain (the premise making no mention of The Puppet Master).&nbsp;Ghost in the Shell will be the second feature film from director Rupert Sanders (Snow White and the Huntsman).1. KEANU REEVES RACES TO CHINA IN RALLY CARChina’s influence on the box office continues to grow, with some movies doing better there than they do in the USA. One very relevant example of this was the 2014 racing/car movie Need for Speed, which earned $66 million in China, but only $43 million domestically. It’s arguably for that reason that this week’s most Rotten Idea is getting made. Keanu Reeves is attached to star in Rally Car, a racing movie to be produced and filmed in China later this year. Reeves (who is of partial Chinese descent) will play a former NASCAR champion who seeks “to prove he’s still the badass racer he thinks he is” by participating in a high-stakes international race across China, with a young Chinese girl as his co-driver.&nbsp;Rally Car will be directed by Harald Zwart, whose Tomatometer is the reason this is the week’s most Rotten Idea. Of the films Zwart is credited as director, only the 2010 remake of The Karate Kid (which also has a Chinese setting) has a Fresh score. Zwart’s other films are all hovering between 12 percent (Pink Panther 2 and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones) and 39 percent &nbsp;(Agent Cody Banks, the second time that movie was referenced in this Week’s Ketchup).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"caribbean, Apple, Red, psycho, winner","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/05165715/BanksRepulsa1.jpg","slug":"elizabeth-banks-joins-power-rangers-as-rita-repulsa-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509194727868","title":"Emily Blunt In Talks for Mary Poppins 2, Plus More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Emily Blunt In Talks for Mary Poppins 2, Plus More Movie NewsLaura Dern joins the next Star Wars movie, Julianne Moore is Kingsman's next villain, and the next Wolverine could be rated R.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 19, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as The Dark Tower, Kingsman 2, San Andreas 2, and Star Wars Episode VIII.This Week’s Top StoryEMILY BLUNT TO BE THE PERFECT NANNY IN MARY POPPINS 2When the news first broke last year that Walt Disney Pictures was planning on reviving the Mary Poppins franchise with a new sequel, the obvious question involved casting. Julie Andrews starred in Mary Poppins in 1964, but obviously a new actress would be required to reprise the character in a setting only 20 years after the first film. (Not only is Julie Andrews now 80, but she lost her singing voice following an operation in 1997.) Well, we now know who Disney hopes will fill Julie Andrews’ shoes (if a deal can be made), and the answer is… Emily Blunt!&nbsp;Although Blunt is perhaps best known for starring in action movies (Sicario, Edge of Tomorrow, Looper), she did recently work with Disney as The Baker’s Wife in Into the Woods. The sequel will reportedly draw storylines from multiple books that P.L. Travers wrote after the original Mary Poppins. The film will be set 20 years later, in the 1930s, as everyone’s favorite nanny returns to help the now grown up Michael Banks needs help with his own children. The Mary Poppins sequel will be directed by Rob Marshall, whose previous musicals include Chicago, Nine, and the aforementioned Into the Woods.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;JURASSIC PARK STAR LAURA DERN JOINS STAR WARS&nbsp;EPISODE VIIIWe’ve known for a while that Sin City and Guardians of the Galaxy costar Benicio Del Toro was going to add another franchise to his filmography as one of the villains (reportedly) in 2017’s Star Wars: Episode VIII. But this week, we found another star known for a major franchise, Jurassic Park, has also been cast in the movie. That’s because the official announcement of the start of filming revealed that Laura Dern has been cast in a new mystery role. The new characters played by Benicio Del Toro and Laura Dern will also be joined by newcomer Kelly Marie Tran, who appears to be playing the new young female character that such actresses as Olivia Cooke, Tatiana Maslany, and Gina Rodriguez were in the running to play. Dern, Del Toro, and Tran join the returning ensemble cast that includes John Boyega, Gwendoline Christie, Adam Driver, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, and Daisy Ridley. Star Wars: Episode VIII (or whatever it ends up being called) is currently being directed by Rian Johnson (Looper, The Brothers Bloom, Brick), and is scheduled for release on December 15, 2017.2.&nbsp;CHRISTIAN BALE TO STAR IN FRONTIER ADVENTURE/DRAMA HOSTILESLike many films, The Revenant had a long road through development, and along the way, there were other actors besides Leonardo DiCaprio that might have starred in it. In addition to Samuel L. Jackson (yes, really), Christian Bale was also attached to star in The Revenant for a while. Now, Bale is attached to star in another film which seems to share thematic and setting similarities with The Revenant. The project in question is called Hostiles, and like The Revenant, it is a 19th century (1892) drama about a harrowing journey through dangerous territory (New Mexico to Montana) controlled by a Native American tribe (the Comanches). Christian Bale will play “a legendary Army captain who agrees to escort a dying Cheyenne war chief and his family back to tribal lands.”&nbsp; Hostiles will be directed by Scott Cooper, whose latest film was Black Mass, starring Johnny Depp. Filming is expected to start on location in July, 2016, suggesting a possible awards season release in late 2017.3. JULIANNE MOORE MIGHT BE THE MAIN BIG BAD IN KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE SEQUELWhen Mark Millar’s The Secret Service comic was adapted as the movie Kingsman: The Secret Service, it was only “loosely adapted.” For the sequel, then, that means we really don’t know where the story might go next. What we do know is that Taron Egerton (Eddie the Eagle) will be back, and so will director Matthew Vaughn, but they won’t be joined by Colin Firth. In addition,&nbsp;the sequel will see Egerton’s British agent heading to the USA for his next espionage adventure. This week’s news doesn’t tell us more about the premise, except that the main villain will be a woman.&nbsp; And if her deal goes through, that villain will be played by Julianne Moore, who is probably looking for a new franchise, post-The Hunger Games. 20th Century Fox is expecting to start filming Kingsman 2 in May, aiming for a release date next summer on June 16, 2017.4. FAN SUPPORT MIGHT LEAD TO MOVIES FOR TV SHOWS HAPPY ENDINGS AND GOOD TIMESTwo concurrent trends converged this week on two different stories, in basically the same way. Those two trends are the growth of “crowdfunding” as a way for fans to support the movie projects they want to see happen, and also the way movies can find new life for fan favorite TV shows (such as with the crowdfunded Veronica Mars movie). Having said all that, our first story this week is actually a case of crowdfunding skipping the “crowd” altogether. That’s because Happy Endings star Casey Wilson revealed to Entertainment Tonight that an anonymous fan of Happy Endings wants to invest in a movie that will wrap up any lingering loose ends for the beloved-but-cancelled ABC ensemble comedy.&nbsp;Happy Endings only ran for two seasons from 2011 to 2013, until it was cancelled due to low ratings. However, the series has become something of a renewed social media sensation ever since Hulu started carrying the entire show. True crowdfunding is behind the other possible movie version of a beloved TV show, and it’s a lot older than Happy Endings. That’s because the original cast of the 1974-1979 sitcom Good Times have taken to Kickstarter to produce a new movie they’re calling The Original Good Times Cast Movie. The project is somewhat unusual, because this Good Times movie is starting outside participation from the show’s producers or copyrights owner (namely, Sony). The Kickstarter campaign has thus far not yet taken off, with only $7,000 of the $1,000,000 target currently reached (in other words, 0.7%).&nbsp; Although it’s unclear exactly what this movie will be, Jimmy Walker describes it in the campaign’s video as being a “docu-dramedy comedy.”5.&nbsp;“THE DAG” FROM MAD MAX: FURY ROAD LANDS FEMALE LEAD IN THE DARK TOWERAfter years of true “development hell,” it’s really starting to sound like Stephen King’s The Dark Tower books will finally be adapted as feature films. After hearing rumors and “wanted” type stories, this week’s casting news basically confirms two of the leads, which is in itself pretty major news. Let’s start there, which is that Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are both now signed for two of the saga’s major characters: Roland Deschain the Gunslinger (Elba) and the Man in Black, AKA Randall Flagg (McConaughey). This week’s news, however, gets a little confusing after that. Abbey Lee, who played “The Dag” (the most blonde “wife”) in Mad Max: Fury Road, has been cast as the first movie’s female lead, who is called Tirana. The reason this is confusing is that the character Tirana doesn’t show up in the novels until the seventh book, and even then, she’s a very minor character. Of course, characters in King’s Dark Tower books sometimes go by different names, so it’s possible that the character they’re calling Tirana is someone else entirely. The first movie based on King’s Dark Tower books will be directed by Nikolaj Arcel (A Royal Affair). And just as we’re hearing about further forward movement for one ambitious Stephen King adaptation, another seems to be going in the other direction. It was revealed this week that Warner Bros’ rights to make movies based on The Stand have reverted back to CBS Films. This probably explains why director Josh Boone is now working on another Stephen King adaptation, Revival, instead.Rotten Ideas of The Week4. $150 MILLION WEEKEND FOR DEADPOOL MIGHT MEAN MORE R-RATED SUPERHEROES, BUT IS THAT A GOOD THING?For most of his time as one of Marvel Comics’ most popular characters, Deadpool has been portrayed as dispatching bad guys in violent ways (or as violent as his particular comic would allow). It was for that reason that it wasn’t surprising that the Deadpool movie was R-rated. Many people found the idea of an R-rated superhero movie refreshing, at least partly because studios had long assumed a PG-13 rating would help ensure bigger box office returns. However, there have been R-rated superhero movies before, such as the three Blade movies, the three Punisher movies, the two Judge Dredd movies, the two Kick-Ass movies, and Watchmen. In addition to being R-rated, however, something else that a lot of these movies have in common are Rotten Tomatometer scores. Some examples we can give you are Blade: Trinity (25%), Judge Dredd (18%), and Kick-Ass 2 (30%). So, it’s not necessarily welcome news that the success of Deadpool might mean more R-rated superhero movies. The most official news this week of an impending R-rated superhero movie is next year’s Wolverine III (title pending, 3/3/17), if the source you can find here moves past “anticipated” to receiving an official R rating from the MPAA. 20th Century Fox may also have R-rated plans for Deadpool’s super team friends X-Force, and of course, when Cable joins Deadpool in their sequel, that film will also be R-rated. Finally, Todd McFarlane also mentioned this week that he hopes for a new Spawn movie to now get a green light, and an R rating as well.3.&nbsp;RYAN REYNOLDS MAY JOIN MISSION TO MARS FOR LIFEAs so often happens (and arguably should), the huge box office success of Deadpool is already leading to new deals for the film’s star. We’re speaking, of course, about Ryan Reynolds, who is now in talks to star in a science fiction movie&nbsp;called Life. If he signs on, Reynolds would be joining Rebecca Ferguson, who shot to fame in the USA last year as the female lead in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.&nbsp;Life is described as a “big scale film” about a Mars mission which encounters some form of intelligent alien life. The film is a reunion for Ryan Reynolds in two ways, as Life will be directed by Daniel Espinosa (who directed Reynolds in Safe House), and was written by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, who also wrote Deadpool.&nbsp;Life is being produced by Skydance Productions, the same Paramount-based company behind such upcoming films as Star Trek: Beyond, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (both in 2016), and Geostorm and World War Z 2 (both scheduled for 2017). Daniel Espinosa currently only has one Fresh score out of the three film he has on his Tomatometer as director, which is why we’re calling Life one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.2.&nbsp;PAUL RUDD AND STEVE COOGAN TO SHARE AN IDEAL HOMENow that he’s firmly a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe after Ant-Man, one might expect that Paul Rudd will be needing to set aside a lot of his schedule to appear in movies like Captain America: Civil War. Rudd is, however, still signing on for other movies. The latest is An Ideal Home, a dramedy in which Rudd and Steve Coogan will star as a gay married couple. Coogan will play a “demanding, popular celebrity,” and Rudd will play “his more hesitant partner and sidekick.” The film’s story will revolve around a grandson Coogan’s character didn’t know about, who shows up one night at “their fancy dinner party with nowhere else to go, [and] the couple reluctantly takes him in.”&nbsp;An Ideal Home was written and will be directed by Andrew Fleming, with whom Steve Coogan previously worked on Hamlet 2. Only two of Fleming’s eight feature films as director have received a Fresh Tomatometer score, which is why we’re calling this story one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.1.&nbsp;SAN ANDREAS SEQUEL TO SHAKE UP DWAYNE JOHNSON’S WORLD AGAINAfter earning over $473 million globally last year, the earthquake disaster movie San Andreas is set to get a sequel. New Line Cinema is now moving forward with exactly that plan, and the studio expects Dwayne Johnson to return as his pilot character again. This time around, the focus may be moving to the area called “The Ring of Fire” (is that the possible subtitle right there?), which is a band of volcanos and earthquake hotspots around the Pacific Islands. In addition to Johnson, New Line Cinema also hopes that his costars Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario, and Paul Giamatti will also return for the sequel. Whatever San Andreas 2 is called or is about, the sequel will also see the return of Brad Peyton, whose three films to date have all received Rotten Tomatometer scores (50% for San Andreas, 42% for Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, and 14% for Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"theme, television, VOD, rom-coms, based, VH1, IFC, HBO, venice, 71st, boxing","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/19131953/MaryPoppinsBlunt.jpg","slug":"emily-blunt-in-talks-for-mary-poppins-2-plus-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509196290499","title":"The 12 Most Rotten Hollywood Headlines of 2015","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 12 Most Rotten Hollywood Headlines of 2015We look back at the most disappointing stories of the year.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 31, 2015 |  CommentsFew industries enjoy taking really, really, really long extended holiday vacations quite like Hollywood. So when we get to this time of the year, there’s really not much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss, especially not in a weekly column which normally includes 10 different stories. So, last week, we instead reviewed 12 of the year’s top “Fresh Development” stories,&nbsp;and this week, we’re looking at 10 of the year’s most Rotten Ideas.&nbsp; For this batch, we’re not sticking with a strict one-per-month list, so as not to penalize movies for when their bad news broke. Our retrospective begins with one of the year’s biggest stories, which sort of epitomizes what makes a “Rotten Idea” story…rotten idea&nbsp;Of the yearCAN WE ALL AGREE TO FORGET THE PLANS FOR A MEMENTO REMAKE?A popular approach to the idea of film remakes is that it’s an endeavor&nbsp;best undertaken for films that were flawed the first time around, which suggests that “perfect” films would never have a reason to get the remake treatment. So, when movie&nbsp;fans hear about a favorite film in development as a remake or a reboot (or a re-whatever), they are quickly and vocally unhappy. Such was the case in November with the announcement that a new production company called AMBI Pictures has acquired the rights to several independent films, including Christopher Nolan’s 2000 film, Memento, which they plan to remake. Guy Pearce starred in Memento as a man with only very limited memory of his past, so that he has tattooed himself with information and clues, as he drifts through an existence where he is extremely open to manipulation and deception by those around him. Here’s how AMBI’s Andrea Iervolino addressed their plans to remake Memento, “[which] has been consistently ranked as one of the best films of its decade. People who’ve seen Memento 10 times still feel they need to see it one more time. This is a quality we feel really supports and justifies a remake. The bar is set high thanks to the brilliance or [sic] Christopher Nolan, but we wouldn’t want it any other way.” So, the question gets asked once again: Is it worth trying to remake what so many consider a perfect film?JANUARY: YOU CAN’T ESCAPE FROM THE ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK REMAKEIn the last ten or so years when Hollywood was particularly addicted to genre remakes, one of the projects that just wouldn’t go away was the Escape from New York remake. In January, there was a bidding war between various studios, and 20th Century Fox won the bid, with John Carpenter attached to executive produce. You can probably disregard most of what you’ve heard in the past, because a “start from scratch” approach is being touted. Having said that, some of the previous rumors or discussions might still happen (you never know). Recent rumored stars to be the new Snake Plissken have included Charlie Hunnam (Pacific Rim) and Chris Hemsworth (Marvel’s Thor). The Escape from New York remake now needs to find a director, and they don’t even have the help of a beacon. We’re calling this one a “Rotten Idea” just because if there’s any John Carpenter film that still holds up without a remake, it’s The Thing ( and look at what happened there). If there’s a second one, it’s Escape from New York. Can anyone beat Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken? Or beat Kurt Russell as Jack Burton in Big Trouble in Little China (though apparently Dwayne Johnson will try?FEBRUARY: FIFTY SHADES OF GREY TRILOGY IS MOVING FORWARD, BECAUSE OF COURSE IT ISRotten Tomatoes is a site dedicated to providing a gauge of critical reactions to various movies and TV shows (you know that, right?). Unfortunately, it is not critical opinion that is used to make decisions in Hollywood. So this story should not have come as any sort of surprise. Universal Pictures&nbsp; officially confirmed plans to adapt E.L. James’ sequel novels Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed as feature films, presumably with the same stars, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson. As of this writing, Fifty Shades of Grey has a Tomatometer score of 24 percent. Later in the spring, two more films with Rotten Tomatometer scores received sequels as well. First, there was Need for Speed (with a sequel reportedly mandated mostly because of the film’s success in China )., and then in May, we also heard about a sequel to Project X called Project XX, and there, the mandate was probably due to how cheaply 20-somethings can be filmed (acting) drunk.APRIL: REMAKES FOR MONSTER CLASSICS GREMLINS, THE BLOB, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOONSome movies take so long to get made that they can actually predate movies from the 1990s that are themselves in development to get remade again (specifically, we’re thinking of The Mummy). Another monster movie classic that has been in varying degrees of development is The Creature from the Black Lagoon. That remake actually dates all the way back to the early 1980s, when then-red-hot John Landis was hoping to produce a version directed by Jack Arnold, who directed the original 1954 movie. The Black Lagoon remake has taken various forms in the 30+ years since (really far more than we can detail here), but in April, the Black Lagoon remake “surfaced” again with a rumor that Scarlett Johansson had been offered the lead role (as a scientist, not the Creature, though that could be on this side of awesome). If this movie ever does finally happen, it will be part of Universal’s struggling (following the disappointing 23 percent Rotten bestowed upon Dracula Untold) plans for reboots of their “Classic Universal Monsters.” In similar territory that same week, we learned that Warner Bros is still pursuing plans for a Gremlins remake, and that remake specialist screenwriter Carl Ellsworth has been hired to work on precisely that. Ellsworth’s previous credits&nbsp;include&nbsp;Red Dawn and The Last House on the Left.&nbsp; There was also news in January about plans for another remake of The Blob, except as more of an “action movie.”MAY:&nbsp;AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS MAE WHITMAN REPLACED IN INDEPENDENCE DAY 2Throughout the weeks of casting news for the sequel to Independence Day in early 2015, one would have guessed that one of the easiest roles for 20th Century Fox to cast would be the President’s daughter, Patricia Whitmore. The reason for this is that the child actor, Mae Whitman, who played the character in the 1996 hit movie, has grown up to become the prolific, critically adored, and award-winning star of such movies as The DUFF, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and Scott Pilgrim vs the World. Instead, in May, 20th Century Fox cast Maika Monroe, the star of the horror hit It Follows, to play President Bill Pullman’s daughter in the sequel. As E! Online pointed out, Whitman hadn’t even been on 20th Century Fox’s shortlist of actresses in the running for the role. The reactions online were quick and polarizing (not surprising since It Follows has been very popular), with the pro-Mae Whitman camp arguably led by Pitch Perfect star Anna Kendrick,&nbsp;who&nbsp;sent out a Tweet saying, “What the actual f***? @maebirdwing is talented as hell, and JUST proved she can carry a film. Smh.” Buzzfeed came out against the snubbing of Mae Whitman as well. 20th Century Fox has scheduled Independence Day: Resurgence for release on June 24, 2016.MAY:&nbsp;WARNER BROS LOOKING TO REMAKE/SEQUELIZE&nbsp;THE FUGITIVEA growing trend within Hollywood’s film development movers and shakers is the regurgitation and/or revisitation of Harrison Ford’s earlier film career. Ford himself has&nbsp;revisited his role for Star Wars: The Force Awakens and will do the same for&nbsp;Blade Runner 2 (presumably Deckard is who Ford’s playing, at least), and for a while, there were rumors about Chris Pratt taking over the Indiana Jones franchise. &nbsp;In May, we were able to add The Fugitive (which was itself an adaptation of a popular 1960s TV series) to the mix, as Warner Bros has put a new Fugitive movie into development. There’s still a lot that we don’t know, however, such as whether the new movie will be a remake or a sequel. Whatever it is, Warner Bros has hired not-yet-produced screenwriter Christina Hodson to work on the screenplay. Although the 1993 movie starring Harrison Ford is Certified Fresh at 93 percent, the 1997 attempt to spinoff the franchise focusing on Tommy Lee Jones’ character, U.S. Marshals, is decidedly not, with a Rotten score of just 27 percent. Another classic film that received news of remake development (in October) was the 1962 John Wayne/James Stewart western The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.JUNE:&nbsp;THE PLAN FOR BAD BOYS 3 (AND BAD BOYS 4) IS COMING TOGETHER, VIA A-TEAM DIRECTORIt has now been twelve years since the 2003 release of Bad Boys II (and 20 years and a few months since the first Bad Boys in May, 1995). For most of those twelve years, someone at Sony has been trying to get a third Bad Boys buddy cop sequel greenlit for production. In June, we learned that the possibility of seeing a third movie pairing Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is still viable, with the news that a new screenwriter is now in talks. The writer in question is writer-director Joe Carnahan, whose filmography includes 2010’s The A-Team, as well as The Grey, Narc, and Smokin’ Aces. Carnahan is also the writer-director who spent time a few years ago at 20th Century Fox working on a 1970s-set Daredevil movie before the rights eventually reverted back to Marvel, resulting in the recent Netflix series. Joe Carnahan’s Tomatometer has both Fresh and Rotten scores fairly evenly, but we’re calling this one a “Rotten Idea” for one reason: Neither of the first two Bad Boys movies earned a Tomatometer score higher than 43 percent. Then, in August, we learned that Sony is planning on not just Bad Boys 3 (2/17/17), but also a&nbsp;Bad Boys 4 (7/3/19).&nbsp; (Joe Carnahan’s involvement in either is not yet confirmed.)JULY: 2015 IS A BANNER YEAR FOR NON-NARRATIVE DEALS: EMOJI,&nbsp;PEZ,&nbsp;HELLO KITTY,&nbsp;PLAY-DOHThe success last year of The LEGO Movie has inspired a few non-narrative movie projects to follow in its wake, including Play-Doh (announced in April), Hello Kitty (announced in July), various other LEGO sequels and spinoffs, and Minecraft. One of the most surprising projects (depending upon your cynicism) that can be compared to The LEGO Movie happened in July. After a high-pitched bidding war, Sony Pictures Animation won, in a deal worth nearly $10 million, the feature film rights to the Emoji. Formerly popularly called “Smileys,” Emoji are the increasingly varied faces, usually yellow, that one finds available on smart phones, message chat, and other electronic forms of communication. Somewhat bizarrely for a deal that ended up with such a large scale, Emoji does not itself directly involve any sorts of rights, but the money was spent regardless. Like The LEGO Movie, those little “Emoji” icons do not have any pre-existing narrative structure on which to base a movie, which could be seen as a weakness in structuring the story, but it’s also potentially the grounds for wide open creativity for the writers Sony Pictures Animation hires to adapt the film. And those writers will be Eric Siegel, one of the producers of Men at Work, and Anthony Leondis, who wrote and directed the 2008 animated film Igor, and cowrote and codirected the direct-to-video sequel Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch. There was also news in August about a similar deal for the Pez candy dispenser franchise. Sony Pictures has not yet set a release date for their Emoji movie. :O 😉 🙂AUGUST: LEBRON JAMES CONFIRMS PLANS FOR SPACE JAM 2When Warner Bros released Looney Tunes: Back in Action in late 2003, it was considered a box office bomb. That movie’s financial failure presumably led to the 12-year absence of any live action/animated Looney Tunes movies. What the box office numbers don’t tell you, however, is that critically, Looney Tunes: Back in Action (57 percent Tomatometer) was actually better received than Space Jam (36 percent Tomatometer), the 1996 Looney Tunes basketball comedy (though both scores are Rotten overall). Regardless, there have been rumors the last few years that Warner Bros is developing a sequel to Space Jam (presumably because it&nbsp;earned $230 million globally despite its&nbsp;critical reception). The focus of those rumors has been on Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James, but until August, there had been no confirmation (including even when his production company signed with WB last month). Avoiding the Hollywood trades and blogs that are usually the sources for such news, LeBron James instead went on NBC’s Today to say this about Space Jam 2: “We hope so. We’re definitely missing Bugs and Daffy and Tasmanian Devil and every last one of them, so hopefully we can do some great things.” LeBron James made his feature film acting debut in last month’s Trainwreck, appearing alongside Amy Schumer. There’s no word yet what other NBA stars might join James in Space Jam 2.OCTOBER: YIPPIE-KI-YAY, FLASHBACKER! DIE HARD: YEAR ONE IN THE WORKSHere in the United States, the 2013 sequel A Good Day to Die Hard is commonly perceived as a box office bomb, with the five-film franchise’s lowest domestic box office ($67 million), and scathing reviews. However, a look at the worldwide box office total tells a different story, as it was the third Die Hard film in a row to earn over $300 million (and only $79 million behind the franchise’s top earning film, Live Free or Die Hard). So, there still appears to be a financial incentive for 20th Century Fox to keep making Die Hard movies. However, Bruce Willis also turned 60 this year, which means he can’t be starring as John McClane for much longer. An attempt was made with A Good Day to Die Hard to set up a franchise hand-off to McClane’s son, played by Jai Courtney. In October, we learned that 20th Century Fox is now developing a sixth film which will attempt another way of continuing the franchise&nbsp;without Willis filming the action. That approach will be a prequel currently called Die Hard: Year One, and will tell the story of young police officer John McClane on the “gritty” streets of 1979 New York City, where he learned how to be so “die hard.” Although the bulk of the story will be set in 1979, with John McClane played by a new actor, Bruce Willis is expected to also costar, providing “book end” scenes set in the modern day to lead into the flashbacks. 20th Century Fox is teaming with producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Live Free or Die Hard director Len Wiseman, who also directed Underworld, Underworld: Evolution, and the 2012 remake of Total Recall. Although the fourth Die Hard was Certified Fresh, it was also the only film of the six on Len Wiseman’s Tomatometer not to receive a Rotten score.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"target","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31095409/EmojiKetchup.jpg","slug":"the-12-most-rotten-hollywood-headlines-of-2015"},{"id":"47509196299720","title":"Angelina Jolie Sought for Bride of Frankenstein Remake, and More Hollywood Headlines","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Angelina Jolie Sought for Bride of Frankenstein Remake, and More Hollywood HeadlinesTom Cruise may star in the next Mummy movie, Ryan Gosling could play Neil Armstrong, and Fantastic Four 2 gets canned.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 27, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers the week this year leading up to Thanksgiving, as the Hollywood folks who provide us with our glimpses into film development each week are frequently taking early holiday vacations.&nbsp; Even so, there were still several major movie news stories this week. Included in the mix are stories about such films as Bride of Frankenstein, The Mummy, Murder on the Orient Express, and the Neil Armstrong biopic First Man.This Week’s Top StoryANGELINA JOLIE WANTED FOR BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN REMAKESometimes fairly major casting or development revelations are in stories that are basically “burying the lead.”&nbsp; This week, it happened with a story about the down sides of the “one for me, one for them” relationship between many stars and their studios which leads to films like By the Sea (Brad Pitt and Angelina Pitt Jolie) or Our Brand is Crisis (Sandra Bullock) being box office flops for their studios. The reasoning is that the studios back pet projects for major stars so that they will then sign on to the more obvious box office draw films that the studio wants them to star in. That story then led to the mention that Universal Pictures hopes Angelina Jolie Pitt will sign on to star in their remake of Bride of Frankenstein, and that part right there was one of this week’s biggest new developments. (The story also mentioned Universal’s interest in AJP starring in Wanted 2, but that’s been commonly known since 2008). It has been known for years that Universal Pictures wants to develop a “cinematic universe” for new remakes of their various “Universal Monsters” (such as The Mummy, Dracula, The Invisible Man, The Wolfman, etc). It’s not yet known which director might take on Bride of Frankenstein, but Guillermo Del Toro did tell us (RT) a few years ago that it’s one of his Five Favorite Films, and he’s worked with Universal Pictures in the past (Crimson Peak, Hellboy II: The Golden Army). That Universal Pictures is working on Bride of Frankenstein (but not necessarily, immediately, a Frankenstein movie) seems to gel with recent reports that The Mummy may also be female. If both pan out, with at least two of the Universal Monsters, the studio may be including more female characters. And those aren’t the only possibilities; could Universal maybe deliver a Wives of Dracula movie, or a female Creature from the Black Lagoon?Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;KENNETH BRANAGH TO INVESTIGATE MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS AS HERCULE POIROT20th Century Fox confirmed this week that director Kenneth Branagh&nbsp;(Hamlet, Thor) will indeed follow up his 2015 hit Cinderella with their adaptation of Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express (11/10/17).&nbsp; That news also comes with the revelation that Kenneth Branagh will also be starring in the film in addition to directing. And the character that Branagh’s taking on is one of Agatha Christie’s most famous characters, the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Poirot has appeared in 33 novels, played on film by such actors as Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov, and Tony Randall, and for 24 years (1989-2013), in the British TV series as played by David Suchet. This new adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express is being adapted by screenwriter Michael Green, who has also worked on such upcoming films as the Blade Runner sequel, the third Wolverine solo film, and Ridley Scott’s Alien: Covenant. If Murder on the Orient Express proves to be a hit in late 2017, 20th Century Fox may also follow it up with other Hercule Poirot films.2.&nbsp;THE RACE TOWARDS AN EVEL KNIEVEL BIOPIC… NOW MIGHT INCLUDE MARTIN SCORSESE?Along with Janis Joplin, the idea of an Evel Knievel biopic has been drifting through film development since at least the late 1990s (starting with a project called Pure Evel which Matthew McConaughey was once considering). Evel Knievel (1938-2007) was of course the daredevil motorcycle stuntman who became something of a pop culture sensation in the 1970s, going on to even have his own line of popular toys and action figures. Recently, there had been news about a possible Evel Knievel biopic featuring Channing Tatum and directed by Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Noah, Black Swan), who chose a Jennifer Lawrence project as his next instead. Hollywood producers and executives sometimes can’t resist the lure of a challenge, and so we often get into situations of “dueling movies,” where different people try to make the same movie at the same time (such as the Snow White movies of 2012). And now, that appears to be happening with the Evel Knievel biopic. Paramount Pictures is also developing their own film, adapted from the book Evel Knievel on Tour, by Sheldon Saltman, which focused on Knievel’s failed attempt at jumping over the Snake River (using a rocket!) in 1974.&nbsp; Paramount has hired screenwriter William Monahan (Kingdom of Heaven, Body of Lies) to adapt Saltman’s book. The studio’s hope is that Monahan’s script can attract the interest of director Martin Scorsese, who has worked with Monahan before on The Departed. If Scorsese does indeed sign on to direct this film, the list of possible Knievels is lengthy, but Leonardo DiCaprio would probably be the first choice, considering his star power, and his long list of collaborations with Martin Scorsese (five to date, with The Devil in the White City expected to be #6… or #7 if this movie happens first).3. WILL RYAN GOSLING TAKE ONE SMALL STEP IN THE NEIL ARMSTRONG BIOPIC?There are now less than four years remaining until the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon mission (July 20, 2019, to be precise, which is a Saturday). That means that there is still time for Universal Pictures to prepare First Man, their planned biopic of Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong, who is famously quoted as saying, “one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind” on that day as he became the first human being to walk on the Moon. For First Man, Universal is combining the efforts of three individuals whose careers are on the upswing. The book First Man: A Life of Neil A. Armstrong (by James Hansen) is beind adapted by screenwriter Josh Singer, who wrote The Fifth Estate, and this fall’s Spotlight (both are true story dramas). Director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) is already attached, and Universal is hoping to cast Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong. Gosling and Chazelle are currently working together on the musical La La Land, scheduled for July 15, 2016.4.&nbsp;GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 DIRECTOR JAMES GUNN SHOOTS DOWN STAR-LORD RUMORSetting up the sequel, one of the final scenes in Guardians of the Galaxy addressed the mystery of the identity of the father of Star-Lord (AKA Chris Pratt). Over the last year, fans have speculated at length about who exactly it will be (since director James Gunn has made it clear that it won’t be the same character as in the comics, J’son of Spartax). On Tuesday, a rumor appeared online&nbsp;that Star-Lord’s father will be Mar-Vell, AKA Marvel’s original Captain Marvel, before the title was passed to Carol Danvers. (Captain Marvel is already known to be getting her own movie, currently scheduled for March 8, 2019). That story was only online for about two hours before James Gunn took to his Facebook page to officially debunk it. Specifically, James Gunn wrote, “That said, the rumors surrounding Quill’s parentage at the present moment are completely false, and aren’t even close to the truth. I don’t know how people come up with this stuff, but it certainly isn’t through legitimate sources.” Gunn goes on to rebuke the tendency these days for writers, journalists, and fans, to seek out every detail about a high-profile genre film months or years before release, saying, “I got in this business because I love movies, and I think most film journalists are the same way. And spoiling plot details doesn’t add to the enjoyment of the film-going experience. So bravo to those folks out there who don’t partake in this sort of thing.” If the lid can indeed be kept on the mystery of Star-Lord’s parentage, fans will still have lots of possible suspects to consider. The list of potential dads for Star-Lord includes Adam Warlock, The Collector, Starfox, Starhawk, Thanos, or Yondu, plus plenty of Marvel’s other cosmic characters. We’ll find out when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is released on May 5, 2017.5.&nbsp;20TH CENTURY FOX UNSURPRISINGLY REMOVES FANTASTIC FOUR 2 FROM ITS SCHEDULEIn what might be the sort of non-news that happens as most of Hollywood is out of town pre-Thanksgiving, there’s this little bit of film schedule shifting. What particularly makes this a possible “this-is-news?” story is that some people might have thought this happened already. We’re speaking here of the notion of 20th Century Fox seriously planning a sequel to this past summer’s phenomenally disastrous flop, Fantastic Four. The film’s Tomatometer score has now “risen” to 10 percent, but that’s still really, really, low (and for Top Critics, the score is only 5 percent!). Even so, 20th Century Fox had kept Fantastic Four 2 on their schedule for June 9, 2017, but as of this week, the film has been completely removed from their schedule. Movies are frequently moved around on the schedule, or shifted back to TBA dates like “Summer 2017” or “TBA 2018,” but removals are less common. Although 20th Century Fox may be giving up on another Fantastic Four, that doesn’t automatically mean that the film rights to the characters will revert back to Marvel (as many fans might hope). Instead, the possibility is still out there that 20th Century Fox could still introduce them, with the same actors or recastings, in any of their upcoming X-Men franchise films. Since this is ostensibly news about a potentially Rotten movie not being produced, we’re calling this a “Fresh Development.”Rotten IdeaS of The Week2. TOM CRUISE MAY STAR IN THE (NEXT) REMAKE OF THE MUMMYUniversal Pictures has been known to be working on a new “cinematic universe” tying together all of their Universal Monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolfman, The Invisible Man, etc.) for quite some time (pretty much since it worked for Marvel). The first movie in that new franchise will be The Mummy, which is already scheduled for March 24, 2017, and will start filming in just three months (February, 2016). What has been missing until this week is a star for The Mummy, and Universal was reportedly searching for a very major star for exactly that role. The answer appears to be Tom Cruise, whom multiple sources* report &nbsp;is now in talks to star&nbsp;in Universal’s next remake of The Mummy. This version will be set in the present day (unlike the Brendan Fraser movies). It’s unknown which character Tom Cruise will play, but news that The Mummy may be female in this film suggests that Cruise may be playing one of the non-immortal humans who discovers The Mummy (or something like that). The Mummy will be directed by screenwriter Alex Kurtzman (cowriter of Star Trek, Transformers), who made his directorial debut with 2012’s People Like Us. This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based on the number of Rotten scores on Alex Kurtzman’s Tomatometer, not specifically because of Tom Cruise’s possible involvement.&nbsp; (* We should also note that Deadline is reporting that “no deal with Cruise is in the works” for The Mummy, though they don’t address which star might take the role if Cruise doesn’t.)1.&nbsp;NEW DETAILS OF THE DELAYED/SCRAPPED ALIEN 5… STARRING A GROWN UP NEWT?Director Neill Blomkamp (Chappie, District 9) is moving on from his plans for Alien 5, as Ridley Scott prepares for his Prometheus sequel and Alien prequel, now called Alien: Covenant (10/6/17). As that happens, we are now learning more details about what Blomkamp’s film would have involved. Our information this week is coming from actor Michael Biehn, who, along with Newt, appeared to have died in Alien 3 (sorry for the 23 year old spoiler!). In something of an alternate reality pickup, Blomkamp’s film would have been a direct sequel to Aliens, and disregarded the events of both Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. Instead, both Hicks and Newt are still alive (though there is a precedent for this, as Hicks is depicted as surviving Alien 3 in various Alien videogames). One reason for these changes is that the franchise focus would then switch from the obviously aging Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) to a 27-year-old Newt, to be played by a young new female actress. Michael Biehn seems to believe that this Alien 5 will still happen at some point after Alien: Covenant. Although the two Alien movies that this plan “retcons” out of existence both received Rotten Tomatometer scores (44 percent for Alien 3 and 54% for Alien: Resurrection), this approach still seems problematic. We can’t help but remember the last time a 1980s sci-fi franchise involving Michael Biehn tried to rewrite continuity, because it wasn’t that long ago.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Box, CW, Broadway, Seed, renewed, Ovation, Moore, foreign, Alien, trailers, SDCC, Starz, movies, criterion, talk","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/25152045/AngelinaJolieBrideFrankenst.jpg","slug":"angelina-jolie-sought-for-bride-of-frankenstein-remake-and-more-hollywood-headlines"},{"id":"47509196302794","title":"Johnny Depp Will Lend His Voice To Sherlock Gnomes, and More Hollywood Headlines","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Johnny Depp Will Lend His Voice To Sherlock Gnomes, and More Hollywood HeadlinesTracy Morgan joins the Richard Pryor biopic, Cate Blanchett teams up with Richard Linklater, and \"Gamergate\" will be adapted.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 13, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers ten headlines from the realm of film development news from the last seven days. Included in the mix this time around are stories about such movies as The LEGO Batman Movie, The Little Mermaid, Sherlock Gnomes, Toy Story 4, and the Richard Pryor biopic.This Week’s Top StoryJOHNNY DEPP TO STAR AS ANIMATED DETECTIVE SHERLOCK GNOMESWhen the animated musical Gnomeo and Juliet was something of a surprise box office hit ($194 million on a budget of $36 million) in 2011, a sequel was quickly announced. Animated movies do however take a while to produce, and so we’re still a few years away from that movie’s release, which is now scheduled for January 12, 2018 (MLK weekend). This week, however, we did learn more about the sequel, which will be called Sherlock Gnomes, as the title character investigates a series of garden gnome disappearances around London. Sherlock himself will be voiced by Johnny Depp, who will make his return to animation, after last providing the voice of the lead character in another 2011 animated movie, Rango.&nbsp;Sherlock Gnomes will be directed by John Stevenson, who previously codirected DreamWorks’ 2008 hit Kung Fu Panda. Elton John, who provided several songs for the first Gnomeo &amp; Juliet soundtrack, will be one of the producers of Sherlock Gnomes, though it’s unknown what his musical contributions will be.&nbsp;Sherlock Gnomes will be distributed by Paramount Pictures, and the studio also announced dates for some other animated movies this week. The sequel SpongeBob Squarepants 3 is now scheduled for February 8, 2019, and the original film Amusement Park is scheduled for March 22, 2019. The voice cast of Amusement Park will include Matthew Broderick, Jennifer Garner, Ken Jeong, Mila Kunis, John Oliver, Jeffrey Tambor, and Kenan Thompson. Details are being kept tight right now, but it’s a pretty good guess that Amusement Park probably takes place at an amusement park.Fresh Developments This Week1. TRACY MORGAN’S RETURN CONTINUES AS REDD FOXX IN THE RICHARD PRYOR BIOPICComedian Tracy Morgan is continuing his rehabilitation and return to acting following his horrible 2014 car accident. Tracy Morgan recently hosted Saturday Night Live, and will also costar in the comedy Fist Fight with Ice Cube and Charlie Day. For his next project, Tracy Morgan is in talks to take on the role of comedy great Redd Foxx. If a deal can be made, Tracy Morgan will costar in Lee Daniels’ untitled biopic of comedian Richard Pryor as one of Pryor’s mentors, Redd Foxx. Specifically, Redd Foxx will be portrayed (pre-Sanford and Son) as “a brash comedian who owned a local comedy club and encouraged Pryor to open up in his act and embrace his culture.” Richard Pryor will be played by Mike Epps, and will be joined by Kate Hudson (as his wife, Jennifer Pryor), Oprah Winfrey (as his grandmother), Taraji P. Henson and Eddie Murphy (as his parents). It’s not yet known if Eddie Murphy, who was also a friend of Richard Pryor’s as a young comedian, will also be a character in the movie.2. CATE BLANCHETT IN TALKS FOR RICHARD LINKLATER’S WHERE’D YOU GO BERNADETTEFollowing last year’s success with Boyhood, the year 2015 has seen much anticipation about which film director Richard Linklater will do as his follow-up. For a while, it had seemed like Richard Linklater would be working with Jennifer Lawrence on a romantic comedy called The Rosie Project, but then both Lawrence and Linklater left that project. It didn’t take long for Linklater to find a new job, working on an adaptation of the 2012 best seller novel Where’d You Go, Bernadette?&nbsp;by author Maria Semple. Cate Blanchett is now in talks to star as the title character, “an agoraphobic architect and mother named Bernadette Branch who goes missing prior to a family trip to Antarctica.” The book is narrated by her 15-year-old daughter who leads the search to find her mother.3.&nbsp;MARIAH CAREY ELECTED AS MAYOR OF GOTHAM CITY IN THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE(Photo by Ethan Miller / Staff / Getty Images)&nbsp;There was something of a miscommunication online this week, leading to reports that pop singer Mariah Carey had been cast as Commissioner Jim Gordon in The LEGO Batman Movie (crazier things have happened). It turns out that Carey will indeed costar in this LEGO Movie spinoff, but it won’t be as such a famously male character. Instead, she will provide her voice as the Mayor of Gotham City, not its police commissioner; it’s not yet known if she will also be singing in the movie. Mariah Carey joins the previously cast Will Arnett (Batman), Rosario Dawson (Batgirl), Michael Cera (Robin), Zach Galifianakis (The Joker), and Ralph Fiennes (Alfred). Warner Bros has scheduled The LEGO Batman Movie for February 10, 2017.4.&nbsp;PATRICIA ARQUETTE TO VOICE “HIPPIE” MOM IN TOY STORY 4We’ve known for a while now that Pixar and Disney had scheduled a fourth Toy Story for June 15, 2018. That initial announcement came with confirmation that Tim Allen and Tom Hanks will reprise their roles as Buzz Lightyear and Woody. And when the premise was revealed to be about a romance between Woody and Bo Beep, Annie Potts was announced as well. This week, we learned about a new character for Toy Story 4, and it’s going to be a major human character. Patricia Arquette (Boyhood, True Romance) will provide the voice of “a laid-back mom who’s described as a hippie.”&nbsp;Toy Story 4 will be directed by John Lasseter from a script by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack.5. REESE WITHERSPOON AND SCARLETT JOHANSSON JOIN ANIMATED MUSICAL SINGEarlier this years, the news broke that Matthew McConaughey would be starring in an untitled animated musical from Illumination Entertainment, the company behind the Despicable Me franchise, Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax, and next summer’s The Secret Life of Pets. This week saw the release of character images for the musical, which will be called simply Sing, along with lots of new cast names and character descriptions.&nbsp;Sing will be set in a world of animals (much like Disney’s upcoming Zootopia), and follow the struggles of theater owner Buster the koala (Matthew McConaughey). In an attempt to revive his theater, Buster holds a musical competition, with five strong competitors emerging: a mouse (Seth McFarlane), an elephant (Tori Kelly), a mother pig (Reese Witherspoon), a “gangster” gorilla (Taron Egerton), and a punk rock porcupine (Scarlett Johansson). Other characters will be voiced by Beck Bennett, Leslie Jones, Nick Kroll, Nick Offerman, Jay Pharoah, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Saunders, and Peter Serafinowicz. Sing will feature over 85 songs, and wil be directed by Garth Jennings (Son of Rambow, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy). Universal Pictures has scheduled Sing for December 21, 2016.6. CHLOE GRACE MORETZ CONFIRMED TO STAR AS LIVE-ACTION THE LITTLE MERMAIDIn addition to the live action adaptations of fairy tales that Walt Disney Pictures has been making recently, there are also similar projects at other studios. Universal Pictures released Snow White and the Huntsman in 2012, and has also been developing a live action version of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid. (It should be noted that Disney has not yet announced plans for their own live action version of their 1989 animated movie.) Universal and Working Title’s version of The Little Mermaid seemed to hit a major snag earlier this year when director Sofia Coppola left the project. But now we know that the movie is still in the works. Working Title has hired screenwriter Richard Curtis, who has also directed the movies Love Actually, Pirate Radio, and About Time) to work on a new adaptation draft, though he may not direct. Chloë Grace Moretz, who had been rumored for the title character when Coppola was involved, has now been confirmed for the role. (There are rumors that the casting of Moretz may have been an issue behind the departure of Coppola, who may have wanted a less famous actress.)7. FORMER SONY EXEC AMY PASCAL TO TAKE ON GAMERGATE WITH CRASH OVERRIDEIt’s long been something of a recurring joke that video gaming is the domain of a certain type of male (though statistics do not support that meme). The issue of gender in the video game industry took a dark turn in the last year during a series of events that has become known as “Gamergate.” It all started when the ex-boyfriend of video game developer Zoë Quinn wrote a negative blog about her, leading to Quinn being the target of harassment and threats (including rape and death). Zoë Quinn related her experiences in an upcoming memoir called “Crash Override: How to Save the Internet from Itself” (September, 2016).&nbsp; And now that memoir has been optioned to become a movie. Former Sony CEO Amy Pascal is the producer behind the project, and she has enlisted Lauren Schuker-Blum (the wife of Paranormal Activity producer Jason Blum) to cowrite the script. Scarlett Johansson is reportedly “one of several young actresses who have their eye on the role of Quinn.”8.&nbsp;CHAPPIE DIRECTOR NEILL BLOMKAMP LANDS POST-ALIEN 5 GIG ON THE GONE WORLDWhen it was confirmed that 20th Century Fox would not be moving forward on plans for the Alien 5, it seemed like pretty bad news for South African director Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Chappie). Blomkamp had spent much of 2015 hyping his plans for a new Alien movie with Ellen Ripley, until Fox confirmed that Ridley Scott’s Prometheus sequel would actually be called Alien: Paradise Lost. It sounds, however, like someone at 20th Century Fox is still looking out for Blomkamp and wants to continue working with him. Fox has acquired the rights to the upcoming sci-fi novel The Gone World by author Thomas Sweterlitsch, and the studio wants Neill Blomkamp to write and direct the adaptation. The details of the book aren’t yet known, except that it’s a “sci-fi time travel procedural.” 20th Century Fox is also nearing a deal with director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Edge of Tomorrow) to take on their Marvel Comics movie Gambit (starring Channing Tatum), which is scheduled for October 7, 2016.Rotten Idea of The Week1. DISNEY HAS SCRAPPED ALADDIN PREQUEL GENIESThe upside to all of the live action movies that Walt Disney Pictures has been adapting that audiences and critics continue to really like most of them (Cinderella is Certified Fresh at 85 percent, for example). So, with this week’s news, which can be interpreted both ways, there is something of a “bad news” angle to the idea of one of Disney’s planned movies being scrapped. The movie in question is called Genies, which was to have been a prequel to Aladdin, showing how that particular genie ended up in the bottle. However, the news broke this week that Robin Williams’ last will and testament had a 25 year provision preventing his likeness from being used in new films until the year 2039. And that appears to include Disney’s plans for Genies, because “production on the prequel has halted.” There will still be plenty of other live action adaptations of Disney movies in the years to come, such as The Jungle Book, Alice Through the Looking Glass, Pete’s Dragon, Beauty and the Beast, Cruella, Dumbo, Mulan, Night on Bald Mountain, Pinocchio, The Sword in the Stone, and Tink, but… a corresponding movie for Aladdin probably won’t be one of them.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Movies, sequels, universal, streaming, cinematic, comedy, Turner, Sundance","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13182019/JohnnyDepp.jpg","slug":"johnny-depp-will-lend-his-voice-to-sherlock-gnomes-and-more-hollywood-headlines"},{"id":"47613801883365","title":"The Weekly Ketchup: Keith Richards’s \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" Antics, Hermione’s \"Harry Potter\" Doubts, Stallone Speculation, And More!","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Weekly Ketchup: Keith Richards's \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" Antics, Hermione's \"Harry Potter\" Doubts, Stallone Speculation, And More!by Nick Hershey | September 29, 2006 |  CommentsIn this week’s Ketchup, Keith Richards is living up to everyone’s expectations on the set of the third \"Pirates\" installment, Emma Watson is experiencing growing pains with \"Harry Potter,\" and the Nolan brothers talk about \"The Dark Knight.\"Also, a full slate of big-name sequels is on the way next summer, and the rumors of Sylvester Stallone in \"Predator 3\" couldn’t possibly be true (could they?).

One of the most surprising projects (depending upon your cynicism)&nbsp;that can be compared to The LEGO Movie happened this week. After a high-pitched bidding war, Sony Pictures Animation has won, in a deal worth nearly $10 million, the feature film rights to the Emoji. Formerly popularly called “Smileys,”&nbsp;Emoji are the increasingly varied faces, usually yellow, that one finds available on smart phones, message chat, and other electronic forms of communication. Somewhat bizarrely for a deal that ended up with such a large scale, Emoji does not itself directly involve any sorts of rights, but the money was spent regardless. Like The LEGO Movie, those little “Emoji” icons do not have any pre-existing narrative structure on which to base a movie, which could be seen as a weakness in structuring the story, but it’s also potentially the grounds for wide open creativity for the writers Sony Pictures Animation hires to adapt the film.&nbsp;And those writers will be Eric Siegel, one of the producers of Men at Work, and Anthony Leondis, who wrote and directed the 2008 animated film Igor, and cowrote and codirected the direct-to-video sequel Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch.&nbsp; Sony Pictures has not yet set a release date for their Emoji movie. :O 😉 🙂Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;BENICIO DEL TORO IN TALKS TO PLAY VILLAIN IN STAR WARS EPISODE VIIIThanks to recent events like Lucasfilm’s panel at San Diego Comic-Con, we now know that three of the villains in this December’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens will be played by Domhnall Gleeson (Ex Machina), Gwendolyn Christie (HBO’s Game of Thrones), and Adam Driver (HBO’s Girls) (see a pattern there?). This week, we learned who Lucasfilm and director Rian Johnson (Looper) are talking to about playing the next big Star Wars villain. Benicio Del Toro is now in talks to costar as the main villain in Star Wars Episode VIII (5/26/17) (which will probably get a new title before release). Del Toro can currently be seen in theaters as the title character in Escobar: Paradise Lost, and he also has The Little Prince, Sicario, Weightless, and A Perfect Day coming soon.2. NON-SURPRISE-OF-THE-WEEK: JURASSIC WORLD SEQUEL ANNOUNCEDFairly frequently, in the arena of film development news, a story will break which is solidly in the “well, duh” category, but it’s still big news because of what exactly the story is about. Such is the case with the announcement this week that Universal Pictures has scheduled a sequel to Jurassic World (AKA the 5th Jurassic Park movie) for June 22, 2018. Director Colin Trevorrow won’t be returning in that position, but he will cowrite the script with Derek Connolly, his partner on both Jurassic World and Safety Not Guaranteed. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, whose characters did not die in Jurassic World (spoilers!), will be returning to star in the forthcoming&nbsp;sequel.&nbsp; It’s not yet known what this sequel will be about, exactly, though Jurassic World did certainly leave a few hints.3. ANGELINA JOLIE TO DIRECT KHMER ROUGE DRAMA FIRST THEY KILLED MY FATHER FOR NETFLIXHaving proven itself in the television arena, Netflix is increasingly setting&nbsp;its sights set on succeeding in feature films as well. Netflix has made a deal with Angelina Jolie Pitt (yes, she’s changed her name) for her to direct the memoir adaptation First They Killed My Father.&nbsp; The book by Loung Ung depicts her ordeal as a survivor of the massacres committed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in the 1970s, which included becoming a child soldier in a labor camp. Jolie-Pitt cowrote the script with Loung Ung, and will also produce the adaptation for Netflix, who will release First They Killed My Father on their streaming service in late 2016, as well as submitting the film to major film festivals and screening it in time for consideration in the 2016-2017 awards season.&nbsp; The 1984 film The Killing Fields was also about the Khmer Rouge atrocities, and was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, winning three (Supporting Actor, Cinematography, and Film Editing). Along with Brad Pitt,&nbsp;Jolie herself adopted her first child, Maddox, from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia, and has been active with international causes supporting orphans, refugees, and child immigration.4.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN LIVE ACTION DISNEY REMAKES: THE SWORD IN THE STONE&nbsp;It really does seem like we hear about a new live action adaptation of a Disney animated movie almost every week, and that notion was definitely supported this week. &nbsp;Following on the heels of&nbsp;last week’s news that Walt Disney Pictures is developing a live action prequel to Aladdin called Genies, we have another such movie this week. This time, the news is about a live action remake of Disney’s 1963 take on the King Arthur myth, The Sword in the Stone, which was also a loose adaptation of the novel by T.H. White. For this fantasy adaptation, Disney has hired Bryan Cogman, one of the writer-producers on HBO’s Game of Thrones, to adapt the script. It’s worth noting that this now puts Disney’s The Sword in the Stone in competition with Warner Bros’ multiple-film franchise, which will start with Knights of the Roundtable: King Arthur (7/22/16). Some of Disney’s other live action remakes include The Jungle Book (4/15/16), Alice Through the Looking Glass (5/27/16),&nbsp;Pete’s Dragon (8/12/16), Beauty and the Beast (3/17/17), Night on Bald Mountain, Dumbo, Prince Charming, Winnie the Pooh, Genies, and Mulan.5.&nbsp;WE’RE NOT GOING TO MAKE JOKE HEADLINES ABOUT AMY POEHLER AND BALLSA few days after Trainwreck was released to success, and with the Poehler/Fey movie Sisters coming this December, Universal Pictures has locked down one of their female comedians down for another film. Amy Poehler will produce and star in a basketball comedy currently known as Balls (a title which has not yet been finalized, in a last minute update). Poehler will play “a once-promising basketball coach who is asked to lead an NBA team” in the comedy. Ike Barinholtz, one of the stars of The Mindy Project, will also costar and cowrite with David Stassen, one of the producers of The Mindy Project. Poehler is currently filming the gambling comedy The House with Will Ferrell, and the Barinholtz/Stassen partnership is also behind the spy comedy Central Intelligence, starring Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson.6. LEONARDO DICAPRIO MAY STAR IN “EL CHAPO” DRAMA THE CARTELJust two weeks after his recent escape from prison, the Mexican drug lord known as “El Chapo” has inspired 20th Century Fox to move quickly on a movie based upon a novel in which El Chapo is a central figure. Yesterday, all in one day, we received two significant announcements about the film, called The Cartel.&nbsp;First, we heard that director Ridley Scott had signed on to direct The Cartel for Fox.&nbsp; The deal was reportedly struck late Wednesday night as other studios were also making their bids to both Scott and the book’s author Don Winslow. A few hours later, the news broke that Leonardo DiCaprio is now in talks to star in The Cartel as a fictional DEA agent whose friend is a member of El Chapo’s Sinaloa drug cartel. The script for The Cartel will be adapted by screenwriter Shane Salerno (Armageddon, Savages).7. IT’S ALWAYS SUNNY IN… MINECRAFTHollywood usually needs about three years to fully respond to box office surprises big enough that equivalent projects weren’t already in development. One such movie that has inspired similar projects (such as our headline, the Emoji movie) was last year’s The LEGO Movie. That film’s studio, Warner Bros, now has a slate of several spinoffs and sequels for The LEGO Movie (including The LEGO Batman Movie, Ninjago, The LEGO Movie 2, and The Billion Brick Race, all scheduled between 2017 and 2019). One of Warner Bros’ other development projects, which shares with LEGO the concept of “world building” using bricks, is the video game adaptation Minecraft. Last year, when the film was first announced, the attached director was Shawn Levy (Real Steel, Night at the Museum), but Levy has apparently left the project. Instead, this week, Mojang (the company behind Minecraft) announced that the project’s new director will be Rob McElhenney. Best known as one of the stars of TV’s It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, McElhenney has also directed a few episodes of that show, and has been looking for a while to make his feature film directorial debut. It’s not yet known exactly how the Minecraft movie will adapt the game’s premise to the big screen (live action? CGI? a hybrid of both?).8. DIRECTOR NEWS: FROM HORRIBLE BOSSES TO…&nbsp;BAYWATCH?We don’t see quite as many TV show adaptations making their way to the big screen these days, in deference to other trends, but there are a still few that are making their way through “development hell.” One such long-running project is at Paramount, a studio currently hungry for good projects in a year where they only have 5.7% of the market share. Paramount Pictures is making moves on that project, which is an adaptation of the hit 1990s “swimsuit jiggle cam” TV series, Baywatch. To that end, Paramount has hired director Seth Gordon, whose filmography includes Horrible Bosses&nbsp;and the video gaming documentary The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters.&nbsp; Dwayne Johnson is attached to star in the comedy, which is reportedly striving to tackle Baywatch in the same vein that 21 Jump Street adapted the Johnny Depp show. Filming of Baywatch is scheduled to start in early 2016, probably aiming for a release sometime in 2017.Rotten Idea of the Week1. LEBRON JAMES DEAL REBOUNDS SPACE JAM 2 RUMORSIf you follow movie deal news, or basketball celebrity news, you might remember that last year there were online rumors about LeBron James starring in Space Jam 2. That would, as the speculated title makes clear, be a sequel to the 1996 movie where the Looney Tunes (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, etc.) take on an alien team that stole the basketball skills of 1990s star players like Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, and Muggsy Bogues. Bill Murray was also in that movie. Anyway, the Space Jam 2 speculation was revived this week with the news that LeBron James’ Spring Hill Entertainment production company has made a deal with Warner Bros, the studio that owns the Looney Tunes characters, and Space Jam. The thing is, the actual news stops right there, mentioning no specific projects that Spring Hill and Warner Bros might make together. Really, the only movie mentioned is last week’s Trainwreck, in which LeBron James made his feature film debut (for WB’s rival studio, Universal Pictures).&nbsp; Anyway, we’re calling this the week’s Rotten Idea in case the speculation is correct, and this deal really does lead to Space Jam 2, since the first movie has a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 35&nbsp;percent.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Family, child's, dark, demand, Review, kaiju","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Emoji.jpg","slug":"an-emoji-movie-is-coming-jurassic-world-gets-a-sequel-and-lebron-james-could-star-in-space-jam-2"},{"id":"47509197828569","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise Accepts Mission: Impossible 6","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise Accepts Mission: Impossible 6Plus, Tommy Lee Jones joins fifth Bourne, Rache McAdams in talks with Marvel, a Nosferatu remake is on its way, and more.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 31, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you ten stories from the last seven days in the realm of film development news.&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are headlines involving such movies as Bourne 5, Marvel’s Doctor Strange, Gambit, Ghostbusters, Mission: Impossible 6, and the video game adaptation Five Nights at Freddy’s.This Week’s Top StoryTOM CRUISE ACCEPTS MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 6For quite a while, one of the commonly said things about Tom Cruise, Movie Star, is that he will do whatever it takes to promote his latest movie.&nbsp; Tom Cruise isn’t one of those movie stars who’s shy about talking to the press.&nbsp; And so, with Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation opening this week, Tom Cruise was indeed once again out there, answering questions, and what it led to was something of a deluge of new information about Tom Cruise’s future movies.&nbsp; The biggest reveal (though not necessarily the most surprising) happened on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, on which Tom Cruise revealed&nbsp;that there will indeed be a movie we’ll call for now, Mission: Impossible 6.&nbsp; Tom Cruise said the details are currently being worked out, and that he expects to be filming his 6th movie as Ethan Hunt in the summer of 2016 (possibly suggesting a release date in the summer of 2017).&nbsp; Also this week, Tom Cruise revealed&nbsp;to MTV that he has come up with an idea for a sequel to last year’s Edge of Tomorrow (although he didn’t reveal exactly what that is).&nbsp; Whatever the sequel might entail, Tom Cruise said that he has already talked to director Doug Liman and costar Emily Blunt about it (Blunt’s reply was reportedly, “Give me another year, please.”).&nbsp; Finally, more details were revealed this week about Bob: The Musical, in which Tom Cruise will play&nbsp;“a regular guy who, after a blow to the head, suddenly can hear the inner songs of everyone’s heart as his reality is instantly turned into a musical, much to his dismay.”&nbsp; Bob: The Musical will be directed by Michel Hazanavicius (The Artist) from a script by Michael Chabon (John Carter) with music by Bret McKenzie (HBO’s Flight of the Conchords).&nbsp; Walt Disney Pictures has not yet announced a release date for Bob: The Musical.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;TOMMY LEE JONES JOINS MATT DAMON IN FIFTH&nbsp;BOURNEAs with many similar franchises (like this week’s Mission: Impossible), each new movie in the Jason Bourne franchise sees both new faces along with returning cast playing their characters from previous movies.&nbsp; Even 2012’s The Bourne Legacy, which was ostensibly something of a post-Matt-Damon reboot, had several cast members from previous movies (namely, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney, and Corey Johnson).&nbsp; For their fifth movie, Universal has recruited Matt Damon to return as Jason Bourne, along with director Paul Greengrass, who directed The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum.&nbsp; We already have heard that Julia Stiles will be returning from previous films, and that Ex Machina star Alicia Vikander was the first announced new cast member. This week, we learned&nbsp;of the second new cast member, and that honor will go to Tommy Lee Jones.&nbsp; The former Men in Black star is expected to play “a superior officer at the CIA,” echoing the roles played by many of the previous older costars in the Bourne franchise.&nbsp; Universal Pictures has scheduled the 5th movie (possibly called The Bourne Betrayal) for July 29, 2016.2. RACHEL MCADAMS IN TALKS FOR FEMALE LEAD IN MARVEL’S&nbsp;DOCTOR STRANGEBack in April, in the weeks leading up to the release of Aloha, Forbes ran a story asking, “Why Rachel McAdams Never Became a Movie Star“.&nbsp; One possible answer is that Hollywood just doesn’t make romantic comedies like they used to, and they sort of stopped at exactly the moment when Rachel McAdams might have become a major “rom com” movie star.&nbsp; So, how exactly do actors and actresses today become bigger stars?&nbsp; One very common way is by taking roles in major super hero movies, which leads us to this week’s news.&nbsp; Rachel McAdams confirmed this week&nbsp;that she has been talking to Marvel Studios about signing on for the female lead in next year’s Doctor Strange (11/4/16).&nbsp; Emphasizing that this is not yet a firm confirmation, McAdams said, “It’s still super-early days, and I don’t know where that’s gonna go, if it’s gonna go anywhere at all.”&nbsp; So, if Rachel McAdams does indeed join Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton, and Chiwetel Ejiofor in Doctor Strange, who might she be playing?&nbsp; Although there are other possibilities, the female supporting character that seems most likely for Doctor Strange is probably Clea, the niece of Dormammu, one of Strange’s main enemies, and frequent romantic interest.&nbsp; Clea is also one of Doctor Strange’s longest-running romantic interests.&nbsp; And Rachel McAdams in a platinum wig would even sort of resemble the way that Clea is frequently depicted in the comics.&nbsp; Marvel Studios has scheduled Doctor Strange for November 4, 2016.3.&nbsp;VAMPIRE CLASSIC&nbsp;NOSFERATU&nbsp;TO GET ANOTHER REMAKEIt has now been 37 years since German director Werner Herzog remade F.W. Murnau’s classic 1922 silent film Nosferatu, under the title Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht.&nbsp; That Nosferatu has been adapted so rarely (he was also depicted in 2000’s Shadow of the Vampire) is surprising that the character he was based upon, Count Dracula, holds the record as the Most Portrayed Literary Character.&nbsp; (Sherlock Holmes is the most portrayed literary human character.)&nbsp; Director Robert Eggers, who made his debut with the upcoming indie horror film The Witch, has signed a deal to write and direct a remake&nbsp;of F.W. Murnau’s Nosferatu.&nbsp; That, unfortunately, is about all that we know about Eggers’ plans to remake Nosferatu.&nbsp; Among the details not known are whether it will be silent (or a “talkie”), black and white (or in color), live action (or animation), or if Robert Eggers will inadvertently cast a real life vampire who sets about devouring most of the crew.4.&nbsp;RECENTLY PAROLED SPY JONATHAN POLLARD TO GET HIS OWN BIOPICFor all of the examples where movie projects spend years (and sometimes, decades) in development, there are sometimes cases where Hollywood’s speed is quite remarkable.&nbsp; Consider convicted spy Jonathan Pollard&nbsp;who was arrested in 1985 on charges of sharing vital U.S. government secrets with Israel.&nbsp; On Tuesday morning, the news broke that Jonathan Pollard had been granted parole and will be released in November, 2015.&nbsp; By 11 minutes after Noon that same day, the news broke that producer Gail Berman is now developing &nbsp;a feature film based on Jonathan Pollard’s life and years in prison.&nbsp; Gail Berman is best known for executive producing the popular TV shows Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.&nbsp; The Jonathan Pollard feature film will be based upon the play The Law of Return, by Martin Blank, “which covers Pollard’s rocky employment by the U.S. Navy, and his motivations for turning spy.”5.&nbsp;DANIEL RADCLIFFE TO INFILTRATE HOMELAND TERRORISTS IN IMPERIUMWith the Harry Potter franchise increasingly in his rear view mirror, Daniel Radcliffe is continuing to build a new body of work as a prolific actor.&nbsp; This includes this November’s Victor Frankenstein (in which he plays Igor to James McAvoy’s title character), the indie “corpse comedy” Swiss Army Man, and the Rockstar Games biopic Game Changer.&nbsp; The latest movie to be added to Daniel Radcliffe’s IMDb profile is an inspired-by-real-events crime thriller&nbsp;called Imperium.&nbsp; Daniel Radcliffe will play a young FBI agent who is assigned undercover to infiltrate a group of white supremacists planning on constructing a “dirty bomb.”&nbsp; Imperium will be the feature film debut of short film director Daniel Ragnussis, who also cowrote the script with Michael German, the FBI undercover agent whose experiences form the basis for the movie.6.&nbsp;MORGAN FREEMAN MIGHT BE RE-ELECTED IN&nbsp;DOWN TO A SUNLESS SEAIn addition to the times he has played God, Morgan Freeman has also played the President of the United States in Deep Impact, and the Acting President in Olympus Has Fallen.&nbsp; This week, there was speculation that Morgan Freeman might again get the chance to be the POTUS again, based on one reference in this story.&nbsp; But first, the facts we know for sure.&nbsp; Morgan Freeman has signed with Focus Features to star in an action movie&nbsp;called Down to a Sunless Sea.&nbsp; Plot details aren’t yet known, except that Down to a Sunless Sea is said to be “similar in tone to Air Force One.”&nbsp; And that right there is why some people are speculating that Morgan Freeman might play the President in the movie, since the lead character in Air Force One was the President of the United States (as played by Harrison Ford).&nbsp; Down to a Sunless Sea was written by writer/director David Gleeson&nbsp;(The Front Line, Cowboys &amp; Angels), who has also directed his previous films, but it’s not yet known if he will also be directing Down to a Sunless Sea.Rotten IdeaS of the Week3. THIS WEEK IN&nbsp;GHOSTBUSTERS: HINTS AND DENIAL ABOUT THE PRATT/TATUM MOVIEAs of nine days ago, we are now less than a year away from the July 22, 2016 release of the new Ghostbusters (the movie with Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy, directed by Paul Feig). Back in March (a few months after Feig’s movie was confirmed), there began to be talk online of a second Ghostbusters movie which would be more action-centric, and possibly feature real life friends Chris Pratt and Channing Tatum.&nbsp; This week, while promoting Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, screenwriter Drew Pearce (who also cowrote Iron Man 3) was quoted as saying that he had “finished by work”&nbsp;on the Pratt/Tatum Ghostbusters.&nbsp; This led to the online film world sort of blowing up in response to an impending Ghostbusters with two&nbsp; of the hottest male action stars currently working.&nbsp; Subsequently, Drew Pearce took to Twitter to clarify, “Also, I’ve only written a bible (because I have to go off and direct my own stuff). No script yet. So news cycle: CHILL YOUR BOOTS.”&nbsp; That was then followed by this statement by director/producer Ivan Reitman&nbsp; (the man behind the first two Ghostbusters movies): “As the producer of the new Ghostbusters film, I feel the need to clarify. There is only one new Ghostbusters movie and that is the Paul Feig directed version coming next July, presently filming and going fantastically.&nbsp; The rest is just noise.”&nbsp; We’re calling this a “Rotten Idea” in case it really does mean we will never get a Pratt/Tatum Ghostbusters, and similarly, keep reading.2.&nbsp;OUTSPOKEN&nbsp;GAMBIT&nbsp;ENTHUSIAST CHANNING TATUM MAY FOLDThis was a week of ups and downs for 20th Century Fox’s plans for a solo Gambit movie, based on Marvel’s popular mutant character.&nbsp; First, there was the news that the studio was planning on a budget of over $154 million&nbsp;for Gambit, with filming to be starting in Louisiana in October under the direction of Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes).&nbsp; As promising as that news was for the fans who have been dreaming about a big budget Gambit movie since the early 1990s, it was soon overshadowed by the much more widely reported next news item.&nbsp; And that story (although not yet confirmed) is that Channing Tatum might be dropping out of starring&nbsp;in Gambit.&nbsp; This story was particularly baffling for many fans since Channing Tatum has been talking up his excitement about starring as Gambit since promoting White House Down two years ago (at a time when no one thought there was ever going to be a Gambit solo movie).&nbsp; It’s not yet known if Channing Tatum really will drop out of Gambit, or why he would do so.&nbsp; Some of the speculated reasons include conflicts with 23 Jump Street, the rumored Ghostbusters spinoff, and Channing Tatum’s plans to make his directorial debut.&nbsp; For the time being, 20th Century Fox still has Gambit scheduled for release on October 7, 2016.1.&nbsp;VIDEO GAME MOVIES STILL BEING GREENLIT:&nbsp;FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY’SPixels opened last week to disappointing box office&nbsp;(compared to its budget), continuing a trend for video game adaptation movies that dates back decades.&nbsp; Even so, Hollywood still keeps putting video game adaptations into development, with the hope apparently being each time that the given project will be the one that upsets critical and box office patterns.&nbsp; Such movies that are currently on their way include The Angry Birds Movie (5/20/16), Warcraft (6/10/16),&nbsp; Assassin’s Creed (12/21/16), and the Minecraft movie.&nbsp; Warner Bros is also moving forward&nbsp;with plans for a feature film adaptation of the popular survival horror video game franchise Five Nights at Freddy’s.&nbsp; The games are set in a children’s theme restaurant called Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, where at night, the title animatronic animal comes alive to wreak unholy terror on anyone unlucky enough to be there. The first game came out in 2014, and there’s already been four games in the franchise.&nbsp; The Five Nights at Freddy’s movie will be directed by Gil Kenan, who made his debut in 2006 with the “Fresh” animated movie Monster House, which was followed by two “Rotten” scores for City of Ember (53%) and this year’s Poltergeist remake (33%).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"park, movie, Year, Trailer, canceled, Academy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MI-Accpted.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-tom-cruise-accepts-mission-impossible-6"},{"id":"47509199643112","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Ryan Gosling in Talks for Blade Runner 2","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Ryan Gosling in Talks for Blade Runner 2Plus, new roles for Eddie Redmayne, Chris Pratt, and Steve Carell.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 17, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes top movie development news stories for such titles as Blade Runner 2, Captain Marvel, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (the Harry Potter spinoff), Flash Gordon, Pitch Perfect 3, and X-Men: Apocalypse.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryWILL RYAN GOSLING BE A REPLICANT IN BLADE RUNNER 2?Yesterday, the Internet collectively wiped away a nostalgic tear when Harrison Ford was first shown as Han Solo in the second teaser trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Over at 20th Century Fox (the former home for Star Wars), they might be hoping for a similar glow of nostalgia for their Blade Runner sequel, in which Harrison Ford will also be costarring, returning as Rick Deckard. This week, we learned that the sequel’s star will be Ryan Gosling, who is now in talks with 20th Century Fox. Not many other details are currently known about Blade Runner 2, except that it will be directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies), whose next film, Sicario, was also announced this week as being an official entry at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. That, however, was not the only Ryan Gosling news this week, as he’s also considering reuniting with his Crazy Stupid Love costar, Emma Stone, in a romantic musical called La La Land. The Lionsgate musical will be directed by Damien Chazelle, who is something of a hotly pursued talent in Hollywood following the success of Whiplash.&nbsp;Fresh Developments This Week1. EDDIE REDMAYNE MIGHT STAR IN HARRY POTTER SPINOFFAs Warner Bros prepares to launch its next franchise with J.K. Rowling, one of this year’s critical darlings is emerging as the studio’s top choice to star. The spinoff franchise is called Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and the key character in all of it is the book’s “author,” Newt Scamander. No deal is in place yet, but the actor Warner Bros hopes to cast as Newt Scamander is Eddie Redmayne, who won the Best Actor Academy Award this year for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking The Theory of Everything. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is seen by Warner Bros as the first of a new franchise of films featuring Newt Scamander, in his adventures in the magical New York City of the 1930s. The first movie (11/18/16) will be directed by David Yates, who directed the most recent Harry Potter movies, and also has a reboot of Tarzan coming in 2016 (7/1/16) with Warner Bros.&nbsp;2. IS CHRIS PRATT THE REAL MCCOY?After a competitive bidding war this week, Universal Pictures has landed the rights to a biopic called The Real McCoy, about Prohibition Era bootlegger and smuggler Bill McCoy, who helped popularize the expression. A big reason for the interest from so many studios is that red-hot-right-now movie star Chris Pratt is already attached to star in it. The pitch was written by screenwriter Bill Dubuque, who made his debut last year with The Judge, and also has the Ben Affleck movie The Accountant coming soon. Universal’s acquisition of The Real McCoy can be seen as part of an overall strategy at keeping the actor at the studio, following his starring turn this summer in Jurassic World.&nbsp;3. STEVE CARELL TO STAR IN DOCUMENTARY ADAPTATION MARWENCOLWe don’t know if this is going to become a new trend, but acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future) will be going back-to-back with movies adapted from documentary features. You may have have already seen the trailer for The Wire (10/2/15), starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, which was adapted from the 2008 Academy Award winner Man on Wire. Next up, Zemeckis will be directing a narrative adaptation of the 2010 documentary Marwencol, and Steve Carell will be starring in it. Carell will play a man recovering from brain damage who recreates a World War II-era Belgian town in his backyard, with various dolls representing himself, his family, friends, and other figures in his life. The narrative film’s script was adapted by Caroline Thompson, who is best known for her movies with Tim Burton, such as Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and (as cowriter) Corpse Bride.&nbsp;4. REBEL WILSON ALREADY SIGNED FOR PITCH PERFECT 3We may still be two days shy of a month away from Pitch Perfect 2 hitting theaters (5/15/15), but Universal Pictures appears to already be making its future plans for what could be another surprise franchise for them, ala Fast and Furious. A writer for the Los Angeles Times took to Twitter this week (rather than, apparently, actually giving her employer an exclusive story) to break the news that Rebel Wilson is signed to star in the musical sequel Pitch Perfect 3. That’s about all that could fit in a 140 character Tweet, so unfortunately, we don’t know much else about the sequel just yet.&nbsp;5.&nbsp;X-MEN: FIRST CLASS DIRECTOR TACKLES FLASH GORDONDirector Matthew Vaughn has developed a post-Layer Cake filmography with a solid streak of “Fresh” Tomatometer ratings, and one of his secrets might have been to not stay on one franchise too long. Vaughn directed just X-Men: First Class, just the first Kick-Ass movie, and recently, he directed the first Kingsman: The Secret Service. And already, Matthew Vaughn is in talks with 20th Century Fox to direct the first movie in another new franchise (which is actually a very, very old franchise). Matthew Vaughn is in talks to direct the studio’s long-in-development reboot of Flash Gordon, returning to the “space opera” adventure at just the point when space operas are hot properties in Hollywood, thanks to Guardians of the Galaxy. First created in 1934 as a comic strip, Flash Gordon is an American football star who accidentally ends up on the planet Mongo, where he takes on the evil Ming the Emperor. And inspires Queen songs and Seth McFarlane comedies.&nbsp;6. THIS WEEK IN MARVEL: CAPTAIN MARVEL, THE (SECOND) SPIDER-MAN REBOOTThe Marvel news this week mostly consists of light updates on stuff we already knew from various people doing press for Avengers: Age of Ultron, but what new stuff we did hear had no direct connection to that movie at all. The main focus was Captain Marvel (11/2/18), which will be about Marvel’s character by that name, AKA Carol Danvers (previously known as Ms. Marvel). We still don’t know who will play Carol Danvers, but this week, we reached another important milestone in the movie’s development. Marvel Studios has hired two screenwriters to work collaboratively on their separate pitch ideas for Captain Marvel, to blend both ideas into one feature film. Those two writers are Nicole Perlman (whose initial in-house script for Guardians of the Galaxy is credited with helping get the movie greenlit) and Meg LeFauve, who will be making her feature film debut with this summer’s Pixar animated comedy Inside Out. There was also news this week that Marvel’s top choice to direct Captain Marvel is Angelina Jolie, especially now that one of their previous possible choices (Patty Jenkins) has signed on to direct Wonder Woman for Marvel’s Distinguished Competition. Jolie has mostly been directing “passion projects” to date, but she might be ready to make the jump to a big superhero adventure like Captain Marvel. Finally, Marvel Studios producer Kevin Feige confirmed this week that when Spider-Man enters the Marvel Cinematic Universe next year in Captain America: Civil War, the character will be Peter Parker, and he will be a high school student.&nbsp;7. SIR IAN MCKELLEN TO PLAY COGSWORTH IN BEAUTY AND THE BEASTAfter six movies as Gandalf and (at least) five movies as Magneto, Sir Ian McKellen still appears to be interested in big genre projects. We know that because this week we learned that McKellen has joined the cast of Disney’s live action remake of Beauty and the Beast. Sir Ian McKellen will play the butler Cogsworth who, when a curse is cast on a castle’s staff, is transformed into a singing and dancing clock. Emma Watson and Dan Stevens are playing the title characters, and some of the other staff will be played by Emma Thompson (Mrs. Potts), Audra McDonald (Garderobe), and Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Plumette). Walt Disney Pictures has scheduled Beauty and the Beast for March 17, 2017.&nbsp;8. OLIVIA MUNN CAST AS PSYLOCKE IN X-MEN: APOCALYPSELike many of 20th Century Fox’s X-Men movies, the cast of next year’s X-Men: Apocalypse (5/27/16) is continuing to grow to the point where you need a cheat sheet to remember all of the characters that will be in the movie. This week’s addition brings one of Marvel’s most popular mutant heroines back to the big screen. Olivia Munn, formerly of G4TV’s Attack the Show and HBO’s The Newsroom, has been cast as Psylocke. Who and what Psylocke is depends upon what era of Marvel you’re reading (though most of the time, she’s a little of both). Psylocke started as the English telepathic sister of Captain Britain, and then through some mind-swapping, she became a Japanese ninja (with psychic attacks). Although Olivia Munn is neither British nor Japanese, her heritage is half-Chinese, and she spent much of her childhood living in Japan. In other Fox mutant movie casting, we learned that Ryan Reynolds will be joined in Deadpool (2/12/16) by newcomer Brianna Hildebrand, who will play the young Goth telepath known as Negasonic Teenage Warhead. (Last minute news: Lucas Till will also be returning in X-Men: Apocalypse as Havok.)&nbsp;Rotten Idea of the Week1.&nbsp;BREAKING BAD DIRECTOR DROPS OUT OF WONDER WOMANSeven days is not a long time, but it’s long enough that a story can break and we can already know the resolution of the problem it poses by the time the Weekly Ketchup covers it. That’s what happened this week when we learned that Breaking Bad/The Walking Dead director Michelle Maclaren had dropped out of directing Wonder Woman for Warner Bros over unspecified “creative differences.” Of course, when something is left unspecified, people are going to try to figure out the specifics. One rumor put out there was that Maclaren had wanted a tiger sidekick that she could talk to, leading some to theorize that Maclaren wanted to use Tawky Tawny, the talking tiger sidekick of the 1940s Captain Marvel. All of that happened before this story broke earlier today saying that Maclaren’s vision for Wonder Woman was “an epic origin tale in the vein of” Braveheart, whereas Warner Bros wanted “a more character-driven story that was less heavy on action.” And we also now know the director who will adapt Warner Bros’ vision, and it’s Patty Jenkins, who had one point had been attached to direct Thor: The Dark World. When Wonder Woman is released on June 23, 2017, it will mark 13 years since Patty Jenkins made her feature film debut in 2004 with the Charlize Theron movie Monster. In the years since, Jenkins has directed episodes of the TV shows The Killing and Betrayal (44% and 8% Rotten, respectively).&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook&nbsp;","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Captain, movies, Mary, monsters, Certified","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ryan-gosling.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-ryan-gosling-in-talks-for-blade-runner-2"},{"id":"47509199647209","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Ryan Gosling in Talks for Guillermo Del Toro’s Haunted Mansion","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Ryan Gosling in Talks for Guillermo Del Toro's Haunted MansionPlus, a live action Pinocchio, Stephen King's The Dark Tower, and remakes of Gremlins and She's All That.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 10, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you seven days’ worth of film development news stories, including news about Stephen King’s The Dark Tower, The Flash, Gremlins, Need for Speed 2, Disney’s live-action Pinocchio, and new roles for Vin Diesel, Ryan Gosling, Daniel Radcliffe, and Chris Tucker.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryRYAN GOSLING TO SPEND THE NIGHT AT DISNEY’S HAUNTED MANSIONEver since Ryan Gosling first emerged as a true grown up movie star, the question has lingered out there as to when he would take a break from indie movies and return home to the Mouse House where he got his start. And we’re not talking about something like Remember the Titans, but a full-on, unashamedly “Disney” Disney movie. Well, this week, we finally got the answer, as Ryan Gosling is teaming up with director Guillermo del Toro on his long-in-development Disney attraction adaptation, Haunted Mansion. The timing of the movement forward on Haunted Mansion is interesting, as GDT currently has another ghost/haunted house project, Crimson Peak, coming to theaters later this year (10/16/15). One would have to guess that del Toro’s Haunted Mansion will feel like a more family-friendly take on the spooky scares we will see in Crimson Peak.Fresh Developments This Week1 VIN DIESEL AND CHRIS TUCKER JOIN BILLY LYNN’S LONG HALFTIME WALKBefore this week, it’s likely that only the most avid followers of film development news were aware of Life of Pi/Brokeback Mountain director Ang Lee‘s HFR Iraq War project Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk. The lead is a newcomer named Joe Alwyn, and he was known to be supported by Garrett Hedlund, Kristen Stewart, and Steve Martin, but in most news cycles, this project has been somewhat buried “below the fold,” as we say in the world of pubishing. That arguably changed this week with the news that Vin Diesel, hot off Furious 7, along with not-really-prolific actor Chris Tucker, are both in talks for supporting roles. Vin Diesel will play one of the soldiers in the war movie, and Chris Tucker will play a Hollywood producer interested in turning their story into a big time movie. Possibly in HFR.2 DISNEY’S LIVE ACTION PLANS CONTINUE WITH PINOCCHIOOne of the most consistent themes of the Srping of 2015 has been Walt Disney Pictures’ plans for live action adaptations of their classic animated features. Just last week, our top story concerned such plans for Mulan and Winnie the Pooh. One of the remaining popular classics that hadn’t yet been announced before this week was their second film ever, Pinocchio (1940). Well, we can now cross that one off the list, because Disney has hired formerly-indie screenwriter/director Peter Hedges (Dan in Real Life, Pieces of April) to do exactly that. Much like how there are two adaptations of The Jungle Book coming (Disney’s on 4/15/16, Warner Bros’ Jungle Book: Origins on 10/6/17), Disney’s Pinocchio plans are not the only ones. Guillermo del Toro has also been developing a stop-motion Pinocchio for a few years now.3 DANIEL RADCLIFFE TO STAR IN THE GRAND THEFT AUTO MOVIE (BUT IT’S NOT WHAT YOU THINK)As one of the most successful franchises of the last 15 years of video gaming, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a movie would eventually spring out of Grand Theft Auto. It’s probably more surprising that this hasn’t happened yet. Or maybe what’s really surprising is that the star of Grand Theft Auto will be Daniel Radcliffe, AKA Harry Potter. Radcliffe is in talks to star in Grand Theft Auto as the video game franchise’s cocreator Sam Houser of Rockstar Games, in a BBC Films feature film about Houser’s battles with Miami lawyer Jack Thompson. The role hasn’t been cast yet for Jack Thompson, whose crusade against violence in video games followed previous censorship efforts against movies and rap music. The Grand Theft Auto movie (which may be retitled to Rockstar Games) is based upon the David Kushner non-fiction book, Jacked: The Outlaw Story of Grand Theft Auto. In other video game movie news, the 2014-2015 indie point-and-click horror-adventure series Five Nights at Freddy’s is now in development as a movie. The series about animatronic bears at a Chuck-E-Cheese-ish pizza chain on a murderous rampage at night is being produced by Seth Grahame-Smith, the writer best known for Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies, and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.4 THE DARK TOWER REVIVED AT SONY PICTURESFive years ago, in 2010, Stephen King fans were excited to hear about the ambitious plans that director Ron Howard had for a multiple-stage adaptation of the series The Dark Tower. The plan at that time was for Universal Pictures to produce a trilogy of big-budget feature films, with HBO at the same time producing a TV series that would fill in other stories from elsewhere in the extended epic. Money issues motivated Universal to drop out, and then the projects were at Warner Bros, and then the same thing happened. Well, perhaps the third studio will be the charm, because Sony Pictures, as part of their continuing search for new franchises, has now boarded the Dark Tower bandwagon. Ron Howard is no longer attached to direct, however, with the Fringe team of Akiva Goldsman and Jeff Pinkner reportedly working on the first film’s script.5 THIS WEEK IN DC COMICS MOVIES: DIRECTOR RUMORS FOR THE FLASH, AQUAMAN, AND ???We’re now several months after Warner Bros’ and DC Comics’ big announcement last year about their plans stretching to 2020 about movies for most of the members of their Justice League (and that team’s first movies). What we were lacking before this week was any sort of hint about what directors might be joining the likes of Zack Snyder and David Ayer in the growing DC Comics Cinematic Universe. Well, in just seven days, we started to learn exactly that. First up, there’s The Flash (3/23/18), which will be following the success of the TV show version on The CW. We now know that the team of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are working as writers on a story treatment for The Flash, which Ezra Miller is attached to star in. Their involvement is especially interesting, because Lord and Miller are known for their comedic work on the 21 Jump Street franchise and The LEGO Movie, which is arguably a departure from the tone of Man of Steel. We also heard this week that director James Wan, who has worked on the Saw franchise and this week’s Furious 7, is the “studio’s choice” to direct Aquaman (7/27/18), though no talks have yet started. Finally, there was a rumor this week about another set of directors, and this time, it was Chad Stahelski and David Leith, of last year’s John Wick. The current story is that WB/DC have their eye on the duo, although what movie exactly that might be, is unknown. In addition to The Flash and Aquaman, directors are still needed for Shazam, Cyborg, and Green Lantern. Additionally, there are also rumors online now about WB/DC possibly developing a solo movie for Red Hood, AKA one of Batman’s former Robin partners (whose story sort of mirrors that of the Winter Soldier over at Marvel).6 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL NEWS: ERNIE HUDSON RUMORED TO BE BLACK PANTHER‘S DAD?There sure were a lot of unconfirmed rumors this week. One of them involves one of Marvel’s farther afield movies, Black Panther (7/6/18). Although that movie is over three years away, we’ve already heard plenty of hints that the character will actually be featured first in next year’s Captain America: Civil War (5/6/16). And that’s what leads us to the rumor this week that Ghostbusters star Ernie Hudson is working out and reading up on Black Panther, in preparation for playing King T’Chaka, the father of T’Challa, to be played by the already cast Chadwick Boseman. Strictly speaking, T’Chaka is also Black Panther, as that is a title given to the leaders of that Wakandan tribe, T’Chaka being the predecessor of T’Challa of the Avengers (T’Chaka was not a member of the Avengers). What gives the Ernie Hudson rumor some weight is that filming of Captain America: Civil War starts soon, so if there’s going to be a T’Chaka in the movie, well, someone has to be cast as the character. This news also potentially puts Ernie Hudson in theaters next summer two months before the Ghostbusters reboot, which he has been vocal about in the past. And in other Marvel news, it was confirmed this week that the two parts of Avengers: Infinity War (5/4/18 and 5/3/19) will be a reunion for the directors and writers of both Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the upcoming Captain America: Civil War. All four of those movies were/will be directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, working from scripts by the team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.Rotten Ideas of the Week3 THIS WEEK IN MONSTER MOVIE REMAKES: GREMLINS, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOONSome movies take so long to get made that they can actually predate movies from the 1990s that are themselves in development to get remade again (specifically, we’re thinking of The Mummy). Another monster movie classic that has been in varying degrees of development is The Creature from the Black Lagoon. That remake actually dates all the way back to the early 1980s, when then-red-hot John Landis was hoping to produce a version directed by Jack Arnold, who directed the original 1954 movie. The Black Lagoon remake has taken various forms in the 30+ years since (really far more than we can detail here). Well, this week, the Black Lagoon remake “surfaced” again with a rumor that Scarlett Johansson has been offered the lead role (as a scientist, not the Creature, though that could be on this side of awesome). If this movie ever does finally happen, it will be part of Universal’s struggling (following the disappointing 23% Rotten bestowed upon Dracula Untold) plans for reboots of their “Classic Universal Monsters.” In similar territory this week, we learned that Warner Bros is still pursuing plans for a Gremlins remake, and that remake specialist screenwriter Carl Ellsworth has been hired to work on precisely that. Ellsworth’s previous remakes have included Red Dawn and The Last House on the Left (and Ellsworth also has the Goosebumps movie with Jack Black coming out on 10/16/15).2 REMAKE FEVER HITS THE LATE 1990S, BECAUSE… SHE’S ALL THATAlthough we’re now 15 years into another century, Hollywood’s remake frenzy has for the most part avoided the 1990s. That may soon change, however, since today’s 20/30-somethings grew up in that decade. One of the hot trends of the late 1990s was the “teen comedy” wave, evidenced by such popular titles as Clueless, American Pie, Can’t Hardly Wait, Good Burger, and 10 Things I Hate About You. The reasonably budgeted teen movie (like romantic comedies and non-Oscar-Bait-dramas) is nearly literally the sort of movie they don’t make anymore, but this story suggests that at least someone is considering changing that. The Weinstein Company and Miramax are partnering on a remake of the 1999 teen romantic comedy She’s All That, which starred Freddie Prinze Jr and Rachael Leigh Cook, with supporting roles for Matthew Lillard, Anna Paquin, and the late Paul Walker. The premise of She’s All That is nearly a remake of Pygmalion, as a teen boy is challenged to turn a girl who wears glasses and overalls into a “hot girl” who, in a shocking twist, does not wear glasses or overalls. She’s All That is basically the teen comedy version of Clark Kent turning into Superman. The remake will be directed by Kenny Leon, whose previous TV work has included the 2002 adaptation of A Raisin the Sun, and a 2012 remake of Steel Magnolias, starring Queen Latifah. Spike Lee’s wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, is also producing the She’s All That remake, which might this time feature an African-American cast. The original She’s All That has a Rotten Tomatometer score of 38%.1 CHINA FEELS A NEED FOR SPEED… SO THERE WILL BE A SEQUELAs the Chinese moviegoing audience continues to grow each year, so grows its unpredictable influence on the industry. For example, Transformers: Age of Extinction was the #7 movie of the year 2014 here, but because of the $846 million that film earned overseas, it was the #1 movie of 2014 in worldwide box office. An even more severe example of the box office disparity between these two markets is last year’s racing videogame adaptation Need for Speed. That movie starring Aaron Paul earned only $43.6 million domestically (and was a critical bomb with just 22% on the Tomatometer), but over $200 million worldwide, with $65 million of that coming from China. And so, an alliance of Chinese producers and financial partners are teaming up with Electronic Arts to develop a Need for Speed sequel. If a deal can be reached with DreamWorks, the sequel would be filmed primarily in China, and feature several Chinese actors and actresses. It’s not yet known if Aaron Paul (from TV’s Breaking Bad) would also return for the sequel. In similar news, the China Film Group is partnering with Paramount Pictures on a fantasy-action movie about Marco Polo, with Hayden Christensen (of the Star Wars prequels) starring as the Venetian merchant who had real life adventures in China in the 13th century. This will be Hayden Christensen’s first studio movie in five years since the 2010 thriller Takers.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Marvel, Grammys, WarnerMedia, CBS, Epix, Swim, Land, serial, science, CW, Rocketman, vampires, Comic-Con, psychological","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ryan-gosling-3.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-ryan-gosling-in-talks-for-guillermo-del-toros-haunted-mansion"},{"id":"47509199660525","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Disney Announces Frozen Sequel","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Disney Announces Frozen SequelPlus, Star Wars updates, Ghostbusters rumors, Tron 3, and a live-action Dumbo.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 13, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup comes to you with a particularly strong batch of movie development news items, especially from Walt Disney Pictures and its subsidiaries (which includes Frozen 2, Star Wars: Rogue One, Star Wars Episode VIII, TRON 3, and the live action remake of… Dumbo). There was also news about a Ghostbusters action movie, and biopics about boxer Mike Tyson, P.O.W. Bowe Bergdahl, and comedian Richard Pryor.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryDISNEY ANNOUNCES FROZEN SEQUELWhen any movie earns over $1.27 billion, it shouldn’t be particularly surprising when the studio eventually announces plans for some sort of sequel or follow up, but that doesn’t mean it’s still not really, really big and good news for all of the fans. Such is exactly what happened for the Frozen franchise this week (just as the short film Frozen Fever is premiering in theaters in front of Cinderella this weekend). The announcement wasn’t particularly lengthy, but it did include a few crucial details, such as the return of directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, and voice actor Josh Gad as the voice of Olaf the comic relief snowman. What was specifically missing in the announcement was the rest of the voice cast, including Kristen Bell (Anna) and Idina Menzel (Elsa), but… their omissions were probably just due to continuing negotiations. For example, Idina Menzel has already talked relatively recently about plans for a Frozen sequel. As for when Frozen 2 can be expected in theaters, fans should probably dress snugly, because the wait in Arendelle might be a few years. Walt Disney Animated Features has already scheduled their next three feature films, which Frozen 2 would ostensibly have to follow. The animal comedy Zootopia is scheduled for March 4, 2016; the Pacific Islands adventure Moana is scheduled for November 23, 2016, and the “Jack and the Beanstalk” adventure Giants is scheduled for March 9, 2018. So, it’s probably going to be at least three years yet before Frozen 2 will be ready for release.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;STAR WARS: ROGUE ONE ANNOUNCED FOR 12/16/16, STAR WARS EPISODE VIII FOR 5/26/17The down side for Walt Disney Pictures now having their corporate fingers in so many franchise pies is that it’s possible for the company to make a series of huge announcements which are overshadowed by their own titles (other studios might file that as “the sort of problems you’d like to have”). After months (more like years, actually) of speculation about what the first Star Wars spinoff might be, we learned this week that the film will be titled Star Wars: Rogue One. Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything) has also landed the lead role, and Walt Disney Pictures has scheduled Star Wars: Rogue One for December 16, 2016. That Rogue One subtitle quickly had fans speculating connections to both Luke Skywalker’s SW:ANH designation of Rogue 5, and the Rogue Squadron books and video games. Speculation that Star Wars: Rogue One might be about pilots of X-Wings (or other similar vehicles) was quickly followed by reports about the concept art for the film (which manages to give new information without supporting any one theory). Star Wars Episode VIII was also announced this week as being scheduled for release on May 26, 2017, which will be 40 years and 1 day after the May 25, 1977 release date of the first Star Wars movie. The return of Star Wars to a May release date in 2017 quickly led 20th Century Fox to move their Fantastic Four sequel back a week to June 9, 2017, while Warner Bros’ The LEGO Batman Movie remains on May 26, 2017. Star Wars: Rogue One will be directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters, Godzilla), and Star Wars Episode III will be directed (and written) by Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom, Looper).2. CHANNING TATUM AND CHRIS PRATT TO STAR IN A GHOSTBUSTERS ACTION MOVIE?It wasn’t really that long ago that we learned Sony was planning on changing things up considerably by rebooting Ghostbusters with a quartet of female stars. In fact, it was only 6 weeks ago, and in the same week that we first heard about Chris Pratt possibly playing Indiana Jones. Exactly how recent all of that makes this week’s news sort of surprising, but perhaps the best way to look at what comes next in this story is as being a reflection of Sony’s interest in building a “Ghostbusters Cinematic Universe.” Ivan Reitman is producing a “male-driven” Ghostbusters action movie that might be directed by Joe and Anthony Russo after Captain America: Civil War (under their deal which just made the news last week). Channing Tatum and his real-life friend Chris Pratt have been mentioned as possible stars in such a movie. This “action movie” Ghostbusters would be ostensibly part of a planned four movie franchise, followed by a third movie where the ladies and male action stars team up, and then a fourth movie would be a prequel (possibly rebooting the original guys back in the 1980s originated by Bill Murray and friends?). Some of this does read online as speculation, but as of this writing, Sony Pictures hasn’t flat-out debunked it quite yet. In somewhat related news, Jeremy Renner was confirmed this week as costarring as Hawkeye in next year’s Captain America: Civil War.3. JAMIE FOXX SAYS MARTIN SCORSESE WILL DIRECT HIM AS MIKE TYSONWe’ve known since last summer that Jamie Foxx was attached to play boxer Mike Tyson in an untitled biopic, but this week, Jamie Foxx talked about the project, and dropped something of a bombshell about the project’s director. Pretty much the entire story is in Jamie Foxx’s quote, so here it is, “I just went in with Paramount with Mike Tyson. So I’m going to do the Mike Tyson story. Listen, to be in the same room pitching Mike Tyson to Paramount, Mike Tyson is on one side, I’m on the other side and doing Mike Tyson at the same time. And Martin Scorsese at the helm. This will be the first boxing movie that Martin Scorsese has done since Raging Bull.” If Martin Scorsese does sign on with Paramount Pictures to direct the Mike Tyson biopic (which is being written by his Boardwalk Empire collaborator Terence Winter), it will have to wait until after he wraps the Japan-set drama Silence, which is expected in 2016.4. KATHRYN BIGELOW STAYS AT WAR WITH BOWE BERGDAHL BIOPICThe competition for the title of the top U.S. box office total of 2014 was not boring to follow, with claimants to the title previously being Transformers: Age of Extinction, Guardians of the Galaxy, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1. This week, however, the final winner was confirmed to have been American Sniper (though most of its $337 million was actually earned within the 2015 calendar year). It’s unlikely that there will be (or could be) a “sequel” to a biopic about a murdered veteran, but such a success can certainly help other war time true stories be greenlit. And that appears to exactly what has happened for director Kathryn Bigelow, whose last two films have been The Hurt Locker (Iraq), and Zero Dark Thirty (the hunt for Osama bin Laden). This week, it was revealed that Kathryn Bigelow’s next film will be adapted from the true story of Taliban P.O.W. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, whose eventual release was followed by controversy and speculation over the events that led to his capture. It’s possible that we will be soon hearing about developments for other similarlyy timely projects, such as Ashley’s War (about female soldiers in Afghanistan, possibly starring Reese Witherspoon), Three Days in Paris (about the Charlie Hebdo massacre), and the period piece The Yankee Comandante (about Fidel Castro’s rise in Cuba, possibly starring Matt Damon).5. EDDIE MURPHY TO PLAY RICHARD PRYOR’S FATHERIt’s been long enough since Eddie Murphy’s career as a stand up comedian was still an ongoing enterprise that one might be forgiven for no longer thinking of him as one, but in the 1980s, Murphy was one of the most popular stand ups. In the past, he’s been honest about his debt through inspiration to comedian Richard Pryor, and the two costarred together in the 1989 film Harlem Nights. This week, director Lee Daniels (Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire, Lee Daniel’s The Butler) hinted what was soon confirmed: Eddie Murphy is now in talks with the Weinstein Company to costar in their untitled Richard Pryor biopic as the comedian’s boxer father, LeRoy “Buck Carter” Pryor. Kate Hudson has also signed to play Pryor’s wife, Jennifer Pryor. Murphy and Hudson join the already cast Mike Epps as Richard Pryor himself, and Oprah Winfrey as Pryor’s grandmother Marie Carter.6. KRISTEN STEWART, JESSE EISENBERG, AND BRUCE WILLIS HEADLINE WOODY ALLEN’S 2016 FILMIf one ignores the less successful films that result, Woody Allen’s prolificacy has to be respected. With pretty much every progression into a new calendar year, Allen directs a movie that he also found the time to write. He found critical and box office success in 2013 with Blue Jasmine, last year’s film Magic in the Moonlight was less so, and his film for 2015 will be Irrational Man (7/24/15). As is usual with Woody Allen’s process, we don’t yet know a premise or title for what will become his 2016 release, but this week, we did learn who the next film’s stars will be. Kristen Stewart will be the latest actress to benefit (hopefully) from working with a Woody Allen script, along with Bruce Willis and Jesse Eisenberg (who previously costarred in Woody Allen’s To Rome with Love).Rotten Ideas of the Week3. TIM BURTON TO DIRECT DISNEY’S LIVE ACTION REMAKE OF… DUMBO?With Cinderella opening this weekend, The Jungle Book coming in 2016 (4/15/16), followed by Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass (5/27/16), Pete’s Dragon (8/12/16) and Beauty and the Beast (probably in 2017), it’s clear that Walt Disney Pictures is thickly committed to remaking their older films. Indeed, this focus is ramping up next year to three such remakes in a single year (well, two if the Alice in Wonderland sequel isn’t counted). And it doesn’t look like Disney immediately has a reason to ramp back, because these films continue to be successful. However, the longer a winning streak keeps going, probability suggests at some point, it’s going to end. In what would have been the biggest story of the week in a less active week, we learned this week that Walt Disney Pictures has found their director for their live-action remake of Dumbo. Their choice is Tim Burton, who previously delivered Alice in Wonderland, the film which basically kicked off this entire recent wave of live-action-remakes-of-Disney-animated-classics. Dumbo, however, seems like a much more challenging project, which seems to have a polarizing choice of results. As for how a live action Dumbo fits into Tim Burton’s ouvre, this writer wonders if maybe it might resemble Big Fish, or Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure, since it’s obviously a circus (and if you’re not familiar with Dumbo, a baby elephant and his mom). We may be a few years from seeing Tim Burton actually start filming his Dumbo remake, since he’s currently in Florida filming Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, and is also expected to film Beetlejuice 2 soon. We’re calling this story a borderline “Rotten Idea” based on the Rotten scores that a few of Tim Burton’s recent films have been earning (51% for Alice in Wonderland, 37% for Dark Shadows).2. MILES TELLER TO ROB BANKS IN THE LIFE AND TIMES OF THE STOPWATCH GANGMiles Teller may not have himself been nominated for an Oscar for Whiplash, but that he may still be benefitting from his association with one of the year’s most acclaimed films. Universal Pictures has cast Miles Teller in their adaptation of the article “The Life and Times of the Stopwatch Gang,” which first appeared at the site Atavist.com. The article and movie tell the true story of a gang of Canadian criminals who robbed over 100 banks without ever having to fire any weapons. The film (whose title will probably be shortened) will be directed by Ruben Fleischer, who remains best known for Zombieland (90% Fresh), but whose last three projects as director (30 Minutes or Less, Gangster Squad) or producer (Two Night Stand, starring Miles Teller) have fared much worse. Fleischer’s recent struggles with finding critical acclaims is why this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, and not because an actor named Teller is going to star in a bank robber movie.1. DISNEY LOGGING BACK IN FOR TRON 3Although news about Disney hiring screenwriter Jesse Wigutow (It Runs in the Family) to work on a third TRON movie did break in late 2012, many people probably took the perceived lack of activity over the last two years to mean that Disney had moved on to greener pastures. After all, it’s not like Disney is lacking for lucrative franchises (the list which currently includes Frozen, Star Wars, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Indiana Jones, Disney Animation and live action remakes). The 2010 sequel TRON: Legacy was a mid-sized hit, with $400 million worldwide (from a budget of $170 million), and a Rotten Tomatometer score of 51%. So, it’s not surprising that people expressed surprise this week when the news broke that TRON 3 is scheduled to start filming this fall, 2015, in Vancouver. Or that TRON: Legacy star Garrett Hedlund and that film’s director Joseph Kosinski are also signed to return for the third film. This will be the third feature film for director Joseph Kosinski, whose second film Oblivion also received a mid-level Rotten Tomatometer score of just 54%.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Turner, casting, archives, Western, critic, video, Christmas, VOD, police, Worst, YouTube, Masterpiece, strong, child's","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/frozen-sequel.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-disney-announces-frozen-sequel"},{"id":"47509199623653","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Second Star Wars Spinoff Will Be a Boba Fett Origin Story","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Second Star Wars Spinoff Will Be a Boba Fett Origin StoryPlus, an endorsed Jimi Hendrix biopic, IT's new Pennywise, and new roles for Natalie Portman, David Oyelowo, Rosamund Pike, Louis C.K., and Christoph Waltz.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 8, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers seven days from the world of film development news, telling us about what movies are being made by whom, starring whom, etc. Included in the mix this time are titles like Captain America: Civil War and Star Wars Anthology 2, biopics about Jimi Hendrix and Karl Rove, and new roles for Kevin James, Natalie Portman, and Daniel Radcliffe.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StorySECOND STAR WARS ANTHOLOGY TO BE BOBA FETT ORIGIN TALEEvery Friday afternoon, the Weekly Ketchup recaps the top stories of the week before. The downside, however, is that sometimes the week’s biggest story actually breaks after the Weekly Ketchup is published. Such was the case last Friday when the news broke that Josh Trank, the director of Chronicle and this summer’s Fantastic Four, had dropped out of directing the second Star Wars Anthology film. At first glance, this might not seem like such a big deal, but it was certainly received with much speculation by the Internet and social media in general, as such talk quickly spread online. This story from The Hollywood Reporter recapped much of what reportedly happened behind the scenes at both 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm that led up to Trank’s departure from the Star Wars project. This project was also confirmed this week to be a Boba Fett origin story, which raised some eyebrows since a good part of George Lucas’ prequels already seemed to be devoted to telling that story (or at least, when the bounty hunter was a little kid). Presumably, the second Star Wars Anthology film, if it remains a Boba Fett origin story, will tell a much later adventure in the bounty hunter’s development. The second Star Wars Anthology film is scheduled for sometime in 2018, after Star Wars: The Force Awakens (12/18/15), Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One (12/16/16), and Star Wars Episode VIII (title likely to change) (5/26/17).Fresh Developments This Week1 PAUL GREENGRASS TO DIRECT OFFICIAL JIMI HENDRIX BIOPICLast year saw the release of Jimi: All is By My Side, from director John Ridley, but the movie was arguably handicapped by the lack of any songs that Jimi Hendrix actually wrote, such as “Purple Haze,” “If 6 was 9,” or “Foxy Lady.” The reason for that was that the estate of the famed, influential rock guitarist did not reach an agreement with Ridley’s film, holding out for a film that they officially approved. Well, the news broke this week that exactly such an agreement appears to have been made. Acclaimed director Paul Greengrass (Captain Phillips, United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum) is now in negotiations with Legendary Pictures to direct a Jimi Hendrix biopic. Legendary has hired screenwriter Scott Silver to start work on the biopic, following his work on the The Fighter and the quasi-Eminem-biopic 8 Mile. The expectation is that the time needed to perfect the script will line up for the Jimi Hendrix project to be Greengrass’ next film after his planned return to the Bourne franchise, which has been scheduled for July 29, 2016.2 NATALIE PORTMAN JOINS EX MACHINA DIRECTOR IN ANNIHILATIONThe science fiction film Ex Machina is one of 2015’s most critically acclaimed genre films, with a Certified Fresh Tomatometer score of 91%. Screenwriter Alex Garland, who made his directorial debut with Ex Machina, isn’t resting on his laurels, as he is already preparing for his next project, which will again be a science fiction film. Natalie Portman is now in early talks with Paramount Pictures to take the lead role in Annihilation, which will be adapted from a novel of the same title by Jeff VanderMeer. Annihilation will tell the story of a team of scientists who venture into a secret zone in the United States where the laws of nature do not apply. The role of Portman’s costar is reportedly being pursued by such actresses as Julianne Moore and Tilda Swinton, but no deals will be made until after Portman signs on for sure. Filming of Annihilation is tentatively expected to start sometime in 2016. (Breaking News: Natalie Portman has also signed with Focus Features to play the young Ruth Bader Ginsberg in the equal rights drama On the Basis of Sex.)3 DANIEL RADCLIFFE AND DANE DEHAAN TO REUNITE IN POLITICAL TRUE STORY YOUNG AMERICANSDaniel Radcliffe and Dane DeHaan costarred together in the 2013 true story drama about a murder case that happened in the midst of the burgeoning beat poetry and literature movement of New York City in the 1940s. Now, both actors are teaming up again with Kill Your Darlings director John Krokidas for another film based on true stories. Their next subjects, however, will be quite different from the likes of Ginsberg, Burroughs, and Kerouac. Dane DeHaan will play the young Karl Rove and Daniel Radcliffe will play the young Lee Atwater in Young Americans (previously titled College Republicans). The movie will tell the story of a cross-country road trip that the two took together in the 1970s when Karl Rove was running for president of the national College Republicans organization. Amanda Seyfried will costar as another young political type who “who secretly threatens to beat the boys at their own game.” Lee Atwater went on to become the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Karl Rove‘s many accomplishments have included serving as Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush. In other news of independent films based on the true stories of future politicians, the leads in the indie romance Southside with You have been cast. Parker Sawyers, who had small roles in Zero Dark Thirty and Kick-Ass 2, and Tika Sumpter (from TV’s Gossip Girl and One Life to Live) have been cast as the young Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson in the film set in Chicago during the late 1980s. Southside with You will be the directorial debut of screenwriter Richard Tanne.4 ROSAMUND PIKE AND DAVID OYELOWO TO STAR IN TRUE ROMANCE A UNITED KINGDOMTwo different movies were announced this week that are based upon true stories involving interracial romance. One of these projects is A United Kingdom, which will tell the true story of Prince Seretse Kharma of Botswana, who became an internationally controversial figure in the 1940s when he married Ruth Williams, a British white woman. David Oyelowo (Selma, Lincoln) has been attached to star as the prince for a while, and this week, he was joined by English actress Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl), who is now in talks to play Ruth Williams. The couple’s son, Ian Kharma, is now the president of Botswana. A United Kingdom is currently seeking a director, and the hope is for filming to start by late 2015. The other similarly-themed romance that made the news this week is called Loving, taking its title from the influential 1967 civil rights case Loving vs Virginia. Joel Edgerton (Warrior, Exodus: Gods and Kings) and Ruth Negga (Raina from TV’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) have been cast as a Virginia couple who were arrested and sentenced to a year in prison for committing the “crime” of interracial marriage. Loving will be the next film for acclaimed director Jeff Nichols, after this fall’s science fiction film Midnight Special. His previous films have included Shotgun Stories, Take Shelter, and Mud.5 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL: CIVIL WAR CAST EXPLODES, SPIDER-MAN DIRECTORS SHORTLIST, MOREWith so many “big, Big, BIG” films in development at Marvel, nearly every week sees multiple stories from the studio. Filming started yesterday on Captain America: Civil War, and so that film had several casting stories this week, mostly involving actors who will be reprising their characters from previous films. It’s frankly probably easier at this point to start focusing on which Marvel characters will not be in Captain America: Civil War (of the Avengers, that appears to be just Hulk and Thor right now). The latest actors to be confirmed for Captain America: Civil War include Paul Bettany (The Vision), Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), William Hurt (General Ross), and Emily VanCamp (Sharon Carter, AKA Agent 13). A completely new addition this week is Martin Freeman (The Hobbit), whose character is being kept secret for now (you can check out my speculation here). There was also a story this week about the shortlist of directors that Sony is considering for the Spider-Man reboot, and the emphasis seemed to be on comedy/indie directors. The list reportedly includes Jonathan Levine (50/50, Warm Bodies), Ted Melfi (St. Vincent), Jason Moore (Pitch Perfect), Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite), and the team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein, who have the reboot of Vacation coming this summer. Finally, Tom Hardy was quoted this week as saying that he would like to play The Punisher (Frank Castle) for Marvel, but of course, the problem with that is that right now, we don’t know if Marvel plans on doing anything with the Punisher anytime soon. Of course, knowing that Tom Hardy wants the job could make it happen…6 LOUIS C.K. AND CHRISTOPH WALTZ ARE BOTH DOING THE DIRECTING/STARRING… THINGA memorable sight gag in L.A. Story involved a seemingly conscious traffic sign, which at one point displayed, “WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO IS DIRECT.” If L.A. Story was remade (or we should say, when it’s remade), the sign might also specify that it wants to direct, write, star, edit, and provide the craft services. Two different stories emerged this week about actors who are planning on becoming directing/starring multi-hyphenates. First off, in the “Louis C.K. directed Pootie Tang?” category is the star of FX’s hit series Louie, the comedian Louis C.K., who has already been a multi-hyphenate for much of his career. Louis C.K. will write, direct, and star in a movie called I’m a Cop, about a volunteer police officer who decides to become a full-time “real” officer following the death of his mother, a highly decorated retired officer herself. Next up, we have Austrian actor Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds, Big Eyes), who will be making his feature film directorial debut with an adaptation of a true crime story called The Worst Marriage in Georgetown. The movie will be adapted from this story in The New York Times Magazine about a murder case involving a man married to a wealthy woman much, much, much older (44 years) than him. The script for The Worst Marriage in Georgetown was adapted by screenwriter David Auburn (Proof, The Lake House).7 THE NEW PENNYWISE THE CLOWN HAS BEEN CAST IN IT (PARTS 1 AND 2)There’s something of a growing mini-wave of remakes of movies or shows that prominently featured Tim Curry. A few months ago, we had the remake of Annie, and FOX TV has announced plans for a TV movie remake of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Hasbro is developing a remake of Clue. We’re still waiting to hear who the new Dr. Frank-n-Furter will be, but this week, we learned who will be wearing the spooky clown makeup of Pennywise in the remake(s) of Stephen King’s IT. And it’s not someone that most people probably ever could have predicted. That’s because Will Poulter is best known for his role in the comedy We’re the Millers (though Poulter was also in Son of Rambow, The Maze Runner, and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader). Will Poulter is also significantly younger (22) than Tim Curry was in 1990 when the ABC mini-series was first made (Curry was 44). Of course, if there’s any role where age probably doesn’t matter a whole lot, it’s one where the actor is basically playing a demon with a face covered with clown makeup. New Line Cinema is producing this adaptation of Stephen King’s massive 1,138 page novel as two separate movies, dividing the story into halves based on the ages of the characters (first as children, and then as reunited adults). Both parts of IT will be directed by Cary Fukunaga, who made his debut with Sin Nombre, and is best known for directing season 1 of HBO’s True Detective. Will Poulter won the role of Pennywise through an audition, after Fukunaga and New Line Cinema had first considered older actors like Ben Mendelsohn (Animal Kingdom) and Mark Rylance, who is currently working with Steven Spielberg as the title character in 2016’s The BFG. New Line Cinema hasn’t yet announced a release date for IT Part 1, but it’s speculated that it could be one of the untitled horror films New Line has announced for 2016.Rotten Ideas of the Week2 KEVIN JAMES AND THE TRUE MEMOIRS OF AN INTERNATIONAL ASSASSINNow that Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is wrapped and in theaters (to an extremely Rotten Tomatometer score of just 6%), Kevin James is preparing for his next “comedy.” James has signed to star in the spy comedy The True Memoirs of an International Assassin, as “a mild-mannered accountant and would-be author who is mistaken for a killer-for-hire when his fictional novel about an international assassin is published as a true story.” The True Memoirs of an International Assassin will be directed by Jeff Wadlow, who has previously directed three movies, none of which received Tomatometer scores above 30% (Cry Wolf, Never Back Down, and Kick-Ass 2). If there’s a bright side to this story, it’s that back in 2009, the script by Jeff Morris made it to the Black List of Unproduced Screenplays, in the same year that The Social Network was #2 on the list, Prisoners was #4, and Cedar Rapids was #5. The (continuing) bad news? The True Memoirs of an International Assassin was indeed on the list, but way, way, way down the list… at #68.1 MARLON WAYANS SPOOFS AGAIN WITH FIFTY SHADES OF BLACKIf there’s a 21st century successor to the legacy of prolific spoof star Leslie Nielsen (R.I.P. 1926-2010), it might just end up being Marlon Wayans. Wayans’ list of spoof movies has thus far included Don’t Be a Menace to South Central…, Scary Movie, Scary Movie 2, Dance Flick, A Haunted House, and A Haunted House 2. The bad news is that in the last 20 years, Marlon Wayans has only starred in two movies with Fresh ratings, and neither (Requiem for a Dream and The Heat) was a spoof comedy. This week, we learned that Marlon Wayans is teaming up once again with the director and producer behind the two Haunted House movies for another spoof movie, based on one of this year’s early hits. Wayans, producer Rick Alvarez, and director Mike Tiddes are the creative trio behind Fifty Shades of Black, a spoof of the E.L. James novel and movie, Fifty Shades of Grey. About the project, Wayans said, “Sex and comedy go hand-in-hand, and I’m looking forward to having fun with this project. It’s amazing when a film of this caliber comes along begging to be made fun of. I’m really happy to be doing what I love with people I love to do it with. That double entendre was intentional.” You know what they say about jokes that you have to explain… Fifty Shades of Black is aiming for a theatrical release in early 2016.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Games, Turner, Writers, lee, ID, rotten, south, TV, motion, Thanksgiving","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/boba-fett.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-second-star-wars-spinoff-will-be-a-boba-fett-origin-story"},{"id":"47509199654378","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Disney Plans Live Action Mulan and Winnie the Pooh","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Disney Plans Live Action Mulan and Winnie the PoohPlus, Tom Hardy is in for three more Mad Max films, and Fox wants to make a Play-Doh movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 3, 2015 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup comes to you just two days after April Fool’s Day, but we promise that we waded through all of the jokes to try to bring you just the stories that we (are pretty sure) are actually real and legitimate. Still, even the “real” stories this week sound pretty fantastic at first glimpse. They include live action Disney remakes of Mulan and Winnie the Pooh, plans for a Play-Doh movie, and plans for an Avengers-style cinematic universe for the Transformers franchise.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryDISNEY PLANNING LIVE ACTION REMAKES OF MULAN AND WINNIE THE POOHLast week on Saturday Night Live, guest star Dwayne Johnson participated in a spoof of Disney’s current wave of live action remakes of their animated classics with a version of Bambi. That was just the beginning, however, of what became a very big week for actual news from Disney about their plans for even more of the same. First, on Monday, there was the news that Disney is planning a live-action remake of the 1998 Chinese epic Mulan. This new Mulan is being produced by Chris Bender and J.C. Spink through their company Benderspink, which has in the past given us such movies as Cats &amp; Dogs, The Butterfly Effect, We’re the Millers, and Horrible Bosses 2. Then, on Thursday (and yes, we’re just skipping over April Fool’s Day), yet another movie was announced when we first heard that Walt Disney Pictures is also developing a live-action adaptation of Winnie the Pooh. Much like they’re doing with their remake of Pete’s Dragon (with indie drector David Lowery), Winnie the Pooh will be written and directed by Alex Ross Perry, who recently had a hit at Sundance with the film Listen Up Philip. In Perry’s new Winnie the Pooh, Christopher Robin will be an adult who returns to the Hundred Acre Wood to have more adventures with Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet, and hopefully, the rest. Mulan and Winnie the Pooh join a growing slate of Disney’s live action adaptations which include The Jungle Book (4/15/16), Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass (5/27/16), Pete’s Dragon (8/12/16), Beauty and the Beast (3/17/17), and Tim Burton’s remake of Dumbo.Fresh Developments This Week1. TOM HARDY SIGNED TO STAR IN THREE MORE MAD MAX MOVIESAs part of the publicity tour leading up to the May 15, 2015 release of Mad Max: Fury Road, actor Tom Hardy made an interesting remark about the franchise. It turns out that Warner Bros has already signed Hardy to star in another three movies as Mad Max beyond just this new reboot. What exactly these three additional movies would be about is currently unknown, but they probably involve a very sandy and dusty post-apocalyptic future where tattooed and/or spike-wearing people jump around on quickly moving vehicles a lot. Mad Max: Fury Road was directed by George Miller, the creator of the original trilogy (and the director of Babe, Happy Feet, and the sequels to both).2. HUGH JACKMAN TO STAR IN FAITH-BASED EPIC APOSTLE PAULAlthough we haven’t seen the massive wave that some predicted, there remains an interest in Hollywood in more faith-based films to appeal to the audience that made hits of The Passion of the Christ and the mini-series The Bible. Some of the bigger such projects have included Noah, Exodus: Gods and Kings, and next year’s remake of Ben-Hur. Warner Bros is now developing another Bible-based project called Apostle Paul, based on the life of the figure also known as Saul of Tarsus, with Hugh Jackman expected to star and produce. Hugh Jackman isn’t the only big star involved, however, as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are also producing. The script is currently being adapted by screenwriter Matt Cook, who will be making his debut this fall with Triple 9 (9/11/15). Saul of Tarsus was not one of Christ’s original disciples, but he became one of Christianity’s earliest and most important figures, as the growing religion spread throughout the Roman Empire. Perhaps not coincidentally, NBC will start airing a sequel to The Bible called A.D.: The Bible Continues on Easter Sunday (4/5/15), which is also set in the earliest days of Christianity’s spread following the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. In other Hugh Jackman news, it was also reported this week that Wolverine 3 (3/3/17) may indeed be the last time that Jackman will play the Marvel superhero, despite a recent quote from Jackman about playing the character for the rest of his life.3. BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING MOVIES: PATRIOTS’ DAY AND BOSTON STRONGA long-running movie industry scenario is that of “duelling movies”, in which competing studios or producers make similar movies at the same time, competing with each other. Unfortunately, the latest example comes from one of the USA’s worst recent tragedies. CBS Films is now fast-tracking a film called Patriots’ Day about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. Patriots’ Day will be based on the first-hand accounts of Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, with Mark Wahlberg reportedly interested in starring as Davis. This puts Patriots’ Day in direct competition with Boston Strong, a Boston Marathon Bombings drama announced in November at 20th Century Fox, with director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House) attached. Boston Strong is expected to be in Boston later this month to film footage of this year’s marathon. It’s possible that both movies could start filming this year.4. THREE MINUTE CONCEPT VIDEO LEADS TO HOT MOVIE DEAL FOR THE LEVIATHANThis story is technically stretched over the last two weeks or so, but most of it did happen late last week just after the previous Ketchup went to press, so we’ll cover it all right here. Two weeks ago, an Irish filmmaker posted a three-minute concept video on YouTube for a science fiction spec script called The Leviathan. The concept is set in the 22nd century, when mankind has achieved faster-than-light-speed travel through the harvesting of eggs from what are essentially massive space whales. Basically, The Leviathan sounds like a cross between Moby Dick and Dune… set even more in outer space. Well, the video proved quickly popular, and led to X-Men franchise producer Simon Kinberg and District 9/Chappie director Neill Blomkamp coming on board as producers. This likewise was quickly followed by the news that 20th Century Fox had picked up the project. The screenplay for The Leviathan is being written by screenwriter Jim Uhls, who is best known for adapting Fight Club and cowriting Jumper.5. VINCENT D’ONOFRIO TO TAKE ON THE MAGNIFICENT SEVENWe may not yet know all seven stars who will be playing the title characters in the remake of The Magnficent Seven, but this week, we did learn who the main villain will be. Vincent D’Onofrio, who will play the Kingpin in Daredevil when it launches next week on Netflix, is now in early talks to play the film’s villain. If he signs, D’Onofrio will join the already cast Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, and Ethan Hawke. That means that there’s still four more members of the titular septet to be cast. Columbia Pictures and MGM have scheduled the Antoine Fuqua-directed remake of The Magnificent Seven for February 13, 2017.6. KILLER CROC CAST IN SUICIDE SQUADNot unlike Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the growing cast of the WB/DC Comics adaptation Suicide Squad is starting to require a score card to keep track of its ensemble. After this week, the Suicide Squad cast now includes at least 12 actors, including Will Smith (Deadshot), Joel Kinnaman (Rick Flagg), Viola Davis (Amanda Waller), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn), and Jared Leto (The Joker). Three new actors joined this week, the first two of which (Scott Eastwood and Raymond Olubowale) are for unknown roles, although there are rumors that Olubowale may have been cast as King Shark. Speaking of humanoid water creatures, the third actor announced this week is former LOST star Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who also becomes the first major actor to make the transition from Marvel’s Cinematic Universe (he was Kurse in Thor: The Dark World) to DC’s new film franchise, as he’s been cast as villain Killer Croc. It’s unknown how big of a role Killer Croc will have in Suicide Squad when it’s released on August 5, 2016. In other DC movie news, Adam West and Burt Ward revealed this week that for the 50th anniversary of their Batman TV series in 2016, they will be starring in a new 90 minute animated movie as Batman and Robin. This animated return to the 1960s version of Batman hasn’t been otherwise clarified (there’s a good chance it might be one of WB’s DC Universe animated movies.Rotten Ideas of the Week3. 20TH CENTURY FOX TO MOLD A MOVIE OUT OF PLAY-DOHAlthough the success of The LEGO Movie may have surprised some, it wasn’t exactly an overnight success, as narrative elements of that movie have been building up since the 1980s, through various sets, and video games, and other LEGO-related projects. There are definitely toy franchises that have narrative threads that might help them become film franchises, but some toys have never really branched out in those ways. One such long-standing toy is Hasbro’s Play-Doh, which since the 1950s has pretty much stayed exactly what it is. Play-Doh is a brightly-colored modelling compound that children can use to make… whatever (an aspect it does share with LEGO). This week, we learned that 20th Century Fox hopes that writer/director Paul Feig can “shape” a movie out of the Play-Doh license. Feig is best known for his movies with Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig like Bridesmaids, The Heat, and the upcoming Ghostbusters project, but he’s also one of the producers on Fox’s upcoming CGI version of Peanuts (11/6/15). Play-Doh now joins other Hasbro properties in various states of development or production, such as the Transformers franchise, Jem and the Holograms (10/23/15), and Magic: The Gathering.2. STEPHEN AMELL: FROM ARROW TO CASEY JONESCanadian actor Stephen Amell shot to TV stardom by playing the street justice vigilante lead character in the CW series Arrow (based on the comic book character Green Arrow). This week, Amell signed on to play another street justice vigilante based on a comic book character. Stephen Amell will costar next summer in the sequel Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 (6/3/16) as Casey Jones, who uses sports equipment as weapons, such as baseball bats and hockey sticks, and wears a hockey mask. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 will be directed by David Green (Earth to Echo).1.&nbsp;TRANSFORMERS SPINOFFS PLANNEDWith four successful Transformers movies now released, Paramount Pictures this week set plans in motion to keep the franchise going for years and movies to come. The studio has done this by talking to screenwriter and producer Akiva Goldsman about setting up a “writer’s room” to incubate ideas for a multi-film Transformers sequel, as well as potential Transformers spinoff movies. Some writers online have interpreted this as meaning Transformers sequels that don’t necessarily, for example, have Optimus Prime or Megatron in them. Goldsman’s involvement in helping find writers and directors for these projects doesn’t necessarily mean that he himself will write any of the films (although he might). His career as screenwriter has included franchise entries like Batman Forever, Batman &amp; Robin, The Da Vinci Code, and Angels &amp; Demons, would-be franchise starters like Lost in Space, I Am Legend, and I, Robot, and acclaimed films like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man. It’s also unclear whether director Michael Bay will be returning for future Transformers entries (Bay is currently preparing to direct the Benghazi movie 13 Hours). The first live action Transformers scored the quartet’s highest Tomatometer score (57%, just shy of Fresh), and the three sequels were all solidly Rotten at 19%, 36%, and 18%, respectively.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Red, Pictures, movies, FOX, dogs, Musical, TV, Tubi, Heroines, YouTube, video, movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mulan-pooh.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-disney-plans-live-action-mulan-and-winnie-the-pooh"},{"id":"47509201206779","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Will Smith, Jared Leto, and Tom Hardy Join DC’s Suicide Squad","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Will Smith, Jared Leto, and Tom Hardy Join DC's Suicide SquadPlus, Bond 24 gets a title, Deadpool and Doctor Strange stars are confirmed, and Chris Pratt might join The Magnificent Sevenby Greg Dean Schmitz | December 5, 2014 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup covers nine days of movie development news (last week’s was published early, pre-Thanksgiving), covering such movies as the James Bond movie Spectre, the comic book adaptations Suicide Squad, Doctor Strange, and Deadpool, and sequels for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and (maybe) Frozen.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryWILL SMITH TO GO ROGUE IN SUICIDE SQUADFollowing in the footsteps of their own star-studded Ocean’s 11 heist franchise, Warner Bros has officially announced the six stars of Suicide Squad (with a few more apparently still to come), the third film in their new DC Cinematic Universe after Man of Steel and the upcoming Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Will Smith will play the assassin Deadshot, Tom Hardy will play the team’s leader Rick Flag, Cara Delevinge will play Enchantress, and Jai Courtney (A Good Day to Die Hard) will play Boomerang (Captain Boomerang in the comics). Those four characters were all founding members of the modern Suicide Squad in the comics, so they’re probably important to group together. Then, there’s Jared Leto and Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street) as The Joker and Harley Quinn; they weren’t members of that original group, which suggests that they may be Suicide Squad‘s antagonists (though this is admittedly just speculation). Superhero teams in the movies often vary from the comics (Black Widow, for example, didn’t join the Avengers in the comics until issue #111, and the Guardians of the Galaxy existed for nearly 40 years without any of the members in the movie). Of course, there were seven original Suicide Squad members, and Joker and Harley Quinn might just have been added to the team to give Suicide Squad more marquee value (especially since Lex Luthor as played by Jesse Eisenberg might possibly involved as well). One of the characters still to be cast is Amanda Waller (sort of DC’s Nick Fury), for whom Oprah Winfrey is reportedly the first choice (because, well, Oprah Winfrey), with The Help stars Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis also being considered. In other WB/DC news, the studio has hired screenwriter Jason Fuchs to work on Wonder Woman for director Michelle MacLaren. Jason Fuchs previously worked on Ice Age: Continental Drift, wrote the studio’s Pan, and is already working on a potential sequel. Warner Bros has scheduled Suicide Squad for August 5, 2016, and Wonder Woman for June 23, 2017.Fresh Developments This Week#1 JAMES BOND VILLAINS SPECTRE TAKE THE TITLE FOR THE 24TH MOVIEWhen the keepers of the keys to the James Bond franchise did a total reboot with the Daniel Craig movies (starting with Casino Royale), the lingering question was when some of the most classic villain elements would make their debuts. Specifically, the criminal organization S.P.E.C.T.R.E. is iconic, featuring such nemeses as Ernst Blofeld, Rosa Klebb and the various numbered henchmen, and clearly influencing the likes of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby when they created S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA for Marvel Comics. This Thursday, a big press event was held to announce the title of the 24th James Bond movie, and the answer was Spectre, complete with a poster image that references the octopus logo of the organization. New cast members revealed this week were Monica Bellucci (The Matrix Reloaded) and Andrew Scott (Moriarty from TV’s Sherlock), and the previously reported Lea Seydoux and Dave Bautista were also confirmed. The name of Christoph Waltz’s character was announced as Oberhauser (a reference to a character from Bond’s past), but it’s still possible this is a cover name (like Ernst Blofeld, as previously rumored). You can read more about various rumors and details in this piece from The Daily Express. Although not mentioned at the press conference, one returning character revealed this week is Mister White from Quantum of Solace, as played by Jesper Christensen. It’s not known how the “Quantum” organization relates to S.P.E.C.T.R.E., but his casting is probably part of that explanation. Spectre will be filmed at locations in Mexico City, Rome, Morocco, and Austria and at Pinewood Studios in London, and will be released on November 6, 2015.&nbsp;#2 INTERSTELLAR DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER NOLAN OFFERED READY PLAYER ONEWarner Bros has reportedly offered Christopher Nolan (Interstellar, The Dark Knight trilogy) the opportunity to direct their adaptation of the popular YA science fiction novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. Ready Player One is set in the dystopian future of 2044 and follows a teenager obsessed with video gaming and role-playing history (especially games from the 1980s like Dungeons and Dragons) who joins in the search for the key to inheriting a huge fortune, a la Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or National Treasure. It’s easy to see some similarities between Ready Player One and Nolan’s previous films (especially Inception), but one would probably expect such a film to be directed by someone more recognized as a geek culture aficionado, like Edgar Wright or Matthew Vaughn. It’s somewhat logical, though, that Warner Bros would acquire the rights to Ready Player One, since they’re also developing a new Dungeons and Dragons movie franchise. The Ready Player One adaptation script was recently completed by screenwriter Zak Penn, who’s built a career on adaptation for Nolan’s comic book competition, with movies like X2, Elektra, X-Men: The Last Stand, The Incredible Hulk, and The Avengers. The next question is, will Christopher Nolan roll a sucessful Save Vs Rotten Idea?&nbsp;#3 FROZEN FEVER TO EXPAND DISNEY’S HIT, BUT WILL THERE BE A FULL SEQUEL?There were a few different stories this week related to the idea of Walt Disney Pictures expanding on the success of their 2013 animated film Frozen. Let’s start with the firmest news, which is that Disney will be attaching an animated short film called Frozen Fever to the March 13, 2015 release of their live action Cinderella. Frozen directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are returning for the short, which will depict Elsa and Kristoff throwing a birthday party for Anna. The short film will also feature a new song written by the first film’s composers. Disney (well, Pixar, specifically) has done these sorts of animated shorts before full sequels in the past, such as with characters from Toy Story, Monsters University, and Cars. As for a full sequel, singer/actress Idina Menzel sort of got caught playing a speculative guessing game which was initially interpreted as an actual announcement. It started with an off-hand comment that a sequel is “in the works,” which was quickly followed by a clarification from Menzel, who said, “You know, I have no idea — I just assumed that because it’s so successful that’s what they’re up to!” Of course, none of this necessarily means she was wrong; Walt Disney Pictures is very much in the sequel/franchise business.&nbsp;#4 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL NEWS WE BASICALLY ALREADY KNEW: DOCTOR STRANGE, DEADPOOLIn the movie development news business, terms like “in negotiations,” “offered,” or “circling” often imply an actor has landed a role (and sometimes that initial story is the only time a specific casting makes the news). For the savviest of studios and publicists, such language offers an opportunity to double-dip, surfacing the same headline twice in different news cycles. Two different Marvel adaptations did exactly that this week, one from Marvel Studios itself, the other from 20th Century Fox. Marvel Studios made the official announcement that Benedict Cumberbatch will indeed star as the Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, which they did not do at their big Phase 3 announcement back in late October (even though the Benedict Cumberbatch news was “reported” just the day before that event). Marvel has scheduled Doctor Strange for release on November 4, 2016. Over at 20th Century Fox, something similar was done with the signing of Ryan Reynolds to star as the fast talking, fourth-wall-breaking mercenary anti-hero Deadpool, which is something most fans have basically presumed was a sure thing for a few years now. Fox has scheduled Deadpool for release on February 6, 2016 (three months before X-Men: Apocalypse on May 27, 2016). In other news about 20th Century Fox adaptations of Marvel characters, The Fantastic Four here at Rotten Tomatoes attracted a fair amount of notice because of the similarities between its recently revealed premise (their powers now come from “an alternate and dangerous universe”) and the rebooted origin story from Marvel’s “Ultimate” reboot of Fantastic Four. 20th Century Fox has scheduled The Fantastic Four for August 7, 2015.&nbsp;#5 ACT NOT LIKE THOU ART UNIMPRESSED THUSLY: SHAKESPEARE COMEDY PLANNED FOR WILL FERRELLIn a week when Sony Pictures experienced a lot of bad news, including alleged insider comments about one of their stars, a promising new comedy venture was announced for one of their most successful stars, Will Ferrell. Sony Pictures has acquired a comedy pitch for Ferrell set in “the intense, competitive world inside a Shakespearean theater company.” Inappropriate flubbing of Elizabethan jargon and/or famous Shakespeare quotes? Will Ferrell not quite fitting appropriately in tights, doublet, and ruff? I probably just came up with 80% of what we’ll see in the first trailer. “All the world’s a stage, and we are merely… [INSERT WILL FERRELL IMPROV SHOUTING HERE!!!].” This project currently lacks a title, a screenwriter, a director, and certainly a release date.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 DISNEY AND SONY NOW RACING TO PRODUCE ROBIN HOOD MOVIESThere’s a very, very old and storied tradition in Hollywood in which studios compete with each other to produce films based on nearly identical properties or concepts, with the eventual movies ending up in theaters very near each other. The concept is called “Dueling Movies,” and if you ever wondered about the proximity of movies like Deep Impact/Armageddon, Olympus Has Fallen/White House Down, or Mirror Mirror/Snow White and the Huntsman, you have been wary enough to notice this unabashed trend. We’ve known for since October that Sony Pictures was developing a “cinematic universe” (a la The Avengers) based on the characters of Robin Hood and his various Merry Men (Friar Tuck, Little John, Will Scarlet, etc). Well, a ticking clock just appeared for those projects this week, as Walt Disney Pictures has acquired a spec script also based on Robin Hood called Nottingham &amp; Hood, which is reportedly in the vein of Pirates of the Caribbean. The problem with both of these stories (which potentially add up to half a dozen different Robin Hood movies) is that, in the last twenty years, we’ve already had a few attempts at reviving the character. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe both tried it, and while either movie was a flat out flop, exactly, this writer is guessing some people have forgotten either movie had even been made. Is Robin Hood a story people still care about? Can any modern Robin Hood movie ever top Errol Flynn?&nbsp;#3 JONAH HILL AND MILES TELLER EYE WAR COMEDY ARMS AND THE DUDESA lot can change in the time it takes a film to go from concept to development to production, depending on studio politics, genre or actor popularity, or just simple scheduling reasons. For example, at Warner Bros, there is a crime/military/war comedy called Arms and the Dudes, which is based on the true story of two “stoners” who ended up becoming arms dealers for the U.S. government, providing weapons to be used in Afghanistan. At one time, not too long ago, the two stars would have been Jesse Eisenberg and Shia LaBeouf. This week, we learned that the stars are now possibly going to be Jonah Hill and The Spectacular Now and Whiplash star Miles Teller. Jesse Eisenberg reportedly dropped out of the project due to the time commitment to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and (possibly) Suicide Squad, in which Eisenberg would portray Lex Luthor. Arms and the Dudes will be directed by Todd Phillips as his next comedy film after finishing up The Hangover trilogy last year. Phillips also directed Old School, Starsky &amp; Hutch, School for Scoundrels, and Due Date, and it’s the low Tomatometer scores for his last three films which landed this story in the “Rotten Idea” category this week.&nbsp;#2 CHRIS PRATT MIGHT PLAY LEGENDARY OUTLAW (AGAIN?) IN THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (AGAIN?)The ramifications of Hollywood’s fascination a few years ago with developing reboots and remakes is still shaking out as the projects begun in 2008 to 2012 continue to either work their way towards production or get put into turnaround. One of the studios central to that whole trend has been MGM, who you have to thank for such remakes as Red Dawn, Carrie, Fame, The Taking of Pelham 123, and the upcoming remakes of Poltergeist and Ben-Hur. On one hand, the argument could be made that one of the things MGM has going for it is their massive catalog of past successes. On the other hand, did anyone really have an overwhelming yen for retreads of Red Dawn, RoboCop, or Hercules? That’s basically the vibe we also get from MGM’s long-in-development plans to remake The Magnificent Seven (which was itself a Western genre remake of Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai). This week, we learned that Chris Pratt, hot off Guardians of the Galaxy and the Jurassic World teaser trailer, is now in early talks to join Denzel Washington in the Magnificent Seven remake. On one hand, we have to admit that Pratt’s involvement in this remake is a second intriguing move (Denzel’s involvement was the first). But we’re still talking about a remake of a well respected remake of a pretty much certified cinematic classic. There are plenty of flawed movies just sitting out there waiting to be done right. MGM’s new Magnificent Seven will be directed by Antoine Fuqua (King Arthur, Shooter, Olympus Has Fallen).&nbsp;#1 EARTH TO ECHO DIRECTOR TAKES ON TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES 2Soon after this summer’s reboot of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles opened up very strongly against Guardians of the Galaxy, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced plans for a sequel to be released on June 3, 2016. This week, we learned a few more details about that sequel. First off, we now know that Dave Green is in talks to direct, after making his debut with Earth to Echo, which received a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 48 percent. One of the franchise’s producers, Andrew Form, also dropped the news this week that for the sequel, they are hoping to include three more characters: the crime fighter Casey Jones, and the evolved animal bad guys Bebop (the pig man) and Rocksteady (the rhino man). The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles received a Rotten Tomatometer score in August of just 22 percent.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"TV, Britbox, Carpet, universe","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/will-smith-deadshot.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-will-smith-jared-leto-and-tom-hardy-join-dcs-suicide-squad"},{"id":"47509201201656","title":"Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Stories of 2014","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Stories of 2014\n                        \n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 26, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nFew industries enjoy taking really, really, really long extended holiday vacations quite like Hollywood. So when we get to this time of the year, there’s really not much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss, especially not in a weekly column which normally includes 10 different stories. So, this week and next, we’re going to instead review 12 of the year’s top stories, presented to you in monthly chronology. The year-in-review begins with the “Fresh Developments” which here also serve (mostly) as the “Top Stories” of the year.  Our retrospective begins with one of the year’s biggest stories, which was…\n\n\n\n&nbsp;Top Story of the Year\n\t\nGHOSTBUSTERS TO GET FEMALE REBOOT \n\nIn some years, it’s very clear which story is the biggest of the year (such was the case in 2013 with Ben Affleck as Batman). Much in the same way that 2014’s box office was sort of “middling,” the movie development news stories of 2014 lacked that single one story which stood out so well. We ultimately decided upon what was one of the most surprising stories, which is that Sony Pictures has decided to turn the long-in-development third Ghostbusters movie into an all-female reboot of the franchise. One of the details that emerged recently amidst all of the leaked e-mails from the hacking of Sony (because of The Interview) was confirmation from director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, The Heat) that his film will indeed be a “hard reboot” (not a sequel pretending to be a reboot), set in a very different world than the original film was (if you read this story, you’ll find out several details about his version). As for who the four female leads will be in the new Ghostbusters, we still don’t have any confirmed casting, but actresses who were in Bridesmaids are often described as being amongst the front runners (namely, Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, and Rebel Wilson), with the idea being that it would be fun to see Ghostbusters be a Bridesmaids reunion. Before one scoffs at that premise too much, consider that the original Ghostbusters was itself a partial reunion of Meatballs (same director, and two of the same stars, Harold Ramis and Bill Murray). Sony is expected to schedule the Ghostbusters reboot for either 2016 or 2017, so there’s a good chance that this time next year, we will know much more.\n\n\n\n\t\nJANUARY: JENNIFER LAWRENCE TO STAR IN THE MIRACLE MOP BIOPIC JOY\n\nIf Jennifer Lawrence had never even met director David O. Russell, much less starred in two of his movies (American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook), there’s little doubt that she would still be a major young star today. Those collaborations did, however, give Jennifer Lawrence her first Academy Award (Best Actress for Silver Linings Playbook) and her first two Golden Globes. David O. Russell is a director who very much believes in working repeatedly with a recurring cast of actors and actresses, so it shouldn’t have come as a surprise that Jennifer Lawrence would also be in his next film (it’s still big news, though).  What is surprising is that the film called Joy is a biopic about the woman, Joy Mangano, who invented the Miracle Mop. Two other actors who appeared in both Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle, Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper, are also expected to have roles in Joy. Filming starts in February on Joy, and the film is already scheduled for Christmas Day, 2015.  Meanwhile, in somewhat related news, later in the year, a biopic about Tupperware was also announced, with Sandra Bullock attached to star.\n\n\n\t\nFEBRUARY: KATE WINSLET, AARON PAUL, AND MANY MORE TO STAR IN TRIPLE NINE\n\nUnlike big tentpole hopefuls like superhero movies and animated family films, “prestige films” from acclaimed directors usually have much shorter development lifetimes. For that reason, a few of the movies in this particular year-in-review have release dates in 2015 (or in 2016). One of those is the heist film Triple Nine, about a group of police officers blackmailed into committing a crime, using the “999” code for “officer down” as a cover for the heist. Based just on that premise, Triple Nine might not seem particularly unusual or worthy of including as one of the year’s top stories. Director John Hillcoat (The Road, Lawless, The Proposition) does not, however, have an average filmography. There is a common notion in Hollywood these days that John Hillcoat is a director on the verge of mainstream success and popularity, and the cast he’s attracted for Triple Nine suggests this. His film’s cast will include: Casey Affleck (in the lead role), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Gal Gadot (2017’s Wonder Woman), Woody Harrelson, Anthony Mackie (Captain America: The Winter Soldier), Aaron Paul (TV’s Breaking Bad), Norman Reedus (TV’s The Walking Dead), and Kate Winslet. Triple Nine is currently scheduled for September 11, 2015.\n\n\n\t\nMARCH: PIXAR ANNOUNCES THE INCREDIBLES 2, CARS 3, AND TOY STORY 4\n\nAmong animated film fans (and especially fans of Pixar), a subject for much debate concerns sequels (versus original stories). The pros and cons are similar as those about sequels in general, but it’s a concentrated debate for a company that only produces on average, about one movie a year. Pixar’s next two films, both currently scheduled for 2015, will be original stories (Inside Out on 6/19/15 and The Good Dinosaur on 11/25/15), but this year, we learned that their four films after that will likely all be sequels. We had already known, going into 2014 about the Finding Nemo sequel Finding Dory (6/17/16), but in March, we learned that a sequel to The Incredibles and a third Cars movie are both in development. And then, last month, Disney also announced that Toy Story 4 has been scheduled for release on June 16, 2017.\n\n\n\t\nAPRIL: STEVEN SPIELBERG’S NEXT TWO FILMS: ST. JAMES PLACE AND THE BFG\n\nAs frequently happens when director Steven Spielberg is in between films, early 2014 saw a flurry of speculation about what the his next film might be after the 2012 release of Lincoln (and his departures from almost directing both Interstellar and American Sniper). Among the films that made the news that way (and which remain in development) were the Hernan Cortez biopic Montezuma, the dramatic true story The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara, and a remake of West Side Story. In April, within a few days of each other, we instead found out two entirely different films which Steven Spielberg will be directing next. First, there is the Cold War true story about the legal case of U2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers, which we now know is called St. James Place. The Coen Bros worked on the script, and frequent Spielberg collaborator Tom Hanks will star in St. James Place, along with Amy Ryan and Alan Alda. Walt Disney Pictures has scheduled St. James Place for October 16, 2015. Nearly concurrently, Steven Spielberg is also directing the Roald Dahl adaptation The BFG. That children’s fantasy about a giant helping a young girl and the Queen of England against a group of evil giants will be released in 2016.\n\n\n\t\nMAY: THE COEN BROTHERS TAKE ON THE GOLDEN AGE OF HOLLYWOOD WITH HAIL, CAESAR!\n\nThis time last year, the Coen Brothers were receiving acclaim for Inside Llewyn Davis, about the folk music scene of the early 1960s. For their next film, Joel and Ethan Coen will focus on another era of entertainment history, and this time, it’s one presumably particularly close to their hearts: the final days of the golden age of Hollywood in the 1950s. That film will be called Hail, Caesar! and it will feature a star-studded ensemble, including George Clooney, Josh Brolin (as real life “fixer” Eddie Mannix), Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, Scarlett Johansson, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and Channing Tatum.  Universal Pictures has announced a release date of February 5, 2016, but it’s very possible that this will be a wide release following a awards-qualifying run in select cities in December, 2015.\n\n\n\t\nJUNE: JAKE GYLLENHAAL IGNITES DEMOLITION FOR WILD DIRECTOR\n\nAfter helping Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon develop career-redefining roles in Dallas Buyers Club and Wild, director Jean-Marc Vallee will next work with Jake Gyllenhaal on a film called Demolition.  Written by Bryan Sipe, Demolition is “the story of an investment banker struggling to understand his emotional disconnect after the tragic death of his wife [to be played by Naomi Watts]. He begins to tear apart his life in a effort to see where he went wrong and is ultimately rescued by a woman he meets in a chance encounter.” And then, hilarity ensues (…or not). Presumably, the next step would be to cast the female lead. We also learned this year that Jean-Marc Vallee is developing a Janis Joplin biopic, but that film is probably years from being made.\n\n\n\t\nJULY: LEONARDO DICAPRIO SEEKS REVENGE ON TOM HARDY IN THE REVENANT\n\nAs noted earlier, many of the most “fresh” stories of 2014 will be in theaters in late 2015, potentially in awards contention. One such film is The Revenant, the next film from acclaimed director Alejandro González Iñárritu, whose Birdman, or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is itself currently a big awards season contender. The Revenant is set in frontier America, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the title character, who seeks vengeance on three other fur trappers who rob him and leave him to die after he’s been mauled by a bear.  Tom Hardy will play one of the fur trappers who committed the evil deed.  20th Century Fox has scheduled The Revenant for release on Christmas Day, 2015.\n\n\n\t\nSEPTEMBER: MATT DAMON TO RETURN AS JASON BOURNE\n\nThis year, Jeremy Renner has been filming two big new sequels in the form of Avengers: Age of Ultron, and then Mission: Impossible 5, along with Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames. One sequel, however, that Renner won’t be filming any time is the The Bourne Legacy 2, which had been scheduled for July 16, 2016. Oh, there’s still going to be a Bourne sequel scheduled for that date (just not that one). Earlier this autumn, Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass started negotiations with Universal Pictures to return for a fourth movie about Jason Bourne, following their collaboration on the two sequels The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). The goal is indeed to get the film ready in time for that 7/16/16 release date. The Bourne Legacy sequel with Jeremy Renner (and director Justin Lin) remains in development… for some later date (especially now that Justin Lin is attached to direct Star Trek 3). We also found out this year that Paul Greengrass is developing a remake of George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984.\n\n\n\t\nOCTOBER: A MONTH OF BIG SUPERHERO ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR DC AND MARVEL\n\nWe’re used to thinking of July as the month for big superhero movie announcements, since that’s when San Diego Comic-Con is. This year, however, all of that really happened in October. First, Warner Bros and DC Comics announced 10 movies for 2016 to 2020, all as part of a Justice League cinematic universe (that started with Man of Steel). Those films included Suicide Squad, two Justice League films, and solo movies for Wonder Woman, the Flash, Aquaman, Shazam, and Cyborg. Around that same time, we started to hear about Marvel’s plans, which started with Robert Downey Jr. being signed to appear in Captain America: Civil War (adapting the crossover event in which Iron Man was a central figure). It was two weeks later, however, that Marvel Studios had their own big event, announcing their own two part team movies Avengers: Infinity War (Parts 1 and 2), along with Inhumans, and solo movies for Black Panther (starring Chadwick Boseman) and Captain Marvel.\n\n\n\t\nNOVEMBER: WONDER WOMAN GETS WOMAN WONDER DIRECTOR\n\nOnce Warner Bros confirmed that they would indeed finally produce a live-action Wonder Woman movie, we started hearing a lot about their goal being to hire a female director for the job. It was in November that we heard that the job was likely to go to Michelle McClaren, who has developed a strong body of work on television.  Specifically, McClaren’s filmography includes four episodes of Game of Thrones, three episodes of The Walking Dead (including a rather important season two episode), and a whopping 11 episodes of Breaking Bad (including four from season five with some of the most important plot beats). For her work on Breaking Bad, Michelle McClaren has been Emmy-nominated twice as director, and won two Emmys as producer. There was more news about Michelle McClaren developing Wonder Woman two weeks later.\n\n\n\t\nDECEMBER: READY PLAYER ONE ADAPTATION ATTRACTS SHORTLIST OF POPULAR FILM DIRECTORS\n\nAdmittedly, December is always sort of a short and slow news month, so we were limited on the stories we could choose for this slot. One particularly interesting story, though, was the idea that Warner Bros is hoping to attract director Christopher Nolan (Interstellar, Inception, Memento) to work on their adaptation of the science fiction novel Ready Player One. Of course, this didn’t (and doesn’t) mean that Christopher Nolan will actually take the job, but it was the start of an indication that WB has very ambitious plans for what will be a movie about a teenager in the future obsessed with 1970s and 1980s role-playing games and video games (merged with a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory type premise). Soon after, Ain’t It Cool News reported that the longer director wishlist for Ready Player One includes Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit), Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), Matthew Vaughn (X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass), and at the top of the list, Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?), whose films themselves influenced the novel. We expect to learn who will actually nab this now highly anticipated film in 2015.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"romance, Television, fast, finale, lord, kong, hispanic, CMT, FXX, mutant, hidden, Fox, BBC","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"yearly-ketchup-the-freshest-stories-of-2014"},{"id":"47509202753029","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Prometheus 2 Will Not Have Xenomorphs","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Prometheus 2 Will Not Have Xenomorphs\n                        Plus, new roles for Mark Ruffalo, Key &amp; Peele, Matt Damon, JGL, and a few GoT stars.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 26, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup covers over ten stories from the “film development” angle, including the newest reports about the science fiction sequels Prometheus 2 and Star Trek 3, and the two zombie movies featuring Game of Thrones cast members.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nNO XENOMORPH ALIENS IN PROMETHEUS 2\n\nThrough most of the development process leading up to the 2012 release of the science fiction film Prometheus, there was talk online about how the film connected to Ridley Scott’s Alien (and the resulting franchise). The answer ended up being, “yes,” the movie was indeed a prequel to the Alien franchise, including an appearance by the iconic black and oozing “xenomorph” aliens (two years later, we’re going to say that’s not a spoiler anymore). There could reasonably be an expectation that the monsters could appear again. However, this week, director Ridley Scott remarked that this will not be the case, saying, “The beast is done. Cooked.” Continuing, Scott remarked, “There’s only so much snarling you can do. I think you’ve got to come back with something more interesting. And I think we’ve found the next step. I thought the Engineers were quite a good start.” 20th Century Fox had previously scheduled Prometheus 2 for March 4, 2016, but that date has now been given to Tim Burton’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children instead. Ridley Scott is continuing to develop Prometheus 2, along with a sequel to Blade Runner, which now appears more likely to be his next film after The Martian (which Michael Pena is now in talks to join). Finally, in other news regarding the cast of Prometheus, Guy Pearce made the news this week because he will be playing author F. Scott Fitzgerald in the biopic Genius, about famed Scribner editor Max Perkins. Dominic West (from HBO’s The Wire) has also been cast as author Ernest Hemingway, joining a cast which also includes Colin Firth (as Max Perkins), Nicole Kidman, Jude Law, and Laura Linney.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 WILL KIRK AND SPOCK REUNITE ONE LAST TIME IN STAR TREK 3?\n\nWhen Leonard Nimoy (now 83) confirmed earlier this year that he is suffering from CPOD, and is now wheelchair bound, it was a grim reminder that even our most iconic figures are but truly mortal. This week, we learned of a potential plan to give us one last hurrah for Nimoy’s character of Spock in the upcoming sequel Star Trek 3 (title likely to change). If this report proves accurate (and other factors pan out), we might get to see James T. Kirk and his Vulcan friend Spock on screen together one last time. Reportedly, the Star Trek 3 script “includes a scene that reteams Shatner and Nimoy onscreen as Kirk and Spock for the first time in canon since 1991’s Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.” There had previously been talk of Shatner also costarring in the first Star Trek reboot film (but eventually, only Spock appeared in the film). Star Trek 3 is expected to start filming sometime in the next year.  Meanwhile, William Shatner is currently scheduling a 2014-2015 tour called “Shatner’s World“, which would have to be scheduled around the film, presumably. In related news, director/writer Roberto Orci dropped out of executive producing the Power Rangers reboot this week, to allow more time to focus on his directing of Star Trek 3.\n\n\n\t\n#2 SHREK/NARNIA DIRECTOR TAKES ON NAZI GERMANY WITH BREATH OF BONES (AND OTHER KIDS MOVIES!)\n\nOne of the most surprising ways that generations of creative people, and their audiences, have processed the horrors of World War II is through the use of “Nazi’s” as villains in stories and films. The most classic example of this was of course, Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was a “four quadrant” movie which thrilled children (of the right age) as well as adults. This week, director Andrew Adamson, whose filmography includes the first two movies of both the Shrek and The Chronicles of Narnia film franchises, announced just such a project. Adamson is attached to direct an adaptation of the Dark Horse Comics mini-series Breath of Bones: A Tale of the Golem. This World War II fantasy adventure tells the story of a young boy who must help build a Jewish creature called a Golem to help defend his village from an approaching German occupying force.  The idea of a high profile Hollywood movie based upon the mythology of the Golem has been a possibility in different forms for years now. The project that got closest was the adaptation of Michael Chabon’s The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay, which included an adventure story involving the “Golem of Prague.” Mattel also made the news this week with their plans for a feature film based upon the toy franchise Ever After High, about the teenage children of famous fairy tale characters. This Ever After High project is being developed by Chernin Entertainment, the production company which gave us Oblivion, the two most recent Planet of the Apes movies, and Ridley Scott’s upcoming Biblical epic, Exodus: Gods and Kings. Finally, Walt Disney Pictures also this week acquired the rights to the children’s series Floors, which will be adapted by screenwriter Jason Filardi (Bringing Down the House).\n\n\n\t\n#3 THIS WEEK IN GAME OF THRONES CASTING: PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES (AND OTHERS)\n\nEven though filming is well underway for season 5 of Game of Thrones, several cast members are currently lining up work (probably because their characters are either not needed, or not at the locations scheduled for upcoming film). In particular, this week, there was a lot of zombie news. Two members of House Lannister, Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) and Lena Headey (Cersei Baratheon), have joined the adaptation of the “horror mashup” novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, written by Seth Grahame-Smith and Jane Austen (sort of).  Dance and Headey join a growing cast which also includes Lily James, Sam Riley, Douglas Booth, Bella Heathcoate, Jack Huston, Matt Smith, and Suki Waterhouse. Screen Gems also stepped up this week to distribute the film in the USA. Cersei’s quasi-daughter-in-law Margaery Tyrell (AKA Natalie Dormer) also made zombie news this week by signing on to star in the independent horror film Patient Zero. The film will depict an outbreak of a form of rabies (ala 28 Days Later), and a patient who is able to speak the “language” of the afflected zombie-like people. Finally, in Game of Thrones star casting news which has nothing to do with zombies (that we know of), Peter Dinklage signed on this week to star in an early 20th Century Texas-set mystery thriller called The Thicket. Peter Dinklage will star as a “a crafty bounty hunter named Shorty” who teams up with “a grave-digging alcoholic son of an ex-slave, and a street-smart prostitute” to help a young man pursuing a killer called “Cut Throat Bill” who has kidnapped his sister.\n\n\n\t\n#4 COMEDY TEAM KEY &amp; PEELE REVEAL THEIR MULTIPLE FILM PLANS\n\nThe world is still waiting on the big, successful comedy movie which will launch the comedy team of Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, AKA “Key &amp; Peele,” into the next level of their cross-platform comedy careers. This week, the two are guest editing Entertainment Weekly, and that was an opportunity for them to talk about their various plans.  First up, there’s their project at Paramount Pictures, which will be an adaptation of their “Substitute Teacher” sketch character, as seen on their Comedy Central series.  They’re also still working on the previously announced reboot of Police Academy, a mystery project with Judd Apatow, and most suprisingly, a horror film for Darko Entertainment which Jordan Peele hopes to direct.\n\n\n\t\n#5 MARK RUFFALO TO INVESTIGATE CHURCH SCANDALS IN SPOTLIGHT\n\nFilming has started in Boston (before moving on to Toronto) on the drama Spotlight, about the 2001 probe by the Boston Globe’s special investigation team into allegations of systemic cover ups by the Boston Archdiocese of sexual abuse of children by priests. This week, we learned that the drama’s stars will be Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and Stanley Tucci, along with Billy Crudup, Brian d’Arcy James, Jamey Sheridan, and John Slattery. Spotlight will be directed, and was cowritten, by Tom McCarthy, whose films as director have included The Visitor and Win Win.\n\n\t\n#6 PATRICK WILSON AND MATTHEW FOX JOIN WESTERN HORROR FILM BONE TOMAHAWK\n\nWe’ve been hearing about a “western horror” film called Bone Tomahawk (which involves cannibal trogdolytes, by the way) for a few years now. This week, Patrick Wilson (Watchmen, The Conjuring) and Matthew Fox (LOST) joined the already cast Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins (Cabin in the Woods). Bone Tomahawk will be the directorial debut of novelist and screenwriter S. Craig Zahler.\n\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 WILL MATT DAMON AND BRYAN CRANSTON HELP BUILD THE GREAT WALL?\n\nIt’s not something that people in Hollywood are likely to love talking about, but there is a long-standing non-PC tradition in movie storytelling which the folks at TV Tropes have memorialized as the “Mighty Whitey.” Broadly explained, the Mighty Whitey is a Caucasian character who travels to foreign lands, and generally excels there better than those native to the region. Indiana Jones, Lawrence of Arabia, Crocodile Dundee, Avatar, and Apocalypse Now are all examples of this trope.  Having introduced that concept, let’s now talk about the casting of a new epic called The Great Wall, which, as you can guess from the title, is the story of how the Great Wall of China was constructed. Keep in mind how many “Caucasian men” were probably involved, and also that westerners didn’t first report seeing the Great Wall until the 16th century. Ready? Okay, so in two different stories this week, we learned that two of the potential stars of The Great Wall are Matt Damon and Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston. If they both sign on, this will be their second film as costars, after 2011’s Contagion (although they didn’t really work together much on that one). This is obviously not a story about what horrible actors either one is, but… come on.  This adventure epic promises to reveal “the mystery behind why the Great Wall was built, and the secrets hidden beneath its stones.” We also know from this article a few months ago that the film is set in the 15th century (a century before the first Westerners ever reported even seeing the Wall, which was built centuries earlier). The Great Wall will be directed by Zhang Yimou, a former critical darling who’s had a tough time on the Tomatometer since Curse of the Golden Flower in 2006.\n\n\n\t\n#2 JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT MIGHT BE OLIVER STONE’S EDWARD SNOWDEN\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt is one of Hollywood’s promising stars on the rise, and any new project for him is worth keeping an optimistic eye on. Having said that, this week’s news involves a director whose Tomatometer in recent years has been taking a bit of a critical beating. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is now considered the top candidate to play NSA/CIA/DIA leaker Edward Snowden in Olver Stone’s untitled biopic. One reason the title is not yet announced is that the film will be an adaptation of two different sources: the novel Time of the Octopus (about Snowden’s time in Russia), and the non-fiction book, The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World’s Most Wanted Man. If a deal can be reached with JGL, filming of the Edward Snowden biopic is expected to start in Munich, Germany, in December, 2014.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also still working on an adaptation of the Vertigo/DC Comics character Sandman for Warner Bros.  In somewhat related news, we learned this week that the 10+ years of development for the Vertigo adaptation Y: The Last Man came to an end this week (at New Line Cinema, anyway). People trying to figure out WB and DC’s (parent companies of both parties involved here) plans for the next few years have one less project to keep track of.\n\n\n\t\n#1 DIVERGENT STAR MILES TELLER TRASH TALKS DIVERGENT (WHILE PREPARING FOR THE SEQUEL)\n\nThere’s actually a second story related to Divergent here that we’ll get into soon, but the big news for fans (or otherwise) of the YA franchise came to us via one of the movie’s stars, Miles Teller (who’s also going to be Reed Richards in the reboot of The Fantastic Four). Speaking about filming Divergent, Miles Teller said that he felt “dead inside,” and that he told his agent, “This sucks.” The reason all of this is rather awkward is that Miles Teller is still signed to return for the sequel Insurgent (as one of the franchise’s villains).  So, of course, he sort of kind of apologized. So, what’s changed in between Divergent and Insurgent?  Director Neil Burger, who directed the first film, but won’t be returning for the sequel, announced a new project this week. Burger signed on this week to direct All the Old Knives, an adaptation of an upcoming CIA thriller novel. Neil Burger’s past credits have included the Fresh films Limitless, The Illusionist, and Interview with the Assassin, so hopefully, this project will correct his trends.  Let’s call this one a retroactive “Rotten Idea of the Week,” for a movie we now know to be Rotten.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"mission:","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Prometheus-2-Will-Not-Have-Xenomorphs"},{"id":"47509202745857","title":"Weekly Ketchup: My Little Pony Movie Coming in 2017","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: My Little Pony Movie Coming in 2017Plus, a possible Quicksilver movie, and new roles for Steve Carell, Tom Hardy, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Ethan Hawke.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 24, 2014 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers movie development news stories about such movies as My Little Pony, X-Men: Apocalypse, a Cabin Fever remake, and a sequel for indie classic Welcome to the Dollhouse.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryMY LITTLE PONY MOVIE IN 2017There’s been a lot of talk in the press lately about an upcoming surge in superhero movies. Although it pales in comparison, the argument could also be made that “toy movies” are also on an upswing. Warner Bros recently confirmed plans for annual LEGO movies for 2016, 2017, and 2018. New sequels in the G.I. Joe and Transformers franchises are planned. New movies based on Monster High (10/7/16), Trolls (11/4/16), Barbie, Masters of the Universe, and View-Master are also all on the way or in development. One of the key companies behind this mini-trend is Hasbro (home to G.I. Joe, Transformers, and Ouija). This week, it was revealed that another toy franchise Hasbro is now developing as an animated movie is My Little Pony, for release in 2017. In addition to toys, My Little Pony has also been adapted as TV specials, an animated DTV movie, and four different animated TV shows. The animated My Little Pony movie will be produced by a new company called Allspark Pictures, which will be making its feature film debut with the Jem and the Holograms movie scheduled for October 23, 2015.Fresh Developments This Week#1 TOM HARDY WANTED FOR TITLE VILLAIN IN X-MEN: APOCALYPSEMost actors who dip their toe into the superhero movie water are “one and done,” at least one character. There are obviously examples, however, of actors who have played more than one character, with the most famous example being Chris Evans, who played Human Torch in two Fantastic Four movies before going on to also be Marvel’s Captain America. If various people in Hollywood have their way, Tom Hardy is another actor who will have more than play more than just Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. Last week, there was a story that Hardy was wanted by Warner Bros to star in the super villain ensemble Suicide Squad (and he’s also one of the many talked about for Doctor Strange). And now, this week, the news came out that 20th Century Fox is hoping to recruit Tom Hardy to play the title villain in X-Men: Apocalypse (5/27/16). Of course, that doesn’t mean that talks have officially started between Hardy and Fox yet, and it definitely doesn’t mean at this point that Hardy will take the role. Apocalypse is one of those comic book villains who is less famous to mainstream audiences (now), but the gist is that Apocalypse is a mutant so powerful that he’s existed for thousands of years. We got our first glimpse at the young Apocalypse during the credits of this year’s X-Men: Days of Future Past.&nbsp;#2 STEVE CARELL TO BE SURROUNDED BY IDIOTS IN I.Q. 83Some movies take a really, really, long time to get made. One such example is an adaptation of the Arthur Herzog novel I.Q. 83, which has been in development at first DreamWorks, and then Paramount, since the mid-1990s. This week, the project got a new breath of fresh air as Steve Carell is now attached to star, with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman hired to do a page 1 rewrite. Although Charlie Kaufman’s career has slowed down a bit in recent years, his past filmography as screenwriter includes Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Steve Carell will star in I.Q. 83 as a scientist responsible for an outbreak which causes the afflicted to become drastically less intelligent, and it’s a race against time to find a cure as the scientist feels himself starting to also lose his intelligence. Anyone who’s seen Steve Carell play Brick Tamland can sort of guess what that might look like.&nbsp;#3 THIS WEEK IN DC COMICS: WONDER WOMAN, SUICIDE SQUADNow that Warner Bros and DC Comics have confirmed plans for ten movies in the five years from 2016 to 2020, we can probably expect the number of news stories about those various films to increase in the months to come. One of the stories that made the cycle this week was really a tiny mention, but many writers took it and ran. The entirety of the “story” came to us in just the nine words that make up, “seeking a female helmer for Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman.” That was enough, however, for various sites to start running stories listing the various female directors who could direct a movie like Wonder Woman, and invariably, most of these stories started and ended with Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break, The Hurt Locker). Other possibilities include Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight, Red Riding Hood), Lexi Alexander (Punisher: War Zone), Patty Jenkins (Monster), Kimberly Peirce (Boys Don’t Cry), and actresses-turned-directors Jodie Foster and Angelina Jolie. Late this week, there was also a story about Warner Bros possibly being in talks with Jesse Eisenberg about reprising his upcoming role as Lex Luthor in the supervillain ensemble movie Suicide Squad. If this report pans out, it will represent a significant shift from the comics. Although there have been over a hundred different villains who have been members of Suicide Squad in the comics, Lex Luthor wasn’t one of them.&nbsp;#4 GRETA GERWIG MIGHT STAR IN WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE SEQUELOne of the trends in cinema that will always be remembered historically about the 1990s is that it was a time when a new generation of “indie” filmmakers burst onto the scene (some of whom are now industry veterans and Academy Award winners). One of the most polarizing films (and filmmakers) from right in the middle of the decade was Welcome to the Dollhouse, from director Todd Solondz. Now, as the 20th anniversary of Welcome to the Dollhouse looms in 2015, we learned this week that Todd Solondz is preparing for a (sort of) sequel called Weiner Dog. The film will feature different stories and characters, all of whom are connected to each other by a dachshund, hence the title. One of those characters will be Dawn “Weiner Dog” Weiner, who was played by Heather Matarazzo in the first film. In this sequel, the character will be played by new indie sweetheart Greta Gerwig (she’s in talks), who is quite available this autumn after CBS decided not to move forward with her TV show pilot, the sequel How I Met Your Dad. Julie Delpy is also in talks for a role in Weiner Dog, and it’s not currently known if her character also appeared in Welcome to the Dollhouse.&nbsp;#5 ETHAN HAWKE TO STAR IN CHET BAKER BIOPIC BORN TO BE BLUEAnother film project that has been talked about since the 1990s (see I.Q. 83) is the notion of a biopic about the life of jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, who struggled for decades with drug addiction. This week, we learned that just such a movie is finally happening, under the title Born to be Blue. Ethan Hawke, who does bear a resemblance to Chet Baker, will star in the musical biopic, which is currently filming in London. Born to be Blue will be directed by Robert Budreau, and the cast also includes Carmen Ejogo (The Purge: Anarchy) and Callum Keith Rennie (Battlestar Galactica).&nbsp;#6 WALT DISNEY PICTURES HAS GIVEN UP ON JOHN CARTER OF MARSEven people who don’t follow movies that closely knew that in 2012, John Carter was one of the biggest flops of the year, to the degree that the film became a punchline. With a 51% Tomatometer score, John Carter was clearly a Rotten film, but the movie has its fans, and more importantly to why this particular story is a “Fresh Development,” the books by Edgar Rice Burroughs have their fans. They’ve had their fans for a really long time, with elements of Burroughs’ “Barsoom” novels arguably having influenced later franchises such as Superman, Star Wars, and Avatar. Fans frustrated with the 2012 movie should be happy to hear, therefore, that the rights to the John Carter of Mars franchise are leaving Walt Disney Pictures, and reverting back to Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. The company, which is currently working with Warner Bros on a new Tarzan film for 2016, can now proceed with finding a new studio home for future John Carter of Mars movies. (Presumably without Taylor Kitsch or Antonio Sabato Jr.)&nbsp;#7 CHLOE GRACE MORETZ TO STAR IN YA ADAPTATION THE 5TH WAVEEven though the hits (The Hunger Games, Divergent, The Maze Runner) are still joined by the misses (The Host, Beautiful Creatures, Vampire Academy, The Giver), Hollywood is not yet giving up on YA novel adaptations. It’s pretty easy to see why: most of these movies are produced relatively cheaply, so there’s a huge upside if the movie succeeds. Columbia Pictures has started filming an adaptation of the Rick Yancey novel The 5th Wave, directed by J. Blakeson (The Disappearance of Alice Creed). Chloe Grace Moretz stars in the apocalyptic science fiction action thriller set in the days after four increasingly deadly alien attacks have left most of the Earth’s population wiped out, as the survivors prepare for what is expected to be the fifth and final wave of attacks. The cast also includes Ron Livingston and Liev Schreiber. Sony Pictures has scheduled The 5th Wave for release in January of 2016.Rotten Ideas of the Week#2 20TH CENTURY FOX CONSIDERING A QUICKSILVER SOLO MOVIE?As the rights to various Marvel Comics characters continue to be spread across movies produced by Marvel Studios, Sony, and 20th Century Fox, one of the most complicated situations concerns the super speedster Quicksilver. Even as this week saw the first release of a trailer for next year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, where Quicksilver will be played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, we heard news about that other Quicksilver. You see, Quicksilver also appeared prominently in a sequence in X-Men: Days of Future Past where he helps in the rescue of Magneto (who he doesn’t realize is actually his father). 20th Century Fox has the rights to Quicksilver as the son of Magneto, and Marvel Studios has the rights to Quicksilver as the brother of Scarlet Witch, and as a member of the Avengers. Normally, you don’t see big news stories coming from second unit directors, but that’s exactly what seemed to happen this week. Stuntman-turned-second-unit-director Brian Smrz (not having vowels in your last name, now that’s a stunt) was quoted this week talking about the possibility of Quicksilver (the Fox version) getting his own solo movie. After talking about X-Men: Days of Future Past, and confirming that Quicksilver will be in X-Men: Apocalypse, Smrz said, “We talked about Quicksilver before, I’d love to do a Quicksilver as a solo film because there’s a lot to enjoy with that character.” The reason this is a “Rotten Idea” is that it comes so soon after recent stories about growing tension between Marvel Comics and 20th Century Fox, the studio that has the rights to Fantastic Four and X-Men movies. If those stories are true, is 20th Century Fox planning on upping the stakes by making a Quicksilver movie? And if they do, what does that mean for Marvel’s own plans for the character?&nbsp;#1 CABIN FEVER TO GET A WORD-FOR-WORD REMAKE (REMEMBER PSYCHO?)As much as people grouse about remakes and reboots, a concept that has a particularly bad reputation is the “exact remake,” mostly because one of the few times that Hollywood ever attempted it in recent memory was Gus Van Sant’s Psycho. Of course, Alfred Hitchcock is Alfred Hitchcock, Psycho is Psycho, and well, Eli Roth and Cabin Fever are nowhere close to being either. That’s right, the news came out this week that Eli Roth, the director of the 2002 horror film Cabin Fever, is now producing a new remake of Cabin Fever, to be directed using the exact same script as he used in 2002. The new Cabin Fever will have the exact same words and premise, but it will be directed by production-designer-turned-director Travis Zariwny (Scavengers), and feature a new cast that includes Gage Golightly (Teen Wolf), Dustin Ingram (Paranormal Activity 3), Nadine Crocker, Matthew Daddario, and Samuel Davis. Cabin Fever tells the story of what happens when a group of young people vacationing at a cabin in the woods come in contact with a “flesh eating” virus/bacteria. (Short version: they freak out.) If this word-for-word remake of a movie from 2002 is successful, remakes of Ouija and John Wick can’t be far off.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Month, hist, slashers, natural, kong, spanish","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-my-little-pony-movie-coming-in-2017"},{"id":"47509202742783","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Disney Announces Toy Story 4 for June, 2017","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Disney Announces Toy Story 4 for June, 2017Plus, Star Wars Ep. VII gets a title, Terry Gilliam's Don Quixote film might finally happen, and Mark Wahlberg gets bionic.by RT Staff | November 7, 2014 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers ten stories from the world of film development news, such as the latest announcements about Don Quixote, The Six Billion Dollar Man, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Toy Story 4.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryBUZZ AND WOODY TO BE PLAYED WITH AGAIN IN TOY STORY 4Ever since the 2010 release of Toy Story 3, there’s been occasional stories from people like Tom Hanks or director John Lasseter about the possiblity of there someday being a Toy Story 4. Last week, the focus at Disney appeared to be on the big Marvel event, and this week, the studio turned their attention to two other big franchises. During an earnings conference call, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that Toy Story 4 is scheduled for June 16, 2017. Director John Lasseter, who these days mostly focuses on being Disney’s Chief Creative Officer, will make Toy Story 4 his third feature film in the franchise, after taking a break from Toy Story 3 so that he could focus on directing Cars 2. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and Joan Cusack are all also confirmed to be returning as the voices of Woody, Buzz, and Jessie, respectively. This announcement will undoubtedly change other studios’ June, 2017 plans, which currently include How to Train Your Dragon 3 (6/9/17), Wonder Woman (6/23/17), and Despicable Me 3 (6/30/17). The Toy Story 4 script is being adapted by actors-turned-writers Rashida Jones and Will McCormack, who previously cowrote and costarred in (the coincidentally titled) Celeste and Jesse Forever.Fresh Developments This Week#1 EPISODE VII OFFICIALLY TITLED STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENSHow many movies can make top news based on just a title? Apparently, the Star Wars franchise can, because Lucasfilm did exactly that in a “Tweet” confirming that filming had wrapped on November 6, 2014. The title of the movie formerly known as Star Wars Episode VII will be Star Wars: The Force Awakens when Walt Disney Pictures releases it next year on December 18, 2015. The title is a change from the three prequels, which each had awkward titles like Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones. The other detail many fans and writers noticed was that this film will be the first time “The Force” will be mentioned in a title. “The Force” now joins such other previously Star Wars concepts in titles as “the Empire,” “the Jedi,” “the Clones,” and “the Sith” (The Phantom Menace, still not iconic). Star Wars: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams (Star Trek, Super 8, TV’s LOST), and features a cast of both new and returning stars. The returning cast includes Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels, and Peter Mayhew, and the new cast includes John Boyega, Gwendoline Christie, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Daisy Ridley, Andy Serkis, and Max von Sydow.#2 HONEY, I SHRUNK MATT DAMON: DOWNSIZINGRight now, science fiction is just about the last thing anyone thinks of when they consider the films of director Alexander Payne (Election, Sideways, Nebraska), though he did cowrite Jurassic Park III. A satirical science fiction comedy is exactly what Payne plans on directing next, as Matt Damon has signed on to star in a movie called Downsizing. The movie’s been in development for a while, and at one point, Payne’s Sideways star Paul Giamatti had been expected to take the lead role instead. Matt Damon’s signing on to Downsizing also means that he will be dropping out of the Chinese historical epic The Great Wall. Downsizing is about an economically challenged man who realizes that life would be a lot easier if he was smaller, so he shrinks himself (but his wife changes her mind at the last minute). Casting that wife will probably be the next step; at one point, Reese Witherspoon had been attached to that role, and it’s not currently known if she still is.#3 TERRY GILLIAM’S DON QUIXOTE FINALLY HAPPENINGEarly in the 2000s, director Terry Gilliam’s attempt to film a movie in Spain called The Man Who Killed Don Quixote became such a train wreck that it went on to be documented in the 2002 documentary feature Lost in La Mancha. Johnny Depp eventually left the project entirely, and Jean Rochefort is now in his 80s, but it now looks like Terry Gilliam will finally get his Don Quixote movie made. Jack O’Connell, who is starring next month in Angelina Jolie’s Unbroken has been cast in the role that was previously Johnny Depp’s, although some elements of the premise appear to have been changed in the last 14 years. John Hurt will also costar as the title character when filming starts in Spain in January, aiming for a release in May of 2016. This will reportedly be the seventh time that Terry Gilliam (Brazil, The Fisher King) has tried to get this movie produced.#4 KEVIN SPACEY AND MICHAEL SHANNON TO MEET AS ELVIS AND NIXONIn the tradition of Dick and Frost/Nixon, we’re about to get another movie about President Richard Nixon meeting someone, and this one’s a doozy. Michael Shannon will play Elvis Presley, and Kevin Spacey will play Richard Nixon, in Elvis &amp; Nixon. Coming from producer Cassian Elwes (Lee Daniels’ The Butler, Dallas Buyers Club), Elvis &amp; Nixon is another true story, based on the morning in late 1970 in which President Nixon swore in Elvis Presley as an undercover Federal agent for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. This will actually be the second movie about this event, after a low budget 1997 comedy called Elvis Meets Nixon (with Nixon played in that movie by Bob Gunton, AKA the warden from The Shawshank Redemption). The Shannon/Spacey version will be directed by indie director Liza Johnson (Return, Hateship Loveship), who will be working from a script cowritten by actor Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride, Saw), making his screenwriting debut (producer Cassian Elwes is his brother).#5 CHANNING TATUM JOINS QUENTIN TARANTINO’S THE HATEFUL EIGHTChanning Tatum and Demian Bechir (The Heat, A Better Life) have been cast in Quentin Tarantino’s next film, The Hateful Eight (which now definitely has more than eight stars). Demian Bechir will play one of the eight title characters, but Channing Tatum will not (though we don’t know much more than that). The other seven title characters will be played by Bruce Dern, Walton Goggins, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michael Madsen, Kurt Russell, and Tim Roth. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bechir, and Channing Tatum will all be working with Tarantino for the first time in The Hateful Eight, which is about a stagecoach forced to stop during a wintry trip through Wyoming in the years following the Civil War. The Weinstein Company will distribute The Hateful Eight in 70 mm in late 2015. In other Channing Tatum news, 20th Century this week hired screenwriter Josh Zetumer, who worked on the RoboCop remake, to start work on their Gambit movie, in which Channing Tatum will star as the Cajun X-Man.#6 THE CONTINUING STEVE JOBS BIOPIC SAGA: CHRISTIAN BALE OUT, MICHAEL FASSBENDER IN (MAYBE)?Two weeks ago, it seemed like the long process of Sony Pictures finding a star for their Steve Jobs biopic had finally come to an end with the casting of Christian Bale in the role. Except that, this week, Bale dropped out of the film, reportedly because he felt he wasn’t “right for the part” (a decision that you would think would be much more common, but really isn’t). This comes just a week after the news that Seth Rogen had been cast as Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak (and we don’t know if Seth Rogen will stay attached or not). Sony and director Danny Boyle are now re-considering other actors for the role, with the top choice currently being (though this certainly isn’t a sure thing, either) Michael Fassbender. Something that Christian Bale and Michael Fassbender have in common is that they were both potential stars of another recent “biopic” (sort of): Noah, which eventually went to Russell Crowe instead.#7 CHRIS COOPER CAST AS RECLUSIVE AUTHOR J.D. SALINGERWhen author J.D. Salinger (The Catcher in the Rye, Franny and Zooey) died in 2010, it may have been inevitable that a movie about Salinger would follow close behind (as sometimes happens; for example: Steve Jobs). Academy Award winner Chris Cooper (Adaptation, American Beauty) has been cast as author J.D. Salinger in an independent drama called Coming Through the Rye, about two teenagers in 1969 who try to find Salinger. The premise was also somewhat the inspiration for the 2000 movie Finding Forrester, in which Sean Connery played an author clearly inspired by J.D. Salinger, giving the Internet one of its favorite early memes. Coming Through the Rye will mark the feature film debut of TV director Jim Sadwith, whose own experiences are the basis for the film’s script.Rotten Ideas of the Week#2 JAMIE FOXX AND BENICIO DEL TORO (AND THEIR HAIR) TO STAR IN HARMONY KORINE’S THE TRAPAlthough director Harmony Korine had directed four films before it (like Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy), it was with last year’s Spring Breakers that he attracted much more attention. That raised profile may have been a factor in this week’s dual news, which is that first Jamie Foxx and then Benicio Del Toro both signed on to star in The Trap, Harmony Korine’s next film. The Trap is described as both an ensemble gangster drama, a revenge tale, and Korine’s “most ambitious film to date.” James Franco changed up his look considerably for Spring Breakers, so one has to wonder if Foxx and Del Toro will do the same for The Trap. This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas not because of Foxx or Del Toro, but because Harmony Korine’s other four movies besides Spring Breakers all have Rotten Tomatometer scores.#1 MARK WAHLBERG TO BE STRONGER, FASTER, BUT MAYBE NOT BETTER AS… THE SIX BILLION DOLLAR MANIf you keep following movie development as long as this writer has (since 1997), you start remembering that certain movie projects have been in development for close to twenty years. One such project is the movie version of the 1970s science fiction TV series The Six Million Dollar Man, which, for obvious reasons, has long been retitled The Six Billion Dollar Man. Those attempts were both variably dramatic or comedic, with the comedy versions including attempts by writer/director Kevin Smith, and a time when Jim Carrey was attached to star. The project is now back on the dramatic side of things, with Mark Wahlberg set to reunite with his Lone Survivor director Peter Berg. Just like Lee Majors in the TV show, Wahlberg will play a former astronaut who survives a crash through the help of extensive cyborg/bionic implants, including both legs, his right arm, and one of his eyes. The Six Billion Dollar Man is this week’s most Rotten Idea based on the Tomatometer scores for previous action films Peter Berg directed, such as Hancock and the board game adaptation Battleship. Now that they have their Steve Austin, Dimension Films just has to get to work on casting Steve Carell as the Six Billion Dollar Man‘s boss.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Series, Century, documentaries, fast, Mystery, of, book, Office, die, 2019, politics, book, Tour, SDCC, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/toy-story-4.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-disney-announces-toy-story-4-for-june-2017"},{"id":"47509202750980","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Dwayne Johnson Joins Baywatch Movie","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Dwayne Johnson Joins Baywatch Movie\n                        Plus, Joaquin Phoenix drops out of Doctor Strange, I Am Legend gets a reboot, and Tetris will be \"epic.\"\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 3, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes ten top stories from the realm of movie news, including the video game adaptations Angry Birds and Tetris, sequels to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Now You See Me, and potential new roles for Ben Affleck (twice), and Adam Sandler (four times).\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nDWAYNE JOHNSON TO RUN SLOW-MOTION IN BAYWATCH\n\nThe world is still waiting for the inevitable Knight Rider movie, but this week, we heard news that puts the second movie version of a David Hasselhoff TV character closer to happening (the first being Nick Fury). Paramount Pictures is moving forward with their movie version of Baywatch, and the studio has attached Dwayne Johnson as the male lead. The screenwriting team of Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant (of the Night at the Museum franchise) had previously worked on a Baywatch script, but they are now being replaced by Justin Malen, who doesn’t yet have a produced credit (but he has worked on a Bad Teacher sequel). The Baywatch movie will be directed by Sean Anders (That’s My Boy, Horrible Bosses 2), along with his frequent comedy writing partner John Morris. Like the first several seasons of the TV series, the Baywatch movie will depict the adventures of a team of lifeguards “along the perilous shores of Santa Monica.” In other Dwayne Johnson news, the wrestler-turned-actor updated his Twitter account this week with the news that the adaptation of Robert Ludlum’s The Janson Directive (which Johnson will star in) will be adapted by Akiva Goldsman (Lost in Space, Batman &amp; Robin).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 BEN AFFLECK TO STAR IN ACTION THRILLER THE ACCOUNTANT\n\nTiming the announcement fairly precisely with the opening of Gone Girl this weekend, Warner Bros is now in talks with Ben Affleck to star in the “action thriller” The Accountant, which the studio had picked up out of turnaround from Sony Pictures. If Affleck signs on for this film, it will continue a deep relationship between the actor and studio which has included Argo, The Town, and the upcoming Live by Night, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and Justice League. Although no deal is in place yet, Warner Bros is reportedly hoping to hire director Gavin O’Connor (Warrior, Pride and Glory, and the upcoming Jane Got a Gun) to direct The Accountant. As the title and the genre suggest, The Accountant is about “a mild-mannered accountant who moonlights as a lethal assassin.”  When the project was at Sony Pictures, Will Smith had at one time been attached to star.\n\n\n\t\n#2 ALEC BALDWIN TO VOICE BOSS BABY FOR DREAMWORKS ANIMATION\n\nWhat exactly DreamWorks Animation had in the works for their March 18, 2016 slot has been a quasi-mystery for a while, but we learned a whole lot more this week, starting with the two actors who will be voicing the lead characters. Alec Baldwin and Kevin Spacey will star in Boss Baby, an adaptation of a children’s book by Maria Frazee. The animated movie will follow the adventures of a 7-year-old boy who becomes jealous of his new baby brother (Alec Baldwin), who is a “corporate shark” embroiled in the secret plots and dastardly schemes (their words) of the CEO (Kevin Spacey) of a company called Puppy Co. Boss Baby will be directed by Tom McGrath (MegaMind; codirector of Madagascar) from a script by Michael McCullers (Baby Mama; cowriter of Austin Powers in Goldmember). Alec Baldwin and Kevin Spacey previously costarred together in Glengarry Glen Ross.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THIS WEEK IN MOVIE ROLES FOR GAME OF THRONES STARS: THE SCORCH TRIALS AND BASTILE DAY\n\nPerhaps it’s because of the sheer number of actors who can claim to be “stars” of the series, but it’s been a regular thing lately that there’s more than one story in a week about a new movie for someone from HBO’s Game of Thrones. First off, there’s Peter Dinklage, who seems to land a new job weekly (this time, it was a voice role in Angry Birds). Aiden Gillen, who plays Littlefinger, also landed a choice role, as the villain “Rat-Man” in Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, which is the sequel to last month’s The Maze Runner. Giancarlo Esposito, who has costarred in such TV shows as Breaking Bad and Revolution, also landed a role in the sequel as the leader of a “group of survivors known as the Cranks.” 20th Century Fox has already scheduled Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials for release on September 18, 2015. Finally this week, we have the news that Richard Madden, aka Robb Stark on Game of Thrones, has joined Idris Elba in the spy action thriller Bastile Day.\n\n\n\t\n#4 THIS WEEK IN MOVIE DROP OUTS: JOAQUIN PHOENIX AS DOCTOR STRANGE, LEONARDO DICAPRIO AS STEVE JOBS\n\nFor as much attention usually goes to a new report about a given actor starring in a new movie, when that actor eventually decides not to actually do it, there’s usually less attention given. (That’s only true this week for one of these stories.) First up, as your Facebook feed is probably still telling you repeatedly, Joaquin Phoenix is now officially, completely, out of the running to star as Marvel’s Doctor Strange (which is expected to be released in 2016). Another actor who made the news this week (in what turned out to be a quote from two months ago in July) is Ethan Hawke, who previously worked with Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson on 2012’s Sinister. Basically, the gist was that someone at MTV.com asked Ethan Hawke if he would do it, and he replied, “sure.”  Another reversed casting decision came this week from Leonardo DiCaprio, who has dropped out of Sony’s Steve Jobs biopic, though director Danny Boyle is still attached. Sony is now sifting through a new wish list which reportedly includes Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Bradley Cooper, and Christian Bale, who had been David Fincher’s top choice back when he was attached to direct. (Note: This is not so much a “Fresh” development, as a “we-don’t-know-how-to-classify-this” development.)\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#5 A FLOCK OF STARS ANNOUNCED TO VOICE ANGRY BIRDS\n\nWe’re still not in a new golden age of Hollywood filmmaking centered around video game adaptations, but that doesn’t stop new projects from being greenlit in the hopes that they can succeed where Super Mario Bros and Prince of Persia failed. One such attempt is Sony Pictures’ adaptation of the mobile app franchise Angry Birds, which this week unveiled the first image and the main cast of voice actors. First off, there’s the three main characters: Jason Sudeikis as Red (the red bird), Josh Gad as Chuck (the yellow bird), and Danny McBride as Bomb (the large bomb-shaped bird).  Supporting roles will be voiced by Danielle Brooks (Orange is the New Black), Peter Dinklage, Tony Hale (Veep), Maya Rudolph, Keegan-Michael Key (of Key &amp; Peele), and several others. Animators Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly will make their directorial debuts with Angry Birds, which Sony Pictures has scheduled for release on July 1, 2016.\n\n\n\t\n#4 DANIEL RADCLIFFE TO PLAY MICHAEL CAINE’S SON IN NOW YOU SEE ME 2\n\nMichael Caine revealed this week a new addition to the sequel to Now You See Me, which is already scheduled for June 10, 2016. Let’s just go ahead and quote him, “There’s a sequel to Now You See Me and we’re shooting in London. I shoot in December, the whole of December in London, and my son is Harry Potter. I thought it’d be funny, me and Daniel Radcliffe as father and son.” As surprisingly successful as the first movie was, it also scored just 50% on the RT Tomatometer, and that’s pretty much the sole reason this is Rotten. We can agree with Michael Caine that “Harry Potter” could play his son… just not in this movie. We also have yet to reach the point where Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson stories aren’t included together, because she and Daniel Bruhl are going to be in a Chile-set drama called Colonia, and we just did it.\n\n\n\t\n#3 I AM LEGEND TO BECOME A MOVIE AGAIN (FOR THE FOURTH TIME)\n\nRichard Matheson’s revisionist vampire novel I Am Legend was first published in 1954, but it wasn’t for another fifty years that it was adapted as a movie with that title. Which is not to say that it wasn’t adapted as a movie. First, there was The Last Man on Earth (in 1964, starring Vincent Price), and then there was The Omega Man (in 1971, starring Charlton Heston). This week, after years of development as both a prequel and/or a sequel, Warner Bros’ plans for following up on the Will Smith I Am Legend took a new turn. The studio has decided to turn a spec script called A Garden at the End of the World by former Apple Store employee Gary Graham into a new adaptation of Richard Matheson’s I Am Legend. That alone is not such a crazy idea, because that most recent movie already made several changes to Matheson’s basic story. As for why we’re calling this a Rotten Idea, it’s pretty simple: why can’t Gary Graham’s script just be adapted for what he clearly intended it to be (an original idea)? When Warner Bros first acquired it, A Garden at the End of the World was described as being a “a sci-fi version of John Wayne’s The Searchers.”\n\n\n\t\n#2 NETFLIX, ADAM SANDLER, AND THE CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON SEQUEL\n\nThis was a very big week for Netflix, and their inevitable plans to branch from “TV shows” to “movies.”  First, there was the announcement for the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon sequel, which now has the full title of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend. We’ve known for a while that the sequel was being produced by The Weinstein Company, but what was much less expected was that the sequel will premiere exclusively on Netflix (and in selected IMAX theaters). This is also something of a big deal for the Weekly Ketchup, because our rule has always been not to (knowingly) cover “direct to video” movies, but where does “direct to Netflix” fall in that definition? This announcement was also closely followed by news of a boycott from AMC, Regal, and Cinemark, which account for the majority of IMAX theaters in the USA. You can (figuratively) smell the tension in a quote like this one: “No one has approached us to license this made-for-video sequel in the U.S. or China, so one must assume the screens IMAX committed are in science centers and aquariums.” Truthfully, this isn’t the Rotten part of this story. No, that came later in the week, when Netflix also announced the online streaming service has signed a four movie deal with Adam Sandler. If Sandler (and his contemporaries) start making deals with services like Netflix to bypass theaters, what does that mean for the future of movies? Will there even be certain genres at the cineplex ten years from now? Or… was Adam Sandler inevitably going to start making “direct to video” movies soon anyway, and this is just how it happens?\n\n\n\t\n#1 YOU WILL BELIEVE COLORED BLOCKS CAN DESCEND AT INCREASE VELOCITY IN… TETRIS\n\nYou know how we remarked earlier about Hollywood’s continued attempts at “making video game movies happen” (not in those exact words, admittedly, which we saved… for this story)?  Well, this one is sort of the example that defines the trend. Threshold Entertainment, the company that had early success back in the 1990s with the video game adaptation Mortal Kombat, is now trying to repeat it with, of all things, Tetris. Apparently well aware of how dumb — no, stupid — no, let’s go with… “ridiculous” a Tetris movie sounds, Threshold CEO Larry Kasanoff remarked, “This isn’t a movie with a bunch of lines running around the page. We’re not giving feet to the geometric shapes.” Instead, the Tetris movie will be “a very big, epic sci-fi movie,” because that worked so well the last time that approach was applied to an adaptation of a non-narrative game. To be clear, it’s possible to be entertained by Tetris: The Movie, but… only as the already existing fan-made spoof trailer.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Association, 2015, dark","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Dwayne-Johnson-Joins-Baywatch-Movie"},{"id":"47509204507163","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Star Wars Episode VII Cast Announced","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Star Wars Episode VII Cast AnnouncedPlus, new films for Joaquin Phoenix, Will Ferrell, and Steven Spielberg, and tons of comic book movie news.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 2, 2014 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup comes to you on the release date of a big superhero movie, and with all of that buzz, we also had a week of big, Big, BIG movie development stories concerning Star Wars Episode VII, directors Steven Spielberg and Baz Luhrmann, and comic book properties Justice League, The Sinister Six, and The Fantastic Four.This Week’s Top StorySTAR WARS EPISODE VII CAST OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCEDAlthough there have been many Star Wars Episode VII casting rumors in past months, few of them had any hard facts. Most were about returning cast members, with Adam Driver (of HBO’s Girls), cast as one of the film’s villains, the only new confirmed actor before this week. This week, we found out what Lucasfilms was waiting on was a script read at Pinewood Studios, which allowed for a photo of the cast. First off, there are the returning cast members: Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia Organa), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), and Kenny Baker (R2-D2). They will be joined by the aforementioned Adam Driver, John Boyega (Attack the Block), Domhnall Gleeson (Bill Weasley of Harry Potter fame), Oscar Isaac (Inside Llewyn Davis), Andy Serkis, Max von Sydow (The Exorcist), and newcomer British actress Daisy Ridley. (Rotten Tomatoes has this handy gallery for you to put faces to the names). That list led some fans to complain that the new cast was a bit of a sausage fest, but that was also quickly followed by a calming word: there may be one more big announcement to come, and it’s an actress. This Sunday is the next “Star Wars Day,” and might be a good time for that second announcement. One name that had been rumored a while back was Academy Award winner Lupita Nyong’o, for example. The lingering question to the remaining announcement is… why wasn’t that person (or persons) included with the rest? Walt Disney Pictures will release Star Wars Episode VII on December 18, 2015.Fresh Developments This Week#1 JOAQUIN PHOENIX TO STAR IN WOODY ALLEN’S 2015 FILMThe last year has been a rocky road for writer/director Woody Allen, with the high points being the accolades accorded to his 2013 film Blue Jasmine, and the low points being, well, you-know-what. This July sees the release of Woody Allen’s 2014 film, the 1920s France-set comedy Magic in the Moonlight, featuring Colin Firth, Emma Stone, Marcia Gay Harden, Hamish Linklater, and Jacki Weaver. This week, we learned the first detail about what will become Woody Allen’s 2015 release, which is that Joaquin Phoenix has signed on as the first cast member. As is usual with Woody Allen movies before they start filming, we know pretty much nothing else about the film, except that it starts filming in July somewhere in the United States.&nbsp;#2 STEVEN SPIELBERG’S THIRD NEW PROJECT IN THREE WEEKS IS… THE BFGThe last few weeks have been sort of crazy with the “____ will be Steven Spielberg’s next movie” stories, to such a degree that this week, people seemed to just sort of overlook (or ignore) this one. The director is in danger of becoming the ‘berg who cried wolf, it seems, after recent announcements about both The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara and a Cold War legal drama about the Gary Powers U2 spy plane incident. The third movie story brings with it a bit more of a solid commitment, but is planned for filming in early 2015, which allows room for a “smaller” film to squeeze in. That 2015 movie will be an adaptation of the 1982 children’s book The BFG by Roald Dahl. The title refers to a “big friendly giant” but a funny thing happened in the 30 years since that book, which is that video gaming culture adopted “BFG” to mean something very different (Big F***ing Gun, namely). That confusion will be an obstacle (of sorts) to Spielberg’s film, but this won’t be the first time Spielberg’s directed a kids movie with initials (E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, A.I. Artificial Intelligence). The Roald Dahl book about a giant who befriends a young orphaned girl was adapted by screenwriter Melissa Mathison, whose previous credits include The Black Stallion, Kundun, and Spielberg’s E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.&nbsp;#3 MATT SMITH TO TURN TERMINATOR: GENESIS ALL WIBBLY WOBBLY TIMEY WIMEY?The more we hear about Terminator: Genesis, the more it seems reasonable that previous reports were alternately describing it as a reboot, or prequel, or sequel, or remake, or… some combination of all four. Check out this piece for an example of what sort of Back to the Future-style time travel craziness this new film might be including. Perhaps it’s quite thematically appropriate therefore, that the latest cast member to be announced is a recent graduate of Doctor Who, Doctor #11, Matt Smith. Unlike several of the previous announcements, Matt Smith will be playing a new character, although it’s someone with a “strong connection” to future anti-machines freedom fighter John Connor (to be played by Jason Clarke). Paramount Pictures has scheduled Terminator: Genesis, directed by Alan Taylor (Thor: The Dark World), for July 1, 2015.&nbsp;#4 WILL FERREL ATTACHED TO CROWN JEWELS HEIST COMEDY THE YANKA lot of press has been devoted lately to Sony Pictures’ pursuit of some new box office fuel, although in this week of the release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, that hype train has slowed down a bit. The only new project of note was acquired by Sony subsidiary TriStar, in the form of a comedy pitch with Will Ferrell attached to star. If it actually gets produced, Ferrell will star in The Yank as “a mild mannered insurance courier who gets caught up in a conspiracy to steal the Crown Jewels in London.” The Yank will be written by Steve Pink (High Fidelity, cowriter of Grosse Pointe Blank) and writing partner Jeff Morris. Steve Pink has also directed films like Hot Tub Time Machine and the 2014 remake of About Last Night.&nbsp;#5 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL SUPPORTING SCIENTIST ROLES: FROM THE INCREDIBLE HULK TO THE FANTASTIC FOURThis story concerns a new trend in superhero movies, and we can probably credit/blame Sam Raimi’s first Spider-Man for starting it. The trope basically involves a scientist supporting role which teases at a villain who might play a bigger role in an upcoming franchise entry. One example of this was Marvel’s 2008 film The Incredible Hulk, which featured Tim Blake Nelson as Dr. Samuel Sterns, who was teased at possibly returning as the Hulk’s #1 classic nemesis, The Leader (basically a green guy with a reallly huge gamma-radiated forehead/brain). Alas, it’s six years later, and we’re not really hearing much about such a film, but that isn’t stopping Tim Blake Nelson from playing scientist supporting roles in Marvel movies. The actor has basically finalized talks with 20th Century Fox to costar in their reboot of The Fantastic Four as scientist nerd Harvey Elder, who is best known as Mole Man, who has the distinction of being the Fantastic Four’s first ever villain (way back in Fantastic Four #1). One little detail that appears to have gotten past most writers about this story is that the revelation of the character’s name being Harvey Elder (instead of say, Arthur Molekevic) is that this is the first we’ve heard about this movie being closer to the Earth-616 version (where his name is Harvey Elder) than the Ultimate version (where his name is Arthur Molekevic). Of course, that might just be a coincidence; the role in question might only have 7 lines in Act 1 and be completely overlooked by most moviegoers, and this movie is still basically based upon Ultimate Fantastic Four (in which the four leads are much younger). Anyway, 20th Century Fox has scheduled The Fantastic Four, directed by Josh Trank (Chronicle), for June 19, 2015. We’re going to call this story a borderline “Fresh Development” because, hey, Tim Blake Nelson was awesome in O Brother Where Art Thou. At least this story means a great character actor gets another fat pay day.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 MAN OF STEEL‘S ZACK SNYDER CONFIRMED TO DIRECT JUSTICE LEAGUEIf one wants to sniff out the differences between how Marvel Studios steers their movies and how Warner Bros is handling the entire DC Comics cinematic universe, one element is the variety of directors. Or in the case of WB/DC, the lack thereof. The Marvel movies have thus far been directed by a wide assortment of talents, some of whom seemed like left field choices (Kenneth Branagh on Thor, the Community guys on Captain America: The Winter Soldier). The Batman/Superman movies, on the other hand, have all been directed since Batman Begins by just two directors: Christopher Nolan, and now, Zack Snyder. And this week, we learned that this narrowness will continue as Zack Snyder will also direct the Justice League movie that follows the Man of Steel sequel (5/6/16). This story was quickly followed by another that claimed the two movies will be filmed basically back-to-back, with Justice League to be released sometime in 2017. No official casting announcements have been made yet, but we can pretty much guess/presume that Justice League will include Ben Affleck as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, and Ray Fisher as Cyborg (a New Teen Titan who in the recent “New 52” was retconned into being a founding JLA member). All of this comes from an article in the Wall Street Journal that also updates us on Warner Bros’ other plans, which include nine DC Comics adaptations, most of which are unnamed, but the named titles include Sandman, Shazam (AKA DC’s Captain Marvel), Metal Men, Fables, and 100 Bullets. Hopefully, somewhere in there, DC still has plans for a Wonder Woman movie before 2020?&nbsp;#3 BAZ LUHRMANN IN TALKS TO EXTRAVAGANTLY DIRECT… AN ELVIS PRESLEY BIOPIC?For the record, this writer would like to note that you certainly have to give director Baz Luhrmann credit for his cinematic ambitions: with movies like The Great Gatsby, Moulin Rouge! and Romeo + Juliet, Luhrmann really goes out — way out — to impress our visual cortices. The down side is that a) Baz Luhrmann ends up not directing that many movies, and b) if those movies are critical misfires, that creates a big gap between 2014 and say, the 2001 release of his last “fresh” film, Moulin Rouge! Anyway, Luhrmann was reported this week as being in talks with Warner Bros to direct an Elvis Presley biopic which is not based on any existing work (like say, a biography, as prevously reported film projects have usually been). Pretty much nothing else is known about the project, except that it’s being written by screenwriter Kelly Marcel, whose filmography began recently with the also-a-true-story Saving Mr. Banks, and continues next year with the adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey.&nbsp;#2 KEVIN SMITH’S NON-RETIREMENT CONTINUES WITH… ANTI-CLAUSWriter/director Kevin Smith has done a fair amount of talking in recent months/years about his impending retirement from directing, which Smith has said will take effect after he wraps up filming of Clerks 3. Where that prediction gets “hinky” is that we don’t know when Kevin Smith will actually make that third Clerks movie. The reason this discussion lands in the “Rotten Ideas” section is that Kevin Smith’s output since 2008 has been a consistent morass of green splotches on the RT Tomatometer. Anyway, we learned this week that Kevin Smith is planning on using several of his Tusk cast members to film another horror movie back-to-back, based on the Krampus. The project will be a “Yuletide horror” film called Anti-Claus, about the German/Alpine folktale monster that basically addresses the “naughty” side of Santa’s list, by eating bad little boys and girls. The actors that will be appearing in both the walrus-themed horror film Tusk and the Christmas horror film Anti-Claus include Justin Long, Haley Joel Osment, Genesis Rodriguez, and Michael Parks.&nbsp;#1 THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 LEADS TO THE SINISTER SIX… AND NOT ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN… EVER?As is usual with the week of a big movie release like The Amazing Spider-Man 2, there was a fair amount of online press for that movie and, as things follow, the movies that Sony has planned after it. Most directly, there is the spinoff movie The Sinister Six, which was teased this week in a video that you can get through an app (see the link for instructions, basically). What that shows us are close ups of devices which seem to confirm which characters will make up the Sinister Six, and they are: Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, Kraven the Hunter, Mysterio, Rhino, and The Vulture. The Sinister Six will be directed by Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods, Cloverfield), which leans us towards “Fresh,” but then we remember we’re talking about a Spider-Man movie (even if he might not be in it) about not 3 villains (which has proven bad enough in the past and present), but six? The other sort-of-big news this week from the Spider-Man-verse came in the form of a terse “No” in reply to a particularly interesting question, namely whether or not we might ever see such other Spider-Men as Miles Morales (Ultimate Spider-Man), Ben Reilly (Peter Parker’s clone), or Miguel O’Hara (Spider-Man 2099). Not only is that bad news for fans of those characters (who want to see them get their own movies), but also for people who were hoping to someday see something like this. Of course, the real reason all of this lands as the “Rotten Idea” of the week is that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has been named… the worst reviewed Spider-Man movie ever.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Sci-Fi, Video, talk, rotten, 2020, 2016, TV, jamie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-star-wars-episode-vii-cast-announced"},{"id":"47509074816334","title":"Video Interviews with Ethan Hawke &amp; Julie Delpy of Before Midnight","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video Interviews with Ethan Hawke &amp; Julie Delpy of Before MidnightAlso Co-Writer &amp; Director Richard Linklaterby Grae Drake | May 24, 2013 |  CommentsOnce they all get past the initial awkwardness of Grae Drake begging Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy not to break up with her, they discuss some of the deeper meanings of the filmmaking process, and whether or not they believe in soulmates.&nbsp;","section":"Video Interviews","tags":"Western, streaming, Valentine's, BAFTA, Christmas, Us, superman, The, Film","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"video-interviews-with-ethan-hawke-and-julie-delpy-of-before-midnight"},{"id":"47509204497944","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Godzilla Director to Helm Star Wars Spinoff in 2016","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Godzilla Director to Helm Star Wars Spinoff in 2016\n                        Also, Edgar Wright leaves Ant-Man, and the Coen Brothers team up with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 22, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup comes to you during the Cannes Film Festival, which means we were deluged with lots of announcements from the film market there. Particularly dominating this news cycle were “true stories,” with at least five such films covered here. The mix also includes new roles for Michael Fassbender, Aaron Paul, and Daniel Radcliffe; and new projects for directors Kathryn Bigelow, Derek Cianfrance, Nicolas Winding Refn, and Ridley Scott.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nGODZILLA DIRECTOR TAKES ON STAR WARS SPINOFF FOR 2016\n\nThe signs were there, leading up to last weekend, that the 2014 reboot of Godzilla was going to perform very well at the box office. That the movie actually opened to the biggest single box office day of the year thus far ($38.5 million on Friday the 16th) has had a direct impact on movie development news this week, specifically on two stories. There’s the obvious one (which you will find down below), but the biggest and most surprising announcement concerned Godzilla director Gareth Edwards. Edwards has signed with Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Pictures to direct the first Star Wars spinoff movie, which the studio has scheduled for December 16, 2016. The plan appears to be for the main “Episode” films to be released in Decembers of odd years, and the spinoffs in even years. We don’t know yet which of the spinoffs will be coming first, but the three that we know about (that are rumored, we should say) concern the early adventures of Han Solo, Yoda, and Boba Fett. Whichever movie Gareth Edwards is going to be directing for late 2016, it’s the movie currently being written by screenwriter Gary Whitta, writer of The Book of Eli, cowriter of After Earth, and writer of a few The Walking Dead video games. Meanwhile, while filming Star Wars Episode VII, director J.J. Abrams has announced a charity event for UNICEF called Star Wars: Force for Change. People who donate to the event will be entered for a chance at various prizes, including being cast to appear in a scene in the movie. Star Wars Episode VII is scheduled for release on December 18, 2015.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 ALFONSO CUARON, FANTASTIC BEASTS…, AND THE SHINING PREQUEL\n\nAfter the critical and box office success of Gravity last year, Warner Bros clearly has an interest in staying with Alfonso Cuaron (that his NBC series Believe was cancelled recently, aside). This week, we heard about two different projects at WB for Alfonso Cuaron, and although neither was confirmed, neither was really denied (yet), either. The bigger profile of the two, and the project with the most obvious direct connection to Alfonso Cuaron (who directed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), is another J.K. Rowling adaptation.  Warner Bros recently announced a release date of November 18, 2016 for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the first of a planned trilogy of movies focusing on the monster hunting adventures of Newt Scamander, set in the same magical world as Harry Potter, although 70 years earlier, in Rowling’s magical version of New York City. The other possible Cuaron/WB project this week, which is slightly more in the “rumored” category, is another prequel to a popular Warner Bros film. Alfonso Cuaron may have been offered the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of one of his favorite directors, Stanley Kubrick. The project in question is called The Overlook Hotel, and it’s planned to be a prequel to Stanley Kubrick’s version of The Shining, ostensibly set during the period of one of the events mentioned in the film (there were a couple). The Overlook Hotel is being written by Glen Mazzara, showrunner on The Walking Dead, and the producers include Bradley Fischer (Black Swan), Laeta Kalogridis (Shutter Island), and James Vanderbilt (Zodiac). If Alfonso Cuaron does actually sign on for both films, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them appears to be more likely to start filming first, given the 2016 release date, and the amount of postproduction that a tentpole fantasy film with a myriad array of monsters and creatures would require.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE COEN BROTHERS TO REUNITE WITH TOM HANKS ON SPIELBERG’S SPY PLANE PROJECT\n\nOne of the top stories last week was the revelation that the next directing project for the Coen Brothers (after Inside Llewyn Davis) will be called Hail Caesar, set in the golden age of Hollywood. The prolific Coens, however, usually do work on multiple projects at once, and so, it wasn’t really that surprising that their names came up again this week, in their capacity as screenwriters. Joel and Ethan Coen have signed on as (rewrite) screenwriters for the untitled U2 spy plane drama that will feature Tom Hanks, and will be directed by Steven Spielberg. In addition to being a reunion for Hanks and Spielberg (their fourth feature film together), this news also reunites Tom Hanks with the directors of his remake of The Ladykillers. Tom Hanks will be starring in the true story film as attoney James Donovan, who was recruited to negotiate with the KGB for the release of U-2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers. The original screenplay was by newcomer Matt Charman, and the Coen Brothers will be doing a draft based on it.\n\n\n\t\n#3 GODZILLA TO GET SEQUELS… OBVIOUSLY\n\nAnytime nowadays that there is an opening of the level of Godzilla, then yes, it’s almost a “well duh” reaction that there will be indeed be a Godzilla 2.  In fact, there will be a Godzilla 3 as well.  There have been hints that Mothra might appear in the next film, but other possibilities include Rodan, King Ghidorah, and Mechagodzilla. Legendary Pictures is no longer based at Warner Bros (they moved to Universal last year), but the two companies will continue to partner on the Godzilla movies.  And yes, director Gareth Edwards was confirmed this week as still being on board the Godzilla trilogy… he’ll just be doing the Star Wars spinoff first before Godzilla 2.  Busy guy.\n\n\t\n#4 LEGO SPINOFF FRANCHISE NINJAGO CREEPS INTO THEATERS IN 2016\n\nThe other 2014 box office success for Warner Bros that continues to inspire attempts at future replication is The LEGO Movie. This week, Warner Bros confirmed that the previously announced LEGO spinoff Ninjago indeed has been given a greenlight, and a release date of September 23, 2016. Basically, it’s about LEGO characters who are ninjas. The toy brand includes a Cartoon Network animated series, and the writers of that show are also writing the Ninjago movie. The film will also mark the feature film debut of Charlie Bean, who has previously directed episodes of TRON: Uprising and Robotboy. Sony Pictures also has an (untitled) animated movie scheduled for September 23, 2016.\n\n\n\t\n#5 THE TOY FRANCHISE TREND CONTINUES WITH… MONSTER HIGH\n\nWarner Bros is not the only studio that is moving forward with toy franchise adaptations following the success of The LEGO Movie. Universal Pictures has also scheduled a fall 2016 date (October 7, just two weeks after Ninjago) for their Monster High movie, based upon the popular Mattel line of monstrous dolls. Unlike many of these films, Monster High appears to be a live action film, not animated. The Monster High movie is being written by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, who have previously worked together on the TV shows Gossip Girl and The O.C. (Schwartz is also known for his work on TV’s Chuck).\n\n\t\n#6 TRUE STORY CASTING: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH JOINS BLACK MASS; TOM WILKINSON AS LBJ\n\nTwo different films based on true stories involving famous 20th century figures are now filming on location in the United States, and there’s new cast to announce for both.  First up, there is Warner Bros’ Whitey Bulger movie Black Mass, which Johnny Depp is starring in as the infamous Boston mobster. Benedict Cumberbatch has joined the cast as the mobster’s brother Billy Burger, replacing the previously announced Guy Pearce. Parks and Recreation star Adam Scott has joined the cast as an F.B.I. agent, joining an ensemble which now includes Joel Edgerton, Dakota Johnson, Jesse Plemens, and Juno Temple. Black Mass is filming in Boston, and down in Alabama and Georgia, there’s the long-in-development movie Selma, about crucial events in the life of Martin Luther King, Jr. This week, we learned that Tom Wilkinson will be playing President Lyndon Baines Johnson, joining David Oyelowo as Rev. King, Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, Andre Holland as Andrew Young, and Colman Domingo as Ralph Abernathy. The many producer credits of Selma include Oprah Winfrey (Harpo Films) and Brad Pitt (Plan B).\n\n\n\t\n#7 THIS WEEK IN STEPHEN KING ADAPTATIONS: GERALD’S GAME AND IT (PARTS 1 AND 2)\n\nThe novels and short stories of Stephen King have inspired dozens of adaptations, and at any point, there’s at least a dozen others in development, somewhere. One of King’s novels which has not previously attracted much attention was the 1992 bondage/survival thriller Gerald’s Game, but with 50 Shades of Grey coming in 2015, perhaps that book’s time is finally here. Oculus director Mike Flanagan hopes to make Gerald’s Game his next film, and he’s been in Cannes this week, hoping to find producing help with a film that he compares to Misery and Dolores Claiborne (but with handcuffs and sex toys, we guess).   Another Stephen King adaptation, the two-part adaptation of IT, also made the news this week at Warner Bros (they were busy over there!). The studio has shifted development of IT from the main studio to subsidiary New Line Cinema, along with the announcement that going forward, horror films will be handled by New Line Cinema, and not so much Warner Bros itself. This shift might also apply to another Stephen King-related film, The Overlook, mentioned up above. IT is planned as two movies: the first about the friends encountering Pennywise the clown monster as kids, and the second film finishing the adventure, as adults. Cue the competition from Goonies 2.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 FORMER TEEN STARS MOLLY RINGWALD AND JULIETTE LEWIS JOIN JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS\n\nFor people who actively follow movie development, there’s a certain pattern you get used to. Films are announced, and then they spend years and years sort of “developing” before they’re finally produced. This is especially true with “franchise” projects that are adaptations of pre-existing intellectual properties. And then, there’s Jem and the Holograms, based on the 1990s animated TV show, which has done all of that in just a few months, and is already filming. In two somewhat gimmicky casting moves this week, the production has cast two actresses who were each teen movie stars in subsequent decades. From the 1980s, you have Molly Ringwald, star of John Hughes movies Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and Pretty in Pink, and much, much later, there was the TV show The Secret Life of the American Teenager, with Shailene Woodley. Representing the 1990s, we have Juliette Lewis, whose path was distinctively darker, appearing in such films as Cape Fear, Natural Born Killers, and From Dusk Till Dawn. The nature of both roles are currently unknown, but Juliette Lewis has in the past fronted her own rock band, so… that might be a hint.  Anyway, let’s call all this borderline “rotten”… just because. Stunt casting!\n\n\n\t\n#1 THIS WEEK IN SUPERFLUOUS SUBTITLES: BATMAN V. KINGSMAN – DAWN OF SECRETS OF SERVING JUSTICE\n\nThere’s a long tradition of franchise entries having subtitles. There’s nothing wrong with it, and sometimes tells you more than what you would get from just a single roman numeral or whatever. This week, Warner Bros announced the official title of one of their (no, probably their single biggest) upcoming movies, in 2016, at least. That film is what we’ve previously called a sequel to Man of Steel. Well, now we can call it Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.  And that title… well, it’s just a mess.  You can tell that the studio wanted to include Batman and Superman, and also hint at it leading to a Justice League.  What they ended up with though, is just… wow. First of all, there’s the idea of Batman going “versus” Superman.  Yes, it’s an established trope in the comics that Batman can defeat anyone given enough planning, but to the “four quadrant” crowd out there, it seems like a lopsided fight.  And why is it “v” instead of “Vs.” or “Versus”?  And why “Dawn of Justice,” at all?  There are plenty of cool uses of the word “justice” in existing DC Comics, which could have been appropriated. Anyway, in other superfluous title additions, 20th Century Fox also got into the game by adding a completely new word (Kingsman) to their adaptation of the comic book The Secret Service, so that it is now Kingsman: The Secret Service. Matthew Vaughn directs, Colin Firth stars, and Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Caine costar in the movie, which is scheduled for October 24, 2014. Going back to the Superman franchise, the new confusing title was also announced the same week that franchise screenwriter David S. Goyer sort of stuck his foot in his mouth when asked about two green-skinned characters: Marvel’s She-Hulk, and DC’s Martian Manhunter. Some of the She-Hulk stuff, we can’t even reprint here, but wow… just wow.  Let’s just say, it’s all kindling for discussions about how the current WB/DC writers and creative types are handling those characters, and how it differs from what Marvel does with their characters. That whole thing even got Stan Lee talking about She-Hulk. And you don’t want to see Stan Lee when he’s angry (someone had to do that joke!). BREAKING NEWS: Speaking of Stan Lee, we’ve just learned of a new development regarding an upcoming Marvel property that certainly fits in the #1 Rotten spot this week: Due to creative differences, Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) will no longer be directing Ant-Man. Marvel apparently has a replacement lined up, but they haven’t announced who it is yet. It’s a pretty surprising and disappointing development, considering Wright has been associated with the film since 2006.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"composers, monster, star, the, killer, Diego, movie, Plus","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Godzilla-Director-to-Helm-Star-Wars-Spinoff-in-2016"},{"id":"47509204472335","title":"Weekly Ketchup (Pre-Comic-Con): Idris Elba Joins Guy Ritchie’s King Arthur","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup (Pre-Comic-Con): Idris Elba Joins Guy Ritchie's King Arthur\n                        Stay tuned for a Comic-Con-specific Weekly Ketchup, coming your way on Monday.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 25, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nEvery July, the worlds of movies, TV, games, and yes, comic books, collide for four days in San Diego, giving us dozens of announcements, which is far more than we can fit into just one Weekly Ketchup.

There will be another Weekly Ketchup in a few days, after SDCC, to cover all of the biggest announcements and revelations.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nIDRIS ELBA CASTS HIS SPELLS AS NEW MERLIN IN KING ARTHUR\n\nWhen British actor (who’s of African descent) Idris Elba was first announced as playing the Norse God Heimdall in the 2011 Marvel movie Thor, there was an Internet outcry (from some). And then the movie came out, and Idris Elba was awesome, so that by the time Thor: The Dark World came out, no one even seemed to talk about the controversy anymore. A similar thing happened this week, with a character that’s equally connected to European folklore and legend, and the reaction was… pretty much non-existent. Progress! Idris Elba is now in talks with Warner Bros to star in King Arthur as a “Merlin-esque figure who trains and mentors Arthur.” The next casting step will be for director Guy Ritchie (Sherlock Holmes) to find the young actor who will be starring as King Arthur in this film, and its expected sequels. Guy Ritchie is also preparing The Man from U.N.C.L.E. for Warner Bros, which is scheduled for January 16, 2015. Warner Bros has scheduled the first film (of a potential six movies) of their new King Arthur franchise for July 22, 2016.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 SANDRA BULLOCK TO STAR IN TUPPERWARE BIOPIC\n\nJennifer Lawrence and director David O. Russell are reuniting for a Miracle Mop biopic for Oscar season, 2015 (called Joy), and now that project appears to be getting a very similarly-themed competitor. Sony Pictures has acquired the rights to the non-fiction book Tupperware Unleashed by Bob Kealing, about the woman who came up with the idea for “Tupperware Parties,” launching a new era of feminine entrepreneurship. Sandra Bullock is attached to star as Brownie Wise, and the project will be directed by Tate Taylor, who is becoming something of a specialist on biopic/period films, following The Help, and the upcoming James Brown film Get On Up.\n\n\t\n#2 WILL FERRELL AND ADAM MCKAY TAKE ON MANIMAL FOR SONY PICTURES ANIMATION\n\nIt was back in 2012 that we first heard that Sony Pictures Animation was adapting the short-lived 1980s animal-shapeshifting detective TV series Manimal as an animated film. This week, we found out exactly who Sony is working with to give us a new vision of Manimal. And no, it’s not going to be a grim and gritty version. Will Ferrell and frequent collaborator Adam McKay are the two who will be lending their talents to Manimal, although it’s unclear what either of them will be doing besides producing (McKay won’t be directing, and Ferrell is not yet announced as doing any voice work).  Here’s some of what Adam McKay had to say about the project, “Like The Catcher in the Rye or The Sound and the Fury, Manimal has always been one of those elusive projects every producer dreams of taking to the silver screen… I know the movie will be funny and entertaining, but will it be the first film to win a Pulitzer? We’ll just have to see.” It’s good to have dreams.\n\n\n\t\n#3 BRAD PITT AND ANGELINA JOLIE TO REUNITE CINEMATICALLY FOR BY THE SEA\n\nAlthough they are still not technically married in real life, the former Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, will again be playing a married couple in an “intimate character driven drama” called By the Sea. There have been rumors about the project for a few months now, and although we still don’t know many premise details, the film was written by and will be directed by Angelina Jolie, and both Pitt and Jolie are producing the film. By the Sea will be Jolie’s third narrative film as director, following In the Land of Blood and Honey, and the upcoming Unbroken.  Brad Pitt will also appear, later this year, in the World War II tank action film Fury.\n\n\n\t\n#4 STEVE CARELL TO STAR IN TROPIC FAMILY COMEDY BROOKLYN FAMILY ROBINSON\n\nWalt Disney Pictures has picked up the rights to the family adventure comedy Brooklyn Family Robinson. Steve Carell is attached to play a New York father who relocates his family to a tropical island, where presumably, high jinks ensue. Carell is also producing the comedy. Brooklyn Family Robinson was written by David Reynolds, who was nominated for an Academy Award for cowriting Pixar’s Finding Nemo.\n\n\n\t\n#5 THE BEST MAN WEDDING TO CONTINUES COMEDY FRANCHISE IN 2016\n\nWhen it was released in 1999, The Best Man was a surprise success (predicting by several years the successes of later African American cast comedies), and as the title suggests, it was about a wedding. Fourteen years later, the film was followed by a sequel, last year’s The Best Man Holiday, and the promise was made that audiences would not have to wait that long for a third movie. The date that fulfills that promise was revealed this week as Universal Pictures has announced The Best Man Wedding for April 15, 2016. All of the cast (including Morris Chestnut, Taye Diggs, Regina Hall, Terrence Howard, Sanaa Lathan, Nia Long, and Harold Perrineau) are expected to return for writer/director Malcolm D. Lee.\n\n\n\t\n#6 WALT DISNEY PICTURES ADAPTING APE/ELEPHANT STORY THE ONE AND ONLY IVAN\n\nFor a studio that is presumably busy this week promoting various Marvel and Star Wars projects, Walt Disney Pictures announced many of the other news stories this week, as well. One of those was a movie based upon the 2011 children’s novel The One and Only Ivan, by author Katherine Applegate. Screenwriter Mike White (School of Rock, Orange County) will make his directorial debut with the story of a silverback gorilla named Ivan who is caged at a shopping center “zoo” along with two elephants, one of which (a baby) with whom Ivan plans an escape from an abusive human. That Walt Disney Pictures is developing this movie is especially curious when we remember that it was only a few weeks ago that we also learned that Disney is developing a live-action remake of Dumbo, which is also about a mother/baby pair of elephants.\n\n\n\t\n#7 DAYBREAKERS DIRECTORS DEVELOPING HAMMER HAUNTED HOUSE\n\nThe Spierig Brothers, Michael and Peter, who as a directorial team have recently given us the 2010 vampire film Daybreakers and the upcoming film Predestination, have signed on with Hammer Films (The Woman in Black) for a new horror project. The Spierig Brothers are adapting a script about the Winchester Mystery House,a San Jose mansion which is publicized as the “world’s most haunted house.” The focus of the film will be on Sarah Winchester, the firearms fortune heiress who believed in the 1880s that she was cursed by the ghosts of those who were killed by bullets fired by Winchester rifles (hence the “most haunted” claim).  Hammer Films plans on starting filming in early 2015.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 FIFTY SHADES OF GREY TRAILER DEBUTS, FREAKS OUT THE UNFAMILIAR\n\nNormally, the Weekly Ketchup only covers film development news, which includes new projects, creative hirings, and casting, but what’s not included under that umbrella is promotion, such as posters and trailers. However, the exception to that rule every year is San Diego Comic-Con, where those sorts of stories are not only more condensed, but they’re also bigger. Ever since the Twilight phenomenon first started at SDCC, other franchises more popular with girls and women have joined the superheroic masses. That group includes E.L. James’ Fifty Shades of Grey, which started as Twilight fan fiction.  In addition to SDCC, the trailer is being publicized this week via such mainstream sources as The Today Show and Parade. The “Rotten” side of this story is that the trailer starts off seeming to tell one type of story, and then at the end, the freaky stuff starts showing up.  Parents are going to have a fun time explaining to their kids what goes on in Fifty Shades of Grey. Universal Pictures and Focus Features will release Fifty Shades of Grey on February 13, 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#1 PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN STILL SAILING ON WITH 5TH MOVIE IN 2017\n\nWhen Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was released in 2003, critics quite liked it (79% Fresh). The three sequels since then, however, have not fared as well, with the percentages progressively going down with each new film (54% to 45% to 33%). That’s why whenever there’s any PotC news, we have to pretty much include it as a Rotten Idea. This week, that news is that Walt Disney Pictures has officially announced a release date of July 7, 2017 for the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, which is sometimes listed with the subtitle Dead Men Tell No Tales. The bright side of this project is that it will be directed by the Kon-Tiki team of Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, but speaking of “tales,” there’s also an old saying concerning how difficult it is to put a shine on… well, you know. In this case, that might be the script, which was also written by Jeff Nathanson, whose credits include Coyote Ugly, Rush Hour 3, and Tower Heist. Johnny Depp is expected to once again play Captain Jack Sparrow.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Video","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-PreComicCon-Idris-Elba-Joins-Guy-Ritchies-King-Arthur"},{"id":"47509204487699","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Shane Black Signs on for New Predator Film","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Shane Black Signs on for New Predator Film\n                        Plus, new films for Channing Tatum, Sam Raimi, and Ben Kingsley, and a Snow White and the Huntsman spinoff.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 27, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes news about lots of sequels and franchise entries (including Predator, Beverly Hills Cop, and The Huntsman), new roles for Chris Hemsworth, Sir Ben Kingsley, and Channing Tatum, and new films for directors Sam Raimi and Tate Taylor.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nPREDATOR RETURNS\n\nAfter disappointing results for films like Red Dawn, Total Recall, and RoboCop, it’s possible that some in Hollywood are starting to get the message that there’s not really an audience champing at the bit for remakes of cherish genre classics. The question posed by this week’s biggest movie development news story is whether there’s still a way of reviving old franchises other than direct reboots/remakes. We speak, of course, of the news that Iron Man 3 and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang director Shane Black has signed with 20th Century Fox to bring back Predator. Shane Black also costarred in the first Predator as Hawkins, the first of the lead commandos — 27 year old spoilers! — to (appear to) be killed. Black will also write the treatment for the new Predator film before handing the screenplay to Fred Dekker, with whom he worked on The Monster Squad (which also came out in 1987).  Although the initial reports did call this new Predator film a “reboot,” Black was quick to correct that, saying, “As far as Fred and I are concerned anyway… why start over, when you’ve all this rich mythology yet to mine?,” continuing that he can “really get behind inventive sequels.” This will be the sixth Predator film, after three films in 1987, 1990, and 2010, the two Alien vs Predator movies in 2004 and 2007, and various appearances in comic books, novels, and video games. Besides this new project, Shane Black continues to work on his long-in-development adaptation of Doc Savage, about which he reportedly recent met with Thor star Chris Hemsworth (who also made the news this week, further down in the Ketchup).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 CHANNING TATUM TO WORK WITH THE COEN BROS ON HAIL CAESAR!\n\nThe recent box office success of 22 Jump Street over How to Train Your Dragon 2 was the latest achievement for Channing Tatum, who is increasingly looking like he is becoming a true “bankable” Hollywood movie star.  Tatum will also be starring with Steve Carell this fall in Foxcatcher, which is already one of the year’s early Awards season frontrunners (it premiered at Cannes last month). Tatum’s pursuit of critical and box office success appears to be continuing with the news this week that he’s going to costar in the next Coen Bros movie. Channing Tatum, Ralph Fiennes, and Tilda Swinton are all in talks to join the already cast duo of George Clooney and Josh Brolin in the Hollywood period comedy Hail, Caesar! In this ensemble comedy about 1950s Hollywood, Tatum will play a Gene Kelly-ish movie star, Fiennes will play a film director, and Swinton will play a “powerful Hollywood gossip columnist.” Hail, Caesar! will be distributed by Universal Pictures, probably in the fall of 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE GIANT ROBOTS AND KAIJU OF PACIFIC RIM WILL RETURN IN 2017\n\nWe’ve already known for a while that Guillermo del Toro was working on a sequel to last year’s robots-vs-kaiju monster movie Pacific Rim, but this week, the project was confirmed by that (sometimes reliable) bible of film development: the release schedule. Universal Pictures and Legendary Pictures have announced that Pacific Rim 2 will be released on April 7, 2017 in 3D and IMAX 3D theaters. Guillermo del Toro will again be directing, and is currently writing the script with Zak Penn (cowriter of The Incredible Hulk and Marvel’s The Avengers). Between now and 2017, del Toro will also be working on a Pacific Rim animated TV series, Pacific Rim graphic novels, The Strain TV series, and the haunted house film Crimson Peak, which Universal and Legendary are releasing on October 16, 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#3 SAM RAIMI TO DEPICT THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN IN THE OUTPOST\n\nDirector Sam Raimi became nearly synonymous in recent years with eye candy movies because of his three Spider-Man films, Disney’s Oz the Great and Powerful, and the horror film Drag Me to Hell. This week, Raimi came on board to produce and possibly direct an adaptation of a book by CNN reporter Jake Tapper which would be a departure from that career track. Tapper’s war memoir The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor describes a battle in 2009 at Combat Outpost Keating near the Afghanistan border with Pakistan. The 53 U.S. soldiers there found themselves surrounded by nearly 400 Taliban combatants in a bloody clash on October 3, 2009. If Sam Raimi does sign on to direct The Outpost, it will be his first war movie, following previous genre experiments with the thriller (A Simple Plan), the western (The Quick and the Dead), and sports movies (For Love of the Game).\n\n\n\t\n#4 THE HELP DIRECTOR TO IMAGINE THE WORST IN THE EVENT OF A MOON DISASTER\n\nEverything went so spectacularly well on the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969 that reactions to this day range from conspiracy theories to taking it for granted (the moon landing predates many of our readers’ births, obviously). There’s evidence that the success of Apollo 11 was far from a certainty in 1969 (and that’s supported by the events depicted in Apollo 13). When former White House speechwriter William Safire died in 2009, one of the documents found in his papers was a speech titled, “In Event of Moon Disaster.” The speech was to have been read by President Richard Nixon if something had gone wrong with the Apollo 11 mission. Now, the disaster that didn’t happen is going to be adapted as a fictional moon disaster movie with that very title. Tate Taylor, who became famous for directing The Help, and directed the upcoming James Brown biopic Get On Up, will direct and produce In Event of Moon Disaster. The project is on something of a fast track, with casting expected to start soon in preparation for an early 2015 filming start date. And speaking of Apollo 13, that film’s star Tom Hanks also made the news this week because he will have a “brief role” with frequent costar Meg Ryan in her directorial debut, called Ithaca.\n\n\n\t\n#5 SIR BEN KINGSLEY TO VOICE BAGHEERA THE PANTHER IN THE JUNGLE BOOK\n\nThe argument can certainly be made that the success of the Marvel movies is establishing artistic relationships that Disney is then able to apply to their other films. Take, for instance, the studio’s live action/CGI animated update of Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book. We already knew that The Jungle Book was going to be directed by Jon Favreau (Iron Man and Iron Man 2), and that Kaa the python would be voiced by Black Widow herself, Scarlett Johansson. This week, we also learned that a third Iron Man alumnus, Sir Ben Kingsley, will be providing the voice of the black panther Bagheera.  (Or, maybe, he’ll be playing the guy providing the voice of an animated panther. Epic Mandarin burn!)\n\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#4 SCOOT MCNAIRY BECOMES THE 14TH CAST MEMBER OF BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE\n\nObviously, if Warner Bros and DC Comics are serious about building their own cinematic universe to compete with Marvel, they’re going to be doing a lot of casting in the next few years. The argument can also be made that the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice cast is getting kind of crazy huge. We’ll just skip listing the other 13 actors by linking to Wikipedia, and focus on announcing that the 14th cast member of the movie will be the awesomely named Scoot McNairy.  Although most people don’t know the face or the name yet, McNairy does come to this movie with some interesting connections. He costarred with Ben Affleck in Argo, worked with the competition on Marvel One-Shot: Hail to the King, and starred in Monsters, the first film from Warner Bros’ darling and Godzilla director Gareth Edwards. We don’t know yet who Scoot McNairy will be playing in the DC movies, but top contenders include Green Lantern and the Flash, though for all we know, he might be playing Elongated Man, the Atom, The Creeper, Blue Beetle, or Booster Gold. And that’s why this is a borderline Rotten Idea… Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice nearly has more characters than would fit in three movies, much less one.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THE HUNTSMAN GETS HIS OWN SPINOFF MOVIE, SANS-SNOW WHITE\n\nThere was so much scandal about what was going on away from the cameras that the actual release of Snow White and the Huntsman almost seemed to be an afterthought. Of course, the movie brought in almost $400 million worldwide, so maybe the controversy helped, too. Universal was definitely left with some conundrums about how to carry on as if Snow White and the Huntsman was the start of a franchise. Their solution appears to be to drop the director, drop the Snow White, and give the world Frank Darabont’s The Huntsman. Frank Darabont is, of course, a well known genre figure because of his work on Stephen King adaptations like The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, and The Mist, and also for being the original showrunner on AMC’s The Walking Dead. Darabont’s not the reason this is a “Rotten Idea;” it’s because Snow White and the Huntsman had a Tomatometer rating of 48% (Rotten). Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron are expected to return in lead roles, but Kristen Stewart is not (though she may still have a very small cameo).\n\n\n\t\n#2 BRETT RATNER’S BEVERLY HILLS COP CONFIRMED FOR 2016\n\nThis week, the Michigan Film Office announced (and confirmed) that the fourth Beverly Hills Cop movie (which has the same title as the first film) will be filmed and set entirely in Detroit and Michigan. The premise is that, after decades of living and working in Beverly Hills, Axel Foley will have to return to the mean streets of Detroit. Paramount has scheduled Beverly Hills Cop for March 26, 2016, against the disaster movie Geostorm. Director Brett Ratner’s Tomatometer is the reason Beverly Hills Cop is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.\n\n\n\t\n#1 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL: THE FANTASTIC FOUR TO BE… A FOUND FOOTAGE MOVIE?\n\nObviously, if superhero movies are going to continue to dominate Hollywood, there is going to need to be evolution and experimentation, including new genres and approaches.  And maybe we should have seen this one coming when 20th Century Fox hired Chronicle director Josh Trank for their 6/19/15 reboot of The Fantastic Four. But here we are, as the president of production at Fox has revealed that the film will likely have “found footage elements… It’s Josh, so it can’t not have that feel.”  So, just imagine what that means… We’re going to have Reed Richards recording Johnny Storm and the Thing fighting their frustrations out on his GoPro. Yay? In other Marvel news, Edgar Ramirez of Deliver Us from Evil has revealed that he has been talking to Marvel about a role in Doctor Strange (possibly as the villain Baron Mordu, whom he sort of resembles?). And, yes, there was also the news about a Nathan Fillion cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy, but not as who he probably heard he’d be playing. Instead, there’s a rumor that Nathan Fillion might be voicing the Russian space dog Cosmo. Getting back on our Rotten headline for the close, what do the commenters think? Should the adventures of the Fantastic Four be depicted via “found footage”?\n\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"unscripted, Fantasy, kong, TV, TNT, HBO, Amazon, CBS, TBS, TV, caribbean","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Shane-Black-Signs-on-for-New-Predator-Film"},{"id":"47509206341160","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Man of Steel Sequel Casts Its Alfred and Lex Luthor","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Man of Steel Sequel Casts Its Alfred and Lex Luthor\n                        Plus, Fox finds a Gambit, Liam Neeson reteams with Martin Scorsese, and some Marvel sequel news.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 31, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes movie development news stories about new entries in franchises like Captain America, Riddick, Thor, and xXx, and new (possible) roles for Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Neeson, Channing Tatum, and Bruce Willis.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nJESSE EISENBERG AND JEREMY IRONS CAST AS LEX LUTHOR AND ALFRED\n\nThere’s been a few names bandied around in recent weeks and months about who might play Lex Luthor in the Man of Steel sequel, the most mentioned one being Joaquin Phoenix. Today, Warner Bros surprised pretty much everyone with the announcement that Jesse Eisenberg, star of The Social Network, has been cast as Lex Luthor. The news also came with the (less surprising) announcement that Jeremy Irons will play the new Alfred Pennyworth, following the most recent star, Michael Caine. The choice of Jesse Eisenberg almost asks more questions than it answers, but the biggest one is: exactly who is THIS Lex Luthor? If he’s a billionaire genius, what kind of billionaire? What kind of genius? Is this new Lex Luthor a “villain” at all? Or just a misunderstood man who uses his finances to address the alien in a blue suit who is the only one left standing after a battle that destroyed most of Metropolis? Warner Bros will release the still-untitled Batman/Superman movie on May 6, 2016.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 FROM “AS SEEN ON TV” TO “AS SEEN IN MOVIE THEATERS”: THE MIRACLE MOP MOVIE\n\nDirector David O. Russell (The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle) clearly likes working with the same actors repeatedly, with a recurring roster that includes Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, and Amy Adams. There were two stars (Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence) that appeared in both Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle and, as we learned this week, might do a third movie in a row with the director. David O. Russell is in talks with Fox 2000 to rewrite and direct an untitled drama about “Miracle Mop” inventor Joy Mangano, who Russell hopes will be played by Jennifer Lawrence. The Miracle Mop became an instant sensation on QVC in the early 1990s once Mangano started pitching the product herself (selling 18,000 mops in her first 20 minutes on air). The current script was written by Annie Mumolo, who cowrote Bridesmaids with Kristen Wiig. While David O. Russell works on the “Miracle Mop” biopic script, Jennifer Lawrence will be keeping busy with the two parts of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay and the remake of East of Eden.\n\n\n\t\n#2 LIAM NEESON BRINGS HIS VERY PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS TO MARTIN SCORSESE’S PRIEST EPIC SILENCE\n\nMartin Scorsese is preparing to soon start filming Silence, the adaptation of the Shusaku Endo novel about 17th century Jesuit priests in Japan. We continue to get casting announcements, with this story including our fourth and fifth actors, and they still aren’t Leonardo DiCaprio. The headline here is that Liam Neeson has signed on for one of the lead roles, which knocks off another of Scorsese’s bucket list of famous actors he probably wanted to work with (one more time) before he retires (or is retired by his own 71 year old mortality) — almost certainly coincidentally, Liam Neeson played a character called “Priest” in Gangs of New York.” Silence will start filming in Taiwan later this year, after Liam Neeson finishes filming the sequel Taken 3. Neeson joins the previously cast Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Issei Ogata (Yi Yi: A One and a Two), and Adam Driver (HBO’s Girls), who was actually cast two weeks ago (though that story wasn’t covered at the time by this column).\n\n\n\t\n#3 CAPTAIN AMERICA AND THOR BOTH CONFIRMED TO GET THIRD MOVIES\n\nSurprising probably no one, this week we heard confirmation that Marvel Studios is developing third movies for two  Avengers members, after, respectively, last November’s Thor: The Dark World and this April’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Brother team Anthony and Joe Russo, who also are known for directing many episodes of NBC’s Community, have signed to return for the third Captain America movie after also directing Captain America: The Winter Soldier. As for the third Thor movie, it will be cowritten by screenwriter Christopher Yost (who also cowrote Thor: The Dark World) and Craig Kyle, who serves as Senior Vice President of Production and Development at Marvel. Disney and Marvel have pegged a few “Untitled” slots on the release schedules for 2016 and 2017, and these two movies could end up on any of those dates (along with Doctor Strange).\n\n\n\t\n#4 CHANNING TATUM AS FOX’S NEW GAMBIT, MON AMI?\n\nThis summer will mark five years now since Taylor Kitsch costarred as Gambit in the cinematic trainwreck that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The inclusion of Gambit in that movie was part of what is continuing to be a “thing” for 20th Century Fox with their X-Men movies, which they cram with mutants, again and again. We were reminded of this this week as Empire magazine unveiled their TWENTY FIVE character covers for X-Men: Days of Future Past. Admittedly, 20th Century Fox does have a lot of characters under their deal with Marvel, and continuing to include these characters in the movies is one way of making sure the rights don’t lapse back to Marvel. On the other hand, another way to do that would be to just make more movies with fewer X-Men. This week, we learned that producer Lauren Shuler Donner has hopes that they might do just that for the cajun gambler Gambit. And Donner already has Channing Tatum on board the project (verbally, at least), saying, “It’s a thief in New Orleans, it’s a whole different story. He’s on board, and I have to get the studio on board. How can anyone resist Channing? He’s such a sweetheart.”\n\n\n\t\n#5 SETH ROGEN REVEALS THE VOICE CAST OF HIS HUGE SAUSAGE PARTY\n\nSpeaking of someone who was in This is the End (at this point, I’m not sure that can still be considered a spoiler, right, folks?), this week, Seth Rogen revealed the voice cast of his R-rated animated comedy, Sausage Party, and it includes many of the same people.  Sausage Party will be an animated adventure about a sausage trying to make his way across a supermarket during a 4th of July sale. We now know that the voice cast will include Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, Nick Kroll, David Krumholtz, and Edward Norton. Sony Pictures will release Sausage Party sometime in 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#6 THE SIXTH AARDMAN STUDIOS MOVIE WILL BE SHAUN THE SHEEP\n\nTwenty years after his first appearance in the Wallace &amp; Gromit short film A Close Shave, the clay character Shaun the Sheep will make his feature film debut in his own movie when it’s released in the UK on March 20, 2015. This news comes via the announcement this week that filming has started at the studio in Bristol.  The movie will be an expansion of the stop-motion-animated children’s television series which has aired over 100 episodes since first debuting in 2007. There is not yet any word on whether Shaun the Sheep will be released in the USA, but Aardman’s first five feature films all were, with the most recent being The Pirates! (March 28, 2012).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 VIN DIESEL TEASES THE INTERNET WITH NEW XXX AND RIDDICK SEQUELS\n\nVin Diesel loves his Twitter and Facebook accounts. This week, he used his “guns” to pound out some updates about new movies in two of the other, less fast and furious franchises he’s known for. Got that image in your mind? Good. Here’s the actual news, or teases of news, as it were: Vin Diesel has posted that the script for a new xXx movie is expected to be delivered to him next week.  The post also mentioned Katy Perry as a possible costar.  The star also posted (again, on Facebook) this week that he expects that Universal Pictures will want to “develop” another movie in the Riddick franchise, after the most recent film did fairly well at the international box office ($98 million from a production budget of $38 million).\n\n\t\n#2 TOPHER GRACE TO STAR IN BLUMHOUSE HORROR FILM HOME\n\nSometimes when stars are announced for a movie, commenters will ask why the story is “Rotten” because, hey, that given actor isn’t “Rotten.”  So, let’s be specific here. Home is the title of an upcoming haunted house movie to be directed by Dennis Iliadis, whose sole major film to date was the remake of The Last House on the Left (41% on the RT Tomatometer), and that’s why this story is Rotten.  Anyway, Topher Grace (from TV’s That 70s Show) and Patricia Clarkson are now signed to star in the aforementioned movie called Home for the Blumhouse production company (and Universal Pictures). Topher Grace will play a man recently released from a mental institute who inherits a mansion after his parents die.  And then… ghosts!\n\n\t\n#1 M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN’S LABOR OF LOVE IS LITERALLY CALLED LABOR OF LOVE\n\nHollywood’s slow-moving development cycle must be tortuous for many filmmakers, we get it. Screenwriters, producers, and directors spend years fine-tuning movies, and most often, the movies never actually get made, and those that do get produced might change greatly over those many years.  Back in 1993, way before The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, and way, way, way before The Happening and The Last Airbender, a young screenwriter who goes by the handle M. Night Shyamalan sold a script called Labor of Love to 20th Century Fox.  And there… the script sat for all of these past twenty years. This week, we learned that Shyamalan has finally procured the script to produce outside Fox, and it will be a reunion project with the star of his biggest hit. Bruce Willis will play a man from Philadelphia who sets out to walk across America to prove his love to the woman he loves… who is recently dead.

Included in the mix are dozens and dozens of remakes, as well as a few sequels, and we say good-bye to talents like Paul Walker, James Gandolfini, and Hayao Miyazaki.\n\n\n\n\t\nJANUARY: THE YEAR OF THE REMAKE GETS STARTED WITH… BEN-HUR?\n\nIt wasn’t a new thing in 2013 that there were a lot of news stories about remakes; Hollywood’s renewed reboot/remake frenzy has been going on for years now. What made 2013 stand out was the sheer number of remakes that made the news. Of the twelve months included in this Yearly Ketchup, for various reasons, only five of the stories are remakes, but there were so many more that could have been mentioned. And so, I will do exactly that, right here: In 2013, we saw stories about remakes of… 101 Dalmatians, The Abominable Snowman, Akira, Animal Farm, Annie, Beauty and the Beast, Ben-Hur, The Bible, Bloodsport, The Butterfly Effect, Cinderella, The Crow, Day of the Dead, The Diary of a Young Girl, Dracula, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, East of Eden, The Fantastic Four, Frankenstein, Friday the 13th, The Gambler, Godzilla, The Grapes of Wrath, Gremlins, Guys and Dolls, Hellraiser, Hercules (two different movies), How the Grinch Stole Christmas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Island of Dr. Moreau, Jacob’s Ladder, The Jungle Book (two different remakes), Kickboxer, Kiki’s Delivery Service, MacBeth, The Magnificent Seven, Marwencol, The Mummy, The Naked Gun, Oliver Twist, Peter Pan, Pete’s Dragon, Point Break, Poltergeist, Road House, Robin Hood, RoboCop, Scarface, Scooby-Doo, The Taming of the Shrew, Tarzan, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Terminator, TimeCop, Tomb Raider, The Toxic Avenger, Trollhunter, The Twilight Zone, Weird Science, and… The Wild Bunch. So, maybe, as you the reader recover from some of the shocks included in that previous sentence, it serves to lessen the blow about our January entry: MGM is remaking Ben-Hur. And they didn’t just give up on it within a few months, because we also learned in August that Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter) was hired for the remake. January also had some bad news for another Ben (Affleck, specifically), who was snubbed by the Academy in the Best Director category, an oversight that was ultimately vindicated when Argo was the year’s Best Picture winner.\n\n\n\t\nFEBRUARY: NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM TO GET OBLIGATORY THIRD MOVIE\n\nNot all of the predictable retreads in 2013 came from remakes. There were plenty of predictable sequels announced, too. Most of them aren’t included in this column because, frankly, a lot of the original movies were not horrible (or at least, their RT Tomatometer scores aren’t “Rotten”). One franchise that has been met with box office success (over $990 million worldwide), but not critical acclaim (and hence its inclusion here) is 20th Century Fox’s Night at the Museum and its sequel. I tried watching the first film once… wow. Kids, however, seem to love all the monsters and Robin Williams and such. And so, the pieces are coming together for Night at the Museum 3, which 20th Century Fox has already scheduled for release on Christmas Day, 2014. Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, and Ricky Gervais are all returning as well.\n\n\n\t\nMARCH: RESIDENT EVIL, LIKE ITS ZOMBIE HORDES, JUST REFUSES TO STAY DEAD\n\nIt’s taken a few more movies, but Sony’s Resident Evil franchise has also made nearly a billion dollars in worldwide release with the five movies thus far. In March, we learned that the studio (and director/producer Paul W.S. Anderson) are working on a sixth movie, probably in the hopes that they will top the billion dollar mark. There was also talk in 2013 of a seventh movie, but that one is expected to possibly be a reboot of the franchise, without Anderson directing. Heck, maybe with the reboot, they can even try making movies that more closely resemble the video game franchise from which the movies borrow their title and loose concepts. Sony Pictures had previously scheduled Resident Evil 6 for release on September 12, 2014, but it’s looking at this point like it will be delayed until sometime in early 2015.\n\n\n\t\nAPRIL: CHOOSE YOUR OWN LEAST FAVORITE REMAKE: WEIRD SCIENCE OR POINT BREAK\n\nIn trying to represent the worst ideas of each month in the year, sometimes a writer just can’t choose one. In April, which remake was the worse idea, Weird Science or Point Break? How you decide might depend upon your own personal opinion of what sorts of movies should be remade, but also your own opinion of the two original films.  One popular approach is that remakes should be reserved for films that were not all that great the first time around.  The idea of fitting a Weird Science remake into that logic is challenged by the fact that the original film is not universally cherished or derided, with a Tomatometer score of 56%.  What might help the Weird Science remake is that the writer challenged with the task has a few good films to his credit (like 21 Jump Street and Scott Pilgrim vs the World). It’s still a Weird Science remake, though. Your other candidate for April is the Point Break remake, which has been in development for a few years now, but the news in 2013 was basically that it’s still in development.  We would say more about Point Break, but this column only has room for so much Patrick Swayze, and there’s still more to come…\n\n\n\t\nMAY: ROLL A SAFETY THROW VERSUS REMAKES OF DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS\n\nSpeaking of choosing your own adventure, according to some sources (like the recent book Of Dice and Men), we’re in the middle of a resurgence in popularity for that grand daddy of P-n-P role playing games, Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Anyway, it was in May that we learned that Warner Bros is looking at reviving/rebooting their Dungeons &amp; Dragons film series, which has spent most of its time in WB’s direct-to-video division.   The current approach is actually an adaptation of the Chainmail game, which was E. Gary Gygax’s precursor to D&amp;D. That script is being worked on by a screenwriter whose previous films include Red Riding Hood and Wrath of the Titans. Almost certainly coincidentally, May was also the month when we heard about plans for a movie inspired by the Medieval Times chain of theme restaurants.\n\n\t\nJUNE: IT WOULDN’T BE A ROTTEN IDEA RECAP COLUMN WITHOUT ADAM SANDLER\n\nThe sun rises, the sun sets, the tides ebb and flow, and Adam Sandler continues to star in movies that critics hate. In 2013, the new Adam Sandler movies we heard about included the project at Universal Pictures called Hello Ghost, which will be a remake of a South Korean supernatural comedy about a man haunted by four ghosts after attempting to kill himself. We even found a picture of Adam Sandler pretending to shoot himself, and everything. There was another Adam Sandler story in 2013, the September news about an indie movie called The Cobbler, but the weird thing there is that it teams up Adam Sandler, all Punch-Drunk Love style, with a director (Tom McCarthy) normally known for delivering (get this) movies beloved by critics and audiences like The Station Agent, The Visitor, and Win Win.\n\n\n\t\nJULY: WARNER BROS SKIPPING A WONDER WOMAN MOVIE AND GOING STRAIGHT TO THE FLASH\n\nThis story was informed quite a bit later in the year when Gal Gadot was announced as playing Wonder Woman in her live action feature film debut in the Man of Steel sequel, but even that arguably just supports the concern here. But we’re probably getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s start by reminding readers that in July, 2013, Warner Bros and DC Comics sort of staged a San Diego Comic-Con blitzkrieg, with lots of big announcements about their feature films, with the biggest being that Batman (later revealed to be Ben Affleck) would be a big part of the Man of Steel sequel.  That movie was announced for 2015, a Justice League movie for 2017, and in between in 2016, there is a planned movie for The Flash. The problem that many people immediately picked up on was that there was no mention of Wonder Woman, who had been waiting for her feature film debut for over seventy years now. There’s nothing inherently wrong with The Flash, of course, but his fandom just doesn’t compare. When girls and women like Wonder Woman, they usually LOVE Wonder Woman. Instead of her own movie, what she currently is settling for is being the third (at best) player in a sequel to a Superman movie. Warner Bros has scheduled the still-untitled Man of Steel sequel for July 17, 2015, just two weeks before Marvel’s Ant-Man. Speaking of the Man of Steel sequel…\n\n\n\t\nAUGUST: THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY OF THE YEAR: THE FOOTNOTE THAT IS BEN AFFLECK’S DIRECTORIAL CAREER\n\nAmidst all of the online craziness that was the reaction to the casting of Ben Affleck as Batman in the Man of Steel sequel, there seemed to be a disappointing subtext that many writers forgot to reflect upon. Namely, that if Ben Affleck spends the next several years running around in a grey and black Batsuit, he’s going to have a lot, lot, lot less time to actually direct his own movies. The irony here is that we’re talking about the very same year when Ben Affleck the director was hailed almost universally for his work on Argo. And so, the reward his directorial career ends 2013 with is… he will get to direct a lot less movies? That logic is a little messed up. Amidst the movies that Ben Affleck may never get to direct (or will have to wait to do so) are his planned projects directing Dennis Lehane’s Live by Night, the remake of the French thriller Tell No One, and the big screen adaptation of Stephen King’s The Stand.\n\n\n\t\nSEPTEMBER: HAYAO MIYAZAKI CONFIRMS PLANS TO RETIRE FROM DIRECTING THE BEST ANIME MOVIES EVER\n\nThe announcement that really kept Ben Affleck’s stalled career as director from being one of the biggest stories of the year might have been the revelation that one of cinema’s most heralded talents is calling it quits. We are speaking, of course, of Japanese anime director Hayao Miyazaki, who with films like Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, and Spirited Away, seemed to elevate the form above cliche and stereotype. His last film as director will be The Wind Rises, which will be released in the USA on February 21, 2014.\n\n\n\t\nOCTOBER: MINI-SERIES, WEBSITES, AND 8TH GRADE HOMEWORK, OH MY!\n\nOctober was another month where this writer just couldn’t decide which story was more over-the-top awful and misguided. Your candidates begin with Son of God, which 20th Century Fox will release on February 28, 2014. This “movie” about Jesus Christ was produced by Mark Burnett and Roma Downey and stars Diogo Morgado and a guy who kind of resembles Barack Obama (as Satan). If it sounds a lot like a few episodes of that popular mini-series The Bible, well, there’s a reason for that: it’s because that is exactly what Son of God is — a few episodes of The Bible re-edited into feature length, with a few deleted scenes added back in. But wait, there’s more!  In October, 20th Century Fox also announced plans for a trilogy of movies based on three websites: The Knot (about marriage), The Bump (and pregancy), and The Nest (about parenthood). The three movies are expected to be “loosely thematically connected ensemble comedies” in the tradition of such films based on non-narrative works as What to Do When You’re Expecting and Think Like a Man. Finally, in the final days of October, DreamWorks took some of the burden from 20th Century Fox by announcing their own awful plans for a movie in the form of Popular: One Geek’s Quest for the Impossible, which was a “book” that started as an 8th grader’s journal (though its theme and publication sounds a bit too staged, the cynical mind could speculate). As if someone wanted to land a movie deal.\n\n\n\t\nNOVEMBER: THE REGURGITATION OF PATRICK SWAYZE’S CAREER CONTINUES WITH ROAD HOUSE\n\nThere’s a thing that sometimes happens in Hollywood in the years after a celebrity’s death. Sometimes, the death leads to a biopic, and sometimes, their movies or books or whatever start getting a lot more feature film adaptations.  Patrick Swayze died in 2009, and that was the start of a series of movie remakes that is getting closer and closer to covering almost every major film he starred in. We’ve already seen a remake of Red Dawn, and there are remakes in development of Dirty Dancing and the previously mentioned Point Break. All we’re really missing at this point is Ghost, Uncommon Valor, The Outsiders, and To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar. That’s especially true now that there’s a remake of Road House in the works.\n\n\n\t\nDECEMBER: R.I.P. PAUL WALKER (AND JAMES GANDOLFINI, AND DENNIS FARINA, AND PETER O’TOOLE, AND…)\n\nObviously, it’s one of the ultimate facts of life that we lose people — some really great people — every year. 2013 neared its end with one of the most shocking losses in recent memory, one that you probably have to go back to Heath Ledger to match. It was in the first days of December that we learned of the automobile crash death of Paul Walker, the star of the Fast and Furious franchise. Walker was just 40, and did not have a history of alcoholism, drug abuse, etc, which sometimes take from us our favorite talents. We lost a lot of talented actors in 2013, such as James Gandolfini, Dennis Farina, and Peter O’Toole, just to name a few. Paul Walker’s death might have been included anyway, but in particular, because it’s led to the delay of Fast &amp; Furious 7 to 2015, the news was directly related to big movie development news.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"drama","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Yearly-Ketchup-The-Most-Rotten-Stories-of-2013"},{"id":"47509206324766","title":"Weekly Ketchup: The Divergent Trilogy Will Be Split Into Four Movies","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: The Divergent Trilogy Will Be Split Into Four Movies\n                        Plus, Possible Casting News for Bond 24\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 11, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes movie development news stories for the superhero movies Mystique, the sequels for James Bond and Star Wars, the TV show adaptations Kung Fu and Battlestar Galactica, and new roles for Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Keanu Reeves.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nLIONSGATE ANNOUNCES FOURTH MOVIE IN DIVERGENT TRILOGY\n\nWhen Warner Bros. first announced plans to expand the seven Harry Potter books into a total of eight movies, they started a new trend for YA franchise adaptations that Lionsgate has been repeating ever since (first with The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 and next with The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2). This week, we learned that Lionsgate will be adding a fourth finale movie to the Veronica Roth books that hit the big screen last month with Divergent. The plan is one Divergent movie each March, starting with Insurgent (Mar. 20, 2015), followed by Allegiant Part 1 (Mar. 18, 2016), and concluding with Allegiant Part 2 (Mar. 24, 2017). Shailene Woodley will star in all four movies. Neil Burger, who dropped out of the franchise after directing Divergent, was replaced for Insurgent by Robert Schwentke, whose most recent film was last summer’s R.I.P.D.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 FROM 12 YEARS A SLAVE TO JAMES BOND #24 FOR CHIWETEL EJIOFOR? \n\nChiwetel Ejiofor may have lost the Best Actor race to Matthew McConaughey, but that doesn’t mean that the British actor isn’t reaping rewards for his work in the Best Picture 12 Years a Slave. Sources at MGM and Sony have told Variety that Chiwetel Ejiofor is the top choice to play the villain in the next installment (#24) of the James Bond film franchise — though nothing is official. Daniel Craig will be returning for his fourth film as James Bond, and he will be joined by returning cast members Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, and Naomi Harris. The newest Bond film will be directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), who also directed Skyfall, and the movie is already scheduled for release on Nov. 6, 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#2 JENNIFER LAWRENCE MIGHT GET HER OWN SPINOFF FILM AS MYSTIQUE\n\nBesides next month’s X-Men: Days of Future Past, we already know about the 1980s-set X-Men: Apocalypse (May 26, 2016), a third Wolverine solo movie (Mar. 3, 2017), plans for an X-Force movie, and possible solo movies for Deadpool and Gambit. This week, for the first time, there was confirmation from franchise producer Lauren Shuler Donner that another popular X-character might also be getting her own solo spinoff movie: Mystique, the shape-shifting mutant as played by Jennifer Lawrence. Writer/producer Simon Kinberg (X-Men: First Class) confirmed interest, saying, “I love what Jen Lawrence has done with her, and I feel like because she is in such a crowded ensemble, there’s so much more opportunity if you were to follow her solo.” Rebecca Romijn played Mystique in the first three X-Men movies, which are set in a different period (and possibly a different timeline) than the two movies in which Jennifer Lawrence has appeared as Mystique so far.\n\n\n\t\n#3 TINA FEY AND AMY POEHLER REUNITE AS SISTERS IN THE NEST\n\nSaturday Night Live alumns Tina Fey and Amy Poehler work together so regularly that they will eventually need sections of their Wikipedia pages devoted to the other. Some examples of their professional partnership include anchoring “Weekend Update” on SNL, starring opposite each other in the 2008 comedy Baby Mama, and co-hosting the last two editions of the Golden Globes. And now, we know that Amy Poehler is in final negotiations to join Tina Fey in the Universal Pictures comedy The Nest. They will play two adult sisters who spend one last weekend in their childhood home after their parents put the house up for sale. The Nest will be directed by Jason Moore (Pitch Perfect) from a script by Paula Pell, a longtime member of the Saturday Night Live writing staff.\n\n\n\t\n#4 PETER MAYHEW RETURNING AS CHEWBACCA IN STAR WARS EPISODE VII\n\nFilming has already started on Star Wars Episode VII, but except for returning stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford — along with Girls‘ star Adam Driver as a villain — Disney has kept most of the cast a secret. This week, however, the studio confirmed a fourth returning cast member, and it’s Peter Mayhew, the 69-year-old (and 7-foot-tall) British actor known for playing Han Solo’s Wookiee friend Chewbacca.  No other details have been revealed yet, but one good guess is that 30 years after Return of the Jedi, Chewbacca is possibly showing his age (cue the Star Wars fans who actually know his age). Anthony Daniels is also expected to return as C-3PO, but that hasn’t officially been confirmed yet. We also learned this week that Star Wars Episode VII will be filming for four weeks starting in May in Abu Dhabi, which is almost certainly going to be for scenes set on Tattooine, Luke Skywalker’s home planet. Walt Disney Pictures will release Star Wars Episode VII on Dec. 18, 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#5 KEANU REEVES TO ASK “WHO’S THERE?” IN KNOCK KNOCK FOR DIRECTOR ELI ROTH \n\nHorror director  Eli Roth has mostly avoided working with big movie stars on movies like Cabin Fever, Hostel, and The Green Inferno, but that will be changing with his next film, a psychological thriller called Knock Knock. Keanu Reeves will play a happily married man whose life is turned upside down when two young women (Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas) show up at his house while the family is away. Eli Roth starts filming Knock Knock in Santiago, Chile on Apr. 14th. \n\n\t\n#6 CLASSIC 1980S SCIENCE FICTION COMIC BOOK DREADSTAR NOW IN DEVELOPMENT \n\nHe may not be as famous as some of Marvel’s other creators, but comic book writer and artist Jim Starlin had a remarkable run at Marvel in the 1970s, and you could argue that we wouldn’t be getting Guardians of the Galaxy without him. Jim Starlin gave the characters Captain Mar-Vell and Adam Warlock the “cosmic” revisions they’re famous for, and also co-created Shang-Chi, Guardians of the Galaxy members Drax the Destroyer and Gamora, and cosmic super villain Thanos (the purple guy at the end of The Avengers). As with most characters created for Marvel, all of it remains the company’s property. In the 1980s, however, Jim Starlin created his own long-running “space opera” title for Marvel-owned Epic Comics which was character-owned, and this week, that creation Dreadstar got its own movie deal. Production companies Benderspink (We’re the Millers, A History of Violence) and Illuminati Entertainment are teaming up for Dreadstar, which tells the story of the last survivor of the Milky Way galaxy, Vanth Dreadstar, who teams up with a motley band that includes a mystic, a telepath and a cat-man-alien. In related news this week, Nathan Fillion revealed he might have a small role in Guardians of the Galaxy, saying, “Maybe check the credits of the movie when you watch it.” That could either mean he appears in the movie’s credits scene, or that his role is so obscure, you would only know what it is by looking for his name.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 MATT DAMON MIGHT STAR IN GRAVITY-ESQUE SPACE SURVIVAL ADVENTURE THE MARTIAN\n\nThe downside to a movie being as successful as Gravity was last fall is that Hollywood then starts greenlighting similar movies, hoping that lightning can strike the same spot twice. That reasoning is why this story is one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas,” but only a borderline one, since the movie in question, The Martian, might end up being awesome on its own merits. Matt Damon is being eyed by 20th Century Fox as a potential star for The Martian, which is about a stranded survivor of a manned mission to Mars who is left behind on the planet and must figure out a way back to Earth. The Martian was formerly a project for director Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods), but Goddard has left The Martian to focus his time on developing The Sinister Six for Sony, which he is in talks to direct, possibly for release in 2017. (Drew Goddard has been working on The Sinister Six as writer and likely director since last fall.)\n\n\t\n#2 THIS WEEK IN MOVIES BASED ON 1970S TV SHOWS: KUNG FU, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA\n\nIt may have been a coincidence, but this week saw news for two different (previously announced) projects at Universal Pictures based on genre TV shows from the 1970s. The one that you probably saw the most about on your Facebook feed is the movie reboot of Battlestar Galactica, the NBC series that premiered in 1978 as an obvious reaction to the success of Star Wars. Director Bryan Singer was previously attached to the reboot, but it appears that he departed to focus his time and energy on his various X-Men projects at Fox. Universal has hired screenwriter Jack Paglen (Transcendence, Prometheus 2) to work on the screenplay following Singer’s departure. The other 1970s TV show adaptation at Universal to make the news this week is the Kung Fu movie, which Baz Luhrmann (The Great Gatsby, Moulin Rouge) is now in talks to direct. The addition of a director with such a strong visual flair is certainly interesting for a project that most people had probably forgotten even existed, but… then you remember what Baz Luhrmann’s RT Tomatometer page looks like these days. Both of these movies are “Rotten Ideas” because, really — why is Hollywood still adapting 1970s TV shows?\n\n\t\n#1 GERARD BUTLER TO STAR IN METEOROLOGICAL DISASTER MOVIE GEOSTORM\n\nIn this last entry, we’re going to consider two movies that would seem to have absolutely nothing in common, except that they really do. Back in the 1990s, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin had a partnership that gave us the strange trio of Stargate, Independence Day, and Godzilla. Again, coincidentally, this week saw two different movies announced for each of them. Let’s start with Dean Devlin’s Geostorm. The Warner Bros. science fiction adventure has Gerard Butler attached to star as a “stubborn but charming satellite designer, who when the world’s climate-controlling satellites malfunction, has to work together with his estranged brother to save the world from  a man-made storm of epic proportions. A trip into space follows, while on Earth a plot to assassinate the president begins to unfold.” Dean Devlin wrote and will direct Geostorm. Roland Emmerich’s news story this week doesn’t seem as ridiculous — at first — and then you remember that the director is Roland Emmerich, who seems outs of his depths with Stonewall, the story of the 1969 police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a popular bar for New York’s gay and transgender community. The incident, which went on to be known as the “Stonewall Riots,” is an important event in the history of gay rights. But for the guy who gave us 10,000 B.C. and the 1998 Godzilla? Noble, but still a “Rotten Idea.” Jeremy Irvine of War Horse is the first actor to sign on.\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"TCA, Globe, El, Amazon","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-The-Divergent-Trilogy-Will-Be-Split-Into-Four-Movies"},{"id":"47509206344234","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Star Wars Episode VII Details Revealed","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Star Wars Episode VII Details RevealedPlus, casting news for upcoming Marvel movies, a Magic: The Gathering film, and new roles for Harrison Ford and Meryl Streep.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 17, 2014 |  CommentsWe’re now halfway into January, but Hollywood had another slow news week, possibly because so many movie industry types were preparing for their annual skiing vac… err, make that “the wonderful celebration of independent filmmaking known as the Sundance Film Festival.” Movies that made the cut this week include Marvel’s Ant-Man and Doctor Strange, and Magic: The Gathering.This Week’s Top StorySTAR WARS EPISODE VII TO FOCUS ON THE ADVENTURES OF HAN, LEIA, AND LUKEWhen Disney first announced plans for a new trilogy starting with Star Wars Episode VII, the general understanding seemed to be that the movies would focus on a new generation, including the adult children of Han Solo and Princess Leia. There have been, however, rewrites since then, and this week, we learned that one big change in the process has been a decision (by J.J. Abrams and others) to focus the attention more on three of the characters that audiences already know: Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Luke Skywalker. There was lots of other news this week, but that right there is huge news for fans who had sort of resigned themselves to another three movies of new characters that seem to take away from the characters they fell in love with first. Of course, we’re just talking about Star Wars Episode VII, with Episodes 8 and 9 possibly doing exactly that, but at least 7 will be more of a transition film. Speaking of new characters, the casting process continues, with lots of names bandied about, some of which might be for the same roles. The growing list of names now includes Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael B. Jordan, Jack O’Connell, Alex Pettyfer, Saoirse Ronan and Sullivan Stapleton. This week, Adam Driver*, Michael Fassbender, and Hugo Weaving were added in one report, while Jesse Plemons (Todd from Breaking Bad) was mentioned in another. And that’s just some of the names mentioned in recent months, although no one other than the returning stars (Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill) are officially confirmed yet. Filming starts in a couple of months, so we should soon start getting inundated with stories. (* It’s not Star Wars, but Adam Driver from HBO’s Girls also joined the cast of Martin Scorsese’s Silence this week).Fresh Developments This Week#1 GRAVITY, AMERICAN HUSTLE, AND 12 YEARS A SLAVE ARE TOP ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATED FILMSStrictly speaking, this story is not about movie development, but a) it was a slow news week, and b) it’s the freakin’ Academy Awards. If you’re reading this, you’re probably very into movies, which means this isn’t really “news” to you, but yes, indeed, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences announced the nominees for the 86th Academy Awards this week (which they’re still, annoyingly, calling “the 86th Oscars”). The two movies with the most nominations (ten each) were American Hustle and Gravity, with 12 Years a Slave being close behind with nine. Those three were followed by another three films which all received six nominations: Captain Phillips, Dallas Buyers Club, and Nebraska. Her and The Wolf of Wall Street each received five nominations. Those eight films were joined by one other, Philomena (which received four nominations), in the Best Picture race. The 86th Academy Awards will be held on Sunday, March 2, 2014.&nbsp;#2 BRUCE DERN AND CHRISTOPH WALTZ MIGHT BE 1/4 OF QUENTIN TARANTINO’S THE HATEFUL EIGHTLate last year, Quentin Tarantino first revealed to Jay Leno that his next film would be another Western. This week, we learned that the title of the script QT is working on is The Hateful Eight, and we also learned who two of the actors are that Tarantino is writing the script for (which has long been his writing process). The title hints at eight characters, and one of them might be Bruce Dern, who had a small role in Django Unchained, and is currently nominated for an Academy Award for Alexander Payne’s Nebraska. The other is Christoph Waltz, who Quentin Tarantino sort of helped put on the map with a starmaking role in Inglourious Basterds, and also a lead role in Django Unchained. Of course, Quentin Tarantino also sometimes takes years working on scripts, so a lot could change by the time filming starts.&nbsp;#3 MICHAEL DOUGLAS JOINS PAUL RUDD TO PLAY THE ORIGINAL ANT-MANMarvel Studios is now making so many superhero movies that they are moving on from their strengths to actually doing things that DC Comics is traditionally known for. Specifically, there is the concept of the “legacy hero” which DC Comics has used repeatedly as a way of changing superheroes for changing times, with a new generation taking on a superhero identity from the previous one. This allows (some) characters to age gracefully, as the original heroes age with their reading audience. In the movies, however, it’s something we seen done only rarely (though 1998’s The Mask of Zorro is one movie that did it). When Paul Rudd was announced recently as the star of Marvel’s Ant-Man, there was some confusion about which version he would be playing, and now we know clearly the answer. Michael Douglas has been cast as the original Ant-Man, inventor Dr. Henry Pym, who invents a suit that allows him to shrink and grow and, you know, fight crime. Director Edgar Wright has been hinting for years that he would do exactly this, with the film likely to have “a prologue where you see Pym as Ant-Man in action in the 60’s, in sort of ‘Tales to Astonish’ mode basically, and then the contemporary, sort of flash-forward, is Scott Lang’s story, and how he comes to acquire the suit, how he crosses paths with Henry Pym, and then, in an interesting sort of Machiavellian way, teams up with him.” This approach also resolves the lingering questions of how Edgar Wright might handle some of the seedier sides of Henry Pym’s back story. With filming scheduled to start this spring in Georgia, casting of other roles is also underway, with Michael Pena and Clifton Collins Jr. mentioned this week as possible costars (in unknown roles).&nbsp;#4 BY THE HOARY HOSTS OF HOGGOTH: JOHNNY DEPP AS MARVEL’S DOCTOR STRANGE?Online movie sites have been around for so long now (since the late 1990s) that we can sort of take it for granted that some/many of them are basically as established with studio publicists as any print publication (or more so). There are, however, still some independent voices out there that take chances other sites won’t, and when they’re right, they get huge exclusive scoops. One such site that has done that (with varying results) in recent years is Latino Review, which this week broke a story about Marvel’s Doctor Strange. The story which was subsequently picked up (but not confirmed) by Variety is that Marvel is talking to Johnny Depp about possibly starring as Doctor Strange in an upcoming solo movie (and probably other movies, too). Doctor Strange is one of Marvel’s classic 1960s characters, cocreated by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee (the same team responsible for Spider-Man), and Marvel’s “Sorcerer Supreme” who is the go-to-expert on all things magical. The thing to remember is that just because his name is Strange, doesn’t mean that he himself is “strange” (ie, not in a wacky Johnny Depp way), though he does wear a big red cape and a rockin’ 1970s mustache. However, if frequent Disney star Depp does sign on, Marvel will have another big name for their films to help balance out the inevitable departures of Marvel regulars like Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.&nbsp;#5 AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON GETS ANOTHER VILLAINWith Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel’s Phase 2 will be coming to a close, and as such, it’s to be expected that there will continue to be “world building” and foreshadowing for future Marvel movies. The title obviously tells us that the main villain will be the robot Ultron, but we learned this week that the terrorist organization HYDRA will also play a role in the movie. We know that now because Thomas Kretschman (Van Helsing in NBC’s Dracula) has been cast as HYDRA leader Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker. Baron Von Strucker is not currently a household name for non-comics-fans, but his back story as an enemy of both Nick Fury and Captain America (and related heroes) is quite epic. What people probably need to know is that Baron Von Strucker was 1) a Nazi from World War II, 2) who doesn’t age, but he is 3) bald with 4) a huge facial scar, 5) a metal glove weapon called the Satan Claw, and 6) a penchant for green outfits for himself and his various henchmen. Marvel Studios has scheduled Avengers: Age of Ultron for release on May 1, 2015.&nbsp;#6 HARRISON FORD JOINS BENJAMIN BUTTON-ISH FANTASY THE AGE OF ADALINEIn the same week in which it was revealed that Harrison Ford might be very busy in the 2014 with Star Wars Episode VII, the 71-year-old actor signed onto another movie which starts filming earlier in the year. Ford has joined the cast of the Lionsgate romantic drama The Age of Adaline, to be directed by Lee Toland Krieger (The Vicious Kind, Celeste and Jess Forever). Harrison Ford joins the already cast Ellen Burstyn and Blake Lively, who will be playing the title character, a woman who stops aging at 29, leading to an “isolated worldwide journey” through the 20th century. The Age of Adaline starts filming in March, and Star Wars Episode VII starts filming sometime later in the spring of 2014 (though it will be a long shoot, so Harrison Ford might not be needed right away).&nbsp;#7 A MAGIC: THE GATHERING MOVIE IS IN THE CARDS AT 20TH CENTURY FOXPeter Jackson’s film trilogy of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit is obviously one movie away from completion, Legendary’s Warcraft movie recently started filming, and Warner Bros is rebooting their Dungeons &amp; Dragons film franchise. It’s not the same attention given to comic books, but Hollywood has definitely not completely abandoned the fantasy hobbyist fascinations of Generation X (and older millenials). This week, one of the biggest gaming phenomenons of the 1990s got its own movie deal, when it was announced that 20th Century Fox is developing a project based on Magic: The Gathering. First published in 1993, Magic: The Gathering created a new kind of “collectible card game,” in which some of the “best” cards were also the rarest, encouraging players to spend a lot of $$$ in pursuit of their dream deck. The success of MTG led to dozens of similar games, with the most popular competitor probably being the Pokemon Trading Card Game. The game’s original publisher Wizards of the Coast (now owned by Hasbro) always stressed a concept of worldbuilding and narrative (including spinoff novels and comic books), so there’s definitely material available to inspire a feature film. To help guide the Magic: The Gathering movie through development, 20th Century Fox has recruited writer-producer Simon Kinberg, who is already busy at the studio working on their Marvel franchises Fantastic Four and X-Men. At this point, Simon Kinberg is producing Magic: The Gathering, and it’s not known if he will eventually adapt the screenplay as well.&nbsp;#8 HARVEY WEINSTEIN’S MRS. STREEP GOES TO WASHINGTON IN THE SENATOR’S WIFEFirst off, it should strongly be emphasized that the following story originates from a recent interview on Howard Stern’s radio show. Which is not to say that there’s no truth to the story, but just that if there’s anywhere where one might be more conversational, and less didactic than, say, a prepared press release, the Howard Stern show would be one example of that. Now that you’re properly prepared, here’s the story: famous movie producer Harvey Weinstein revealed this week that he and Meryl Streep are working on a movie about gun rights in American politics. Specifically, referring to the National Rifle Association, Weinstein said, “going to wish they weren’t alive after I’m done with them.” The movie will be a drama in the tradition of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and will be called The Senator’s Wife. Weinstein continued with, “Gun stocks ? I don’t want to be involved in that stuff. It’s going to be like crash and burn.” This story first appeared in conservative newspaper The Washington Times.&nbsp;#9 IN A SLOW MOVIE DEVELOPMENT NEWS WEEK, LET’S END THIS THING WITH… RELEASE DATESThe beginning of each year in Hollywood is an opportunity for each studio to tease their future plans, both for that calendar year, and also for the future past that. And so, in what was otherwise a slow news week, a few of the stories were about release dates, which we will cover briefly here in loose chronological order. “&gt;September, 2014 release dates were announced for the Reese Witherspoon Sudanese refugee drama The Good Lie (9/10/14) and the Tom Hardy/Noomi Rapace/James Gandolfini crime drama The Drop (formerly called Animal Rescue) (9/19/14). 20th Century Fox announced several new dates, including the comedy Let’s Be Cops (8/13/14), the remake of Poltergeist (2/13/15), and the third in their current franchise of Planet of the Apes reboot movies (7/29/16). Finally, Universal Pictures and the CGI animation studio Illumination Entertainment announced dates for three upcoming movies. First, there is an untitled musical comedy from director Garth Jennings (Son of Rambow) on December 21, 2016, followed by the sequel Despicable Me 3 on June 30, 2017, and their new animated version of Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas on November 17, 2017. It’s worth noting that Despicable Me 3 should not be confused with the previously announced Minions spinoff movie, which Universal and Illumination have scheduled for July 10, 2015.Rotten Ideas of the WeekSome of the finer points included above might be debatable, but we’re going to say that one side effect of a week with fewer movie development stories is that there weren’t enough movies for any of them to be considered “Rotten Ideas.” Enjoy it while it lasts.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"discovery, America, BBC, Warner, Walt, MSNBC, Disney, Adventures, Dates, furious","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-star-wars-episode-vii-details-revealed"},{"id":"47509207964215","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Charlie Hunnam Drops Out of Fifty Shades of Grey","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Charlie Hunnam Drops Out of Fifty Shades of Grey\n                        Plus, new roles for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Paul Rudd, Josh Brolin, Dwayne Johnson, and Will Ferrell.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 18, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes development news stories about movies about earthquakes (San Andreas), dinosaurs (Jurassic World), Jesus (Son of God), toy cars (Hot Wheels), the Mexican “Day of the Dead” holiday, and a very tiny superhero (Ant-Man).  There’s also new roles for Russell Crowe, Will Ferrell, and Dwayne Johnson.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nCHARLIE HUNNAM DROPS OUT OF FIFTY SHADES OF GREY\n\nWe’re accustomed to hearing about big paydays for people like Will Smith, Charlie Sheen, and Tom Cruise, but not every TV or movie actor rakes in the dough. That said, one would think that starring in a highly anticipated adaptation of a best selling novel which requires the lead actors to perform sex scenes might fetch a tidy sum. Which leads us to this week’s big story that Charlie Hunnam (Pacific Rim, TV’s Sons of Anarchy) has dropped out of starring as Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey.  There are a lot of details in that linked article indicating why Hunnam might have left the project, but one has to wonder how much of it had to do with the revelation that he was only going to be paid $125,000 for the role. That number’s amazing for most jobs, but it’s not exactly “movie star money.” $125,000 is more like what you might pay for a house in a small rural Wisconsin town, or about half, for example, of what Matthew Fox got paid to costar as Jack in one episode of LOST (and there were 121 of those).  (Plus Matthew Fox didn’t even have to show his ****, his *****, or even his ****.)  Dakota Johnson (TV’s Ben and Kate) is still attached to costar as Anastasia Steele, but the hunt is on for Hunnam’s replacement, with filming scheduled to start on November 1st.  The list of possibilities reportedly includes True Blood star Alexander Skarsgard and British actors Jamie Dorman (TV’s Once Upon a Time) and Christian Cooke (TV’s Magic City). Fifty Shades of Grey is scheduled to open up against Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy on August 1, 2014. We will probably hear very soon who will replace Charlie Hunnam.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 PAUL RUDD AND JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT ARE THE FRONTRUNNERS TO PLAY ANT-MAN\n\nOne of the big movie development news stories this week was the revelation that Paul Rudd and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are both now talking to Marvel Studios about starring as Ant-Man (scheduled for July 31, 2015). The interesting thing about those two actors being in the running is that they ostensibly have very little in common (their ages, their personas, their physicality, etc).  Curiously, most sources reporting this story haven’t picked up on a little hint that director Edgar Wright gave us years ago: You see, Wright said back at Comic-Con *seven years ago* that the movie will incorporate both Dr. Henry Pym (the first Ant-Man) and reformed thief Scott Lang (the second Ant-Man). So, that right there, might be the explanation. Paul Rudd might be up to play Hank Pym, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt might be up to play Scott Lang. The neat thing about this is that if both characters are indeed cast by A list stars, then in the future, we could have an Avengers movie with both Ant-Man and one of Henry Pym’s other alter egos (Giant Man, Goliath, Yellowjacket, etc).  We should hear more soon.\n\n\n\t\n#2 JOSH BROLIN IN TALKS TO STAR IN JURASSIC WORLD\n\nThe casting of another certain actor overshadowed the previous reports so much that it’s maybe easy to forget now that there was a time when it seemed like Josh Brolin might be starring as Batman. This week, we learned that Brolin is now in talks with Universal Pictures to star in their hotly anticipated 2015 dinosaur sequel Jurassic World. The Brolin news came as the capper on a week that saw three previous announcements (joining Bryce Dallas Howard, who has been cast for a while now). It all started with the news that 12-year-old Ty Simpkins (memorable from Iron Man 3) had been cast in a role, which clued us in that Jurassic World will return the franchise to being about dinosaurs scaring the pants off young children, as it rightly should be. The same story also mentioned that Jake Johnson (from TV’s The New Girl) might also be up for a role, which, if true, would reunite him with director Colin Trevorrow, who directed Johnson in Safety Not Guaranteed. That news was soon followed by another young actor, 18-year-old Nick Robinson (from the indie film The Kings of Summer), who will apparently play the older brother of Simpkins’ character. Filming is scheduled to begin in early 2014, and Universal Pictures has scheduled Jurassic World for June 12, 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#3 CHANNING TATUM AND MANY OTHERS LEND THEIR VOICES TO GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S BOOK OF LIFE\n\nA year from yesterday, on October 17, 2014, the CGI animated movie Book of Life will be released by 20th Century Fox, marking the first time that a major studio has released a “holiday movie” about the Mexican celebration “Dia de los Muertos” (AKA the day after Halloween with all those spooky skeletons). That release will mark the end of a long road for one of Guillermo del Toro’s dream projects, which he is producing. This week, we learned who will be providing the voices, and it’s quite a list.  The four leads will be voiced by Channing Tatum, Zoe Saldana, Diego Luna, and Christina Applegate. The supporting characters will be voiced by Ana de la Reguera (Eastbound and Down), Placido Domingo, Hector Elizondo, Gabriel Iglesias, Cheech Marin, Ricardo “El Mandril” Sanchez, and Machete himself, Danny Trejo.  Book of Life, which is also described as a Romeo and Juliet-type love story, will mark the feature film directorial debut of Jorge Gutierrez, also known as the creator of the animated TV series El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera.\n\n\n\t\n#4 KATE BECKINSALE TO INVESTIGATE A (FICTIONALIZED) FAMOUS CASE IN THE FACE OF AN ANGEL\n\nNow that Law &amp; Order is off the air, there’s a huge vacuum in the area of fictionalized dramas loosely (or not so loosely) “inspired” by real famous crime stories. Sure, there’s still TV shows that do that (like the not-yet-canceled Law &amp; Order: SVU), but it’s not the same.  Anyway, returning to the subject of movies, we present to you this next movie, The Face of an Angel, which will be an adaptation of a book by Italian journalist Barbie Latza Nadeau. The fictionalization part gets a little confusing when you consider that the title of Nadeau’s book is “Angel Face: The True Story of Student Killer Amanda Knox,” which just sort of puts out there how different Nadeau perceived the case than, say, the way it was depicted by American news networks. The Face of an Angel will be the latest film from prolific British director Michael Winterbottom, who in the past has directed movies like A Mighty Heart (about Daniel Pearl’s widow) and 24 Hour Party People (about the Manchester music scene in the 1980s). Kate Beckinsale will play a journalist investigating a case “like” Amanda Knox’s, and Daniel Bruhl (The Fifth Estate, Rush) will play a documentary filmmaker. The Amanda Knox-ish character will be played by relative newcomer Cara Delevingne (her film debut was as the Princess Sorokina in Anna Karenina). The Face of an Angel is a BBC Films production, and filming begins soon in Tuscany, Italy.\n\n\n\t\n#5 LES MISERABLES STARS RUSSELL CROWE AND AMANDA SEYFRIED REUNITE IN FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS\n\nTheir characters didn’t really have much to do with each other, but Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried were both in last year’s latest version of Les Miserables, making this a reunion project.  Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried will play two of the title characters in the family drama Fathers and Daughters. The film’s story will be split between two period settings. In 1980s New York, famous novelist Jake Davis (Crowe) struggles with mental illness (à la A Beautiful Mind?) while trying to raise his five year old daughter. In modern New York, that daughter is now 30 (Seyfried herself is currently 27), and she “battles the demons that stem from her troubled childhood.” What’s somewhat confusing about the title is that it’s plural, but there might be another father and another daughter (hers?) that we don’t know about yet.  Fathers and Daughters will be directed by Gabriele Muccino (Seven Pounds, The Pursuit of Happyness) from a script by newcomer screenwriter Brad Desch.\n\n\n\t\n#6 WILL FERRELL AND JOHN C. REILLY TO COSTAR A THIRD TIME IN DEVIL’S NIGHT\n\nWill Ferrell and John C. Reilly first costarred together in 2006 in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, leading up to Reilly being more prominently teamed with Ferrell in 2008’s Step Brothers. This week, we learned that the two comedy stars will make a third film together called Devil’s Night, named after the pre-Halloween night of destruction (AKA Hell Night) that plagues some cities each year. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly will play former childhood friends who were first brought together by Devil’s Night, and then driven apart by the annual tradition. Many years later, they have to reunite to deal with the latest generation of hellions bringing their neighborhood to the brink of destruction.   Devil’s Night got its start as a script by the screenwriting team of Andrew Mogel and Jarrad Paul, who also cowrote the 2008 Jim Carrey comedy Yes Man. There are a few reasons this could be listed as a Rotten Idea — namely the RT Tomatometer scores for Yes Man (45%) and Step Brothers (55%) — but we’re going to list this one as a borderline Fresh Development. Just because.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\n#3 HOT WHEELS MOVIE IS BACK ON TRACK (IF ONLY IN NAME ONLY)\n\nThe idea of a Hot Wheels movie has been in development since the early ’00s, when racing movies got hot again following the success of The Fast and the Furious. For a long while during its development at Warner Bros, Hot Wheels was expected to be an “eye candy” movie in which cars streak across the screen along tracks that soar into the sky, replicating the loops for which the toys are known. And then, the Wachowskis directed Speed Racer for the studio in 2008, and that movie’s flat box office seemed to change the Hot Wheels approach. At least, that’s what the speculation was, and this week’s news seemed to confirm it. Hot Wheels was one of the movies that Legendary Pictures took with it in the move to Universal Pictures, the home of the Fast and Furious franchise, and Universal seems eager to add to its roster of fast car franchises, as Hot Wheels has a director attached to it for the first time since McG was in talks back before Speed Racer. That director is one Simon Crane, whose work in the past has been as a second unit director on dozens of big movies (including Troy, Hancock, Salt, Men in Black 3, and World War Z), and also as stunt coordinator on many of those same films, plus Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. As noted above, the Hot Wheels script has gone through many versions over the years, and the latest draft is by Paul Attanasio, whose credits include Donnie Brasco, Sphere, The Sum of All Fears, and the upcoming remake of East of Eden. Attanasio’s take on Hot Wheels focuses on “a washed-up Illinois State Trooper who, after a dangerous military device falls into the hands of a criminal, fights the man his father once put behind bars.” Or, maybe the speculation is wrong, and that military device turns highways upside down. Hot Wheels is definitely a movie that could go either way, but we’re calling it a “Rotten Idea” that the movie sounds more like every other fast car movie, and less like a movie inspired by the retro fun of the actual Hot Wheels toys.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE ROCK TO STAR IN MOVIE ABOUT (QUAKING) ROCKS: SAN ANDREAS\n\nDwayne Johnson has signed a deal with New Line Cinema to star in their upcoming earthquake disaster movie called San Andreas. San Andreas will be a reunion film for Dwayne Johnson, as it will be directed by Brad Peyton, with whom Johnson worked on Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. Peyton also previously directed another sequel Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore. Johnson will be playing a “rugged” rescue helicopter pilot who travels across California following a devastating earthquake to save his estranged daughter (rather than, you know, actually doing his job for other people, apparently). Filming of San Andreas is scheduled to start in April of 2014 and the movie will be released sometime in 2015.\n\n\t\n#1 THE PHENOMENON THAT BEGAN WITH THE BIBLE CONTINUES AT THEATERS NEXT YEAR WITH SON OF GOD\n\nOne of the biggest events in television in 2013 was the History Channel mini-series The Bible, based upon the book of the same title. This week, we learned that one of the show’s most popular characters, Jesus Christ, will get His own big screen movie in 2014 called Son of God. Portuguese actor Diogo Morgado will reprise his role from the mini-series in the movie which 20th Century Fox will release in theaters nationwide on February 28, 2014. The Jesus episodes of the mini-series depicted his story from “his humble birth through his teachings, crucifixion and ultimate resurrection,” but this movie will focus more on “his humble birth through his teachings, crucifixion and ultimate resurrection.” This is largely to do with the fact that the movie that will be released as Son of God is in fact an edited 135 minute re-release of the Jesus episodes from The Bible (with some new scenes added in). Both The Bible and Son of God were produced by husband-wife team Mark Burnett (Survivor, The Voice) and Roma Downey (Touched by an Angel).  And yes, Mehdi Ouazzani will be in this version too. If you’re wondering why Son of God is the week’s most Rotten Idea, that question might be a good excuse to go check out RT’s still fairly new TV section, where The Bible received a Rotten score of just 14%.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Sony, Moore, Association, MTV, boxing, Black, Logo, History, werewolf, Emmy, DC","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Charlie-Hunnam-Drops-Out-of-Fifty-Shades-of-Grey"},{"id":"47509207963190","title":"Weekly Ketchup: J.J.

There’s also new roles for Tom Cruise and Will Smith.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nJ.J. ABRAMS AND LAWRENCE KASDAN CONFIRMED TO BE WRITING STAR WARS: EPISODE VII\n\nNormally, a screenwriter announcement would not be a week’s top story. But normally, movie news stories aren’t about Star Wars Episode VII. What we previously thought we knew about the Episode VII script was that it was being worked on by screenwriter Michael Arndt, whose filmography includes Toy Story 3 and Little Miss Sunshine. This week, Disney and Lucasfilm officially announced that director J.J. Abrams is also stepping in to work on the script with Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark, and cowrote The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Abrams has become a household name as director and producer of TV shows like LOST and Fringe, and movies like the two recent Star Trek films. However, Abrams’s career as screenwriter (which is more immediately relevant to this story) is mostly comprised of older, more obscure movies like Regarding Henry, Forever Young, Joy Ride, and Gone Fishin’.  So, if one truly wants to brush up on their Star Wars fan credentials, it looks like it’s time revisit wacky Joe Pesci buddy fishermen comedies (all one of them).  Have fun with that.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 DIRECTOR ROBERT ZEMECKIS TO ADAPT TOY SOLDIER DOCUMENTARY MARWENCOL\n\nThere are obviously bumpy spots in the filmography of Robert Zemeckis (they weren’t all Back to the Future, let’s just say), but to his credit, he’s always remained unpredictable.  And when those gambles pay off, we get movies like Contact, Cast Away and Beowulf.   Robert Zemeckis and Universal Pictures are teaming up to start development of a live action adaptation of the award-winning 2010 documentary Marwencol. That film told the story of Mark Hogancamp, who, following a brutal beating in 2000, constructed in his back yard a 1/6-scale toy soldier version of a Belgian town during World War II, populated by dolls representing himself, his family and friends, and the five men who attacked him. Zemeckis came to Universal Pictures with a screenplay already adapted by Caroline Thompson, whose past films include Edward Scissorhands, The Secret Garden, and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Since there’s already a screenplay, there’s speculation that Robert Zemeckis might actually be planning on making Marwencol his next film. Unlike many other directors of his class (who are attached to multiple films for years, many of which never get made), it’s happened a few times in the past (like with Flight) that Zemeckis has begun filming movies people barely knew were even in development, only to find said movies in theaters just a year later. If Marwencol is indeed that close to happening, we should start hearing casting news in the next couple of months.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE AVATAR SEQUEL TRILOGY FINDS ITS “DARTH VADER” AND IT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU…\n\nThis story may be surprising for anyone who saw Avatar (and if you haven’t yet, why are you reading this story?  It’s got spoilers!). Anyway, Avatar pretty much seemed to put the nails in the coffin, let’s say, for Stephen Lang’s antagonist character of Colonel Miles Quaritch, who was pierced repeatedly in the chest by the pointy ends of multiple N’avi arrows. Avatar is also, of course, a science fiction about people taking on alien forms using advanced technology, so maybe that leads us to the following news. Stephen Lang will be returning for the three Avatar sequels as what is being described as the “Darth Vader” of the franchise. James Cameron is deep in pre-production for the sequel trilogy, with filming not expected to start this time in October. 20th Century Fox is expected to release the first Avatar sequel sometime in December, 2016, with the third and fourth films following in the same month in 2017 ad 2018.\n\n\n\t\n#3 TIM BURTON! TIM BURTON! TIM BURTON! TO FINALLY DIRECT THE LONG AWAITED BEETLEJUICE SEQUEL\n\nThis year marked the 25th anniversary of the release of the 1988 supernatural comedy Beetlejuice, and it can feel to movie news writers like the last two decades have seen annual or bi-annual news stories about a Beetlejuice sequel happening… someday.  Sometimes, for these sort of things to turn around, certain types of events need to happen. For a studio like Warner Bros, the recent departure of prolific movie generator Legendary Pictures (to Universal) certainly could be seen as an impetus for revisiting long-lingering projects like Beetlejuice 2. And so, we can finally report that director Tim Burton is officially in talks with Warner Bros and The Geffen Company to direct a sequel to Beetlejuice.  Michael Keaton is also expected to reprise his performance as the title character. This development came after recent changes at 20th Century Fox concerning the adaptation of the book Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, which had been expected to be Tim Burton’s next film as director (after recently wrapping the biopic Big Eyes). There’s also speculation that Warner Bros was able to get Tim Burton to rethink Beetlejuice 2 at least partly as payback to the studio for the financial hit they took when Burton’s dream project Dark Shadows failed to do much for Warner Bros. There’s no word yet as to whether any other Beetlejuice costars (like Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, or Winona Ryder) might also return.\n\n\n\t\n#4 HELLRAISER TO BE RAISED FROM DEVELOPMENT HELL BY… NEARLY THE SAME PEOPLE?\n\nIt happens sometimes that a foreign film will be remade in English just a few years later by the film’s original director. It’s far less common for this to happen with films that are decades old, but British author-turned-director Clive Barker is not, in fact, a common filmmaker. And so, when Dimension Films starts filming of the long-in-development remake of the 1987 S&amp;M-influenced supernatural horror film Hellraiser, the movie will be directed by Clive Barker. In addition to making his directorial debut with that film, Clive Barker also wrote the original novella The Hellbound Heart that the movie adapted. Clive Barker won’t be alone in this revisit, however, as actor Doug Bradley will also be returning to Hellraiser in the remake, once again reprising his demonic character known as Pinhead. The world has changed a lot since 1987, and one would have to guess that the remake will reflect that. Back then, Hellraiser shocked audiences with its depictions of S&amp;M sex scenes, while next year, the world’s going to get a mom-friendly S&amp;M movie in Fifty Shades of Grey. There’s no production start date for the new Hellraiser yet. This one of the Fresh Developments because a) Clive Barker’s filmography is quite “Fresh,” and b) this is sort of an extreme example of how remakes of beloved genre classics should happen.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#5 ETHAN HAWKE RETEAMS WITH GATTACA DIRECTOR FOR A MOVIE ABOUT DRONES\n\nHollywood publicists are very much in the business of putting the best possible image on things (that is literally their job). And so, the headlines for stories in the Weekly Ketchup may sometimes seem to conflict with what we call “Rotten Ideas.” Take, for example, the news that Ethan Hawke is reuniting with director Andrew Niccol, with whom he made the 1997 sci-fi movie Gattaca. That movie has a “Fresh” rating of 82% on the RT Tomatometer, so what’s Rotten here? Well, it’s more understandable when we factor in the other four movies that Andrew Niccol has directed, only one of which in the last 15 years has been “Fresh” (Lord of War), versus three “Rotten” movies (S1m0ne, In Time, and this year’s The Host). Anyway, in the untitled thriller, Ethan Hawke will star as a fighter pilot who “becomes a Las Vegas-based drone pilot. He fights the Taliban by remote control for twelve hours a day, then goes home to the suburbs and feuds with his wife and kids for the other twelve. He starts to question his mission, and asking himself if he is creating more terrorists than he is killing in a war seemingly without end.” There’s a lot of meaty ripped-from-the-headlines material there, but mostly?  They lost this writer at “Ethan Hawke will star as a fighter pilot.”\n\n\n\t\n#4 THIS WEEK IN WILL SMITH: SELLING TIME, AND THE TWO DIFFERENT INDEPENDENCE DAY SEQUEL SCRIPTS\n\nPeople get dazzled by big box office numbers, but this column is concerned with very different numbers. Will Smith, for example, is one of the most successful movie stars of all time. His RT Tomatometer, however, tells a different story. Did you know, for example, that of all the movies Will Smith has been credited with appearing in since 2007’s I Am Legend, only one (Men in Black III) is “Fresh” on the Tomatometer. Well, maybe things will turn around for Mr. Smith who is attached to star in the 20th Century Fox supernatural thriller called Selling Time. Smith will play “a man who is given a chance to relive the worst day of his life in exchange for seven years off his life expectancy.” The script comes from newcomer Dan McDermott, who is a former DreamWorks Television president who one day apparently decided, “what I really want to do is write movies.” That’s the new movie project that got Will Smith into the news this week, but the story that most people heard about was the one about how Roland Emmerich is developing two different scripts for the Independence Day sequel, depending upon whether or not they can get Will Smith to sign on to star. That one is also from 20th Century Fox, and ID Forever Part I is currently scheduled for release on July 3, 2015, where it’s expected to do crazy numbers because what else will moviegoers have going on by the middle of summer, 2015?  Oh wait…\n\n\n\n#3 TOM CRUISE MIGHT GO LIKE HELL IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE BUSINESS\n\nWe sort of went to town on Will Smith’s filmography in that last story, so we’re going to let Tom Cruise sit this one out while discussing why it’s a “Rotten Idea.” First, the story itself: Tom Cruise is attached to produce, and possibly costar in the 20th Century Fox drama Go Like Hell, a movie which will examine the true stories surrounding the automobile industry in the early 1960s. The movie will be based on the book by A.J. Baime called Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans. Early reports mistakenly said Tom Cruise might play Henry Ford II, but the role he’s instead interested in is car engineer Carroll Shelby, who most people know as the guy behind the famous Shelby Mustang muscle cars. Nicolas Cage drove a Shelby Mustang in Gone in 60 Seconds, to pull out a hip, with-it reference from the early Oughts. So far, so good, right?  Well, the reason this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas is that the director Tom Cruise is looking to reteam with is one Joseph Kosinski, whose first two movies were TRON: Legacy and this year’s Oblivion, both of which earned “Rotten” scores in the low 50% range.  Of course, maybe science fiction just isn’t his thing, and Go Like Hell will be the movie to turn things around for Kosinski.\n\n\n\t\n#2 20TH CENTURY FOX TO DEVELOP TRILOGY OF MOVIES INSPIRED BY WEBSITES — CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE\n\nThe Weekly Ketchup has seen some pretty “out there” ideas and trends come and go. Often, the problem with the movies are that the things they are attempting to “adapt” are inherently non-narrative. File this story in that category: there is a movie studio that wants to develop an entire trilogy of movies based upon… websites. No, not the content on the websites, but just their names and the very loose premises. 20th Century Fox has acquired the film rights to the websites The Knot, The Bump, and The Nest, for a trilogy of comedies that follow an ensemble cast through three stages of life (marriage, pregancy, and parenthood). So, yes, we’re talking about three more movies that fall into that same “loosely thematic ensemble comedy” mix like Valentine’s Day and What to Expect When You’re Expecting. Of course, there may be a bright side to this story, if The Knot, and its two sequels are huge blockbuster successes (they probably won’t be, but roll with us here).  I’m imagining a real four-quadrant CGI comedy hit here.  It’ll be about a bunch of vegetables attending a movie marathon, who are challenged to finish all the movies before they’re too ripe to be harvested.  We’ll call it (wait for it)… Rotten Tomatoes! Or maybe if studios are in the mood for something more dramatic, there’s always the harrowing true story of the creator of Upcomingmovies.com, one of the world’s first “movie websites.” Say, whatever happened to that guy…\n\n\n\t\n#1 JAMIE DORNAN LANDS ROLE OF CHRISTIAN GREY IN FIFTY SHADES OF GREY\n\nLast week’s big news was that Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy, Pacific Rim) had dropped out of playing Christian Grey in next summer’s adaptation of the E.L. James novel Fifty Shades of Grey. Filming was scheduled to start on November 1, so it seemed likely that Hunnam’s replacement would be cast quickly, and sure enough, Universal Pictures and Focus Features have found their man. Again. This time around, it’s Northern Irish actor Jamie Dornan, who is known more for his TV work (as the Huntsman in ABC’s Once Upon a Time) than his movie work (his highest profile film was 2006’s Marie Antoinette, in which he had a small role). Dakota Johnson is still attached to star as Anastasia Steele, and the movie will be directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy). The other interesting news that came out this week (but was overlooked by most) is that Universal and Focus approached Juno Temple (The Dark Knight Rises) and Frank Grillo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) to play, respectively, Steele’s best friend and Grey’s bodyguard. “Both actors passed on the roles, according to sources.”\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"worst, HBO, aapi, 2020, of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-JJ-Abrams-and-Lawrence-Kasdan-to-Finish-Star-Wars-7-Script"},{"id":"47509209392710","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Is X-Force Fox’s New Franchise?","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Is X-Force Fox's New Franchise?\n                        Plus, new roles for Johnny Depp, Ben Affleck, and Kevin Costner, and Legendary Pictures leaves WB,\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 12, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis was another slow week in Hollywood movie development news for two reasons.  Many people are still on summer vacation the week after Independence Day, and we’re still before next week’s San Diego Comic Con, which is usually a huge “news dump” each year.  Marvel got several stories ahead of the pack (including news of an X-Force movie), and there are also new projects for Ben Affleck and Johnny Depp.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTHIS WEEK IN MARVEL MOVIES NEWS PART 1: X-FORCE TO BE NEXT FOR FOX’S MUTANT MOVIE SERIES?\n\nIt’s difficult to guage exactly why it felt like there was so much Marvel news this week.  Was it just another typical week (ie, there’s always tons of Marvel news nowadays), or was it because San Diego Comic Con is next week?  Anyway, there was enough that the several stories will be bundled together as just two headlines in the Weekly Ketchup, starting with what’s going on at 20th Century Fox.  To recap, the Marvel comic book adaptations these days are basically at three studios:  Sony has Spider-Man (and related characters like Venom), Fox has Fantastic Four and X-Men, and Marvel and Disney themselves have The Avengers and any other character not included within the rights of Fox or Sony.   The big Marvel news came out in drips and dribbles this week, but we might as well skip to the punchline which just came out this afternoon.  Kick-Ass 2 screenwriter and director Jeff Wadlow has been assigned by 20th Century Fox to start work on an X-Force script.  For the unfamiliar, an explanation of X-Force is definitely a good idea, except they’re not really that easy to explain.  Simply put, X-Force is a team that has existed in various forms since 1991, and they represent a more “extreme” approach to fighting threats to mutant peace and livelihood.  There have been three major versions of X-Force in the comics: 1) the original version that featured young mutant heroes led by Cable (who was from the future); 2) a satirical early 2000s version that was a commentary on reality TV and pop culture; and 3) the team since 2008 which is a “black ops” team that does the dirty work that the X-Men can’t (and shouldn’t).  The smart money would probably be on the X-Force movie being more like the modern comics, but with some of the characters from the 1990s like Cable, and maybe Deadpool.  Ryan Reynolds had some things to say this week about the still-in-the-works Deadpool movie. Finally, Hugh Jackman got quite a bit of news exposure this week for his comments about wishing that Fox, Sony and Marvel could come together and make deals that would allow all of the Marvel characters to be in the same movies together.  Not that it’s ever going to happen, but it’s nice to hear someone like Jackman say it.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 BEN AFFLECK TO STAR IN GONE GIRL FOR DIRECTOR DAVID FINCHER\n\nWhen Ben Affleck appeared recently in the trailer for Runner Runner (with Justin Timberlake), a natural reaction might have been, “Oh yeah, I guess he does still star in movies as well as direct.”  That’s just how positive the reaction has been to Ben Affleck’s films as director, the most recent being of course last year’s big Oscar winner Argo.  But yes, Affleck is still an actor too.  This week, he started negotiations with 20th Century Fox to star in the drama Gone Girl, which will be directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Zodiac).  Gone Girl will be an adaptation of a novel by Gillian Flynn about a man who is suspected of murder after the disappearance of his wife of five years.  The deal for Ben Affleck to appear in Gone Girl is being timed around Affleck’s next gig as director, which will be the adaptation of the novel Live by Night by Dennis Lehane, whose novel Gone Baby Gone was Affleck’s directorial debut.\n\n\n\t\n#2 LEGENDARY PICTURES LEAVES WARNER BROS FOR NBC-UNIVERSAL\n\nThis news story can perhaps read a bit like “inside baseball” because it seems like it’s mostly about business deals and such, but as much as it impacts what movies will get produced in the coming years, this might be one of the bigger recent stories (even if it lacks big stars or titles in the headline).  After a few weeks of negotiations, the Legendary Pictures production company has made a deal that moves it from Warner Bros to NBC-Universal.  It’s important to note that the deal is with NBC-Universal, and not just Universal Pictures, because the allure of all that is under the umbrella of NBC-Universal was reportedly quite important to the deal (theme park, TV and cable production and distribution, notably).   Legendary Pictures had a pretty great run at Warner Bros (which will continue until 2014), which included several movies with Christopher Nolan (including the Batman movies and Inception), Zack Snyder (including 300, Watchmen, and Man of Steel), and Todd Phillips (The Hangover trilogy).  This weekend also sees the release of Legendary and WB’s Pacific Rim, and their upcoming slate also includes The Seventh Son, 300: Rise of an Empire, the Godzilla reboot, and the Tom Cruise sci-fi action movie All You Need is Kill.  What is less clear is what projects Legendary Pictures will be bringing with them to Universal, and which ones will stay at Warner Bros.  The DC Comics adaptations will surely stay at Warner Bros, but one that might go with Legendary to Universal is the Warcraft video game adaptation to be directed by Duncan Jones (Moon).\n\n\n\t\n#3 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL NEWS PART 2:  VIN DIESEL, AGENT CARTER, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY\n\nFollowing up on something that made the news last month, Vin Diesel finally had that meeting with Marvel Studios.  And after, he posted on his Facebook an image of himself standing next to a poster of the classic comic book #2 of The Avengers.  The cover includes an arrow pointing at Giant-Man (AKA Ant-Man), but Vin Diesel also uses the word “vision” in his post.  So, we still don’t really know what the talks were about.  Could Vin Diesel star in the 2015 movie Ant-Man (probably the furthest stretch), join the Avengers as the android Vision, or play the villain Thanos (what’s always seemed most likely, given Diesel’s resemblance to Thanos)?   Speaking of Thanos, there was also a report online this week that purported to tell us all what villains will be played in Guardians of the Galaxy by Benicio Del Toro, Lee Pace, and Karen Gillan.  If it’s true, those three will be playing, respectively, the Collector, Ronan the Accuser, and Nebula.  Those three characters are either unrelated or related to various other cosmic Marvel characters depending upon which comics you’re reading (or as Iron Man 3 showed us, the movie might just be its own beast entirely).  And finally, this week, we got our first images of the next Marvel One Shot short film, Agent Carter, which will premiere next week at Comic Con in San Diego, and then appear on the Iron Man 3 Blu Ray.  Hayley Atwell will reprise her character from Captain America: The First Avenger, one year later, as she’s on the trail of “Zodiac” (which likewise, in the comics, has meant different things at different times).\n\n\n\t\n#4 KEVIN COSTNER TO STAR IN (ANOTHER) SPORTS MOVIE, MCFARLAND\n\nKevin Costner has made quite a career out of sports movies (American Flyers, Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, Tin Cup, For Love of the Game).  Now 58, Kevin Costner’s career in sports movies is continuing, but this time, he will play a coach in Disney’s drama McFarland.  Directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider, North Country), McFarland will tell the true story of a track and field team in a small mostly-Latino town in California in the 1980s that must overcome social and physical “hurdles.”  See what they (Variety, probably) did there?\n\n\t\n#5 JOHNNY DEPP VEERS SMALLER WITH THE CHARACTER COMEDY MORTDECAI\n\nBesides being pre-Comic-Con, this week was also notable for following the disappointing box office of The Lone Ranger.  Johnny Depp’s response appears to have been a decision to sign on for a smaller “character study” comedy called Mortedecai.  The project is a long-in-development adaptation of the comedic crime novel The Great Mortdecai Moustache Mystery by author Kyril Bonfiglioli. Mortdecai was previously in development at Warner Bros (where Johnny Depp was also attached to star in the project), and now it’s at Lionsgate.  Mortdecai will be directed by David Koepp, who previously worked with Depp on the Stephen King adaptation Secret Window.  Koepp’s other films as director include The Trigger Effect, Stir of Echoes, Ghost Town, and Premium Rush.\n\n\n\t\n#6 X-MEN WRITER DAVID HAYTER TO ADAPT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT COMIC BOOK THE SWORD\n\nThis story is a pretty great example of exactly how slow of a week this was.  It’s also a story that was probably announced this week to get ahead of Comic Con, because once that news cycle really kicks in, a project like The Sword would truly get completely buried.  Anyway, the gist is this:  Lakeshore Entertainment (Aeon Flux, Crank, Underworld) has hired screenwriter David Hayter to adapt the comic book title The Sword for a project which they hope will start filming in early 2014.  David Hayter is best known for two things:  as one of the writers of the first two X-Men movies, and (less relevantly here) for being the voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid games.  Anyway, The Sword is about a paraplegic young woman who discovers an ancient sword that allows her to walk, and perform amazing swordplay feats, allowing her to wreak vengeance on those responsible for the slaughter of her family.  Lakeshore Entertainment is hoping The Sword might be successful enough to lead to a franchise of at least four movies.\n\n\n\n#7 CHLOE MORETZ TO STAR IN TEEN COMA DRAMA IF I STAY\n\nAfter starring in the upcoming remake of Carrie for MGM, Chloe Moretz signed a deal recently to stick with the studio for another movie.  Chloe Moretz will star in If I Stay, as a teenage girl who has an out-of-body experience after a disastrous car accident, then tries to decide whether to continue what will be a difficult life or just give up on life altogether.  If I Stay will be directed by TV series producer R.J. Cutler, whose series include Flip That House, Greatest American Dog, and ABC’s Nashville.  If I Stay lands just on this side of “Fresh” because it’s a new Chloe Moretz movie, honestly.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 AFTER THE LONE RANGER, DISNEY NEXT TARGETS REMAKE OF THE JUNGLE BOOK\n\nAfter a big movie like The Lone Ranger lands with a thud both critically and commercially, it’s fairly common for a studio to next announce movie projects that can be seen as “corrections” and acknowledgements of what went wrong. That, at least, is one way to interpret the news this week that Walt Disney Pictures is developing a new live action remake of Rudyard Kipling’s short story anthology The Jungle Book.  Disney’s 1967 animated film The Jungle Book remains the most famous movie based on Kipling’s stories, but there were also live action adaptations in 1942 and 1994.  That more recent version was also from Disney, and was an early film from director Stephen Sommers, five years before his first major hit with The Mummy.  This second attempt by Disney at a live action The Jungle Book has competition in the form of another adaptation by Harry Potter screenwriter Steve Kloves (because the rights to The Jungle Book are now in the public domain).  As for why this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas? The screenwriter that Disney has hired for this project, Justin Marks, currently has one feature film to his credit:  2009’s Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.\n\n\n\t\n#1 TEXAS CHAINSAW 3D PRODUCERS TARGET ZOMBIES NEXT WITH DAY OF THE DEAD REMAKE\n\nIt was only six months ago, but it already feels like years since the January rerelease of Texas Chainsaw 3D.  Like many January releases, the movie came out in that dead zone between Oscar season and the better promoted movies of the spring season.  We’re right in the middle of summer blockbuster season now, so it might be difficult to imagine the reasoning, but times of the year like January can actually be fairly profitable for less ambitiously budgeted genre projects.  Anyway, the next horror remake for the producing team behind Texas Chainsaw 3D appears likely to be a remake of George A. Romero’s Day of the Dead. That 1985 release was the finishing film of Romero’s original zombie trilogy (before he returned to them starting with Land of the Dead in 2005).  Night of the Living Dead itself has been remade a few times now, and the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead was the movie that launched the directing career of Zack Snyder, who most recently gave us this summer’s Man of Steel. We don’t yet know how faithful the remake will be to Romero’s tale of soldiers and scientists hiding out in the days following a zombie apocalypse, but the producers do promise to stick with “slow” zombies rather than the more recently popular “fast” zombies… like those in, say, 2004’s Dawn of the Dead (or last month’s World War Z).  This is the week’s Most Rotten Idea based on the RT Tomatometer score for Texas Chainsaw 3D.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Marvel, elm, Geo, school, Election, Adventures, PBS, Shondaland, Pictures, TV, Toys, zombies, robots, DC, dramedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Is-XForce-Foxs-New-Franchise"},{"id":"47509209399880","title":"Weekly Ketchup: World War Z and This Is the End Getting Sequels?","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: World War Z and This Is the End Getting Sequels?\n                        \n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 28, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis Week’s Ketchup includes sequel news for Taken 3, the fifth Terminator, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1; movies based on Captain Planet, Encyclopedia Brown, and Knight Rider; and new roles for Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, and (maybe) Vin Diesel.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nSEQUELS POSSIBLE FOR APOCALYPTIC HITS WORLD WAR Z AND THIS IS THE END\n\nDestruction is a big thing this summer. Man of Steel is the most obvious, and where most of the press goes, but it’s not the only movie to score well at the box office in June with calamitous events, and it’s not the only such movie with sequel buzz either. After months of pre-release bad buzz about reshoots (and a six month release delay), World War Z opened this past weekend to $66 million in North America, and $111.8 million worldwide.  Paramount Pictures is claiming it as “the best opening for an original live-action tentpole since Avatar,” which is a bit weird because it was based on a bestselling novel.  Anyway, there’s been talk for a while of a possible World War Z trilogy, and those numbers were enough for Paramount and Brad Pitt’s Plan B to officially start development on a sequel.   All of this is arguably at least partly due to the surprisingly positive reviews for World War Z, and they were possibly due to the drastic changes to the film’s plot.  This link tells you about added scenes in the first hour of the film, and this detailed article describes the completely different third act.  It also explains why that one guy looked like Matthew Fox.  The quasi-reality-based apocalyptic comedy This is the End has also been quietly doing well (opening to over $20 million against Man of Steel), and Seth Rogen’s codirector Evan Goldberg is already talking up his idea for what a sequel could be like, which sounds like it veers crazily off into movie-within-a-movie territory.  Which is not to say that a sequel has actually been greenlit, of course (but it’s at least being talked about).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 DJANGO UNCHAINED STARS TO REUNITE FOR MEAN BUSINESS ON NORTH GANSON STREET\n\nAfter playing opposing roles in Django Unchained, Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio are now attached to costar in a new project for Warner Bros called Mean Business on North Ganson Street.  The movie will be an adaptation of an upcoming crime novel by S. Craig Zahler about two disgraced and/or demoted detectives who are reassigned to a crime-riddled town in Missouri.  The title of the movie bears some noting as Leonardo DiCaprio’s next movie is called The Wolf of Wall Street, with director Martin Scorsese, who himself had early success with Mean Streets, which is one letter off from being the first and second word of this movie.  When you add it all together, what you get is… yeah, it’s a complete coincidence.\n\n\n\t\n#2 JULIANNE MOORE MIGHT LEAD THE REBELLION IN THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY PART 1\n\nWe might still be almost five months away from the November 22, 2013 release of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, but that’s probably not really a reason for Lionsgate not to proceed with plans for the final two movies adapting The Hunger Games: Mockingjay (ie, few people are really expecting the audience for the first movie to stop showing up for the three sequels).  And so, we learned this week that negotiations have begun with Julianne Moore for her to play Alma Coin, who is an important figure in the growing rebellion against the evil President Donald Sutherland Coriolanus Snow.  If she signs, Moore will appear in both parts of Mockingjay, which are scheduled for release on November 21, 2014 and November 20, 2015, respectively.\n\n\n\t\n#3 VIN DIESEL HEADLINES THIS WEEK IN MARVEL NEWS… BUT WHY?\n\nThe biggest news this week involving Marvel Studios is that Vin Diesel revealed that he will be meeting soon with them. That, however, is basically where the story begins and ends.  Why does Marvel want to talk to Vin Diesel?  Is it for Thanos, the expected big bad in The Avengers 2, or perhaps for an entirely different superhero project?  At one point years ago, his name came up concerning a possible Sub-Mariner movie, but as far as we know right now, Marvel’s not actively pursuing that (though he could certainly appear in another character’s film).  This writer thinks it’s probably Thanos, but for the most shallow of reasons (Vin Diesel’s jawline sort of resembles the way Thanos is often drawn).   In a similarly mysterious vein, we also learned this week that Australian actor Josh Helman has been cast for several weeks of work on X-Men: Days of Future Past, but that’s again, about all we know.  He might be playing any one of dozens of Marvel’s mutants, or he might be playing “Sentinel Technician #2.”  You say you just absolutely love Marvel news stories with very few details to go on, and just two such stories aren’t enough?  Alright then: Also this week, Marvel announced another mystery movie for the release date of July 8, 2016.  What movie that might be, in between mystery movies on May 6, 2016 and May 5, 2017, is anyone’s guess.  And finally, here’s another release date which is only sort of Marvel-related.  Focus Features and Universal Pictures have announced a release date of August 1, 2014 for their adaptation of the “Mommie Porn” novel Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James.  And the reason that’s relevant here?  That’s the same release date as Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\n\n\t\n#4 WARNER BROS DEVELOPING LEGO SPINOFF NINJAGO\n\nThis past weekend saw the debut of the trailer for The LEGO Movie in theaters with Monsters University, preparing audiences for the film’s release on February 7, 2014.  Warner Bros is apparently happy with the big screen prospects for all things LEGO, as the studio has hired two of the writers of The LEGO Movie to work on an adaptation of the LEGO toy line Ninjago.  As you can guess from the title, the Ninjago line revolves around ninjas and other types of warriors and monsters inspired by both Japanese and Chinese mythology.  Ninjago was also the inspiration for the Cartoon Network animated series Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu which has aired on the network since January, 2011.  Warner Bros is reportedly close to finding a director for Ninjago, who will be someone other than Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the directors of The LEGO Movie, who also directed Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs.  With little more to base an opinion on, consider this Ninjago story a true borderline “???” this week.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#5 ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN AND THE CASE OF THE UNREQUESTED MOVIE DEVELOPMENT\n\nIt’s been an ongoing theme in Hollywood since the 1990s that studios love going to the material of their own childhood for material for movies for tomorrow’s kids.  Listing all of the examples would take too much space, but since this entry is mostly about Warner Bros, let’s use Yogi Bear and Where the Wild Things Are as examples (Garfield and The Smurfs are good examples at other studios).  The latest example of this strategy is Encyclopedia Brown, the 28 volume series of boy detective books by Donald J. Sobol which were first published in 1963 (until his death in 2012).  Warner Bros is now developing an Encyclopedia Brown movie, which is the latest effort in a franchise history of film attempts that goes back to the early 1980s and Chevy Chase.  This story comes just two weeks after a similar announcement at 20th Century Fox for plans for the Choose Your Own Adventure franchise.  Encyclopedia Brown is a borderline “Rotten Idea” just because as noted before, do kids today even know who he is?\n\n\n\t\n#4 LIVE ACTION CAPTAIN PLANET BACK IN DEVELOPMENT AGAIN\n\nMy, how time flies when you’re not really paying much attention.  As this writer prepared to report this week on the idea of a live action Captain Planet movie, it was with some surprise that I realized that it was actually almost two years ago now that we last reported on it.  Anyway, now it’s Sony Pictures that is picking up the rights to a movie based upon the early 1990s kids cartoon Captain Planet and the Planeteers about a blue skinned superhero with green hair who fights crime… as long as it’s environmental crime.  Let that contradiction sink in a bit.  Captain Planet was aided by five teenagers, four of whom wore rings representing the elements of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind, and the fifth was stuck with… Heart.   Don Cheadle has also starred in a series of Captain Planet short films for FunnyorDie.   Attempts at a live action Captain Planet movie date back to the 1990s.\n\n\n\n#3 PARAMOUNT ANNOUNCES NEW TERMINATOR TRILOGY (AND LEAVES SOMEONE OUT)\n\nIn advance, every upcoming year has lots of big movies tentatively scheduled, but 2015 is some sort of crazy special example. It might be easier to list franchises that don’t have entries planned for 2015 than those that do.  The list of possible/likely “big movies” for 2015 got even longer this week with the official announcement by Paramount Pictures of a June 26, 2015 release date for the next Terminator movie.  What’s especially curious about the news is that the film is being described as “the first in a stand-alone trilogy,” and nowhere in the announcement is there any mention of Arnold Schwarzenegger starring in this new film, which will be the fifth entry in the franchise (#4 was 2009’s Terminator: Salvation).  This movie, whatever it ends up being called, has made the news in recent weeks amidst talk of both Schwarzenegger and Dwayne Johnson appearing in it, but officially, Paramount Pictures isn’t mentioning any of that just yet.  The 33% Rotten score on the RT Tomatometer for Terminator: Salvation is why this new movie is still a “Rotten Idea” until we hear reasons to think otherwise.\n\n\n\t\n#2 LIAM NEESON TO RECEIVE NEARLY THE BUDGET OF TAKEN TO STAR IN TAKEN 3\n\nThis story is mostly about math and the Taken franchise, but let’s start with the math.  In 2008, Liam Neeson starred in a little movie called Taken, which had a reported budget of $25 million.  The movie ended up bringing in over $226 million internationally, so yeah, to little surprise, there was a Taken 2. That movie was released in October, 2012, and for his particular set of skills, Liam Neeson earned $15 million of the film’s $45 million budget that time around. The investment paid off even better for the sequel, which now has an international total of over $376 million.  And so, once again, to little surprise, there will be a Taken 3.  And that finally brings us to this week’s actual news, which is that Liam Neeson’s deal this time is in the $20 million range, or in other words, a number close to the entire budget for the first movie.  Deals will now be sought for Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace, who play his wife and daughter, respectively.  As for why this is one of the week’s most Rotten Ideas, here’s one last bit of math for you: 21% on the RT Tomatometer for Taken 2.\n\n\n\t\n#1 KNIGHT RIDER: THE MOVIE FROM THE WRITER OF… WILD HOGS?\n\nNot every movie based upon an old TV show is inherently a bad idea. We’ve actually gotten several pretty great movies from old TV shows (The Fugitive, The Untouchables, and the Mission: Impossible franchise, for some examples). Any movie needs the right parts, and in the case of this week’s Most Rotten Idea, the part that really makes it rotten involves the 2007 “comedy” Wild Hogs, which has a Tomatometer score of just 14%.  Screenwriter Brad Copeland wrote that movie, and now he’s been hired by the Weinstein Co. to work on their adaptation of the hit 1980s TV science fiction-tinged adventure show Knight Rider.   The motivation behind a Knight Rider movie seems mostly to be based on the success of the Fast and the Furious franchise, but those cars also don’t talk, or require someone to write lines for them to deliver.  And that brings us back to Wild Hogs.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"foreign, Comic, movies, winner, dragons, PBS, Paramount, Animation, thriller, Nickelodeon, and, Hulu, media, cops, Red","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-World-War-Z-and-This-Is-the-End-Getting-Sequels"},{"id":"47509210868303","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise Returns For Another Mission: Impossible","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise Returns For Another Mission: Impossible\n                        Plus, new films for Michael Shannon, Martin Scorsese, and Owen Wilson, and a Dungeons &amp; Dragons reboot.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 10, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup covers movie development news stories that include new entries in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Hot Tub Time Machine, and Mission: Impossible franchises, as well as the next movies from such acclaimed directors as Paul Thomas Anderson and Martin Scorsese.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTOM CRUISE WILL RETURN AS ETHAN HUNT FOR A FIFTH MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE\n\nIt may be difficult to remember this now, but there was a time a few years ago when people in Hollywood were wondering if Tom Cruise was a falling star, so to speak.  This was the time before the release of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, back when there was talk of Cruise handling the franchise over to Jeremy Renner… permanently.  Two years later, with a few more successes under his belt again, and no one’s talking like that anymore.  And so, Paramount Pictures made a big announcement this week that Tom Cruise will be producing, and again starring in a fifth Mission: Impossible movie.  Writer and director announcements are expected to follow later this year.  One of the people that might be a contender in both categories is Christopher McQuarrie, a frequent Cruise collaborator whose second film as director was last year’s Jack Reacher (he also cowrote Valkyrie, and the upcoming Cruise sci-fi war movie All You Need is Kill).  McQuarrie also made the news this week for signing a deal with Warner Bros to write and direct a remake of the 1968 Cold War thriller Ice Station Zebra, which was itself an adaptation of a novel by Alistair MacLean.  The politics may need an update, but the basic premise is about a U.S. submarine crew that is sent to the Arctic under the pretense of a rescue (but it’s really a top secret espionage type mission).  Tom Cruise hasn’t been mentioned specifically for the Ice Station Zebra remake, but yeah, they probably totally want him.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 SILENCE MAN, SILENCE MAN, DOES WHATEVER SCORSESE WANTS, IN JAPAN\n\nAfter some twenty years of development and various snags, director Martin Scorsese finally has a budget, a start date, and a star for his suspense film adaptation of the Shusaku Endo novel Silence.  Andrew Garfield, best known for his roles in The Amazing Spider-Man and The Social Network, has landed the role of Father Rodrigues, a 17th century Portuguese Jesuit priest who travels with another priest to Japan to investigate claims of religious persecution (against Catholics).  The role of the older priest is still up for grabs.  Earlier in the development of Silence, the actors that have been mentioned for possible lead roles included Daniel Day-Lewis, Gael Garcia Bernal, and Benicio del Toro (and it’s still possible one of those actors may yet land the other role).  Ken Watanabe (Batman Begins, The Last Samurai) has also been cast as the priests’ interpreter.  Location scouting in Japan is underway on the production which will start filming in the summer of 2014.  Silence will feature a largely Japanese cast, and much of the dialogue will be in Japanese.\n\n\n\t\n#2 MICHAEL SHANNON CHASES THE DIRECTOR OF MUD INTO BIG STUDIO TERRITORY\n\nSometimes, things just come together at the right time.  In this story, we concern ourselves with two movies that might otherwise seem unrelated.  Michael Shannon is costarring in next month’s Superman movie Man of Steel as General Zod, which is, of course, being released by Warner Bros.  Meanwhile, off in indie land, there was the recent, very well received release of Mud, the third film from director Jeff Nichols.  The connection between the two is that Michael Shannon starred in Nichols’ first two films Shotgun Stories and Take Shelter, and had a supporting role in Mud.   Now that all the building blocks have been explained, we get to the actual story this week, which is that director Jeff Nichols will be making his studio debut at Warner Bros with a currently untitled science fiction chase movie (set in the present day).  And, to make their collaborative streak four for four, Michael Shannon will star in the movie.\n\n\n\t\n#3 OWEN WILSON JOINS PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON’S TRIPPY PERIOD PIECE INHERENT VICE\n\nJoaquin Phoenix has been attached for a while to star in director Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel Inherent Vice.  It was this week, however, that the casting of the other roles really started to take off, with three fairly major stars now being mentioned.  It all started with news of Benicio Del Toro being in talks to play an attorney friend of Joaquin Phoenix’s character, a pot-smoking detective who in the spring of 1970 investigates the case of a missing/kidnapped girl.  This was followed by reports that both Owen Wilson and Charlize Theron are also in negotiations for what are being described as “lead roles,” with no other details.  Warner Bros is financing and distributing Inherent Vice, which is a return to the parent studio of some of Anderson’s earlier movies (specifically, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, which were distributed by New Line Cinema).\n\n\n\t\n#4 ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER WEEK OF MARVEL MOVIE MADNESS\n\nMaybe it’s just because Iron Man 3 made a ridiculous amount of money last weekend, but this was another week with multiple news stories concerning Marvel movies.  The biggest of these stories, if not particularly surprising, is that Robert Downey, Jr. has started negotiations for his returns as Tony Stark in the The Avengers 2 and The Avengers 3 (the titles of which will likely change).  What’s not currently in the mix is a fourth Iron Man movie (which if there ever is one, might feature a new actor in the role).  Buried in that story are two more revelations that really should have had their own headlines, which is that Marvel now has scripts in development for a Ms. Marvel solo movie, and a revival of the Blade franchise.  Sort of in the same category is the very brief (and buried) revelation this week from Marvel boss Kevin Feige that there are currently no plans for solo movies for War Machine (from the Iron Man solo movies) or the Falcon (from the upcoming Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Shane Black, who cowrote and directed Iron Man 3, also made a big deal this week, signing with Sony Pictures for his long-planned revival of the pulp hero Doc Savage.  Right here is where fans unpleased with certain story elements of Iron Man 3 can make their obligatory jokes about changes to Doc Savage (or especially his villains).  Back in the 1970s, there were technically Marvel Comics featuring the character of Doc Savage, but as a licensed character only, so that today, Marvel does not own the movie rights.  The other big Marvel story this week that many fans were talking about was the announcement by Walt Disney Pictures that the first animated movie from the studio based on a Marvel Comics property will be Big Hero 6, to be released on November 7, 2014.  What got lost in the mix a little bit, however, is that this wasn’t really that big of a news story, since almost everything we currently know about the Big Hero 6 movie was already written up in this column back in June of 2012 as a Fresh Development #2.\n\n\n\t\n#5 ROBERT DE NIRO TO INVESTIGATE CRIME TRAFFIC IN CANDY STORE\n\nRobert De Niro has joined two of today’s rising stars in the Brooklyn criminal underworld drama Candy Store.  Jason Clarke (Zero Dark Thirty, Guardians of the Galaxy) will play a former “covert ops agent” who discovers that an evil organization has set up shop in his neighborhood, and Robert De Niro will play a former cop who he teams up.  Omar Sy from the French comedy hit The Intouchables is also costarring.  Candy Store was cowritten by, and will be directed by, Stephen Gaghan, who also wrote Traffic, and wrote and directed Syriana.\n\n\t\n#6 PARKS AND RECREATION STAR ADAM SCOTT (SORT OF) REPLACES JOHN CUSACK IN HOT TUB TIME MACHINE 2\n\nGiven that the first movie was all about nostalgia for the 1980s, it was always sort of a presumed “given” that the eventual sequel might do the same thing for the 1990s.  This week’s casting news doesn’t come right out and confirm it, but it sort of gives that collective guess some additional weight.  Adam Scott, best known for his role in NBC’s Parks and Recreation, is in talks with MGM for the lead role (as a new character) in the sequel Hot Tub Time Machine 2.  Scott was born in 1973, which sort of makes him perfect to play someone who was a young man during the Bill Clinton years.  Three of the stars from the first movie will also be returning (Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry, and Clark Duke), but John Cusack will not be.  Steve Pink, who directed the first movie, will also be directing Hot Tub Time Machine 2.\n\n\n\n#7 REESE WITHERSPOON TO REUNITE WITH HER WALK THE LINE DIRECTOR FOR THREE LITTLE WORDS\n\nOne way, we’ve learned recently, for a movie star to deal with an embarrassing incident is to make a few casting announcements.  Reese Witherspoon made the Ketchup last week for the movie Passengers, where she will play a woman awakened on a decades-long space voyage by a sad Keanu Reeves.  That story was last week’s “Rotten Idea of the Week,” but this one makes the cut as a (borderline) “Fresh Development” based on other factors. Reese Witherspoon will reunite with director James Mangold (Walk the Line, The Wolverine) for an adaptation of the memoir Three Little Words by Ashley Rhodes-Courter.  Witherspoon will play a volunteer who helps a young girl in Florida reunite with her biological mother, possibly to be played by Amanda Seyfried (in negotiations).  The script has been worked on by Lewis Colick (Ghosts of Mississippi; cowriter of Charlie St. Cloud) and Michael Petroni (The Rite).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 THE LONG WAIT FOR JURASSIC PARK IV… JUST GOT A LITTLE LONGER\n\nSince the 2001 release of Jurassic Park III, one of the most demanded sequels by fans* has been a fourth Jurassic Park (*my old site used to track interest via traffic to preview pages, and Jurassic Park IV was almost always in the top 5).  Those dinosaur enthusiasts seemed to finally be getting what they wanted when Universal Pictures announced plans for Jurassic Park IV to be released on June 13, 2014.  The movie is still in development, but the wait just got a little bit longer this week.  After a few tweets that suggested bad news for the sequel, Universal made an official announcement: “In coordination with filmmakers, Universal has decided to release Jurassic Park 4 at a later date giving the studio and filmmakers adequate time to bring audiences the best possible version of the fourth installment in Universal’s beloved franchise.  We could not be more excited about the vision that Colin Trevorrow has created for this film, and we look forward to watching as he and the producers create another great chapter in this franchise’s storied history.”  Colin Trevorrow previously directed Safety Not Guaranteed.  We also learned this week that two of the actors who had met with Universal about roles in the sequel were Bryce Dallas Howard (The Village) and David Oyelowo (Rise of the Planet of the Apes).   We’re calling this one “Rotten” just because it sucks for fans to have to wait longer, but if the wait proves to have been the right decision, then, yeah, obviously, it should be considered “Fresh.”\n\n\n\t\n#1 WARNER BROS GETS TO ROLL A MULLIGAN ON THE DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS MOVIE FRANCHISE\n\nBack in 2000, Warner Bros attempted to start a new fantasy franchise on the big screen with Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a movie based on the classic pen-and-paper role playing game, which proved to be a critical and box office flop.  It should be remembered that this was before the releases of both the Lord of the Rings movies and the Harry Potter films (both also released by Warner Bros or its cousin New Line Cinema).  The argument could be made that the first Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie is to modern fantasy what any given pre-Blade superhero movie is compared to The Avengers or The Dark Knight.  People just approached these properties differently back then (with less respect, the argument can be made).   The 2005 direct-to-video sequel Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God was (in the opinion of this writer) better made, and a more faithful adaptation of the game, but the previous damage to the brand was already done.  It wasn’t necessarily permanent, however.  And so, Warner Bros announced this week plans for another big screen Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie, with a script based upon the Gary Gygax game Chainmail (that was the precursor to Dungeons &amp; Dragons).  That script was written by David Leslie Johnson, whose previous films include Orphan, Red Riding Hood, and cowriting duties on the fantasy sequel Wrath of the Titans.  This new Dungeons &amp; Dragons project joins Warner Bros’ other adaptation of a popular fantasy gaming franchise: World of Warcraft.  Finally, it’s worth mentioning that Hasbro, parent company of Wizards of the Coast, is already disputing whether Warner Bros currently has the rights to a Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie.  And where do those rights partly come from?  Courtney Solomon, the director of that first movie.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Freeform, live, Podcast, war, binge, Mystery, Crackle, Sundance, romantic, period, Golden, aliens, Cartoon","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Tom-Cruise-Returns-For-Another-Mission-Impossible"},{"id":"47509210880599","title":"Weekly Ketchup: The Veronica Mars Movie Kickstarter Campaign Succeeds","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: The Veronica Mars Movie Kickstarter Campaign Succeeds\n                        Christian Bale and Melissa McCarthy get roles, Trainspotting and Jurassic Park sequels are in motion.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 15, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes movie development news stories involving sequels for Horrible Bosses, Trainspotting and the Jurassic Park franchise, as well as new (or possible new) roles for Christian Bale and Melissa McCarthy.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTHE KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN FOR THE VERONICA MARS MOVIE MAKES HISTORY\n\nThe idea of the Veronica Mars movie being the top story of any given week might have seemed incredulous (and heck, maybe it still does).  The reason that this movie, based upon the 2004-2007 Kristen Bell series, earned the top spot has more to do with its history-making distinction, and more generally, what precedent this story might set, going forward.   It was this week that Warner Bros. and Veronica Mars producer Rob Thomas started a Kickstarter campaign for the funding of a Veronica Mars movie that raised its $2 million goal within 11 hours.  Initially, it was thought that WB Digital Distribution was going to fund the remainder of the budget, but with almost a month left to go in the campaign, the movie’s entire budget will now come from the Kickstarter donations. The people who ponied up the cash will receive a variety of escalating goodies for their contributions, the breakdown of which you can read about here.   The ramifications of this story have been quick and much discussed, particularly among fans of various other TV shows who would also like to see the objects of their obsessions get Internet-funded movies.  One producer who was quick to quell such speculation was Joss Whedon, who said he has no plans to turn to Kickstarter for a new Firefly/Serenity movie.  One problem keeping many such shows from getting the Kickstarter treatment is that, unlike Veronica Mars, many of these cancelled shows (your Pushing Daisies, your Moonlights) require more special effects and larger budgets.   Veronica Mars, on the other hand, is basically just about a young reporter who does a lot of talking.  And talk, as the saying goes, is cheap.  Technicolor fields of CGI flowers and reanimated corpses, not so much.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 ONE OF THE SIGNS LEADING INTO JURASSIC PARK IV READS SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED\n\nLast year, one of the directors to make the Star Wars Episode VII news (the job that eventually went to J.J. Abrams) was Colin Trevorrow, who made his debut with the indie Safety Not Guaranteed.  Eventually, we learned that the genre reboot that Treverrow was actually hinting at was the much lower profile Flight of the Navigator.  This week, Colin Trevorrow really did sign on to direct a high profile genre entry with Roman numerals in the title: Jurassic Park IV.  Universal Pictures has slated Jurassic Park IV for a release date of June 13, 2014, and Treverrow will be working from a script by Rise of the Planet of the Apes cowriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver.\n\n\n\t\n#2 WILL THE GOOD TIMES MOVIE BE DY-NO-MITE?\n\nThere was a time in Hollywood when “TV show adaptations” were one of the hot trends, and nearly every week brought word of a new such project.  Nowadays, not so much.  So, it’s almost refreshing to hear that Sony Pictures and producer Scott Rudin have started development on a movie based upon the 1974-1979 CBS sitcom Good Times.  That show is most remembered now for featuring J.J. Walker and a pre-pop-singer TV career for Janet Jackson.  In its own time, Good Times was one of a few hit shows for TV producer Norman Lear, who specialized in “social commentary” shows like All in the Family and Maude.   Specifically, the title of Good Times was sort of intended to be ironic, as the show was about a working class African American family in Chicago whose struggles suggested they weren’t really having such great times.  Producer Scott Rudin’s other adaptations in the past have included Shaft, Sabrina, and The Manchurian Candidate.\n\n\n\t\n#3 DISNEY’S FANTASY REBOOTS CONTINUE WITH THE BEAST\n\nFollowing the massive box office takes for Alice in the Wonderland and most recently Oz the Great and Powerful, it’s not terribly surprising that Walt Disney Pictures continues to put fantasy reboots into development.  This week’s newest entry in that growing line of projects is called The Beast, and it’s a reinvention of Beauty and the Beast.  For this assignment, Disney has hired screenwriter Joe Ahearne, who recently worked with director Danny Boyle on the upcoming film Trance. The Beast is almost certainly a few years away from being produced, but it joins a burgeoning development line that includes the Sleeping Beauty reboot Maleficent, and the new Cinderella (which we also learned this week will not be featuring Emma Watson, as was recently reported).\n\n\t\n#4 DANNY BOYLE HOPES TO REUNITE TRAINSPOTTING CAST IN 2016 FOR A SEQUEL\n\nIn Austin this week for the SXSW Film Festival (to promote Trance), director Danny Boyle revealed that he hopes to get the cast of Trainspotting (including Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, and Jonny Lee Miller) back together in 2016 for a sequel.  Screenwriter John Hodge is currently working on the script, which is only loosely based upon author Irvine Welsh’s actual sequel called Porno.   One reason that 2016 is the target for the sequel is that it will mark the 20th anniversary of the release of Trainspotting.  One has to imagine that Begbie, Spud, and Sick Boy are probably still cross at Rent Boy.\n\n\n\t\n#5 HOLLYWOOD’S BIG MOSES PLANS: EXODUS VERSUS GODS AND KINGS\n\nWe’re all still waiting on the two “White House attack” movies, but Hollywood is already onto its next pair of dueling movies, as two different studios are racing against each other to produce movies about the Biblical figure of Moses. And this week, both projects got fairly major news developments.  First up, there is the Warner Bros project Gods and Kings, which Steven Spielberg has now officially dropped out of considering.  In Spielberg’s place might be Ang Lee, who recently joined Spielberg as a two-time Best Director Oscar winner (for Life of Pi).  There’s no deal yet for Ang Lee, it’s worth noting, but in situations like this where studios are racing against each other, sometimes just the idea of a deal is enough to make the news.  In this case, the competition is at 20th Century Fox, where a Moses project called Exodus might just be director Ridley Scott’s next film after The Counselor.  An advantage that Exodus might have is that it already has an A list actor interested, in the form of Christian Bale.  However, just like with Ang Lee, there’s no deal in place yet for Bale either.\n\n\n\t\n#6 WWE WRESTLER DAVE BAUTISTA LANDS GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY ROLE AS DRAX THE DESTROYER\n\nFollowing a casting call that saw Jason Momoa (Game of Thrones) get most of the press, WWE wrestler Dave Bautista has landed the second role in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy as Drax the Destroyer.  Drax’s story stretches back to the 1970s and is correspondingly sort of convoluted, but for the purposes of this movie, let’s just say that he’s a human who is resurrected as a big green muscle bound warrior type (but not that *other* Marvel green-skinned muscle bound guy). Bautista joins the previously cast Chris Pratt (as Star-Lord), which now leaves just one more actor to be cast (Gamora), and two more voice roles (Groot and Rocket Raccoon), to fill out the five main members of the team.\n\n\n#7 HORRIBLE BOSSES TRIO RETEAMS FOR BOTH THE SEQUEL AND ONE NIGHT ON THE HUDSON\n\nThe ramifications of the July, 2011 box office success of Horrible Bosses continued to be felt this week, a year and a half later.   Most obviously, deals were made and in the process of being made for director Seth Gordon and cast members Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, and Jamie Foxx to reunite for Horrible Bosses 2, along with director Seth Gordon.  Three of them (Bateman, Day and Gordon) also are in talks with Universal Pictures to team up for a completely different project called One Night on the Hudson, about a pair of cops who are tasked with escorting a federal witness from New Jersey to Manhattan.  Horrible Bosses 2, which is expected to start filming in the late summer of 2013, is expected to happen first.\n\n\t\n#8 MELISSA MCCARTHY LANDS DRAMATIC ROLE IN WEINSTEIN COMPANY OSCAR BAIT ST. VINCENT DE VAN NUYS\n\nLike so many before her, Melissa McCarthy appears ready to make the transition from comedic to dramatic actress in the Weinstein Company project St. Vincent De Van Nuys.  McCarthy has landed what is being described as a much sought role as a struggling single mother whose 12 year old son is taken care of by a “train wreck” of a neighbor to be played by Bill Murray.  St. Vincent De Van Nuys got its start as an entry on the “Black List of Unproduced Screenplays,” and it will also mark the directorial debut of its screenwriter Ted Melfi.   Filming is expected to start in July while Melissa McCarthy is on hiatus from her CBS sitcom Mike &amp; Molly.\n\n\t\n#9 ROBERT DUVALL AND VINCENT D’ONOFRIO TO PLAY ROBERT DOWNEY JR’S FAMILY IN THE JUDGE\n\nWe’ve known for a while that Robert Downey Jr. was going to star in the Warner Bros dramedy The Judge, but this week was when we finally learned who will play the title character.  Robert Duvall will play Downey’s father, a small town judge who is the main suspect in the murder case of the mother of Downey’s character, who’s a successful attorney himself.   Vincent D’Onofrio (Law and Order: Criminal Intent) has also been cast as Downey’s older brother.  The Judge will be directed by David Dobkin (Fred Claus, The Change Up), whose last three films have all earned “Rotten” scores on the RT Tomatometer, which is why The Judge is the lowest rated of this week’s stories.  However, Downey, Duvall and D’Onofrio — in addition to sharing final initials — are all fine actors, which just barely saved The Judge from being the week’s sole Rotten Idea.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\nNo single movie story seemed “Rotten” enough for this category this week.  Huzzah!  We all got a week off from horrible movie studio ideas.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Signature, language, Adult, dceu, Peek, Geographic, 20th, Mary, Now, deadpool, jurassic, competition, Rocky, versus","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-The-Veronica-Mars-Movie-Kickstarter-Campaign-Succeeds"},{"id":"47509210876500","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Third G.I.

JOE TO GET A THIRD MOVIE, WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR TOY MOVIES (AND PROBABLY BAD NEWS FOR EVERYONE ELSE)\n\nJust when it seemed like maybe the drive in Hollywood to produce a new wave of movies based on toys might have been prevented, G.I. Joe: Retaliation had a huge weekend, and it looks like those plans are probably right back on again.  Retaliation opened to $132 million globally, and enough domestically to make it the second best Easter weekend opening ever.  And so, Paramount has unsurprisingly started development on a third G.I. Joe movie.  The spin that we can eventually expect from the studio or the involved producers is that this was all part of a plan for a G.I. Joe trilogy, but the lack of such talk when people expected G.I. Joe: Retaliation to be a huge bomb (like when it was bumped back from June, 2012) might suggest otherwise.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 TWELVE YEARS LATER, FINDING NEMO GETS A SEQUEL IN FINDING DORY\n\nPixar Films and Walt Disney Pictures have officially announced that the Finding Nemo sequel will be called ( http://collider.com/finding-nemo-2-finding-dory-release-date/ ) Finding Dory, and will be released on November 25, 2015, over twelve years after the release of the original film (oh how, tempus fugit).  Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres (as the title character) are both confirmed to return in this new CGI animated adventure which is set one year after the events of the first film, which effectively makes it a period piece (though it’s unlikely we’ll be getting much circa-2004-nostalgia).  Finding Dory will also be director Andrew Stanton’s next film after the experiment with live action that the world more commonly knows as last year’s John Carter.\n\n\n\t\n#2 ZOE SALDANA’S FRANCHISE COLLECTION EXPANDS WITH GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY\n\nIt’s more common with elderly British actors (like Sirs Christopher Lee and Ian McKellen), but Zoe Saldana is another actor that is starting to pile up appearances in genre franchises that would be really handy if people still played Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.  It all started with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and continued with major roles in Avatar and Star Trek. Now, Saldana is expanding her franchise domination by engaging in talks with Marvel Studios to play the green-skinned alien assassin Gamora in Guardians of the Galaxy.  With Chris Pratt and Dave Bautista already cast as Star-Lord and Drax the Destroyer, the only remaining team members left to be announced are Rocket Raccoon and Groot, both of whom are likely to be mostly voice cast (since they are, respectively, a genetically manipulated animal and a talking tree).  There was also an online story that (if true) lets us know that one of the villains in Guardians of the Galaxy might be frequent Iron Man enemy The Controller, acting as an agent of Thanos (who’s expected to be the main villain of The Avengers 2).  Finally, ComingSoon.net scored this week a photo gallery of over a dozen concept art images from Marvel’s Phase 2 films, which includes our first glimpses at Falcon and the Winter Soldier from Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and a pretty good look at what Rocket Raccoon might look like.\n\n\n\t\n#3 TIM BURTON RETEAMS WITH THE WRITERS OF ED WOOD FOR THE BIOPIC BIG EYES\n\nTim Burton has been making “big movies” for so long that it might be easy to forget that little biopic he directed back in 1994 about the life of filmmaker Ed Wood.  Just in time for that movie’s 20th anniversary next year, Tim Burton has signed with The Weinstein Company to direct another biopic written by Ed Wood cowriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.  The movie in question is called Big Eyes, which will tell the true story of Margaret and Walter Keane, the married couple responsible for a distinct type of kitschy paintings easily recognized for the size of the eyes of the subjects.  The couple’s story includes the twist that it was Walter Keane who took the credit at the time for the paintings, despite his wife Margaret being the one that actually painted them (sometimes locked in a room until she finished). Big Eyes has been in development for a while now, with the two roles previously being discussed as going first to Kate Hudson and Thomas Haden Church, and then to Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Reynolds. Well, if all negotiations go well, the final pairing will instead be Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz.  Filming of Big Eyes will start this summer, after which, Tim Burton will probably move onto making a movie with Johnny Depp.\n\n\n\t\n#4 JESSICA CHASTAIN AND BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH JOIN GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S GHOST STORY CRIMSON PEAK\n\nThis week, Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek Into Darkness) joined already announced cast members Emma Stone (Easy A) and Charlie Hunnam (Pacific Rim) as the stars of Guillermo Del Toro’s next film, Crimson Peak.  Although specifics aren’t yet known, Crimson Peak is described as a ghost story set during the turn of the 20th Century (from the 19th) which plays around a bit with some of the conventions of the subgenre.  Filming is expected to start on Crimson Peak in January, 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#5 CHLOE MORETZ AND NICHOLAS HOULT JOIN CHARLIZE THERON FOR DARK PLACES\n\nDark Places is the title of an adaptation of a mystery novel by Gillian Flynn about a woman who has to revisit the massacre of her family 20 years later when a group called the Kill Club questions whether the right person was convicted for the murders. Charlize Theron has already been cast as the main character (replacing the previously reported Amy Adams).  This week, &lt;Chloe Moretz (Kick-Ass) and Nicholas Hoult (Warm Bodies, About a Boy) were also cast as members of the Kill Club. Dark Places was adapted and will be directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner (2011’s Sarah’s Key).\n\n\t\n#6 WILLIAM H. MACY ATTRACTS AN ALL-STAR CAST FOR HIS DIRECTORIAL DEBUT RUDDERLESS\n\nActor William H. Macy will be making his directorial debut with a musical drama called Rudderless about a father who forms a band to perform the original music that he discovers was written by his dead son (in other words, the feel good movie of 2014). In addition to starring with his wife Felicity Huffman, Macy has recruited several established actors to join him in the cast. That list will include Billy Crudup, Laurence Fishburne, Selena Gomez (Spring Breakers), and Anton Yelchin (Star Trek Into Darkness).  There’s a very solid chance that Rudderless will make its premiere at a festival like Sundance next year.\n\n\n#7 LIAM HEMSWORTH TO STAR IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MOVIE CALLED THE RAVEN\n\nLiam Hemsworth inevitably still gets confused with his brother Chris (the one who is Thor), who is not the one who was in The Hunger Games.  Well, now, he’s going to star in a movie that itself will be confused with a movie last year starring John Cusack. Liam Hemsworth is in advanced talks to star in The Raven, which has zero to do with Edgar Allen Poe, and is instead based upon a 2010 short film by director Ricardo de Montreuil. The Raven is described as a sci-fi conspiracy thriller set in a future version of Los Angeles.  Universal Pictures is producing and distributing.  Consider this a borderline Fresh/Rotten toss up, because we really don’t have much to go on besides what we can gather from watching the original short film on YouTube.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 AFTER SERVING IN WORLD WAR Z, BRAD PITT ENLISTS FOR THE WORLD WAR II TANK MOVIE FURY\n\nNobody knows anything in Hollywood, so “everybody” could be wrong, but the common perception is that World War Z has a strong chance at being one of the summer’s biggest flops.  As such, Brad Pitt is understandably looking to do something completely different next, even if it’s really easy to draw comparisons, just based on his next film’s title.  Brad Pitt is in talks to star in Fury, a World War II drama about a five man tank team that finds itself facing a massive German army in the final days of the war in 1945. Fury will be directed by David Ayer (Harsh Times, Street Kings, End of Watch), and it’s the amount of green splotches on his RT Tomatometer page that make Fury a Rotten Idea this week.  Filming of Fury is expected to start in September, 2013.\n\n\n\t\n#1 HERCULES 3D CONFIRMS WHAT THE LATEST PAIR OF DUELING MOVIES WILL BE ABOUT\n\nIn the same way that a gas station on a corner means there will be another one across the street within a year, Hollywood loves the concept of “dueling movies,” in which two movies from competing studios have the same basic premise.  Volcanos, manned missions to blow up asteroids, attacks on the White House, Snow White, and Steve Prefontaine biopics are among the subjects this has happened to in the past.  To that list, you can now officially add 2014 movies about the Greek mythological hero Hercules.  Director Renny Harlin expects to start filming in Bulgaria in May on a movie called Hercules 3D which will be directly competing with a movie called Hercules, which will be directed by Brett Ratner and star Dwayne Johnson.  In Renny Harlin’s movie, the Greek hero will be played Kellan Lutz of The Twilight Saga.  Harlin’s movie is budgeted at $70 million, and is expected to be released in March, 2014, several months before MGM and Paramount are releasing Ratner’s movie on August 8, 2014.  While Ratner’s film is expected to be more “fantastic,” Renny Harlin’s film is being compared (by Harlin) to Gladiator, saying that, “It’s not a comic book, cartoony fantasy thing.”  Renny Harlin apparently didn’t get the memo that many people don’t necessarily use “comic book” as an insult anymore.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"cancelled, Set, Poppins, Animation, Pop, cancelled","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Third-GI-Joe-Movie-Now-In-Development"},{"id":"47509212334687","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Jurassic Park Set to Reopen in Summer of 2014","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Jurassic Park Set to Reopen in Summer of 2014\n                        Plus, a Hot Tub Time Machine sequel and new roles for Emma Stone, Bradley Cooper, and Anne Hathaway.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 18, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup covered a seven day period in which Hollywood recovered from weeks of almost zero activity with enough newsworthy movie development announcements for two of these columns.  Indeed, this writer expects some omissions to be pointed out by commenters, but hey, there’s only ten slots available each week.  The stories that did make the cut include high profile sequels (Jurassic Park IV, Pirates of the Caribbean 5), a much lower profile sequel (Hot Tub Time Machine 2), remakes (Ben-Hur and possibly Gremlins), and the inevitable Lance Armstrong biopic.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nJURASSIC PARK IV FINALLY GETS A RELEASE DATE\n\nThere were arguably a handful of movies this week that could have received the distinction as the week’s “top story.”  The idea of a fourth Jurassic Park however has been lingering around for so long (Jurassic Park III came out in 2001), that it won out, even though this is the third time in two years that Jurassic Park IV got the headline (previously, here and here).  And now, to the actual news, which is admittedly pretty skimpy on details:  Universal Pictures has scheduled Jurassic Park IV for June 13, 2014, and it will be released in 3D (like the original movie will be for its rerelease in April).  Whether or not the title will use Roman numerals appears up for debate.   This news comes not long after Steven Spielberg delayed filming of Robopocalypse, which begs the question of whether he will, in fact, be directing Jurassic Park IV, or merely producing it (as it currently, officially stands).   This caps a week full of release dates (mostly because studios announce their yearly plans at the beginning of the year; see how that works?):   The newly revived Picturehouse will release the drama/concert movie mashup Metallica Through the Never, starring Dane DeHaan, on August 9, 2013; Machete Kills, at one time thought to be going direct to video, will “hit” theaters on September 13, 2013;  Alfonso Cuaron’s Gravity comes out October 4, 2013; and MGM and Paramount will release Brett Ratner’s Hercules comic book adaptation, starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, on August 8, 2014.   See the Pirates of the Caribbean 5 news down below for more release dates (from Disney).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 MUST BE SOME KIND OF HOT TUB TIME MACHINE… SEQUEL\n\nHigh concept comedies sometimes succeed by a different barometer than most other genres.  Movies like Zoolander and Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery can open to “okay” box office domestically, but then do much, much better after their theatrical release.  So much so that they eventually get sequels (it may not have happened yet, but Zoolander 2 is still in development).  And that brings us to Hot Tub Time Machine, which only made $50 million domestically in 2010 on a production budget of $36 million.  Thanks, however, to such vehicles as Comedy Central, Hot Tub Time Machine now has a growing audience that belies the realities of that original theatrical release.  And so, MGM, that studio so known today for remaking its old hits, is in early negotiations to instead make a sequel to Hot Tub Time Machine.  These preliminary discussions include director Steve Pink, and stars Rob Corddry, Clark Duke, and Craig Robinson.  John Cusack is notably not in discussion for the sequel, and now, here’s some speculation as to why (besides possibly more obvious reasons, like he doesn’t want to do it).  Just as Hot Tub Time Machine took the characters back to the 1980s, one would have to speculate that the logical target for the sequel would be the 1990s.  If the sequel does target a different decade, it might make more sense for the “John Cusack slot” (whose casting was an homage to his 1980s movies) might go to an actor who is more associated with 1990s movies.  Teen comedies sort of went out of vogue for most of the 1990s, but one film that did quite well was Clueless, and Paul Rudd seems like someone who might be sort of perfect… if this is the approach that Steve Pink and MGM plan on taking.  Admittedly, there’s more than one “if” within all of that.  Rob Corddry may team up with Steve Pink to work on the screenplay.\n\n\n\t\n#2 WITH THAT NAME, IT WAS INEVITABLE: ANNE HATHAWAY TO DO SHAKESPEARE WITH THE TAMING OF THE SHREW\n\nFirst off, for those wondering what that title implies, here’s a theatrical history lesson (weird, huh?).  And now, the actual story, which is that Anne Hathaway is reportedly attached to star in a new adaptation of William Shakespeare’s play The Taming of the Shrew, about a woman with a fiery personality named Katherina who is courted contentiously by a rapscallion named Petruchio.  The Taming of the Shrew has been adapted many times, including a 1967 dramatic version starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Cole Porter’s Broadway musical Kiss Me Kate, and even an episode of Moonlighting.  This latest version will be set in Italy (the play was set in Padua) in the mid 20th Century.  It’s not yet known if Hathaway will be playing an Italian herself.  Screenwriter Abi Morgan (The Iron Lady) will adapt the screenplay for a new British production company with a first look deal with Working Title Films, which likewise has a first look deal with Universal Pictures.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THE LANCE ARMSTRONG BIOPIC IS CALLED CYCLE OF LIES… SEE WHAT THEY DID THERE?\n\nThis story, one has to imagine, probably got started quite a while ago, but was kept hush-hush until after a certain TV interview last night. J.J. Abrams, Bad Robot, Paramount Pictures, and producer Bryan Burk have started development on a Lance Armstrong biopic based upon the upcoming book by Juliet Macur called Cycle of Lies: The Fall of Lance Armstrong.  As the title pretty clearly intimates, the tone here will be negative/damning. Cycle of Lies is announced in pretty stark contrast to the Lance Armstrong movie that Jake Gyllenhaal was attached to star in years ago, which would have been more of a glowing ode to athletic accomplishment, probably even with a certain “USA! USA! USA!” vibe (or maybe even this more NSFW vibe).  There’s no word yet about whether Sheryl Crow might contribute to the soundtrack. Lance Armstrong sort of overshadowed what should have been the big news for Bad Robot this week, which is that Ron Howard is now attached to direct a movie for Bad Robot called All I’ve Got.  Based on a 2003 Israeli TV movie, All I’ve Got tells the story of a woman in the afterlife who is given the chance to go back and relive what her life would have been if her original lover hadn’t died in a horrific car accident.\n\n\n\t\n#4 EMMA STONE TO ENTER THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S CRIMSON PEAK\n\nAlthough much of the press about this week’s new horror release Mama would have you think it’s the new movie from director Guillermo del Toro, as any fan of giant robots knows by now, that distinction actually belongs to Pacific Rim.  Though Pacific Rim is still a few months away, GDT is already casting up his next film as director, which will be called Crimson Peak.  Specific details are being kept hush hush at the moment, but it’s variably described as being either a ghost story, or more precisely, a haunted house movie (which usually also includes ghosts).   The first name to be mentioned this week was Emma Stone, followed by Charlie Hunnam, who is also costarring in Pacific Rim.  Although this casting is being done now, filming isn’t expected to actually start until February, 2014, after Guillermo del Toro wraps filming of the pilot episode for the FX series The Strain, based upon a novel that GDT cowrote.\n\n\n\t\n#5 BRADLEY COOPER TO STAR IN THE SPY MOVIE TO (PROBABLY NOT) END ALL SPY MOVIES: DARK INVASION\n\nIt’s been written about a lot over the years, but the fact still remains: World War II receives a lot more coverage from modern movies than World War I does.  The reason for this is probably because WWII just has better villains.  Hopefully, that’s not too blunt of a way of putting it, but Nazis are pretty evil as far as villains go; anyway, this story isn’t about Nazis.  Warner Bros has acquired the film rights to an upcoming (September 11, 2013) non-fiction book by Harold Blum called Dark Invasion, with an eye towards it being a star vehicle for Bradley Cooper.  Presuming the movie actually gets made someday, Cooper will be playing NYPD Captain Tom Tunney, who is tasked in 1915 with bringing down a ring of German spies intent on preventing the USA from entering the war against Germany.  Harold Blum says in the book that the CIA considers Tunney to be the first head of homeland security, and though there’s nothing like that online anywhere that I could find, maybe that’s just the CIA doing their job.\n\n\n\t\n#6 THE WEEK IN NON-STORIES THAT FEEL LIKE REALLY BIG STORIES: ZACK SNYDER’S STAR WARS SPINOFF, AND THE GREMLINS REBOOT\n\nThis first story received a lot of online attention this week for obvious reasons, but what wasn’t as well covered was the fact that it was quickly denied (not that such denunciations are always 100% truthful).  Anyway, the story was that Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen, and the upcoming Superman movie Man of Steel) would be developing a Star Wars spinoff movie that would exist outside the new trilogy, with a story that is like Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai, except with Jedi Knights.   The idea that there could be Star Wars spinoff movies mostly comes from the idea that Walt Disney Pictures might want to be able to put out more Star Wars movies than just those within the strict limitations of a trilogy (something hinted at by various statements in recent months).  That story came from Vulture, as did this one, which involves another cherished 1980s franchise: Warner Bros is reportedly very interested in rebooting Gremlins.  However, there is almost no “there” there, as any potential movie would require a deal with Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment, and for various reasons (namely cost and Spielberg’s demand that he be involved), that deal is unlikely to happen.  Both Star Wars and Gremlins get news stories lots of page hits though.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\n#3 THE FIFTH PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN GETS A 2015 RELEASE DATE\n\nBesides Jurassic Park IV (and for some people, possibly more so), the announcement this week of a July 10, 2015 release date for the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean was probably the biggest news.  Walt Disney Pictures also announced the signing of screenwriter Jeff Nathanson to work on Pirates of the Caribbean 5.  Nathanson is usually credited as being the screenwriter of Catch Me If You Can, but his other credits also include story work on Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and sole screenwriting credits on the sequels Rush Hour 2 and Rush Hour 3.  Along with the release date came reports that Johnny Depp is signed to once again play Captain Jack Sparrow, but the curious thing there is that one would think that would have been the lead story, as opposed to the release date or the screenwriter.  There was news back in 2011 that Depp was in negotiations, so maybe those talks went so well that Disney never thought it necessary to re-publicize his involvement.  That would make sense, of course, except for the fact that a studio keeping quiet about Johnny Depp starring in their hugely expensive tentpole release seems… sort of weird.  Anyway, other Disney release dates announced this week included The Muppets 2 (3/21/14), Maleficent (7/2/14), and Brad Bird’s science fiction drama 1952 (12/19/14), starring George Clooney.\n\n\n\t\n#2 NOW THAT SCHWARZENEGGER IS BACK, SO IS TERMINATOR 5, WITH NEW SCREENWRITERS\n\nA little over a year ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s career as a movie star was very much in question.   The question was whether people would spark again to the former Governor of California, or if they would find his custodial transgressions too unlikable.  Well, The Expendables 2 came out, and the movie did well, without much of a peep or complaint about the fact that Schwarzenegger was in it. Meanwhile, Arnold Schwarzenegger kept up with a fairly steady work load, including this week’s The Last Stand, The Tomb with Sylvester Stallone, and a commitment to reprise his Cimmerian role in The Legend of Conan.  Of course, all of that being written, it’s worth noting that we don’t actually know to what extent Arnold Schwarzenegger might ever appear in another Terminator movie again.  Regardless, it would also be sort of silly to pretend that the actor and the franchise aren’t pretty well linked.  The slowing down in development of the fifth Terminator did, after all, seem to happen in roughly the same period as the temporary cooling off by Hollywood towards Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Anyway, development is back on for the fifth movie, with screenwriters Laeta Kalogridis (Pathfinder, Shutter Island) and Patrick Lussier (cowriter of Drive Angry, Dracula III: Legacy) now hired to start work.  This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based mostly on the declining RT scores for the Terminator franchise itself, but also a little bit because of (some of) the RT scores for the screenwriters.\n\n\n\t\n#1 HOW DO YOU FIGHT THE IDEA OF REMAKING BEN-HUR?\n\nObviously, there are some movies that get remade or revisited fairly frequently (Dracula, A Star is Born, and Les Miserables come to mind).  And adaptations of the 1880 Lew Wallace novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ were happening way before that really famous one in 1959 starring Charlton Heston. Having said that, some movies become so successful or cemented within the popular consciousness, that once they happen, they pretty much kill the concept going forward. Titanic is arguably one such movie.  Regardless, MGM, that studio so inseparably in love with remakes, made a lot of money in 2012 (thanks, Skyfall and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey!), and so they’re only more invested in remakes than ever.   Which brings us to Ben-Hur, which they’re planning on remaking again, except this time, they want to spend more screen time on the Jesus Christ part of “A Tale of the Christ.”  They probably won’t be calling Mel Gibson.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"sequel, drama, New, Film, Disney, joker, facebook, Pet, Star, Channel, versus, color","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Jurassic-Park-Set-to-Reopen-in-Summer-of-2014"},{"id":"47509212337761","title":"Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Stories of 2012","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Stories of 2012\n                        Recounting the best movie news announced each month of last year.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 4, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThe Yearly Ketchup continues on from last week’s review of the 12 most “Rotten Ideas” with twelve of the year’s top stories, most of which were classified under the “Fresh Developments” banner.  There’s a little bit of everything here, as long as your definition of “everything” is limited mostly to superheroes, Star Trek, Tolkien, and Star Wars.\n\n\n\nFRESH DEVELOPMENT OF THE YEAR\n\t\nDISNEY, LUCASFILM, AND STAR WARS EPISODE VII\n\nFor the most part, the compiling of this column entry involved careful skimming of each week’s Ketchup, but October saved this writer a lot of time.  The October 30, 2012 news that the Walt Disney Company had acquired LucasFilm for $4.05 billion was easily the biggest movie development story of the year.  The reason is that this deal also started development on a third trilogy of movies that will begin with Star Wars Episode VII to be released in 2015.  It also started a cascading snowball effect throughout the rest of 2012 as various stories were published online (especially) in November, all about who might or might not be directing, or what characters and actors may or may not be appearing.  We still don’t know yet who that director actually will be, but we will surely know that when the next Yearly Ketchup is written, and there’s actually a good chance that story might take the lead again in early 2014 as well.\n\n\n\n\t\nJANUARY: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH IS THE VILLAIN IN STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS (WHOEVER HE TURNS OUT TO BE)\n\nOn one hand, it might seem like movie fans have known for much longer than a year that Benedict Cumberbatch is playing the villain in the sequel Star Trek Into Darkness.  However, another year of that knowledge still hasn’t really changed much in regards to knowing exactly who that villain will be.  The official pre-release line is that Cumberbatch plays a character named John Harrison.  However, in the last year, we’ve also heard about Cumberbatch possibly playing super psychic Gary Mitchell.  And of course, there’s the persisting notion that he’s really Khan under a cover identity (or something like that).  The answer isn’t that far away, as Paramount Pictures is releasing Star Trek Into Darkness on May 17, 2013.\n\n\n\t\nFEBRUARY: EDGAR WRIGHT TO DIRECT JOHNNY DEPP IN THE NIGHT STALKER\n\nThis story made the annual list for two reasons:  February had a pretty high “Rotten Idea” ratio, and this writer had forgotten that this story had ever happened in the first place.  Therefore, it’s probably a good nominee to be revisited by other movie fans eleven months later, as well.  Basically, Johnny Depp is producing and is likely to star in a Walt Disney Pictures adaptation of the 1970s ABC TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker.  Director Edgar Wright was also hired for The Night Stalker right at the start of development.  Wright’s involvement on this project has probably been so quickly forgotten because most attention has been given to either this year’s The World’s End (Wright’s thematic follow up to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz), or his Ant-Man movie for Marvel Studios, to be released on November 6, 2015. As for what The Night Stalker itself is actually about, it’s pretty easy to synopsize: Kolchak is a newspaper reporter who has a knack for repeatedly investigating stories involving supernatural creatures (vampires, zombies, werewolves, etc).  Of course, all of this presumes that Johnny Depp still wants to star in a movie adapting a 1970s TV show involving vampires after the “meh” box office performance this year of Dark Shadows.\n\n\n\t\nMARCH: AFTER YEARS OF BAD NEWS, ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND CONTINUES… WILL ACTUALLY CONTINUE\n\nThis might be another story that seems like we’ve known about much longer than we actually have.  But nope, it was only back on March 28, 2012 that Will Ferrell dressed up like Ron Burgundy and went on the Conan show to announce that Paramount had given a greenlight to the sequel Anchorman: The Legend Continues.  Since then, we’ve seen a teaser trailer in theaters, much of the original cast has been confirmed as returning, and a release date of December 20, 2013 has been set by Paramount.  Director Adam McKay is also returning, and cowrote the script with Will Ferrell.  Filming of Anchorman: The Legend Continues is scheduled to start next month in February, 2013.\n\n\n\t\nAPRIL: SIR BEN KINGSLEY CAST AS THE BIG BAD IN IRON MAN 3 (WHO IS TOTALLY WHO EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE)\n\nSome of the skepticism over the character misdirect concerning the villain in Star Trek Into Darkness is that the movie fan community has experienced this sort of thing before (and frequently).  Heck, it even happened this year, with a completely different sequel and villain.  It all started when Sir Ben Kingsley was cast as “the villain” in Iron Man 3 (scheduled for release on May 3, 2013).  The writing of the casting announcement nearly stumbled over itself trying to establish that Kingsley would not be playing The Mandarin, Iron Man’s comic book archnemesis (whose existence was also teased in the first movie).  This wouldn’t be quite as hilarious if we didn’t all know that, yeah, he totally is playing The Mandarin.\n\n\n\t\nMAY: KICK-ASS 2 IS ANOTHER 2013 SEQUEL THAT, BEFORE 2012, SEEMED LIKE IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN\n\nContinuing the trend from our March story, this year also saw the sudden rejuvenation of the sequel Kick-Ass 2 after a (albeit shorter) period in which it seemed likely to end up being scrapped.  In the case of Kick-Ass 2, the reason why things changed so suddenly seemed to be most obviously linked to the “super” over-performance of The Avengers, the results of which emerged just two days before the greenlight for Kick-Ass 2 was announced.  Right around here, however, it should be noted that, except for the colorful outfits, The Avengers and Kick-Ass really don’t have much in common at all.  Indeed, Kick-Ass is nearly the opposite of The Avengers in many ways.  Regardless, Universal Pictures now has Kick-Ass 2 scheduled for release on June 28, 2013.\n\n\n\t\nJUNE: WARNER BROS AND DC COMICS RAMP UP THEIR BIG PUSH TOWARDS JUSTICE LEAGUE IN 2015\n\nThis story was actually part of a bigger arc (if you will) that stretched throughout the year, but the gist of it all started in early June, after it was clear that The Avengers would go down as the #3 box office success of all time.  That’s around the time that Warner Bros and DC Comics started getting really serious about jumpstarting a Justice League movie sooner rather than later (the summer of 2015, specifically).  Not really enough is known about the Justice League movie at this point to say with full confidence that it will end up being a “Fresh Development” for movie fans, but it’s certainly one for DC fans who want to see characters like the Flash, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman get the same sort of big screen attention that The Avengers received in 2012.  “Justice League in 2015″ might not end up being the “Freshest” story of the year, but it certainly was one of the biggest.  All we really know at this point, still, is that Justice League is being adapted by Gangster Squad screenwriter Will Beall (he also does a lot of work on the Castle TV show), and that the villain might be Darkseid.  The Justice League plan is also opposite that of Marvel’s: rather than following several movies featuring its heroes, the Justice League movie will come first (or second, if Man of Steel counts), and then some of the heroes might then get their own movies later on.\n\n\n\nJULY: COMIC-CON BRINGS THE NEWS FROM PETER JACKSON OF THE THIRD HOBBIT MOVIE\n\nThere were definitely a lot of big movie stories that came out of this year’s San Diego Comic-Con.  The single biggest movie that was hinted at there will probably end up being the 2015 release The Hobbit: There and Back Again.  Until that point, aside from some rumors pointing at the possibility, the world was under the impression that Peter Jackson’s adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit would be released as two (albeit very long) movies.  The idea had been around for a while that Jackson was supplementing the story of The Hobbit with both world-building back story and Lord of the Rings foreshadowing.  That included the addition to the films of characters that weren’t even mentioned in the actual book (like Legolas), or the expansion of other characters from just a teensy mention (like Radagast the Brown). Just six months later, we probably have a much better understanding of why the third film was added to Jackson’s adaptation, since most people who care about any of this have probably seen The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey at least once. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug will be released on December 13, 2013, and The Hobbit: There and Back Again will be released on July 18, 2014.\n\n\n\t\nAUGUST: THE NEXT X-MEN MOVIE (NOT COUNTING THE WOLVERINE) CONFIRMED TO ADAPT DAYS OF FUTURE PAST\n\nThe significance of this particular story might depend upon how much one is into the 1970s-1980s Uncanny X-Men comics written by Chris Claremont, which basically took one of Marvel’s worst selling titles and made it the cultural behemoth that it is today.  It was in August that we found out that the movie previously thought of as the “sequel to X-Men: First Class” would also tie in the first three X-Men movies as part of an adaptation of the classic 1981 time travel storyline Days of Future Past.  It won’t be anything close to an exact adaptation for obvious reasons (Kitty Pryde not being a 1960s X-Men member, for example).  However, the involvement of Bryan Singer as director for the first time on an X-Men movie since X2 is promising.  Filming is expected to start on X-Men: Days of Future Past soon in 2013, with 20th Century Fox having already scheduled this seventh* movie featuring Marvel’s mutants for release on July 18, 2014.  *The Wolverine comes out this year on July 26, 2013.\n\n\n\t\nSEPTEMBER: DREAMWORKS ANIMATION ANNOUNCES AMBITIOUS TWELVE FILM SLATE FOR 2013-2016\n\nThe challenge for this particular column entry is the balance between it being a list of the “freshest” movie development stories, or the “biggest” stories.  In the end, it basically has to be more of the latter than the former, because, frankly, we’re talking about movies that haven’t been released yet, and “big” is much easier to quantify than “good.”  As “big” as some of these stories have been this year, in sheer volume, few can add up to the numbers demonstrated in this September story.  It was then that DreamWorks Animation confirmed a four year release schedule for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 that included twelve new animated films.  DreamWorks Animation may not be the critical darling that Pixar is, but they’ve had a number of really big hits, and some of those were indeed beloved by critics and moviegoers alike, as well. DreamWorks’ 2013-2016 schedule includes sequels (How to Train Your Dragon 2, How to Train Your Dragon 3, and Kung Fu Panda 3), a spinoff (The Penguins of Madagascar), and a retro TV show adaptation (Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman).  The various movies that don’t fall into any of those three categories are The Croods, Turbo, Me and My Shadow, Happy Smekday!, Trolls, B.O.O.: Bureau of Otherworldly Operations, and Mumbai Musical (which is probably a working title).\n\n\n\t\nNOVEMBER: THE DIRECTOR OF FOUR HARRY POTTER FILMS WILL NEXT TAKE A (VINE) SWING AT TARZAN\n\nMaybe the movie industry spent the month in shock following the Star Wars Episode VII news, or maybe it was just a slow month because of those long holidays Hollywood likes to take.  Whatever the reason, November lacked a truly obvious “big story.” It could also have to do with how “awards season” makes the industry think more about attracting future nominations, and less about the sort of big, flashy movies that attract interest here.  Warner Bros may have a little bit of both, however, depending upon how the studio’s long-planned revival of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan ends up being realized.  Tarzan won the distinction of being the film that director David Yates finally said “yes” to after a year of trying to find his next post-Harry Potter “go project.”  This story also came in the same year that Edgar Rice Burroughs’ other most famous hero, John Carter, landed with something of a thud in (American) theaters. Warner Bros obviously thinks Tarzan, with decades of movie history under his loincloth, has a better chance of connecting.\n\n\n\t\nDECEMBER: A SEQUEL TO WRECK-IT RALPH WILL HAPPEN, AND MARIO WILL HAVE A LARGE ROLE IN IT, TOO\n\nWhatever was written about November being a slow-ish news month goes double for December, for two obvious Holiday-related reasons (one was on the 25th, the other had 8 crazy nights).  A fairly big story that did emerge, however, is probably in the “well, yeah, duh” category (especially fun if you imagine Sarah Silverman saying that).  That’s because a sequel to Wreck-It Ralph is now pretty much a certainty, as the first film is on its way to possibly earning over $300 million worldwide (as of this writing, it’s at $277 million).  Disney’s homage to the era of classic arcade video games has a lot of potential material for the sequel (and maybe even “sequels”), as there’s more to video games than just the arcade era, and more to be nostalgic about than just the 1980s, or even, for that matter, the 1990s.  Already included in the public discussions about the sequel is Nintendo’s Mario, who nearly was featured in the first film.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Winners, Sundance","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Yearly-Ketchup-The-Freshest-Stories-of-2012"},{"id":"47509213408874","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Disney Buys Lucasfilm, Schedules Star Wars: Episode VII for 2015","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Disney Buys Lucasfilm, Schedules Star Wars: Episode VII for 2015\n                        Plus, new roles for Jamie Foxx, Michael Fassbender, Colin Firth, Paul Giamatti, and more.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 2, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week in movie development news pretty much seemed to begin and end with Star Wars: Episode VII.  There was, however, actually other stuff going on, including Jamie Foxx in talks to play an Amazing Spider-Man 2 villain, and new roles for Zac Efron, Michael Fassbender, Colin Firth, Paul Giamatti, and Kurt Russell.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWALT DISNEY PICTURES BUYS LUCASFILM AND PROMISES STAR WARS: EPISODE VII FOR 2015\n\nMost weeks, this writer has to take some time to decide what the “Top Story” is for that week’s Ketchup.  This week, not so much.  This may just be the top movie development story of the year, much less the month or week.  And, if you’re reading this column, you probably already know about it, but play along as if it’s news, and maybe one of these details will be new to you.  Walt Disney Pictures has purchased LucasFilm from its sole owner, a Mr. George Lucas of Marin County, for the amount of $4.05 billion.  Although LucasFilm is the company behind lots of other things too (like say, the Indiana Jones franchise), Disney’s acquisition is almost entirely for the rights of the Star Wars franchise, including all the various media (movies, TV, games, toys, etc) that it encompasses.  Specifically, more immediately — and for the fans, most intriguingly — is the big announcement that Walt Disney Pictures will be releasing Star Wars: Episode VII in theaters sometime (almost certainly in the summer) in 2015.  Star Wars: Episode VIII and Star Wars: Episode IX will follow in 2017 and 2019, respectively.  As part of the deal, George Lucas will continue to serve as an advisor for the franchise, but he will not be writing or directing any of the films in the new trilogy.   Well, that’s only slightly true, as Lucas has indeed written story treatments for episodes 7-9, but he won’t be the writer of the actual scripts.  We don’t know for sure what the story will entail, except that it won’t be based on any of the various Star Wars novels which have already covered in detail the events of (much of) the rest of the lives of characters like Luke, Leia, Han Solo, and their kids (and are usually considered to be “canon”).  The search for the writer of Episode 7 is currently ongoing. We know that people have been talking behind closed doors about this new trilogy of sequels because Mark Hamill revealed as much this week, saying that he and Carrie Fisher met with George Lucas this past summer; what’s unclear is whether they would actually appear in them.  The sticking point could be that Star Wars: Episode VII will be set about 20 years after Return of the Jedi, when Luke Skywalker is in his late 30s or early 40s, and Mark Hamill is already 61.  Instead, it seems likely that younger actors will be cast as the older versions of the series’ characters.  The move to Disney has got to be a blow for 20th Century Fox, the studio that released the first six Star Wars movies.  The situation also represents a quandary for future boxed sets, as 20th Century Fox retains rights to Star Wars in perpetuity, and the other five movies until 2020.  There’s still some money left for 20th Century Fox theatrically, however, as the studio’s deal to release 3D versions of Episode II and Episode III in 2013 and 2014 remains. As for that $4.05 billion that George Lucas is receiving, it’s not just going in his bank account.  Instead, George Lucas is expected to donate most of that money to the various education-related charities that he supports.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 SHOCKING NEWS: JAMIE FOXX TO PLAY ELECTRO IN THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2\n\nMany of the most popular comic book superheroes were created in a time (1940s to 1960s) when (for whatever reasons) “caucasian” was the default race for most characters.  In the 21st century, much has been done to balance this issue out, which has included such changes of race as Pete Jones on Smallville (possibly the first of this trend), Kingpin in Daredevil, Heimdall in Thor, and Nick Fury in the Marvel Studios movies (a change that actually happened first in the “Ultimate” line of comics).  This week, Jamie Foxx was announced as being in negotiations to play the villain Electro in the sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man.   In addition to being caucasian, Max “Electro” Dillon is also skinny/lanky, sports a bright green costume with yellow lightning bolts coming off his head, and in the Ultimate version, he’s completely bald because his electric power effectively removed his hair via electrolysis.  It’s also worth noting that there has already been a long-running African American superhero with almost exactly the same powers as Electro, which is Black Lightning, who dates back to the 1970s when African-American characters frequently had the word “Black” in their name. It’s currently unknown whether Jamie Foxx’s Electro costume will feature those awesome yellow lightning bolts.  Perhaps the film can spend half its running time explaining exactly what keeps those things from flopping over.\n\n\n\t\n#2 MICHAEL FASSENDER AND COLIN FIRTH TO SQUARE OFF OVER WHO’S MORE OF A GENIUS\n\nColin Firth and Michael Fassbender have signed on to star in the literary biopic Genius about publishing editor Max Perkins (Firth), and his relationships with various early 20th century authors, including Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Thomas Wolfe (Fassbender).  Filming will start in early 2014, around the time that Fassbender will turn 37, which was the age that Thomas Wolfe was when he died of tuberculosis, soon after he had reconciled differences with Perkins.  British actor Michael Grandage will make his directorial debut with Genius, working from a script by screenwriter John Logan, whose other upcoming films include Darren Aronofsky’s Noah, Jon Favreau’s Jersey Boys, and the next three James Bond movies (including Skyfall).  Logan’s script is an adaptation of the biography Max Perkins: Editor of Genius, by A. Scott Berg, who also wrote biographies of Samuel Goldwin, Katherine Hepburn, and Charles Lindbergh.\n\n\n\t\n#3 GUILLERMO DEL TORO RUMOR OF THE WEEK:  A SUPERNATURAL SUPER TEAM MOVIE CALLED HEAVEN SENT?\n\nThe movie websites of today are admittedly a lot slicker than our collective roots, but there are still sites out there like Ain’t It Cool News and Latino Review that harken back to that earlier, more rambunctious time.  This story does indeed come from Latino Review, and it’s also completely unconfirmed at this point, but it’s also such a cool story, that we had to include it.  Latino Review is claiming that Guillermo Del Toro so impressed Warner Bros with Pacific Rim that they have been trying to get him interested in other projects (like a V movie or a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory sequel).  What Guillermo Del Toro really wants to do instead is supposedly called Heaven Sent.  If it’s real, Heaven Sent would be a sort of super team movie featuring various “supernatural” heroes from DC Comics, which has way more such characters than Marvel does.  The list of potential characters includes The Spectre, Deadman, Swamp Thing, Phantom Stranger, Zatanna, John Constanine: Hellblazer, and Etrigan the Demon.  Of course, the down side to all of this is… this story could be completely bogus.  But if it’s real… the idea of Guillermo Del Toro being allowed to play with the very big toy box of the DC Comics magical characters is sort of a fanboy’s dream.\n\n\n\t\n#4 HORROR/WESTERN HYBRID BONE TOMAHAWK ATTRACTS KURT RUSSELL AND OTHERS\n\nThere is a certain casting technique, arguably perfected by Quentin Tarantino, in which a young director shows off his influences via the actor that he casts in his first film(s).  That appears to be what’s going on with the horror/western hybrid Bone Tomahawk from first time director S. Craig Zahler.  If that’s true, then it’s possible that Zahler is a fan of the 1980s films of John Carpenter (Kurt Russell), The Cabin in the Woods (Richard Jenkins), Boys Don’t Cry (Peter Sarsgaard), and the Showtime series Dexter (Jennifer Carpenter).  Or… all of those connections might just be coincidental.  Bone Tomahawk will be about four men who team up to rescue people being held captive by a group of cannibal troglodytes (aka cavemen).\n\n\n\t\n#5 THE JFK ASSASSINATION DRAMA PARKLAND ATTRACTS THREE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEES\n\nParkland is the title of a drama that Tom Hanks is producing about the Dallas hospital where President John F. Kennedy, his (presumed) assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, and his assassin Jack Ruby all died in November, 1963.  Filming is going to start soon so that the movie can be in theaters just in time for the 50th anniversary on November 22, 2013.  As part of that, casting is well underway, with awards-friendly actors Paul Giamatti, Billy Bob Thornton, and Jacki Weaver all now cast in Parkland.  The film will mark the directorial debut of Peter Landesman, who also wrote the script, based on material in the book Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, by Vincent Bugliosi, author of Helter Skelter (and yes, I got that right off the book’s cover).\n\n\n\t\n#6 THE (SECOND) BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL\n\nAlthough far more time was spent discussing the success of The Avengers, or the disappointment of John Carter, an underreported yet surprising story was exactly how popular The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was internationally.  Produced for the equivalent of $10 million, that British comedy has taken in over $134 million worldwide.  As such, it shouldn’t be surprising at all to discover that the film’s writer Ol Parker is now working on a sequel.  All of the cast members reportedly want to return, although that’s probably not possible for at least one of them (for obvious reasons).  It’s unknown what the sequel might be about, except that it will probably continue the stories of a bunch of elderly Brits living in a hotel in India, and might possibly add some new residents/cast members (as sequels usually do).  This is one of the Fresh Developments of the week due to the 77% “Fresh” rating on the RT Tomatometer (although this particular writer disagrees with that positive rating… just to get that out there).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\n#3 JASON STATHAM SEQUELS THE EXPENDABLES 3 AND THE MECHANIC 2 CONFIRMED AT AFM\n\nSome stories require a lot of explanation, but this one really doesn’t.  The American Film Market is an annual event in Santa Monica, California, where independent film producers hawk their movies to the distributors who actually get the movies in theaters around the world.  AFM took place this week, and two of the movies that are being sold there are the Jason Statham sequels The Expendables 3 and The Mechanic 2 (which is a sequel to a movie which was itself a remake).  Not much else is really known. As for why this is a Rotten Idea, well, it’s mostly because of the 53% Rotten RT Tomatometer score for The Mechanic.  As for The Expendables 3, well, maybe a third one is Rotten because eventually they will run out of aging action stars (though the eventual scraping of the bottom of the barrel could lead to some truly so-bad-they’re-great choices, so there is that).\n\n\n\t\n#2 ZAC EFRON SAYS TO HARRISON FORD, YOU BELONG TO ME\n\nHarrison Ford and Zac Efron are in talks to star in You Belong to Me, a psychological thriller which will be the next film from director Rob Reiner (Misery, Stand by Me).  Harrison Ford would play a psychiatrist who bonds with the brother (Efron) of one of his female patients who recently committed suicide, only to find that the brother starts seducing the doctor’s wife and daughter.  The tone of You Belong to Me is described as being like Cape Fear (because Cape Fear is a movie people generally like).   Although Reiner had a string of excellent films from 1984 to 1994, the last 18 years have seen mostly “Rotten” RT Tomatometer scores for the director, and that’s why this is a Rotten Idea this week.\n\n\t\n#1 THREE STORIES IN ONE: CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN TO AIRSPACE TO CELL\n\nSome weeks, the stories form Seven-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon style chains.  This story connects four movies, starting with the long-in-development notion of a movie based upon the long running Castle Wolfenstein video game series, a shooter series set during World War II that involves battling Nazis and the supernatural monsters they’ve created.  Or, as the independent producers described it, it’s sort of a cross between Captain America: The First Avengers and Inglourious Basterds, because those are movies people know and like (versus, say, comparing it to The Keep, Dead Snow, or Ilsa: She Wolf of the S.S.).   Anyway, at least one of those comparisons is probably because Roger Avary used to collaborate with Quentin Tarantino, and now Avary is the guy they’ve hired to write and direct the Castle Wolfenstein movie.  Roger Avary’s agent was quite busy this week, because he’s also been signed to direct the John Cusack airplane thriller Airspace, about a pilot who is chased mid-air by a “heavily armed MiG fighter pilot.” And that leads us to two more movies, in which John Cusack is also going to star, in a series of castings Nicolas Cage would envy.  Cell is the title of a Stephen King adaptation (Cusack also starred in the King adaptation 1408) about cellphone signals that turn people into massacre machines.  Cusack also signed on for Due Process, which is set in the exciting arena of world… (zzzz…) finances.  Here, Cusack will play a farmer who has to face off against two big city bankers who want to foreclose on his farm.  As for why all of this is Rotten?  Well, the two first two are because of Roger Avary’s RT Tomatometer scores.  As for all the John Cusack movies, well, it can be said at least that he’s only had one “Fresh” movie (Hot Tub Time Machine) in the last five years (since 1408 in 2007).\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Fox, Plus, social","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Disney-Buys-Lucasfilm-Schedules-Star-Wars-Episode-VII-for-2015"},{"id":"47509212348003","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Vin Diesel to Star in Big Screen Version of Kojak","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Vin Diesel to Star in Big Screen Version of Kojak\n                        Plus, updates on the Muppets sequel and casting news for Tom Hardy and Samuel L.

Things, however, will really slow down to a crawl until January (and indeed, the next two Fridays will see this column become the “Yearly Ketchup”).  The last news items of 2012 included two movies based on 1970s TV shows (Kojak and Gaiking), two sequels (the next Muppets, and The Expendables 3), a spinoff of Cars called Planes, and a biopic about the early career of Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWHO LOVES YA, BABY?  VIN DIESEL TO BE THE MOVIE VERSION OF KOJAK\n\nSome actors just perfectly age into a movie role, and when one hears of such a casting choice, one might think, “Well, yeah… duh.” The news this week that Vin Diesel is producing and will star in a feature film movie adaptation of Kojak is definitely an example of that.  This is especially for older fans who actually remember what Kojak was (but are also young enough to know who Vin Diesel is).  Telly Savalas starred as Greek-American (and follicly challenged) NYPD detective Theo Kojak in the gritty CBS drama that aired from 1973 to 1978.  Savalas’s Kojak was cocky, had a swagger about him, and could frequently be spotted sucking a lollipop; in the 30 years since, it’s become a cultural stereotype that has sort of overshadowed the original show (and its much less comedic tone) itself.  There was also an attempted Kojak reboot on the USA Network in 2005 that ran for one season, with Ving Rhames in the lead role (sans the Greek American background, which basically just made him a bald cop who likes lollipops).  Finally, in case anyone thinks Kojak is destined to be a joke project, the screenwriters have a fairly impressive claim to fame that may indicate otherwise.  Neal Purvis and Robert Wade are the British screenwriting team who were involved with five consecutive James Bond scripts in a row, starting with The World is Not Enough, right on through this year’s Skyfall.  And… here’s a a bit of last minute news:  Vin Diesel also said today that a studio wants to make a trilogy out of his long-standing interest in a movie based on the life of Hannibal the Conqueror.  Why is this not its own story?  That’s the price movie stars and filmmakers “get” for breaking big news at 3:48 PM on the Friday afternoon before Christmas.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 RICKY GERVAIS REPLACES JASON SEGEL AS THE HUMAN LEAD IN THE MUPPETS SEQUEL\n\nBasically all of the press to date about the casting of the sequel to The Muppets has been on the role of an Interpol agent, initially announced as being Christoph Waltz, who was then replaced by Ty Burrell of TV’s Modern Family.  This week, it was clarified that Burrell’s role is actually that of the sequel’s antagonist, and not the human lead protagonist, who would be essentially replacing Jason Segel (sort of).  Instead, that actor will be Ricky Gervais, who filmed a cameo appearance for the first film that was ultimately cut from the theatrical version.  The details of Gervais’ character aren’t yet known.  There’s also still a third main human character yet to be cast, who is most likely a female character (since Amy Adams is also unlikely to return).\n\n\n\t\n#2 THIS YEAR’S BLACK LIST OF UNPRODUCED SCREENPLAYS INCLUDES BIOPICS OF DR. SEUSS AND HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON IN THE TOP 10\n\nAnother year is coming to a close soon, and so we’re in that pre-Christmas week when the news cycle is slower than usual.  That’s also the cue for the online publication of the “Black List of Unproduced Screenplays,” which is the result of polling of hundreds of studio executives and producers who each year read all the scripts the rest of us don’t have access to as readily.  The Black List has in recent years become a common publicity tool, but one has to be a little wary; a script merely being “on the list” doesn’t necessarily mean much when the list itself includes almost 100 titles.  Instead, it might help more to pay attention to which scripts gained the most votes.  This year’s top choice was Draft Day, a sort of professional football version of Moneyball that has Kevin Costner and Ivan Reitman attached to star and direct, respectively (obviously).  Two newsworthy scripts that are also in the top five (#3 and #4) are both biopics: Seuss tells the story of how an artist named Theodor Geisel met his future wife who inspired him to write children’s books, starting with The Cat in the Hat. Seuss is in development at Illumination Entertainment, with Johnny Depp attached to star as Theodor “Ted” Geisel. Rodham tells the true story of a young rising star attorney named Hillary Rodham during the years of the Watergate scandal who is forced to choose between a promising political career and her ex-boyfriend from Arkansas.  Rodham was written by a newcomer named Young Il Kim, who is neither the former (and late) leader of North Korea, nor The Notorious K.I.M.\n\n\n\t\n#3 BANE AND (THE ORIGINAL) LISBETH VOLUNTEER FOR ANIMAL RESCUE\n\nQuite a bit of press has been given in recent months to Warner Bros and their two different anti-poaching projects that are being developed as potential vehicles for the triumvirate of Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, and Tom Hardy (who are all also producing).  This week, Fox Searchlight may have succeeded in (sort of) beating WB to the thematic punch, with one of those three, Tom Hardy, now signed to star in Animal Rescue, which also trades upon similar anti-animal-abuse themes.  Noomi Rapace (Prometheus) is also in talks to costar.  Author Dennis Lehane (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone) adapted the script based on a short story that first appeared in the collection Boston Noir.  Director Michael R. Roskam, whose first film Bullhead was Oscar nominated for Best Foreign Langue Film last year, will make his English language debut with Animal Rescue.  Tom Hardy will be playing a man who gets messed up with local gangsters after he finds a puppy in a trashcan.\n\n\n\t\n#4 AUBREY PLAZA AND JOHN C. REILLY TO STAR IN THE INDIE ZOMBIE COMEDY LIFE AFTER BETH\n\nHow familiar one is with Aubrey Plaza might have to do with a) whether you watch Parks and Recreation and/or b) how many recent indie-flavored movies like Mystery Team, Damsels in Distress, and (especially) Safety Not Guaranteed you’ve seen.  Plaza was also fairly prominently featured in the less-indie “comedies” Funny People and Scott Pilgrim vs the World.  Anyway, the deadpan actress’ gradual road to eventual superstardom (and/or hey-whatever-happened-to…) will include the indie zombie romantic comedy Life After Beth.  John C. Reilly is the film’s other star, but there’s no word yet as to whether either one of them will actually play a zombie (or maybe neither, or both… who knows?).  Reilly and Plaza might seem mismatched age-wise, but that might be deceiving as 28 year old Aubrey Plaza often plays characters much younger than her real age (and BTW, John C. Reilly himself is 47).   Life After Beth was written by screenwriter Jeff Baena, who cowrote I Heart Huckabees with director David O. Russell, and who will also be making his directorial debut with this one.\n\n\n\t\n#5 JACKIE CHAN CHECKS INTO THE ACTION STAR RETIREMENT HOME THAT IS THE EXPENDABLES 3\n\nThe action franchise that continues with The Expendables 3 is basically custom made for action stars that are nearing retirement age.  The second film added two notable stars known for their martial arts skills (Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme).  The Expendables 3 continues that theme with the news from Jackie Chan himself that he is now indeed on board for the sequel.  Chan is the first actor to officially join the franchise with The Expendables 3, following quickly debunked rumors earlier this year that Nicolas Cage had signed on (he hadn’t).  There’s no release date yet for The Expendables 3, but it’s looking increasingly likely that it won’t be until sometime in 2014.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#4 ANGELINA JOLIE TO DIRECT THE LOUIS ZAMPERINI BIOPIC UNBROKEN\n\nAlthough In the Land of Blood and Honey was given a 2011 Oscar season release and the baby steps of an awards season push, the directorial debut of Angelina Jolie was panned by many critics, earning it a “Rotten” rating of 56%.   Such a reception, however, won’t necessarily keep a plucky multi-millionaire, A-list actress, and Hollywood near-royalty from getting a second chance to prove her directorial talents.  And so, Angelina Jolie is in negotiations with Universal Pictures to direct their long-in-development biopic of Olympic athlete and World War II P.O.W. Louis Zamperini.  Unbroken is based upon the best selling non-fiction book by Laura Hilenbrand, who also wrote the book that provided the source material for Seabiscuit.  The latest draft of the Unbroken adaptation was written by screenwriter Richard LaGravenese, whose credits include Water for Elephants and The Bridges of Madison County.\n\n\n\n#3 DISNEY’S DIRECT-TO-VIDEO CARS SPINOFF PLANES IS INSTEAD FLYING DIRECT-TO-THEATERS\n\nIt’s perhaps difficult to imagine this today, considering the success of the film and Toy Story 3, but at one time, Pixar’s Toy Story 2 was supposed to have just been a direct-to-video release.  The connection of that analogy to today’s story, however, mostly ends there.  Planes is the title of a CGI animated movie (that was produced by Disney, not Pixar) that was originally intended as a direct-to-video spinoff of Pixar’s Cars franchise.  The plans changed today, however, as Walt Disney Pictures has now scheduled Planes for a theatrical release on August 9, 2013 (the same date as Neill Blomkamp’s Elysium and the comedy We’re the Millers). As for why Planes is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, it mostly has to do with the 38% “Rotten” score for Cars 2 (and that movie was at least produced by Pixar).  This writer also just has a problem with Pixar movies being sequelized or spun off in general… the Toy Story trilogy notwithstanding.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE GIANT ROBOTS OF PACIFIC RIM ATTRACT ATTENTION FOR MOVIES LIKE GAIKING\n\nIt’s funny how easy it is sometimes to draw a direct line between something that’s awesome and a similar project that gets news a week or two after that.  In this case, the first thing was the online debut on December 13 of the trailer for Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim, with all of the awesome Giant-Robots-vs-Giant-Monsters action that it promises to deliver.  And so, this week, the live action movie based on the 1970s cartoon known in the USA as Gaiking also got some news.  Namely, Valhalla Entertainment, the production company of Gale Anne Hurd, is joining forces with Toei Animation and All Nippon Entertainment Works for the Gaiking movie.  The idea of a Gaiking movie is hardly news, of course, as a test footage clip appeared online earlier this year.  The interest of Gale Anne Hurd, however, may help get things moving, as her past films include action movies like the last two entries in both the Punisher and Hulk franchises, and the first two Terminator movies.  So, we are possibly closer to getting a Gaiking movie, and yet, the world is still deprived of its big budget Voltron movie.  That also includes, for that matter, Shogun Warriors, though Gaiking actually was one of the Shogun Warriors toys back in the day.\n\n\n\t\n#1 SAMUEL L. JACKSON IS SICK OF THESE ***KING KITES IN HIS M*****F***ING MOVIE CALLED KITE\n\nThere’s definitely ways of spinning gold out of stories that a more cynical movie writer can also spin as being completely “Rotten.”  Take, for example, the new live action anime adaptation Kite, which will reunite Samuel L. Jackson with David Ellis, the director of Snakes on a Plane.  That movie has a special little warm and fuzzy place in the hearts and minds of many movie fans.  When one actually looks at Ellis’ RT Tomatometer page for his career as a director, what one finds is that Snakes on a Plane is the one “Fresh” film, and every other movie he’s directed (like Shark Night 3D and two of the Final Destination movies) is “Rotten.”  Anyway, you can read about the original Japanese Kite anime episodes here.  Samuel L. Jackson will likely be playing one of the corrupt detectives that takes in a girl who was orphaned by the double homicide of her parents, and then he and his partner proceed to train her in the ways of an assassin. This probably wasn’t exactly the perfect week, though, to be promoting a movie with that particular story element.  But, you know, this was also the week before the release of Django Unchained, and so, it was Jackson’s chance at free publicity for his next project.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Festival, language","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Vin-Diesel-to-Star-in-Big-Screen-Version-of-Kojak"},{"id":"47509212331613","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Warcraft Movie Finds New Life","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Warcraft Movie Finds New Life\n                        Plus, news for X-Men, Denzel Washington, Tom Hardy, Jessica Chastain, and Paul Giamatti in a good week.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 1, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes new roles for Paul Giamatti, Tom Hardy, Jeremy Renner, and Denzel Washington, and such ambitious “tentpole” type projects as The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Doctor Strange, Warcraft, and X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWARCRAFT MOVIE GETS RESURRECTED WITH A NEW DIRECTOR\n\nRecent weeks and months have brought forth a lot of talk about big movies that are loosely scheduled for release in 2015, including Star Wars Episode VII, The Avengers 2, Justice League, Avatar 2, Pirates of the Caribbean 5, the Fantastic Four reboot, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2.  Obviously, some of those movies will not actually get released in 2015 (it’s just sort of inevitable), but there’s another movie we can add to the realm of possibilities.  Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures have hired director Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code) to replace Sam Raimi as the director of their long-planned Warcraft movie adaptation.  And the plan is for the movie to start filming in the fall of 2013, aiming for a release sometime in 2015. Warcraft is of course the very popular fantasy gaming franchise that started as a real time strategy series in the 1990s before becoming the inspiration of one of the most successful MMORPGs in 2004 with the launching of World of Warcraft.   The news of Duncan Jones’ hiring was also soon followed by online rumors that Warner Bros is hoping to get Johnny Depp to star in an unspecified role.  The movie is described by various sites as being a World of Warcraft adaptation, but not enough is known about the premise of the script by Charles Leavitt (K-PAX, Blood Diamond) to say definitively which specific game in the Warcraft franchise it adapts (if any).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 PAUL GIAMATTI CAMPAIGNS FOR AND WINS THE ROLE OF THE RHINO IN THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2\n\nBack in March of 2011, Paul Giamatti went on Conan O’Brien’s show and joked about his love for the classic Spider-Man villain the Rhino, and how much he’d like to play him someday.  As Giamatti explains, the Rhino is a big guy in a rhino suit (complete with a horn on his head) whose super power is the ability to run at stuff really fast and knock it down (or through, or over, you get the point).  Strangely enough, he will actually get his wish, as this week, it was announced that Paul Giamatti is indeed in talks with Sony Pictures to play the Rhino in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The Rhino is the second confirmed villain for the sequel, after the previous news that Jamie Foxx will be playing Electro.  Felicity Jones (Like Crazy) was also cast this week in an unspecified role.  Although the Rhino is one of Spider-Man’s classic villains, it’s perhaps a testament to exactly how many rogues are in that gallery that the Rhino has never been considered by most to be a likely movie villain.  Among the Spider-Man villains that are still awaiting their movie debuts are Kraven the Hunter, Morbius, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Vulture.  One has to wonder if the Rhino didn’t get his slot in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 perhaps because of Paul Giamatti’s interest in playing him.  Chin up, Hammerhead, Hypno-Hustler, and the Molten Man, maybe you have movie star fans out there, too.  The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is scheduled for release on May 2, 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#2 ICEMAN, ROGUE, AND KITTY PRYDE TO RETURN FOR X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST\n\nSpeaking of superhero sequels scheduled for the summer of 2014, filming is scheduled to start soon on X-Men: Days of Future Past, which will use time travel to connect the first three X-Men movies with the prequel X-Men: First Class.  We already knew of several returning actors, including two Professor Xaviers (James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart), two Magnetos (Michael Fassbender and Sir Ian McKellen), a Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and a Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence).  This week, three of the characters from the “future” setting were also confirmed: Shawn Ashmore (Iceman), Rogue (Anna Paquin), and Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page).   The inclusion of Kitty Pryde is no huge surprise, as that character was quite central to the original “Days of Future Past” storyline from the comics.  Her return does however raise the question as to whether we will also see the return of Colossus, since he’s the love of her life and all.  Mark Millar also chimed in this week to confirm that this movie will finally see the mutant hunting robots the Sentinels on the big screen for something other than a cameo (in X-Men: The Last Stand).  And finally, casting calls in Montreal gave us another bit of info this week, as we now know that this sequel/prequel will be set in 1973, eleven years after the setting of X-Men: First Class.   20th Century Fox has scheduled X-Men: Days of Future Past for July 18, 2014, which is currently the same release date as The Hobbit: There and Back Again, the final film in that trilogy.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THE DOCTOR STRANGE MOVIE IS CONFIRMED AS PART OF MARVEL: PHASE THREE\n\nThere’s been talk about a Doctor Strange movie since the 1980s, but this week, we got official confirmation that it’s probably just a few years away.  Marvel bigwig Kevin Feige confirmed that when Ant-Man is released on November 6, 2015, that movie will be the start of Marvel’s “Phase 3.”  As a reminder, Marvel refers to their current crops of superhero movies as phases which have thus far ended each time with The Avengers (Phase 1), and in the future with The Avengers 2 (Phase 2).  That second bit of information had been presumed, but Feige’s comments this week confirm it.  But the real headline here is that the Doctor Strange movie will also be one of the Phase 3 movies.  Of course, we still don’t know who will be directing Doctor Strange, who will star as the Sorcerer Supreme, when it will exactly be released, or even a vague idea as to what it might be about.  But, you know… baby steps.\n\n\n\t\n#4 THE NEW TITLE OF DISNEY’S TOMORROWLAND REVEALS A BIT MORE OF THE MYSTERY… MAYBE\n\nWe’ve known for a while that director Brad Bird and screenwriter Damon Lindelof’s big tentpole blockbuster release for Disney next year (December 19, 2014) was purposefully being cloaked in mystery. Basically, all we know was that it was going to star George Clooney, and somehow involve a man who encounters something mysterious (probably in 1952, the movie’s previous title).   This week, Disney gave us a lot more to chew on in deciphering the mystery, as the title has now been changed to Tomorrowland, which is of course the name of one of Disney’s theme park areas.  This follows the revelation last week of images from the “box” that Damon Lindelof claims to have discovered (but he probably really didn’t) that inspired him to write this movie.  Included in the box appear to be images of such historical figures as Walt Disney (the man himself) and Amelia Earhart.  All of this early mystery also reminds us that Damon Lindelof was one of the showrunners of LOST.\n\n\n\t\n#5 THE ENTOURAGE MOVIE HAS BEEN GREENLIT\n\nAfter years of producer Mark Wahlberg talking it up, Warner Bros has finally given an official greenlight for the movie version of HBO’s Entourage, which came to an end in 2011.  Not much is really known about the movie yet, except that it will be set six months after the end of the series, and that deals are currently underway for all five of the series’ main stars to reprise their characters.  This news makes Entourage the second HBO series to get its own theatrical movie after Sex and the City.  Other HBO shows that have been mentioned (or rumored) as possibly getting movies in the past (but didn’t) included Rome, Deadwood, and The Sopranos.\n\n\t\n#6 FOR HIS NEXT DIRECTORIAL EFFORT, DENZEL WASHINGTON IS SWINGING FOR THE FENCES\n\nIn addition to his successful career as an actor, Denzel Washington has also directed two movies in the past (Antwone Fisher and The Great Debaters).  This week, Denzel Washington revealed that the next movie he hopes to direct will be an adaptation of the August Wilson stage play Fences, for which Washington won a Tony Award in 2010.  Washington will also be reprising his performance as the lead character, a trash collector in the 1950s who is haunted by his missed opportunity earlier in life of becoming a professional baseball player.  It’s not yet known if Viola Davis, who costarred with Washington on stage, will also sign on to play the same character in the movie version.\n\n\n#7 JEREMY RENNER TO STAR IN THE TRUE STORY DRAMA KILL THE MESSENGER\n\nHansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters may have done rather badly with the critics last week, but Hollywood isn’t holding that against Jeremy Renner. This week, Renner became attached to a true story drama called Kill the Messenger, based on the life of journalist Gary Webb.  The film will focus on the “Dark Alliance” stories that Gary Webb wrote in 1996 that claimed to have revealed a conspiracy between the CIA, the Contras in Nicaragua, and the “crack cocaine explosion” of the 1980s. Kill the Messenger will be directed by Michael Cuesta (L.I.E.) who is now probably most well known as the executive producer of the Showtime series Homeland, which paints a very different picture of the C.I.A. than Kill the Messenger is likely to.\n\n\t\n#8 THE JESSICA CHASTAIN OSCAR EXPRESS MIGHT JUST CONTINUE WITH MISS JULIE\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that Jessica Chastain was a complete unknown, but the last few years have seen her landing great role after great role.  Recently, Chastain pulled off the rare feat of having the lead role in both the #1 and the #2 movies on the box office chart (Mama and Zero Dark Thirty).  That being true, Jessica Chastain’s next role is unlikely to ever top the box office charts in the USA, although it does seem like it could attract year end award recognition, if it is indeed released later in 2013.  Chastain, Colin Farrell, and Samantha Morton have been cast in Miss Julie, an adaptation of the stage play by August Strindberg. Liv Ullman, director of 2000’s Faithless (and one of Ingmar Bergman’s favorite actresses) will direct the 1874-set story of a woman who starts having a relationship with one of her servants (Farrell).\n\n\n\t\n#9 TOM HARDY AND NOOMI RAPACE SIGN TO APPEAR IN SECOND MOVIE IN A ROW TOGETHER\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that we learned that Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises) and Noomi Rapace (Prometheus) are going to star together in an animal rights-centric movie called Animal Rescue.  This week, the two are now in negotiations to star in yet another movie together, in what will end up being a back-to-back series of films.  This time, the movie is Child 44, an adaptation of a novel by Tom Rob Smith about a member of the Soviet police in the 1950s who finds himself under government suspicion following his investigation of a series of child murders.   Child 44 will be directed by Daniel Espinoza (Safe House, Snabba Cash).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\nThis was apparently a good week…  No Rotten Ideas!\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Thanksgiving, tv, Hallmark, all-time, screen, show, Creative, Walt, Black, Competition","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Warcraft-Movie-Finds-New-Life"},{"id":"47509213425266","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Safe House Gets A Sequel","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Safe House Gets A Sequel\n                        Plus, new roles for Renee Zellweger, Michael Fassbender, Zac Efron, and Vin Diesel.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 7, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThe week after Labor Day was pretty much as slow for movie development news as the the week before the holiday was, except at least that one had 5 business days.  The articles for this week’s Ketchup had to be picked from a very limited pool, and probably about half of them never would have made the cut in most other weeks.  These ten stories include a sequel to a movie no one expected a sequel to, and new roles for Vin Diesel, Zac Efron, Chris Evans, Michael Fassbender, Bruce Willis, and Renee Zellweger.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWATCH OUT: SAFE HOUSE SURPRISINGLY SECURES A SEQUEL\nSafe House, released this past February by Universal Pictures, was something of a surprise solid hit, especially in the USA, where it earned $126 million of its $202.5 million worldwide gross.  That $202.5 million is a very respectable number, considering the film didn’t have many of the usual traits of a box office hit these days (super heroes, special effects, kid/teen friendly CGI, etc.).  $202.5 million is solid business, even if it’s not as big of a number as the worldwide box office results for say, Battleship, Wrath of the Titans, John Carter, Dark Shadows, or American Reunion (the movies currently at #16-#20 on the 2012 chart, above Safe House at #21).  What Safe House did have going for it was something quite old fashioned called “star power” in the form of Denzel Washington and (to a lesser degree) Ryan Reynolds.  The original Safe House was written by David Guggenheim while he was a staff writer at Us Weekly magazine, and now Guggenheim has been hired to write a sequel (that might actually be a prequel) as well.  Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington starred in the original Safe House as a young CIA agent and the rogue agent he has to keep in a Safe House in South Africa, respectively.  As of this week, there’s not yet any sequel/prequel deals for Reynolds or Washington.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 ROGER EBERT’S LIFE ITSELF TO INSPIRE A DOCUMENTARY MOVIE, COMPLETING A THEMATIC CIRCLE\n\nAlthough he was at one time considered just one half of a team with Chicago rival-turned-partner Gene Siskel, the last ten years has seen Roger Ebert really emerge as something of an elder spokesman within the film criticism community.  Ebert’s life also took an unexpectedly tragic yet inspiring turn when his battle with esophageal cancer led to the removal of much of his lower jaw.  His autobiography, Life Itself, was published last year, which included many personal memories of his life and career, in addition to such bittersweet remembrances as a chapter about the menu at his favorite fast food franchise Steak ‘n Shake.  It was probably inevitable that Ebert’s life become a movie, either sooner or later, and this week, we learned exactly how that will happen.  Documentary filmmaker Steve James (Hoop Dreams, Stevie), assisted by producers Martin Scorsese and Steven Zaillian, has optioned the rights to Life Itself as the basis of a documentary about Roger Ebert’s life.  Ebert was contacted by the IndieWire site for comment about the project, and it sounds like he was surprised by the project, and doesn’t know yet what the film will be like.   Meanwhile, in other documentary news, the trailer was debuted this week for A Liar’s Autobiography, an animated film from 17 different animation studios about the life of the late Monty Python member Graham Chapman.  In addition to Chapman’s own voice, the film also includes contributions from every other Python who isn’t Eric Idle.  Pythons who match that description include two Terrys (Jones and Gilliam), John Cleese and Michael Palin.  If a documentary is ever made about Eric Idle’s life, Graham Chapman is not expected to contribute.\n\n\n\t\n#2 BRUCE WILLIS MAY MENTOR AN AMERICAN ASSASSIN\n\nBruce Willis is now in talks with CBS Films to costar in American Assassin, an adaptation of one of the novels in the “Mitch Rapp” series by author Vince Flynn.  American Assassin is basically a prequel that explains how the fictional character of Mitch Rapp became one of the world’s most legendary CIA agents, with Bruce Willis in talks to play Rapp’s CIA agent mentor.  Jeffrey Nachmanoff (Traitor) is attached to direct from a script adapted by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, who previously worked together on Love and Other Drugs and The Last Samurai.   Once Bruce Willis is confirmed as the older CIA agent, CBS Films will get started on actually casting the lead actor who will potentially carry the role on through adaptations of other books in the series.\n\n\n\t\n#3 SIMON PEGG GAINS COSTARS IN BOTH THE WORLD’S END AND HECTOR…\n\nA few more actors joined two different movies starring Simon Pegg this week, and one of them will be in both films.  First up chronologically (filming-wise) will be The World’s End, which finishes up the “Three Flavors Cornetto” trilogy that began with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.  Paddy Considine (In America, The Bourne Ultimatum), who was also in Hot Fuzz, and Rosamund Pike (Wrath of the Titans, Die Another Day) will join Simon Pegg as 60% of the five friends reuniting for a pub crawl leading to the one called The World’s End.  After that film wraps up, Simon Pegg and Rosamund Pike will both continue on to the independent dramedy Hector and the Search for Happiness.  Simon Pegg will play an eccentric psychiatrist who sets out on a search to determine if happiness actually exists, with Rosamund Pike playing his girlfriend, and Christopher Plummer playing a “Happiness Studies” professor at UCLA.  Hector and the Search for Happiness will be directed by Peter Chelsom, whose previous comedies include Serendipity, Hannah Montana: The Movie, and the English language remake of Shall We Dance?  Normally, Chelsom’s RT Tomatometer scores would have landed that film in the Rotten Ideas, but it was saved by being lumped in with Edgar Wright’s The World’s End.\n\n\n\t\n#4 MICHAEL FASSBENDER AND BILL WEASLEY STAR IN THE PAPIER-MACHE-CENTRIC BIOPIC FRANK\n\nFor as many British musical acts dominated the U.S. charts as well in the 1980s, it might seem surprising to learn of the ones that were only famous in their homeland.  One such (novelty) act was Frank Sidebottom, who was actually a musician and comedian named Chris Sievey under a large papier mache head that vaguely resembled Pee Wee Herman (who debuted a few years before).  Frank Sidebottom went on to host his own TV show in the early 1990s, but eventually he faded from British pop culture significance.  And then, in 2010, Chris Sievey died from cancer at the age of 54, and it was discovered that he was penniless, which led to a large fundraising effort to at least give Frank Sidebottom a funeral.   It’s a sad story, and that’s probably why it’s being turned into a musical comedy biopic called Frank.   Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson, who is most famous for playing Bill Weasley in the last two Harry Potter movies will play Chris Sievey himself, and Michael Fassbender will play the leader of the eccentric rock band Sievey belonged to before becoming Frank Sidebottom.  Frank will be directed by Leonard Abrahamson of Ireland, whose first two films Adam &amp; Paul and Garage didn’t really make much of an impact in the USA.\n\n\n\t\n#5 RENEE ZELLWEGER MAKING HER DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH 4 1/2 MINUTES\n\nActress Renee Zellweger is set to add another hyphenate to her credits with her directorial debut on the independent drama (about comedy) called 4 1/2 Minutes.  Zellweger will also costar as the mother of a genius son for whom she hires a stand up comedian as sort of a male nanny, to be played by Johnny Knoxville.   The script was written by Anthony Tambakis (cowriter of Warrior), and was based at least partly on the life of comedian Dov Davidoff.  The movie will also be a look at the NYC stand up comedy community, and filming is scheduled to start there in February, 2013.\n\n\n\t\n#6 IS CAPTAIN AMERICA IN AN “ANTI-ROMANTIC COMEDY” A MANY SPLINTERED THING?\n\nChris Evans (The Avengers) and Michelle Monaghan (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Source Code) will star in an independent “anti-romantic comedy” called A Many Splintered Thing.  Director Justin Reardon will make his feature film debut working from a “Black List” screenplay by the team of Chris Shafer and Paul Vicknair.  The comedy is described as being in the style of Amelie or (500) Days of Summer, which is fine if one ignores the fact that those films have almost nothing in common, except perhaps for traits that the two leading ladies in those films might share.   Anyway, the story of A Many Splintered Thing involves a guy who starts a platonic relationship with an engaged woman that he met at a charity event while pretending to be a philanthropist.  Consider this one a borderline “Fresh Development” aided mostly by the Black List distinction, and the fact that the director and writers don’t have many other credits to help categorize this one.\n\n\n\t\n#7 ZAC EFRON HAS AN INDIE ROMANTIC COMEDY AS WELL CALLED ARE WE OFFICIALLY DATING?\n\nThis must have just been a good week for young heart throb type actors to sign on for independent romantic comedies, “anti” or no.  Zac Efron also signed on for one this past week called Are We Officially Dating?  The story from debut director Tom Gormican follows three friends in Manhattan who make a pact to remain single just as they each start to fall in love.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 VIN DIESEL WILL BE THE LAST WITCH HUNTER\n\nThis week saw the release of the first trailers for Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, which made it somewhat coincidental and/or timely that this news story also broke this week.  Vin Diesel is in talks with Lionsgate-Summit to star in a supernatural action movie called The Last Witch Hunter.  Breck Eisner (Sahara, The Crazies) is attached to direct The Last WItch Hunter from a script by Priest screenwriter Cory Goodman.   And that last part right there is why this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.  Anyway, The Last Witch Hunter is about, well, exactly what it sounds like… and it’s set in modern day New York City, which is the opposite of new and refreshing.\n\n\t\n#1 DISNEY IS JUMPING ON THE DYSTOPIAN BANDWAGON WITH MATCHED\n\nEverything old is new again thanks to the burgeoning YA novel market, and its target audience’s unawareness that much of what they’re reading has already been done before, and often, a lot better.  But alas, The Hunger Games and The Twilight Saga weren’t box office bombs, and so here we are.  Besides vampires and werewolves, these new books also often take place in dystopian futures and feature strong young female heroines.  One such book was 2010’s Matched by Ally Condie, which told the story of a girl in a dystopian future who rejects an arranged romance.  Walt Disney Pictures has the rights to that book, and the trilogy that it will eventually become the first book of.   This week, Disney chose director David Slade to direct Matched.  Slade’s previous two films were 30 Days of Night and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, both of which were rated “Rotten” on the RT Tomatometer, and so, here we are.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"HBO, Talk, Larson, review","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Safe-House-Gets-A-Sequel"},{"id":"47509213419119","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Len Wiseman Will Direct the Mummy Reboot","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Len Wiseman Will Direct the Mummy Reboot\n                        Plus, new roles for Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, and Gina Carano.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 28, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes movie development news for the video game adaptation Spy Hunter, a sort-of-kind-of prequel for The Passion of the Christ, a new version of The Mummy, and new roles for actresses Gina Carano, Dame Judi Dench, Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, and Hilary Swank.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nNEW GIGS FOR THE DIRECTORS OF ZOMBIELAND, MEN IN BLACK, AND UNDERWORLD\n\nIn picking the top movie development story for the week, it became something of a three way tie.  So we’re just going to cover all three stories in this cover story, under the theme of genre directors taking on big (potential) franchises.  First up is the long-in-development New Line Cinema adaptation of the 1983 arcade video game Spy Hunter, which has in the past been tackled (unsuccessfully) by directors like John Woo and Paul W. S. Anderson.  Spy Hunter is now a project for Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer, whose next film will be the recently delayed Gangster Squad.  Next up is the Warner Bros comic book adaptation Lore, which Dwayne Johnson was cast in a few months ago, at which time it was compared to being like Men in Black, but for mythological creatures.  Well, the comparison was solidified this week as Warner Bros is now in talks with Barry Sonnenfeld, the director of all three Men in Black movies.  Finally, there is the job of directing Universal Pictures’ newest reboot of The Mummy, one of their Universal Classic Monsters, which has gone to Len Wiseman, the man behind some of the Underworld movies, and most recently, the remake of Total Recall.  It should be noted that just because these three movies were collectively the top stories of the week, it doesn’t mean that in any other week they might not be Rotten Ideas.  Because they probably would be.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 ANNE HATHAWAY MIGHT STAR IN STEVEN SPIELBERG’S ROBOPOCALYPSE\n\nWith the ambitious biopic Lincoln still a month away from release, director Steven Spielberg is already casting up his adaptation of the Daniel H. Wilson sci-fi novel Robopocalypse, which looks to take Spielberg back to the eye candy that helped establish his career.  It’s been known for a while that Spielberg had cast Chris Hemsworth (AKA Thor) as the film’s lead, but this week, word of two other actors were added to the mix.  Although she is not yet officially signed, Anne Hathaway appears to be Spielberg’s choice for the female lead.  Another likely chosen actor is Ben Whishaw as a hacker named Lurker,  in a role that will be seen after Whishaw’s appearances in Cloud Atlas and in Skyfall as the new Q.   Finally, there’s a third addition to the film this week, but it’s a newsworthy producer, not a cast member.  Tom Rothman, who just last week announced his stepping down as the head of 20th Century Fox, will be joining Steven Spielberg as one of the producers of Robopocalypse.  Filming is expected to begin in early 2013, aiming for an April 25, 2014 release date via Disney’s Touchstone Pictures.\n\n\n\t\n#2 DAME JUDI DENCH AND THE QUEEN DIRECTOR UNITE FOR ADOPTION DRAMA PHILOMENA\n\nStephen Frears may hold the title for directing some of the best known and critically acclaimed movies without actually being known by name (in the USA, anyway) himself.  Frears’ filmography includes Dangeous Liaisons, The Grifters, High Fidelity, My Beautiful Laundrette, and The Queen.  Stephen Frears’ next film will be an adaptation of the non-fiction book by Martin Sixsmith, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, whose title will be shortened to Philomena.  The movie will tell the true story of an Irish teenager who gave birth to a son at a convent in 1952, with the baby eventually being “sold” for adoption to an anonymous family somewhere in the United States.  Dame Judi Dench will play Philomena searching for her son 50 years later, who is now a successful Washington, D.C. lawyer with AIDS, also searching for his mother before he dies.  Steve Coogan will costar as author Martin Sixsmith himself.  Filming will start in November, as a production of Pathe, BBC Films, and Coogan’s production company Baby Cow.\n\n\n\t\n#3 STREEP AND SWANK JOIN TOMMY LEE JONES IN THE HOMESMAN\n\nThe Homesman is the title of a historical drama to be adapted and directed by Tommy Lee Jones, from a novel by Glendon Swarthout.  This week, it was revealed that Meryl Streep and Hilary Swank are also attached to costar along with Tommy Lee Jones.  The 19th century drama tells the story of a pioneer couple (Jones and Swank) escorting three insane women across the American prairie (Streep is expected to play one of those women).   Tommy Lee Jones has directed a few different movies now, with his feature film debut being 2005’s The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.   The addition of Meryl Streep and Hilary Swank makes this one his highest profile film as director yet. That wasn’t the only Hilary Swank news this week, however. The actress is also set to star in a film called You’re Not You, based on a novel by Michelle Wildgen.  Swank will play a fatally ill woman who befriends her younger female caretaker (not yet cast).  It’s expected that Jeremy Renner will also costar as the older professor lover of the young caretaker.  You’re Not You will be the second feature film for director George C. Wolfe after 2008’s Nights in Rodanthe.\n\n\n\t\n#4 TOM HARDY JOINS THE MOUNTAIN CLIMBING BIOPIC EVEREST\n\nThis is another story of a successful director casting up his next movie before his previous film is released (and in this case, while that film is still filming).  Doug Liman (Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Bourne Identity) is currently filming the Tom Cruise sci-fi action movie All You Need is Kill, and his next film will be the mountain climbing biopic Everest, based on the Jeffrey Archer book Paths of Glory.  That book tells the true story of different men’s attempts in the 1920s to be the first to climb to the top of Mount Everest, the world’s tallest mountain.   Tom Hardy (AKA Bane in The Dark Knight Rises) has signed on to play George Mallory, the British climber that Archer’s book claims was successful before Sir Edmund Hillary (the answer that will actually score you a point on a school exam, especially in New Zealand).\n\n\n\t\n#5 HAYWIRE STAR GINA CARANO IS THE FIRST FEMALE EXPENDABLE (OR WHATEVER THEY’LL EVENTUALLY BE CALLED)\n\nEarlier this summer, one of the headlines involved the plans for a female version of The Expendables (which, to be clear, won’t be called that, because it’s not the same company).  This gave pretty much every movie news writer an opportunity to start listing all the classic female action stars they’d like to see in such a film (which usually started with Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton).  This week we learned that Haywire breakout star Gina Carano is the first actress to actually officially sign on for the movie, in what is probably closer to the Jason Statham-type role.\n\n\t\n#6 MARK MILLAR MAKES HIS MARK MANNING MARVEL (…AT FOX)\n\nOne of the most talked about trends in the last 10 years in comic books is the way that specific writers at both DC and Marvel have made huge creative impacts over each company’s characters.  Specifically, we’re thinking here of Grant Morrison and/or Geoff Johns at DC, and Brian Michael Bendis at Marvel (writer of almost every major Marvel arc from 2004 to 2009).  This idea of handing one man the keys to the kingdom has also started to expand to the movies, with Christopher Nolan acting as a “godfather” to WB’s Man of Steel, and Joss Whedon recently signing on to oversee Marvel Studio’s Phase II movies following the success of The Avengers.   This week, we learned that another major portion of the movie properties based on Marvel Comics, those whose rights belong to 20th Century Fox, are also now going to be similiarly shepherded.  In this case, the job will be going to Mark Millar, the Scottish writer best known for creating the comics that became the feature films Wanted and Kick-Ass.   The movie franchises at issue here are Fantastic Four and X-Men (with Daredevil and Elektra likely to revert back to Marvel soon).  Soon after the announcement, Mark Millar went online to talk (vaguely) about his own plans for these two seminal and popular comic book movie franchises.\n\n\n\t\n#7 IS JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE GOOD TO THE LAST DROP\n\nSinger-turned-actor Justin Timberlake has landed yet another role, this time in a romantic dramedy called The Last Drop.  Timberlake will play “a charming alcoholic working as a restaurant critic for New York Magazine who falls for a young woman and realizes he must overcome his addiction in order to have a relationship with her.”  The Last Drop was formerly listed on the Black List of Unproduced Screenplays, and was written by newcomers Brandon and Phil Murphy.  The Last Drop will be an independent production directed by Peter Sollett (Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist, Raising Victor Vargas).\n\n\n\t\n#8 SIR BEN KINGSLEY MAY PLAY KING HEROD IN THE SORT-OF PREQUEL TO THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST\n\nAlthough Mel Gibson is entirely uninvolved, Gibson’s cowriter on The Passion of the Christ has cowritten a film that is basically a prequel called Mary Mother of Christ, focusing on the time following Christ’s birth.  Benedict Fitzgerald also cowrote the 1979 John Huston film Wise Blood, and was joined as cowriter of Mary Mother of Christ by Barbara Nicolosi, a former nun.  Casting is currently underway, with Sir Ben Kingsley circling the central role of King Herod the Great, the man behind the Massacre of the Innocents that led up to Christ’s birth.  Mary herself will be played by Israeli actress Odeya Rush (The Odd Life of Timothy Green).  Peter O’Toole has been cast as Symeon, and Julia Ormond will play Mary’s cousin Elizabeth.  The producers are reportedly seeking Dame Judi Dench and Hugh Bonneville to play Anna the Prophetess and Satan, respectively. Mary Mother of Christ will be the second film for director Alister Grierson, who made his feature debut in 2011 with Sanctum, executive produced by James Cameron.  Mary Mother of Christ will be executive produced by Pastor Joel Osteen, and distributed by Lionsgate, most likely in 2014.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#1 NICOLAS CAGE TO STAR IN SOUTHLAND TALES DIRECTOR’S AMICUS\n\nThere was a time when writer/director Richard Kelly was considered to be one of the independent scene’s most promising new creatives.  Namely, that period was after Donnie Darko, and before… pretty much everything else (namely Southland Tales and The Box).  People, however, still get warm fuzzies when they hear the words Donnie Darko, and so Richard Kelly continues to be able to get financing for his new films.  The latest such project is called Amicus, and it will star Nicolas Cage as an attorney who helps a family filing a lawsuit against a Motown Records executive who hired a Detroit hitman to murder family members for the inheritance.  So, yeah, this movie has at least two elements that help make it the Rotten Idea in an otherwise inoffensive week.  I pointed out one, I’ll let you, the reader, figure out the other.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"2018, Arrangement, Mindy, Trailer, 99%, scary, mission:, and","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Len-Wiseman-Will-Direct-the-Mummy-Reboot"},{"id":"47509213421168","title":"Weekly Ketchup: SNL Alumnus to Write Looney Toons Reboot","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: SNL Alumnus to Write Looney Toons Reboot\n                        Also, Damon and Affleck reteam, and Baywatch and Manimal make some noise.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 21, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup is full of news stories concerning TV show adaptations like Looney Tunes (technically a TV show), Baywatch, and yes, Manimal.  There’s also a new movie for director Roman Polanski, new roles for Casey Affleck and Pierce Brosnan, and an unnecessary remake of The Flamingo Kid.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTHUFFERIN’ ****OTASH: SNL CAST MEMBER TO WRITE THE LOONEY TUNES REBOOT \n\nComedienne Jenny Slate is probably best known as the new member of the 2009-2010 season of Saturday Night Live who dropped the F-bomb in her first appearance (and wasn’t renewed for the 2010-2011 season).  Regardless of (and hopefully not because of) her R-rated past, Slate has been handed the reins to one of the most venerable and cherished kid-friendly stables of characters that anyone in Hollywood owns. Warner Bros wants to reboot the Looney Tunes characters as a live action/CGI hybrid film, and Jenny Slate has been hired to adapt the script.  Looney Tunes refers, of course, to the classic WB characters that include Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepe LePew, Porky Pig, Road Runner (and Wile E. Coyote), Speedy Gonzalez, Sylvester and Tweety, Tasmanian Devil, and Yosemite Sam.  This new attempt at a Looney Tunes reboot comes after another attempt at a reboot in 2003 in the form of Looney Tunes: Back in Action, which followed the 1996 hit Space Jam.  There’s no details yet as to what Jenny Slate’s take on Looney Tunes will actually be.  The reboot’s producers at Warner Bros include Seth Grahame-Smith, the writer of the recent Dark Shadows movie adaptation and author of mashup books like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 VENUS IN FUR:  ROMAN, ROMAN (POLANSKI), AWAITS YOU THERE\n\nThe subject comes up (nearly) every year with each new film from acclaimed director Roman Polanski, but given the nature of his new film, it might be apropos this time around.  In a nutshell, Roman Polanski was arrested in 1977 for charges involving a 13-year-old girl, but Polanski fled to France before he was sentenced, and has remained in Europe ever since.  This has led to an ongoing polarization among moviegoers in the 35 years ever since.  Polanski’s career before 1977 included classics like Chinatown and Rosemary’s Baby, and in the years since, he’s given the world such films as Death and the Maiden, The Pianist, The Ghost Writer, and most recently, Carnage.  Although most of his films have continued to be made in English, for his next project, Roman Polanski will be working in French on an adaptation of the Tony-nominated Broadway play Venus in Fur.  The comedic play is based upon a 1870 novel by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch about an erotic game of cat-and-mouse between a young playwright and one of the actresses auditioning for a role.  Filming will start this November in France, featuring Emannuelle Seigner (AKA Mrs. Roman Polanski since 1989, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) and Louis Garrel (The Dreamers).  Polanski’s next project after Venus in Fur is still expected to be D., the director’s adaptation of The Dreyfus Affair.\n\n\n\t\n#2 PIERCE BROSNAN LEADS THE SUICIDE-CENTRIC ENSEMBLE CAST OF A LONG WAY DOWN\n\nNick Hornby is a successful British author and writer whose books have been adapted as four movies: High Fidelity, About a Boy, and two different (British and American) versions of Fever Pitch.  That’s especially impressive when one considers that Hornby has only written six proper novels.  Hornby is about to hit a 50% adaptation rate (Fever Pitch was non fiction) with a new film based on his novel A Long Way Down, about four strangers who meet on top of a London skyscraper as they’re about to commit suicide, leading them to form a pact to stay alive until at least Valentine’s Day.  Pierce Brosnan, Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense), Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad), and Imogen Poots (28 Weeks Later) will respectively play a former TV celebrity, a single mother, a failed musician, and a teenager.  Filming has already started in London under the direction of Pascal Chaumeil (2010’s Heartbreaker), who was also Luc Besson’s assistant director on such films as Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element, and The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc.  The script was adapted by Jack Thorpe, a British TV writer whose credits include several episodes of Skins (UK) and This is England (’86 and ’88).\n\n\n\t\n#3 AFFLECK AND DAMON, BACK TOGETHER AGAIN, FOR THE RACE TO THE SOUTH POLE\n\nMany movie fans probably still think of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as the best friend wunderkind duo that won their Oscars for Good Will Hunting.  However, the reality is that Affleck and Damon haven’t produced a movie together since Feast, the 2005 horror film that was the result of the last season of HBO’s Project Greenlight.  Their production company Pearl Street, however, has still been developing movies, such as a planned Whitey Bulger biopic that Affleck would direct and Damon would star in as Bulger.  Another project got added this week to the list of potential Affleck/Damon reunions in the form of Race to the South Pole, about the true story of two early 1900s explorers who competed against each other to reach the world’s last uncharted land territory.  Ben’s brother Casey Affleck is attached to costar as English explorer Robert Falcon Scott, and the other main character is Norwegian Roald Amundsen.   Race to the South Pole was written by Peter Glanz, who made his writing/directing debut with the recent independent film The Longest Week, starring Olivia Wilde, Jason Bateman, Billy Crudup, and Jenny Slate (see above).  There has been speculation that either Ben Affleck or Matt Damon might play Roald Amundsen, but neither possibility has been confirmed as of yet.\n\n\n\t\n#4 SUPER DIRECTOR CONFIRMED FOR MARVEL’S GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY\n\nAlthough it’s been rumored and almost expected since August, but it was this week that director James Gunn (Super, Slither, The Specials) confirmed that he will indeed be directing Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy.  This film, based on the most recent version of the team (which has led to a lot of confusion from people who just use Wikipedia instead of actual comic book knowledge), is scheduled by Disney and Marvel for August 1, 2014, making it the fourth upcoming Marvel film after Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier.  Guardians of the Galaxy is also expected to be the film that really takes the Marvel Universe into space (not counting the Thor movies), and it will  be the last bridge film leading into The Avengers 2.  The Guardians of the Galaxy as they will appear in this film will be Drax the Destroyer (a deceased human turned into a huge green space warrior), Gamora (an alien former agent of the villain Thanos), StarLord (a human intergalactic cop not at all to be confused with Green Lantern), Groot (a tree who just says his own name), and Rocket Raccoon (who is pretty much exactly what his name sounds like).  Although there are a few Rotten films on James Gunn’s RT Tomatometer, the film that reportedly demonstrates what Marvel liked about Gunn for Guardians of the Galaxy was the sci-fi comedy Slither, which earned an 85% Fresh rating.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#5 THE END OF AN ERA: TOM ROTHMAN RESIGNS FROM 20TH CENTURY FOX\n\nUsually, this column addresses specific new movies that have been announced as being in development, mostly at major movie studios.  Sometimes, a news story might include as many as a handful of movie properties.  This story, however, doesn’t do any of that, and yet, it addresses someone whose influence has directly impacted the movies that we all have enjoyed since before this writer got started back in 1997.  Tom Rothman has announced his retirement as CEO and Co-Chairman of 20th Century Fox, effective on January 1, 2013.  During Rothman’s 18 years at Fox, he was responsible for greenlighting and shepherding some of the best popcorn-munching-inducing movies that we have had the pleasure of seeing (Titanic, for example).  There was also a period when Rothman became something of an easy target for resentful fanboys, especially after the failures of such Marvel movie properties as Daredevil and Fantastic Four.  Things had been starting to change for the better in recent years, it seemed, however.  Avatar, X-Men: First Class, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes were all 20th Century Fox films that Rothman surely had a hand in bringing to us. There will probably be much more written, maybe whole books, about Tom Rothman’s years at 20th Century Fox.  For now, let’s just say that it seems like a “Rotten Idea” for Rothman to be stepping down (however that’s happening, for whatever reason), just now that 20th Century Fox seems to be heading in the right direction.\n\n\n\t\n#4 VANESSA HUDGENS AND ASHLEY TISDALE GET ANIMATED FOR THE GREAT MIGRATION\n\nThe Great Migration is the name of an upcoming animated musical that is being cast almost entirely with young stars with roots in kid-friendly cable networks and programs.  Specifically, the cast will include Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale (both from Disney’s High School Musical), Logan Henderson and Kendall Schmidt (both from Nickelodeon’s Big Time Rush), and Ashley Benson (Pretty Little Liars).  What is not so specific is what exactly The Great Migration is about (though one would have to first guess birds based on the title).  The logline that is out there right now just says, that it’s about “a group of characters that encounter a mutated predator threatening to destroy the balance of their environment.”  Of course, that can also describe the premise of LOST. The Great Migration was written by former child star Kevin G. Schmidt (Cheaper by the Dozen, The Butterfly Effect), but it’s unclear based on the initial reports exactly who will be directing.  Rob Minkoff (The Lion King, The Forbidden Kingdom) is one of the producers behind CMI Entertainment, the production company behind this independent animated production.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THE BAYWATCH MOVIE GETS HELP FROM THE RENO 911 POLICE DEPARTMENT\n\nParamount Pictures is still planning on bringing back the red swimsuits of Baywatch through a new theatrical movie, which has been known for a while to be more intentionally comedic than the original 1989-1999 TV series.  It’s been known for a while that the screenwriter working on the Baywatch movie is Peter Tolan (cowriter of Analyze This, Just Like Heaven), with comparisons being made to Stripes.  Baywatch doesn’t seem to have much in common with Stripes, but Stripes is generally considered a great comedy, and savvy Hollywood types know that one of the secrets to success is comparing yourself to good movies.  The comparison might also have come up because Ivan Reitman directed Stripes, and he’s also one of the Baywatch movie’s producers.  Anyway, the news this week is that a) Paramount still wants to make a Baywatch movie, and b) the director that they’ve recruited is Robert Ben Garant, the former member of The State who cocreated Reno 911!, directed Reno 911: Miami, and has with Tom Lennon cowritten the Night at the Museum movies.  What’s “rotten” about this story isn’t so much Mr. Garant’s body of work itself, but just that first part: Paramount still wants to make a Baywatch movie.\n\n\n\t\n#2 MANIMAL IS YET ANOTHER 1980S TV SHOW THAT MIGHT BECOME AN ACTUAL BIG SCREEN MOVIE \n\nNostalgia is a powerful, nigh-unquenchable force.  There was a time when nostalgia for the 1960s was the big thing in Hollywood, but the 1970s got only a portion of that.  When it came time for people to start reflecting all misty-eyed for the 1980s (which was really quite a while ago now), however, Hollywood types latched onto to the Reagan years, and they still haven’t given up.  Nostalgic movie projects can take a few different forms (remakes, reboots, cartoon adaptations, etc), so that means there’s actually way more sources to adapt that there will ever (hopefully) actually be produced movies based on those properties.  That, at least, is probably why it’s taken this long for someone like Sony Pictures Animation to get around to announcing plans for a Manimal movie.   Manimal was of course a short lived NBC detective show starring the late Simon MacCorkindale as a shapeshifter who uses his abilities to solve crimes.  The show wasn’t that great, but even so, it was still ahead of its time.  If Manimal had been made twenty years later, even if it was just “meh,” it probably could have gotten closer to 8 seasons instead of just 8 episodes.  Anyway, the plan is for Sony Pictures Animation to produce Manimal as a live action/CGI combination, which probably just means that the CGI will be used for the various animals, which is probably a lot easier than working with real panthers and such.  To close, this is where this article should point out that Sony Pictures Animation was the studio behind The Smurfs, and they’re also developing a CGI/live action adaptation of another 1980s NBC TV show, ALF.\n\n\n\t\n#1 THIS WEEK IN UNNECESSARY REMAKES: THE FLAMINGO KID\n\nIt’s rather easy and fun to joke about Hollywood’s attempts to remake or adapt corny properties like, say, Baywatch or Manimal.  One of the core rules of remakes and adaptations, however, is that it’s often easier to make a good film from “meh” material, because the standard starts out so low, you can only go up (maybe).  The reason for that rule is that the opposite is usually also seen as true: trying to remake a film that was great the first time is usually a losing proposition.   One movie that was quite good the first time was 1984’s The Flamingo Kid, which starred Matt Dillon as a young guy working at a Long Island beach resort in the 1960s.  The Flamingo Kid was directed by Garry Marshall back before he retreated into Julia Roberts romantic comedies.  The movie works, which is probably why it has an 88% Fresh rating on the RT Tomatometer.  Anyway, despite all of that, Walt Disney Pictures and producer Brett Ratner are teaming up on a remake of The Flamingo Kid.  It will be adapted by Nzingha Stewart, who coproduced For Colored Girls with Tyler Perry, and has directed music videos for Jay Z and 50 Cent.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Prime","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-SNL-Alumnus-to-Write-Looney-Toons-Reboot"},{"id":"47509213428339","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Metal Gear Solid Movie On Its Way?","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Metal Gear Solid Movie On Its Way?\n                        Plus, new roles for Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, Ryan Gosling, and a boy raised by whales.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 31, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nIn this week leading up to the Labor Day weekend (and the de facto end of the 2012 summer season), the Hollywood movie development news cycle went into one of its slower periods.  Where normally there might be 20 to 35 major news stories that are considered for inclusion in the Weekly Ketchup, this week, there were basically just ten, and they all are included below.  Making the grade this week are news stories for such stars as Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Douglas, Ryan Gosling, and Prometheus stars Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWATCH OUT: METAL GEAR SOLID IS TRYING TO STEALTHILY SNEAK ITS WAY INTO MOVIE THEATERS\n\nBox office and critical success continues to elude video game adaptations, as a film form, in a way that hasn’t been a problem for comic book adaptations now, by and large, for well over ten years.  The man who was central to Marvel’s success in those early years, in the time of films such as Spider-Man and X-Men, was Avi Arad.  And now, those two jigsaw pieces have come together in the form of Konami’s announcement that Avi Arad has come aboard to produce the long-in-development Metal Gear Solid movie.  Metal Gear Solid was of course one of the most popular games for the original Sony PlayStation upon its release in 1998, leading to a franchise of Metal Gear games that has collectively sold over 30 million copies worldwide.  Central to almost all Metal Gear games is the concept of stealth, as the main character is usually master spy and saboteur Solid Snake (voiced in English by X-Men writer David Hayter, by the way).  It’s also worth noting that this reinvigorated development of a potential Metal Gear Solid movie comes not that long after the news earlier this summer of Michael Fassbender producing and starring in another stealth-based videogame adaptation, Assassin’s Creed.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 MICHAEL FASSBENDER’S WHOLE WORLD HAS COME UNDONE, NOW THAT JANE GOT A GUN\n\nMichael Fassbender is in talks to costar with Natalie Portman (who is also producing) in an independent cowboy western called Jane Got a Gun.  Natalie Portman will be playing “a woman married to an outlaw who returns home bullet-riddled and half dead, betrayed by criminal confederates hot on his heels.”  Michael Fassbender would play “the ex-lover [Portman’s character] seeks out to help her defend her farm from the imminent onslaught of black hats” (presumably with bad guys underneath them).   The $20 million independent production has already attracted a director well familiar with indie budgeting in the form of Lynne Ramsay (Morvern Callar, We Need to Talk About Kevin), working from a script by newcomer Brian Duffield which was included in last year’s Black List of Unproduced Screenplays.\n\n\n\t\n#2 CHARLIZE THERON MIGHT WEAR THE EYEPATCH OF A WAR JOURNALIST\n\nThere’s a very elite little club whose members include Ziggy Stardust, Molotov Cocktease (The Venture Bros), and Nadine Hurley (Twin Peaks).  Figure out the connection yet?  All of them were redheads with eye patches.  Until recently, journalist Marie Colvin also fit those descriptions (almost; her hair was more auburn), except unlike them, Colvin was actually a real person.  Perhaps dwelling on her personal appearance is a way of tiptoeing around the sadder reality, which is that in February, 2012, Colvin was killed by an IED (improvised explosive device) while covering the civil war in Homs, Syria.  Colvin died the way she lived, which included covering dangerous war zones in such places as Chechnya, East Timor, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, and Zimbabwe.  And now, we finally get to the movie development part of this story.  Charlize Theron and producer Basil Iwanyk (The Town, We Are Marshall) have optioned the film rights to the Vanity Fair article, “Marie Colvin’s Private War.”  That piece by Marie Brenner specifically told the story of how Colvin smuggled herself and (also now deceased) photojournalist Remi Ochlik into Syria to cover the civil war.  Charlize Theron’s interest as producer may also (and presumably will) include her playing Marie Colvin herself, but Theron isn’t technically attached as the possible film’s star, yet.  One possible obstacle is that Charlize Theron (37) is nearly 20 years younger than Marie Colvin was when she went to Syria (56).  Of course, if she does star in this film, it also wouldn’t be the first time Theron has changed her appearance for a film (Monster, North Country, etc).\n\n\n\t\n#3 RYAN GOSLING KNOWS HOW TO CATCH A MONSTER (BUT DOES HE KNOW HOW TO DIRECT?)\n\nThe first thing this writer thought of when he heard the taglines for this story (noir fantasy with a female protagonist) was the 2011 Zack Snyder-directed flop Sucker Punch.  That may be why this story’s logline is quick to also include “modern day.”  The bigger part of the headline also involves the director, which is former MMC member Ryan Gosling, making his directorial and screenwriting debuts.  The independent film in question is entitled How to Catch a Monster, and it will feature Christina Hendricks (who also costarred with Gosling in Drive) as a single mother who finds “a road leading to an underwater town.”  Filming is expected to start sometime in the spring of 2013.\n\n\t\n#4 MICHAEL DOUGLAS FOLLOWS LIBERACE WITH RONALD REAGAN IN REYKJAVIK\n\nFor most of his career, Michael Douglas was never one of those actors who particularly specialized in playing real life characters, or historical figures (unless I’m forgetting a film, which I’m sure commenters will point out).  However, now that Douglas is approaching his 70s, he appears to be changing that profile, either deliberately or coincidentally.  Douglas is currently filming the Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra for HBO and director Steven Soderbergh.  That will be followed by the Hangover-with-old-guys comedy Last Vegas, and then likely after that, Michael Douglas will be returning with another very famous celebrity portrayal.  Douglas has signed on to star as President Ronald Reagan in Reykjavik, a drama about the 1986 peace summit in Iceland between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev (who hasn’t been cast yet).  Ridley Scott had previously been attached to direct Reykjavik, but he has since dropped out (probably due to Scott’s always full slate of film projects).  Instead, Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) will be directing Reykjavic from a script by Kevin Hood (Becoming Jane).  Filming is scheduled to start in March, 2013 on location in Germany, which will be standing in for Reykjavic and elsewhere in Iceland.  To close, I guess this piece shows that one really can write about Mikhail Gorbachev without mentioning that thing on his head.  Oh, wait…\n\n\n\t\n#5 PAUL RUDD AND ZACH GALIFIANAKIS TO STAR IN THE ANGELIC COMEDY WILL\n\nIt’s pretty much an annual ritual that the director of the previous Best Picture Oscar winner will be hotly pursued by Hollywood in the following months.  This year, the winner of that distinction is Michel Hazanavicius (The Artist), but in his case, he’s not necessarily traditional, mostly because he’s A) a comedy director and B) you know… French.  Paramount Pictures, however, does have a long-brewing comedy project that Hazanavicius is interested in, complete with two comedy stars attached.  If and when it actually gets made, Paul Rudd will star in the comedy Will, set in an imaginary world “devoid of free will where every action is written by angelic scribes,” with Zach Galifianakis set to play Rudd’s angelic writer.  The scenario basically sounds a bit like the Ricky Gervais comedy The Invention of Lying because the rest of the logline is that Galifianakis’ character “quits” his job, allowing Rudd’s character to do whatever he wants (which could also be seen as sort of like Bruce Almighty).  As noted before, Will has been around for a while, with both Will Ferrell and the Little Miss Sunshine directors Valerie Ferris and Jonathan Dayton previously attached.  As for who actually wrote this hotly sought after comedy script, Will was written by Demetri Martin, formerly of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Important Things with Demetri Martin, and most recently, for an unexpected dramatic supporting role in Contagion.  The world will have to wait a little bit longer for Will, however, as Michel Hazanavicius is expected to next direct a remake of the 1958 film The Search.\n\n\n\t\n#6 DICAPRIO, MAGUIRE AND HARDY UNITE TO TAKE ON THE MODERN POACHING TRADE\n\nAnimal rights activist Leonardo DiCaprio is teaming up with his longtime friend Tobey Maguire and his Inception costar Tom Hardy to jointly produce an untitled drama about poaching and animal products trafficking in the political ensemble style of Traffic.  The project is being set up at Warner Bros, where DiCaprio has a history as both a star and producer, and a writer is currently being sought.  Although all three actors are producing, there’s no word yet as to whether all (or any) of them will actually costar in the eventual project.  This film idea started with Tom Hardy, who was “inspired by friends who are former Special Forces operatives and went on to become anti-poaching fighters in South Africa and other nations.”  Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire will also be seen acting together in next summer’s The Great Gatsby, also being distributed by Warner Bros.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 CAN MICHAEL KEATON JOINING THE CAST OF THE ROBOCOP REMAKE TURN AROUND PUBLIC PERCEPTION?\n\nMGM’s 2013 remake of the 1980s science fiction/satire classic RoboCop has gone through something of a rollercoaster ride of online fan reactions.  There had been much good will rewarded to the remake with the casting of such actors as Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson, Jackie Earle Haley, Michael K. Williams, and Hugh Laurie.  Then, however, a scathing script review made its way online, and over night, you could tangibly feel millions of RoboCop fans recoil.  This was followed by the news that Hugh Laurie (House MD) had dropped out of negotiations to play the remake’s villain.  The search for Laurie’s replacement didn’t last long, however, as we now know that the role has been landed by Michael Keaton, who is himself not unfamiliar to fans of 1980s genre films, in particular.  Keaton has seemed to be somewhat missing in action in recent years; although he’s technically still been getting work, it has, with the exception of a supporting role in The Other Guys, mostly been voice work (such as Ken in various Toy Story projects).  This particular news story is definitely borderline.  The film itself may indeed be a “Rotten Idea” and a train wreck, but if director Jose Padilha can make it work, this might also mean a comeback of sorts for Michael Keaton.  That is, of course, if MGM allows Padilha to “make it work.”\n\n\n\t\n#2 TRANSFORMERS SCREENWRITERS TAKE ON COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GIANT BEASTS WITH DRAGONOLOGY\n\nThe late 2000s was a period during which it seemed like nearly every week saw another children’s book series being picked up for film rights by a Hollywood studio.  In 2008, such was the case for Universal Pictures and the Dragonology series, which is written by various authors under the joint pen name of Ernest Drake, writing from the perspective of a Victorian Era world in which dragons actually exist.  Now, four years later, Universal Pictures is hoping to revive their Dragonology adaptation by bringing aboard as producers the writing team of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci.  Kurtzman and Orci have frequently worked together as producers in the past (such as TV’s Fringe), but they are best known as a screenwriting team responsible for such films as Cowboys &amp; Aliens, the first two Transformers movies, and more positively, the reboot of Star Trek.  It is because Star Trek and Mission: Impossible III are the only spots of red in a filmography of green splotches on their RT Tomatometer page that Dragonology is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.\n\n\n\t\n#1 BEACHED IS THE STORY OF A BOY RAISED BY WHALES. SERIOUSLY.\n\nHollywood has of late become so fascinated with the hot art of the remake that they have become the dominant story type each week in this “Rotten Ideas” space.  As a result, it’s been a while since there was a movie news story that earned its place here just because it was truly a ridiculous story idea, period.  Which brings us to a Fox property called Beached, which director Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings, National Treasure) is now attached to helm.  Here’s pretty much all that you need to know, in a tidy logline from The Hollywood Reporter: “Beached centers on a chubby 4-year-old child who falls overboard during a family outing, is raised by whales and goes on to become an Olympic swimmer.”  It’s rare enough nowadays that a premise dares to be so completely nonsensical that this one is almost refreshing in its “Who needs logic?” mental gymnastics.  I was going to fill this article with questions about how-exactly-does-that-work, but I think I’ll leave them to the commenters down below to point out.   Beached got its start as a script by screenwriter Ted Griffin (cowriter of Tower Heist, Matchstick Men), and the most recent draft was by Jordan Roberts (March of the Penguins).\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Box, Baby, Chernobyl, RT21","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Metal-Gear-Solid-Movie-On-Its-Way"},{"id":"47509216191112","title":"Weekly Ketchup: The Mummy Gets Another Reboot","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: The Mummy Gets Another Reboot\n                        Plus, biopics for Grace Kelly, Hank Aaron, and Pam Grier.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 6, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis Week’s Ketchup was carefully compiled for you, as Greg Dean Schmitz had to sort through dozens of stories that were posted over the weekend in attempts to trick movie fans into believing various flights of April Fools fancy.  Stories that came out this week that actually are real include reboots of The Mummy and Summer School, movies based on the lives of actresses Grace Kelly and Pam Grier, baseball great Hank Aaron, and Apple founder Steve Jobs, and sequels for Captain America, The Hunger Games and The Woman in Black.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nUNIVERSAL PICTURES REBOOTING THE MUMMY… AGAIN\n\nIt was just thirteen years ago next month that Universal Pictures bombastically rebooted one of their classic monster properties as The Mummy, starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and millions of CGI grains of sand.   That film led to two sequels and a spin off series for The Scorpion King.  Rather than continue the franchise with a fourth film, Universal Pictures is now developing a new reboot of The Mummy.  Screenwriter Jon Spaihts has been hired to bring the franchise back to its roots in the “dark, scary source material, and simultaneously open it up to an epic scale we haven’t seen before.”  Jon Spaihts’ previous film credit is another movie with lots of swirling CGI bits, last year’s The Darkest Hour.  Jon Spaihts was also the original writer of Ridley Scott’s Prometheus before Damon Lindelof (LOST) came aboard for rewrites.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 CAPTAIN AMERICA, THE SECOND MOVIE, IS ALMOST EXACTLY TWO YEARS AWAY \n\nIt’s been known for a while that Disney and Marvel Studios had slotted two mystery projects for release dates on April 4th and May 16th in 2014.  This week, the two studios revealed, almost to the day two years ahead, that it will be the Captain America sequel that will be released on April 4th, 2014.  Although few other details are known yet, the sequel is known to be continuing the story following The Avengers, as Captain America (Chris Evans) continues to acclimate to living in the 21st century and find his role in our modern world.  Just last week, a short list was revealed of directors that Marvel is currently considering for the Captain America sequel.  That list includes F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job, Law Abiding Citizen), George Nolfi (The Adjustment Bureau) and Community creators Joe and Anthony Russo (You, Me and Dupree).   As for what the second Marvel release might be in 2014, strong possibilities include Ant-Man, Doctor Strange and (perhaps most likely) The Avengers 2.\n\n\n\t\n#2 HANK AARON GETS A BIOPIC AND THE NATURAL CHOICE FOR DIRECTOR\n\nThe critical and box office success last year of Moneyball has some pundits and producers wondering if there’s a new and growing movie audience for true baseball stories.   One project that is currently in the works is 42, about the relationship between Jackie Robinson and Brooklyn Dodgers GM Branch Rickey (to be played by Harrison Ford).  This week, Jackie Robinson got some competition as Hank Aaron (who’s still alive and kicking at the age of 78, by the way) has sold his life rights in a deal that includes the Howard Bryant book The Last Hero: The Life Story of Henry Aaron.   The deal was orchestrated in part by producer Mike Tollin, whose past films include the sports movies Hardball, Varsity Blues and Coach Carter.   Tollin isn’t the only one with baseball movie experience, as the director that has been hired for the Hank Aaron biopic is none other than Barry Levinson, who in addition to directing Rain Man and Good Morning Vietnam also gave the world one of the most iconic baseball movies ever, The Natural.   The as-yet-untitled Hank Aaron biopic is expected to especially focus on Aaron’s pursuit of Babe Ruth’s home run record during his years with the Atlanta Braves.\n\n\n\t\n#3 DANIEL RADCLIFFE MAY GET A NEW FRANCHISE WITH THE WOMAN IN BLACK: ANGELS OF DEATH\n\nThe question of whether Daniel Radcliffe could have a successful post-Harry Potter film career seemed to be at least partially answered earlier this year with The Woman in Black.  That film has earned over $120 million worldwide, making it the most successful British horror film of the last 20 years.  Because of that, Hammer Films is now moving ahead with plans for a sequel called The Woman in Black: Angels of Death, which will move the ghost story ahead 40 years, as a new couple encounters the haunted Eel Marsh House in the 1940s.  The sequel is being written by Jon Croker, a newcomer who worked as story editor on the first film, and also as a production assistant on the third and fourth Harry Potter movies.  It’s not yet known if director James Watkins will return for the sequel, or to what extent (if any) Daniel Radcliffe will be involved with the sequel.\n\n\n\t\n#4 NICOLE KIDMAN TO PLAY HOLLYWOOD ROYALTY AS GRACE OF MONACO\n\nAfter a competitive casting process, Nicole Kidman has come out on top to star as actress-turned-royalty Grace Kelly in Grace of Monaco.  The script by newcomer Arash Amel scored very well on the Black List of Unproduced Screenplays, and it will be directed by Olivier Dahan (La Vie en Rose, Crimson Rivers 2: Angels of the Apocalypse).  Rather than a full biopic, like several other recent films (The King’s Speech, The Queen, The Iron Lady, etc), Grace of Monaco will focus on a specific period from 1961 to 1962 during which Princess Grace worked as a diplomat with Prince Rainier III to defend the sovereignty of Monaco.\n\n\n\t\n#5 PAM GRIER GETS HER OWN FOXY BIOPIC TOO\n\nTwo actresses probably couldn’t have been more different, but Grace Kelly and Pam Grier now have something in common. Imprint Entertainment, one of the production companies behind two of the Twilight movies and also Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, has secured the film rights to Pam Grier’s autobiography Foxy: My Life in Three Acts.   Pam Grier is of course an actress hailed by some (like Quentin Tarantino) as the first female action star, with her filmography including such early films as Coffy and Foxy Brown, and her later career has included Jackie Brown, Escape from L.A., Ghosts of Mars and a regular role on the Showtime series The L Word.  Imprint Entertainment has hired TV writer and producer Eunetta Boone (My Wife and Kids, One on One) to adapt Grier’s story, which for this film is expected to especially focus on her early career in the 1970s and personal experiences that included relationships with Richard Pryor and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\n\n\t\n#6 THIS WEEK IN HUNGER GAMES SEQUEL NEWS\n\nFor obvious reasons, Lionsgate is working diligently to get production started quickly on Catching Fire, their adaptation of the second novel in the Suzanne Collins trilogy that started with The Hunger Games.  This week, there were two different news stories related to Catching Fire, one helping the adaptation move forward, and the other possibly slowing things down a bit.  First, the good news:  20th Century Fox has scheduled filming of the sequel to X-Men: First Class for a start in January, 2013 with an eye towards allowing Jennifer Lawrence to film Catching Fire this fall, first.  This is obviously also good news for fans of that movie, who are looking forward to more retro back story with Charles Xavier and his mutant students.  The not-as-great news is that director Gary Ross (Pleasantville, Seabiscuit) will not be returning for the sequel after obviously being a big part of what made the first novel’s adaptation successful both as a movie and an adaptation of Collins’ novel.  We can also now expect to be deluged with stories in the coming weeks as Lionsgate begins to consider who will take over the directing reins for Catching Fire.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 KATY PERRY MAKES HER LIVE ACTION DEBUT PLAYING… HERSELF IN KATY PERRY: PART OF ME\n\nAlthough she did voice Smurfette last year in The Smurfs, pop singer Katy Perry has not yet had a role in a live action movie, but that will change this summer… sort of.  In a somewhat last minute announcement (just 3 months ahead), it was learned this week that Paramount Insurge and Imagine Entertainment will be releasing the 3D musical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me in theaters on July 5th, 2012.  The behind-the-scenes concert movie is being described as “the first ever big-screen look at the international superstar’s life both on- and off-stage.”\n\n\t\n#2 ASHTON KUTCHER LANDS THE INEVITABLE STEVE JOBS BIOPIC\n\nEvery year on the last day of March, movie fans and reporters alike get ready to disbelieve pretty much everything that is soon to appear online.  It happens almost every year, however, that one of the incredible sounding news stories that appears online on April 1st actually turns out to be legit.  The news that Joss Whedon would be directing The Avengers was actually one relatively recent example of that.  This year, that distinction most likely goes to the revelation that Steve Jobs lookalike Ashton Kutcher has actually been cast as the Apple founder in an independent biopic called Jobs.   It’s important to note, however, that Jobs is not the biopic that was much publicized last year after Jobs’ passing, which is still in development at Sony Pictures, and is based upon Walter Isaacson’s authorized Steve Jobs biography.  Instead, Jobs was written by newcomer Matt Whiteley and will be directed by Joshua Michael Stern (Swing Vote, Neverwas).  It’s Stern’s RT Tomatometer scores that land Jobs a spot as one of this week’s Rotten Ideas.\n\n\n\t\n#1 ADAM SANDLER AND HAPPY MADISON REMAKING SUMMER SCHOOL\n\nHollywood is full on in love with remaking, rebooting and sequelizing the 1980s; that much cannot be disputed.  A sign that such a trend is deeply entrenched is when the movies that are getting rebooted and remade aren’t just the obvious successes and cultural milestones, but also include less remembered or cherished properties.  The 1987 Mark Harmon comedy Summer School is arguably in that category.  Although Summer School did have the distinction of being directed by Carl Reiner (The Jerk, All of Me, The Man with Two Brains — he really liked working with Steve Martin), it’s often forgotten when writers or fans look back on the teen comedies of the 1980s.   And that’s too bad, because as the film’s 61% RT Tomatometer score shows, it’s actually a pretty good little comedy, with Mark Harmon playing a gym teacher forced to babysit a group of varied underachiever students during the summer.  Anyway, Paramount has wanted to remake Summer School for several years now, and this week, the project got new life.   Adam Sandler’s Happy Madison production company is now attached to shepherd the remake through development.   The next step is to find a new writer to tackle the remake, which Adam Sandler isn’t (currently) expected to star in.  One movie that Sandler will definitely be in however is Grown Ups 2, which will be his first sequel.  Sandler’s friends Chris Rock, Kevin James and David Spade are all also expected to return, and this week brought news of the first new cast member for Grown Ups 2.  Taylor Lautner, best known for his work as a teen actor in movies like The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3D has signed on for an unspecified role in Grown Ups 2, which is just described as being “fun” and that he goes “toe to toe” with Sandler’s character.  Or as might be better said for a new role for the Sharkboy kid… “fin to toe.”\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a u=513376″>RT forum message.\n                                            \n                \n            \n                \n                \n\n\n\n     ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Animation, new, children's, batman","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-The-Mummy-Gets-Another-Reboot"},{"id":"47509214934660","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise Signed to Van Helsing Reboot","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise Signed to Van Helsing Reboot\n                        Plus, new versions of Little Shop of Horrors, The Jungle Book, and Tarzan.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 4, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup covered a week almost entirely comprised of reboots of old familiar concepts.  Included in the mix are titles like The Jungle Book (this time in live action), Little Shop of Horrors (a third time), The Dukes of Hazzard (maybe), Tarzan (this time in 3D), and Van Helsing (yes, really).  All that, and there’s an animated sequel for The Wizard of Oz, too.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTOM CRUISE TO REMAKE HUGH JACKMAN’S BIG FLOP FROM JUST 8 YEARS AGO: VAN HELSING\n\nSometimes, bizarre movie news stories emerge and then seem to disappear again so quickly that it seems to confirm they were indeed too crazy to ever be true.  Such seemed to be the case in 2010 when there was talk about Tom Cruise possibly being involved in a remake of Van Helsing, the monster mash up flop released not that long ago in 2004.  At the time, it looked like the project might have fallen apart because of Guillermo del Toro’s departure following problems with Universal over the H.P. Lovecraft adaptation At the Mountains of Madness (which Tom Cruise was also attached to at the time).  This week, a press release from Universal Pictures about a new deal with producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci for new versions of The Mummy and Van Helsing almost seemed to bury the lead, which is that Tom Cruise is indeed attached to star as Van Helsing.  This story may seem like deja vu for another reason, as last week’s top Weekly Ketchup story was also about Kurtzman and Orci, except last week it was about them signing on with Sony to be the writers of The Amazing Spider-Man 2.  Kurtzman and Orci’s other credits include cowriting the first two Transformers movies and Cowboys &amp; Aliens, and for receiving sole writing credit for the Star Trek reboot.  As for Van Helsing himself, the character first appeared as a vampire hunter in Bram Stoker’s novel Dracula, but over the last 100 years, and especially in the 2004 film, his specialty has expanded to fighting off all types and brands of supernatural monsters, preferably while wearing preposterous hats and jackets.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT WANTS TO REOPEN LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt, who through Christopher Nolan’s films Inception and The Dark Knight Rises is recently tight with Warner Bros, is now developing with the studio a third movie version of Little Shop of Horrors.  If JGL’s version goes forward, it will follow the original 1960 movie that starred a then-unknown Jack Nicholson, and the 1986 musical version starring Rick Moranis as nerdy florist Seymour.  Little Shop of Horrors is of course the story of the wackiness that ensues when a giant man-eating plant named Audrey II grows and grows, becoming increasingly demanding for more human treats.  The new version appears also to be planned as a musical, as one of the producers is Marc Platt, who produced the Broadway hit Wicked, and playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark) has been hired to work on the screenplay adaptation.\n\n\n\t\n#2 FROM THE HUNGER GAMES TO HOUDINI\n\nFans of The Hunger Games were understandly surprised when director Gary Ross decided not to sign to return for the sequel Catching Fire (which will be directed by Francis Lawrence of I Am Legend and Water for Elephants).  This week, we found out that the project that Gary Ross may take on instead is something that might fit in better with his other previous films Pleasantville and Seabiscuit. Ross is in negotiations with Summit Entertainment to direct Houdini, a biopic about the life of the famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini.  This biopic is based upon the 2006 book The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America’s First Superhero by William Kalush and Larry Sloman.   That book attracted attention for its depiction of Houdini as a spy for Great Britain, and for assisting the Secret Service and other police organizations.  As such, Summit’s adaptation is said to depict Harry Houdini as part Indiana Jones and part Sherlock Holmes, and the movie is expected to be as much an action-thriller as it is a straight biopic.  The latest screenplay adaptation was by Noah Oppenheim, a producer of the TV series The Today Show and Hardball with Chris Matthews.\n\n\n\t\n#3 EMMA WATSON AND JASON SEGEL WILL BE THERE TOO AT THE END OF THE WORLD\n\nThe End of the World is the new title of the post-apocalyptic comedy from writing partners Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg which got its start as a YouTube trailer spoof called Jay and Seth Vs the Apocalypse.  The premise of the movie is that it depicts various Hollywood celebrities as themselves as they hole up in a house with some sort of apocalypse being unleashed outside their door.  This week, the cast grew a bit larger as Emma Watson (Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movies), Jason Segel (The Muppets) and David Krumholtz (Numb3rs) all signed on to play themselves.  Other actors also playing themselves in The End of the World include the original pair of Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel, as well as James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson.  At one time, Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe was rumored to also be involved, but it looks like that plan may have been changed to include Emma Watson instead.\n\n\n\t\n#4 GUILLERMO DEL TORO TO PRODUCE TRUE HORROR STORY THE BLOODY BENDERS\n\nGuillemo del Toro is teaming up with Angry Films (Real Steel, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) to produce The Bloody Benders, a spec script based on a true horror story from the American wild west of the 1870s.  The script comes from Adam Robitel, who is described as a protege of director Bryan Singer (X-Men, Superman Returns, Apt Pupil).  The Bloody Benders tells the true story of a family who operated a hotel on the outskirts of the Kansas prairie, where they robbed and murdered their guests using a system of elaborate trap doors and hammer-to-the-skull type murder mechanisms.  Guillermo del Toro is not expected to direct The Bloody Benders.  The producers were reportedly attracted by the way the script combines genres: “Western, horror, thriller, and love story.”  This is the second project that GDT and Angry Films are developing together, as they are still trying to find a studio home for Del Toro’s adaptation of the H.P. Lovecraft horror adventure At the Mountains of Madness, in which Tom Cruise was once attached to star, back when it was being produced at Universal Pictures.\n\n\n\t\n#5 HARRY POTTER SCREENWRITER REOPENS THE JUNGLE BOOK\n\nWarner Bros has started development on a new live action adaptation of the 1894 children’s literature anthology classic The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling.  For the task, the studio has hired screenwriter Steve Kloves, who is best known for his work on seven of the eight movies in the Harry Potter series.  Steve Kloves will also direct, which will be a return long in the coming for him after last working on The Fabulous Baker Boys and Flesh and Bone in 1989 and 1993.  The Jungle Book has, of course, been most famously adapted as the 1967 Walt Disney animated film.  Curiously, this news from Warner Bros came just before another announcement from Disney itself, about a book that was itself written as an homage of sorts to The Jungle Book.  Walt Disney Pictures has secured the rights to the 2008 Neil Gaiman children’s book The Graveyard Book, which won the Newberry Medal. The Graveyard Book has been in development before, but Disney’s involvement may be just what’s needed to finally get the adaptation produced.  The Graveyard Book tells the story of a boy raised in a graveyard, with his only friends being all the supernatural ghosts and creatures there (much like how Mowgli grew up in the jungle, and was friends with the animals).\n\n\n\t\n#6 BERNADETTE PETERS AND LEA MICHELE FROM GLEE HEADLINE THE 3D CGI SEQUEL DOROTHY OF OZ\n\nDorothy of Oz is the title of an independently produced 3D CGI animated sequel to L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which of course, is most famous for being adapted as the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.  This week, the voice cast was announced.  Bernadette Peters, who recently guest-starred on the TV series Smash, will voice Glinda the Good Witch, with Megan Hilty, who played her daughter on Smash, voicing the China Princess.  The voice of Dorothy Gale comes from another musical TV series, Glee, in the form of Lea Michele.  Dorothy of Oz will depict what happens when Dorothy Gale returns to Oz to find that her friends (Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion) have disappeared, and Oz is in a state of decay (you can find out more at the official site http://www.dorothyofoz.com/).  The rest of the voice cast includes Dan Aykroyd (The Scarecrow), Kelsey Grammer (The Tin Man), Jim Belushi (The Formerly Cowardly Lion), Martin Short (The Jester), Oliver Platt (Wiser), Hugh Dancy (Marshal Mallow) and Patrick Stewart (Tugg).  Dorothy of Oz is being directed by Dan St. Pierre (Everyone’s Hero, Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 ROBERT PATTINSON HUNTS SADDAM IN MISSION: BLACKLIST AND STEALS CARS IN ROVER\n\nThe Twilight Saga doesn’t end until Breaking Dawn Part II comes out this fall on November 16, 2012, but the YA-friendly franchise’s stars are continuing to line up new roles.  This week was a big one for Robert Pattinson, who was announced as being in negotiations for two movies.  First up is Mission: Blacklist, in which Robert Pattinson will portray real life military interrogator Eric Maddox, who was involved with the manhunt in Iraq for deposed dictator Saddam Hussein.  The independent/European production will be directed by Jean-Stephane Sauvaire (Johnny Mad Dog), based on a script adapted by Erik Jendresen, cowriter of four episodes of the HBO mini-series Band of Brothers.  Robert Pattinson and Guy Pearce (Lockout, Memento) are also in negotiations to star in the Australian thriller Rover from director David Michod (Animal Kingdom).   The premise came from an idea shared between Michod and actor Joel Edgerton, and goes like this, “Pearce will play a man who pursues a group of men who stole his car through the wild and rugged Australian Outback. Pattinson will play one of the thieves.”\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE WHOLE REBOOTING-2000S-MOVIES THING MIGHT GIVE US ANOTHER RIDE IN THE GENERAL LEE\n\nWhen Sony Pictures decided to reboot a franchise which at the time was only eight years old (2002’s Spider-Man), the studio may have started a new trend: recent reboots.  Instead of having to wait decades, studios now are starting to feel comfortable, it appears, with restarting within a range of less than ten years (see this week’s top story).   The next example of this may be the latest film from writer/director Jody Hill (Observe and Report).  Jody Hill is currently writing an untitled project for Warner Bros, which is set in the American South of the 1970s, and is reportedly “inspired by the style of Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch).”  And now here’s the really crazy part… depending upon the results, Hill’s script could be rebranded as a reboot of The Dukes of Hazzard.  Originally an action comedy TV series on CBS from 1979 to 1985, The Dukes of Hazzard also became a movie in 2005 starring Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson.  If WB does decide to move forward with this Dukes of Hazzard reboot, it will clearly be a very different movie, based just on the allusion to Sam Peckinpah.  This story is a borderline Rotten Idea that can probably be best evaluated based on how much one wants to see The Dukes of Hazzard given another chance.  Another factor might also be whether or not you agree with the “Rotten” 51% RT Tomatometer score that Jody Hill‘s first film Observe and Report received.\n\n\n\t\n#1 THE STARS OF TARZAN 3D SWING IN FROM THE TWILIGHT AND RESIDENT EVIL FRANCHISES\n\nConstantin Film is a German production company and distributor best known for its genre films such as the Resident Evil franchise, the Fantastic Four movies (including Roger Corman’s 1994 version) and the recent 3D version of The Three Musketeers.  One of Constantin Film’s most ambitious upcoming projects is a CGI motion capture adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan, which comes hot on the heels of another recent ERB adaptation that featured a lot of motion capture CGI work, John Carter.   This week, we learned who will be putting on all those little ping pong ball things as Tarzan and Jane for director Reinhard Klooss (Animals United).  Kellan Lutz, who played Emmett Cullen in the Twilight movies, will play Tarzan, and Spencer Locke (yes, she’s a girl), who played K-Mart in two of the Resident Evil movies, will play Jane.  And now, here’s where you find out why this movie is the week’s Most Rotten Idea.  This version of Tarzan, which is being called Tarzan 3D, completely updates Edgar Rice Burroughs’ story for the 21st century, with a villain who is the new CEO of Greystoke Energies, the man who took over the company run by Tarzan’s deceased parents.  Here’s some more, quoted from The Hollywood Reporter, “In the script, Jane is the daughter of an African guide and is committed to the conservation and preservation of the African jungle. She eventually works with Tarzan to defeat the mercenary army of Greystoke Energies.”  It’s also worth noting that Tarzan 3D should not be confused with Warner Bros’ plans to also reboot the Tarzan franchise.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a u=513376″>RT forum message.\n                                            \n                \n            \n                \n                \n\n\n\n     ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"ratings, Holiday, CNN, french, demand, Plus, Peek, screen, TV, Amazon, SDCC, President, YouTube, Access","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Tom-Cruise-Signed-to-Van-Helsing-Reboot"},{"id":"47509216001669","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Kurtzman/Orci to Write The Amazing Spider-Man 2","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

And did we mention Pauly Shore?  Really need to say it twice for it to sink in as a reality.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nMORE VILLAIN NEWS FRESH FROM THE SET OF IRON MAN 3\n\nIf you want to see Iron Man 3 in theaters on May 3, 2013 with absolutely no knowledge of what may or may not be spoilers, you should stop reading now.  Of course, it’s likely that most of what this article covers will be revealed in the trailers for Iron Man 3 anyway.  First off, there was an online story this week at Latino Review that basically confirmed that Marvel Studios was sort of/kind of not being 100% truthful when Sir Ben Kingsley was announced as joining the cast of Iron Man 3; indeed, Kingsley is playing the Mandarin, who is traditionally Iron Man‘s biggest archenemy in the comics.  That, however, wasn’t really the story that blew most fans’ minds this week.  That honor would go to these photos, which show actor James Badge Dale in a costume that is not that of Coldblood, the code name of his character Eric Savin in the comics.  Nope, that armor is that of… Iron Patriot, who in the comics is an alter ego of one Norman Osborn, who for obvious reasons (thanks to Sony Pictures and their rights to the Spider-Man movies) can’t be in any Iron Man movie.  Interestingly, it appears that Sony’s rights to Norman Osborn don’t apply to the Iron Patriot armor itself, and so… there you go.  What this will mean in the movie universe, it appears, is that the military will possibly be creating armor with Tony Stark’s technology that uses the colors and designs of the First Avenger, Captain Steve Rogers.  And in other news, William Sadler is also rumored to now have a role in Iron Man 3 as well, but we don’t yet know who Sadler’s playing.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 SPIKE JONZE’S NEXT JOURNEY INTO THE MIND TACKLES MODERN TECHNOLOGY\n\nOnce upon a time, Spike Jonze was considered something of a directing wunderkind, after the innovative critical successes of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation.  However, in the years since 2002, Jonze has only directed one film, 2009’s adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are.  Now, Jonze is ramping up to finally bring us his fourth feature film, and the currently untitled project (which Jonze wrote) has a premise that harkens back to his first two films.  Joaquin Phoenix will play a man “who falls in love with a Siri-like computer voice.” Amy Adams (The Muppets), Rooney Mara (the remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), Samantha Morton (Minority Report) and Olivia Wilde (Tron: Legacy) will all have supporting roles (with one of them presumably providing the voice in question).  Sony Pictures has acquired the distribution rights from Annapurna Pictures, the financing company run by Megan Ellison, daughter of Oracle founder Larry Ellison.  The deal also included an upcoming project from director David O. Russell (Three Kings, The Fighter) formerly called American Bullsh** about the Abscam scandal in the 1970s that will feature both Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper.\n\n\n\t\n#2 BEYONCE HEADLINES THE VOICE CAST OF BLUE SKY STUDIOS’ EPIC\n\nOnce upon a time (like back in 2008), the upcoming Disney/Pixar movie we now know as Brave was known as The Bear and the Bow.  20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have likewise revealed the new title of Epic for their May 24, 2013 project that was formerly entitled Leafmen.  The real news this week for Epic, however, concerns the newly unveiled voice cast.  Beyonce Knowles, Colin Farrell, Johnny Knoxville, Amanda Seyfried, Jason Sudeikis, Steven Tyler, Aziz Ansari (Funny People), rapper Pitbull, and Josh Hutcherson (Journey 2: The Mysterious Island), will all be portraying either bugs, spiders, the mystical creatures known as Leaf Men, or the teen girl who ends up in their magical forest environment.   Epic is an adaptation of the 1996 children’s book The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs by William Joyce, whose books were also the inspiration for Meet the Robinsons, and the upcoming DreamWorks Animation film Rise of the Guardians.  Epic will be the third CGI animation feature film for Blue Sky Studios directed by Chris Wedge (Ice Age, Robots).\n\n\n\t\n#3 ANNE HATHAWAY’S NEXT MUSICAL WILL BE INDIE, STARTING OVER WITH SONG ONE\n\nThe trailer for Anne Hathaway’s next musical feature, the adaptation of the stage hit Les Miserables, debuted online this week, and will be in theaters before Snow White and the Huntsman.  For her next musical film, however, Anne Hathaway is in talks for a project that is considerably more scaled back.  The relatively low budget independent musical drama is called Song One, and it “tells the story of a woman who, after her brother is hurt, returns home and begins a relationship with the brother’s favorite musician.”  Song One also marks the directorial debut of Kate Barker-Froyland, who has previously directed a few short films, and previously worked with Anne Hathaway as a production assistant on The Devil Wears Prada.\n\n\n\t\n#4 MICHELLE PFEIFFER WILL BE MARRIED TO THE MOB AGAIN\n\nIt’s easy to forget this now, but two of Michelle Pfeiffer’s biggest movies of the 1980s had something very specific in common.  Her first big movie after Grease 2 was Brian De Palma’s Scarface, in which she played Tony Montana’s coke addict wife.  And then in 1988, she was Married to the Mob.  Now, a couple of decades later, Michelle Pfeiffer is in negotiations to once again play a mobster’s wife.  The movie is called Malavita, and Robert De Niro is already attached to star in the “darkly comedic actioner” as the head of the Manzoni crime family, who are collectively relocated to Normandy, France as part of the witness protection program.  It’s worth mentioning that this premise of sending an American gangster to Europe is not unlike the made-for-Netflix series Lilyhammer, starring Steven Van Zandt (from The Sopranos).  Malavita will be directed by Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita, Leon: The Professional) from his own adaptation of the book Badfellas by author Tonino Benacquista.\n\n\n\nRotten Idea of the Week\n\t\n#5 ADAM SANDLER REPLACES MARK WAHLBERG IN FOOTBALL COMEDY THREE MISSISSIPPI\n\nAbout a year or two from now, when the football comedy Three Mississippi opens in theaters as the first team up between two of Saturday Night Live’s most successful alumni, you will be able to either thank or blame Battleship.   Originally, Three Mississippi was supposed to be a reunion project for Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, after the relative success of The Other Guys.  And then, Battleship happened; but let’s explain the connection.  Universal Pictures, the studio behind Battleship, could see that the movie was probably going to be a bomb, and so for director Peter Berg’s next film, the Navy SEAL action film Lone Survivor, they wanted a star commitment.  That star was Mark Wahlberg, and the commitment had to be for Lone Survivor to be Wahlberg’s next film, and that’s how he ended up not being able to star in Three Mississippi for Warner Bros.   And so, Three Mississippi gets the distinction of being the first Ferrell/Sandler movie.  Another reunion was also thwarted in that director Adam McKay, who originally thought up Three Mississippi, will have to focus on Anchorman: The Legend Continues (also with Ferrell, but still).  Instead, Adam Sandler’s director on That’s My Boy, Sean Anders (who also directed Sex Drive) will get his own chance to work again with Sandler… really soon.   Finally, another reunion that all of this will prevent was the originally planned banter-fest between Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin, one of his costars from The Departed.  Instead, we will probably get a cast padded out with Sandler regulars.  Anyone want to watch Rob Schneider, Allen Covert and Chris Rock play football?  Oh wait, we already did… it was called The Longest Yard.\n\n\n\t\n#4 WHEN THE DOGS BEGIN TO SMELL EMILY BROWNING IN PLUSH, WILL SHE STAND ALONE?\n\nIn an alternate reality where Zack Snyder’s Sucker Punch was a huge box office hit last year, Emily Browning would probably be one of the most in-demand young actresses right now.  Browning is still finding work, but her name is not coming up for big movies quite as often as it might have otherwise.  Emily Browning did however make the cut for the lead role in Plush, the next film from director Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight, Red Riding Hood).  Browning will play a rising rock star whose band Plush is in turmoil after her brother (and band mate) dies in a drug overdose, and the band’s second album is a flop.  Browning’s character begins a relationship with the new replacement guitarist, but soon begins to wonder if “she may have let a madman into her home and family and that her mistake may cost the lives of people closest to her.”  Plush is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because all five of Catherine Hardwicke’s most recent films as director have been rated “Rotten” on the RT Tomatometer.  Will Plush turn things around for her?  Well, Hardwicke’s got time, time to wait for tomorrow, to find it, to find it.\n\n\n\t\n#3 MALIN AKERMAN, ZAC EFRON AND GOLDIE HAWN AMONG THE ENSEMBLE CAST OF THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU\n\nThis is Where I Leave You is the title of an upcoming Warner Bros ensemble comedy about a dysfunctional and non-religious family asked to fulfill their dead father’s request to sit Shivah for seven days.  The actors currently in negotiations to make up the family include Malin Akerman (Watchmen), Jason Bateman, Zac Efron, Goldie Hawn, Leslie Mann and Jason Sudeikis.  This is Where I Leave You will be the next film for director Adam Shankman after this summer’s Rock of Ages.  Shankman’s past films include Bedtime Stories, The Pacifier, Cheaper by the Dozen 2, Bringing Down the House and Hairspray, which has the distinction of being his only film to earn a “Fresh” rating on the RT Tomatometer.  If the deal goes through, this movie will also be noteworthy for being Goldie Hawn’s first movie in over 10 years, since 2002’s The Banger Sisters.  Malin Akerman also made the news this week for signing on to play Blondie lead signer Debbie Harry in the CBGB movie, which will also feature Harry Potter star Rupert Grint as Cheetah Chrome of the Dead Boys.\n\n\n\t\n#2 ROCKY VS RAGING BULL IN… GRUDGE MATCH?\n\nThis story is one that is not yet confirmed as of yet, but if it goes through, it’s a movie whose promotion pretty much writes itself.  Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone are both reportedly in negotiations with Warner Bros to star in the boxing comedy Grudge Match about two aging pugilists who take on each other in one final match.  Now, let that little piece of information sink in… yes, that’s right, we’re talking about the stars of Raging Bull and Rocky in a boxing comedy.  If that premise gets you excited, well, now here’s the bad news.  The director of Grudge Match, if it goes forward at this point, will be Peter Segal, whose filmography is comprised of several comedies that were box office hits, but not a single one ever scored higher than 53% on the RT Tomatometer.  That list includes 50 First Dates, Anger Management, Get Smart, The Longest Yard, Tommy Boy and The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.  It sounds like the news of Grudge Match got leaked online before Warner Bros was ready to make an official announcement, but a representative for Sylvester Stallone did confirm that it is a movie that he is considering.  There’s no word yet as to whether Talia Shire might be interested in costarring.\n\n\n\t\n#1 ARE YOU READY FOR THE RETURN OF PAULY SHORE?\n\nLast week, Pauly Shore, Andy Dick and a bunch of girls in bikinis got together for what was probably a wild and wacky live internet TV show on FilmOn.TV.  Anyway, the two “comedians” got talking about their time costarring together in the 1994 comedy In the Army Now.   To make a short story shorter, Andy Dick brought up the idea of a sequel called In the Army Again (along with a crack about rescuing Katy Perry from a USO show gone bad).  Pauly Shore replied, “we just need a script and someone to back the project and I’m in,” and within minutes, they actually had their funding from FilmOn.TV founder and billionaire Alki David.   Andy Dick has already written a treatment, and he and Pauly Shore will start writing a script soon.  In the Army Again will presumably be about Shore and Dick’s characters nearly 20 years later, back in the military, and getting into all sorts of wacky high jinks.  It all seems like a crazy joke, but In the Army Again has a press release and everything.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"new, HBO, Sci-Fi, Nominations, kong, australia, book, Grant, Movies, DC, History, dceu, fast, your, Christmas","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Iron-Man-3-Villain-Officially-Revealed"},{"id":"47509216189063","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Ben Kingsley Cast as Iron Man 3 Villain","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Ben Kingsley Cast as Iron Man 3 Villain\n                        Plus, new roles for Tina Fey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolie.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 13, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis Week’s Ketchup includes movies a movie about the making of Mary Poppins, a new take on Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and new roles for Steve Carell, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tina Fey, Harrison Ford, Dwayne Johnson, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nSIR BEN KINGSLEY IS TONY STARK’S NEXT VILLAIN IN IRON MAN 3\n\nDirector Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) will be starting filming of Iron Man 3 in North Carolina in just five weeks, so it’s about time that we start hearing about casting, and this week, we did.  Sir Ben Kingsley, recently of Hugo and currently filming Ender’s Game, is in final negotiations to play “the villain” in Iron Man 3.  The initial release also goes out of its way to specify that Ben Kingsley will not be playing The Mandarin, Iron Man’s traditional arch-nemesis whose existence has been teased in previous films.  All that is known about who Kingsley will play is that he is somehow involved with nanotechnology.  An interesting aspect of the whole Kingsley-isn’t-the-Mandarin announcement is that when he wears a goatee or van dyke, Sir Ben Kingsley does in fact bear a resemblance to the way the Mandarin has often been drawn.  Another possibility is that this could be a situation similar to the casting of the villain in Batman Begins, where there was some subterfuge surrounding who exactly Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe were playing.  In this case, is it possible that Sir Ben Kingsley is playing a character that doesn’t call himself The Mandarin, but basically is, you know… The Mandarin?\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 MR. AND MRS. SMITH MAY REUNITE IN THE COUNSELOR\n\nThe Counselor is the name of a movie that has been moving through development at an unusual pace, when one considers that most movies take at least a few years (if not much longer).  The Counselor was the first spec script sold by author Cormac McCarthy (The Road, No Country for Old Men) (whose novels are normally sold as existing properties).  Then, director Ridley Scott picked The Counselor as his next film after Prometheus and its profile jumped up a little bit higher yet.  Along the way, Michael Fassbender signed on to star as a successful attorney who gets involved with the illegal drug business, much to his regret.  This week, the profile of The Counselor went even higher as both Brad Pitt and Javier Bardem are now in talks to costar, with Angelina Jolie also discussing taking on a small role.  Particularly because of Ridley Scott’s involvement (though Pitt and Jolie don’t hurt), 20th Century Fox is also now in negotiations to distribute The Counselor, which starts filming in June.\n\n\n\t\n#2 TOM HANKS GOES DISNEY, AS DISNEY, IN SAVING MR. BANKS\n\nTom Hanks and Emma Thompson have signed on with Walt Disney Pictures to star in Saving Mr. Banks, a film about the making of the classic 1964 Disney musical film Mary Poppins.  Tom Hanks will be playing Walt Disney himself, who spent 14 years trying to get Australian author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to sign off on a film inspired by her series of Mary Poppins books.  The film will tell the story of Disney’s pursuit of the rights, Travers’ apprehension about the project, and her eventual dissatisfaction with the final product (particularly the animated sequences).  Saving Mr. Banks will be directed by John Lee Hancock (The Rookie, The Blind Side) from a script by Kelly Marcel, creator of the FOX TV series Terra Nova.\n\n\t\n#3 LEONARDO DICAPRIO REUNITES WITH THE AUTHOR OF SHUTTER ISLAND FOR LIVE BY NIGHT\n\nWarner Bros has acquired the rights to Live By Night,  the latest novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, Shutter Island), as a starring vehicle for Leonardo DiCaprio, who will also be producing through his Appian Way Productions.  Written as a sequel (and the second novel of a trilogy) to his 2008 novel The Given Day, Live By Night brings (some of) the same characters in Boston and Tulsa, Oklahoma from the 1910s of The Given Day into the Prohibition Era of the 1920s.  Warner Bros now has the film rights to all three books of the trilogy, including the third book that has yet to be written.\n\n\t\n#4 STEVE CARELL TO HAVE A …TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY\n\nSteve Carell is in talks with 20th Century Fox to star in the studio’s live action adaptation of the Judith Viorst children’s book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.  Steve Carell would play Alexander’s father Ben in this story about a boy going through a day full of unfortunate incidents.  This movie with a very long title I don’t want to type or paste again will be directed by Lisa Cholodenko, as her first feature after winning critical success in 2010 with The Kids Are All Right.\n\n\n\t\n#5 TINA FEY TO STAR IN LATEST NANCY MEYERS ROMANTIC COMEDY, THE INTERN\n\nParamount Pictures has made a deal to finance and distribute The Intern, the latest romantic comedy from writer/director Nancy Meyers (What Women Want, It’s Complicated, Something’s Gotta Give).  In what sounds like a continuation of themes from Meyers’ previous films, Tina Fey will play the founder of a fashion e-business who is surprised to find that the “senior” who is recruited to become her intern is actually a man in his 70s.  The two eventually develop a friendship and platonic bond (though Meyers still describes it as a love story).  Nancy Meyers reportedly already has an idea as to who will play the older man, but isn’t revealing the name until deals are underway with that actor.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#4 A MOVIE BASED ON THE NON-NARRATIVE NEED FOR SPEED VIDEO GAMES?\n\nElectronic Arts has begun development on a movie based upon their popular series of Need for Speed racing video games.   EA is getting things started by hiring screenwriter John Gatins (Real Steel, Hardball) to start work on a pitch that will be shopped around to various studios, including Paramount, Sony and Warner Bros.  Universal Pictures is not expected to be one of the studios talked to since Universal already has the Fast and the Furious franchise.  Unlike many intellectual properties, Need for Speed brings with it very few narrative demands since most of the games are mostly basic racing games with very little narrative structure.   In that way, Need for Speed is very much like the titles in the recent trend of movies based on board games and toys… and that’s why it’s one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.\n\n\n\t\n#3 DWAYNE JOHNSON TO FIGHT THE MONSTERS OF LORE\n\nWarner Bros is picking up the screen rights to the IDW Publishing comic book series Lore as a sci-fi action movie for Dwayne Johnson to star in.  Described as “Men in Black with mythological creatures,” Lore is set in a world where a long line of “Shepherds” have protected Earth from various monsters of myth, with a modern woman finding herself in the middle of the creatures’ return.  Lore was adapted by screenwriters Cory Goodman (Priest) and Jeremy Lott, who doesn’t yet have any produced films to his credit.  In addition to Warner Bros, Lore is being produced by Mad Chance (Jonah Hex, Cats &amp; Dogs) and Circle of Confusion (TV’s The Walking Dead).\n\n\t\n#2 GALE FROM THE HUNGER GAMES, HAN SOLO, AND COMMISSIONER GORDON ARE OBSESSED WITH PARANOIA\n\nDirector Robert Luketic (21, Legally Blonde) is set to start work this summer on a “corporate espionage thriller” called Paranoia, based on a novel by Joseph Finder.  Liam Hemsworth, who recently costarred as Gale in The Hunger Games, is signed to play the lead character as a low level employee who becomes a corporate spy (to avoid going to prison for a crime).  Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman are both also in final negotiations to costar.  Paranoia is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based mostly on the RT Tomatometer scores for director Robert Luketic, whose filmography also includes Killers, The Ugly Truth and Monster-in-Law.\n\n\t\n#1 SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH… AS A SUPERHERO?\n\nSony Pictures has announced ongoing development of a superhero movie based on Sabrina the Teenage Witch, who got her start in the 1960s as a spin off in Archie Comics.  The series about a precocious, well… “teenage witch” has previously been adapted as three different animated TV series and most famously, as a long running live action ABC/WB sitcom starring Melissa Joan Hart.  This new superhero take on Sabrina the Teenage Witch will be “an origin story in the vein of Spider-Man, about a young girl coming to terms with her remarkable powers.” Probably everything a person needs to know about this project is contained in this sentence from Deadline.com: “While the tone of the movie will be edgier, they are keeping her talking black cat Salem, who here is a transformed prince creating unique love stories for Sabrina.”  This live action film is being developed concurrently with a new animated series announced in September that was described as “Twilight meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”   Director Mark Waters (Mean Girls, Freaky Friday) worked on the presentation that sold Sony on the project, but he is not yet signed to direct, depending upon scheduling.  Meanwhile, over at Warner Bros, they already have the rights to a very similar character, and she’s been around (almost) as long as Sabrina the Teenage Witch… she’s called Zatanna.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a u=513376″>RT forum message.\n                                            \n                \n            \n                \n                \n\n\n\n     ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"stand-up","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Ben-Kingsley-Cast-as-Iron-Man-3-Villain"},{"id":"47509216220818","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Hugo and The Artist Top Oscar Nominees","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Hugo and The Artist Top Oscar Nomineesby Greg Dean Schmitz | January 27, 2012 |  CommentsThe entire last week has seen much of Hollywood’s movers and shakers in Utah for the Sundance Film Festival, and so this was another slow news week, and more than that, it was also one of the most “Rotten Idea” filled weeks this column has ever seen. Given that the lead story is the Academy Awards, that’s really saying something, too. The stories that did make the cut include a sequel for The Last Exorcism, two other movies involving ghosts or the supernatural, and new roles for Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Selena Gomez, Ryan Reynolds, Julia Roberts and Reese Witherspoon.This Week’s Top StoryHUGO AND THE ARTIST ARE THE TOP OSCAR NOMINEES THIS YEARThis entire week made up the biggest chunk of this year’s Sundance Film Festival, and so there was very little movie news of much note. In fact, much of what drove movie site traffic this week was actually re-reporting of earlier news stories, such as Steven Spielberg being in talks for a Moses movie, and the quasi-Monty-Python-reunion movie Absolutely Anything (previously covered in the Ketchup here and here, respectively). Nope, the one really big movie thing that actually did happen this week was the Academy Award nominations on Tuesday morning. As with any year, there were movies that did better than expected (Hugo leading the pack with 11 nominations), movies that did worse than expected (50/50, The Adventures of Tintin, Drive, and Young Adult), and movies that did pretty much as expected (The Artist, Moneyball). A few studios reacted immediately to the results, with the two films with the most nominations (Hugo and The Artist), and one of the films tied for 5th (The Descendants) all getting theatrical expansions today.Fresh Developments This Week#1 REESE WITHERSPOON AND RYAN REYNOLDS JOIN BIG EYESThe screenwriting team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski have been trying to direct a biopic called Big Eyes made since at least 2008, when Kate Hudson was first announced as landing the lead role. Big Eyes will tell the true story of American painter Margaret Keane, whose work became famous for depictions of girls and women with unusually large eyes, but it was actually her husband Walter Keane who took the credit. Tim Burton, who directed the Alexander/Karaszewski movie Ed Wood, recently came aboard the troubled project, and now Big Eyes is back on track, with filming finally scheduled to start this spring. Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Reynolds are now signed to star as Margaret and Walter Keane, which makes Big Eyes Reese Witherspoon’s second biopic, after playing June Carter Cash in Walk the Line. Celebrity biopics are often made after the inspiration has passed, but such is not the case with Margaret Keane, who is still alive at the age of 84, and it’s not yet known if Keane will be involved with the production. Although their first film as co-directors was the Rotten-rated Screwed, all three of Alexander and Karaszewski’s previous celebrity biopics (Ed Wood, The People vs Larry Flynt and Man on the Moon) were rated Fresh, and so this story is, too.#2 THE LAST EXORCISM JOINS FINAL DESTINATION IN THE IRONICALLY TITLED HORROR FRANCHISE GAMEAlthough many movie fans are not enamored of the current “found footage” horror trend, many of those movies (like, say, the Paranormal Activity franchise) get better RT Tomatometer scores than you might expect, just by gauging the online reactions. Lionsgate’s 2010 release The Last Exorcism (73% Fresh) is definitely an example of that. And so, this week’s news of a planned sequel to The Last Exorcism lands a spot as a Fresh Development. Ashley Bell will return to reprise her starring role as Nell Sweetzer in an as-yet-to-be-titled sequel which is expected to be produced quickly enough to be released in either late 2012 or early 2013. The sequel will otherwise have mostly new creatives, however, as both the director and screenwriter were not involved with The Last Exorcism. Director Ed Gass-Donnelly (This Beautiful City, Small Town Murder Songs) and screenwriter Damien Chazelle (Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench) also share a background in movies that most people have not yet really heard of, or have seen. One more difference that this sequel will have from The Last Exorcism is its planned MPAA rating, as the sequel will be aiming to be a hard-R-rated horror movie, instead of the PG-13 rating that The Last Exorcism received. Since this writer hasn’t actually seen The Last Exorcism to know if that Fresh status is warranted, you can consider this one a borderline Fresh Development… which also sort of tells you exactly what an awful week this has been for movie news.Rotten Ideas of the Week#7 THE WEEK IN CAST DEPARTURES: EVIL DEAD, DESPICABLE ME 2, LOVELACEPerhaps it was the otherwise slow news week, but three different actors/actresses dropped out of prominent movie projects this week. First up was Lily Collins, the star of the upcoming Snow White movie Mirror Mirror, who had recently been announced as starring as the female lead in the reboot of Evil Dead (as basically the female version of Ash, under a different character name). That old stand by of “scheduling issues” was given as the reason for Collins’ departure, but it’s easy to imagine the negative reactions from Evil Dead fans online could have also been an “issue.” Not really that long after dropping out of the Star Trek sequel, Javier Bardem has dropped out of playing the villain in yet another sequel, this time being Despicable Me 2, in which Bardem was to have played a character called “El Macho.” Finally, there’s Demi Moore. You might have heard something else about her this week… this writer is nearly whipping himself trying to remember what it was. Anyway, Demi Moore has also pulled out of playing Gloria Steinem in Lovelace, the Linda Lovelace biopic starring Amanda Seyfried.#6 JULIA ROBERTS, ALEC BALDWIN AND OTHERS JOIN THE NORMAL HEARTJulia Roberts, Alec Baldwin, Matt Bomer (TV’s White Collar) and Jim Parsons (TV’s The Big Bang Theory) have all joined the already cast Mark Ruffalo in the film adaptation of the Tony Award winning play The Normal Heart. The Normal Heart tells the nearly autobiographical story of the founder of a New York HIV advocacy group during the early 1980s, as written by Larry Kramer. Ryan Murphy, who is best known as the creator of the TV shows Nip/Tuck, Glee and American Horror Story, will be directing from Larry Kramer’s own adaptation of his play, in what will be his third film as director after Running with Scissors and Eat Pray Love. Mark Ruffalo will be starring in The Normal Heart, with Julia Roberts playing his wheelchair-bound doctor, Alec Baldwin playing his lawyer brother, Matt Bomer playing his boyfriend, and Jim Parsons will play a Southern gay rights activist. It’s also worth noting that a movie version of The Normal Heart had long been one of Barbra Streisand’s top priorities, but the Glee guy is succeeding where Streisand is not. The Normal Heart is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because both of Ryan Murphy’s previous films as director received Rotten scores on the RT Tomatometer.#5 SOME OF THE INSIDIOUS TEAM REUNITE FOR THE CONJURINGAnother recent horror film that did much better on the RT Tomatometer than one might think was the 2011 release Insidious. Indeed, it was the first time that a movie from director James Wan scored a “Fresh” movie after four other movies that weren’t simply Rotten; three of them earned Tomatometer scores of less than 21% (Saw IV, Death Sentence, Dead Silence). James Wan’s next movie (for New Line Cinema) until very recently had the title The Conjuring (this week, that title got dropped). The now-untitled script was written by Chad and Carey Hayes, who also were responsible for three movies poorly rated on the RT Tomatometer (House of Wax, The Reaping, Whiteout). What’s deceptive about The Conjuring, then, is that the four actors who were announced this week all seem like maybe they should be in better movies than these Tomatometers suggest The Conjuring has a chance of being. Patrick Wilson (Little Children, Watchmen) and Vera Farmiga (Source Code, Up in the Air) will play a husband/wife team of “ghost hunters” who investigate a haunted farmhouse in Rhode Island, and Ron Livingston (Office Space, Swingers) and Lili Taylor (High Fidelity, Say Anything…) will play the couple that lives there.#4 THE SAINT GETTING REBOOTED (AGAIN)In 1997, Val Kilmer starred in The Saint, an attempt to reboot the Simon Templar character first popularized in a series of novels by Leslie Charteris. The Saint has been the inspiration for 16 movies since 1938, and three different TV series, including the 1962-1969 version that helped launch Roger Moore’s career (and land him the James Bond franchise a few years later). The premise behind Simon Templar, AKA The Saint, is that he is a “gentleman thief” who travels around the world, targeting wealthy criminals, politicians and otherwise evil types, in a sort of modern variation on Robin Hood. RKO Pictures was responsible for 9 of those early 1930s-1940s Saint movies, and now the revived RKO Pictures has set its sights on rebooting The Saint in a potential new trilogy of films. RKO Pictures is doing this by hiring screenwriter Travis Wright (cowriter of Eagle Eye) to adapt one of three of the nine Simon Templar movies that RKO produced, although which three they are is currently unknown. This story is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly due to the RT Tomatometer scores of the new version of RKO Pictures to date (such as Are We Done Yet? and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt).#3 SELENA GOMEZ FINDS LOVE WHEN SHE NOTICES THAT THE SKY IS EVERYWHEREThe Disney Channel series Wizards of Waverly Place recently ended its four season run, and the show’s star Selena Gomez is as expected turning her attention towards a film career. These plans include having her own production company called July Moon. One of Selena Gomez’s first new projects as producer is an adaptation of the Jandy Nelson young adults novel The Sky is Everywhere, in which Gomez is intending also to star. Selena Gomez will play a 17-year-old “bookworm and band geek” whose romantic life is changed drastically following the death of her older sister, whose boyfriend turns to Gomez’s character, while she also attracts the interest of a French foreign exchange student. There’s no writer or director announced yet for this project. The Sky is Everywhere is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas partly because of the mixed RT Tomatometer scores for Selena Gomez’s films thus far, but that’s only part of the reason. This writer also can’t help but think that a movie about how awesome a dead sister can be for one’s love life is nearly as creepy as, you know, a teenage girl falling in love with a blood-thirsty zombie (or as some people might call it, a “vampire”).#2 RUSSELL BRAND TAKES ON THE BEETLEJUICE SEQUEL AS THE HAUNTREPRENEURSometimes, the hidden subtext in the announcement of a new movie is not the titles that are mentioned, but the movie that doesn’t get mentioned. In this case, it’s easy to see the thorough line that connects to Warner Bros’ plans for a Beetlejuice sequel. Paramount Pictures has signed Russell Brand to star in a live action “supernatural children’s tale” called The Hauntrepreneur, about an expert (Brand) who is hired by a family to build a haunted house in their neighborhood. The concept is also similar to the plans for a movie based upon the British TV series Rentaghost, which Russell Brand was formerly attached to star in (until he was eventually replaced by Ben Stiller). The Hauntrepeneur doesn’t have a director yet, and it got its start at Paramount as a spec script sold by screenwriter Scott Rosenberg (Con Air, Gone in Sixty Seconds; cowriter of Kangaroo Jack). The mostly Rotten RT Tomatometer track records of both Scott Rosenberg and Russell Brand are both part of why The Hauntrepreneur is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas.#1 THOR‘S LITTLE BROTHER TO PLAY A TIME TRAVEL-INVENTING “SCIENTIST” IN TIMELESSAustralian actor Liam Hemsworth is the little brother of Thor star Chris Hemsworth, and one of the costars of the 2010 film The Last Song and this spring’s The Hunger Games. And now, the 22 year old actor has already signed on to play a role that seems a bit old for Hemsworth: a married scientist with enough experience in his given field to invent a working time machine. The movie is called Timeless, and it’s about a man who tries to invent a time machine after his wife dies. Timeless will be directed by Phillip Noyce (Salt, The Bone Collector, The Saint) from a script by Bill Kelly (Enchanted, Premonition; cowriter of Blast from the Past). Although Phillip Noyce has directed many “Fresh” rated movies, Timeless is still the week’s Most Rotten Idea simply because the just-turned-22 Liam Hemsworth seems entirely too young for this role. Of course, to be fair, Jerry O’Connell was a year younger when he played a grad student who invented an alternate reality portal device in his Mom’s basement in Sliders, but… that was also Sliders.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Poppins, nightmare","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Hugo-and-The-Artist-Top-Oscar-Nominees"},{"id":"47509219192484","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Scarface Reboot in the Works","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Scarface Reboot in the WorksPlus, Thor 2 gets a director, and more English language remakes.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 23, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers another slow week as many of Hollywood’s movers and shakers were either in Toronto, attending various Emmy related events, or just pretending like they were doing either. The stories that did emerge as the top 10 movie development news items of the week include plans for a new Scarface movie, an Elton John biopic, director news for Thor 2 and new roles for Casey Affleck, Jeremy Renner, Michelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron.This Week’s Top StorySAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE SCARFACE REBOOTUniversal Pictures has started development on a new Scarface project that will borrow elements from both the original 1932 Paul Muni gangster movie and the 1983 film starring Al Pacino. The new Scarface will not be a sequel or a direct remake, but will instead use the same basic premise of both films: “An outsider, an immigrant, barges his way into the criminal establishment in pursuit of a twisted version of the American dream, becoming a kingpin through a campaign of ruthlessness and violent ambition.” What is being kept secret for now is where exactly the “immigrant” will be from in this third film, after the first two films featured gangsters named Tony who were Italian (1932) and Cuban (1983). Universal and producer Martin Bregman (who produced the 1983 version) are currently meeting with potential screenwriters, and there’s also no word yet about who might direct this new Scarface. The original Scarface was produced by Howard Hughes and directed by Howard Hawks (The Big Sleep, Rio Bravo) from a script by Ben Hecht (Notorious, Spellbound) (that’s a lot of H names for one movie). The Al Pacino version was directed by Brian De Palma (Carlito’s Way, The Untouchables) from a script by Oliver Stone (Platoon, cowriter of most of his films as director). The impressive credits of the men behind the first two Scarface films are listed here to demonstrate exactly how big the shoes are that the new Scarface collaborators will be attempting to fill.Fresh Developments This Week#1 THOR 2: FROM KENNETH BRANAGH TO… THE DIRECTOR WHO UGLIFIED CHARLIZE THERON?Marvel Studios shocked some fans when Kenneth Branagh, who is most associated with Shakespearean movies like Henry V and Hamlet, was chosen to direct Thor. Marvel may be setting a pattern with Thor 2, as this week, it was revealed that Marvel’s top choice is director Patty Jenkins, whose one feature film was 2003’s Monster (starring Charlize Theron as serial killer Aileen Wuornos) and the pilot episode of AMC’s series The Killing. If Marvel does indeed sign Patty Jenkins to direct Thor 2, this choice seems to suggest a story more female-centric than people generally think of when they think “Asgardian mythology.” Marvel’s Kevin Feige added a little bit of fuel to the premise speculation this week by saying that the sequel will “primarily be the journey of that character, of he and Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and how the new dynamic with his father is working out, as well as what are the broader stakes for The Nine Worlds.” In addition to Jane Foster and Sif, there are also a few female characters in the Thor comics that seem ripe for propelling the sequel’s story, starting with Amora the Enchantress, Hela the Goddess of Death and Brunnhilde, AKA Valkyrie. Marvel has already set a July 16, 2013 release date for Thor 2.#2 WAS ELTON JOHN HIGH AS A KITE WHEN HE GREENLIT ROCKETMAN?Sir Elton John and his Rocket Pictures partners had a medium-sized hit this year (especially overseas) with Gnomeo &amp; Juliet, but their next project is even more ambitious than combining talking CGI garden gnomes and Shakespeare. Elton John is teaming up with screenwriter Lee Hall (Billy Elliot; cowriter of the upcoming War Horse) on a biographical musical fantasy called Rocketman. Rocketman will blend together elements of Elton John‘s true story with his music, the lyrics of which were actually mostly written by his partner Bernie Taupin. The story is expected to include Elton John’s childhood start as a piano prodigy, his time as “a young man who rebelled against his strict upbringing,” and of course, the pop star years of flamboyant costumes and crazy eyeglasses. Elton John’s many hit songs will be used to propel the film’s narrative through choreographed sequences. As for who will actually play Elton John, the pop singer has in the past mentioned Robert Downey, Jr, but no actor was officially mentioned with the announcement of Rocketman. Part of the reason for that may be that Rocketman is likely to borrow a strategy from the Bob Dylan quasi-biopic I’m Not There, and use multiple actors to portray Elton John at different stages in his life.#3 JEREMY RENNER WILL BE THE KING OF HEISTSIt has only been 18 months since The Hurt Locker won its Oscars (including Best Picture and Best Director), and propelled Jeremy Renner’s career into the stratosphere with roles in three very big action movie franchises (Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, The Avengers and The Bourne Legacy). With those films still on the way, there have actually only been two movies since The Hurt Locker that Renner was actually in (The Town and the bathroom-break-long cameo in Thor). For his part, Renner is definitely not letting this period of interest go wasted, as he continues to sign on roles. This week, he attached himself to star in King of Heists, an adaptation of the J. North Conway nonfiction book about late 19th century bank robber George Leslie; Renner is also producing the film. During the years of 1874 to 1884, it was estimated that George Leslie’s gang of thieves were responsible for 80% of America’s bank robberies, but Leslie’s involvement remained unknown until after his death. George Leslie used his background as an architect to analyze every planned heist location, spending up to three years to plan each heist. Jeremy Renner and his producing partners have hired screenwriter Will Staples to adapt King of Thieves. Staples does not yet have a produced film to his credit, but he has sold the scripts Apaches, World’s Most Wanted and Kings of the Trail to Jerry Bruckheimer, Universal, and Walden Media, respectively.#4 DANNY MCBRIDE AND CRAIG ROBINSON JOIN SETH ROGEN AT THE APOCALYPSELast week, Seth Rogen revealed that his planned movie with Jay Baruchel originally callled Jay and Seth Versus The Apocalypse had been expanded to also include Jonah Hill and James Franco. This week, Seth Rogen talked about the comedy (now titled just The Apocalypse), which is expected to start filming in February, and added the names of frequent costars Danny McBride and Craig Robinson as well. That group of six comic actors (and real life friends) will all be playing themselves (or versions of themselves) in a story that sees them having to live together in a house while some sort of Apocalypse is going on outside, and the six friends find that living together might be worse than whatever doomn awaits them outside. One actor that appears not to be participating in this comedic experiment is Daniel Radcliffe, who Seth Rogen had in the past mentioned as a possibility.#5 CHARLIZE THERON TO INVESTIGATE CITIES OF REFUGEIn the three years since Hancock, Charlize Theron’s film presence has been minimal, with just a supporting role in The Road and a voice role in Astro Boy, both in 2009. This fall, however, Charlize Theron is starring in Young Adult (from the Juno team of Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman), and in 2012, Theron also has starring roles in Snow White and the Huntsman (as the Evil Queen) and Ridley Scott’s Prometheus. This week, Theron began negotiations with Benderspink (The Ruins, The Butterfly Effect) to produce and star in a crime thriller called Cities of Refuge. Not much is really known about Cities of Refuge except that Theron would play an “investigator” who is brought in on a case involving a murder and kidnapping that “aren’t what they seem” (when are they ever, in movies and TV shows?). Cities of Refuge was written by newcomer screenwriter Brandon Willer.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 THIS WEEK IN ENGLISH ADAPTATIONS OF FOREIGN MOVIES: THE RAID, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, SILKHollywood may have mostly taken the week off from remaking favorites from the 1980s and 1990s (except Scarface, of course). However, the Toronto International Film Festival also ended last weekend. So, there was a fair amount of news coming out from Toronto, including two stories about English language remakes of foreign films, plus a third one that has nothing to do with Toronto at all. First up is the 2006 Taiwanese supernatural thriller Silk, which Gold Circle Films (The Haunting in Connecticut, The Haunting in Georgia) has hired the screenwriting team of Marko King, Mary King and Jonathan Watters to adapt. Watters and the Kings were 50% of the six writers who worked on the 2010 Halle Berry drama Frankie &amp; Alice. The original Taiwanese film Silk was about a group of “scientists who capture the ghost of a child in an apartment and the detective charged with discovering clues to the ghost’s identity and demise.” That’s right, it’s an Asian horror movie featuring a spooky little ghost kid. Next up is The Raid, the Indonesian action movie that just won Toronto’s Midnight Madness audience award. Screen Gems is in negotiations for the English language remake rights for the movie about a SWAT team that becomes trapped in a tenement run by a mob boss, as they battle martial arts assassins and an army of machete-wielding thugs. Finally, there is the French action film Sleepless Night, which breaks the trend by not being set in an apartment building, or originating from Asia. Warner Bros has picked up the rights to pick up the English language remake rights to this story about an undercover cop trying to get his kidnapped son back from a drug dealing nightclub owner. And now, we get to the part where the Rotten Idea justification is explained, which really applies more to The Raid and Sleepless Night than Silk. At issue here is the long-standing debate over how foreign films seem to receive a certain level of attention, while remakes of those very same films are greenlit before the original foreign film even gets a chance to gain attention in the United States. Both of those films just debuted at Toronto, and before they even get a chance at their own releases in the USA, English language remakes are already being discussed. Of course, there’s no way of knowing whether any of these three film adaptations might turn out to be pretty good (as was the case, for example, with Let Me In, somewhat surprisingly), and that’s why these stories are just borderline Rotten Ideas.#3 20TH CENTURY FOX RETURNS TO ASIMOV’S ROBOTS WITH THE CAVES OF STEELIn 2004, 20th Century Fox released the Will Smith futuristic science fiction film I, Robot, which borrowed a title and some elements from the stories of Isaac Asimov. That film, however, actually started off originally as a script called Hardwired that had no connection whatsover to I, Robot or the works of Isaac Asimov (though it was eventually rewritten to do so). I, Robot went on to bring in $347 million in worldwide gross (thanks in no small part to the fact that it starred Will Smith). Now, 20th Century Fox is set to return to the general premise of a world based upon Asimov’s Robot Series with the news that the studio is developing an adaptation of The Caves of Steel, the first novel in the series. Like the movie that was released as I, Robot, Asimov’s The Caves of Steel is a murder mystery involving robots, but integral differences include a setting much farther in the future and that the human detective has a robot partner. 20th Century Fox has hired first time director Henry Hobson to work on The Caves of Steel. Hobson’s previous experience has been in designing visually striking opening and closing credits sequences for films such as Rango, Sherlock Holmes and The Hangover Part II. Hobson’s screenwriting partner will be another newcomer, John Scott 3, who is also working with Hobson on a script called Maggie, about a 16 year old girl who slowly turns into a zombie while continuing to live with her family. John Scott 3 is also a real life NASA engineer who works on the agency’s Chandra X-Ray Observatory. The Caves of Steel is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based mostly on the studio’s past results with I, Robot, and also because of the massive question marks surrounding first time directors and screenwriters like Hobson and Scott.#2 CASEY AFFLECK’S CLEAR ENUNCIATION WILL SERVE HIM WELL AS GABRIEL IN PARADISE LOSTDue to its source material, Legendary Pictures’ and Warner Bros’ adaptation of John Milton’s 17th century epic poem Paradise Lost is expected to have a fairly large ensemble cast. Director Alex Proyas (I, Robot, The Crow, Knowing) has already cast Bradley Cooper, Benjamin Walker and Djimon Hounsou as the archangels Lucifer and Michael, and the seraph Abdiel, respectively. This week brought news of who is likely to play the poem’s two most central characters, Adam and Eve, as well as Gabriel, who is traditionally described as God’s messenger angel. Camilla Belle, who is probably best known for starring in 10,000 BC, has been offered the role of Eve, and Mexican singer/actor Diego Boneta (who will be starring in the 2012 musical Rock of Ages) has been offered the role of Adam. Although John Milton’s poem was primarily about Adam and Eve’s fall from grace in the Garden of Eden, the film’s focus will be more on the war between the angels (complete with extensive scenes of aerial Angelic warfare). The latest actor to join the Heavenly Choir is Casey Affleck, who will be playing Gabriel, the chief angel who overlooks Paradise, and serves as God’s messenger to Adam and Eve. This casting decision is particularly interesting when one considers that Casey Affleck’s thick Boston accent is, well… a thick Boston accent. And that’s also why this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.#1 MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ RETURNS TO LIFE (AGAIN) IN RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION 3DIf the nine years since the 2002 release of the first Resident Evil movie hasn’t been quite long enough for you to see the film, and you’re still concerned about being spoiled, stop reading this paragraph right now. Okay, for all of those folks who are still with me, here’s the news this week for Resident Evil: Retribution 3D, the fifth film in the franchise. Michelle Rodriguez has signed on to reprise her role as Rain Ocampo. Actually, that’s not the spoiler part. No, the spoilery part is when I remind people who saw the first movie that Michelle Rodriguez’s character 1) became a zombie and was then 2) killed while still a zombie. So, that Michelle Rodriguez is returning to the franchise four movies later will surely be the basis for speculation among fans. Will Rodriguez be just seen in a flashback? Is she somehow brought back to life through wacky genetic DNA cloning? Or will she just still be a zombie? Anyway, Michelle Rodriguez is joining a cast of returning actors that also includes Milla Jovovich as Alice (obviously), Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine, Shawn Roberts (in a cameo role) as Albert Wesker, and new cast member Colin Salmon (who had a small role in three of the Pierce Brosnan James Bond movies). Resident Evil: Retribution 3D is being directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (AKA Mr. Milla Jovovich and the director of the first film and Resident Evil: Afterlife) from his own script. Filming will be done in Toronto from October to December, and Screen Gems has set a release date for Resident Evil: Retribution 3D on September 14, 2012. Resident Evil: Retribution 3D is the week’s Most Rotten Idea mostly because the RT Tomatometer scores for the three sequels are all in the 20%-24% “Rotten” range. What are the chances the fifth film will be rated more than twice as positively?For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Month, TV, Guild, Oscars, laika","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Scarface-Reboot-in-the-Works"},{"id":"47509219194533","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Top Gun Taking 3D Flight in 2012","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Top Gun Taking 3D Flight in 2012Plus, Highlander and Point Break remakes, and a new role for Whitney Houston.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 16, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup sees Hollywood’s love affairs with all things 1980s and 1990s continue with rereleases of Ghostbusters and Top Gun and remakes of Highlander and Point Break. There’s also news for the Wachowski’s next film, comedy high jinx from the South Park guys and Seth Rogen, and new roles for Hugh Grant, Whitney Houston and Arnold Schwarzenegger.This Week’s Top StoryTHE AWESOME 80S MUSTACHES OF TOP GUN ARE BEING CONVERTED TO BE IN YOUR FACE… IN 3D!The current wave of 3D movies has been used to depict many things, but so far, huge mustaches have been sadly neglected. Paramount Pictures is working to correct this, however, with the news that the milk sponges sported by Anthony Edwards and Tom Skerritt in the 1986 hit Top Gun are currently being converted to 3D for a theatrical rerelease planned for early 2012. Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and Kelly McGillis were also in Top Gun, but they sadly didn’t sport awesome 1980’s ‘staches. Oh, okay, maybe there was more to the popularity of Top Gun than the facial hair of two guys who went on to star in ER and Picket Fences. The many aerial dogfight scenes are more obviously what people would probably want to see in 3D (if they want to see any of Top Gun in 3D, that is). Top Gun is of course the tale of a group of cocky Navy pilots, a sexy female flight instructor, and how they all overcome their rivalries in the end to deal with a confrontation with Soviet MiG jets (and sing, badly, a Righteous Brothers song along the way). Top Gun was directed by Tony Scott (Ridley’s brother), who went on to direct such films as Beverly Hills Cop II, Days of Thunder, True Romance and last year’s Unstoppable. Tony Scott and Paramount are also developing a remake of Top Gun, and this 3D rerelease can most likely be seen as a test to see whether there remains an audience for the Top Gun brand name. Paramount has not yet officially announced the 3D rerelease, however, as the 3D conversion still needs to be approved by director Tony Scott. Paramount’s plans join those already announced by 20th Century Fox for 3D rereleases of Titanic (on April 6, nine days before the 100th anniversary of the RMS Titanic sinking) and the six movies in the two Star Wars trilogies (starting in 2012). And, of course, Walt Disney Pictures is rereleasing The Lion King in theaters this weekend in 3D as well. Meanwhile, in other rerelease news which can be interpreted as a test run to test modern interest in an aging franchise, Sony Pictures will be rereleasing Ghostbusters (but not in 3D) next month in October in a few hundred theaters. This news comes as the long planned Ghostbusters 3 appears to be getting closer and closer to actually being made. That announcement came via the Ghostbusters Facebook page, which is a rather clumsy way to break news, but you can find it posted on September 14 here.Fresh Developments This Week#1 MAKING THINGS UP AGAIN: THE BOOK OF MORMON: THE MOVIESometimes movie development news falls into a sort of “well, duh” category, because the newly announced film project already seemed inevitable. But, if it’s big enough of a story, it’s still news even if it surprises no one. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the masterminds behind South Park and Team America: World Police, have just announced such a project. Parker and Stone have confirmed that they do indeed plan to someday adapt their recent Broadway hit musical (and multiple Tony winner) The Book of Mormon as a feature film. For those unfamiliar with the play, The Book of Mormon tells the story of two young Mormon missionaries who travel to wartorn Uganda in search of new converts, which leads to them having to deal with a violent warlord and the realities of Third World poverty, famine and disease. And along the way, there’s about twenty rousing musical numbers and plenty of jokes (and not jokes) about faith. The Book of Mormon was cocreated by Parker and Stone with Robert Lopez, one of the cowriters/co-composers of the 2003 hit musical (and similarly toned, comedically) Avenue Q. This story, does however, have a big asterisk at the end of that announcement: “Hopefully, it will have a big run and a big tour and then we can do the movie in several years,” said Trey Parker, who is likely to direct the eventual film adaptation. That’s right, “several years,” as in probably not before 2015.#2 SETH ROGEN AND PALS DELIVER UNTO THEE: THE APOCALYPSEIt’s already been four years now since Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel produced an 86 second teaser on YouTube for a planned comedy called, at the time, Jay and Seth Versus The Apocalypse. Promoting 50/50 and Take This Waltz at the Toronto International Film Festival this week, Seth Rogen has finally confirmed that the movie should start filming in February, 2012. The title has now been shortened however, to just The Apocalypse, due to a shift in the film’s concept. Instead of just being about Jay and Seth, The Apocalypse will also costar their pals (and frequent costars) Jonah Hill and James Franco. The basic premise remains the same, but now all four actors will be playing themselves in a fictional comedic scenario in which they are stuck together in a house while some sort of apocalypse is going on outside. “They think they’ve kind of survived the worst and then they realize they all really can’t stand to be around each other as they’re stuck in this house together,” Seth Rogen elaborated. The plan is for Seth Rogen and his frequent writing collaborator Evan Goldberg (Superbad, Pineapple Express) to make their directorial debuts with The Apocalypse.#3 HUGH GRANT JOINS THE STAR STUDDED CAST OF THE WACHOWSKIS’ CLOUD ATLASHugh Grant is the latest actor to join the ever expanding cast of Cloud Atlas, the ensemble quasi-sci-fi drama adaptation that is being directed as a collaboration between Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, The International) and Andy and Lana Wachowski (The Matrix, Speed Racer). Hugh Grant joins a cast that already includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, Ben Whishaw and South Korean actress Bae Doona. Filming of Cloud Atlas started this week in Glasgow, Scotland, and there are already images of Halle Berry and Ben Whishaw filming together (other locations will include Germany and Spain). Cloud Atlas is based upon the novel by David Mitchell and tells a series of stories set across history as people in different eras and locations experience echoes from each other from both the past and future.#4 ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER NEGOTIATES HIMSELF INTO BEING A CAPTIVEAfter a few months of cooling down past his recent marital controversy, Arnold Schwarzenegger is back into a series of negotiations that will keep the bodybuilder-turned-actor-turned-governor very busy, post politics. Following the neo-Western Last Stand and a supporting role in The Expendables 2, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s third film is likely to be the independent action drama Captive. If the negotiations go through, Schwarzenegger will play a wealthy American real estate tycoon who is kidnapped while living in Brazil, and must figure out a way out of an armored truck that is buried in a Sao Paolo landfill. Captive, in other words, sounds a bit like last year’s Buried (starring Ryan Reynolds in a box), except that the addition of a second storyline involving a detective searching for Schwarzenegger expands the setting quite a bit. The Captive script was written by Benjamin van der Veen (cowriter of Che) and Kario Salem (HBO’S The Rat Pack and Don King: Only in America). First time director Nicolai Fuglsig was originally expected to direct Captive, but he has since moved on to working on a futuristic retelling of Robin Hood instead, while the producers of Captive continue to look for a director.#5 SCRAPPY NEWCOMER DUSTIN HOFFMAN MAKES HIS DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH QUARTETMovie fans with a sense of history may know (or remember!) about the time in the late 1960s when Dustin Hoffman was considered one of a group of young actors bucking the Hollywood system with roles in movies like The Graduate and Midnight Cowboy. Now 74, Hoffman hasn’t been considered a newcomer in Hollywood for a long, long, long time. But, that all changes this week, as Hoffman has started filming his directorial debut, Quartet, in the UK. Quartet is based upon a stage play by screenwriter Ronald Harwood, who also adapted this film’s screenplay. Ronald Harwood was nominated for an Oscar for The Dresser and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, and won an Oscar in 2003 for The Pianist. Quartet tells the story of the residents of a retirement home for retired opera singers who collaborate each year on Giuseppe Verdi’s birthday to raise funds for their home. The cast of veteran British (and at least one Scottish) actors includes Dame Maggie Smith, Billy Connolly, Michael Gambon, Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins and Sheridan Smith.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 ONE OF THOSE WACKY TWILIGHT KIDS WILL BE OLIVIA TWISTEDAshley Greene, the 24 year old actress best known for playing Edward’s adopted sister Alice Cullen in the Twilight Saga movies, has landed the lead role in a movie called Olivia Twisted. Based upon the classic Victorian novel Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens, Olivia Twisted will be an “ultra modern” reimagination that gender swaps the lead role into being Olivia, the leader of a gang of criminal street urchins who find themselves in the midst of a gang war after a kidnapping plot goes bad. Oliver Twist has been adapted to film a few times before, including a 1948 David Lean adaptation, the musical Oliver! in 1968, Roman Polanski’s 2005 version and the 1998 Walt Disney Pictures animated kitty cat movie Oliver and Company. Olivia Twisted was adapted by newcomer screenwriter Michael Roberts, and is also described as having a “Gothic backdrop,” which, considering the setting, probably refers more to a predominance of black clothing and eye shadow than the architectural style. There’s no word yet on who will be directing Olivia Twisted.#3 EXPECT THE HIGHLANDER REBOOT TO ARRIVE MORE THAN 28 WEEKS LATERSpanish thriller director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto, 28 Weeks Later) has been attached for a while to direct the reboot/remake of The Crow. This week, Fresnadillo added another reboot to his upcoming slate as he is now in negotiations with Summit Entertainment to direct the reboot of Highlander as well. Director Justin Lin had formerly been attached to the project, but he dropped out following the success of Fast Five, which led to Lin being attached to direct the sixth Fast and the Furious film as well. Highlander was of course the 1986 film starring Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery as members of an immortal race locked in a centuries old conflict centered around the motto, “There can be only one.” Multiple sequels, a long running TV series and now this remake, however, apparently prove that there can be more than one version of Highlander. The current reboot script was originally written by Art Marcum and Matt Holloway (cowriters of Iron Man and Punisher: War Zone), and has since been rewritten by Melissa Rosenberg, the screenwriter who adapted the five movies of The Twilight Saga.#2 WHITNEY HOUSTON TO RETURN TO THE BIG SCREEN IN SPARKLEHollywood has been trying to get a remake of the 1976 musical Sparkle going ever since the 2001 death of rising star Aaliyah (the 10th anniversary of which was just this past August 25th, by the way). Back then, the Sparkle remake was set up at Warner Bros, but in the decade since, the studio put Sparkle into turnaround, and it is now a Sony Pictures property. That studio has announced that the three performers now in negotiations (or signed) to star in Sparkle are American Idol winner Jordin Sparks (Sparks, Sparkle… cute, Sony), Mike Epps (of the Friday series of comedies) and (here is the real shocker), Whitney Houston. The original 1976 film was inspired by the story of the Supremes, and told a fictional story of three sisters who rise from being church choir singers to being national pop stars, until their sudden fame causes their personal lives to unravel. Jordin Sparks will play the trio’s leader, Whitney Houston is in talks to play the sister’s controlling mother, and Mike Epps will play Satin, a stand up comedian “who marries one of the sisters and gets her hooked on drugs.” The other two sisters have not yet been cast. Mara Brock Akil, the creator of the BET series The Game adapted this remake’s script, and her husband Salim Akil (who has directed every episode of that series and also several episodes of the UPN series Girlfriends) will direct the Sparkle remake. Salim Akil also recently made his feature debut with the 2011 romantic comedy Jumping the Broom. The Sparkle remake will be Whitney Houston’s first theatrical film as an actress in 15 years since 1996’s The Preacher’s Wife, and only her fourth ever (the first two being The Bodyguard and Waiting to Exhale). On television, Whitney Houston has only appeared in one production since 1996, a year later as the Fairy Godmother in the TV movie Cinderella.#1 REMAKE FEVER CONTINUES ITS CREEP INTO THE EARLY 1990S WITH POINT BREAKJust a few weeks ago, the Most Rotten Idea of the week was the news that remake fever had crept into the 1990s with news of a planned Flatliners remake. Films like The Crow and Spider-Man had already long since been announced as getting remakes, but it seemed like another sign that producers in love with remakes were starting to run out of ideas from the 1980s. More evidence of this slight change in the trend came this week with the announcement from Alcon Entertainment and Warner Bros of plans to remake the 1991 action thriller Point Break. Keanu Reeves and the late Patrick Swayze (whose Dirty Dancing was also recently announced as being remade) starred in the original Point Break as, respectively, a young FBI agent and the leader of a group of surfing, sky diving bank robbers (which the FBI agent infiltrated). The new Point Break is confirmed to be still set in the world of “international extreme sports,” but the coyness of that description seems to imply that the new film may tackle other activities that the first film did not. This reboot is being adapted by screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (Salt, Equilibrium, Law Abiding Citizen), who also cowrote the upcoming remake of Total Recall (starring Colin Farrell in the Arnold Schwarzenegger role). As part of this remake deal, Alcon Entertainment also secured the television and video game rights to Point Break.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"movies, Poppins, Schmidt, Witch, frames, ABC, Logo, venice, Spectrum, toronto, curtis, shows","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Top-Gun-Taking-3D-Flight-in-2012"},{"id":"47509217692317","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Benicio Del Toro as the Villain in Star Trek 2?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Benicio Del Toro as the Villain in Star Trek 2?Plus, some planned blockbusters get rewrites, and movies based on Where's Waldo? and a Facebook game.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 11, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers a relatively slow one, following last week’s which was full of big movie franchise news. At least one big franchise (Star Trek) does get covered here, but technically, even that happened last week, just after the Ketchup was published last Friday. Other stuff that made the cut this week includes movies based on Absolutely Fabulous, Where’s Waldo? and the Facebook game Monster Galaxy, and new roles for Steve Carell, Michael Fassbender, Clive Owen and Elijah Wood.This Week’s Top Story“KHAAAANNN” YOU SEE BENICIO DEL TORO AS THE VILLAIN IN STAR TREK 2?With the large ensemble cast already signed to return for the sequel to the 2009 reboot of Star Trek, the biggest question mark has always been who would be joining them as the new villain. The answer was revealed this week to be Puerto Rican/Spanish actor Benicio Del Toro, who won an Oscar for Traffic, and also costarred in Sin City, Snatch and The Usual Suspects. The deal came after meetings between Del Toro and producer/director J.J. Abrams, although Abrams reportedly allowed one detail to remain a mystery even to Del Toro himself: what character would Benicio Del Toro be playing? The obvious guess (which may or may not be correct) among fans would be Khan Noonien Singh, a super soldier from the past who was portrayed by Mexican actor Ricardo Montalban in both the original 1960s TV series (“Space Seed”) and in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. The sequel has been written by returning writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, as well as LOST executive producer Damon Lindelof, who also collaborated with Orci and Kurtzman on Cowboys &amp; Aliens, and cowrote Ridley Scott’s upcoming science fiction epic Prometheus. Filming of the Star Trek sequel is scheduled by Bad Robot and Paramount Pictures to start in January, 2012.Fresh Developments This Week#1 RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE RUSSIAN SPIESAlthough 20th Century Fox set plans for a sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes into motion just last week, the project is far from ready to go, allowing director Rupert Wyatt time to take on another film. Wyatt has been a hot property in Hollywood since the film’s release, and this week, he appears to have found his next project. Wyatt is in negotiations with Warner Bros to direct Londongrad, a spy movie based upon the real events of the final weeks of the life of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko. Litvinenko made international news in November, 2006 when he became mortally ill in London from poisoning by radioactive polonium-210, and subsequently made death bed accusations that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered his execution. Michael Fassbender, who costarred in this summer’s other 20th Century Fox reboot/prequel (X-Men: First Class) is also in negotiations to star in Londongrad as Alexander Litvinenko. Screenwriter David Scarpa, who wrote the 2008 remake The Day the Earth Stood Still and cowrote The Last Castle, adapted the Londongrad script from the Alan Cowell book The Terminal Spy.#2 IT WORKED FOR SEX AND THE CITY, SO WHY NOT… ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS: THE MOVIE?British comedienne/actress Jennifer Saunders has announced plans to write a movie based upon the popular and long running BBC TV series Absolutely Fabulous (which she also created). Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley starred in the various (and still continuing) incarnations of Absolutely Fabulous as two older women whose various traits include a fascination with staying in touch with youth culture (despite their ages) and the consumption of mass quantities of drugs and alcohol. The BBC has recently commissioned three new Absolutely Fabulous TV specials, the first of which will be air during the Christmas, 2011 season. Jennifer Saunders is currently busy working on the Spice Girls stage musical Viva Forever in London, but expects to start writing the Absolutely Fabulous movie in 2012. The premise of Ab Fab: The Movie appears to borrow its set up from The Hangover, as it will start with “Patsy and Edina waking up hungover in the empty drifting yacht of an oligarch in the middle of the ocean.” Ab Fab: The Movie will actually be the second movie based upon the series, as there was already a French film in 2001 called Absolument Fabuleux based upon the series. The “Fresh or Rotten” status of an Absolutely Fabulous movie probably depends upon whether one is a fan of the show, so it’s a borderline Fresh Development this week.Rotten Ideas of the Week#7 THIS WEEK IN BIG BUDGET REWRITES: GODZILLA, ASTEROIDS, SINGULARITY, ONE THOUSAND A.E.This entry is a catch-all laundry list item covering four different movies that all had two things in common: they’re big budget science fiction movies, and they all got rewrites this week. That last part is not necessarily “Rotten” in every case (and in fact, it might be a good thing), but there’s enough that’s “Rotten” about at least three of the four to still get this group story listed here. Possibly the Freshest of the four is Warner Bros’ and Legendary Pictures’ planned reboot of Godzilla, to be directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters). The script was formerly being worked on by David Goyer, but now it will be rewritten by Max Borenstein (2003’s Swordswallowers and Thin Men), who has lately become something of a WB studio darling (although none of his projects have yet been produced). Over at Universal Pictures, the studio has hired one of the cowriters (Evan Spiliotopoulos) of next year’s Snow White and the Huntsman to rewrite their adaptation of the Atari arcade game Asteroids. Although Asteroids was ostensibly just about a little triangle shooting dots at big rocks (turning them into smaller rocks), the movie’s story is now described as being “the story of two estranged brothers that must team up to save Earth from an alien race.” In the case of One Thousand A.E., it’s a case of a writer (Stephen Gaghan of Syriana and Traffic) with a pretty good resume signing on to rewrite the new film from a director with a spottier track record (M. Night Shyamalan). Will Smith and Jaden Smith will star in One Thousand A.E. as a father and son who crash land on Earth a thousand years after mankind has abandoned the planet. Finally, there is Singularity, the next big budget science fiction extravaganza from director Roland Emmerich, the director of that other Godzilla reboot. The $175 million Sony project was expected to start filming in March, but it has now been put on hold while Singularity gets a rewrite by Ray Kurzweil, a “futurist and AI specialist.” Kurzweil’s hiring suggests that the problems with Singularity involve the science behind the premise, which involves “a young man whose body is made up of a swarm of nanobots, giving him all sorts of human powers at the same time it brings unwanted attention from an evil corporation.”#6 MGM ASKS WHERE’S WALDO?Just a week after Walden Media and Jennifer Lopez announced movie plans for Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, a very similarly themed movie project has also been announced. MGM has acquired the feature film rights to the Where’s Waldo? franchise from Classic Media, based upon the series of books created by Martin Handford, first published in 1987. The Where’s Waldo? books (and also videogames, etc) involve large crowd shots that challenge the reader to find the thin lead character wearing a red-and-white-striped sweater. MGM is just the latest studio to start development on a Where’s Waldo? live action movie, following previous attempts at both Nickelodeon/Paramount (in the early 2000s) and Illumination/Universal (in 2009). Where’s Waldo? is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based mostly on the non-narrative nature of the puzzle books.#5 CLIVE OWEN CAN’T RECALL WHY HE’S STARRING IN RECALLClive Owen has signed on to star in an independent thriller entitled Recall, about an NSA agent trying to piece together what exactly happened during a botched hostage rescue operation. Recall will be the first film in over a decade for director Harold Becker, since 2001’s Domestic Disturbance. Harold Becker’s filmography, which also includes Sea of Love and Mercury Rising, includes a total of 9 movies with RT Tomatometer scores, only 3 of which are “Fresh” (and 2 of those are early in his career: Taps and The Onion Field). Becker’s screenwriting partner on Recall is someone else who has mostly been (nearly) inactive in the last decade, Paul Schrader, who is still best known for his collaborations with Martin Scorsese, such as Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, The Last Temptation of Christ and Bringing Out the Dead. Harold Becker and Paul Schrader also worked together on the 1996 film City Hall. The independent production company Moonstone Entertainment aims to start filming of Recall in March, 2012 at locations in Washington DC and Bulgaria.#4 MGM ORDERS UP SOME KILLER PIZZAMGM is in negotiations to acquire the feature film rights to Killer Pizza, a novel by Greg Taylor about “a 14 year old boy who lands a summer job at a pizza joint that is actually a front for a monster hunting enterprise.” Director/producer Chris Columbus is one of the film’s producers, but he is not expected to direct, as that job is more likely to go to Adam Green, who adapted the script from the novel. Adam Green is an independent horror filmmaker best known for Hatchet (50% RT Tomatometer, Rotten), Hatchet II (36% RT Tomatometer, Rotten) and Frozen (60% RT Tomatometer, Fresh). Chris Columbus reportedly brought Killer Pizza to MGM because he knew that the studio was interested in “Gremlins and Goonies-type fare.” Killer Pizza is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas partly because of Adam Green’s RT Tomatometer track record, but also because there are a lot more “Rotten” movies that tried to be like Gremlins and The Goonies than those that were actually as good.#3 ELIJAH WOOD IS A REMAKE MANIACLord of the Rings star Elijah Wood has signed on to play the lead role as the serial killer Zito in the remake of the 1980 slasher flick Maniac. Reasons for this being a Rotten Idea lie in the Wikipedia description of Zito, as “a middle-aged, overweight, Italian-American loner,” and the fact that Elijah Wood… doesn’t really seem like he’d be great at “being” any of those things. This remake of Maniac was cowritten by horror director Alexandre Aja (Mirrors, Piranha 3-D), who also directed the 2006 remake of Wes Craven’s The Hills Have Eyes. The remake of Maniac will be directed by Franck Khalfoun, who previously directed P2, which received a “Rotten” Tomatometer score of 34%, which is another reason why this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.#2 STEVE CARELL IS ONE OF DAVE BARRY’S LUNATICSUniversal Pictures has acquired the feature film rights to the novel Lunatics by Dave Barry and Alan Zweibel, who will also adapt their book’s script. The plan is for Steve Carell to star in the comedy about two “soccer dads” in New Jersey whose “minor feud escalates to create worldwide consequences.” Dave Barry’s novel Big Trouble was also previously adapted as a 2002 movie (RT Tomatometer “Rotten” score = 48%) starring Tim Allen and Rene Russo. Alan Zweibel’s career as a screenwriter includes cowriting Dragnet, The Story of Us and the adaptation of his novel North, of which film critic Roger Ebert once wrote, “I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.” That Lunatics gave me an opportunity to use that famous North quote is part of why it is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.#1 FIRST THE SOCIAL NETWORK, NOW MOVIES BASED ON FACEBOOK GAMES: MONSTER GALAXYWith rumors and reports about possible movie projects based on games like Angry Birds and Farmville, the basic premise of this story is not entirely new news, but it’s certainly part of a growing trend. Gaia Interactive, the company behind the Facebook game Monster Galaxy, has signed a deal with Radar Pictures to adapt the game into an animated feature film. Radar Pictures was the production company behind movies like The Invention of Lying, All About Steve, Swing Vote and the 2005 remake of The Amityville Horror, but mostly the press release stresses that producer Ted Field also produced the Vin Diesel science fiction film Pitch Black. Monster Galaxy has been one of the top 10 most played Facebook games for over six months, based upon a game style that many compare to Pokemon… except it’s on Facebook. Monster Galaxy is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because if you’re going to make a Facebook game movie, Farmville seems the more obvious choice? (Not that the idea of a Farmville movie is particularly “Fresh” either…)For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Anna, Star, Summer, game-of-thrones, Prime, Mary, Fox, saw, Swim","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Benicio-Del-Toro-as-the-Villain-in-Star-Trek-2"},{"id":"47509219190435","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Mortal Kombat Reboot is Actually Happening","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Mortal Kombat Reboot is Actually HappeningPlus, a new Roald Dahl adaptation, and a Dead Island movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 30, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes new life for the Mortal Kombat film franchise (as well as another movie based on the Dead Island video game) and three different biopics (about Moses, Mount Everest, the founder of Casablanca Records and convicted murderer John du Pont).This Week’s Top StoryWARNER BROS. SAYS “TEST… YOUR MIGHT (EXCELLENT). FIGHT! MORTAL KOMBAT!“It’s now been sixteen years since New Line Cinema released the first movie based upon the martial arts/fighting video game franchise Mortal Kombat. There had been movies based upon video games before (like 1993’s Super Mario Bros), but Mortal Kombat had the distinction of being a genuinely successful action/genre film with a pretty great soundtrack that seemed to convey the entertainment of the video game to the big screen in a way that hasn’t been realized very often in the years since. That movie was followed in 1997 by the less effective Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and the video game franchise has been continuing on ever since. In 2010, director Kevin Tancharoen, who worked on the 2009 remake of Fame and Glee: The 3D Concert Movie, teamed up with other producers to deliver an 8 minute live action short film called Mortal Kombat: Rebirth. This led to a series of short films called Mortal Kombat: Legacy, featuring actors like Michael Jai White and Jeri Ryan. The reason for that original short was said to be as a “proof of concept” to show how Mortal Kombat could return as a feature film franchise. Well, this week, Kevin Tancharoen and crew got what they asked for, as New Line Cinema and Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment are now developing a new live action Mortal Kombat film that Tancharoen is attached to direct. Production is expected to start sometime in 2012 (the year that marks the 20th anniversary of Mortal Kombat) for a release in 2013. It’s not yet known if all of the actors from the Mortal Kombat shorts will return for the reboot.Fresh Developments This Week#1 JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE GOES BACK TO THE 1970S FOR SPINNING GOLDJustin Timberlake’s expansion into the feature film business continued this week with the announcement of his first project as a feature film producer. Spinning Gold is the new title for the long planned biopic of music executive Neil Bogart, who founded Casablanca Records in 1973. Under Neil Bogart, Casablanca Records quickly became a label synonymous with two quite different, and yet parallel and integral developments in 1970s music: the rise of glam rock (KISS, T. Rex) and the popularity of disco (Donna Summer, the Village People, Cher), all of whom were signed to Casablanca. Neil Bogart’s legacy became cemented to the 1970s, ultimately, when he died at the age of 39 in 1982 after a battle with cancer and lymphoma. Two of Justin Timberlake’s producing partners on Spinning Gold are Neil Bogart’s sons Evan “Kidd” Bogart and Timothy Scott Bogart, who is also adapting the script. Now 30, Timberlake is currently almost exactly the same age that Neil Bogart was when he signed groups like KISS and Parliament in the early days of Casablanca Records. The next step is finding a director for Spinning Gold. A soundtrack album of classic songs by Casablanca recording artists covered by the pop stars of today (one of whom will almost certainly be Timberlake himself) is also planned.#2 STEVE CARELL TO PLAY FOXCATCHER FOR MONEYBALL DIRECTORDirector Bennett Miller appears to have knocked another one out of the critical park this past week with his second narrative feature, Moneyball (his first two films were The Cruise, a documentary, and 2005’s Capote). What all three of Miller’s films have in common is a basis on real life stories, and Bennett Miller is already lining up his fourth film which will also follow that pattern. Steve Carell will star in the dramatic film Foxcatcher, about the true story of the murder of Olympic wrestler David Schultz by chemical fortune heir John du Pont in 1996. John du Pont was convicted on a charge of 3rd degree homicide and was sentenced to 13 to 40 years in prison, where he died in 2010 at the age of 72. Bennett Miller plans to start filming this independent production in March, 2012, working from a script by E. Max Frye (Something Wild, Palmetto) and Capote screenwriter Dan Futterman (he’s also cowritten several episodes of HBO’s In Treatment). The casting of Steve Carell is significant in that it appears to mark a return to drama (ala 2006’s Little Miss Sunshine) after several years of an emphasis on comedies like Evan Almighty, Dinner for Schmucks and Crazy Stupid Love.#3 DREAMWORKS DELIVERS THE BFG; VIDEO GAMERS DISAPPOINTED BY WHAT THAT ACTUALLY ISIn 1982, children’s book author Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach) wrote and published a book called The BFG about a Big Friendly Giant who befriends a little girl named Sophie and then they go off and have magical adventures together. And then, in 1993, id Software unleashed the video game DOOM on the world, which featured the powerful weapon, the BFG 9000, and a whole generation got a completely different definition of those initials (“Big F***ing Gun”). Needless to say, DOOM fans may be disappointed to hear that the movie that DreamWorks is now developing as a feature film does not involve blasting away at demons from the gates of Hell. Although live action is not specifically mentioned in the lengthy article announcing the project, The BFG is also not described as being a DreamWorks Animation project, so the implication appears to be that it will be live action. Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, whose latest hit was The Help, are the producers working with DreamWorks on The BFG. For The BFG, the studio that Steven Spielberg cofounded is reaching way, way back into his filmography, by hiring screenwriter Melissa Mathison, whose biggest claim to fame was the script to E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (as well as The Indian in the Cupboard and cowriting The Black Stallion).#4 MICK JAGGER KNOWS A FEW THINGS ABOUT BEING A TABLOID STARIt’s been a long while since Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones joined the ranks of musicians-turned-actors like Bob Dylan, David Bowie and John Lennon in 1970 with roles in Ned Kelly and Performance. Jagger has had intermittent roles in the years since in movies like Freejack and The Man from Elysian Fields, but his film profile has been much lower than David Bowie, in particular. Jagger now appears to be working to return to the movies with plans to produce and star in a movie called Tabloid. Tabloid will be an adult thriller about “a global media mogul with dubious morality” (who Jagger would play) and “a young journalist who gets seduced and sucked into that immoral world.” Screenwriter Josh Olson (A History of Violence; cowriter of Batman: Gotham Knight) has been hired by Jagger’s production company to start work on the Tabloid script, based upon Jagger’s own story idea. Josh Olson also has contributed to the script for One Shot, the movie based on the novel by Lee Child which is currently filming, with Tom Cruise playing a character who in the books was described as a hulking, intimidating presence.#5 REESE WITHERSPOON AND MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY WALLOWING IN THE ENSEMBLE CAST OF MUDIndependent director Jeff Nichols got his career started with 2007’s Shotgun Stories, and has his second film Take Shelter opening this week. Nichols started production this week on his third film, entitled Mud, which will feature a large and fairly impressive ensemble cast as part of its Southern coming-of-age dramatic tale about two 14-year-old boys who encounter a fugitive hiding out on an island in Mississippi. Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon (despite her recent head injury) were among the first actors to be cast. This week, they were joined by six more actors, including Joe Don Baker (Jack Wade from the Pierce Brosnan Bond films), Sarah Paulson (Serenity, What Women Want), Michael Shannon (The Runaways, Boardwalk Empire, General Zod in the upcoming Man of Steel) and Sam Shepard (The Right Stuff, Days of Heaven).#6 WHY MAKE A MOVIE CALLED EVEREST? BECAUSE IT’S THEREGeorge Mallory was an English mountaineer who became famous posthumously for his attempts to scale Mount Everest in the 1920s (nearly 30 years before Edmund Hillary). It was also George Mallory who gave the world the famous “because it’s there” quote about why people want to climb Mount Everest. Mallory, however, went missing during his third expedition in 1924 and his body wasn’t discovered until 1999. What Mallory left behind is a lingering mystery about whether or not he actually achieved his goal or not. Now, Sony Pictures has signed director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Mr. and Mrs. Smith) to develop a film called Everest about Mallory’s quest to reach the mountain’s summit. Liman already has several other projects in development, including the science fiction projects Luna (a heist movie set on the Moon) and the alien invasion war movie All You Need is Kill (for which Brad Pitt’s name was mentioned this week, in other news). Everest is seen as having an advantage in getting made earlier because Doug Liman is himself an avid mountain climber. Screenwriter Sheldon Turner (The Longest Yard; cowriter of Up in the Air) is currently adapting the Everest script from the Jeffrey Archer novel Paths of Glory, which attempted to fill in the holes in Mallory’s true story.#7 THE LONE RANGER IS BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN AFTER ALLBack in early August, the story broke that Walt Disney Pictures was pulling the plug on their $250+ million live action reboot of The Lone Ranger. More often than not, these sort of big budget movies that are abandoned are never heard from again (though obviously, there are exceptions to that rule). The last several weeks have seen many articles and reports written about the attempts to get the project back on its feet. The stated goal was always to get the budget down to the $215 million range, as long as star Johnny Depp (who will play Tonto) stayed attached. Complicating matters was Depp’s insistence that he would only star in The Lone Ranger if director Gore Verbinski (the director of the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies for Disney) was also still attached, despite reports that Verbinski (and his big action scene plans) was part of the budgetary problem. Another factor that appears obvious by the timing of when Disney initially pulled the plug was the box office failure of Cowboys &amp; Aliens, which, as a western/genre mashup, bears some resemblance to The Lone Ranger. Or, maybe, Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig just don’t have the box office appeal of Johnny Depp. This week, however, all of that became material for the history books, as a deal has been reached, and filming of The Lone Ranger is now scheduled to start in January or February of 2012. Armie Hammer (The Social Network) is also still attached to star as the title character, and British actress Ruth Wilson (from the TV show Luther) is still expected to be the female lead. What is less certain is whether this delay in filming will cause Disney to change the current release date of December 21, 2012. The new budget deal may also mean script changes for screenwriter Justin Haythe (Revolutionary Road; cowriter of The Clearing). Reports during this budget kerfuffle described the premise of The Lone Ranger as involving werewolves, Native American mythology and Verbinski’s plans for what may be the most ambitious railroad action sequence ever filmed. Whether this story about the revived film should be listed as a “Fresh Development” or a “Rotten Idea” depends upon the reader’s own opinion about whether a $200+ million tentpole action movie starring Johnny Depp as Tonto is a good idea or not.Rotten Ideas of the Week#2 WARNER BROS. WANTS STEVEN SPIELBERG FOR THE MOSES EPIC GODS AND KINGSThe late 1990s was the time of high expectations for the new studio called DreamWorks SKG, and one of the nascent company’s earliest and most ambitious projects was the 1998 animated film The Prince of Egypt, which retold the Biblical story of Moses. Now, Warner Bros is attempting to develop a live action Moses movie called Gods and Kings, and the director WB is going after is Steven Spielberg (who is credited with giving Jeffrey Katzenberg the original idea of making The Prince of Egypt). At this point, Warner Bros has not yet begun official negotiations with Spielberg, but he has read the script. Spielberg already has a very busy schedule which includes post production on War Horse and The Adventures of Tintin, as well as filming dates for both Lincoln and Robopocalypse that will likely keep him busy well into 2013. Gods and Kings is reportedly based upon the life of Moses as depicted in the Book of Exodus and other Old Testament stories. Gods and Kings got its start as a treatment by producer Matti Leshem (who has mostly worked on the USA Rock Paper Scissors League Championship broadcasts). Leshem’s treatment then became a screenplay by Michael Green (cowriter of Green Lantern; writer of several episodes of Smallville and Kings) and Stuart Hazeldine, who worked on the recent Riverworld TV movie as well as cowriting Warner Bros’ adaptation of John Milton’s Paradise Lost. The catchy headline for this story is the idea of Steven Spielberg directing a live action Moses epic. However, the reason this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas has more to do with the screenwriters that have been working on Gods and Kings, and the implication that Warner Bros might be eyeing Gods and Kings as some sort of flashy Biblical action movie (in the same vein as their other flashy quasi-Biblical action movie, Paradise Lost).#1 LIONSGATE ANNOUNCES DEAD ISLAND MOVIE, MENTIONS THE WORD “TRAILER” 13 TIMESCompiling the Weekly Ketchup each week, this writer reads a lot of press releases. This week, Lionsgate announced plans for a feature film based on the recent cross-platform survival horror video game Dead Island. That press release mentioned the word “trailer” thirteen times. The reason for that is that the trailer for the Dead Island video game was something like a short film, telling the story (in reverse) of a father being attacked by his zombiefied daughter while on vacation on a tropical island beset by a zombie invasion. It’s a very nice trailer, but it’s just sort of humorous exactly how much Lionsgate’s press release dwells on that trailer, and not so much on other little details, like say, the actual video game (which generally has received positive reviews). Lionsgate’s partner on the Dead Island movie will be producer Sean Daniel, who is best known for working with Universal Pictures on The Mummy franchise, as well as the 2002 spinoff The Scorpion King and 2010’s The Wolfman. As for why Dead Island is this week’s Rotten Idea, it’s basically due to the vibe that Lionsgate and Sean Daniel are perhaps a little bit too impressed with the narrative power of a dialogue-free music video that tells its story in reverse. Do they think they can make a whole movie like that?For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"japanese, 007, jurassic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Mortal-Kombat-Reboot-is-Actually-Happening"},{"id":"47509219202730","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Thor 2 Gets A Director","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Thor 2 Gets A Director\n                        Also, new roles for Leonardo DiCaprio, Chuck Norris, and John Travolta.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 5, 2011                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nAfter a slow post-Comic Con week, this week’s Ketchup sees Hollywood getting back into full swing, with news for big superhero movies like Thor 2 and Man of Steel, and a laundry list of casting announcements for stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert DeNiro, Chuck Norris (yes, really), Brendan Fraser and Reese Witherspoon.  Also included in the mix are The Expendables 2, a remake of Short Circuit, and at least three CGI animated family films.  This week also has the rare distinction of having six “Rotten Idea” stories out of ten, giving Rotten-ness in Hollywood an unwanted plurality.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWILL THOR 2 BE ABOUT A GAME OF THRONES?\n\nOne of the first things movie fans knew about Marvel and Disney’s plans for a sequel to Thor was that Kenneth Branagh would not be returning as director.  This week, we learned that the job looks likely to go to director Brian Kirk, who has mostly worked in television, directing episodes of shows like Dexter, The Tudors, Boardwalk Empire, and most interestingly, episodes 3, 4 and 5 of the first season of HBO’s Game of Thrones.  Since both are fantasy adaptations set in worlds of political intrigue, it’s easy to see the through line that leads Brian Kirk from directing Game of Thrones to directing the Thor sequel.  Not much else is yet known about Thor 2, except that it is described as featuring “a large cast of Asgardians and creatures in the Norse mythology-set world,” which suggests that perhaps Thor 2 will be set more in Asgard and Midgard than the original film was.  Walt Disney Pictures has already scheduled Thor 2 for a release date of July 26, 2013.  Thor 2 wasn’t the only Marvel character to attract online buzz this week, however, as the TwitchFilm.com site this week reported on two separate Marvel projects: Doctor Strange and Guardians of the Galaxy.  There wasn’t much actual news to either story, as both Doctor Strange and Guardians of the Galaxy have been known about since last summer.  However, the online movie fan community at large has been acting like it’s “news,” and so these stories get mentioned here too. \n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 THE NEW PERRY WHITE SAYS: DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT’S AIR YOU’RE FLYING THROUGH?\n\nMuch of 2011 has been filled with casting news for Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel, but since Superman has such an extensive supporting cast of characters, we’re not quite done with them yet.  Laurence Fishburne has been cast as Perry White, the editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet, the newspaper that Clark Kent works for (though I doubt most people reading this column needed that extra explanation).  Jackie Cooper previously played Perry White in the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, and Frank Langella portrayed the editor in Superman Returns.  Laurence Fishburne joins a star-studded Man of Steel cast that already includes Henry Cavill (Supes, himself), Amy Adams (Lois Lane), Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as the Kents, Russell Crowe and Julia Ormond as Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van, Michael Shannon and Antje Traue as Kryptonians General Zod and Faora, and Harry Lennix and Christopher Meloni as military officers.  This week also gave us the news that post-Superman, Zack Snyder is planning on directing a much smaller movie called The Last Photograph, about two men who are “inspired by a photograph to travel war torn Afghanistan.”  Man of Steel has been scheduled by Warner Bros for a release date of June 14, 2013.  The first photo of Henry Cavill in the Superman costume was also released online this week, along with our first image of Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle (AKA Catwoman) in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises. \n\n\t\n#2 LEONARDO DICAPRIO MAY BELIEVE IN THE CREED OF VIOLENCE\n\nBack before it was called Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino sometimes referred to his upcoming slave era project as “a Southern,” which was his way of saying it would be a Spaghetti Western set in the South.  Leonardo DiCaprio will be playing the evil slave owner villain in Django Unchained, and now it looks like he might be involved with another western.  Based upon a 2010 novel by Boston Teran, The Creed of Violence is set in the 1910s, and is the story of “a criminal named Rawbone who tries to take a cache of weapons into Mexico as part of the country’s revolution but is caught and then accompanied by a government agent who, it turns out, shares a secret past with him.”  Leonardo DiCaprio is reportedly interested in one of the two leads, either Rawbone or the government agent, though it’s not yet known which.  The Creed of Violence is set up at Universal Pictures, with Todd Field (Little Children, In the Bedroom) attached to direct from his own screenplay adaptation.  Todd Field’s first two films were both intense family dramas, so a western would be a departure.\n\n\t\n#3 MCAVOY, BELL, AND CUMMING IMMERSE THEMSELVES IN FILTH\n\nIrvine Welsh is a Scottish novelist and playwright who is probably best known for the novel Trainspotting, which was adapted in 1996 as a film that helped launch the careers of Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle and others.  The entire “hipster” scene also arguably owes much of their style to that film.  This week, while being interviewed about the film Irvine Welsh’s Excstasy (which adapts another Welsh book), Welsh revealed who will be starring in an adaptation of his novel Filth.  James McAvoy will play the lead character of a “sex-obsessed, cocaine-addicted, bigoted Scottish police officer who is supposed to be investigating a murder but gets sidetracked by his own peculiarities, worries and hangups ranging from the pranks he pulls on his co-workers to his various sexual conquests.”  Jamie Bell will play his partner/sidekick, and Alan Cumming will play his boss.  Filth will be directed by Jon S. Baird (2008’s Cass), who also adapted the novel.  Filming of Filth is expected to start in Scotland in January, 2012.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#6 REESE WITHERSPOON WILL SEE HER WISH LIST COME TRUE\n\nReese Witherspoon has attached herself to star in a Walt Disney Pictures comedy called Wish List.  Witherspoon will play a woman who 25 years ago as a little girl made ten wishes on a coin at a wishing well, but the coin got stuck without hitting the bottom.  Now, when she’s an adult, the coin finally hits the bottom of the well, and this “ambitious career woman” finds those 10 wishes all coming true at once.  Wish List was originally conceived as a project for a male star, but screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer (cowriter of Mrs. Doubtfire, The Tooth Fairy) is now writing the script to fit Reese Witherspoon.   Wish List is being produced for Disney by Mark Ciardi and Gordon Gray, whose most recent project was Secretariat, also a Disney movie.  Although the premise sounds possibly promising, Wish List is a borderline Rotten Idea because of the very low RT Tomatometer score for The Tooth Fairy.   This week, Reese Witherspoon and Matthew McConaughey were also announced as being in talks to star in Mud, the next movie from indie director Jeff Nichols (Take Shelter, Shotgun Stories), about the friendship between a 14-year-old and a fugitive (McConaughey) on the run from the law.\n\n\n\t\n#5 THE PENGUIN CRAZE CONTINUES WITH DISNEY’S TUX\n\nAlthough the box office results for Mr. Popper’s Penguins may suggest audiences feel differently (or at least they did for that movie), Hollywood continues to have a crush on penguin movies.   Penguins in recent years have been featured in March of the Penguins, Farce of the Penguins, Happy Feet, Surf’s Up and the Madagascar movies (which led to the Nickelodeon series The Penguins of Madagascar).  The penguin madness is already set to continue in Happy Feet 2 and a spin off movie for The Penguins of Madagascar.  Most of these have been family movies, and a studio that has been conspicuously absent from the penguin bandwagon is Walt Disney Pictures.  That changed this week as Disney has acquired the movie rights to the Japanese manga novel  Tuxedo Gin, which the studio will adapt under the title of just Tux.  Tuxedo Gin is the story of a young street fighter who falls into a coma and discovers that he only has enough “karma points” to come back as a penguin, which leads to an adventure of good deeds where he tries to score enough “karma points” so he can return to his body and the girl that he loves.  Robert Ben Garant, cowriter of The Pacifier and the Night at the Museum movies has been hired by Disney to adapt Tuxedo Gin.  It’s position as yet another CGI penguin movie is what lands Tux a spot as one of the week’s most Rotten Ideas. \n\n\t\n#4 ARE CHUCK NORRIS AND JOHN TRAVOLTA EXPENDABLE TOO?\n\nWith Simon West (Con Air, The Mechanic) signed to direct, casting of The Expendables 2 appears to be underway, with a quasi-rumor this week about two actors who might be joining the cast for the sequel.  In an interview, the CEO of the Bulgarian studios where The Expendables 2 will film said that Chuck Norris and John Travolta are expected to costar with the returning cast.  The actors who are expected to return are Sylvester Stallone (obviously), Dolph Lundgren, Mickey Rourke, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham and Bruce Willis (though not Jet Li).   Sylvester Stallone will not be\nwriting this sequel, but his story idea is being adapted by Ken Kaufman (The Missing; cowriter of Space Cowboys) and newcomer David Agusto.  Lionsgate has already scheduled The Expendables 2 for release on August 17, 2012.  This story’s Rotten Idea status mostly comes from the 40% that The Expendables scored on the RT Tomatometer last summer.\n\n\n\t\n#3 NOW YOU SEE ME AND THE BIG WEDDING: TWO MOVIES WITH AMANDA SEYFRIED THAT OTHERWISE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON\n\nSometimes, in this writer’s efforts to fit as many movies as possible into ten stories, movies are lumped together on the admittedly flimsiest of pretenses.  For this entry, the connection is that Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia!, Red Riding Hood) is in both movies.  First up is the action thriller Now You See Me, about a team of FBI agents who find themselves engaged in a game of cat and mouse with a “super team” of the world’s greatest illusionists who are pulling off a series of bank heists during their performances.  Amanda Seyfried and Mark Ruffalo are in talks to join a cast that already includes Jesse Eisenberg and Melanie Laurent.  Louis Leterrier, whose filmography includes The Incredible Hulk, the first two Transporter movies and Clash of the Titans will be helming Now You See Me as well.  Jesse Eisenberg also made the news this week for signing on to star in an independent adaptation of the Fyodor Dostoyevsky novella The Double, in which Eisenberg will play a government office worker who believes he has been replaced by an exact copy of himself.  That particular item just allowed me to sneak in yet another movie to this story.  Going back to Amanda Seyfried, she will also be costarring in the Lionsgate comedy The Big Wedding from director Justin Zackman (The Bucket List).  The Big Wedding is truly star studded, as the cast also includes Robert De Niro, Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, Katherine Heigl, Robin Williams, Topher Grace and Ben Barnes.  In The Big Wedding, Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton play a long divorced couple who have to pretend that they are still happy married at their son’s wedding.  The Double sounds promising, but both Now You See Me and The Big Wedding are just questionable enough to land this as one (actually, two) of the week’s Rotten Ideas.\n\n\t\n#2 ESCAPE FROM PLANET EARTH IS NOT THE ONCE PLANNED SNAKE PLISSKEN SEQUEL\n\nThe Weinstein Company (AKA Bob and Harvey Weinstein) are best known for their decades of producing the movies of filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith and Robert Rodriguez.  However, in recent years, the Weinstein Company has also given us the two Hoodwinked CGI animated fantasy comedies.  This week, the Weinsteins announced their next CGI animated family film called ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"robots, medical, black, demand, spider-man, Diego, Review, book","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Thor-2-Gets-A-Director"},{"id":"47509220704946","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Is Naomie Harris the Next Bond Girl?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Is Naomie Harris the Next Bond Girl?by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 10, 2011 |  CommentsThere are Rotten Ideas in the Ketchup every week, but Hollywood went a little crazy this week, with almost enough major stories (8!) that could have nearly filled the entire column with Rotten Ideas. Sequels (G.I. Joe 2, James Bond 23, Salt 2, TRON 3) and remakes/reboots (Big Man Japan, Cherry 2000, Daredevil, King Kong, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) dominated the week. This writer has seen our cinematic future and it’s very, very familiar.This Week’s Top StoryTHE NEW BOND GIRL MAY HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH PIRATES AND ZOMBIESAs filming proceeds on Peter Jackson’s two movie adaptation of The Hobbit, the other big franchise most halted by MGM’s financial woes is finally getting closer to production. One of the crucial steps on the road to getting a James Bond movie going is the casting of the first Bond Girl, and this week brought exactly that news. British actress Naomie Harris is reportedly in talks to join the dozens of previous actresses who have been Bond Girls. Naomie Harris is best known for costarring in 28 Days Later and as Tia Dalma in the second and third Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Rumors about who might be the villain in this 23rd film have also included Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes and even Sir Anthony Hopkins. British director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) will make his James Bond debut with this film, working from a script from series regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (#23 being their 5th Bond film) and John Logan (Rango, The Aviator). Daniel Craig and Dame Judi Dench will be returning for their third and seventh Bond films, respectively. MGM and Sony Pictures will be codistributing the 23rd James Bond, with a release date currently scheduled for November 9, 2012. Filming is scheduled to start in the fall of 2011, at locations all over the world, including England and India.Fresh Developments This Week#1 20TH CENTURY FOX GOES APE OVER ANIMATED KING KONGThis summer’s franchise reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes is looking (in this writer’s opinion) more promising than anyone could have expected. 20th Century Fox is looking to continue the primate love with the news that Fox Animation is developing a “modern day twist” on King Kong. The animated remake will be from Kong’s perspective, which will be a first for a franchise that has had three major versions (1933, 1976 and 2005) and multiple sequels. Some readers may question why this is a Fresh Development, and the answer to that is in the writers. Although Christian Magalhaes and Bob Snow don’t yet have any produced features to their credit, their screenplay called Murder of a Cat was on the 2010 Black List. Of course, Your Highness was also a Black List script, so…#2 LOST CO-CREATOR HAS A BIG IDEA FOR 1952… WE JUST DON’T KNOW WHAT IT IS YETLOST co-creator and showrunner Damon Lindelof has had a very busy year in the year since the show ended. Lindelof cowrote Cowboys &amp; Aliens, was responsible for the rewrite that led to Prometheus being called something other than an Alien prequel, and is currently cowriting the sequel to J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek reboot. This week, Damon Lindelof made his biggest post-LOST deal yet with Walt Disney Pictures, the parent company of ABC (and therefore, LOST). Lindelof is being paid a 7 figure deal (fairly unusually high for original properties) for an “original large-scale science fiction feature film” with the working title of 1952. That sentence contains just about everything that is currently known about 1952, except that it’s not just being seen as a movie, but also has “multiple platform aspirations,” whatever that actually means (TV? video games? haikus? who knows). Although Disney is saying 1952 is “original,” there remains speculation that 1952 could be somehow connected to LOST. That year didn’t have a direct significance in LOST, unless it’s seen as a prequel to the events set in 1954. The more likely scenario is that 1952 may be an homage by Damon Lindelof of the science fiction and monster movies of that era (although that is just speculation by this writer).#3 HERE’S HOPING SALT 2 IS CALLED PEPPERSony Pictures is moving forward with plans for a sequel to the 2010 Angelina Jolie spy/action film Salt by hiring screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium, Law Abiding Citizen). Wimmer also wrote the original Salt and recently adapted the remake of Total Recall for the same studio. In Salt, Angelina Jolie played a CIA agent who is accused of being a Russian spy assigned the task of assassinating the POTUSA, leading to a series of chase scenes which comprise most of the movie. Salt also ended with a set up that implied her adventures would continue in a sequel. Salt was originally supposed to be called Edwin A. Salt (and star Tom Cruise), but the character’s name was changed to Evelyn Salt when Angelina Jolie was cast instead. Salt opened in July, 2010 to a $36 million domestic weekend that led to a domestic gross of $118 million and a worldwide gross of $295 million. Salt also received an RT Tomatometer score of 62%, earning it a Fresh label (although by a narrow margin), which is why this story is a “Fresh Development” (also by a narrow margin).Rotten Ideas of the Week#6 RIDICULOUS JAPANESE MONSTER MOVIE BIG MAN JAPAN TO BE REMADE AS RIDICULOUS AMERICAN MOVIE, RIDICULOUSLYBig Man Japan was a 2007 Japanese monster movie (released in the USA in 2009) about a man who is able to grow 100 feet tall by absorbing electricity in an ongoing struggle against the various giant monsters that plague Japan. Here’s an example of a fight with a giant tapeworm-ish monster with a comb-over hairstyle which (possibly) isn’t even the weirdest scene in the movie. Columbia Pictures and producer Neil H. Moritz (I Am Legend, the Fast and the Furious franchise) have announced plans for an English-language remake of Big Man Japan. The screenwriting team of Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, who have previously collaborated on Aeon Flux and Clash of the Titans, have been hired to adapt Big Man Japan. Hay and Manfredi also recently worked on the Dark Horse comic book adaptation R.I.P.D., in which Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges will star as undead cops assigned to bring down supernatural menaces. The title of the Big Man Japan remake will probably be changed to reflect the new setting.#5 DISNEY PROCEEDS WITH PLANS FOR TRON 3Walt Disney Pictures has hired screenwriter David DiGilio (Eight Below) to start work on a third movie in the TRON franchise, which they are curiously referring to as a sequel to TRON: Legacy. Last year’s TRON: Legacy was an expensive gamble at an estimated cost of $170 million, but the film has since brought in over $400 million in worldwide grosses for Disney. Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, the writers of TRON: Legacy, had been expected to work on this third film, but they are now busy working on their new ABC TV series Once Upon a Time, which debuts this fall. It’s also unknown if that film’s director, Joseph Kosinski, will return for this third movie. Kosinski is also developing a remake of The Black Hole for Walt Disney Pictures. The decision to proceed with a third TRON movie will reportedly depend at least partially upon the success of the animated TV series TRON: Uprising, which will debut on the Disney XD channel in 2012. This is one of the Rotten Ideas of the week partly based on both the weak RT Tomatometer score for TRON: Legacy (50%). The decision by Disney to hire a screenwriter currently known mostly for a Paul Walker “doggie movie” to adapt something like a TRON sequel was also a factor. Speaking of which…#4 TERMINATOR 5 MAY REWRITE CONTINUITY A LA STAR TREKLast month, Arnold Schwarzenegger postponed his various “return to acting” movie plans following the controversy of his affair (and his familial spin-off project) with his long time live in maid. Oracle heiress and movie producer Megan Ellison, however, had just recently spent quite a bit of cash on acquiring the rights to the Terminator franchise. So, not surprisingly, there are now reportedly plans about how the fifth Terminator movie can be adapted to lessen (or not require at all) Schwarzengger’s involvement. It should also be noted right up front that this story comes from an unconfirmed source, so it does sort of border on “rumor.” If true, Elison and crew’s new plan may be to style the next film after J.J. Abrams’ reboot of Star Trek, going back to the original film’s characters of Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese, with events that would be changed through the miracle of time travel. That’s a handy solution made quite viable through the already existing precedent of time travel in the franchise. Where this story gets its Rotten Idea tag is the suggestion that the new film’s star value may come from Paul Walker, who might be the choice to play the new Kyle Reese. If Paul Walker does take the job, he will be the fourth actor to play Kyle Reese after Michael Biehn (Terminator), Jonathan Jackson (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles) and Anton Yelchin (Terminator: Salvation). Paul Walker would also be reuniting with director Justin Lin, who Walker worked with on Fast &amp; Furious and Fast Five.#3 DWAYNE JOHNSON AS ROADBLOCK IRONICALLY HELPS G.I. JOE SEQUEL GET MADEBack in March, Rachel Nichols (who played Scarlett in G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra) revealed that only three characters would be returning for the sequel: Duke, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. That story was particularly interesting because two of those characters are also mute and wear masks, which suggested that they were chosen to return because they could most easily be recast. Channing Tatum, Ray Park and Lee Byung-hun played those characters in the first film. This week brought the news that Dwayne Johnson is in talks with Paramount Pictures to be the first new cast member, taking on the character of Roadblock, who also appeared in previous cartoon and comic book adaptations of the G.I. Joe toy franchise. Channing Tatum is also in talks to return as Duke. The G.I. Joe sequel will be directed by Jon M. Chu, whose career started with Step Up 2: The Streets and Step Up 3D, and recently included Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, also for Paramount Pictures. The studio is reportedly increasingly interested in getting G.I. Joe 2 produced as a likely summer, 2012 release following recent reports that Star Trek 2 may not be ready in time for its originally projected release in that season. The G.I. Joe sequel is being adapted by the Zombieland screenwriting team of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.#2 THIS WEEK IN GAME-BASED MOVIES: RISK AND ASTEROIDSAlthough the trend’s been relatively dormant lately, Hollywood is still very much pursuing the notion of movies based upon aging non-narrative games of all types. One such example is the Parker Brothers game Risk, in which players compete to control geographic sections of the world map. The lack of a story isn’t stopping Hasbro and Columbia Pictures from moving forward with a Risk movie. This week Columbia hired TV writer John Hlavin to make his feature film debut on adapting Risk. Hlavin has previously worked on seven episodes of television shows like Day Break, LAX, The Shield and Trust Me. There are no details known yet about how exactly Risk will become a full length movie, except that it will be set in the modern day, and take place at locations all around the world. The fun doesn’t stop there, however. Universal Pictures is also moving ahead with one of their video game adaptations that is so old that it might as well be a board game: Asteroids, one of the original Atari arcade hits back in 1979. The director that Universal is currently talking to for Asteroids is Roland Emmerich, who, more than any other modern director, has established his career on a string of big budget disaster movies (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, 2012). Universal Pictures already has a script for Asteroids by screenwriter Matt Lopez, cowriter of The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, Bedtime Stories and Race to Witch Mountain. Roland Emmerich has reportedly imposed on himself a ban from directing any more “end of the world” movies, and the Asteroids script just barely upholds that: it’s set after the end of the world. Totally different. In the Asteroids movie, “the remnants of human civilization are now living on far-flung colonies within an asteroid belt alongside aliens. The survivors were led to believe that this alien civilization was benevolent, rescuing them from doom, but ultimately discover that the aliens have engineered Earth’s destruction, and soon will do the same for the rest of humankind.” That scenario will also undoubtedly feature at least one triangle shaped spaceship that shoots pellets at large asteroids, which will then become medium-sized asteroids, and then finally small asteroids. As for the aliens in the Asteroids movie, there was indeed a UFO that would fly by every so often in the game, so Universal can’t be accused of not being faithful to the source material.#1 THIS WEEK IN REMAKE/REBOOT NEWS: DAREDEVIL, WEREWOLF, TMNT, AND… CHERRY 2000?Wow, when Hollywood gets in the mood to unleash rotten news, they don’t hold back. Normally, the Weekly Ketchup has ten stories each week, but there were so many remake/reboot stories this week, that (along with Rotten #2), this column actually covers 14 stories, 8 of which are Rotten Ideas. Fasten your seatbelts (well, no, you shouldn’t be driving while reading this), because here we go. 20th Century Fox has hired TV writer Brad Caleb Kane, who has written three episodes of FOX’s Fringe, to work on their reboot of the Marvel Comics character Daredevil. The reboot will be an adaptation of the Born Again storyline written by Frank Miller, in which the Kingpin uses his knowledge of blind attorney Matt Murdock’s identity to ruin his entire life. That part would be fresh. That the new Daredevil is still to be directed by David Slade (30 Days of Night, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse), not so much. Brad Caleb Kane has also worked on DreamWorks’ movie based upon the View-Master toy, director Bill Condon’s planned Richard Pryor biopic, and a vampire movie called The Historian. Next up is yet another reboot of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, just four years after the previous reboot of TNMT in 2007. The previous movies were distributed by New Line Cinema and then Warner Bros (the 2007 reboot), but this latest version is from Paramount Pictures. Paramount has hired screenwriters Josh Applebaum and Andre Nemec to work on the next live action reboot of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, following their work on the upcoming Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol. Next up is Universal Pictures, and a rumor/report that the studio has changed up its plans for a possible sequel to The Wolfman to another lycanthrope reboot that will instead be called Werewolf. Newcomer Michael Tabb was the writer originally working on the sequel, and he is reportedly now also adapting his script to be an original film instead. Finally, there is Cherry 2000, the 1987 science fiction film starring Melanie Griffith and Pamela Gidley, who played a “pleasure model” robot in the distant future of 2017. Producer Ed Pressman, who is also working on remakes of movies like Bloodsport and The Crow, is reportedly considering a Cherry 2000 remake as well. Melanie Griffith has already spoken to Pressman about the remake, and has suggested to him that it might be a good movie for Dakota Johnson, Griffith’s daughter with Don Johnson, who had supporting roles in Beastly and The Social Network. Ah, the circle of life.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"jurassic, Photos, BBC, sag, Marvel, National, Teen, Film, Studios, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Is-Naomie-Harris-the-Next-Bond-Girl"},{"id":"47509219206828","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Live Action Captain Planet in the Works","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Live Action Captain Planet in the WorksPlus, several Robert Rodriguez projects, a new Spielberg movie, and Voltron.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 22, 2011 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup comes to you right in the middle of San Diego Comic-Con, 2011, and already it’s been a news packed seven days (much of the news actually comes out before the Con). The Weekly Ketchup is normally just 10 stories, but to avoid missing too many items of interest, this week, over twice as many stories are presented to you, sometimes three, four or five at a time under each headline. And Comic-Con isn’t even halfway over as we’re posting this!This Week’s Top StoryCAPTAIN PLANET MAKING THE WORLD SAFE FOR BLUE-SKINNED GUYS WITH MULLETSCartoon Network has signed a deal with Transformers producer Don Murphy to start development of a live action adaptation of the 1990s animated superhero TV show Captain Planet. In the series, which ran for six seasons, Gaia (AKA Mother Earth) brings together five youngsters who gain powers representing the four classic elements (air, earth, wind and water), along with a completely made up element, heart. When the Planeteers perform a ritual, they are able to summon Captain Planet, a blue-skinned male superhero with a green mullet. Captain Planet and the Planeteers fought a series of Eco Villains who represented all the different ways humans generally make life on Earth a bit less clean and safe. Murphy’s coproducer partner Susan Montford said, “With the earthquakes, tornadoes, melting icebergs and all the other problems threatening the world right now, Earth really needs her greatest defender,” which is a bit odd since at least one of those things (earthquakes) seems to be something Earth just does without any evil human interference. Captain Planet and Captain America: The First Avenger got another competitor this week with the news of a movie based on the indie Canadian superhero Captain Canuck. Minds Eye Entertainment is a Canadian production company whose releases mostly go direct-to-video in the USA, such as the 2009 Stephen King adaptation Dolan’s Cadillac, starring Christian Slater. And that leads us to the latest news from Hugh Jackman about The Wolverine (who is arguably the real “most famous Canadian superhero”), who confirmed at Comic-Con that the Silver Samurai will indeed be the main villain in the next Japan-set film. Drawing a line from Captain Planet to Captain Canuck to The Wolverine is an example of how this week’s crowded plethora of news items are being presented to you in just ten actual stories.Fresh Developments This Week#1 ROBERT RODRIGUEZ USES COMIC-CON TO ANNOUNCE A DECADE’S WORTH OF AMBITIOUS MOVIESSome directors regularly associate themselves with more movie projects than it seems possible for them to actually do within the scope of say, a decade or so. Robert Rodriguez is one such director, but the difference between him and many others is that he directs many more films than some of his contemporaries, thanks to having his own production studio in Austin, Texas. Yesterday, Rodriguez took to the massive Hall H to make a series of announcements that included sequels to Machete and Sin City, as well as remakes of Fire and Ice and Heavy Metal. The ending of Machete revealed titles for two sequels, with the next one being Machete Kills. Rodriguez has now revealed that the third project, which will get its start as a trailer attached to Machete Kills, will be called Machete Kills Again… In Space! This third film will “include space babes and a lightsaber style weapon.” Although it feels like Rodriguez has been saying this for several years now, the director also said that Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For could start filming “as early as later this year.” In addition to adapting the Sin City trade paperback of that title, the movie will feature two new stories written by Frank Miller, one of which will be called The Long Bad Night. And now, for the remakes. Robert Rodriguez is teaming up with the estate of fantasy artist/painter Frank Frazetta to produce a live action remake of the 1983 sword and sorcery film Fire and Ice from animation director Ralph Bakshi. Finally, Rodriguez also wants to make a new Heavy Metal movie, and he is looking for story ideas from fans, who can submit their concepts to this website established for just that purpose: http://www.badassdigest.com/heavymetal.#2 HERMIONE AND THE BEASTWhile promoting Crazy, Stupid Love, producer Denise Di Novi revealed that one of her latest projects is a new version of Beauty and the Beast. Di Novi is coproducing the adaptation of the French fairy tale La Belle et la Bete with Guillermo del Toro. Emma Watson, AKA Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movies, is already attached to star as the titular Beauty. There’s no word yet as to whether Guillermo del Toro is considering Beauty and the Beast as a potential directing project, or if he will just be producing. Del Toro’s next film as director will be the giant monster invasion movie Pacific Rim. A connection that Guillermo del Toro has to Beauty and the Beast is that the actor who played the Beast in the 1987-1989 CBS TV show was Ron Perlman, who went on to work with del Toro on Cronos, Blade II and the two Hellboy movies.#3 STEVEN SPIELBERG’S FORECAST INCLUDES A STEADY RAINThe increasing number of A list stars that show up at San Diego Comic-Con means that not necessarily all of the news that comes out this week in July is limited to fanboy-related adaptations. While there to promote Real Steel, Hugh Jackman mentioned a Broadway adaptation that Steven Spielberg is looking to add to his slate, after directing the upcoming films War Horse, The Aventures of Tintin, and Lincoln. In 2009, Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig starred in a 12 week Broadway staging of the Keith Huff play A Steady Rain. In a plot reminiscent of the true story of Jeffrey Dahmer, A Steady Rain depicts two Chicago police officers who discover that they returned a Vietnamese boy to a cannibal serial killer pretending to be his uncle, who then went on to make the boy his next victim. Regardless, Hugh Jackman has said that a writer is currently working on adapting A Steady Rain. It is also likely that Spielberg’s plan involves recruiting Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman (which is probably how he knew about it) to reprise their performances in this film. What is unclear is whether A Steady Rain will be a directorial project for Steven Spielberg, or just something he will produce. That stark scenario seems like quite a departure from the tone Spielberg is normally known for, and the famed director has also mostly avoided the crime story genre.#4 SHIA LABEOUF AND ROBERT REDFORD ARE THE COMPANY YOU KEEPPossibly hoping to stand out amidst all the genre fare announced at Comic-Con, some producers with very different projects tip their hat this week as well. Shia LaBeouf and Robert Redford have signed to star in an independent adaptation of the 2003 Neil Gordon novel The Company You Keep, which Redford (Ordinary People, Quiz Show, The Legend of Bagger Vance) will also direct. Told through a series of e-mails (in the novel, at least), The Company You Keep is the story of one of the last Vietnam era fugitives (Redford) still wanted for a 1974 crime who encounters a young reporter (LaBeouf) who wants his story, which leads them on a road trip across America as the former anti-war radical rediscovers his past. Screenwriter Lem Dobbs (The Limey; cowriter of Dark City, The Score) is currently working on adapting the novel.#5 SAMUEL L. JACKSON PRESENTS: AFRO SAMURAI… IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLICSamuel L. Jackson, the Indomina Group, and Gonzo Studios are teaming up to give the world a live action movie adaptation of Afro Samurai. Afro Samurai started as a manga book series, and has since branched into television and video games. Afro Samurai is set in a futuristic Japan that has also returned to being a feudal state, and tells the story of a swordmaster who is seeking revenge for the death of his father when he was a child. Gonzo Studios is the animation studio behind the 5 episode anime TV show based on the character, Samuel L. Jackson voiced the character on that show (and the movie Afro Samurai: Resurrection), and the Indomina Group is “the fast-growing U.S. and Dominican Republic based producer and distributor of film.” Despite his previous work on the character, Samuel L. Jackson is not expected to star as Afro in the live action version, other than his role as producer. Indomina Studios plans to find a director and writer this summer, finish casting by the end of 2011, and start filming Afro Samurai in the Dominican Republic sometime in 2012. That is sort of a fast pre-production schedule, but it’s not impossible. One of Jackson’s next films as an actor will be Quentin Tarantino’s slavery era Spaghetti Western Django Unchained, in which Jackson will play a house slave. This week, Kevin Costner was cast as Ace Woody, “the sadistic trainer of the male fighting slaves who entertain the white patrons of Candyland as well as the female slaves who are forced to be prostitutes.” Costner joins the already cast Jackson, Leonardo DiCaprio as the evil slave owner Calvin Candie, Jamie Foxx as the title character, and Christoph Waltz as the man who trains Django in the skills of a bounty hunter. This is the second high profile film that Kevin Costner has landed a supporting role in lately, following his casting as Jonathan Kent in Man of Steel.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 300 COWRITER REVIVING SPARTACUSThis week, relatively new production company GK Films announced plans for a historical epic based on the life of Spartacus, the leader of a slave rebellion against the Roman Republic in the first century B.C. The story of Spartacus was previously adapted in 1960 as a film directed by Stanley Kubrick, and starring Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, Laurence Olivier and Peter Ustinov. The Starz network also airs a series called Spartacus: Blood and Sand (and Spartacus: Vengeance) which focuses more on the gladiator aspect of the Spartacus story. The GK Films project will be written by 300 cowriter Michael B. Moore (he also had a story credit on G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra). To distinguish this movie from Kubrick’s Spartacus, an emphasis will be placed on the historical facts of the slave rebellion, so that it will not be a remake of Kubrick’s film. GK Films’ previous productions include Edge of Darkness, Rango, The Tourist and the Starz series Camelot. GK Films’ upcoming projects include Dark Shadows, The Rum Diary and the Martin Scorsese missionary epic Silence.#3 THE VOLTRON MOVIE STEPS RIGHT OVER THE MAJOR STUDIOSLast September, it was revealed via three leaked concept art images that Atlas Entertainment (Get Smart, The Brothers Grimm) had acquired the rights to the Japanese anime TV series and toy line Voltron. Voltron is of course about five young pilots who each control a different massive robot lion, which can then come together to form an even more massive humanoid robot. And then they have adventures. Yesterday, the Voltron live action movie got a little bit closer to actually happening, as Relativity Media has picked up the rights from Atlas Entertainment. Relativity Media started as a production company, but has since 2010 branched into distribution as well, releasing such films as Let Me In, Season of the Witch, Limitless and Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer. The live action Voltron project represents the most ambitious movie for Relativity Media to date.#2 THIS STORY MENTIONS HILARY SWANK AND FOUR OTHER RANDOM COMIC BOOK MOVIES ANNOUNCED AT SDCCAnd this is the part where several new comic book movie projects will get dumped as quickly as possible, just to make sure they get some mention. These are listed in the Rotten Idea category somewhat cynically; it’s possible some of these could be great, but most of them… probably won’t be (or even get made at all). Hilary Swank will produce and star in an adaptation of the Radical Comics title Shrapnel. Newcomer screenwriter Toby Wagstaff will adapt the story of a former military officer (Swank) who leads a revolt on the planet Venus in the year 2250. After years of development at Dimension Films, the Top Cow comic book The Darkness found new life this week with Mandeville Films (The Fighter, The Muppets) acquiring the rights to the supernatural crimefighter franchise, which has also inspired two video games (one of them upcoming). The late 1980s Marvel Comics science fiction series Strikeforce: Morituri is also getting developed as a movie. This project in particular is not really that surprising considering that its “alien invasion” concept is one of the most popular recent trends in movies. A comic book-turned-potential movie that is a bit more esoteric is The Red Star, which is now being developed by Warner Bros after being put into turnaround by Universal Pictures. The Red Star is set in an alternate reality version of the Soviet Union where magic and technology are both commonly used in a war in which ghosts fight alongside human soldiers. Neal Moritz, the producer behind the Fast and the Furious and xXx franchises, is producing The Red Star. Finally, 20th Century Fox is developing an adaptation of the indie comic book Rust, about a boy whose jetpack crash lands him on a farm, while he’s still being pursued by an old war robot. That premise actually sounds pretty cool, but it’s more difficult to imagine how it will be adapted by screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (27 Dresses, Morning Glory), whose next two films in theaters will be I Don’t Know How She Does It and We Bought a Zoo. The thematic connection to an adventure involving robots and jetpacks… not seeing it.#1 UNIVERSAL PICTURES WON’T SCALE THE DARK TOWERThe writing may have been on the wall after Universal Studios delayed pre-production back in May, but this week, the studio backed out from developing Ron Howard’s ambitious plans for Stephen King’s The Dark Tower series. What Howard and Imagine Entertainment were hoping for was a plan that included three movies and two limited run TV series that cover what the movies don’t. Universal came back with an offer to greenlight just one movie, and that pretty much led to the two sides parting ways, with Ron Howard and Imagine now free to shop their concept elsewhere. Universal has a corporate cousin in NBC, but other studios have similar TV connections (Disney and ABC, Fox and Fox, etc), so there is still hope for The Dark Tower. However, this delay may mean Javier Bardem (who was signed to star as Roland Deschain) might not be available when and if The Dark Tower ever gets going again. This is the Week’s most Rotten Idea, particularly for all of the fans who were so excited that the book series might get an ambitious depiction on a grand scale. Ron Howard’s career, however, continued on in another direction this week, as he has signed with Warner Bros to direct a planned adaptation of the non-fiction book Under the Banner of Heaven by Jon Krakauer, whose book Into the Wild also became a film. Dustin Lance Black (Milk and the upcoming J. Edgar biopic) is adapting the true story of two brothers who followed an extreme fundamental sect of Mormonism and claimed that they murdered their younger brother’s wife and infant daughter on orders from God. As with Steven Spielberg and A Steady Rain, Ron Howard appears to be going into darker territory with Under the Banner of Heaven than the tone he is generally associated with.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"camera, ratings, of, what, Country, Spike, review, streaming, Showtime, movie, BAFTA, Paquin, Films, doctor","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Live-Action-Captain-Planet-in-the-Works"},{"id":"47509219207853","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Spike Lee Reprises Do the Right Thing Role","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Spike Lee Reprises Do the Right Thing RoleAlso, news on remakes of Godzilla and Evil Dead, and Ahnuld is back.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 15, 2011 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup features news stories about new entries in the Godzilla, Evil Dead, G.I. Joe and Bourne franchises, as well as new roles for Johnny Depp, Edward Norton, Jennifer Lopez and Arnold Schwarzenegger.This Week’s Top StorySPIKE LEE RETURNS TO BROOKLYN AS MOOKIE FROM DO THE RIGHT THINGAs this writer compiles the Weekly Ketchup each Friday, sometimes it seems like many movie websites overlook some of the biggest stories. This one is definitely in that category. While many sites continued to cover last week’s news about Spike Lee’s involvement with the English language remake of South Korean thriller Oldboy, a potentially much bigger story didn’t even always get a mention. Spike Lee has started filming an independent movie called Red Hook Summer in Brooklyn, NY and in addition to directing, he’s also acting… as Mookie from Do the Right Thing. That’s right, Red Hook Summer appears to be a de facto sequel to the film that many consider to be not just Spike Lee’s best film, but arguably one of the best films of the 1980s. Red Hook Summer is described as a story about an Atlanta man spending the summer in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is also home to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood (AKA Bed-Stuy) depicted in Lee’s controversial 1989 drama. Spike Lee directed, wrote, produced and starred in Do the Right Thing as Mookie, a young pizza delivery man caught in the middle of a racial incident at Sal’s Pizzaria (where he works). That’s one way to describe Do the Right Thing, but the reason it’s considered a modern classic is that the film succeeds even without the socio-political elements. So, the question now is whether Red Hook Summer has what it takes to live up to the promise of being an implied Do the Right Thing sequel/spin off/whatever-it-is? There’s also no word yet as to whether other Do the Right Thing costars will also be returning (such as, say, Samuel L. Jackson, John Turturro, Rosie Perez or Martin Lawrence).Fresh Developments This Week#1 JOHNNY DEPP’S PRODUCING NIGHT STALKER AND PAUL REVERE MOVIESWalt Disney Pictures is looking to keep their Jack Sparrow in-house by aligning with Johnny Depp’s Infinitum Nihil production company on two ambitious movie projects that Depp is likely to star in. The two projects are a big screen adaptation of the classic (but short lived) 1970s supernatural thriller TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker and a historical drama about Paul Revere’s Midnight Ride. The Night Stalker project is described as an adaptation of the original 1972 TV movie that led to the reporter character of Carl Kolchak (as played by Darren McGavin) getting his own TV show. Kolchak: The Night Stalker featured a different supernatural-themed investigation every week, but that TV movie’s story was all about a serial killer that Kolchak suspects might actually be a real vampire. If Depp’s Night Stalker sticks with that story, it can be seen as something of a follow up to the Dark Shadows movie (also based on an early 1970s cult hit TV show) in which Depp is playing the vampire Barnabas Collins (directed by Tim Burton… of course). As for the Paul Revere project, the movie is expected to focus on the 24 hour period in April, 1775, during which Boston silversmith Paul Revere made his ride from Charlestown to Lexington to warn the provincial congress (and all other Revolutionary forces he met along the way) of the incoming British advance. Johnny Depp and his coproducer are currently looking for screenwriters to work on both projects.#2 HAWKEYE AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK FACE OFF IN THE BOURNE LEGACYIt’s been known for a while that Jeremy Renner will be following up his role as Hawkeye in The Avengers with yet another franchise entry: The Bourne Legacy. Rather than playing Matt Damon’s role of Jason Bourne, Jeremy Renner will be playing another government assassin trained by a department even more nefarious and dangerous than Bourne’s. It?s been known for a while that Rachel Weisz will be playing the new agent’s love interest. This week, however, brought news of who is in talks for the role of the film’s villain, and it’s Edward Norton. If Norton signs, The Bourne Legacy will potentially be the answer to a future trivia contest. Before Jeremy Renner signed on to play Hawkeye in The Avengers, Edward Norton was at one time expected to reprise the role of Dr. Bruce Banner from The Incredible Hulk. The Hulk production was the focus of many media stories involving the script, which Edward Norton reportedly rewrote (although he wasn?t credited by the WGA in the end). We may never know the exact answer to how it happened, but Mark Ruffalo was eventually cast as Banner/Hulk instead of Edward Norton. Anyway, back to The Bourne Legacy, Tony Gilroy (Duplicity, Michael Clayton), who also cowrote the first three Bourne movies, will be directing the fourth movie this fall for Universal Pictures, from a script he cowrote with his brother Dan Gilroy (Two for the Money; cowriter of The Fall).#3 EVIL DEAD 4 IS FINALLY, REALLY, ACTUALLY HAPPENINGFor horror fans, there may have been really only one news item worth even mentioning this week. It started with a tweet from actor Bruce Campbell, “Believe in the remake, dawg!” The remake Campbell was talking about is the movie that has sometimes been called Evil Dead 4. The news that pre-production is starting in Detroit ends an 18 year wait that began the day after Army of Darkness came out in 1993. Sam Raimi is handing the directing job off to young Uruguayan filmmaker Fede Alvarez, for whom Evil Dead 4 (or whatever it’s eventually called) will be his feature debut, following a couple of shorts including one called Panic Attack!. Fede Alvarez also cowrote the remake script with his Panic Attack! cowriter Rodo Sayagues. However, their script is now getting another rewrite from a surprise source: Academy Award winner Diablo Cody (Juno, Jennifer’s Body). Although no plot details are known yet, as a remake, we can guess that it will probably be about someone finding a book called the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis in a remote cabin, which then leads to the unleashing of “deadites,” which are reanimated body parts and corpses possessed by evil spirits. The original Evil Dead producing team of Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell are all shepherding the project through Ghost House Pictures, and Lionsgate is handling international sales for the film’s eventual release. There’s also a strong chance that Bruce Campbell will appear in the remake in some form, although it’s not yet known if he will be playing Ash, or some other character. Finally, you can click here to see the short film Panic Attack! that inspired Raimi, Tapert and Campbell to entrust Alvarez with their most cherished horror franchise. There’s no animated deer heads, but it’s still pretty cool.#4 HOLLYWOOD SCREENWRITER’S BIG THREE ARE THE DARK KNIGHT, MAN OF STEEL AND… GODZILLAScreenwriter David Goyer may have started with movies like Kickboxer 2: The Road Back, Demonic Toys and the TV movie Nick Fury: Agent of Shield, but he really did work his way up to the big time. Later on, he worked on movies like Dark City and the three Blade movies, and today he is working with director and producer Christopher Nolan on The Dark Knight Rises and Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel. Batman and Superman are obviously larger-than-life characters, but Goyer’s next movie has them beat, handily. He has signed with Legendary Pictures (the studio also behind those superhero franchises) and Warner Bros to do a rewrite of the reboot of Godzilla. Screenwriter David Callaham (cowriter of Doom, The Expendables) wrote the first draft, which David Goyer will now rewrite. Movie fans understandably may have bad vibes about Godzilla, following the critically-panned disaster of a movie that was the 1998 Godzilla. However, this new Godzilla relaunch project is expected to have nothing in common with that film except a title and a coproduction credit with Toho, the Japanese company behind the classic monster franchise. Normally, this might be the part where I explain what Godzilla is about, but really, if I have to do that… you’re reading the wrong column. Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros hope to have Godzilla ready to stomp back into theaters possibly as soon as 2013.#5 MICHAEL CHIKLIS AND JENNIFER LOPEZ MAY JOIN JASON STATHAM IN PARKERParker is the name of the latest movie based upon the criminal anti-hero character created by author Donald E. Westlake in a series of novels. Previous movies based on the character (but frequently with a different name) include Point Blank, The Outfit and Payback. It has been known for a while that Parker will be directed by Taylor Hackford (Ray, An Officer and a Gentleman, The Devil’s Advocate). However, enough casting news has happened since Parker was last mentioned in this column that it’s definitely time for an update. First off, the role of Parker himself will be played by Jason Statham, star of the Transporter and Crank franchises. Jennifer Lopez recently started negotiations to play Parker’s love interest. And this week, Michael Chiklis, AKA Vic Mackey from The Shield, signed on to play Parker’s nemesis. Although the nature of Chiklis’ character isn’t precisely known yet, many online fans this week have expressed hope that this will be an opportunity for Chiklis to flex his tougher, meaner acting muscles. Filming of Parker starts in New Orleans next month.#6 ERIC NORTHMAN FROM TRUE BLOOD STICKING WITH THE VIKING THINGSome actors have a niche, and they just stick with what gets them steady work. It’s such an obvious fact that it’s probably not even worth mentioning. Consider Alexander Skarsgard, who plays Eric Northman, the former Viking vampire in HBO’s True Blood, for example. When Thor was casting up, there was a good while when Skarsgard was in the running, and was considered by many fans to be the obvious choice, because, really, who else could Marvel possibly cast? When the guy who played Kirk’s dad in Star Trek got the role instead, many people were frankly dumbfounded. People thought “Norse” and “blonde” and “tall,” and Alexander Skarsgard seemed like almost the only choice (sorry, Tyler Mane!). That notion stuck around when his dad was cast in Thor, and he wasn’t. Well, Alexander Skarsgard’s big screen Viking ship came in this week with the news that he is attached to star in and produce a Warner Bros “epic” with the working title of The Vanguard. Skarsgard will play one of two Viking brothers who are banished to North America, and so they must spend the rest of the movie attempting to get back home to Sweden (Skarsgard is himself Swedish). Screenwriter Chris Boal, who doesn’t yet have any produced movies to his credit, is working on the script. This was a big week for Chris Boal, because he also signed another deal with Warner Bros to work on an untitled ancient war epic about Roman general Gaius Julius Caesar, who went on to become Rome’s first, you know… Caesar. Warner Bros is seeing the project as a two movie franchise with the first movie ending with Caesar taking control of Rome, and the second movie would address the rest of his life (Cleopatra, “Et Tu, Brutus?”, etc). Jonathan Liebesman (Battle: Los Angeles, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning), who is also directing the Clash of the Titans sequel for Warner Bros, is attached to direct the first Julius Caesar movie.Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER’S WILL-HE-WON’T-HE RETURN TO MOVIES DRAMA ENDS WITH THE LAST STANDThe year 2011 has seen Arnold Schwarzenegger at the center of a rollercoaster ride revolving around the question of how he will make his return to movies after several years as the Governor of California. The year started with several different projects being mentioned, including a possible movie based upon a planned animated TV series called The Governator (in which he would have played a superhero who fights crime alongside Maria Shriver and their four kids). However, that was all before Schwarzenegger’s extramarital misadventures were made public in May, which very quickly led to Schwarzenegger announcing that he was putting his acting career on hold. Just two months was apparently long enough for Schwarzenegger to recover, because this week Lionsgate announced that the Austrian Oak will indeed make his return in The Last Stand. Schwarzenegger will play ex-LAPD officer Sheriff Owens, whose sleepy border town surprisingly becomes the last line of defense against a fugitive drug kingpin who is speeding towards Mexico with a car full of hostages and violent gang members. The Last Stand will also mark the English language debut of Korean thriller director Kim Jee-Woon (I Saw the Devil, A Tale of Two Sisters). This story is Rotten for other reasons, too, but the clincher was a comment from Kim Jee-Woon, which seems to be trying a bit too hard to draw a connection to one of the best action films of all time. Here’s what he had to say, “[It’s] kind of a combination of Die Hard and High Noon where (the latter) was about protecting something very important that needs to be protected, while Die Hard is a very drawn-out, long process that almost kills someone in the process. So my film will be something that has to be very well protected and, in the process, we almost die protecting it in a way.”#2 RAY STEVENSON TO BE VILLAINOUS AS FIREFLY IN G.I. JOE 2Ray Stevenson is one of those fan favorite actors who unfortunately also frequently signs on for movies that he seems too good for. Stevenson arguably made his reputation playing Titus Pullo on the HBO series Rome, and his filmography also includes roles in King Arthur, The Book of Eli, The Other Guys, The Vampire’s Assistant, Thor (as Volstagg) and of course, as the third Punisher star in Punisher: War Zone. His next movie role will be Porthos in this fall’s The Three Musketeers, directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (the Resident Evil guy, not the Boogie Nights guy). This week, Stevenson added yet another potentially disappointing movie to his filmography by signing with Paramount to play the villain Firefly in G.I. Joe 2: Cobra Strikes. Like returning characters Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, Firefly is described as a “ninja master,” as well as an expert saboteur. Channing Tatum (Duke), Ray Park (Snake Eyes) and Lee Byung-hun (Storm Shadow) are the only cast members expected to return. In addition to Ray Stevenson, the other new cast members revealed thus far include D.J. Cotrona (Flint), Dwayne Johnson (Roadblock), Adrianne Palicki (Lady Jaye), RZA (Blind Master) and Elodie Yung (Jinx). Director Jon M. Chu (Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, Step Up 2: The Streets, Step Up 3D) will start filming G.I. Joe 2: Cobra Strikes later this summer, from a script by the Zombieland team of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. Paramount Pictures has scheduled G.I. Joe 2: Cobra Strikes for release in August, 2012.#1 THE AKIRA REMAKE MAY GET AN UNKNOWN DIRECTORBack in May, Albert Hughes, codirector of The Book of Eli, From Hell and Menace II Society with his brother Allen, dropped out of Warner Bros’ planned live-action adaptation of the manga series Akira. Now, Warner Bros is in talks with director Jaume Collet-Serra (Unknown, Orphan) to take on the adaptation instead. Movie fans probably best know Akira as the basis for the 1988 anime film of the same title, which regularly tops critics’ lists as either the best, or one of the best, anime films of all time. Akira tells the story of two teenage motorcycle gang members who become involved with a secret government experiment that causes one of them to become a super-powered mutant with catastrophic mental abilities. The project has been the subject of much fan outrage for a variety of reasons. One issue is the idea of adult actors like Keanu Reeves, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ryan Gosling being considered. Besides age, there’s also the question of Akira being Anglicized, with the setting changed from Neo Tokyo to Neo Manhattan. Besides all that, there’s the very idea of doing a de facto live action remake of Akira at all. Specific to this news, there’s also Jaume Collet-Serra’s Tomatometer record to consider, which is entirely rated “Rotten,” with his best reviewed film (Unknown) only getting a Tomatometer score of 56%. For so many reasons, Warner Bros’ continued efforts for a live action Akira movie is the week’s most Rotten Idea.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"obituary, The, Polls, Election, Sundance, Originals, horror, 99%, and, Epix, Superheroe","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Spike-Lee-Reprises-Do-the-Right-Thing-Role"},{"id":"47509220705971","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Hangover Part III Already in the Works","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Hangover Part III Already in the WorksPlus,by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 3, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes tons of news for The Hangover star Bradley Cooper and others, news of biopics based on the lives of Jackie Robinson and Elizabeth Taylor, and a few comic book movies that include Hawkman.This Week’s Top StoryWARNER BROS. SURPRISES NO ONE AND STARTS WORK ON THE HANGOVER PART IIIThis past Memorial Day weekend, The Hangover Part II broke all sorts of box office weekends with $205 million worldwide in just five days, including the biggest opening ever for a comedy. So, it should surprise no one that Warner Bros has hired one of that film’s screenwriters to start work on The Hangover Part III, which is being seen as the final film in what will end up being a trilogy. Craig Mazin didn’t work on the original movie, but his other credits include Superhero Movie (which he has sole credit on) and cowriting duties on Senseless, Scary Movie 3 and Scary Movie 4. There’s no firm confirmation on where the “Wolf Pack” will head next, but the popular consensus among the cast appears to be Amsterdam, which sort of completes a “party city” trifecta that began with Las Vegas and Bangkok. Craig Mazin also revealed this week his idea for how The Hangover Part III might end (though he might have been joking): “I think the third movie ends with Doug staring at a row of crosses in a graveyard. It’s everyone ? his wife, his family is dead, everybody from the first movie is dead. Somebody shows up and tells him his dog is dead.” The “Doug” that Mazin refers to is the character played by Justin Bartha who is mostly absent from the crazy events of the first two movies. The next step for Warner Bros will be to secure stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis (who are believed to have only been signed for one sequel), as well as director Todd Phillips.Fresh Developments This Week#1 CASTING RUMORS FOR QUENTIN TARANTINO’S LATEST ARE LOOSE AND UNCHAINEDTwitter’s 140 character limit is a pox on anyone who wants details in their news scoops. This week, Tweets were twice aflutter about Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained, about a slave who seeks revenge against his former Southern master. Normally, the Weekly Ketchup doesn’t repost rumors too often, but directors and movies like Quentin Tarantino and Django Unchained are special exceptions. First, there was a tweet from blogger Jeff Goldsmith (formerly of Creative Screenwriting magazine) announcing, “Leonardo DiCaprio WILL play villian Calvin Candie in Tarantino?s Django Unchained! QT wanted him for I.B. &amp; now has him!” The I.B. that Goldsmith is referring to is, of course, Inglourious Basterds, which DiCaprio was at one time in talks to costar in. It should be noted that, as of this writing, nothing official has come out, so for now, the idea that Leonardo DiCaprio will play the villainous slave owner is just a rumor. Also in the rumor category, thanks to Twitter, is the idea that Idris Elba (Stringer Bell in The Wire, Heimdall in Thor) might be in talks to star as Django after Will Smith possibly dropping out (he was never officially signed). Elba’s possible involvement is even murkier than DiCaprio’s, as the idea just comes from Elba tweeting that he was “Having one of the biggest meetings of my professional life today… meeting a very controversial director for a very controversial part.” People took that to mean Quentin Tarantino and Django Unchained, but really, he could have been talking about any controversial director. Uwe Boll’s pretty controversial, for example.#2 ELIZABETH TAYLOR AND RICHARD BURTON’S FURIOUS LOVE RAGES ONBiopic movie projects have a funny way of popping up not too long after their subject’s demise. Such was the case this week with Elizabeth Taylor, just over two months after her departing on March 23, 2011. The subject at hand is the book Furious Love by Sam Kashner and Nancy Schoenberger about the tumultuous romance between 1950s-1960s movie stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, which resulted in Burton being two of Taylor’s eight marriages (#5 and #6). After long negotiations with many other parties, Paramount Pictures has finalized a deal for Furious Love that sets the romantic real life epic up as a directorial project for Martin Scorsese. Screenwriter David Seidler (The King’s Speech) and actress Natalie Portman were among those who had also been trying to secure the rights, which gives us an idea of at least one actress who wants to play Elizabeth Taylor. To be clear, the use of the word “biopic” is slightly off, as Furious Love would not be a full biopic, but would focus on the years of the Taylor/Burton on-and-off-and-on-again romance, starting with the filming of Cleopatra in 1963 until their second divorce in 1976. As for Martin Scorsese directing Furious Love, the movie is likely going to have to wait a few years, as Scorsese has a full plate which includes the upcoming Hugo Cabret, his Five Obstructions project with Lars von Trier (which may be an artsy remake of Taxi Driver), the missionary priest epic Silence, and his plans for another biopic about the life of crooner Frank Sinatra. Furious Love will need that extra time anyway, as the next step for Paramount is to find a screenwriter for the project.#3 HERE’S AN UNEXPECTED REMAKE: THE JACKIE ROBINSON STORYLegendary Pictures is the high profile Warner Bros-based production company most associated with big budget special effects movies like 300, Watchmen, Inception, Clash of the Titans and Christopher Nolan’s three Batman movies. Legendary also produced the two Hangover movies, and a few other less expensive movies like The Town and Observe and Report, and this news item is another project more in that budget range. Legendary Pictures has made a deal with the estate of Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson, who broke the league’s “color line” as a second baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Jackie Robinson himself starred in the 1950 movie The Jackie Robinson Story. There have been other efforts in recent years to get another Jackie Robinson movie made, including one by Spike Lee (which would have starred Denzel Washington), and a project which would star Robert Redford as Branch Rickey, the Dodgers executive who signed Robinson. With the deal with Robinson’s estate, however, Legendary Pictures has the best chance of actually getting their project produced. Legendary has already hired Brian Helgeland to both write and direct the Jackie Robinson biopic. Helgeland’s resume as director includes Payback and A Knight’s Tale, and as screenwriter, Helgeland has also worked on Mystic River, Man on Fire and L.A. Confidential (cowritten with director Curtis Hanson).#4 POP CULTURE SPOOFERS PENNY ARCADE GO TO THE MOVIES WITH THE NEW KIDThe webcomic Penny Arcade has been joking about video games and other pop culture subjects since 1998. Now, thanks to a one shot webcomic called The New Kid (that was a grand total of just 6 panels), the guys behind Penny Arcade are getting into the movie business. Paramount Pictures has acquired the rights to The New Kid to adapt it into an animated film about a kid who is the only human in an outer space school full of aliens. The New Kid is the first step in a new animation launch that follows Rango, the studio’s first recent non-DreamWorks Animation release (not counting the many previous Paramount animated movies like those with Nickelodeon, etc). Paramount Pictures this week also acquired the rights to the DC Comics title The Mighty, which is particularly interesting because DC Comics movie adaptations are usually produced and distributed by Warner Bros. However, in the case of The Mighty, the comic’s creators Peter Tomasi and Keith Champagne controlled the rights, allowing them to go to another studio. The Mighty tells the story of a cop who has long worked with Alpha One, the world’s most powerful superhero, until he discovers that this “hero” actually has evil plans, forcing the cop to attempt to stop him.#5 ELMORE LEONARD’S FREAKY DEAKY FINALLY CASTS UPCrime novelist Elmore Leonard’s books have been adapted as several movies, including 3:10 to Yuma (based on a short story), Get Shorty (and its sequel Be Cool), Jackie Brown, and Out of Sight. Leonard’s novel Freaky Deaky has been in various stages of development pretty much since its 1988 publication, including a time when Quentin Tarantino was considering adapting it. This week, the cast of Freaky Deaky expanded considerably as filming is scheduled to start later this month in Michigan. The previously cast William H. Macy will be joined by Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser and Craig Robinson (The Office, Hot Tub Time Machine). Freaky Deaky tells the story of a Detroit cop (Matt Dillon) in the 1970s who is moved from the bomb squad to sex crimes, who then comes across a group of radicals connected to the bombing of a limousine. William H. Macy will play a Hollywood insider, Robinson will play his former Black Panther assistant, and Brendan Fraser will play a former activist who uses his knowledge of bombs for special effects sequences in Hollywood movies. Freaky Deaky was adapted and will be directed by Charles Matthau, who made his directorial debut in 1995 with The Glass Harp, starring his dad Walter Matthau.#6 THIS WEEK IN BRADLEY COOPER NEWSIt is pretty much standard Hollywood playing rules that the week after a big box office opening, a director or actor will make the news a bit. Bradley Cooper (or more accurately, his agents and publicists) sort of overdid it after The Hangover Part II, maybe. Admittedly, two of these projects were already known, but here are Cooper’s three movies that made the news this week, in order of when they will be filming. First up is The Words, a dramatic thriller about a writer (Cooper) who discovers the price for stealing another writer’s work (which doesn’t sound a bit like Secret Window, of course). That movie will have a star-studded cast that will include Ben Barnes (AKA Prince Caspian), John Hannah (The Mummy), Jeremy Irons, Dennis Quaid, Zoe Saldana (Avatar), J.K. Simmons (Spider-Man) and Olivia Wilde (TRON: Legacy). The Words will be the directorial debuts of TRON: Legacy screenwriters Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal, and filming starts this month in Montreal. Next up, filming in July in Schenectady, New York, will be The Place Beyond the Pines. Bradley Cooper will play a cop on the hunt for a motorcycle enthusiast (Ryan Gosling) who starts robbing banks to support his newly born baby. The Place Beyond the Pines reunites Ryan Gosling with director Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine), who also wrote both films. Finally, there was the revelation that Bradley Cooper has aspirations of being a screenwriter in addition to being one of the most sought after actors in Hollywood today. Talking to Charlie Rose, Cooper revealed that he has written an adaptation of the Dan Simmons sci-fi epic novel Hyperion, and hopes to possibly direct the movie as well. Hyperion is set during an intergalactic war in the 28th century, and for more information on that, you can try deciphering the lengthy and technobabble-filled premise here. These combined stories have “Fresh Development” status mostly on the strength of Blue Valentine, and the suggestion via Hyperion that Bradley Cooper is a super king-sized science fiction nerd behind the dimply good looks (in the best possible way, of course).Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 THIS WEEK IN YOUNG ADULT FRANCHISE MOVIESHollywood took the week off, post Memorial Day, from greenlighting movies based on fairy tales and focused instead on one of the community’s other recent obsessions: movies based on Young Adult novel franchises with female protagonists. The 14 year old fanbase isn’t going to make these movies themselves, after all. First off, there is Lionsgate’s adaptation of The Hunger Games, which saw its massive cast get even bigger with the addition of Donald Sutherland as President Snow, “the ruthless autocratic leader of Panem.” Lionsgate also made the news with the revelation that the studio is actually planning on making four movies out of the trilogy that continues with the novels Catching Fire and Mockingjay. How exactly three books will be split up into four movies isn’t yet known, but the popular notion appears to be that Mockingjay would become two movies, in much the same way that the final books in both the Harry Potter and Twilight franchises were done. Ah, but the Young Adult news doesn’t stop there. Universal Pictures has hired director Mary Harron (American Psycho, The Notorious Bettie Page) to take on their adaptation of Wicked Lovely, the first novel in a series of five books by Mellissa Marr. Wicked Lovely revolves around a 17-year-old girl named Aislinn who was born with the ability to see the faeries that are hiding in plain sight in our world, and now finds herself split between “a seductive Faery king” and her mortal boyfriend. Decisions, decisions, decisions! Wicked Lovely was adapted by frequent Tim Burton collaborator and screenwriter Caroline Thompson (Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas). Finally, there is The Mortal Instruments, which is a soon-to-be-produced adaptation of City of Bones, the first novel in the four novel (so far) series by Cassandra Clare. Jaime Campbell Bower, who is best known for playing King Arthur in the Starz series Camelot, has been cast as Jace Wayland opposite Lily Collins, who will play Clary Fray. City of Bones tells the story of Clary Fray, a teenage girl who discovers that she is the descendant of a family of “Shadowhunters,” a secret group of warriors dedicated to driving demons out of the mortal world. The Mortal Instruments will be directed by Scott Stewart (Legion, Priest) from a script by newcomer Jessica Postigo. Surprisingly, there has not yet been any word of Paul Bettany costarring in The Mortal Instruments, which if true, will mark a career first for Scott Stewart. These three movies are collectively in the borderline Rotten Idea category, basically presented to you in order from the Freshest potential to the most Rotten Idea.#2 TARZAN DIRECTOR SAYS IT’S HARD OUT HERE FOR A CHIMPWarner Bros has for a while been trying to get a new live action movie based on Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan books, about an English lord raised in Africa by a family of gorillas. This week, Warner Bros signed a surprising choice to bring Tarzan back to the big screen: director Craig Brewer (Hustle &amp; Flow), whose next movie will be the remake of Footloose (to be released 10/14/11). Craig Brewer reportedly won over Warner Bros with his idea for a story that will stretch out over three movies, forming a new Tarzan trilogy. The news of Brewer’s hiring comes while Warner Bros has also hired screenwriter Adam Cozad (who hasn’t yet had a movie produced, but he has worked on Paramount’s planned Jack Ryan reboot) to also adapt Tarzan into a new live action feature. It’s unknown whether Cozad’s work will be incorporated into Brewer’s trilogy idea, or if a new screenwriter will now be hired. Although Tarzan‘s movie career has slowed down considerably in recent decades (Disney’s animated version being the relatively recent high point), in Hollywood’s golden age, Tarzan was the starring character of dozens of movies. Although the idea of Tarzan getting a 21st century big budget reboot has a lot of promise, this story is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because Craig Brewer seems like such an unlikely and odd choice, associated as he is with mostly musical projects. Does Brewer plan on having Tarzan rap and perform dance routines in the jungle, possibly with a chorus of gorillas, chimps and leopards backing him up? Maybe not, but that this writer even thought of that possibility is why this is a Rotten Idea.#1 HAWKMAN: CARTER HALL AND THE GLIDERS OF THE LOST ARKDC Comics made big news (mostly negative) among fans this week with the revelation that in September, the publisher will be relaunching their entire slate with 52 #1 comics along with major changes and a new online publishing option. These changes include a de-aging of many characters, costume changes like Superman losing his red outside underwear, and matching collars being added to many costumes. One of the characters that is seeing the biggest change is Hawkman, who will star in The Savage Hawkman with a new costume complete with talon-like gloves and porcupine-like wings. Hawkman is one of DC’s oldest superheroes (introduced in 1940), and he has also been the subject of some of the most confusing changes and reboots, to the point that there is not one answer as to who exactly Hawkman even is. Coincidentally, this week, the news also broke about Warner Bros’ plans for a Hawkman movie. The answer can be found in this description sent out to various screenwriting forums, searching for someone to take on the project, “Part INDIANA JONES/DA VINCI CODE, part GHOST tentpole about the fictional superhero that appears in D.C. Comic books. He used archaic weaponry and large, artificial wings attached to a harness made of the Nth metal that allows flight. Most incarnations of Hawkman work closely with a partner/romantic interest named Hawkgirl or Hawkwoman in his fight against supervillains.” That’s right, Warner Bros is comparing Hawkman to Indiana Jones, The Da Vince Code and (of all things), Ghost. The connection here is that the original Hawkman was archaeologist Carter Hall, who discovered in Egyptian ruins a set of wings made of a mysterious “nth metal” that allowed him to fly. Then, in the 1950s, Hawkman was rebooted as a sort of space cop from the planet Thanagar. Hawkman has been a confusing character ever since. This news is the week’s most Rotten Idea because Warner Bros appears to be fitting a fairly simple superhero peg into an Indiana Jones-shaped hole. That is the same problem that DC Comics keeps having too, probably not coincidentally. The difficulty of how to make a Hawkman movie was also sent up quite well in a recent YouTube video sketch (“Hawkward!”).For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"History, Animation, criterion, Larson","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Hangover-Part-III-Already-in-the-Works"},{"id":"47509222149825","title":"Weekly Ketchup: A Live Action Version of Star Blazers?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: A Live Action Version of Star Blazers?Plus, more space opera news, and yet more remakes.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 25, 2011 |  CommentsAlthough this was sort of a slow news week, this week’s Ketchup is chock full of space operas (Star Blazers and Prometheus) and remakes (Les Misérables, Ferdinand the Bull, Soapdish and The Bodyguard).This Week’s Top StoryFROM REMAKES OF TRUE GRIT AND TOP GUN TO… STAR BLAZERS?David Ellison is the name of a young producer whose father is Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and who took a fraction of his wealth and had recent success by partly financing the Coen Brothers remake of True Grit. Other projects that Ellison’s Skydance Productions is currently developing or financing include the Top Gun remake, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol and the reboot of the Jack Ryan franchise. Ellison and Skydance clearly have a penchant for big budget action movies, but they all may pale in comparison to his latest project. David Ellison has started development on a live action, English language adaptation of the 1970s-1980s anime science fiction TV series Star Blazers (the American import of Japan’s Space Battleship Yamato). Star Blazers had an epic storyline which included “alien invasions, the near extinction of the human race, and a last dash journey through space to save the planet.” Ellison has hired screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects; cowriter of Valkyrie) to adapt Star Blazers down to a two hour live action movie. Christopher McQuarrie’s upcoming movies also include Darren Aronofsky’s The Wolverine and cowriting Bryan Singer’s Jack the Giant Killer. This live action movie also follows the 2010 release of the Japanese live action adaptation of Space Battleship Yamato.Fresh Developments This Week#1 MORE SPACE OPERA NEWS: PROMETHEUS CASTING AND OLD MAN’S WARAs if the news of a big budget Star Blazers movie wasn’t enough, that was just one of three news stories this week that one could classify in the “space opera” genre. First up, Ridley Scott’s Prometheus got three new cast members to join Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron. Idris Elba (HBO’s The Wire, Heimdall in Thor), Sean Harris (Red Riding Trilogy) and a relative newcomer, Scottish actress Kate Dickie have all signed on to the 20th Century Fox movie which the producers continue to be quick to note is not a direct prequel to Alien as previously reported. The third evidence that Hollywood has a post-Avatar love affair with big outer space adventures is Paramount’s acquisition of the rights to the John Scalzi novel Old Man’s War. That novel (which has since been followed by three more sequel books) is set in a far future when elderly soldiers trade in their original bodies for genetically enhanced younger clones of themselves so that they can protect human colonies in the far stretches of outer space. Old Man’s War also has a romantic subplot, as the main character eventually meets the younger version of his dead wife, although she doesn’t remember or recognize him. Paramount has attached director Wolfgang Petersen to Old Man’s War, which may be his first movie since 2006’s Poseidon. Before that film, which was considered a box office flop, Wolfgang Petersen directed an impressive string of five hit movies in a row: In the Line of Fire, Outbreak, Air Force One, The Perfect Storm and Troy.#2 FROM THE KING’S SPEECH TO LES MISÉRABLES?First off, it should be noted that this story completely hinges upon the word “may,” but since The Los Angeles Times saw it as fit to print, the Weekly Ketchup will go along as well. This story revolves around director Tom Hooper, who is raking up awards with what was only his second movie, The King’s Speech. Hooper has not yet taken on a new movie since wrapping The King’s Speech last year, and so it’s natural that speculation would be wild about what he might take on next. Which brings us to the “news” that Tom Hooper is “weighing an offer” from Working Title Films to direct a big budget movie adaptation of the extremely successful musical Les Misérables. Based on the 1862 French novel by Victor Hugo, Les Misérables tells the story of a former prison inmate Jean Valjean who tries to reinvent his life as a good man, but is plagued by a relentless officer of the law Javert (well, he’s slightly less relentless in the musical), with the French Revolution also happening all around them. Les Misérables has previously been adapted to film and television many times, with one of the most recent examples being the 1998 movie that featured Geoffrey Rush (as Javert), who also costarred in The King’s Speech.#3 FOX ANIMATION REMAKING A DISNEY CLASSIC: FERDINAND THE BULLFox Animation Studios has acquired the feature film rights to the 1936 children’s book The Story of Ferdinand by author Munro Leaf and illustrator Robert Lawson. Also known as Ferdinand the Bull, the short story tells of a pacifist bull who would rather enjoy the pasture than go fight the matadors. The story of Ferdinand the Bull is probably best known because of the 1938 animated short film that won Walt Disney his eighth Academy Award (which you can watch here). Fox and Blue Sky Studios intend to adapt The Story of Ferdinand as a full length CGI animated feature. The movie will be directed by Carlos Saldanha, who directed Ice Age: The Meltdown and the upcoming Rio, and who codirected most of Blue Sky’s other animated movies. An attorney for the estate of Robert Lawson noted that unlike many classic Disney projects (not counting works in the public domain like Snow White), the studio never acquired the rights to The Story of Ferdinand other than that one short film. That mistake back in the 1930s is what has now enabled Fox to make a movie that might have otherwise been Disney’s exclusive property.#4 STEVE CARELL TO GET SERIOUS WITH THE DOGS OF BABELIt’s an inevitable rite of passage for many comedic actors: eventually, they want to go dramatic (and maybe get some Oscar gold). Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, Bill Murray, Jim Carrey, even Adam Sandler… they all did it. Although the dramedy of Dan in Real Life and Little Miss Sunshine were half-steps in that direction, Steve Carell has not yet had a heavy dramatic film, absent any comic undertones. That apparently changed this week with the news that Carell has signed to star in Dogs of Babel, based upon the best-selling novel by Carolyn Parkhurst. Described as a “tragic yet beautiful story of love and loss,” Dogs of Babel tells the story of a linguistics professor who attempts to his teach his dog to talk in the hopes that the pet can answer the mysteries surrounding his wife’s death in their backyard. This writer almost teared up halfway through typing that sentence. Dogs of Babel was adapted by screenwriter Jamie Linden, who also adapted We Are Marshall and Dear John, and will be making his directorial debut with the upcoming Ten Year, also starring Dear John lead Channing Tatum. Dogs of Babel does not yet have a director, and with Steve Carell already attached to several comedy projects, there’s no telling when Dogs of Babel might actually get made. However, the producers say they are looking for a director “right away” (possibly Jamie Linden himself?), so Dogs of Babel may happen sooner rather than later.#5 LOUIS LETERRIER SAYS NOW YOU SEE ME, THEN U’S GIn the last year, online opinions about French action director Louis Leterrier seemed to have dipped, following Clash of the Titans. Before that remake, however, Leterrier’s track record was solidly in the middle critically (the first two Transporter movies, Unleashed and The Incredible Hulk), which is pretty good for an action director. So, this column is putting news of his next two movies in the “Fresh Developments” category, by a hair. First, there will be the heist movie Now You See Me for Summit Entertainment. The story “pits a crack FBI squad in a game of cat and mouse against a super-team of the world’s greatest illusionists, who pull off a series of bank heists during their performances, showering their profits on their audiences while staying one step ahead of the law.” Now You See Me was written by Boaz Yakin (cowriter of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights) and Edward Ricourt (who doesn’t have any produced credits yet). The news of that project was followed a few days later by the announcement that Leterrier has also signed with Universal Pictures to direct G, a disaster movie formerly known as Gravity. Compared to The Day After Tomorrow and Taken, G is about “a father who has to search for his lost child as the world stops spinning and Earth begins to lose its gravity.” At this point, G is just a concept, and Universal is currently looking for screenwriters to actually turn the idea into 100 pages or so of actual dialogue and action scenes.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 MICHAEL BAY VS. ZOMBIES VS. ROBOTSMichael Bay’s Platinum Dunes production company (best known for their recent horror remakes) has acquired the rights to the IDW comic book series Zombies Vs. Robots. The deal includes a script based on the comic called Inherit the Earth (possibly a working or subtitle) by J.T. Petty, whose previous work is mostly on video games and the 2008 direct-to-video title The Burrowers. The comic book is about a young girl who is the last survivor of a zombie apocalypse, with a group of robots protecting her from a new pack of zombies that have evolved and are now intelligent. The premise of pitting robots against zombies is somewhat promising in a cheeky B-movie way, but this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, mostly because the words “Michael” and “Bay” appear in the story.#3 I AM PREACHER FOURGarth Ennis’ blasphemous Vertigo Comics comic book series Preacher has had a long, decade-long road to getting adapted in some form. In addition to being in development as a movie, HBO was at one point considering a television series which would adapt each issue as an hour-long episode (which was a pretty clever idea). Preacher is the story of a minister who receives a powerful supernatural ability who, along with a motley group of friends (including a vampire), sets off across America in search of God, who he is quite upset with (to put it mildly). HBO eventually scrapped the Preacher series in 2008, and now the movie has a new director attached. DJ Caruso has directed such movies as Disturbia, Eagle Eye, Two for the Money, Taking Lives and this week’s release I Am Number Four. This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because D.J. Caruso seems like a rather “middle of the road” choice for an adaptation that is so edgy and inherently violent and vulgar. There’s also the issue of D.J. Caruso’s movies mostly getting Tomatometer scores in the 20-30% range, except for Disturbia and The Salton Sea.#2 BIZARRE REMAKE OF THE WEEK: SOAPDISHIn the 1980s and early 1990s, the daytime soap opera was in what we can now see as sort of its golden age. Several soaps had characters and plots identifiable by the public at large, and some of the actors from that time went on to become bigger stars (Alec Baldwin, Meg Ryan, Courteney Cox, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Demi Moore, etc.). In 1991, Paramount released the comedy Soapdish, which was a star-studded (Whoopi Goldberg, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr, etc) comedy set behind the scenes of a fictional soap opera. Today, the daytime soap opera appears to be in a state of fast decline, with a few long-running series ending recently (Guiding Light, As the World Turns), so that now there are only six shows left. Considering that, it is extremely odd news that Paramount is developing a remake of Soapdish. The Soapdish remake will be written by actor-turned-writer Ben Schwartz, who has written several episodes of Robot Chicken and also won an Emmy in 2009 for writing Hugh Jackman’s Academy Awards monologue. It’s possible (actually, quite likely) that the dwindling popularity of daytime soap operas will be an element in the remake’s script, but that doesn’t totally forgive that someone at Paramount thought a remake of Soapdish was a good idea.#1 WARNER BROS SAYS IIIIIIIIIII WILL ALWAYS LOVE THE BODYGUARDThe old thought about remakes is that it is better to remake a movie that was flawed the first time than to remake one that worked (which is actually an argument for the Soapdish remake, admittedly). One movie that definitely worked was the 1992 romance The Bodyguard, starring Whitney Houston as a pop singer and Kevin Costner as the title character, which did much, much better than anyone probably could have predicted (it was the #2 movie of the year, behind only Disney’s Aladdin). What one person sees however, as a reason not to remake The Bodyguard is probably Warner Bros’ reason for doing exactly that. The studio has hired screenwriters Jeremiah Friedman and Nick Palmer (neither of whom yet have a produced movie to their credit) to adapt the original script by Lawrence Kasdan. Friedman and Palmer did write the action comedy Family Getaway for Warner Bros, and which made the 2010 Black List of top rated unproduced scripts. The premise of the remake will reportedly follow a former Iraq veteran who has to protect his client from the scary Internet and “stalkers who can track stars on Twitter, Gawker Stalker, Google Maps and countless other sites.” Warner Bros’ plans for a remake of The Bodyguard follow the recent news that Clint Eastwood will be directing Beyonce in the latest version of A Star is Born. The reason this remake is this week’s Most Rotten Idea is that the bar is set impossibly high. In order not to fail in comparison, this remake will have to do what, be the #1 movie of the year in which it’s released? The original’s success was helped in great part by Whitney Houston’s cover of Dolly Parton’s “I Will Always Love You.” Can a single song achieve the same level of success for a movie today? This story is not, however, the end of Kevin Costner news this week. There is also “buzz” that Costner is a top choice of director Zack Snyder to costar in his reboot of Superman. There’s no word yet as to whom Kevin Costner would play, but the most logical guess has to be Jonathan “Pa” Kent. Costner has the requisite rugged Midwestern charm (even though he’s from California), Field of Dreams could have been set in Smallville, and Costner even looks a bit like John Schneider these days.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Universe, Marathons, heist, VH1, Network, books","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-A-Live-Action-Version-of-Star-Blazers"},{"id":"47509222167242","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Fresh Developments from 2010","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Fresh Developments from 201012 of the top stories of the year, one from each month.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 27, 2010 |  CommentsThe year that was 2010 is coming to an end, and so it’s time to look back at the biggest news items of the year (in lieu of actual weekly movie news, which there isn’t much of around Christmas). This is also a chance to look forward, as most of the movies that were announced in 2010 are still in our collective futures. And so, here are twelve “Fresh Development” movie news items from the past year, one for each month, that also represent some of the biggest upcoming movies of the next few years.JANUARY: HUGO CABRET: FROM THE DIRECTOR OF TAXI DRIVER AND GOODFELLAS COMES… A KIDS MOVIE?In degrees of news stories, an element that makes for some of the biggest items is the unexpected. Christopher Nolan’s directing another Batman movie? Yeah, we sort of expected that. Martin Scorsese is directing an adaptation of a kids book called The Invention of Hugo Cabret? That, not so much. The movie’s title has since been shortened to just Hugo Cabret, and as reported here in January, filming has since wrapped on the European production about a boy who secretly lives within the walls of a busy 19th century Paris train station. Scorsese attracted an all-star cast to his first venture into the “family adventure” genre which includes Sacha Baron Cohen, Ben Kingsley, Jude Law, Christopher Lee, Chloe Moretz, Emily Mortimer and Ray Winstone. 13-year-old English actor Asa Butterfield, who is currently best known for starring in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (not as the titular boy, but as the boy’s German friend) may be in line to become one of the breakout stars of 2011 if Hugo Cabret is the critical and box office hit that it could be. Hugo Cabret will be co-distributed by Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros, and is scheduled for release in the USA on December 11, 2011. Martin Scorsese also made news this year with the casting of his upcoming mob movie The Irishman, which will include Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino, all appearing in the same movie together for the first time.FEBRUARY: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN IS THE “GODFATHER” OF THE NEXT SUPERMAN REBOOTAdmittedly, the really big news item for Warner Bros’ planned reboot of the Superman franchise was the October hiring of director Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen, the upcoming Sucker Punch). However, October was a month full of big “Fresh” movie news, and February, well, wasn’t. But, really, the road to Snyder coming aboard the next Superman movie started with the news in February that Christopher Nolan had agreed to work with Warner Bros as a sort of artistic “godfather” to help the movie get going in a fashion appropriate to its potential. It was through Nolan that Warner Bros picked up a Superman story idea from screenwriter David S. Goyer (who received “story” credit for Nolan’s first two Batman movies, as well as the upcoming third film), who is also now cowriting the reboot with Nolan’s brother Jonathan Nolan. It’s also worth noting that one of the reasons Warner Bros hired the Nolans, Goyer and Snyder in a relatively quick manner this year is that the studio needs to start filming the Superman reboot by 2011. Otherwise, the studio risks losing the rights to the estates of Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The Superman reboot is currently scheduled by Warner Bros for a release in December, 2012. Christopher Nolan’s third and final Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises (scheduled for July 20, 2012), also made the news this year a few times. The most notable story was the casting of Inception costar Tom Hardy in an unknown role, possibly as one of the film’s villains.MARCH: THE J. EDGAR HOOVER BIOPIC IS FIRST ANNOUNCEDA high profile biopic that has a lot of movie fans cautiously optimistic was first announced in March of this year. At the time, the first details that were revealed about the movie now known as J. Edgar (formerly Hoover) was that the story of the life of FBI founder and original director J. Edgar Hoover were just the producers and the screenwriter. Dustin Lance Black, the Oscar winning screenwriter of the biopics Milk and Pedro, was announced as working with Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment. A month later, we learned that the star to play J. Edgar Hoover would be Leonardo DiCaprio, and that the movie would be Clint Eastwood’s next as director after this year’s Hereafter. The latest news for J. Edgar came just a few weeks ago, as Armie Hammer (The Social Network) and Charlize Theron are reportedly in talks to costar, respectively, as Hoover’s longtime companion Clyde Tolson and Hoover’s personal secretary Helen Gandy. Filming of J. Edgar begins in early 2011, and it may be released by Warner Bros in late 2011 as part of next year’s Oscar season.APRIL: RON HOWARD’S EPIC MOVIE AND TELEVISION PLANS FOR STEPHEN KING’S THE DARK TOWERThis story has the distinction of actually appearing in the Weekly Ketchup twice this year (with a few more details the second time), and both times, it was the Top Story. In April, it was revealed that Ron Howard and Brian Grazer of Imagine Entertainment had entered into negotations with Universal Pictures and Weed Road (Jonah Hex, The Losers) to adapt Stephen King’s magnum opus, the series of novels known collectively as The Dark Tower. That deal was then confirmed during the slow post-Labor Day week in early September. The Dark Tower is a fantasy epic that combines elements of classic Old West cowboy themes with supernatural and fantasy elements, telling the story of the last member of an order of “gunslingers” descended from King Arthur’s Knights of the Round Table. Ron Howard will personally direct at least the first of three movies based upon books in the series, and also direct the first season of an NBC television series that will fill in the gaps in between each of the three movies. Coproducer Akiva Goldsman (Batman &amp; Robin; cowriter of I, Robot, I Am Legend) will also write the first movie and the first season of the TV series. Given the massive scope of this project, it is probably a few years from actually getting started, but if all goes well, it’s possible we could see the first movie by sometime in 2013.MAY: DAVID FINCHER HEADING 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAAs I went back through the year looking for the freshest ideas each month, I was surprised to find a pretty significant initial announcement here in May that I myself as a movie fan had sort of forgot about. In all the press about The Social Network, the emphasis has been on director David Fincher’s next project being the English language adaptation of the late Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (which he is currently filming). However, in May, David Fincher was also first mentioned as being hired by Walt Disney Pictures for a very different movie which has the potential of being the biggest production the already ambitious director has ever tackled. That project is Disney’s long-in-development plan to remake their 1954 hit movie based upon Jules Verne’s 19th century science fiction adventure novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The movie is admittedly at least a year away from filming, but the promise of Fincher working on a movie with the sort of epic scale that 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea potentially could have is definitely something that we movie fans should not overlook.JUNE: AFTER THREE SPIDER-MAN MOVIES, DIRECTOR SAM RAIMI TAKES ON THE ORIGINAL WINGLESS WIZARDThe January news of Sam Raimi’s departure from the Spider-Man film franchise (and Sony’s subsequent decision to do a reboot) obviously left a big gaping hole in the director’s schedule. Raimi has long been attached to direct for Warner Bros an adaptation of the Warcraft video game franchise, but 2010 came and went without an official announcement of that movie project being greenlit. In June, the movie that emerged as Sam Raimi’s next was Walt Disney Pictures’ Oz: The Great and Powerful, a new spin on the classic L. Frank Baum character, to be played by Robert Downey Jr. Oz: The Great and Powerful is just one of many movies in active development that are somehow related to L. Frank Baum’s Oz books. Universal’s planned adaptation of the stage musical Wicked is probably the closest thematic relative (as both focus on a supporting character who isn’t Dororthy Gale). Oz: The Great and Powerful wasn’t however, the only project that Raimi’s name was associated with this year. There was also a rumor about a possible reboot of The Shadow, an adaptation of the futuristic cowboy comic book series Earp: Saints for Sinners, and the alien invasion movie EDF (Earth Defense Force) (which Raimi is producing but not directing).JULY: THE SOCIAL NETWORK STAR ANDREW GARFIELD IS THE NEW SPIDER-MANThis right here is probably the story that might be the most disputed by movie fans in the comments below. When Sony Pictures announced in January that they were scrapping plans for a fourth Spider-Man movie featuring Tobey Maguire, and going with a reboot of the franchise instead, I myself wrote up the story as the week’s Most Rotten Idea. That story included the news that the new director would be Marc Webb, whose (500) Days of Summer was one of the best movies (in my opinion) of 2009. However, it was difficult at the time to not be distracted by the concept of a successful franchise being “rebooted” less than eight years after it began. It is arguable that with the July announcement that American-British actor Andrew Garfield would be the new Peter Parker will ultimately be seen as the turning point for how the public perceives this reboot. Or perhaps, it would be more accurate to say that the October 1, 2010 release of The Social Network was that turning point. Looking back now, we can speculate that because the executives and producers at Sony/Columbia had seen The Social Network in July (but we had not), they knew exactly what they had in that movie’s memorable costar, Andrew Garfield (who played Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin). Of course, those were just two of the Spider-Man stories this year, which were followed by the casting of Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, the casting of Rhys Ifans as The Lizard, the casting of Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, the casting of Denis Leary as Captain Stacy, and well, a whole bunch more people too. The as-yet-untitled Spider-Man reboot is scheduled for release by Columbia Pictures on July 3, 2012.AUGUST: TOM HANKS AND SANDRA BULLOCK COSTARRING TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIMEAugust was admittedly a very quiet month in movie news, particularly when one limits the field to movie stories that one would consider “fresh developments.” Perhaps that’s a reflection of how August is itself perceived by Hollywood in terms of what movies are released in that month, as especially the later Fridays are often a “dumping ground” for movies that end up being “rotten.” One film that stood out in August was the announcement of Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close, which appears to be as close to a complete “Oscar bait” movie as one could imagine getting made. The film will mark the first time that “America’s Sweethearts” Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock have ever costarred together, playing the parents of a 9-year-old child prodigy who goes on a personal journey through the five boroughs of New York City in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. Director Stephen Daldry has only directed three movies (Billy Elliot, The Hours, The Reader) and all three earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Director. The script was adapted from a novel by Safran Foer (Everything is Illuminated) by screenwriter Eric Roth, who won an Oscar for Forrest Gump, and was also nominated for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and for cowriting Munich and The Insider. Filming is scheduled to start in New York City in early January, and codistributors Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros are likely to try to get the movie in theaters in late 2011 in time for awards consideration.SEPTEMBER: MARTIN FREEMAN EMERGES AS THE TOP CHOICE TO PLAY BILBO BAGGINS IN THE HOBBITAdmittedly, the process of squeezing in twelve of the top “fresh” movie stories of the year to match all twelve months means that sometimes the date actually matches something more like the second biggest news item for a given movie. The question of who would star in Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit as Bilbo Baggins was officially confirmed in October ( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hobbit-2010/news/1921059/weekly_ketchup_martin_freeman_cast_as_the_hobbit/ ). However, it was actually in September that we first heard ( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stephen_king_dvd_collector_set/news/1920697/weekly_ketchup_ron_howard_takes_on_the_dark_tower/ ) about Martin Freeman. Martin Freeman is not a household name in the U.S., but he might be recognizable as Arthur Dent in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and supporting roles in Hot Fuzz and Love, Actually, and for the U.K. version of The Office. When Freeman was confirmed in October, his story also came along with the names of several of the actors who will be playing the members of Thorin’s Company of Dwarves. The large ensemble cast is still in the process of being fully cast, with the latest batch being announced two weeks ago ( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hobbit/news/1921465/weekly_ketchup_blanchett_to_appear_in_the_hobbit/ ). That latest list of names included Cate Blanchett, who will have a significant returning role as the elf Galadriel, despite the character not actually appearing in the original novel at all. Filming of the two parts of The Hobbit is scheduled to start in New Zealand in February, 2011, in preparation for the release of the two movies in December of 2012 and 2013, respectively.OCTOBER: DARREN ARONOFSKY FINALLY GETS HIS SUPERHERO MOVIE: THE WOLVERINEThis story actually got its story in September. At that time, Darren Aronofsky was first mentioned as being one of the directors talking to 20th Century Fox about the sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, along with David Slade (The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, 30 Days of Night). As fantastic as the idea of Darren Aronofsky finally getting to make a big budget superhero movie seemed, however, many fans (and rightly so) most likely took the story with a grain of salt so big Logan would have a hard time cutting it down to size. That’s why the official announcement in October is where the newly-titled The Wolverine actually falls on this countdown. Written by Chris McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects; cowriter of Valkyrie), The Wolverine is described as being a movie that returns the most popular X-Men member to his roots as a dark, somber, intense and obviously violent character. The Wolverine is also the movie that will depict Logan’s time in Japan, following the events of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It’s one thing to say that, but in hiring Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream), 20th Century Fox accomplished the goal of sending that message to the fans. Martin Scorsese might be making kids movies now (well, one at least), but it’s unlikely Darren Aronofsky will be doing that anytime soon.NOVEMBER: DANIEL DAY LEWIS HELPS STEVEN SPIELBERG REVIVE HIS DREAM OF A LINCOLN MOVIEWhen Liam Neeson dropped out of Steven Spielberg’s long-planned Lincoln biopic this past July, it appeared at the time as if that might be the end of what has long been the director’s most cherished pet project. In November, however, another Irish actor joined the project, and it was an actor who’s appeared in less movies in the last 10 years than Liam Neeson has done in the last 10 months: Daniel Day-Lewis. Although Liam Neeson is also a talented actor, Daniel Day-Lewis is arguably in a completely different league (although being so picky about his roles undoubtedly helps Day-Lewis refine his reputation). Lincoln was adapted by playwright Tony Kushner (Angels in America) from the book Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin. Goodwin’s book is about “the political collision of Lincoln and the powerful men of his cabinet on the road to abolition and the end of the Civil War.” Steven Spielberg also announced this year and then filmed the World War I movie War Horse. That movie will be released by Touchstone Pictures on December 28, 2011, just five days after the December 23, 2011 release by Paramount Pictures of The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn. Steven Spielberg is expected to start filming Lincoln in late 2011 in time for a late 2012 release date through Disney’s Touchstone Pictures.DECEMBER: JAMES BOND 23 STILL HAPPENINGConsidering the post Thanksgiving lull and the fact that almost nothing happens for the last two weeks, December is for obvious reasons a month in which a lot less news emerges. The movie that lands in this spot actually had arguably “fresh” news in January and November as well, but well, December is the place where it fits best. The movie in question is the 23rd entry in the James Bond franchise. The December news is actually very similar to the news that first appeared in January, but the difference is everything that happened in between. In January, EON Productions announced that they had hired British filmmaker Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) as a “consultant,” possibly due to MGM’s financial straits at the time, and the question of whether they could officially announce him as the next director in the franchise. As positive as that news seemed, a week after Sam Mendes was confirmed by Barbara Broccoli as signing on to direct three months later, James Bond fans were struck a blow. EON announced in April that plans for the 23rd James Bond movie had been “indefinitely postponed.” Following that news, Daniel Craig signed on to star in director David Fincher’s English language remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. However, as MGM continues to emerge from its financial crisis in its new form, good news has returned to the Bond franchise. In November, a financial report listed the 23rd James Bond movie as being scheduled for a November, 2012 release date. This all leads to the recent December news that Kate Winslet has revealed that she plans to move back to England temporarily so that Mendes (from whom she is currently separated) can spend time with their children.So there you have them, twelve of the freshest developments of 2010.

Hollywood’s ongoing obsession with remakes is particularly evident, as remakes of Fantastic Voyage, Highlander, Jack the Giant Killer, Logan’s Run and Red Sonja are all covered this week. Finally, I should mention that this week marked my third anniversary at Rotten Tomatoes as the writer of the Weekly Ketchup. My very first column was published on February 8, 2008, which made Rotten Tomatoes my new online home after ten years as the creator and writer of Upcomingmovies.com.This Week’s Top StoryRYAN GOSLING GOES FOR A JOG IN LOGAN’S RUNOrdinarily, this column is a bit of a Negative Nancy when it comes to remakes. However, that’s usually because the original was a good movie to begin with. Such was not necessarily the case with the 1976 science fiction film Logan’s Run (regardless of its 70% Tomatometer, which seems to be viewed through rose-colored glasses). Logan’s Run was based upon a 1967 novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson about a future society where utopia was maintained by killing everyone when they reached a certain age (21 in the book, 30 in the movie). A look back at the original Logan’s Run trailer makes Star Wars, which came out just a year later, look even more amazing. Warner Bros has been trying to remake Logan’s Run for nearly a decade, including a time in which Bryan Singer was attached to direct, before eventually moving on to Jack the Giant Slayer (see below). Now, the Logan’s Run remake finally has not only a director, but a star (who is in talks). Director Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Valhalla Rising) will reunite with Ryan Gosling, the star of his next film (Drive, due out September 16, 2011). Gosling will play the title role originated by Michael York. This is a career change for Ryan Gosling, who has mostly focused recently on non-studio projects, although he has appeared in a few like The Notebook, Remember the Titans and Murder by Numbers.Fresh Developments This Week#1 E (EINSTEIN) = M (MOVIE) TIMES C (COOLNESS) SQUAREDThe production company of producer Paul Schiff (Rushmore, Young Guns) has announced that filming is expected to start soon on Einstein, a biopic about famed German physicist Albert Einstein. Einstein will be directed by Wayne Wang (Smoke, Blue in the Face, Maid in Manhattan) from a screenplay by Academy Award winner Ronald Bass (Dangerous Minds; cowriter of Rain Man, Amelia). Here’s what one of the producers had to say about the movie’s scope: “People don’t know about his struggles with poverty, his dyslexia, his love for music, his relationships with the women in his life, his persecution by the Nazis and his battle to deal with living in the public eye and being under constant scrutiny. Ron’s screenplay peels back the layers and allows us to see past Einstein the scientist and Einstein the celebrity, showing us Einstein the man.” The casting search for the actor to play Albert Einstein will now start in the next few weeks. Einstein is expected to be filmed mostly in Germany and at other locations throughout Europe.#2 THE STAR OF ABOUT A BOY IS ALL GROWN UP AND READY TO DO SOME GIANT KILLINGThe star of one of my favorite movies of the last 10 years was in Clash of the Titans last year, and has been cast in X-Men: First Class as the Beast, and I didn’t even realize it until today. Nicholas Hoult, who starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant at age 12, is now 21 years old and barely recognizable (unless you’re looking for it, I would argue). Hoult has also now landed his first major starring role since About a Boy, and there’s a good chance it will be a high profile star-making movie. Nicholas Hoult will star as the title character in Jack the Giant Killer, the big budget Warner Bros adaptation of the Jack and the Beanstalk fairy tale that director Bryan Singer (X-Men, Superman Returns) has been trying to get made for a few years now. Stanley Tucci has also signed on to costar, playing an advisor to the (human) king of Jack’s kingdom, and the film’s main villain. Bill Nighy (Love, Actually) will play Fallon, the leader of the giants, who is also two-headed, with the other head being played by John Kassir (the voice of the Cryptkeeper from Tales from the Crypt). The IMDb lists six other previous movies called Jack the Giant Killer, with the most high profile adaptation being the 1962 film starring Kerwin Matthews, which featured stop motion animation that was not done by Ray Harryhausen, and is generally considered to be sort of awful. Mickey Mouse also starred in the short film Mickey and the Beanstalk, which was part of the Fun and Fancy Free anthology in 1947. Filming of Jack the Giant Killer starts in March, 2011.#3 DAKOTA FANNING JOINING THE ROYAL FAMILY IN GIRLS’ NIGHT OUTIn the same week that saw the release of the first image of Meryl Streep as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, another famous British Margaret has been cast. American actress Dakota Fanning (who will soon turn 17) will star in the British production Girls’ Night Out. The movie will be set during the original V.E. Day (Victory in Europe Day) in 1945, when teenage Princesses Margaret (Fanning) and Elizabeth were allowed out of Buckingham Palace for one night to join in the public celebrations. The role of Princess Elizabeth (AKA the current Queen) has yet to be cast. On May 8, 1945, Princess Margaret was 14, and Princess Elizabeth was 19, and she was 27 when she was coronated eight years later in 1953. Princess Margaret went on to suffer many years of illness, including having her left lung removed in 1985, suffering several strokes and eventually dying in 2002. Queen Elizabeth, on the other hand, has been reigning now for 59 years, and at age 84 appears to still be in remarkable health. Girls’ Night Out will be directed by British director Michael Hoffman (The Last Station, One Fine Day). Hoffman is currently working on the remake of the 1966 caper Gambit, working from a script adapted by the Coen Brothers, which will star Colin Firth and Cameron Diaz.#4 HARRY HOUDINI AND ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE TO HEAR VOICES FROM THE DEADThis writer discovered while working on this piece that two historical figures that he associated more with the 19th century actually lived well into the 1920s. Escape artist Harry Houdini died in 1926 and Sherlock Holmes author Arthur Conan Doyle died in 1930. Not only that, but the two were good friends (something else I didn’t know). That friendship is the basis for an original screenplay picked up by DreamWorks this week from screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski (Changeling; cowriter of Ninja Assassin), who also was the creator of the Babylon 5 television series. Voices from the Dead tells the (fictional) story of Houdini and Doyle teaming up with a psychic to solve a series of murders in 1920s New York City. One thing that is particularly interesting about this concept is that neither man was particularly young in 1920: Houdini was 46, and Doyle was 61. So, that gives an idea of who might be cast in Voices from the Dead (particularly Doyle), if DreamWorks is planning on being faithful to their ages. Two days after this story broke, it was revealed that the SyFy channel is also developing a series about Houdini and Doyle solving mysteries in 1920s New York City. Called Among the Spirits, the series will team the duo up with a female police officer and will feature them investigating mysteries that appear to be supernatural, but aren’t necessarily (tying in with Houdini’s second career as a debunker).#5 ZOMBIES ATE MY NEIGHBORS EYES MOVIE THEATERS FOR DESSERTIn recent months, several video game adaptations have made the Rotten Ideas list mostly because the original games had very little narrative to base a movie upon (i.e. Missile Command). By the 1990s, however, video games did indeed start to have well-defined stories. One such game was the 1993 Super Nintendo/Sega Genesis title Zombies Ate My Neighbors, which was a comedic homage to classic horror movies and the zombie genre in particular. Zombies Ate My Neighbors was not a commercial success, but the LucasArts/Konami collaboration was well reviewed, and with time (and nostalgia) has become a minor cult classic. The game followed two teenagers as they advanced through 50 levels of neighborhood terrain, fighting an assortment of movie-style monsters that included vampires and werewolves in addition to zombies. Now, screenwriter John Darko (who doesn’t yet have any produced theatrical releases to his credit) is working on finding financing for an independent adaptation of Zombies Ate My Neighbors as a comedic horror movie in the style of Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead. This story was ignored by most sites this week, possibly because of its current independent status, but it’s being included here because this seems like the sort of potentially clever and cool videogame adaptation that should be encouraged.#6 STEPHENIE MEYER’S THE HOST BEING ADAPTED BY A TEAM TOO TALENTED TO BE LABELED ROTTENWith the last two parts of the Twilight Saga adaptations now being filmed, Hollywood is getting ready to move on to Stephenie Meyer’s other books, starting with the 2008 science fiction novel The Host. The book is set on a version of Earth where most people have been taken over by “altruistic parasites” (which seems like an oxymoron). There are a few “resistors,” including a young lady named Melanie Stryder who becomes involved in a love triangle that involves two people and an alien parasite. The premise of The Host arguably has some similarities to that of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, in which a werewolf falls in love with a telepathic baby. The Host will be directed by British director Susanna White, whose previous work includes Nanny McPhee Returns, the BBC mini-series Jane Eyre and the HBO mini-series Generation Kill. The Host was adapted by screenwriter and Academy Award nominee Andrew Niccol (The Truman Show, Gattaca), who is currently the science thriller Now (which has a similar premise to Logan’s Run, see above). Unlike most stories about The Twilight Saga, The Host lands in the Fresh Development category because the novel actually did receive a lot of positive reviews, and both Susanna White and Andrew Niccol have promising resumes.Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 COMEDY DIRECTOR SETS OFF ON A FANTASTIC VOYAGEFantastic Voyage, released in 1966, was a science fiction thriller about a submarine containing team of scientists that is shrunk to microscopic size so that it can fix a deadly clot in a scientist’s brain. James Cameron has been trying to get a 3D remake of Fantastic Voyage produced for quite a while now, but the problem of finding a director has kept it stalled until now. 20th Century Fox has hired comedy director Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum, Date Night, The Pink Panther) to work on the Fantastic Voyage remake. This new Fantastic Voyage has been referred to as more of a “re-imagining” than a remake (although one could argue that the two mean the same thing these days), and now with the hiring of Levy, we get an idea of what sort of re-imagining is likely being done. The script was adapted by Shane Salerno (Armageddon, Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem) and was rewritten by Laeta Kalogridis (Pathfinder, Shutter Island). The screenwriters don’t seem to suggest a comedic approach, but it’s possible that Levy is being brought in to give the movie a comic touch that is more visual and transcends what is on the written page. The other possibility is that Shawn Levy is trying to move into non-comedic material, which his upcoming “boxing robot” movie Real Steel also appears to be doing. However, since we only know Levy’s comedic work, it’s difficult to discern how effective Fantastic Voyage will be, whatever he does with the premise. And it’s the premise that truly lands Fantastic Voyage in the Rotten Idea category. With nanotechnology getting more and more advanced, it would no longer really be necessary for actual scientists to be shrunk down, when there are already tiny robots that could be used to perform this operation. And if nanotech can’t do this specific operation now, they will probably be able to in a few years, certainly before anyone perfects a “shrinking ray.” That, however, wasn’t the only news that Shawn Levy and 20th Century Fox made this week. Levy will produce with Fox Animation an adaptation of the popular Mr. Men illustrated children’s books by British author Roger Hargreaves. Hargreaves wrote 48 Mr. Men books, and the colorful “smiley face” characters have been adapted into four different animated television series.#2 AMBER HEARD WANTED TO DON THE CHAIN MAIL BIKINI OF RED SONJARed Sonja is a chain mail bikini-clad warrior amazon who has her adventures in the same Hyborian Age as Robert E. Howard’s Conan, and she first appeared in the 1970s Marvel Comics adaptations of that character. Red Sonja was eventually adapted as a 1985 movie starring Brigitte Nielsen and Arnold Schwarzenegger (though not as Conan). In recent years, director Robert Rodriguez had been working on a new Red Sonja movie which would have starred his then-girlfriend Rose McGowan, but in 2010, Rodriguez’s project was put on hold. Now, producer Avi Lerner, who produced the upcoming Conan the Barbarian reboot, has announced that Red Sonja is still moving forward, and is expected to be produced in between Conan the Barbarian and its expected sequel. Lerner’s comments bring us two bits of news, the first of which is that Simon West (Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Con Air) has been chosen to direct. The latest news about Simon West was that he was planning on reuniting with Nicolas Cage on an action movie called Medallion. As for who Lerner wants to cast as Red Sonja herself, the producer said, “we just finished a movie called Drive Angry with Amber Heard, and I want to see her. She’s my favorite for the role.” Amber Heard is possibly best known for starring in All the Boys Love Mandy Lane, and she also had a small role in Zombieland. It’s also curious that she was in Drive Angry, which also stars Nicolas Cage, which ties this movie back to director Simon West again (which suggests, perhaps, that Cage could be recruited to star in Red Sonja as well… but that’s just speculation). Red Sonja is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas, however, mostly because Red Sonja seems like a low-grade sword and sorcery concept that would mostly be made for its T&amp;A appeal. Yes, chain mail bikinis are sexy, but can you imagine how uncomfortable that outfit is?#1 HIGHLANDER REMAKE PROVES THAT THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONEBack in 2008, Summit Entertainment announced plans to remake the classic 1986 fantasy film Highlander. Highlander starred Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery and introduced the world to a supernatural struggle (set in the “real world”) between immortal warriors that is epitomized by the often-referenced tagline, “there can be only one.” Highlander went on to become a very prolific franchise, including six movies (one of them animated), three television series (one of them animated), a comic book and ten novels. There hasn’t been much to talk about the Highlander reboot in the last three years, but this week, the project came back out of obscurity with quite a bit of news to make up for lost time. Neal Moritz, the producer of such big action movies as I Am Legend and the xXx and Fast and the Furious franchises, is now producing the Highlander reboot for Summit Entertainment. Along with him, Moritz has hired director Justin Lin, who directed three of the five movies in that latter franchise: The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, 2009’s Fast &amp; Furious and the upcoming Fast Five. One has to wonder if that means that Connor MacLeod will be spending a lot of time in souped-up race cars as well as wielding his head-chopping sword. However, it’s the screenwriter that really gives us an idea of what sort of Highlander reboot this might be. In addition to producing many episodes of The O.C., Dexter and Birds of Prey, Melissa Rosenberg is best known as the sole screenwriter of all five adaptations of Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight Saga (she also cowrote Step Up). Back when the Highlander reboot was first announced in 2008, it was described as having more of a romantic element than the original. The choice of Melissa Rosenberg as the screenwriter seems to back that up, and that’s why this is the week’s Most Rotten Idea. Does anyone really want to see Highlander rebooted and reshaped to appeal to Twilight fans, probably with scenes of Connor and Juan (Sean Connery in the original) moping about the stresses and romantic complications of immortality?For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Academy, The, FXX, Box, foreign, hist, Annual, Lucasfilm, TV, Golden","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Ryan-Gosling-to-Tackle-Logans-Run"},{"id":"47509220721340","title":"Weekly Ketchup: A Live Action Justice League Movie in 2013?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: A Live Action Justice League Movie in 2013?Plus, Bill Murray as FDR, Hailee Steinfeld as Sleeping Beauty, and Jennifer Garner as Miss Marple.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 1, 2011 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup includes lots of news for DC Comics movies (Justice League, Green Lantern and the casting of Lois Lane), new movies for Jennifer Garner, Bill Murray, Hailee Steinfeld and the penguins from Madagascar.This Week’s Top StoryTHIS WEEK IN DC COMICS NEWS: JUSTICE LEAGUE 2013, AND AMY ADAMS AS LOIS LANEThis week gave us big news stories for three different DC Comics movies. The biggest story of the week was the revelation from Warner Bros’ new studio boss Jeff Robinov that the studio plans on releasing a live action Justice League movie in 2013. Back in 2007/2008, the studio was nearing production of a Justice League movie that would have been directed by George Miller (Mad Max, Happy Feet), but it was shelved because of the WGA strike. Warner Bros’ plans for Justice League appear to include at least five of DC Comics’ most popular superheroes: Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and The Flash. It’s not yet known if other Justice League members like Green Arrow, The Atom, Aquaman, Hawkman and Martian Manhunter might also be included. Justice League is being seen as a potential launching pad movie for The Flash and Wonder Woman movies of their own. But the Justice League movie will not connect directly to Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies, or Zack Snyder’s Superman movie coming in late 2012. For Justice League, a new Batman and Superman will be introduced. What is not yet known is whether this will also apply to Green Lantern, or whether Ryan Reynolds might reprise his role in Justice League as well. Speaking of Green Lantern, we learned this week that Michael Clarke Duncan will be providing the voice of the gargantuan Lantern Kilowog, and that Geoffrey Rush will be voicing the bird-like Lantern Tomar-Re. When it comes to DC Comics movie casting, I am burying the lead, because Amy Adams has been cast to play Lois Lane in the tentatively titled Superman: Man of Steel.Fresh Developments This Week#1 HARRY POTTER TO GO BACK TO SCHOOLJ.K. Rowling may have closed the books on Harry Potter, but Warner Bros may not have. Although the studio has adapted Rowling’s seven books into eight movies, with every book, there was much that had to be left out to fit the 4,100 pages of stories to feature length. So, the studio is considering returning to Hogwart’s in a few years (with a new batch of kid actors) to adapt the remaining story elements that were skipped the first time around. The hope is that most of the adult actors will be able to return to reprise their roles. The plan, however, is not to make seven (or eight) more movies, but to condense two or three novels at a time, resulting in a new trilogy of Harry Potter movies. Because the last four novels were the ones that had the most unadapted material, the first film will be called Harry Potter: Years One, Two and Three. The new child actors will be cast to slightly older than Harry Potter is at the beginning, and CGI effects will be used to make them appear younger in the first half of the movie. The three new films will nearly be “sports movies” as it was often the details of Quidditch that were left out of the films.#2 BILL MURRAY’S LATEST CHARACTER IS FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT IN HYDE PARK ON THE HUDSONOver the course of his career, Bill Murray has created some of the most memorable screen characters in movies like Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day, Caddyshack, Ed Wood and Lost in Translation. However, Murray has spent the last several years mostly doing animated voice work (the two Garfield movies and Fantastic Mr. Fox), working with director Wes Anderson, and making cameo appearances (Zombieland). This week brought the news of a new role that will see Bill Murray portraying one of the most recognizable historical figures of the 20th Century, as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (AKA FDR) in the British production Hyde Park on the Hudson. The Focus Features production will tell the true story of FDR’s semi-incestuous love affair with his distant cousin Margaret Stuckley, set during the June 1939 weekend during which King George VI (the lead character in The King’s Speech) and Elizabeth become the first British royals to ever visit the United States. Hyde Park on the Hudson will be directed by Roger Michell (Notting Hill, Morning Glory) from a script by newcomer Richard Nelson, adapting his own 2009 BBC radio play, aired to celebrate the visit’s 70th anniversary. Filming on Hyde Park on the Hudson is scheduled to start in July, 2011. There’s no word yet as to whether Colin Firth or Helena Bonham Carter might reprise their roles in The King’s Speech as King George and Queen Elizabeth.#3 ALAN MOORE FINALLY GETS HIS SAY IN THE MOVIES WITH MIRACLEMANBritish comic book writer (and eccentric) Alan Moore has long been outspoken about the way that his comics have been adapted to film, such as From Hell, V for Vendetta, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Watchmen. Moore will finally get his chance to see one of his earliest works brought to the movies the way he wants. Alan Moore is reportedly considering making the move to being a film director and screenwriter with Miracleman, an adaptation of the early 1980s dark comic book series about a family of superheroes similar to Captain Marvel. The move mirrors the transition that his 1980s “grim and gritty” contemporary Frank Miller made by codirecting Sin City and directing The Spirit. The Miracleman comics are historically significant for the level of graphic violence, gore and social commentary that Moore brought to the superhero genre. Miracleman will be an independent British production, and there is no word yet on who Moore hopes to cast as the key characters of Miracleman and his arch-nemesis Dr. Gargunza.#4 CAN SIR IAN MCKELLEN BRING US PEACE FOR OUR TIME?The success of The King’s Speech has proven that there is still an audience hungry for biopics about significant British historical figures. So, the latest project to be discussed is Peace For Our Time, about British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Chamberlain was Prime Minister from 1937 to 1940 and is most famous (or notorious) for his 1938 signing of the Munich Agreement, which conceded possession of the Sudetenland region of Czechslovakia to Nazi Germany. Chamberlain’s famous quote from that period was that he felt the agreement would result in “peace for our time.” That proved a diplomatic mistake when a year later Germany proceeded with an invasion of Poland, which led to Great Britain declaring war on Germany. There’s no word yet on who will direct Peace For Our Time, but the producers have already begun negotiations with Sir Ian McKellen to play Neville Chamberlain. Peace For Our Time is expected to be nominated in multiple Academy Award categories for whatever year it is eventually released in. It is, after all, a British historical biopic.#5 TRUE GRIT STAR HAILEE STEINFELD JOINS THE FAIRY TALE CRAZE WITH SLEEPING BEAUTYThe success of Alice in Wonderland last year started a gold rush of sorts that has resulted in over a dozen movies nearing production based on similar stories, most of which are public domain fairy tales like Snow White and Hansel and Gretel. One of Disney’s top priorities in this category is Maleficent, which will turn the focus on the studio’s 1959 animated classic’s evil villainess, with Tim Burton possibly directing, and Angelina Jolie sought to star. Disney now has competition, however, as a new Sleeping Beauty spec package is going to auction at the studios this week. This new adaptation of the 1697 French fairy tale by Charles Perrault is also revisionist (written by newcomer Lindsay Devlin), and True Grit star Hailee Steinfeld is already attached to star as Princess Aurora. The biggest difference in this version will be a focus on Aurora herself, as she finds herself trapped in a dream world from which she must try to escape. Although the Sleeping Beauty package has not been sold yet, the studio that is probably the most likely to pick it up is Paramount Pictures. Paramount distributed True Grit, and has already cast Steinfeld in the teen suspense thriller Forgotten, as the studio sees the young actress as a rising star they want to continue doing business with.#6 PEOPLE CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH ANIMATED PENGUINSThe last six years have been a very good time for penguins at the movies, even though most of them weren’t even real. In 2005, the documentary March of the Penguins was a surprise box office hit, and that year also saw the release of DreamWorks Animation’s Madagascar, in which a group of zoo penguins were supporting characters. DreamWorks also released the 12 minute short The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper later that year both in theaters and on DVD. Warner Bros released Happy Feet in 2006 (and Happy Feet 2 comes out 11/18/11), and 2007 saw the release of both Surf’s Up and the direct-to-video Face of the Penguins. The Madagascar penguins were featured even more prominently in 2008’s Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, and they will also return in Madagascar 3 in June, 2012. The DreamWorks’ characters are also a hit on TV, with the Nickelodeon series The Penguins of Madagascar now in its second season. All of that set up leads us to the unsurprising news that DreamWorks Animation has started development on a Penguins of Madagascar feature film about the paramilitary penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Private and Rico. There’s no director or release date set yet for this Madagascar spin-off. Screenwriters Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons, who previously worked together on DreamWorks’ Megamind, have been hired to start working on the Penguins of Madagascar feature length script.Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS GET THEIR OWN MOVIE, BUT THE WASHINGTON GENERALS DO NOTThe Harlem Globetrotters exhibition and comedic basketball team were a pop culture phenomenon in the 1970s, including two Saturday morning cartoons, a variety TV show and various guest appearances. Now, the team’s managers are talking to Warner Bros about how to revive the team’s popularity, inspired partly by the reception given to team members Flight Time and Big Easy on two recent seasons of The Amazing Race. The Globetrotters actually met with most of the Hollywood studios, but the reason that Warner Bros was quickest to jump at the opportunity is that three franchises most associated with The Harlem Globetrotters are all Warner Bros properties, and all three are in a position to be revived. The first movie will be a CGI/live action remake of Scooby-Doo Meets The Harlem Globetrotters, which will reboot the Scooby-Doo movie franchise, including new actors to play Shaggy, Velma, Fred and Daphne. That film is expected to be the first of a trilogy which (if successful) will be followed by adaptations of The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan’s Island and Scooby-Doo Meets Batman, featuring a version of the Caped Crusader that pays homage to the 1960s Adam West TV series.#2 LITTLE MISS MUFFET GETS THE RED RIDING HOOD TREATMENTAs Hollywood continues its love affair with adapting fairy tales (which are also public domain) into live action movies, the latest target for adaptation is one of the most famous: Little Miss Muffet. Summit Entertainment has begun talks about how best to adapt the 28-word rhyme into a feature film that can appeal to the young audience that are fans of their Twilight Saga movies. The movie is expected to start by exploring the lingering questions that Little Miss Muffet leaves us with. Where did Miss Muffet get her curds and whey? Why was she so frightened of spiders? What the %*#@ is a tuffet anyway? The actual encounter with the spider will come midway in the movie, as we are introduced to teen Prince Arachnos, who was cursed with having to live half of his life in spider form. After initially being revulsed by his condition, Miss Muffett eventually falls in love with the spider, but their new romance comes with a price, as her father threatens to deprive Miss Muffet from ever eating curds and whey again, leaving her with a very difficult choice. Summit is hoping to cast Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) as Prince Arachnos, but the casting of Miss Muffet is still ongoing.#1 38-YEAR-OLD JENNIFER GARNER MAKING ELDERLY DETECTIVE MISS MARPLE YOUNG AND HIP?This week obviously ended with April 1st, and we all know what that means. So, when this story hit the news cycle, it seemed like someone had jumped the gun. But nope, this story is 100% real. Walt Disney Pictures has acquired the rights to the elderly detective character Miss Marple, who appeared in twelve novels by Agatha Christie from 1930 to 1976, and was one of Christie’s most famous characters. Disney’s plan is to both modernize Miss Marple (moving the setting to the modern day), and make her much younger. Jennifer Garner, who is currently 38 years old, will play the much young Miss Marple, and Garner is also producing. As Agatha Christie wrote her, Miss Marple was an elderly spinster living in a tiny English village. Several Miss Marple novels have previously been adapted to film, including 1980’s The Mirror Crack’d, in which she was played by Angela Lansbury, who went on a few years later to star in Murder, She Wrote, playing the very similar (but Americanized) character of Jessica Fletcher. As if this story isn’t already strange enough, the writer that Disney has hired to reinvision Miss Marple is Mark Frost, who is most famous for being David Lynch’s cocreator of the bizarre early 1990s ABC TV show Twin Peaks. Mark Frost also cowrote Fantastic Four and its sequel. There’s no word yet which specific Agatha Christie novel will be adapted (or if a specific one will be adapted at all). This is usually the part where I would explain why a movie is the week’s Most Rotten Idea, but I think pretty much this entire story does that job for me quite nicely.P.S.One more thing about Harry Potter, Miracleman, Peace for Our Time, The Harlem Globetrotters, and Little Miss Muffet… April Fool’s!For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"quibi, travel","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-A-Live-Action-Justice-League-Movie-in-2013"},{"id":"47509223238362","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Mountains of Madness for Tom Cruise?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Mountains of Madness for Tom Cruise?Plus new projects for George Clooney and Ryan Reynoldsby Greg Dean Schmitz | September 3, 2010 |  CommentsAs Hollywood types take off this last week of the summer season and possibly prepare for festival trips to Venice, Telluride and Toronto, movie news was particularly slow and sparse. The stories that did emerge include casting rumors for Guillermo del Toro’s next movie and the Fantastic Four reboot, a new World War II epic to be filmed in 3D (of course!), and new roles for Bradley Cooper, Paul Giamatti, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Dwayne Johnson, Chris Pine and Ryan Reynolds. There’s also quite a bit of sequel news for titles like Clash of the Titans 2, Skyline 2 (already!), Unbreakable 2 (though not what you might think) and X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYWILL TOM CRUISE POPULARIZE “LOVECRAFTIAN HORROR” OR IS SOMEONE ELSE WANTED?The phrase “Lovecraftian horror” is used to describe movies with bizarre and creepy monsters, usually with a sense of doom and dread so intense that it causes psychological damage to those involved. Or when done poorly, they’re really just monster movies. The irony is that although there have been tons of horror movies/games/etc that build upon the formula created by early 20th century pulp writer H.P. Lovecraft, there has never been a major studio movie directly based upon one of his actual stories. Earlier this summer, we learned that Guillermo del Toro is using all this extra time that he won’t be using to direct The Hobbit movies to correct that with an adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness. Lovecraft’s novella described a scientific expedition into the mountains of Antartica. The explorers discover a lost city that was apparently built by terrifying ancient creatures (Elder Things and Shoggoths) that may not necessarily be quite extinct yet. James Cameron is also producing At the Mountains of Madness for Universal, and filming in 3D is expected to start in May, 2011. And so that leads us finally to this week’s news, which is the question of who will be starring, and who wants whom. Universal Pictures reportedly wants James McAvoy, who starred in one of the studio’s biggest hits in recent years, Wanted. Guillermo del Toro, on the other hand, is said to be more excited about working with the star with whom he briefly was considering rebooting the Van Helsing franchise: Tom Cruise. This writer has admittedly knocked Tom Cruise around in print a bit in previous columns, but I think Tom Cruise as the star to help bring the Lovecraft/Cthulhu mythos to the mainstream is particularly intriguing. Cruise may have had box office bumps in recent years (most recently Knight and Day), but he remains a much bigger name with most people than James McAvoy. Just imagine Tom Cruise going on a day time talk show and hopping around with excitement as he’s trying to explain what a Shoggoth is. Universal, please make that happen.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 REQUIEM FOR A MUTANT?Two weeks ago, news broke that 20th Century Fox’s search for the director of X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2 had narrowed down to either Robert Schwentke (next month’s Red) or David Slade (The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, 30 Days of Night). Schwentke was considered the likely choice at the time, but now he has apparently dropped out, as another director has joined Slade in the running. And that director is surely a surprise, as Hugh Jackman (in his duty as producer) recently talked to Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) about directing the Wolverine sequel, which will depict Logan’s romantic ninja-fighting adventures in Japan. Aronofsky’s produced movies might make him seem like an odd choice for a Wolverine sequel, but a look at the movies he’s been formerly attached to (Batman: Year One and the Robocop reboot) show that Aronofsky has long wanted to do his own version of a superhero movie. Considering how disappointing X-Men Origins: Wolverine was, the involvement of someone like Darren Aronofsky might be the best way for the character’s new franchise to redeem itself. If Aronofsky does sign, however, the next question would be whether 20th Century Fox would allow the director to make the movie his way, or whether they would interfere, demand changes and generally leave us in the end with a messed up pile of cinematic trash. The last time Aronofsky worked with a studio (The Fountain), that’s sort of exactly what happened. In the meantime, Darren Aronofsky’s next film Black Swan premiered at Venice this week, and the critics are sort of going crazy over it with praise. So, that’s also good news, at least.#2 THE 3D TREND FLIES INTO THE BATTLE OF MIDWAYThe HBO miniseries The Pacific was nominated for an amazing 23 Emmy Awards, and won eight awards, including Outstanding Miniseries on Sunday night. The day before, the news broke that Warner Bros (corporate cousin to HBO) had picked up a pitch from The Pacific co-executive producer Bruce C. McKenna for a $200 million 3D action epic about The Battle of Midway. From June 4 to June 7, 1942, the United States Navy achieved a massive victory against the Japan, defending an attack against the Midway Atoll, a mere six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Japan lost four aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser in the Battle of Midway, which seriously weakened the Imperial Navy’s strength in the Pacific. The battle was previously brought to the big screen in 1976 as Midway, which had an all-star cast including Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, James Coburn, Glenn Ford, Hal Holbrook, Robert Mitchum, Toshiro Mifune and Pat Morita. John Ford also directed a 1942 documentary called The Battle of Midway, which was quickly compiled by Ford and released to help muster morale at home for the war efforts in the Pacific. Warner Bros is fast tracking The Battle of Midway, and screenwriter Robert Schenkkan (cowriter of The Quiet American), who also cowrote four episodes of The Pacific, is expected to turn in the first draft within eight weeks. Akiva Goldsman (Jonah Hex, The Losers, I Am Legend) is producing The Battle of Midway for Warner Bros.#3 DEADPOOL AND FACEMAN TEAMING UP FOR A BUDDY COP MOVIETwo of the most wanted and busiest actors in Hollywood are Ryan Reynolds and Bradley Cooper, and now they are attached to costar together in an untitled buddy cop action movie. The project got its start five years under the title of Blowback as a potential starring vehicle for Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. The story follows two friends who are San Francisco cops whose fathers were also partners in the department, and who are forced out of retirement to help their sons crack a particularly tough case. There’s no word yet as to who will play their dads. The action comedy is said to have “an updated Lethal Weapon flavor that plays into edgier R-rated territory.” The new post-Dwayne-Johnson script was written by screenwriter Sheldon Turner, whose three produced movies couldn’t be much different from each other: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, the remake of The Longest Yard and (with Jason Reitman) Up in the Air. There’s no director for this project yet. There’s also no distributor yet, but it is being co-produced by Benderspink (A History of Violence, The Ruins) and Original Film (I Am Legend, the Fast and the Furious franchise), which has a first look deal at Columbia Pictures. In other Bradley Cooper news, the actor was also replaced this week in the next movie (The Grey) to be directed by Joe Carnahan (The A-Team, Smokin’ Aces) by his much older A-Team costar, Liam Neeson. The Grey is a survival drama about a leader (Liam Neeson) of an oil drilling team whose plane crashes in Alaska, forcing them to fight for their lives against a pack of vicious wolves.#4 GEORGE CLOONEY CASTS UP HIS NEXT MOVIE AS DIRECTORIn addition to being a charming actor and a human rights activist, George Clooney also has a side career as a director (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Good Night and Good Luck, Leatherheads). Clooney’s fourth movie as director will be Farragut North, an adaptation of an off-Broadway play about a fictional presidential campaign during the period leading up to the Iowa Democratic caucuses. The central character of Farragut North is a 20-something campaign worker who at one time Leonardo DiCaprio was attached to play. The word now is that Clooney plans to offer the role to Chris Pine (Star Trek). Brad Pitt had once wanted to play that character’s boss, but Philip Seymour Hoffman is now up for the role instead. Paul Giamatti has also been cast as their opponent’s campaign manager. Evan Rachel Wood and Marisa Tomei are also reportedly being offered roles (Wood as a teen staffer who has an affair with Pine’s character). George Clooney is planning on starting filming Farragut North in February, 2011.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#5 TWO MONTHS BEFORE SKYLINE, SKYLINE 2 ALREADY ON THE HORIZON?Universal Pictures isn’t releasing their alien invasion movie Skyline until November 12, but the producers are already trying to sell the world on a sequel. IM Global, an international distribution company, is seeking to sell Skyline 2 to foreign film distributors next week at the Toronto International Film Festival’s film market. This news comes only three weeks after the trailer first debuted in theaters (with Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World), revealing the premise of alien vessels appearing over Los Angeles, sucking people up into the sky in images that are very similar to the concept of The Rapture. There’s no word yet as to who is writing or would direct Skyline 2, or what the sequel might be about (though it’s probably a good bet that it would possibly involve people being sucked up by alien ships?). The first Skyline was directed by the Brothers Strause (Colin and Greg) (Aliens vs Predator: Requiem) from a script by newcomer screenwriters Liam O’Donnell and Joshua Cordes, who also has had a prolific recent career as an animation and visual effects supervisor on movies like Avatar, Iron Man 2, the two Fantastic Four movies and The Day After Tomorrow. When considering whether Skyline 2 is a “fresh” or “rotten” idea, one has to see the irony that the first trailer was attached to Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, a movie that unfortunately failed at the box office after over a year of high anticipation. Skyline might be a great science fiction movie (or not), and may or may not do well at the box office, and so it seems a bit premature to already be talking about Skyline 2. Skyline 2 is this week’s borderline Rotten Idea only for that reason.#4 CLASH OF THE TITANS SEQUEL MOVES CLOSER TO BATTLEDespite receiving mostly negative reviews, this year’s remake of Clash of the Titans was a huge international hit ($491 million) for Warner Bros, and so the studio is moving ahead with plans for a sequel. One improvement Warner Bros hopes to make with Clash of the Titans 2 is to film the movie in 3D rather than using the postproduction conversion which was a big part (though not the entirety) of why the movie was criticized. The director that Warner Bros has signed for the sequel is Jonathan Liebesman (Darkness Falls, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning), whose next film will be 2011’s Battle: Los Angeles. Sam Worthington and Gemma Atherton are among the actors from the first movie who are expected to return for Clash of the Titans 2. For the sequel, Warner Bros has hired three different screenwriters that the studio considers to be among their current top talent. Dan Mazeau (a new writer whose development credits include The Flash and Jonny Quest) and David Leslie Johnson (Orphan and 2011’s Red Riding Hood) will write the script, and Greg Berlanti (cowriter of Green Lantern) collaborated with the other two writers on the treatment. This story is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas both because of Liebesman’s lackluster resume (especially for a big budget mythological epic) and because the Clash of the Titans sequel seems to be getting a greenlight only because the first movie made a lot of money, and not because, you know… anyone actually loved it.#3 WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNBREAKABLE 2 IS NOW NIGHT CHRONICLES 3 INSTEADWhatever most movie fans might think of the majority of M. Night Shyamalan’s films, the movie that is probably most often singled out as being his most narratively successful is Unbreakable. That film of course starred Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in a reinvention of the superhero genre, years before that same thing was done (arguably not as well) repeatedly in shows/movies like Heroes, Hancock and Kick-Ass. At the time, M. Night said that he envisioned Unbreakable as the first part of a trilogy following Willis’ character, and for the last nine years, fans have been wondering when we might see Unbreakable 2. In the meantime, M. Night Shyamalan has made movies like Lady in the Water, The Happening and The Last Airbender, and started producing The Night Chronicles in which he gives story ideas to new directors for them to make instead (this month’s The Night Chronicles: Devil being the first). Now, M. Night has revealed that he has actually taken the villain and idea for what would have been Unbreakable 2 and rewritten it to instead be the third Night Chronicles movie. The second Night Chronicles movie will be called Twelve Strangers and will be about a jury dealing with a case involving the supernatural. M. Night went on to say that originally this villain was supposed to be in Unbreakable, but he removed the character to avoid having too many villains in one movie (that old Batman/X-Men problem). This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because it means Unbreakable 2, which might still have a chance of being a great movie, is now even further from happening. M. Night himself now says that he has to now come up with a different idea for the sequel. Although it’s possible the third Night Chronicles movie might turn out to be good, I’m not sure many fans will be as excited about it as they would have been about finally seeing a real sequel to Unbreakable.#2 DWAYNE JOHNSON IS NOT QUITE DONE WITH KIDS MOVIES YETThe news that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was returning to action movies with Faster and Fast Five (the fifth movie in the Fast and the Furious franchise) was well received by movie fans who yearn to see Johnson stop making so many silly kids movies (Tooth Fairy being the latest one). This week, Dwayne Johnson signed on with New Line Cinema to star in Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, effectively replacing Brendan Fraser (although as a different character). Like Journey to the Center of the Earth, this sequel is adapting and modernizing another novel by Jules Verne, The Mysterious Island, which is often cited as a primary influence on the hit TV show LOST. Mysterious Island has been adapted a few times before, most notably as a 1961 movie. In Journey 2, Josh Hutcherson’s character from the first movie will be the star, as he goes to a “mythical and monstrous island” searching for his lost grandfather, and taking his mom’s boyfriend (Johnson) along on the ride. Journey 2: The Mysterious Island will be directed by Brad Peyton (Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore) from a script by Richard Outten (Pet Sematary II) and brothers Brian and Mark Gunn (cowriters of the direct-to-video Bring It On Again). Filming of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is scheduled to start in late October at locations in North Carolina and Hawaii (perhaps not coincidentally also where LOST was filmed). This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because it feels like a step backwards for Dwayne Johnson, but also because all of the creative people involved are best known for inferior sequels (Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore, seriously?).#1 MORE THAN FOUR RUMORS ABOUT A MOVIE THAT PROBABLY WON’T BE FANTASTICWhen this writer got started in the online movie news business in 1997 with Upcomingmovies.com, there were only a handful of sites out there, but today, there are dozens, and they’re all scrapping for their piece of buzz that will drive traffic to their URL. One such site is called ComicBookMovie.com, and recently that site has been publishing a constant barrage (ten in the last 16 days) about 20th Century Fox’s planned reboot of Fantastic Four. None of them have been confirmed by another news source yet, and at least one of them (the casting of Stephen Moyer as Doctor Doom) has been debunked. What is most likely happening here is that ComicBookMovie.com does indeed have some sort of inside source, although whether that source is reliable or not might be questionable. Within the studio system, there is often talk about dream casting, and an individual employee might know what names are being thrown around, but that doesn’t always translate into actual signed contracts and the actor eventually starring in the movie. Anyway, here’s the names that are being thrown out there: Adrien Brody or Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Reed Richards, Alice Eve or Amber Heard as Sue Storm, Kevin Pennington (90210) as Johnny Storm and Bruce Willis or Kiefer Sutherland as the voice of the CGI version of The Thing. CBM is also reporting that the directors possibly being considered for the Fantastic Four reboot are Joe Carnahan (The A-Team, Smokin’ Aces), James McTeigue (V for Vendetta, Ninja Assassin) and David Yates (the last four Harry Potter movies). The problem with all three is that they are all known to be either currently busy or soon to be busy with other projects (The Grey, The Raven and postproduction on the last two Harry Potter movies, respectively). This is the week’s most Rotten Idea for two reasons. First, this is yet another case of a big-budget sequel receiving a large number of stories that are basically rumors for the moment (quite common with the Batman franchise, for example). Secondly, there is the very concept of 20th Century Fox making another Fantastic Four movie. As long as the studio continues using these characters every few years, that only delays the possibility of Marvel Studios sometimes regaining the movie rights to characters that arguably deserve to be integrated in with the rest of the Marvel movie universe. That sentiment also of course applies to the Daredevil and X-Men rights at Fox and Spider-Man and Ghost Rider at Sony/Columbia.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"thriller, Teen, kaiju, drama, of, Ice, asian-american, romance, Islander, Comedy, Baby, universe","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Mountains-of-Madness-for-Tom-Cruise"},{"id":"47509223229142","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Mickey Mouse to meet Jack Sparrow?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Mickey Mouse to meet Jack Sparrow?Plus, Christopher Nolan confirms that he'll direct the next Batman.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 1, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup features news about two very different biopics, casting news for Sherlock Holmes 2, and the usual assortment of remakes, video game adaptations (though just one this week) and movies that continue ongoing trends like alien invasions and fairy tale reimaginings.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYMAGIC KINGDOM: MICKEY MOUSE, JACK SPARROW &amp; SNOW WHITE, TOGETHER AT LAST?In 2002, Disney teamed up with Square Enix (the videogame company behind the popular Final Fantasy franchise) for Kingdom Hearts, the first in a new franchise of role-playing games that teamed up classic Disney characters with Final Fantasy characters. Now, the studio has announced plans for Magic Kingdom, a movie project that would do something similar for Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, the various “Princess” characters and other favorites from their many movies and theme park attractions. And the somewhat bizarro theme that they would unite them is the idea of Magic Kingdom being like the Disney version of Marvel’s The Avengers or DC’s Justice League of America. It should definitely be mentioned that Marvel Studios is now under the corporate aegis of Disney, so it’s easy to see a corporate synchronicity there as well. The original Magic Kingdom script was written by Ronald D. Moore, creator of the TV shows Battlestar Galactica and Caprica (Moore also cowrote Star Trek: Generations and Star Trek: First Contact), and took place at Disneyland. Disney reportedly considers Magic Kingdom a “low priority” (meaning it’s probably a few years from happening), but the studio is currently looking for a new writer to build upon Moore’s original script. Other upcoming Disney movies that may tie into Magic Kingdom (or not) include Cinderella, Guillermo del Toro’s The Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise and Tomorrowland movies, Maleficent, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and Snow White and the Seven.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 NOT A SURPRISE: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN TO DIRECT THE NEXT BATMAN MOVIEAlthough the news has shown up everywhere, it shouldn’t really be a surprise to anyone that Christopher Nolan is going to direct the next Batman movie. Speaking to Empire this week, he finally confirmed that it would be his next project, and that there is actually a script now (from Nolan’s brother Jonathan). Although the villain (or villains) in Batman 3 are not yet known, actor Edward Norton spoke out this week about his desire to work with Nolan on the project. Norton was asked about whether he would want to play a villain, or specifically the Riddler, and he was positive about either possibility. Edward Norton made news over his parting of ways from Marvel Studios over his starring role in The Incredible Hulk and the subsequent decision to recast Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner in The Avengers. Edward Norton’s enthusiasm for working with Christopher Nolan is also interesting, considering that the two were once competing for theater space when the two magician movies The Illusionist (starring Norton) and The Prestige (directed by Nolan) came out quite close to each other. In other DC her news, two more names emerged as potential directors for the Superman reboot. First, there is Ben Affleck, who has apparently already met with producers about the job and turned it down. Still in the running (in addition to other directors mentioned last week) is Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream). Aronofsky is an especially interesting candidate, as there was a point much earlier in his career where Aronofsky was actually adapting a Batman “reboot” project for Warner Bros, based upon Frank Miller’s Batman: Year One. That project was eventually shelved, and was eventually replaced by Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins. Now, it appears Aronofsky is back in the running to possibly reboot DC Comics’ other most popular superhero.#2 SAM RAIMI JOINING THE ALIEN INVASION FAD WITH EARTH DEFENSE FORCE?One of the hot new trends coming to theaters in the next few years is the “alien invasion” movie, which includes next month’s Skyline, as well as Battle: Los Angeles and the Battleship movie. Now, Sam Raimi, in his role as producer (not director), is in talks with Warner Bros for an alien invasion movie of his own, tentatively titled EDF, which stands for Earth Defense Force. The script has already been leaked, and the premise starts off with U.S. and Chinese fighter pilots engaged in a dogfight, who are then attacked by three alien ships that then go on to destroy various global landmarks and military installations. NASA soon discovers signs of a much larger invasion force coming from another galaxy in ten months, forcing the goverments of the world to band together to fend off the incoming invasion. The script by Andrew Marlowe (End of Days, Air Force One) is said to combine elements of Top Gun, Independence Day and The Last Starfighter. The next step for EDF will be for Sam Raimi to find a director who can tackle what is potentially a big-budget “event” movie.#3 CAPTAIN SULLY’S HIGHEST DUTY INSPIRES A BIOPICWhen Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger landed his passenger jet in the Hudson River in January, 2009, saving the lives of all 155 people on board, he was instantly hailed as a true American hero (and rightly so). Sullenberger has since penned his memoirs, entitled Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters, which was released earlier this year in May. Flashlight Films and the Kennedy/Marshall Company have now secured the rights to Highest Duty. The producers are eyeing Highest Duty as either a feature film or a TV movie. Sullenberger was hesitant about selling his life story rights was encouraged by fellow pilot Harrison Ford, who suggested “Sully” talk to producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. Their company’s credits include Munich, Seabiscuit and the Bourne movies, and their upcoming releases include Clint Eastwood’s Hereafter and Steven Spielberg’s War Horse. There’s no word yet as to any other creative people involved with Highest Duty, including a screenwriter, director or potential star (though one has to wonder if perhaps Harrison Ford might be in the running for the role).#4 THE MANKIND BIOPIC IS REALLY JUST ABOUT ONE WRASSLERMick Foley is one of the most successful professional wrestlers of the last 20 years, best known as “Mankind” (among other names he’s used) and for performing for several wrestling promotion companies, including the WWE, WCW, NWA, ECW and currently Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Foley has also written several books, including novels, children’s books and four memoirs. Now, Mick Foley is teaming up with producer Jeff Katz (Shoot ‘Em Up, Snakes on a Plane) for a biopic based upon his life story. The untitled biopic will be directed by extreme sports documentarian Christopher J. Scott (Snowblind) from a script Scott is cowriting with Mick Foley. There’s no word yet as to whether Mr. Socko will also make an appearance in the film.#5 BIG TIME HOLLYWOOD PRODUCERS SAY PLAY MYST FOR MELast summer, an independent production company called Mysteria Film Group announced that they had acquired the film rights to the 1996 science fiction novel Myst: The Book of Ti’ana, which was a prequel to the popular PC/Mac video game franchise Myst. Now, the Mysteria Film Group has found new film producers partners in the form of Hunt Lowry (Donnie Darko, The Last of the Mohicans) and Mark Johnson (Galaxy Quest and the Chronicles of Narnia franchise). Lowry and Johnson are also working together on the adaptation of the John Grisham novel The Testament. First introduced in 1993, the various Myst games are interactive puzzle games in which the player explores environments and unlocks the secrets of an extensive game mythology, which is expanded upon in the trilogy of prequel novels. Adapting Myst to the big screen is arguably a daunting challenge (especially since the game’s most popular days are now over 10 years in the past), but the involvement of two Hollywood heavy hitters like Hunt Lowry and Mark Johnson is a promising (and surprising) development for the project. The next step for the Myst adaptation is to find a suitable screenwriter.#6 SHERLOCK HOLMES SOLVES THE MYSTERY OF MORIARTY’S IDENTITYLast year, during the production of Sherlock Holmes, there were reports and rumors that Brad Pitt may have provided the voice of the detective’s great nemesis Professor Moriarty, which would then lead to Pitt costarring in Sherlock Holmes 2. There were also rumors that director Guy Ritchie was possibly trying to get Daniel Day-Lewis to sign on for the role. Now, the actor who will be playing Professor Moriarty has been revealed, and instead of a major film star, the role has instead gone to Jared Harris. Harris (who is also the son of the late actor Richard Harris) has had dozens of film and TV roles, which include appearances in Happiness, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and his supporting role as Lane Pryce in recent seasons of Mad Men. Additionally, this week Stephen Fry (Wilde, V for Vendetta) was also cast as Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s older brother. Mycroft Holmes was depicted by Arthur Conan Doyle as a British government agent with superior detective skills to Sherlock, but lacking the ambition or interest in pursuing cases to the physically demanding extent that his younger brother does. Warner Bros has scheduled Sherlock Holmes 2 for a release date of December 16, 2011.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#3 ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER REVISIONIST FAIRY TALE MOVIE: SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMANSince the blockbuster release of Disney’s Alice in Wonderland earlier this year, 2010 has seen a new wave of plans for movies based on various fairy tales and classic children’s stories. The list is really too long to thumbnail at this point, but perusing the archives of The Weekly Ketchup will surely bring at least one up nearly every week. The latest such project is called Snow White and the Huntsman, and this live-action retelling of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale will, as the title suggests, feature an enhanced role for the Huntsman. Not to be confused with a romantic role (which will still be Prince Charming, although not necessarily called that), the Huntsman will start the film as being ordered to kill Snow White in the woods, but he instead will end up chained to Snow White, on the run, and teaching her how to survive. There’s no word yet what role the seven dwarves will play in this version. Video game commercial director Rupert Sanders (Halo, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) will make his feature film debut, working from a script from Evan Daugherty, also a newcomer to feature films. Snow White and the Huntsman first made the news this week as the object of a studio bidding war, but Universal Pictures quickly emerged as the winner. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because, as mentioned above, it is just the latest of a wave of similar projects, and it’s not even the only revisionist take on Snow White in the works. Also, the “newbie” status of both the screenwriter and director makes their abilities to effectively reinvent a classic tale highly up in the air.#2 STAR WARS: SAME TIME, SAME GALAXY, BUT A NEW DIMENSIONGeorge Lucas has been talking for a while now about his plans to revisit the Star Wars movies with a conversion to 3D, but this week was when the announcement was made official. Releasing the six movies according to story chronology, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace will be the first 3D conversion, in theaters in 2012. The other five movies will follow at unspecified dates, with the frequency of the re-release of each film (once a year? every six months?, etc) not yet known. This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, first of all because The Phantom Menace is considered by many fans to be a blemish to the reputation of the original franchise. There is also the very concept of 3D post-conversion, and the question of whether the technical problems (dim lighting, blurry objects or backgrounds) can be overcome by the benefit of 3D. Finally, there remains the spectre of potential changes that could be made by George Lucas and Lucasfilms as they revisit the original trilogy (yet again). Will Greedo shoot first at Han Solo twice the next time through?#1 TEEN REMAKE FEVER STRIKES ALFRED HITCHCOCKThe films of director Alfred Hitchcock have long been the subject of remakes. Notable examples include the 1998 films A Perfect Murder and Gus Vant’s Psycho remake, as well as 2007’s Disturbia, which was a remake of Rear Window. There have also long been plans to remake The Birds, and many other remake plans that were eventually abandoned. The latest project bears the particularly atrocious title of Teens on a Train, and it is (of course) a remake of 1951’s Strangers on a Train, which was itself an adaptation of the novel by Patricia Highsmith. The teen thriller will be produced by BBC Films and independent British company Slingshot Productions (Tormented, Sugarhouse). Like the source material, Teens on a Train will be about strangers that meet on a train and agree to murder someone for each other. Where this version will depart from the source material (besides the obvious ways) is that one of the two people will be a girl who is also a “raving psychopath.” Teens on a Train was written by Joshua St. Johnson (creator of the UK TV series Material Girl). Filming of Teens on a Train is expected to start in the UK in 2011. The reason for Teens on a Train being the most Rotten Idea of the week should be fairly evident in just the title alone. If there is any good news here, it is that as a British production, there is the possbility that it will never actually be released in the USA.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Paramount, canceled, series, thriller, books, 93rd, Emmy, Esquire, Schmidt, Spectrum, Sundance","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Mickey-Mouse-to-meet-Jack-Sparrow"},{"id":"47509223220947","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Martin Freeman Cast as The Hobbit","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Martin Freeman Cast as The HobbitPlus, Mel Gibson is in and out of The Hangover 2by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 22, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup is full of news about prequels, sequels and remakes. The prequels in the news this week are The Hobbit and X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2, and there’s also news for The Hangover 2 and Iron Man 3. Hollywood’s remake fever continues this week with revisits to The Day of the Triffids, The Forbin Project, The Thin Man and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYMARTIN FREEMAN AND MANY OTHERS ARE CAST IN THE HOBBITFollowing weeks of rumors, Martin Freeman, the star of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and costar of the original, UK version of The Office, has been confirmed as being cast as Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson’s two movies based upon J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit. Martin Freeman is not the only actor to be announced this week, however, as most of the Company of Dwarves has also been cast. British TV actor Richard Armitage (who also has a role as a Nazi in Captain America: The First Avenger) will play Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the company. The selection of Armitage echoes the theme of the other actors playing dwarves; all are relatively obscure actors best known for working in British TV or film. They are: Aidan Turner (Kili), Rob Kazinsky (Fili), Graham McTavish (Dwalin), John Callen (Oin), Stephen Hunter (Bombur), Mark Hadlow (Dori) and Peter Hambleton (Gloin). The dwarf actors join the previously cast Sir Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis, who are reprising their Lord of the Rings roles as Gandalf the Grey and Gollum. Still yet to be cast are a number of human and elf roles, including Elrond (presuming Hugo Weaving is not returning), Beorn and Bard the Bowman. Among the actors who are reportedly in talks about unspecified roles are David Tennant (Doctor Who), Stephen Fry, and Saorise Ronan. Finally, there is Smaug the Dragon, for whom Bill Nighy is reportedly in discussions to provide the voice work. Filming is scheduled to begin on the two Hobbit movies in February, 2010, either in the UK or New Zealand (pending further announcement).FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 SEQUEL TO A ROTTEN MOVIE GETS A FRESH DIRECTOR: WOLVERINE 2The last few weeks have been full of stories about both who will direct the sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and what will be the next movie for director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) following this December’s Black Swan. More recently, those two stories started to come together, with word that Aronofsky was the seemingly unlikely frontrunner for the Wolverine 2 job. This week, Wolverine star Hugh Jackman confirmed that Darren Aronofsky has indeed signed on with 20th Century Fox. Jackman was effusive in his praise for Aronofsky, though he admitted, “well, I would say that, but I really do feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different.” Jackman continued, “this is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He’s kind of dark… but you know, this is a change of pace. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that’ll give you a good clue. [Aronofsky’s] going to make it fantastic. There’s going to be some meat on the bones. There will be something to think about as you leave the theater, for sure.” Darren Aronofsky has long wanted to make his version of a superhero movie, going back several years before Christopher Nolan came aboard the Batman movie, when Aronofsky was developing an adaptation of Frank Miller’s Batman: Year One at Warner Bros. Another quasi-superhero project that Aronofsky was once developing (which has since been abandoned) was a reboot of Robocop at the now-struggling MGM.#2 DISNEY MAKES ANOTHER MARVEL DEAL AND SCHEDULES IRON MAN 3 FOR 2013When Walt Disney Studios acquired Marvel Studios several months ago, a lingering question was what exactly would become of the already announced movies Marvel had planned with Paramount Pictures. Marvel and Paramount had established a good relationship with the first two Iron Man movies, and it was to continue with Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers. This week, Disney paid Paramount $115 million for the transfer of the distribution rights to The Avengers and the planned Iron Man 3, with Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger remaining Paramount releases. Additionally, this announcement also included a May 3, 2013 release date for Iron Man 3, which may make it the first major Marvel Studios movie to be released after The Avengers on May 4, 2012. Other Marvel Studios projects currently in development include Runaways, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man, Nick Fury, Black Widow, Black Panther and Luke Cage.#3 SPIELBERG’S NEXT MOVIE AFTER WAR HORSE WILL BE… ROBOPACLYPSESteven Spielberg is currently filming the World War I drama War Horse, but the acclaimed director has already chosen his next project, which will see him returning to the science fiction genre. Robopocalypse is an upcoming novel (June, 2011) by Daniel H. Wilson about the human race struggling against a robot uprising, which brings to mind movies like I, Robot and the Terminator franchise. Even as it was still being written, screenwriter Drew Goddard (Cloverfield), who also wrote several episodes of LOST, Alias, Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, worked in conjunction with Wilson, receiving novel pages and adapting them into the screenplay. Robopocalypse will be distributed by Disney’s Touchstone Pictures, and Spielberg expects to start filming in January, 2012 for a release in 2013. Although Robopocalypse will be Spielberg’s next film, the reason for the long delay in filming is that he’ll be busy with postproduction on War Horse, and he’ll also have the CGI animated movie Tin Tin: The Secret of the Unicorn in postproduction. Both War Horse and Tin Tin: The Secret of the Unicorn will be released in December, 2011, just five days from each other.#4 WILL JOHNNY DEPP LOSE WEIGHT TO PLAY THE THIN MAN?Although there’s no script yet for the project, Johnny Depp reportedly wants to star in a Warner Bros remake of the 1934 film The Thin Man. Depp’s idea includes recruiting director Rob Marshall (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha), who is currently directing Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. The Thin Man was originally based upon a 1934 detective novel by Dashiell Hammett (The Maltese Falcon), and went on to inspire five more sequels, all of which also starred William Powell and Myrna Loy. There was also a Thin Man TV series on NBC from 1957 to 1959. The Thin Man tells the story of retired private investigator Nick Charles and his wife Nora who return to detective duty after the disappearance of a friend (who is actually the “Thin Man,” not Nick Charles). Since there’s no script for the Thin Man remake yet, the project is probably at least a few years away from happening. In the meantime, Rob Marshall is expected to start talking to Universal soon about possibly directing their planned movie adaptation of the hit musical Wicked.#5 SAM RAIMI EYES THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS REMAKEA few weeks ago, the news of a planned remake of The Day of the Triffids hit the Internet to a tepid reaction from fans. This week, the rights to that remake went up for auction, and they were won by Mandate Pictures, representing Sam Raimi’s Ghost House production company. Mandate reportedly paid more for The Day of the Triffids than for any other project they’ve ever purchased. The reason for the high bid is that Sam Raimi (Spider-Man, The Evil Dead franchise) hopes to direct this remake, as the original movie was one of his favorite films growing up. The Day of the Triffids was a British 1951 science fiction novel by John Wyndham about a bio-engineered species of intelligent plants that take over after a massive meteor shower blinds most of the humans on Earth. The Day of the Triffids was then adapted as a British movie in 1962, and also as two UK TV mini-series, in 1981 and then last year in 2009. When the remake was announced in September, there was talk about The Day of the Triffids being filmed in 3D, but there’s no word yet as to whether Sam Raimi also wants to film it in 3D.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#4 MEL GIBSON GAINS AND THEN LOSES A CAMEO ROLE IN THE HANGOVER 2Mel Gibson made the news twice this week, and both times, it was for the same movie, as his notoriety first helped and then hurt his career, once again. First, the news broke that Gibson was a “done deal” to have a cameo role in The Hangover 2 as a Bangkok tattoo artist. This cameo was to have been the sequel’s version of the cameo that Mike Tyson had in the first movie (as himself). However, this decision by director Todd Phillips did not apparently go over so well with his cast and crew. A few days later, Phillips had to announce that Mel Gibson would not be appearing in The Hangover 2 after all, saying, “I thought Mel would have been great in the movie and I had the full backing of [Warner Bros President] and his team. But I realize filmmaking is a collaborative effort, and this decision ultimately did not have the full support of my entire cast and crew.” As for who specifically in the cast might have objected, the word on the web is that it was Hangover star Zach Galifianakis who most loudly complained about Mel Gibson’s possible participation. This story is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because there’s no way it can possibly be seen as “fresh.” If Gibson had stayed in, that would have been a controversial choice, but announcing and then dropping him doesn’t look so good either. As Deadline writer Mike Fleming points out, this situation is in stark contrast to the cameo given in the first movie to Mike Tyson, who was convicted for rape, and served time in prison for the crime. In other words, Mel Gibson’s reputation for his repeated racist/sexist remarks and behavior now make him lower on Hollywood’s social ladder than a convicted rapist. This news also makes the future of The Beaver, the Jodie Foster-directed movie starring Mel Gibson as a man whose best friend is his beaver hand puppet, even more questionable.#3 M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN HITCHES HIS CAREER TO THE SMITH FAMILYA few months ago, director M. Night Shyamalan was reportedly working on a top secret project that would have starred Bruce Willis, Gwyneth Paltrow and Bradley Cooper. However, no studio apparently wanted to make that project, and so it has now been “quietly shelved.” That bit of bad news is not keeping Shyamalan from trying to find new work, however, and he has found a new friend in Will Smith. Smith’s Overbrook production company has come aboard a project called One Thousand A.E., which apparently has no connection to the animated science fiction film Titan A.E., although it is also a science fiction project. No story details have been revealed yet about One Thousand A.E., but the movie is being seen as a starring vehicle for Will’s son Jaden Smith. There is also an adult lead character, but Will Smith will not be taking that role. One factor that might be the difference between Shyamalan’s recently shelved project and One Thousand A.E. is that unlike that untitled project, One Thousand A.E. was not written by M. Night Shyamalan himself. Instead, One Thousand A.E. was written by screenwriter Gary Whitta, whose first produced film was this year’s The Book of Eli, starring Denzel Washington. One Thousand A.E. is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because of the decreasing reputation that M. Night Shyamalan now has after a string of critical flops to which his name was attached.#2 LET’S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN: A ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW REMAKE?This Tuesday, the FOX TV show Glee will be airing an episode called The Rocky Horror Glee Show, in which the high school characters put on a stage production of the original The Rocky Horror Show for Halloween. Before that episode even airs, Glee creator is already in talks with 20th Century Fox about possibly directing a remake of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The Rocky Horror Show was a British 1973 play which was then adapted as the 1975 20th Century Fox film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The movie tells the story of two young lovers who find themselves stranded in the rain at a mansion populated by an assortment of strange characters, including aliens and a lingerie-clad mad scientist named Frank N. Furter. The long-running movie attracted a loyal following which included people who dressed up as the characters and acted out the movie as it ran. Audence members would also shout back sarcastic and double entendre lines based on what the characters in the movie were saying. The idea of a Rocky Horror Picture Show remake is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas for nearly the same reason that 20th Century Fox is considering remaking it. The studio looks at the $100 million that the original movie has made in its 35 year theatrical run, and wants to possibly double that potential revenue with an update. However, the fact that The Rocky Horror Picture Show can keep bringing in audiences is also the very reason it doesn’t need to, and shouldn’t be, remade.#1 MCG WANTS TO GIVE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS THE 300 LOOKBritish industrialist Richard Branson and his Virgin brand name have tackled the music industry, record stores, airlines and soon are expanding into commercial space travel with Virgin Galactic Airways. Now, Richard Branson is also looking to get into the movie business with the news that he has acquired a script called Columbus about the famous discoverer’s voyage to and conquest of the Americas. McG (Charlie’s Angels, Terminator: Salvation) is attached to direct Columbus, which is described as doing for Christopher Columbus and his conquistadors what 300 did for the Spartans and the Battle of Thermopylae. The Columbus script was adapted by newcomer screenwriter T.S. Nowlin, who does not yet have any movies to his credit. Columbus is likely to be first major feature film based on Christopher Columbus since the early 1990s when Christopher Columbus: The Discovery and Ridley Scott’s 1492: Conquest of Paradise both bombed at the box office, regardless of that year’s 500th anniversary status. Columbus is actually the second film project for Branson’s Virgin Produced company, following their currently untitled sketch comedy movie which has dozens of stars as its cast. Columbus is this week’s most Rotten Idea because McG and his bombastic visual style, especially if they’re setting out to be “300 style”, seems an odd choice for the tale of Christopher Columbus. Does the mentioning of 300 mean that the conquistadors will be filmed in slow motion action poses, for example?For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Book, toronto, TV, new, Acorn, Red, Us, Lifetime, guild, ITV, cancelled, Stephen, Masterpiece","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Martin-Freeman-Cast-as-The-Hobbit"},{"id":"47509224795883","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Sam Jackson reveals Nick Fury plans","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Sam Jackson reveals Nick Fury plansPlus, new roles for Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrellby Greg Dean Schmitz | May 14, 2010 |  CommentsThis week, the Cannes Film Festival got started, and as it does every year, that means that dozens of movies were either announced or had casting news. A few stars (including Brad Pitt, Colin Farrell, Jennifer Aniston) actually had multiple projects announced this week. There’s also news about movies based upon board games and video games, as usual, two biopics about Marilyn Monroe, and the surprising plans to send 19th Century adventurer Allan Quatermain… into the future.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 IRON MAN 2 FILMMAKERS TALK IRON MAN 3 AND A NICK FURY MOVIEThe movie season of the Summer of 2010 got its start last week with the opening of Iron Man 2, and as the stars did press for that movie, they dropped new information about related upcoming projects. First, there is Iron Man 3, which has been known to be pretty much a sure thing at some point after 2012’s The Avengers. Director Jon Favreau confirmed that in Iron Man 3, he hopes to finally bring the Mandarin, arguably Iron Man’s most iconic villain into the mix (after being hinted at in the first movie). What Favreau is currently struggling with is how to portray the Mandarin, who in the comics wears ten rings, each of which give him a different super power. Favreau calls them “magical,” but their Marvel Comics origin is actually from an alien spaceship. Samuel L. Jackson also revealed this weekthat there are plans, after The Avengers, for Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. to get their own movie. In addition to Jackson as Nick Fury, a S.H.I.E.L.D. movie might also feature Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson and Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow (and she’s also a strong contender to be a member of The Avengers as well). Jackson also said that War Machine (Don Cheadle) is “gonna show up a lot.” As for other movies based on Marvel characters (though not produced by Marvel Studios), there is X-Men: First Class. This week, we learned who the writers working on X-Men: First Class are. First, there is the writing team of Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz, who cowrote Agent Cody Banks, and have also written episodes of Fringe and Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The details are unclear, but it appears that Miller and Stentz got the latest version of the script started, and they are now being joined in rewrites by Jane Goldman. Goldman’s involvement is unsurprising, as she cowrote (with director Matthew Vaughn) both Stardust and Kick-Ass. Vaughn might need Goldman’s help in getting the script done quickly, as Fox’s June 3, 2011 release date is only getting closer.#2 ADAM SANDLER WANTS TO TURN YOUR WORLD INTO A VIDEO GAMELast month, director Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) tweeted about a video on YouTube called Pixels, and the video quickly became something of an Internet phenomenon. In the creative short film created by Patrick Jean, New York City is invaded and transformed by a variety of characters and images from the classic 1980s era of video games. Included in the invasion are Pac-Man, Frogger, Donkey Kong, Tetris, Space Invaders and the paddles from Breakout. And now, Adam Sandler’s Happy Madison is developing Pixels as a movie, with talks ongoing at Columbia, where Happy Madison has a first-look deal. There is no writer involved with Pixels yet, but the plan is to “make a Ghostbusters-style action comedy in which characters come out of a video game to wreak havoc in the real world.” This is a project that might have ordinarily ended up in the Rotten Ideas section, but Patrick Jean’s short film really is quite awesome, presuming Jean (if hired) can work the same sort of magic on a feature-length film.#3 COLIN FARRELL’S EYEBROWS TO LOOM ABOVE VAMPIRE FANGS IN FRIGHT NIGHTThis was a big week in casting news for Colin Farrell, with the Irish star announced for three different movies. First, there is the DreamWorks remake of 1985’s Fright Night, which is normally listed as a “Rotten Idea,” but Farrell’s involvement is a surprise, and possibly a sign that Fright Night might only suck blood. Farrell wil play vampire Jerry Dandridge who is investigated by his teenage neighbor, played by Anton Yelchin. Toni Collette is also costarring in an unspecified role (but I’m guessing she might play Yelchin’s mom). Fright Night will be directed by Craig Gillepsie (Lars and the Real Girl, Mr. Woodcock). Colin Farrell will also star (along with Marion Cotillard) in Cosmopolis, an adaptation of the novel by Don DeLillo. Cosmopolis tells the story of 24 hours in the life of a multi-millionaire as he loses all of his wealth during a long limousine ride across Manhattan. Cosmopolis will be directed by David Cronenberg (Eastern Promises, A History of Violence) on a budget of $20.5 million. Filming will start in March, 2011 in New York City and Toronto. Colin Farrell’s third new movie this week is Horrible Bosses, which you can read more about in the #7 spot.#4 THIS WEEK IN BRAD PITT NEWS: THE TIGER AND MONEYBALLFocus Features, Brad Pitt’s Plan B and Darren Aronofsky’s Protozoa Pictures are teaming up to adapt the upcoming non-fiction book The Tiger by John Vaillant. The Tiger tells the true story of the 1997 hunt for a man-eating tiger in Russia’s far east wilderness. The Tiger is being adapted by Guillermo Arriaga (Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel), which may make it the first major film that Arriaga has written that will not be directed by his frequent collaborator, Alejandro González Iñárritu. Brad Pitt is expected to star in The Tiger, but it is unclear whether this would be a directing project for Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) or whether he will just be producing. Brad Pitt has also been confirmed as starring in Columbia Pictures’ Moneyball, based upon the baseball non-fiction bestselling book. Bennett Miller (Capote) is now attached to direct, following the departure of Steven Soderbergh last year just days away from the start of filming. Jonah Hill is also attached to star, and Robin Wright (no longer a Penn, by the way) and Philip Seymour Hoffman are in talks to to appear as well. Filming of Moneyball is now scheduled to start in Los Angeles in July, 2010.#5 MARILYN MONROE BIOPICS COMPETING FOR YOUR BLONDE BOMBSHELL-LOVING ATTENTIONHollywood has a long history of dueling projects, as competing producers race with each other to see who can get their project out first. This has even happened within the field of biopics, such as with Truman Capote (Capote vs Infamous), and the various continuing attempts to make movies based on the lives of Janis Joplin, Linda Lovelace and Jimi Hendrix. This week at Cannes, two different Marilyn Monroe biopics were announced, and both plan to start filming in the next several months. Naomi Watts will star in Blonde, an adaptation of the imaginary Monroe memoir by Joyce Carol Oates. Blonde will be directed by Andrew Dominik (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford). Filming of Blonde is scheudled to start in January, 2011 on a budget of $20 million. The Weinstein Company might get the jump on Blonde, however, as they plan on filming My Week With Marilyn in late September. Michelle Williams will play Marilyn in this story about the time Monroe spent in England filming The Prince and the Showgirl opposite Laurence Olivier. Scarlett Johansson had at one time been in talks to star before Williams signed on. My Summer with Marilyn will be the first feature film for British director Simon Curtis, who has worked mostly on TV projects like David Copperfield.#6 THE THREE MUSKETEERS 3D GETS CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN THREE CAST MEMBERSNormally, a new movie directed by Paul W.S. Anderson would almost automatically get listed as a “Rotten Idea,” but The Three Musketeers 3D now has a pretty great cast. The title characters will be played by Ray Stevenson (Punisher: War Zone, Rome) as Porthos, Luke Evans (Apollo in Clash of the Titans) as Aramis and Matthew MacFadyen (the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood) as Athos. Luke Evans is also in talks this week to star with Jessica Biel in Vivaldi, a romantic biopic about the famed classical composer. Logan Lerman, who had been rumored to be a contender to star in the reboot of Spider-Man is instead in talks to play D’Artagnan, the “fourth” musketeer (which conflicts with the Spider-Man filming schedule). Also cast are Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds) as Cardinal Richelieu and Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale and Draco from Clash of the Titans) as Rochefort. An offer is also out to Orlando Bloom to play the film’s villain, the Duke of Buckingham. Finally, and to no surprise, there is Milla Jovovich, AKA Mrs. Paul W.S. Anderson and a frequent star of his movies, as Milady de Winter, a former lover of Athos, who is being described as a “17th century Bond girl.” Filming of Anderson’s project starts in August, which puts it in competition with another Three Musketeers project to be directed by Doug Liman (Mr. and Mrs. Smith) which also is aiming to start filming this fall. Also this week, soon after this casting announcement, Summit Entertainment picked up The Three Musketeers 3D, and the studio is aiming for a summer, 2011 release date.#7 THIS WEEK IN JENNIFER ANISTON NEWS: HORRIBLE BOSSES AND WANDERLUSTJennifer Aniston was announced in connection to two different comedies this week. First, there’s Horrible Bosses, a New Line Cinema comedy about a group of friends who agree each other’s mean employers. Jason Bateman and Charlie Day (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) will play two of the friends, and Jennifer Aniston signed and Colin Farrell in talks to play two of the bosses. With Fright Night and Cosmopolis, this is the third movie that Colin Farrell was connected to this week. Jamie Foxx also costars as a scam artist named “Motherf***er Jones” who gives murder advice to the three friends. Horrible Bosses will be directed by Seth Gordon (The King of Kong, Four Christmases) from a script cowritten by John Francis Daley, who as a teenager played Sam Weir in Freaks and Geeks. Jennifer Aniston’s second new comedy this week is Wanderlust, in which she and Paul Rudd play a couple who leaves the city to join a commune out in the country. Wanderlust is being produced by Judd Apatow, and will be directed by David Wain (Role Models, Wet Hot American Summer). Wain also cowrote Wanderlust along with fellow The State member Ken Marino.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#3 WILL TIM BURTON BRING FORTH A MONSTERPOCALYPSE?DreamWorks has acquired the screen rights to the board game Monsterpocalypse, and is talking to the already very busy Tim Burton about being “the creative catalyst.” Monsterpocalypse is a collectible miniatures game in which a variety of giant monsters fight in a large city filled with skyscrapers, as an homage to kaiju movies like Godzilla. DreamWorks’ development of Monsterpocalypse is especially interesting given the studio’s concurrent development of a movie based upon the novel Robocalypse, about a robot invasion. The similar titles suggest that DreamWorks might be envisioning the two movies as some sort of franchise, even though they come from two completely different sources and have no other connection other than their titles. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because it’s yet another entry in Hollywood’s recent love affair with board game movies. And also because Monsterpocalypse is difficult to spell.#2 ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON TAKING AUDIENCES FOR A RIDESony Pictures Animation has picked up the rights to the Atari PC game franchise RollerCoaster Tycoon. RollerCoaster Tycoon is a game that simulates the management of an amusement park, with players designing their own roller coasters and other park attractions. The franchise has brought in over $300 million in sales for Atari and includes the third best-selling PC title of all time in the U.S. Harald Zwart (The Pink Panther 2, the Karate Kid remake) is producing with an eye towards possibly directing RollerCoaster Tycoon as a live-action/CGI hybrid movie. Screenwriters David Ronn and Jay Scherick (cowriters of Norbit, I Spy) have been hired to adapt RollerCoaster Tycoon after working on Sony’s upcoming The Zookeeper, starring Kevin James and a large cast of stars voicing the animals in a zoo. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because it is comparable to the recent drive by Hollywood to adapt board games as movies. As a game, RollerCoaster Tycoon is a simulation game with no real narrative other than the idea of the player creating their own theme parks. This makes for a fun video game experience, but doesn’t seem like a particularly great idea for a movie that has to have a narrative element.#1 ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND KING SOLOMON’S MINES… IN THE FUTUREH. Rider Haggard’s Allan Quatermain was a 19th century Victorian era hero known mostly for his exploits in the wilds of Africa in books like King Solomon’s Mines. The character was also one of the key influences of Indiana Jones, and one of the members of Alan Moore’s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. What Allan Quatermain was not was a futuristic adventurer from outer space, but that’s exactly what DreamWorks has in mind. Sam Worthington (Avatar, Clash of the Titans) has signed to star in Quatermain, which will be set in a future after humans have left Earth. The future version of Allan Quatermain will return to Earth on a King Solomon’s Mines-style adventure, but on a planetwide scale. This highly revisionist take on Quatermain was written by Mark Verheiden (Timecop, My Name is Bruce), and doesn’t yet have a director. Quatermain is this week’s most Rotten Idea because it is so completely different from the premise of H. Rider Haggard’s classic adventure character. Imagine if DreamWorks was announcing a new movie called Indiana Jones, but it would be an archaelogist from outer space exploring Earth in the distant future, and you get an idea of what they’re basically saying this Quatermain project is. The concept might have promise as an original story, but by calling it Quatermain, DreamWorks is twisting Haggard’s character completely out of context.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Studios, BET, BET, story, parents, Channel, Golden, Academy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Sam-Jackson-reveals-Nick-Fury-plans"},{"id":"47509224764127","title":"Weekly Ketchup: James Cameron &amp; Guillermo Del Toro Collaborate","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: James Cameron &amp; Guillermo Del Toro CollaboratePlus, an Alien prequel, a reboot of The Crow, and casting news for Denzel, Streep, and Worthingtonby Greg Dean Schmitz | July 30, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes news about the latest entries in the Alien, The Crow and Total Recall franchises, more news about what people associated with Lost and Star Trek have in the works, and new roles for Russell Brand, Tina Fey, Meryl Streep, Justin Timberlake, Denzel Washington and Sam Worthington.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYJAMES CAMERON HELPING GUILLERMO DEL TORO REACH THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESSSince Guillermo del Toro left the Hobbit prequels, it seems that nearly every week has had news about the director’s future. Last week, the big news was that he was writing and producing a new Haunted Mansion movie for Disney. That, however, is not del Toro’s next film as director, which is probably what fans are most excited to discover. This week, James Cameron came aboard to produce (for Universal Pictures) one of del Toro’s long-planned dream projects: H.P. Lovecraft’s At the Mountains of Madness. The 1931 novella is widely considered to be the core story of Lovecraft’s “Cthulhu Mythos,” as it depicts an expedition to Antarctica that discovers a bizarre, ancient city created by an ancient race of creatures that worshipped terrifying gods, the mere knowledge of which can turn a human being insane. Lovecraft’s stories have had a huge influence on pop culture (especially in recent years), but there has never been a major, big-budget studio movie based directly upon one of his Cthulhu stories. Guillermo del Toro’s At the Mountains of Madness will be a 3D production, and Guillermo del Toro will start pre-production soon, and plans to start filming in the summer of 2011. At the Mountains of Madness has long been one of several projects vying to be GDT’s next after The Hobbit. One of the other projects is a Frankenstein film for which makeup tests are already being prepared (even though it won’t be his next film). Del Toro has also revealed that the recent talks about him possibly working on a new Van Helsing movie never went anywhere, and that project won’t be happening.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 LOST‘S DAMON LINDELOF REWRITING THE ALIEN PREQUELProducer/writer Damon Lindelof has taken his first new job since wrapping up the six seasons of Lost, and it’s another high-profile project that joins two others already in the works (he’s cowriting Cowboys &amp; Aliens and Star Trek 2. Lindelof signed a deal with 20th Century Fox to do rewrite work on the Alien prequel that Fox hopes will be Ridley Scott’s next project as director. The meeting in which Lindelof discussed his Alien ideas also produced a concept that could end up being a “free-standing science fiction film” (ie, a movie that’s not a sequel/remake/adaptation, gasp!). Many fans credit Lindelof as being the real brainchild behind what made Lost work, and those fans are most likely very excited to see whatever Lindelof will deliver on the big screen next. Michael Bay also made alien-related news this week, picking up a spec script pitch that is being referred to as the Confidential Alien Project. Bay’s Platinum Dunes will produce the project, the premise of which is being kept secret. Confidential Alien Project was sold on the strength of a treatment and a two-minute teaser trailer by screenwriting newcomer Bobby Glickert.#2 THE CROW REBOOT IS GETTING A REWRITE FROM HAPPY-GO-LUCKY NICK CAVENick Cave is primarily known as a singer/songwriter with a penchant for dark and sometimes depressing lyrics about themes like murder, violence, death and religion. However, Cave is also getting more and more involved with film, having written The Proposition, cowritten Ghosts… of the Civil Dead and writing the scores for movies like The Road and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Nick Cave’s latest screenwriting project will be the rewriting of the planned reboot of The Crow, based upon the comic book by James O’Barr, and which has also inspired four previous movies. Nick Cave will be rewriting the existing script by director Stephen Norrington (Blade, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen). The reboot of The Crow is currently an independent project being produced by Ed Pressman (American Psycho, Thank You for Smoking, Wall Street), who also produced the previous four movies.#3 J.J. ABRAMS TO TELL US THE STORY OF HISTORY’S FIRST GREAT ROBOT, BOILERPLATEJ.J. Abrams and Bad Robot (Lost, Star Trek) have picked up the rights (with Paramount Pictures) to the recent picture book Boilerplate: History’s Mechanical Marvel by Paul Guinan and Anina Bennett. Boilerplate tells the story of the world’s first robot who, in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, went on a series of adventures and military missions. During those travels, Boilerplate met and fought alongside figures like Teddy Roosevelt, Pancho Villa and Lawrence of Arabia. Except, of course, that Boilerplate is completely fictional, so this is very much a work of alternative history. There is already a trailer for the book, which does a great job of giving you an idea of what the adventures in the movie will most likely involve.#4 DENZEL WASHINGTON MIGHT BE THE WHITE HOUSE’S BUTLERDirector Lee Daniels (Precious) has spent much of 2010 preparing the civil rights drama Selma, but problems finding financing appear to be leading Daniels to finding another similarly-themed project. Daniels has signed a deal with Sony Pictures to rewrite and direct the true story drama The Butler. Denzel Washington has also been approached about starring. The Butler is based upon the true story of Eugene Allen, a White House servant who served under eight different presidents (Truman to Reagan) during his 34-year career. Allen died earlier this year at the age of 90, but not before living to be invited to Barack Obama’s swearing in, which was symbollic of the civil rights changes that have happened since Allen first started working at the White House under segregation. The first draft of The Butler was written by Danny Strong (HBO’s Recount).#5 TINA FEY WILL BE CALLING MERYL STREEP MOMMYSony Pictures has picked up the rights to Mommy &amp; Me, a comedy starring Meryl Streep and Tina Fey as a mother-daughter pair in an unrevealed premise. Actor Stanley Tucci will be directing Mommy &amp; Me, which will be his fourth film as director after Big Night, The Impostors and Blind Date. The Mommy &amp; Me treatment was written by Joby Harold (2007’s Awake). Stanley Tucci has previously costarred with Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada and Julie &amp; Julia, but there’s no word yet as to whether Tucci will also be appearing in Mommy &amp; Me, or if he will just be directing. Both Tina Fey and Meryl Streep have had a string of comedy hits in recent years, and so the pairing of the two actresses in the same movie has a great deal of potential.#6 JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE IS BRINGING MORTAL BACKJustin Timberlake’s acting career is continuing along nicely, with four upcoming movies (The Social Network, Yogi Bear, Bad Teacher, Friends with Benefits) now joined by a fifth, and a starring role at that. Timberlake has been offered the lead role in the science fiction action film I’m.mortal by 20th Century Fox. I’m.mortal is set in a future where people can live forever as long as they can afford it. Timberlake would play a man who is on the run, trying to avoid his death, and Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia!) is already attached to play a woman that he kidnaps along the way. I’m.mortal was written by and will be directed by Andrew Niccol, who directed Gattaca, S1m0ne and Lord of War, and also wrote The Truman Show. Gattaca and The Truman Show in particular seem to suggest the type of “thinking man’s genre movie” that I’m.mortal might be.#7 SAM WORTHINGTON IS THE MAN ON A LEDGESam Worthington is steadily accruing new roles, including Dracula Year Zero, Quatermain and Dan Dare, in addition to Avatar 2 and Clash of the Titans 2. The latest job for Worthington is the starring role in Man on a Ledge, a police thriller about a former NYPD officer who threatens to jump to his death, and the female psychologist who tries to talk him out of it. The premise suggests a movie like Phone Booth that is set primarily in one place, but perhaps much of the movie will be told in flashbacks (or something similar). Man on a Ledge was written Pablo Fenjves, whose filmography to date consists of several TV movies like Trophy Wife and The Devil’s Child. The Summit Entertainment release will be directed by Asger Leth, codirector of the 2006 documentary Ghosts of Cite Soleil.#8 RUSSELL BRAND MOVES ON FROM DUDLEY MOORE TO ERROL FLYNNAfter playing the same character twice in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek, Russell Brand recently began filming the remake of Arthur, no doubt reinventing the classic Dudley Moore character with his own style. Now, it appears that Russell Brand wants to do the same with the type of old-school swashbuckling swordsman characters once popularized by actors like Errol Flynn, Douglas Fairbanks and more recently, Johnny Depp. Russell Brand is in talks to star with 20th Century Fox in Hawkwood, an action comedy about 14th century mercenary John Hawkwood. Hawkwood and his White Company achieved fame and notoriety primarily in Italy by fighting for various factions, repeatedly switching sides to whomever paid the highest price. It was Russell Brand who first heard about John Hawkwood, and it was his suggestion that got the project started. The Hawkwood script is being written by Jared Stern, who contributed story material to Disney’s Bolt and The Princess and the Frog.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK#1 UNDERWORLD DIRECTOR SIGNS ON FOR THE TOTAL RECALL REMAKEHollywood’s recent remake frenzy includes several arguably unnecessary projects, and one of them is Total Recall, since Paul Verhoeven’s original 1990 film still holds up and is considered by many to be one of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s best films. Len Wiseman (Underworld, Live Free or Die Hard) is in advanced talks with Columbia Pictures to direct the Total Recall remake. Total Recall was based upon the Philip K. Dick novella We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, and involves a man whose attempt to have memories of a visit to Mars implanted reveals that he is actually an undercover government assassin. The Verhoeven movie differed from the novella by having the character actually travel to Mars. The remake is being written by Kurt Wimmer (Salt, Equilibrium, Ultraviolet), and is being described as a “contemporized” adaptation of Total Recall. Since neither memory implants nor the colonization of Mars are particularly “contemporary” (yet!), this is most likely intended to mean that the movie will feel like one made in the 2010s rather than in 1990. This is this week’s most Rotten Idea because Total Recall simply does not need to be remade. The success of Inception might have some influence in Columbia Pictures’ decision to proceed with this remake, but there are still plenty of other Philip K. Dick stories (and those of other, similar authors) that could be adapted, rather than just remake a movie that still works.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"romance, HBO, fiction, Logo, jurassic, Awards, SDCC, Pictures, Walt, dogs, television","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-James-Cameron-and-Guillermo-Del-Toro-Collaborate"},{"id":"47509224790760","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Guillermo del Toro gives up on The Hobbit","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Guillermo del Toro gives up on The HobbitPlus casting news for a new Avenger.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 4, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes big news for the two movies based upon J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit, casting news for Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, biopics about the lives of Tupac Shakur and Rush Limbaugh, and news about potential third movies in the Sex and the City and Three Men and a Baby franchises.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYTHERE AND BACK AGAIN: WHY GUILLERMO DEL TORO LEAVING THE HOBBIT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A GOOD THINGThe big news this past weekend, which continued to reverberate through the week, was the announcement by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan’s Labyrinth) that he is stepping down as the director of the upcoming two movies adapting J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit. Del Toro has spent two years getting the movies ready, but ongoing delays mostly due to MGM’s financial woes appear likely to push the start of filming back even further. Del Toro will, however, continue working on the scripts with Lord of the Rings cowriting partners Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh. The next step is for Jackson and Del Toro to meet with studio executives as the search begins for a replacement director. Although we will never see what The Hobbit as directed by Guillermo del Toro himself would have looked like, his stamp will undoubtedly remain on the projects, as a great deal of preproduction has been completed under his supervision in New Zealand. The resulting news for movie fans, however, is not all necessarily negative. Over the last few years, Guillermo del Toro has also accumulated a massive movie development slate, and leaving The Hobbit means that some of those movies are now more likely to be made soon, rather than in something like 2013 as would have previously been the case. In addition to potential “personal projects” (like Pan’s Labyrinth and The Devil’s Backbone), Guillermo del Toro’s slate includes adaptations of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, H.P. Lovecraft’s At the Mountains of Madness, Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five and the Dan Simmons novel Drood, which is about Charles Dickens’ secret life as a Victorian Era detective.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL SUPERHERO MOVIE NEWS: HAWKEYE MAKES HIS MARKAfter months of rumor and speculation, Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker) is now in final negotations with Marvel Studios to costar in The Avengers as the archer superhero Hawkeye. Renner’s casting as Hawkeye is significant because it is the first casting for the movie for a character who won’t be seen in another Marvel movie beforehand. Other Avengers members that will have appeared in other movies by the time that The Avengers is released on May 4, 2012 include Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). Samuel L. Jackson will also have an important role in The Avengers as S.H.I.E.L.D. head Nick Fury, who brings the group together. Neal McDonough (HBO’s Band of Brothers) is also in talks to join the cast of Captain America: The First Avenger this week as Dum-Dum Dugan, who fans may remember as both a cigar-chewing, bowler-wearing member of Nick Fury’s Howling Commandos and after World War II, S.H.I.E.L.D. That, however, was in the original comics, where there wasn’t such a big gap between World War II and the 1960s. It’s not yet known whether Dum-Dum Dugan will just be seen in the World War II story, or if he will somehow appear in modern times as well. Finally, the Internet nerd community greeted this week the arrival of our first full glimpses of the costumes of both Captain America and Thor. It should be noted that these images are technically costume concept art, and the finished product may look different. This is especially true of Captain America, who is known from earlier script reviews to undergo at least one major costume change in Captain America: The First Avenger, and there may be a third costume later in the script as well. Having said that, the Thor image at least seems to match the previously released first official image.#2 THIS WEEK IN WB COMIC BOOK MOVIES: NO JOKER IN BATMAN 3; GIANT PLANS FOR 3 STORYAlthough we don’t yet know which villain(s) will be in Christopher Nolan’s next Batman movie, Nolan let the world know which one won’t be: The Joker. The obvious reason, of course, is that Heath Ledger sort of defined the role for this generation. Warner Bros has also picked up the rights from Dark Horse Comics to the independent graphic novel called 3 Story: The Secret History of the Giant Man by Matt Kindt. 3 Story is a “modern fable, exploring the life of a giant man, Craig Pressgang, whose strange medical condition causes continuous growth… from birth to his eventual three-story height.” The screenwriter tasked with adapting the “arty” and “downbeat” story is Dustin Lance Black, who won the Oscar for original screenwriting for Milk, and whose Hoover biopic will be directed by Clint Eastwood. Black made his directorial debut with the independent drama What’s Wrong With Virginia (starring Emma Roberts and Jennifer Connelly), and he is also signed to direct 3 Story.#3 DANIEL CRAIG MIGHT INVESTIGATE THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOOWith his Facebook drama The Social Network not yet released, director David Fincher (Zodiac, Fight Club) is already preparing his next movie. Daniel Craig is reportedly in talks with Fincher to star in his English-language adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the first in a trilogy of Swedish detective novels. The Millennium Trilogy, written by Stieg Larsson (and published posthumously after his 2004 death), details the cases of an unlikely investigative team of a middle-aged journalist and an eccentric female computer hacker with a photographic memory. In addition to Daniel Craig, Brad Pitt has also reportedly expressed interest in the reporter role. The casting of the young computer hacker is still underway, but the actresses who are interested reportedly include Carey Mulligan (An Education), Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman. David Fincher plans on starting filming in October, 2010, and Columbia Pictures is already planning on a December, 2011 release.#4 TUPAC BIOPIC GETTING RESURRECTEDPlans for a biopic about slain rapper Tupac Shakur have been in the works for several years now, but it appears the movie will finally start filming this September. That’s the word, at least, from director Antoine Fuqua (King Arthur, Training Day). Just last week, Fuqua had been revealed as the director of an upcoming Bruce Willis prison escape movie called The Tomb, but that movie will apparently have to wait. Tupac Shakur was, of course, a rapper who got his career started as a member of Digital Underground before going solo as 2Pac and then Tupac. Shakur was also shot five times in 1994, then served 11 months in prison for sexual assault, and was finally shot again in Las Vegas, this time fatally. Tupac Shakur has also already been the focus of over a dozen (!) documentary films, including the Academy Award nominated 2003 film Tupac: Resurrection.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#4 RUSH LIMBAUGH: THE (UNAUTHORIZED) MOVIEOnce upon a time, when you said “Rush,” people thought you were talking about an awesome Canadian rock group who did that song about Tom Sawyer. Today, people are more likely to follow a word association game of Rush with… Limbaugh. Love him or hate him, Rush Limbaugh’s impact on political talk radio over the last 20 years is indisputable. And now, a producer/screenwriter named James Sclafani has optioned the rights to the unauthorized biography The Rush Limbaugh Story: Talent on Loan from God from author Paul Colford. Sclafani has no produced credits, but he did sell his script Counter Kid to Bill Murray’s production company. Sclafani is now shopping his Rush Limbaugh script around for financing. Sclafani says that his script is a “close cousin” to Oliver Stone’s W. about George W. Bush, and include the contradictions between Rush’s stances on the military and drugs and Rush’s own personal experiences. Sclafani put it this way, “This is Citizen Kane meets Private Parts, where you have a man who always had trouble relating to people in the outside world, but does it effortlessly in the booth.” This project is only marginally in the Rotten Idea category, mostly because what someone thinks about an unauthorized biography of Rush Limbaugh probably depends upon well, lots of things. If you’re one of Rush’s Dittoheads, then you probably see this as yet another liberal attack on the right. If you don’t care for Rush, then perhaps this is a movie that you would like to see. Regardless of all that, Sclafani is also an unproven talent at this point, and so that’s just enough to push this story into the Rotten Idea category.#3 THE MYSTERIOUS CASE OF THE VERONICA MARS MOVIE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO A CLOSEIn three years since Veronica Mars went off the air after three years on UPN and The CW, there has been regular talk about a possible movie spinoff. Kristen Bell starred in the TV series as the titular Veronica Mars, a high school/college student who was also a private investigator. And now, producer Joel Silver has come forward to explain why the Veronica Mars movie most likely will never happen. Silver says that he and series creator Rob Thomas talked to the Warner Bros home video people, and that the Veronica Mars DVDs did not sell particularly well. And it’s also worth noting that when it was on the air, Veronica Mars only averaged 2-3 million viewers per episode. Silver says that the video market would have been the reason to make a Veronica Mars movie, and so the audience is perceived as not being there for a theatrical movie either. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas on behalf of the show’s fans, who were capable of creating the impression of a larger fanbase through their avid support of the show. This writer didn’t watch Veronica Mars, but I know some people really enjoyed it, so I’m guessing that some fans will be disappointed to learn that Veronica Mars won’t continue sleuthing on the big screen.#2 THREE MEN, A BRIDE AND A PIZZA PLACETom Selleck confirmed this week that Disney has plans to revive the comedy franchise that started with 1987’s Three Men and a Baby and continued in 1990 with Three Men and a Little Lady. Doing the math, that means that the original baby would this year be turning 23. And that leads directly to the title, which Selleck revealed is tentatively Three Men and a Bride. There’s no word yet as to who exactly wrote the script, but Selleck says that a script does exist, although he hasn’t read it yet. Who would be directing Three Men and a Bride is also unknown. What is known is that Disney has checked the availability of Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg, which suggests a plan to start filming sooner rather than farther down the road. As for what it’s about, well, the title pretty much tells the story, presuming that you know that the “Three Men” who collectively raise the daughter of one of the men (Ted Danson). Three Men and a Baby was also an American remake of a French comedy called Three Men and a Cradle, which itself had a sequel called 18 Years After. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas mostly just because of how long ago it was that moviegoers cared about the Three Men movies. Back then, for example, Steve Guttenberg actually was a major movie star, and Selleck and Danson both had hit TV shows. Will audiences still show up to see what these guys are doing 23 years later?#1 SEX AND THE HIGH SCHOOLSex and the City 2 opened in theaters last weekend, and did particularly less box office than many prognosticators expected. That, however, does not appear to be deterring New Line Cinema and Warner Bros from continuing to explore future possibilities for a third Sex and the City movie. This week, two different stories broke, and they both suggest differing approaches. First, there was this story that was mostly analyzed the reasons Sex and the City 2 didn’t do well as expected. Included in it is word that Warner Bros is waiting to see what sort of “legs” the sequel has before entirely ruling out a third film, which that story seems to suggest would be another movie starring Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon. Or, perhaps, that’s not what they’re intending at all. New Line Cinema has begun talks about adapting Candace Bushnell’s latest book The Carrie Diaries as a movie. The book is a prequel which centers on Carrie Bradshaw’s life as a high school student in Connecticut. Bushnell is also already working on a second book that would be about the young Carrie’s first year living in New York City. When asked in 2008, Candace Bushnell said that she imagined the young Carrie being played by Miley Cyrus. That particular bit of dream casting would probably also require a lot of accent training for the young actress/singer sort of famous for her southern twang. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because the response to Sex and the City 2 is probably a reminder that what might have worked as a HBO series doesn’t necessarily translate into something that can hold up to a series of movies about the same characters.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Bros., Netflix, archives, Pride, Masterpiece, Anna, HBO, sequel, FX, Box","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Guillermo-del-Toro-gives-up-on-The-Hobbit"},{"id":"47509224776419","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Bonds’ License to Kill May Be Revoked","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Bonds' License to Kill May Be RevokedPlus more casting news for X-Men: First Classby Greg Dean Schmitz | July 9, 2010 |  CommentsThis shortened week (following the 4th of July weekend) would normally be a bit light on movie news anyway, but movers and shakers are also holding back their big announcements until San Diego Comic-Con later this month, so this week was even lighter on news. However, a few tidbits still managed to stand out, including plans for movies based upon The Little Mermaid and TV’s The Fall Guy, and new movies for Denzel Washington, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kevin Bacon and Billy Crystal. And hey, if Hollywood’s decisions this week (or lack thereof) get you down, you can always check out the trailer for Indonesia’s hottest new movie, Little Obama, which is exactly what you might think it would be.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYJAMES BOND’S LICENSE TO KILL MAY BE REVOKEDAs movie fans continue to recover from the possibility that MGM’s financial woes may prevent us from ever seeing two awesome The Hobbit movies, there was a lot of news this week about MGM’s other hugely popular franchise: James Bond. It was just a few months ago that we were hoping to soon see the third Daniel Craig-starring Bond movie directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) from a script by Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost/Nixon). And now, not only is that project on hold (as reported a few months ago), “James Bond 23” might be totally scrapped altogether. Now, EON will probably eventually find some way to revive James Bond, but the real immediate issue is that the longer this particular version of James Bond is delayed, the less likely it will be that we ever see it happen. And that includes the very idea of Daniel Craig as our current leaner, meaner Bond for the 21st century. By the time Bond gets revived, we might be hearing stories about younglings like Robert Pattinson being considered for the role (I mostly kid, but a big part of me knows that’s not entirely impossible). If there was good news on the James Bond front this week, it came from Inception/The Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan who said on the red carpet this week that he’d “love to do a Bond film.” That doesn’t mean that he will direct one, but it’s nice to know that one of the directors most in a position to get dream projects made has an interest. Meanwhile, in other MGM franchise news, the company is reportedly considering the possibility of selling off its rights to The Hobbit to New Line Cinema and Warner Bros for the extra cash to help the studio recover as a whole. Of course, in Monopoly terms, that would sort of be like auctioning off Boardwalk so that you can build houses on Baltic.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 LEE MAJORS MIGHT NEED TO REWRITE THE FALL GUY LYRICS FOR MORE CURRENT NAMES THAN CHERYL TIEGS AND BO DEREKThe relatively so-so box office results for TV remakes like MacGruber and The A-Team don’t appear to have intimidated Hollywood producers away from mining 1980s TV show nostalgia for movie ideas. DreamWorks and producer Walter Parkes (Minority Report, Men in Black, Gladiator) are currently working on a movie version of the 1981-1986 ABC action drama The Fall Guy, which starred Lee Majors as a Hollywood stuntman who moonlighted as a bounty hunter. There’s no word yet on any creative types involved with The Fall Guy, including a writer, much less a director or a star. Although I would generally consider the whole TV-show-remake trend a bit on the “Rotten Idea” side, I was also a big fan of The Fall Guy back in the day, and I think that it could potentially be adapted as a pretty cool movie (maybe). One thing that is vastly different in the 2010s than thirty years ago is what exactly being a “stuntman” entails in this age of CGI and motion-capture technology. Today’s stuntmen often have more in common with Andy Serkis and Doug Jones than the rugged archetype that Lee Majors’ Colt Seavers character represented, but there are still some guys out there in the mud swinging around swords and guns, only to then be CGI’ed from a handful of guys into thousands.#2 THERE’S SOMETHING FISHY ABOUT THE NEWEST FAIRY TALE MOVIE: THE LITTLE MERMAIDHans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid is such a classic and well-known fairy tale that it is a little surprising to discover that there has actually never been a live-action, English-language movie version. Obviously, the 1989 Disney animated version is a beloved modern classic (and a big part of Disney’s rejuvenation after the fallow 1970s and 1980s), but 20+ years later, now might be a good time to revisit the legend. And at least, it’s a better idea than say, someone remaking Splash. The director behind this new Little Mermaid is Joe Wright, whose first three films have been 2005’s Pride &amp; Prejudice, the Oscar-winning Atonement and last year’s The Soloist. Wright also has the teenage assassin thriller Hanna, starring Cate Blanchett, Eric Bana and young Saorise Ronan, wrapped up and readying for an April release next year. Working Title Films is producing The Little Mermaid, which was written by Abi Morgan, who has mostly written British TV and the movie Brick Lane, as well as being announced last week as writing the Margaret Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady, starring Meryl Streep. Wright’s vision for a live action The Little Mermaid is also reportedly inspired by a children’s puppet theatre production staged by London’s Little Angel Theatre Company.#3 MAD MAX ACTUALLY RETURNING AND THEN RETURNING AGAINAustralian director George Miller has been trying to get the long-awaited Mad Max reboot going so long that he has apparently decided that when filming finally starts, he will make the most of it and produce two movies. In addition to Mad Max: Fury Road, Miller will reportedly also be making a sequel right away called Mad Max: Furiosa. There’s no word yet about what Furiosa might be about though. Tom Hardy (Shinzon from Star Trek: Nemesis) will be starring as the new Max, and Charlize Theron will also be costarring. For those who don’t know, the Mad Max movies previously starred (a much younger) Mel Gibson as a “Main Force Patrol” police officer in a post-apocalyptic Australia who had to regularly deal with the sort of villainous scum that remained behind after civilization crumbled. George Miller will be filming the two Mad Max movies back-to-back in Australia using 3D cameras (ie, not post-conversion), and hopes to then have them released fairly close to each other in 2012. The start date for this big Mad Max dual production has also been pushed back from this November until February, 2011. Weta Digital has been confirmed as handling the designs, make up FX and costuming.#4 THIS WEEK IN X-MEN: FIRST CLASS ENSEMBLE CASTINGAn interesting theory has surfaced this week in regards to the casting process for 20th Century Fox’s X-Men: First Class, which Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) will start filming in August. Basically, people are now talking about the strong possibility that many of the roles that are being reported as being cast are actually cover roles for the real characters. In other words, if a young actor is supposedly up for an obscure character like Bird Boy (and yes, there really is a Bird Boy in the Marvel Mutant comic books), he might actually be in talks to play Angel. With that as my lead, please consider pretty much everything you’ve heard, or will hear, about X-Men: First Class casting with some caution, because we might be totally “punked.” One rumor this week was that Kick-Ass star Aaron Johnson might be playing Cyclops. That story was quickly debunked, and replaced by the news that Lucas Till (Hannah Montana: The Movie) is in the running to play Cyclops’ brother Havok. Except, if the “fake casting” concept is true, perhaps the role Till is *really* in talks for is Cyclops himself. Who knows?! The same story confirms last week’s story about the casting of Banshee and also breaks the news that Hank “Beast” McCoy (who was recently rumored to be going to another young actor) will instead be played by Nicholas Coult (Clash of the Titans, A Single Man). Finally, the latest breaking news as I write this today is that someone who was actually alive back before the All-New, All-Different X-Men were even thought of might actually be in X-Men: First Class. That star is Kevin Bacon, who at 52, is over 20 years older than the actor who has been as Charles Xavier (31-year-old James McAvoy). Kevin Bacon is reportedly up for the role of the big, bad villain of X-Men: First Class, but we don’t know who that villain might actually be. One wild guess that I will throw out there is the early X-Men villain The Vanisher (whose power was teleportation), mostly because many other early X-Men villains just don’t seem like characters you would cast Kevin Bacon as, but since the Vanisher is an older guy with a penchant for heists and such, Kevin Bacon could be a pretty good choice. The Vanisher is legitimately old-school X-Men, making his debut way back in Uncanny X-Men #2 in November, 1963, making him the team’s second villain ever after Magneto. Or I might be totally off base with this guess. Who might you predict Kevin Bacon could play?#5 DENZEL WASHINGTON SPENDING TIME IN A SAFE HOUSEDenzel Washington is in talks with Universal Pictures to star in the action thriller Safe House. The original script by David Guggenheim (who as yet has no produced scripts to his credit) was the subject of a bidding war between studios in February. Safe House is the story of a young CIA agent who must escort a dangerous prisoner (Washington) to a new safe house after the first one has been destroyed, resulting in all of the other agents being killed. Safe House will mark the Hollywood debut of Swedish director Daniel Espinosa (Babylonsiukan and the upcoming Snabba Cash). Denzel Washington’s next movie will be this November’s Unstoppable, directed by Tony Scott, but the actor otherwise doesn’t have much else work lined up, so it seems likely Safe House will happen sooner rather than later.#6 JOHN LE CARRE’S VERY BRITISH CLASSIC GETS A VERY BRITISH CASTThat headline was written before this writer realized that Michael Fassbender is actually German-Irish, but it still basically gets the point across, even if it’s only 75% correct. Ralph Fiennes, Colin Firth, Gary Oldman and Michael Fassbender have signed on to star in the upcoming adaptation of John Le Carre’s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. The Working Title/Studio Canal coproduction will mark the English-language debut of director Tomas Alfredson, whose vampire drama Let the Right One In still stands as one of the best foreign-language imports of recent years. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the story of George Smiley, a prematurely-retired intelligence expert who is brought back to service to help find a spy who is working within the upper tiers of the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service. Le Carre’s novel, which was previously adapted as a 1979 British TV series starring Sir Alec Guinness, was adapted by screenwriter Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost/Nixon), who has also recently worked on the next James Bond project (see above). Filming of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy will start in London in October.#7 LEONARDO DICAPRIO’S WALL STREET PROJECT MIGHT NOT BE YET ANOTHER COLLABORATION WITH MARTY SCORSESEIn addition to being a Hollywood A list star and actor, Leonardo DiCaprio also has his hand deeply in the producing game via his Appian Way company. One of the projects that he had been hoping to work on with his now frequent directing partner Martin Scorsese was an adaptation of Jordan Belfort’s stockbroker memoir The Wolf of Wall Street. The duo nearly made the movie two years ago but the deal fell apart in a “tug of war” between Warner Bros and Paramount (leading to them making Shutter Island together instead). Now, DiCaprio is talking to Ridley Scott (American Gangster, Black Hawk Down) instead, who would also produce as well as direct, although at issue is whether he could squeeze it in before starting work on the Alien prequel for 20th Century Fox. Ridley Scott reportedly is especially attracted to the script by Terence Winter, who has written and produced several episodes of HBO’s The Sopranos and the upcoming Boardwalk Empire (also a Scorsese project), as well as the movies Brooklyn Rules and Get Rich or Die Tryin’. What’s particularly interesting about Scott possibly directing The Wolf of Wall Street is what it might say about his involvement in the languishing board game adaptation Monopoly. Might whatever economic commentary Scott has to say with Monopoly potentially be addressed instead in a more serious, adult drama like The Wolf of Wall Street?#8 YOU DON’T KNOW BROTHER JACK EITHERColumbia Pictures has attached director Barry Levinson (Bugsy, Rain Man, Wag the Dog) to their planned biopic of human rights activist Jack Healey entitled Brother Jack. Barry Levinson is riding quite a bit of publicity good will following the 15 nominations that his Jack Kevorkian HBO biopic You Don’t Know Jack received this week. Harley Peyton (Less Than Zero, 2001’s Bandits), who also cowrote more than half the episodes of Twin Peaks, wrote the first Brother Jack draft, and it is now being rewritten by Kelly Masterson (Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead). Brother Jack benefits from this being a slow news week (both because of Monday being a holiday and because Comic-Con is coming up), so it gets a Weekly Ketchup slot that probably would normally have gone to some superhero, unneeded remake or a movie involving teen vampires, werewolves or both.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK#1 BILLY CRYSTAL’S LATEST ROLE WILL REQUIRE A LOT LESS OLD GUY MAKEUP THAN HE DID IN THE PRINCESS BRIDEIt feels like a long time ago, but there was once a time when Billy Crystal was a major Hollywood movie star, appearing in movies like When Harry Met Sally… and the two City Slickers movies. Whatever goodwill those movies might have garnered Billy Crystal, he also made movies like Mr. Saturday Night and much of what he did during his run on Saturday Night Live was (in this writer’s opinion) unforgettably corny and hamfisted. Lately, however, most of what Billy Crystal’s been doing is animated voice work in movies like Cars, Monsters, Inc and Howl’s Moving Castle. 20th Century Fox and Walden Media, however, want to see Billy Crystal return to a leading role in a family comedy called Us &amp; Them. Billy Crystal will star in and produce Us &amp; Them, which is a generational comedy (based on an original idea by Crystal) about a grandfather forced to take care of his three grandchildren following the “21st century rules of his daughter, their mother, who has gone on a weeklong work vacation.” Yep, that’s right, Billy Crystal is now stepping into the cranky-but-loveable grampa role previously inhabitated by guys like Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. In addition to likely jokes involving cell phones and video games, Crystal’s character will have to deal with “Little League games where everyone gets a hit, tailored meals and ‘feelings,'” before ultimately using “an old-school-justice style of discipline.” Crystal’s story idea was adapted by married couple Joe Syracuse and Lisa Addario (cowriters of 2007’s Surf’s Up). Us &amp; Them will be directed by Andy Fickman, who has worked with kids before on Race to Witch Mountain and The Game Plan, but this time, he will (probably) have to do so without the help of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Us &amp; Them is this week’s most Rotten Idea mostly because this is sort of a slow news week. In a typical Ketchup, Us &amp; Them might only come in as second or third most rotten.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"cancelled, 4/20, Amazon, spinoff, TV, Pictures, Spectrum, the, impossible","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Bonds-License-to-Kill-May-Be-Revoked"},{"id":"47509226537710","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Will Smith in Bad Boys and MIB Sequels","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Will Smith in Bad Boys and MIB SequelsPlus, casting news for Kristen Stewart and Benicio Del Toro, and Bond 23 is postponed.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 23, 2010 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings us potentially good news for fans of Will Smith, Robert Downey Jr, Cameron Diaz and Kristen Stewart, along with news about James Bond, Friday the 13th, the Arthur and Escape From New York remakes and the I Dream of Jeannie movie.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 THIS WEEK IN WILL SMITH TRILOGY NEWS: BAD BOYS III AND MEN IN BLACK IIIWill Smith has only starred in two sequels, and this week brought fresh news about the continuing plans for third movies in both franchises: Bad Boys III and Men in Black III. First, there was Martin Lawrence, who revealed this week that he’s met with both Smith and director Michael Bay (Transformers, Pearl Harbor) about making a third movie about Miami police detectives Lowrey and Burnett. It’s sort of obvious that if a Bad Boys III movie were to be made, Will Smith would have to be involved, but the news about Michael Bay also returning for a third try is the bigger deal. Bad Boys III is being written for Columbia Pictures by newcomer screenwriter Peter Craig, who wrote and directed a comedy short film called The Climactic Death of Dark Ninja. Will Smith’s other would-be trilogy also got buzz this week with director Barry Sonnenfeld (RV, Wild Wild West) also confirming that he will be returning for his third Men in Black movie, along with a few other details. Sonnenfeld confirmed that not only will Will Smith reprise his role as alien-investigating Agent J, but that Tommy Lee Jones will also return as Agent K. Jones’ involvement had previously seemed questionable, in light of news that Josh Brolin was being considered to play a younger version of Agent K. Finally, Sonnenfeld also mentioned that Men in Black III will be filmed in 3D, continuing the hot new trend. Columbia Pictures is reportedly interested in getting Men in Black III going in time to fill the 2011 Memorial Day weekend spot that opened up when Spider-Man 4 was cancelled in favor of a reboot of the franchise with a new star. All of the films in both Smith franchises, with the exception of the oringinal Men in Black, have been poorly received by critics, which would normally land this news as a “Rotten Idea.” However, both franchises are fan favorites, and it’s always possible that the third time could be a charm. Bad Boys II also benefits from being one of the movies paid loving homage in Hot Fuzz, if that counts for anything.#2 PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE IRON MAN BEHIND THE CURTAINFollowing the success of Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, there are at least five different projects that are eyeing L. Frank Baum’s The Wizard of Oz for a similar revisit. One of them is Oz the Great and Powerful (formerly known as Brick), a Walt Disney prequel that Robert Downey Jr. is reportedly interested in starring in as the Wizard. Disney has a notable director in mind for the project as well: Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition). Mendes’ schedule now appears to be open, considering the news (see down below) that the 23rd James Bond film is indefinitely postponed. Oz the Great and Powerful will be a prequel which tells the story of how the Wizard, a “charlatan who’s part of a traveling circus,” ended up in Oz in the first place. The script was written by Mitchell Kapner, whose most recognizable credit is the 2000 hitman comedy The Whole Nine Yards. The aforementioned other four Oz projects are Universal’s adaptation of the musical Wicked, an animated movie to be directed by John Boorman (Excalibur, Deliverance) and two different projects at Warner Bros (one from the producers of Twilight and the other a dark sequel starring Dorothy’s granddaughter).#3 IS THE MOVIE VERSION OF JOAN JETT WANTED TOO?Kristen Stewart may have a “bad reputation” with many movie fans because of her continuing involvement with The Twilight Saga, but her performance as Joan Jett in The Runaways is being hailed by many critics as surprisingly convincing. So, like her Shark Boy costar, her latest movie news is getting the benefit of the doubt and is avoiding the “Rotten Idea” tag. The word in Hollywood this week (well, mostly the Internet, but same difference, really) is that Kristen Stewart is being considered to replace Angelina Jolie in Wanted 2. The story started the week as a rumor, but it’s now been confirmed that Kristen Stewart has indeed met with director Timur Bekmambetov about possibly playing a “young ass-kicking assassin in the Fraternity” (in other words, not the same Fox character that Jolie played). Whether the movie will happen is still up in the air, however, but if Stewart does sign on, the project has at least a year to come together anyway. Kristen Stewart does, after all, have the two Breaking Dawn movies yet to film, and giving birth to a lycanthrope-loving psychic half vampire baby might require plenty of recuperation time.#4 FORGETTING STRETCH ARMSTRONGThis column has been a bit hard on Taylor Lautner, the star of The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D, whose legions of young female fans (AKA “sharkgirls”) have made him an Internet sensation. One of Lautner’s most rotten of “Rotten Idea” entries was Universal’s Stretch Armstrong, based on the nearly forgotten 1970s-1980s Hasbro action figure toy with elastic arms and legs. However, this week brought news that might just force us to consider what might have been previously unfathomable: Stretch Armstrong could actually be… good? Universal has announced a director and a new screenwriter who suggest something like that could actually happen. Director Rob Letterman (Monsters Vs Aliens, Shark Tale) has signed on, and Nicholas Stoller (Get Him to the Greek; director of Forgetting Sarah Marshall) will be doing a rewrite of the script. This isn’t the first time that Letterman and Stoller have worked together, as Stoller also cowrote Gulliver’s Travels, the 2010 Jack Black fantasy comedy that marks Letterman’s live action debut.#5 DIAZ AND DEL TORO HAVE AN EX TO GRIND20th Century Fox has acquired the rights to the Jane Heller novel An Ex to Grind, with Cameron Diaz and Benicio Del Toro attached to star. The romantic comedy will be about an ex-athlete (Del Toro) who supported his waitress wife’s (Diaz) dreams. When the now successful wife wants to divorce him because he’s become a couch potato in retirement, he files for alimony to maintain the lifestyle he’s been accustomed to, leading her to find a new wife for him. There’s no director attached to the project yet, but this one escapes being a “rotten idea” because of its stars. First, Cameron Diaz has shown that she really can shine in comedies (see: There’s Something About Mary and the Charlie’s Angels movies, of which she was the funniest star, arguably). Even more intriguing is the idea of Benicio Del Toro expanding into the comedy genre. He’s long been attached to play Moe in the Farrelly Brothers’ reboot of The Three Stooges, but with that project apparently delayed for now, An Ex to Grind might just be the movie in which he makes his comedic semi-debut instead. Del Toro has had comedic roles in the past (notably Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas), but this would appear to be his first “mainstream” comedy role since becoming a bigger name star with more dramatic parts.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#5 DAME HELEN MIRREN TO BRING A FEMININE TOUCH TO THE ARTHUR REMAKEHollywood’s fascination with remake fever doesn’t get much more baffling than the remake of Arthur, starring Russell Brand. At issue really is exactly how funny anyone really finds the British comedian, whose first real starring role in a Hollywood movie (Get Him to the Greek) hasn’t come out yet. And yet, Brand still gets starring roles (including the 2011 Easter Bunny movie I Hop). Warner Bros’ Arthur remake is indeed ramping up for production in July in New York, and the first real sign of that came this week. Dame Helen Mirren is in talks to costar as Arthur’s longtime nanny in what is basically a gender switch of the butler character in the original film as played by Sir John Gielgud. Arthur is of course the story of a British alcoholic heir to a massive fortune who falls in love with a working class girl rather than the type of woman that his family approves of. The latest version of the script was rewritten by Peter Baynham, who was one of the cowriters of both Borat and Brüno, which probably gives us an idea of the type of humor Brand’s Arthur is going for. Jason Winer, who is the co-executive producer and director of ABC’s Modern Family will be making his feature film debut directing the Arthur remake for Warner Bros. Although Dame Helen might be able to do something funny playing against her reputation as Arthur’s nanny, this story still gets one of this week’s Rotten Idea slots because Arthur just doesn’t feel like a movie that needs to be remade, and especially not starring Russell Brand. Get Him to the Greek opens just a few weeks before Arthur starts filming, and so it should be interesting to see what becomes of this remake if that movie flops disastrously.#4 TOMORROW NEVER DIES FOR JAMES BONDWith MGM in continuing financial jeopardy and the recent attempt to sell the studio ending fruitlessly, EON Productions has announced that plans for the 23rd James Bond movie have been “indefinitely postponed.” The project has previously been eyed as a possible 2011/2012 release, with Daniel Craig again reprising his version of James Bond, which made Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace blockbuster hits with audiences worldwide. Daniel Craig is still attached to star, but with the plug pulled, it may now be 2013 before another James Bond movie gets made. This also frees director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) to move onto other projects (see the above story about Oz the Great and Powerful). This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because this latest reboot of the Bond franchise has been exactly what the character needed for the 21st century, and it’s our loss that we’re not going to get a third one anytime soon. Another reboot sequel that got bad news this week is Friday the 13th Part 2. The 2009 reboot opened to an astonishing $43 million opening weekend, so it is surprising that producer Brad Fuller says the sequel is now “dead – not happening.” New Line Cinema and Warner Bros had previously been aiming for an August 13, 2010 release for Friday the 13th Part 2. This news isn’t quite as “rotten” as the news of James Bond 23 being postponed, but it’s still surprising and newsworthy.#3 THE UNITED STATES OF DREAMING OF JEANNIEHollywood has had a fascination with adapting old TV shows into movies since the late 1980s, and the results have been mostly negative. Some of the oldest projects in development are based upon 1960s sitcoms, like I Dream of Jeannie, the story of a male astronaut who keeps a sexy magical female slave who calls him “Master” in a bottle in his apartment. Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman starred in the original series, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970. Columbia Pictures has had I Dream of Jeannie in development since the 1990s, and are still moving ahead with it even years after the box office disaster ($63 million domestic after a budget of $85 million) that was their 2005 adaptation of the similiarly themed Bewitched. The latest writer to try modernizing I Dream of Jeannie is Sheila Callaghan, an intellectual New York playwright who wrote two episodes of Showtime’s The United States of Tara. Over the years, the people (formerly) involved with I Dream of Jeannie have included Lindsay Lohan and director Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham). The hiring of a non-comedic screenwriter with some literary cred (Callaghan adapted James Joyce’s Ulysses) is an interesting move, but I Dream of Jeannie is still one of this week’s Rotten Ideas, just based on the fact that the time for that movie, if there ever was one, seems way, way in the past.#2 ROTTEN IDEAS ARE FROM MARSBestselling novels are a natural source for narrative movies. Best selling self help books, however, since they have no actual story or characters, wouldn’t seem to be quite as wise an idea. That’s not stopping Summit Entertainment, as they have acquired the TV and film rights this week to John Gray’s Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus franchise of books. Since the first book’s publication in 1992, relationship counselor John Gray has written over a dozen Mars/Venus books, all of which approach relationships based on the idea that men and women have very different personalities. John Gray has also been a frequent, predictable guest for shows like The Oprah Winfrey Show for nearly twenty years now. Summit hasn’t yet revealed their film plans for Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus yet, but it is expected that it will take the form of “high-concept ensemble comedy along the lines of the hit 2009 release He’s Just Not That Into You. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because it’s yet another example of Hollywood attempting to build an entire movie around a property with a catchy title and a large audience that otherwise doesn’t have anything that would make instant sense as a movie with an actual story. Yes, there are stereotypes about how men and women can be different, but basically, a project like this is not far removed from being the adult equivalent of a movie based on a board game.#1 CRAZIES REMAKE DIRECTOR REMAKING ESCAPE FROM NEW YORKDespite John Carpenter’s Escape From New York remaining one of the director’s best movies, and one that still holds up as a highly recommended futuristic action movie, New Line Cinema is still continuing with their plans for an unnecessary remake. This week, the studio started talks with director Breck Eisner (Sahara, The Crazies) about taking on the project. At one point, Gerard Butler was attached to star as the new Snake Plissken, the bad ass renegade bank robber who is forced to rescue the president when his plane crashes in a future Manhattan that has been turned into a massive penal colony. Butler eventually dropped out of the project (smart, Gerard!), but New Line’s still pursuing the remake, having hired several screenwriters to work on it. Breck Eisner is very into remakes, as, besides The Crazies, he has also worked on a possible remake of The Creature From the Black Lagoon and is currently developing a remake of Flash Gordon. This is the week’s most Rotten Idea because Escape From New York is simply a classic movie that doesn’t need to be remade at all. Snake Plissken is arguably the best example of Kurt Russell at the height of his career, as it was a character he completely made his own. Any actor who attempts to replicate what Kurt Russell did in Escape From New York is on a fool’s errand.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Rocketman, dark, 20th, Competition, drama, know, docudrama, HBO, Ghostbusters, critic, Skip","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Will-Smith-in-Bad-Boys-and-MIB-Sequels"},{"id":"47509226556150","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Ian McShane sails to Stanger Tides","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Ian McShane sails to Stanger Tides\n                        Plus more news about Captain America\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 26, 2010                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                This week’s Ketchup includes casting news for Pirates of the Caribbean 4, news of a Zoolander sequel and a Speedy Gonzalez movie and new projects for Angelina Jolie, Matt Damon, Ryan Reynolds and director Kevin Smith.  And happily, this is a week with zero remakes (well, there is sort of one, but we’ll let Doc Savage slide by) or movies based on kids’ toys or games.  Progress!\n\n\nFRESH DEVELOPMENTS\n\n\n\n#1 BLACKBEARD IN PIRATES 4: NEXT BEST THING TO A SWEARENGEN MOVIE?\nIan McShane, the popular star of Deadwood (as antiquated potty mouth Al Swearengen) is in talks with Disney to costar in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Ian McShane will play the villain of the film, and it’s a famous (and real life) pirate at that: Blackbeard, AKA Edward Teach.  Already cast are Johnny Depp (of course) as Jack Sparrow and Penelope Cruz, who was announced a couple of weeks ago. The franchise is getting a new director for the fourth film in the form of Rob Marshall (Chicago, Nine).  The script, which involves a search for the legendary Fountain of Youth, was written by Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot, who also worked together on the first three films. The title appears to come from the book On Stranger Tides by Tim Powers, which Disney owns the movie rights to.  Powers’ book is also about a pirate named Jack, the search for the Fountain of Youth, and it also features Blackbeard.  Filming of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides starts later this summer in Hawaii, and Disney has scheduled the film for a May 20, 2011 release date.\n\n\n#2 THIS WEEK IN CAPTAIN AMERICA NEWS\nAs reported previously, The First Avenger: Captain America is currently in the screen testing stage, part of the process of finding the young star that will play World War II super soldier Steve Rogers. There are seven guys that are currently being considered, which is a long list, but here you go (alphabetically): Michael Cassidy (Privileged), Chace Crawford (Gossip Girl), Patrick Flueger (Brothers), Garret Hedlund (Eragon), John Krasinski (The Office), Scott Porter (Friday Night Lights) and Mike Vogel (Cloverfield).  Absent from that list are Robert Buckley (Privileged) and Jensen Ackles (Supernatural), both of whom have scheduling conflicts, and that’s why they’re not screen testing. Of those seven, the one that really stands out as a “wtf?” choice is John Krasinski, who does not seem to fit the Steve Rogers “type” at all, except that perhaps he fits in director Joe Johnston’s idea of making Rogers more of a Peter Parker-style “underdog” character.  Of everyone that’s been considered, I think Jensen Ackles seems like the best choice, so his scheduling conflict is unfortunate.  As for these other guys, this writer is not familiar with a lot of these shows or their stars, honestly. Part of the reason you’re not seeing any big names in that list is that the offer for the first film is only $300,000, and it includes an option for up to NINE movies that include The Avengers, sequels, and any other movies that Marvel wants to put Captain America in.  Finally, I should note that there is a rumor swirling around, which Marvel publicists are being quick to quell, that Joe Johnston is being replaced, and The First Avenger: Captain America delayed, because of the poor performance of The Wolfman.  I’ve always thought that Johnston was a weak choice for the movie anyway, as the potential World War II epic seems perfect for a director with a bit more critical heft.  Joe Johnston did direct October Sky, but mostly his movies have been of the blockbuster-wannabe mediocrity stamp.  RT editor-in-chief Matt Atchity and I have bandied about dream directors, and our list includes Steven Soderbergh, David Mamet, Martin Scorsese and Philip Kaufman.  Who’s your dream Captain America director, and from that list, who do you think Marvel should pick?\n\n\n#3 BEN STILLER TO BRING BLUE STEEL BACK TO THE THEATERS WITH ZOOLANDER 2\nZoolander is a very funny comedy that didn’t do as well at theaters as its cultural popularity would suggest.  The simple reason (I believe, anyway) is that it was released two weeks after September 11, and the world wasn’t quite ready yet for that type of movie.  If it had been released at a different time, Zoolander might have been a very big hit.  Ben Stiller apparently still believes in the male fashion model parody that was Derek Zoolander, and so does Paramount Pictures, as they are moving ahead with plans for Zoolander 2.  Justin Theroux, who cowrote Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller (and Etan Cohen), and also wrote this year’s Iron Man 2, is working on the Zoolander 2 script.  Theroux, who made his directing debut with 2007’s Dedication, is also attached to direct (and the guy is also an actor, very busy!).  Everyone involved hopes that Owen Wilson will also return as Zoolander’s rival model, Hanson, but no deal is in place yet.  The villain for the sequel is likely to be played by Jonah Hill, who is in talks for the role. Zoolander 2, however, isn’t the only new project for Stiller this week, as he is attached to star in Brett Ratner’s Tower Heist, which was formerly known as Trump Heist.  Back when the movie was expected to be like a “black Ocean’s 11,” it would have featured stars like Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock and Chris Tucker, but Tower Heist is being rewritten to better suit guys like Ben Stiller.\n\n\n#4 TRAINED MOVIE ASSASSIN ANGELINA JOLIE KILLS CHANCES OF A WANTED 2\nAnyone who’s seen Wanted knows that the idea of a sequel has always seemed sort of odd, as the movie sort of ends perfectly.  The idea of somehow shoehorning Angelina Jolie’s character for continuing assassin highjinx only adds to the incredulity of the proposed sequel. The good news, therefore, is that Angelina Jolie has definitively pulled out of the Wanted sequel, and as a response, Universal Pictures has pulled the plug on the movie.  That brings up the subject of what is next for Jolie, who is currently filming The Tourist with Johnny Depp (as anyone who’s stood in line for groceries recently knows).  It’s looking like her next project may be a Warner Bros space thriller called Gravity, which is about the last survivor of a space mission who is desperately trying to get back to Earth and her daughter.  Like this year’s overlooked (by the Oscars) indie hit Moon and the way it was all about Sam Rockwell, Gravity will be a movie that features almost entirely Angelina Jolie for the entirety of the film.  The director of Gravity is very promising, as it’s Alfonso Cuaron, who has pleased movie fans with Children of Men and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and also delivered a great road movie story with Y Tu Mama Tambien. Cuaron cowrote the Gravity script with his 28-year-old son, Jonas.\n\n\n#5 WAR OF THE GODS RECRUITS\nHollywood is slowly returning to Greek mythology, following Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief and the upcoming release of the remake of Clash of the Titans.  The next big project in that mold is War of the Gods, which will be directed by Tarsem Singh (The Fall, The Cell).  War of the Gods tells the story of Theseus, a Hercules-like hero most famous for his encounter with the Minotaur in the labyrinth, which was just one of his many adventures. Theseus will be played by the already announced Henry Cavill, one of the stars of Showtime’s The Tudors.  Joining Cavill this week is Freida Pinto, the costar of Slumdog Millionaire, who will play Phaedra, an oracle priestess.  Another casting possibility is Mickey Rourke, who would play King Hyperion, but the timing of filming is forcing Rourke to choose between War of the Gods and Conan, in which Rourke would play Corin, the barbarian warrior’s father.  War of the Gods isn’t currently attached to a distributor, but is instead being co-produced by a few different companies.  Filming of War of the Gods is scheduled to start on April 7th, 2010.\n\n\n#6 DOC SAVAGE TO BE A LETHAL WEAPON\nHollywood has been trying to bring the classic pulp hero Doc Savage back to the silver screen since the 1980s, when Arnold Schwarzenegger was being considered for the role. Now, the project seems to actually be going somewhere with the news that Lethal Weapon creator Shane Black will direct Doc Savage, following his first movie as director, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.  Black is being assisted on writing Doc Savage by the writing team of Anthony Bagarozzi and Chuck Mondry, who have no produced films to their credit, but are working on Black’s Cold Warrior, which Mel Gibson is attached to star in.  Doc Savage is a pulp hero who has appeared in novels, radio, comic books and the 1975 movie Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze.  Doc Savage is a classic renaissance man who combines physical brawn with brains, and he is helped by a diverse group of specialists.  The character has been referenced (and mostly spoofed) in things like The Venture Bros and The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension, and the classic cartoon Johnny Quest also has very similar elements to Doc Savage. \n\n\n#7 KEVIN SMITH MAKES STIFLER WANT TO HIT SOMEBODY\nLike most famous directors, Kevin Smith always has a few different movies that might be his next movie (which in his case include Ranger Danger and the Danger Rangers, the horror movie Red State and a possible Clerks 3).  This week, Smith added another project to his slateby announcing that he wants to make a hockey movie called Hit Somebody, starring his Cop Out star Seann William Scott.  Smith, displaying loyalty to his favorite sport, chose to announce this movie not via the trades, but through NHL.com. Scott has starred in many comedies in the last ten years, but he remains most closely associated with Stifler from the American Pie movies.  Kevin Smith sees Hit Somebody as Scott’s chance to graduate to a higher level as a star, comparing him to Tom Hanks, who also started off with comedies. Calling Hit Somebody “big, epic in scale,” Kevin Smith also clearly sees this hockey story, which will span 30 years, as something that will potentially stand out from his usual fare as well.\n\n\n#8 MATT DAMON TO YET AGAIN PLAY SOME DUDE FROM MASSACHUSETTS\nMatt Damon has signed with New Regency (which mostly distributes through 20th Century Fox) to star as Robert F. Kennedy in a planned biopic about the slain politician.  Damon’s deal depends, however, on his approval of the script, which will determine whether the movie ever actually gets made.  The screenwriter that has to pass Damon’s muster is Steven Knight, whose three produced movies to date are Eastern Promises, Amazing Grace and Dirty Pretty Things.  Knight is working from the RFK biography His Life by Evan Thomas.  Steven Knight is also working on adapting Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol, the third to feature the Robert Langdon character from The Da Vinci Code. As for RFK himself, for those who aren’t familiar with him, he was of course the younger brother of President John F. Kennedy, served controversially as JFK’s attorney general, was elected as a New York Senator in 1964, and ran for president himself in 1968.  The day of Kennedy’s assassination was adapted to film by Emilio Estevez in 2006 as Bobby, but Kennedy himself was not one of the central characters of the ensemble drama.\n\n\n#9 THE BROKEN LIZARD GUYS RETURN WITH ROGUE SCHOLARS\nThe Broken Lizard comedy troupe has signed with Universal Pictures to produce two movies, the first of which is called Rogue Scholars. None of the Broken Lizard guys (Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Hefferman, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter and Erik Stolhankse) are stars in their own right, but their five films to date include Beerfest and Super Troopers, which was also a Sundance hit, and has become something of a fan sensation. Their latest movie, The Slammin’ Salmon, was ill-received by critics (33% RT score), and did very little at the box office in December.  Universal still has faith in the guys, however, and has signed the troupe for both Rogue Scholars and an untitled movie that no details have been revealed for yet.  Rogue Scholars will revolve around five unruly professors, but part of Universal’s scheme to bring Broken Lizard to a wider audience lies in the rest of the cast.  A younger generation of comedians will be cast as the students, and older comedians will be cast as the administration. So, that three different age ranges will be represented in this very generational comedy.  \n\n\n#10 GHOST RIDER AND DEADPOOL TO GET ANIMATED\nDreamWorks Animation has announced their 3D CGI animated release for March 30, 2012, and it’s called The Croods.  Nicolas Cage and Ryan Reynolds will provide the lead voice roles in the comedy set in prehistoric caveman times.  Cage will play Grug, the leader of a caveman family, and Reynolds will play an “outsider whose new ideas challenge the patriarch’s authority.”  The story also revolves around a violent earthquake that forces Grug and his family to search for a new home, and Grug also has a daughter who falls for Reynolds’ character.  The Croods was written by Chris Sanders (cowriter of Mulan, How to Train Your Dragon) and Kirk DeMicco (cowriter of Space Chimps), based upon a screenplay originally written by DeMicco and John Cleese (of Monty Python fame).  Chris Sanders is also directing The Croods, which marks his first solo project, after codirecting Lilo &amp; Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon.  In other animated CGI news, CHUD is reporting on an unconfirmed rumor that Pixar may have scrapped plans for Newt, their amphibian adventure, leaving its 2012 slot open for Monsters, Inc. 2 instead.\n\n\nROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK\n\n\n\n#1 THE FASTEST MOUSE IN ALL OF MEXICO GETS HIS OWN MOVIE\nNew Line Cinema has announced plans to bring the classic Looney Tunes character Speedy Gonzalez to the big screen.  Voicing the energetic Mexican speedster mouse will be comedian/actor George Lopez (one guess as to what his sitcom was called).  Speedy Gonzalez is being written by Alec Cohen and Alec Sokolow, who are best known as the writing team behind the two Garfield movies. Here’s how producer Ann Lopez describes the movie version of Speedy Gonzalez, “Speedy’s going to be a misunderstood boy who comes from a family that works in a very meticulous setting, and he’s a little too fast for what they do. He makes a mess of that. So he has to go out in the world to find what he’s good at.” There’s no denying that there was a lot about the original cartoons that was borderline racist.  However, Speedy Gonzalez was still one of my favorite Looney Tunes, as those cartoons were just so energetic, with a suitably fast pace and a lot of fun.  So, I really want to be optimistic about a Speedy Gonzalez movie.  However, the involvement of the Garfield guys, and the general tone of recent CGI cartoon adaptations like Alvin and the Chipmunks makes me have to predict that this movie is probably going to disappoint a lot of Speedy’s older fans.  And that’s why it’s this week’s Rotten Idea.\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.\n                                            \n                \n            ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"live, sports, Mindy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Ian-McShane-sails-to-Stanger-Tides"},{"id":"47509226566394","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Sam Worthington takes on Dracula, George Lucas takes on fairies","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Sam Worthington takes on Dracula, George Lucas takes on fairiesPlus \"Weird Al\" Yankovic talks about his next movieby Greg Dean Schmitz | January 29, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup features stories about new roles for Sam Worthington, Robert De Niro, Mel Gibson, Zac Efron and Miley Cyrus, as well as new movies for the director of X-Men Origins: Wolverine and musician-turned-director… “Weird Al” Yankovic!FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 SAM WORTHINGTON: TERMINATOR, JAKE SULLY, PERSEUS AND NOW… DRACULA?With Avatar now the top grossing worldwide release of all time, Sam Worthington is in talks with Universal Pictures to continue his impressive big-budget career with Dracula Year Zero, to be directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow). Unlike the Vlad movie that Brad Pitt is producing, Dracula Year Zero is more of a fantasy story that mixes elements of the real Vlad the Impaler with Bram Stoker’s Dracula character. That means you can probably expect many of the obligatory vampire aspects that we associate with Dracula, like turning into a bat or mist, though all that Proyas would confirm in 2008 was that the movie would feature “stakes and teeth… (and) …lots and lots of blood!” Dracula is, of course, one of Universal’s classic monsters, and this will be the first Universal movie to feature Dracula since 2004’s disastrous flop Van Helsing. Dracula Year Zero was written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who are also working together on the Flash Gordon reboot. Sam Worthington will also next be seen in the Clash of the Titans remake, John Madden’s The Debt and Last Night, with Keira Knightley. In other Sam Worthington news, SlashFilm is reporting on a rumor that James Cameron is already signing up technical crew members for 3- to 5-year contracts to start work on (the previously reported) Avatar sequel.#2 GEORGE LUCAS TO REVEAL FAIRIES GET THEIR MAGIC FROM MIDICHLORIANS?George Lucas is venturing forth into the world of musicals with an untitled CGI animation film that is currently in preproduction at Skywalker Ranch. The only details that are currently known is that the musical involves fairies, and the music will come from a variety of sources. Kevin Munroe (TMNT and the upcoming Dead of Night) is directing from a script by David Berenbaum (Elf, The Haunted Mansion), and George Lucas is of course producing, and may have also come up with the movie’s original story idea. This CGI musical joins Lucas’ other current project that he is producing (but not directing), which is Red Tails, the story of the Tuskegee Airmen, starring Terrence Howard, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Method Man.#3 THIS WEEK IN 3D: GREMLINS 3, GHOSTBUSTERS 3, HARRY POTTER 7 &amp; 8,CLASH OF THE TITANSAlthough Avatar may have been a huge success even without it, much credit is being given to 3D for its box office records, and Hollywood is going crazy with ideas on how to make their next big movies jump on the 3D bandwagon. First up, there is the unconfirmed rumor via MarketSaw that the long-in-development Gremlins 3 project might be getting new life as a stereoscopic 3D project, as might Ghostbusters 3. In the more confirmed realm, there’s also Warner Bros, which has moved the release date of Clash of the Titans back a week to April 2 to facilitate an adaptation to 3D. The studio is also now planning on releasing the two parts of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in 3D when the movies are released on November 19, 2010 and July 15, 2011.#4 MEL GIBSON: FROM ROAD WARRIOR TO COLD WARRIORWith his latest film as an actor, Edge of Darkness, opening in theaters today, Mel Gibson was revealed this week to be in talks with Universal Pictures to reunite with Lethal Weapon screenwriter Shane Black on a project that Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) is directing. In Cold Warrior, Gibson would play an old-school spy who has to come out of retirement to deal with a domestic terrorism threat originating from Russia, and he has to team up with a young agent in the process. Shane Black didn’t write Cold Warrior, however, which comes from a new screenwriter named Charles Mondry. There’s no word yet on when Cold Warrior will film, but it is likely to be after this summer’s filming of How I Spent My Summer Vacation, and Gibson also has plans to direct Leonardo DiCaprio in an untitled Viking project. Before any of that, in addition to Edge of Darkness, Gibson has also already wrapped filming of The Beaver, the Jodie Foster-directed comedy about a guy whose best friend is a beaver puppet on his hand.#5 WEIRD AL’S NEXT MOVIE IS PROBABLY NOT GANDHI 2This week comedic musician and sometime actor “Weird Al” Yankovic revealed that he has signed a deal with Cartoon Network in which he agreed to provide all sorts of possible content for them, including TV series, animation and a live-action feature film, which is the first thing he’s doing. Yankovic hasn’t really revealed too many details about the movie, except that it is not a sequel to UHF, it’s a comedy and the star will be a teenager. Weird Al will make an appearance in the movie, and a big part of this story is that it’s the first time he’s going to direct a feature film (he’s directed lots of TV stuff already).#6 ROBERT DE NIRO TO REGAIN HIS CAPE FEAR ACCENT AS GEORGE WALLACE IN SELMA?In a story about Robert De Niro switching agencies, Deadline Hollywood also broke the news about two new projects (in addition to a few others that had previously been announced). The first bit of news concerns Selma, the new project from Precious director Lee Daniels about desegregation, with De Niro reportedly in line to play infamous Alabama Governor George Wallace. The other new role that is a bit unexpected is a sequel to Midnight Run, the very funny 1988 fugitive comedy with Charles Grodin, in which De Niro played a bounty hunter escorting an accountant who’s embezzled money from a Las Vegas gangster. Among De Niro’s other upcoming roles are Little Fockers (the third in the Meet the Parents series), Stone (with Edward Norton) and Robert Rodriguez’s Machete (all of which are wrapped) and a role in the awesomely-titled Another Night in Suck City.#7 ZAC EFRON PICKS UP NEW SPY AND TIME TRAVEL MOVIESZac Efron is looking to make the transition from being a teen TV sensation to being an actual grown up movie star with the news this week of two new projects. First up, at Universal there is Fire, an adaptation of a graphic novel by Brian Michael Bendis (Ultimate Spider-Man) about a college student who is recruited by the CIA, only to discover that he is being trained for a program that creates expendable field agents. Bendis is adapting his own comic. Meanwhile, at Warner Bros, Efron has signed on for an untitled time travel movie that is in the vein of Back to the Future, and which blends together a project called Algorithm with an untitled pitch.#8 OMG! MILEY AND DEMI LOLMiley Cyrus and Demi Moore are in talks to star as a daughter-mother pair in the English language remake of the 2008 hit French comedy LOL: Laughing Out Loud. Cyrus will play a 15-year-old who is dumped by her boyfriend, so she pursues his best friend, while her recently divorced mother struggles to “maintain a civil relationship with her daughter.” Lisa Azuelos, who wrote and directed the original French movie (starring Sophie Marceau) will also write and direct this English-language remake.#9 WOLVERINE DIRECTOR HEADING BACK NORTHGavin Hood, the director of Rendition and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, is in talks with Walden Media (Tooth Fairy, The Chronicles of Narnia) to direct an untitled adaptation of the non-fiction book The Cruelest Miles: The Heroic Story of Dogs and Men in a Race Against an Epidemic. The book tells the true story of the 1925 journey that is now commemorated each year by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. In 1925, 20 men and 200 dogs rushed across a 674 mile distance of wilderness to deliver an emergency shipment of diptheria antidote to Nome, Alaska, braving temperatures of minus 60 degrees. The book was adapted by Sean O’Keefe and Will Staples, who haven’t yet had a feature film produced, but did cowrite together the video games Lair and Pursuit Force. The project, which was formerly known as Ice Bound (when it was in development at the now defunct Miramax Films), is tentatively scheduled to start filming this summer.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK#1 EAT, SLEEP, POOP, DREAM, WORKJust two weeks after Lionsgate put an adaptation of the pregnancy self help book What to Expect When You’re Expecting into development, DreamWorks has also stepped in with a similar project. They’ve picked up the rights to Eat, Sleep, Poop: A Common Sense Guide to Your Baby’s First Year by Beverly Hills pediatrician Scott W. Cohen, which will be first published on March 30, 2010. Eat, Sleep, Poop is being adapted as a comedy by screenwriters Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson (cowriters of Four Christmases). This story gets the Rotten Idea tag for the same reason that What to Expect When You’re Expecting did, which is that non-fiction self help books don’t seem like the best source for movie material, since there is no inherent story in them other than a loose concept and a catchy title.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"YouTube, CNN, mockumentary, critic, Musicals, Rocketman, name, of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Sam-Worthington-takes-on-Dracula-George-Lucas-takes-on-fairies"},{"id":"47509228181249","title":"Weekly Ketchup: James Cameron Plans a Fantastic Voyage","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: James Cameron Plans a Fantastic VoyagePlus disturbing rumors about Spider-Man 4by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 11, 2009 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes a remake of Fantastic Planet, a crazy Spider-Man 4 rumor, new roles for Natalie Portman, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston and yet more movies riding the coattails of The Twilight Saga.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 JAMES CAMERON PRODUCING MUCH SMALLER MOVIE THAN AVATAR: A REMAKE OF FANTASTIC VOYAGEAlthough he hasn’t picked his next movie as director (it may be either Battle Angel or an Avatar sequel), James Cameron did announce this week that he will be producing a remake of the 1966 science fiction adventure Fantastic Voyage. He’ll be producing for 20th Century Fox, who has had this planned for a long time. Fantastic Voyage told the story of a team of scientists who are shrunk down to microscopic size and sent into a tiny submarine into the body of a dying scientist. The movie was also adapted as a novel by Isaac Asimov (making many people, including myself, think that it was actually an Asimov story first). Although Cameron won’t be directing Fantastic Voyage himself, he’s on board as a producer so that Fox can take advantage of Lightstorm Entertainment’s new technology (created for Avatar) to create the “world” of the inside of a guy’s body. The Fantastic Voyage remake was written by Shane Salerno (Aliens vs Predator: Requiem; cowriter of Armageddon).#2 JOSH BROLIN PUTTING ON TOMMY LEE JONES’ SUIT IN MEN IN BLACK 3?The Los Angeles Times is reporting that Josh Brolin is being considered for a role in Men in Black 3. He’d be playing the young version of Tommy Lee Jones’ Agent J when Will Smith’s Agent K character travels back in time. It’s not yet known if Tommy Lee Jones will be returning, or if Brolin will completely be his replacement as the character. Sony hopes to get Men in Black 3 in production in 2010, filming at least partly in New York, with Barry Sonnenfeld (the director of the first two movies) in talks to direct from a script by Etan Cohen (cowriter of Tropic Thunder, Idiocracy).#3 PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES AND NATALIENatalie Portman has signed on to star as Elizabeth Bennet in Lionsgate’s adaptation of the popular mash-up novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies by Seth Grahame-Smith (and Jane Austen, sort of). The concept of the book is that Grahame-Smith took Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice and then added his own material to the book, so that Austen’s mannerly romantic novel because a book about zombie hunting (and still some romance as well). The same publisher (Quirk Books) recently followed it up with Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters. Although this new sub-genre runs the risk of inspiring tons of really awful imitators, for now, I’m staying hopeful. Natalie Portman will also be producing the project, which doesn’t yet have a screenwriter or director.#4 YOU’VE JUST KILLED A BUNCH OF VILLAINS, DEADPOOL. WHAT’S NEXT? I’M GOING TO ZOMBIELAND!Although this hasn’t been published in the trades yet, this story from CHUD sounds legitimate, and so I’m running with it. The site is reporting that the writers that 20th Century Fox has found for their highly-anticipated (by comics fans, at least) Deadpool movie are none other than Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, AKA the guys behind this year’s comedy hit Zombieland. Although I didn’t think Zombieland was a perfect movie, it was certainly a lot of fun, and it’s quite easy to see the connection in tongue-in-cheek tone between Zombieland and Deadpool. For those unfamiliar with the character, the “Merc with a Mouth” specializes in over-the-top assassinations of minor Marvel Comics characters, accentuated by frequent comments “through the fourth wall,” directly to the reader. In movie form, this has the potential of feeling like a superhero version of Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, and so Deadpool has the potential to be quite awesome. If CHUD’s story pans out, it sounds like 20th Century Fox may have found the right guys for the job.#5 ADAM SANDLER AND JENNIFER ANISTON PLAYING PRETENDColumbia Pictures is in talks with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston to star in Pretend Wife, a romantic comedy previously known as Holiday in Hawaii. The premise of the story is unknown, but it appears to possibly involve a honeymoon in Hawaii for a couple that’s only pretending to be married (just guessing, based on the two titles). The top contender to direct is Dennis Dugan, who has worked with Sandler several times before (Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, You Don’t Mess with the Zohan). Sandler’s Happy Madison is also producing, and the script is by Allan Loeb (cowriter of 21) and Tim Dowling (cowriter of Role Models). Columbia is hoping to start filming in early 2010 and is eyeing a pre-Valentine’s Day release date of February 11, 2011.#6 DIRECTOR SAM MENDES GOES BUFFALO HUNTING AT BUTCHER’S CROSSINGWhile The Road is depressing audiences across the country, the film’s writer, Joe Penhall, is taking advantage of the its current buzz to find his next project. Next up for Penhall is Butcher’s Crossing, a Western with a premise that sounds a bit like Heaven’s Gate (which was Michael Cimino’s legendary bomb blamed for ending the 1970s run of Hollywood by auteur directors). The similarity is that Butcher’s Crossing is about a young man who drops out of Harvard to pursue his dream of heading West, which takes him to a small Kansas town where he joins the search for a large buffalo herd. Butcher’s Crossing, which is based upon a 1960 novel by John Williams (not the composer) is being developed by Focus Features, who are hoping that Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) will direct.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#4 TWILIGHT STUDIO TAKES ON THE ORIGINAL YOUNG VAMPIRESummit Entertainment is continuing to look for ways to stretch out the audience for its Twilight Saga franchise, and now that includes going all the way back to the guy that started it all. Along with Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment, Summit is developing Vlad, a script by actor Charlie Hunnam (Nicholas Nickleby) about Vlad the Impaler, the Transylvanian prince that inspired the story of Count Dracula, focusing on his ascent to his land’s throne as a young man. Although there’s little evidence that Vlad the Impaler was actually a vampire, he did build a nasty reputation as someone who came up with particularly gruesome ways of torturing and executing people. Anthony Mandler, a music video director, is in talks to direct. Interest in Mandler is based on Summit’s executives being impressed with a reel of his past work (which includes 10 Rhianna videos). This story is a Rotten Idea because although it might be cool to see Hollywood tackling Vlad the Impaler, the obvious connection to The Twilight Saga suggests that this is likely to be the sort of teen-girl-friendly glossing over of his legend that isn’t exactly what most of us were expecting from a Vlad movie.#3 THE MASTER OF THE TEEN DANCE MOVIE IS SKIPPING ROPEDuane Adler, the screenwriter for Step Up and Save the Last Dance, is now working on Jump Around, a teen dance drama that will address the exciting world of competitive high school jump roping. Yes, as in the childhood pasttime of skipping rope. And this time around, Adler will also be directing. Seriously, Hollywood, you make my job of coming up with fake stories for April Fools’ Day harder every year! The script is about a group of teenagers who form a “Double-Dutch jump roping team,” at their high school to compete in an international competition. There’s no word yet on when the independent production will start filming.#2 DISNEY BETTING ON FALLEN ANGELSJust as the young adult book market has been following the Twilight model for a few years, Hollywood is now also trying to copy that franchise’s success by optioning as many of those subsequent series as possible. The latest example is Disney, which has optioned rights to Fallen, a book by Lauren Kate that was published this week and is part of a planned four-book series. Fallen tells the story of a teenage girl who finds herself torn between “two charismatic young men, unaware that they are fallen angels who have battled over her for centuries.” In other words, instead of immortal vampires and werewolves, this girl’s love interests just hew closer to a more family-friendly Christian/Biblical mythology. Now that angels are taken, I can’t wait to see what mythological characters get pegged into the format next. I’m still betting on Smurfs.#1 WILL SPIDER-MAN 4 TOTALLY CHANGE ONE OF PETE’S CLASSIC LOVE INTERESTS?Okay, right up front, this writer wants to let you know that he thinks this story is total bunk. However, it involves Spider-Man 4, and so I can’t really ignore it either. Movieline is reporting that John Malkovich is in talks to costar in Spider-Man 4 as the Vulture, one of Spidey’s original villains (debuting all the way back in The Amazing Spider-Man #2 in 1963). Okay, that right there is not the ridiculous part, and Malkovich could indeed be a pretty great choice to play the Vulture. No, the really strange part of the story is that the magazine is reporting that the character of Felicia Hardy, who Anne Hathaway is the top choice to play, won’t be the Black Cat as she’s always been in the comics. Nope, they’re saying that instead she will be a completely new character, made up just for the movies, called the Vulturess, who is obviously some sort of sidekick for the Vulture. The article caps it by saying that the Lizard won’t be in the movie at all, because the “suits” don’t want an odd-looking enemy, preferring villains whose faces you can see (the Vulture doesn’t wear a mask). Okay, I know Sam Raimi didn’t do a great job with Spider-Man 3, but I really can’t see this being the route he’d go with Spider-Man 4. Why completely change Felicia Hardy into being a different villain rather than just introduce a new character for the role? And why create a goofy-sounding character like the Vulturess at all? I think someone seriously yanked Movieline’s chain on this one, but I’d also be remiss if I didn’t report on it, even if I think it’s totally fake. And if it’s not fake, expect Spider-Man 4 to quickly become the most fan-mocked superhero movie since Catwoman.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Channel, Bowl, batman, casting, Exclusive, Schedule, cooking, of, medical","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-James-Cameron-Plans-a-Fantastic-Voyage"},{"id":"47509228201738","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Threequels for Kill Bill, Transformers","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Threequels for Kill Bill, TransformersPlus, Fox teams with EA to evolve Spore into a filmby Greg Dean Schmitz | October 2, 2009 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes new movies for Leonardo DiCaprio and Hugh Jackman, sequel news for Kill Bill and Transformers, two CGI animated movies about the weird twists and turns of evolution and a surprising amount of news of English language remakes of foreign movies most of us didn’t see (and one that a lot of us did, and loved).FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 QUENTIN TARANTINO CONFIRMS HIS PLANS TO KILL BILL ONE MORE TIME… IN 2014Entertainment Weekly reports that while talking to an Italian television show, director Quentin Tarantino confirmed that he plans to revist Uma Thurman’s character in Kill Bill 3. Tarantino wants to have a ten year gap between the release of Kill Bill 2 and Kill Bill 3 (some sites are mentioning a rumored title of Kill the Bride), and that would put the release some time in 2014. That would still give QT time to make another movie before then. In 2014, Uma Thurman will have aged to 44, and her daughter from the first two movies will have aged as well. There are several rumors about what exactly the third movie’s plot could be about, most of which involve characters from the first two movies getting revenge against The Bride for the violence she inflicted on their lives.#2 THE MILLIONS OF WORLDS OF SPORE CRAFT20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios are teaming up with Electronic Arts to adapt their hit 2008 PC game Spore. The film would be a CGI animated “creature feature” directed by Chris Wedge (Ice Age, Robots). This news comes just a week after Wedge was also announced as director of another new movie for Fox and Blue Sky, and adaptation of the children’s book Leaf Men. In Spore, players create and evolve life, beginning at a a microscopic level and eventually evolving into the dominant race of a planet, and ultimately exploring space and interacting with races created by other players. The game designer of Spore was Will Wright, famous for his work in creating previous “world building” games under the Sim brand, including SimCity, SimEarth and of course, The Sims. EA already has some 100 million unique creatures created by players registered in their database. In addition to the original PC game, Electronic Arts has also extended the growing franchise to other platforms. The job of adapting Spore, which does not have anything resembling a single storyline is going to screenwriters Greg Erb (cowriter of Senseless, RocketMan) and Jason Oremland, who are also two of the writers of this December’s Disney release The Princess and the Frog.#3 LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO PLAY TRAVIS MCGEE IN THE DEEP BLUE GOODBYE20th Century Fox is developing an adaptation of the 1964 mystery novel The Deep Blue Goodbye by John D. MacDonald, with Leonardo DiCaprio attached to star. DiCaprio would play Travis McGee, a character that went on to appear in 21 novels, each with a title featuring a color. McGee is “a self-described beach bum who lives aboard the 52-foot houseboat The Busted Flush, and alleviates his cash flow problems by hiring on as a salvage consultant… recover(ing) property for clients, taking a hefty percentage and getting into a lot of danger and romance in sun-drenched Florida.” The script was adapted by Dana Stevens (City of Angels, For the Love of the Game), and is currently out for consideration by several directors. DiCaprio will also be producing via his Appian Way company, and if The Deep Blue Goodbye is a hit, with 20 other books in the series, the star could find a reliable source of movies for the foreseeable future.#4 WARNER BROS THINKS THE FUTURE IS WILDWarner Bros has struck a deal with Vanguard Animation (Space Chimps, Happily N’Ever After) to produce a movie version of the Animal Planet documentary-style animated series, The Future Is Wild. The series speculates on how life might evolve on Earth over the next 200 million years. As climate changes and the continents move, many of today’s dominant animals, such as mammals, birds and reptiles eventually go extinct, leading to a future where descendants of squids and octopi come to land to become the new dominant races, along with evolved worms and insects. This deal is especially timely considering that the concept bears a resemblance to the mix of animation and evolution in the plans for a movie based upon Spore, also announced this week. The timing also fits in with the news that a second season of The Future Is Wild will be announced next week. The exact details of how The Future Is Wild will be adapted are not yet known, but the phrasing of the announcement seems to suggest that the movie will keep the series’ documentary-like style, rather than say, a dramatic interpretation of the material. The often bizarre evolutionary concepts in The Future Is Wild bear a close resemblance to the works of author Dougal Dixon, who also wrote the companion book, and whose own book, After Man: A Zoology of the Future, was at time being developed as a feature film of its own (but those plans have long since been scrapped).#5 THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE AND FRIENDS CHUGGING BACK TO THE BIG SCREENAlthough his 2000 film debut, Thomas and the Magic Railroad, was not a commercial success, the popular children’s book and televison character Thomas the Tank Engine is once again being developed as a feature film project. Thomas the Tank Engine is, of course, an anthromorphic steam locomotive train who has several friends who are also trains, and together they have adventures on the rails. Josh Klausner (next April’s Date Night, one twelve credit screenwriters for Shrek the Third) has been hired to start work on adapting Thomas &amp; Friends for the big screen. 2010 marks the 65th anniversary of Thomas the Tank Engine, and that year will also see the launch of a new CGI animated TV series that will provide voices for several characters that were previously mute. That series will then lead to the release of this feature film, scheduled for the spring of 2011. Alec Baldwin, who narrated many episodes of the original series, and appeared in the 2000 film, will not be involved with this version.#6 SAM RAIMI MAKING SPOOKY PICTURES FOR THE KIDSJust a few weeks after Guillermo del Toro announced plans for his Double Dare You partnership with Disney, Sam Raimi is also getting into the game of producing scary movies aimed at family audiences. Raimi’s Spooky Pictures is a subsidiary of his Ghost House horror label, and has a deal with Columbia Pictures. Spooky Pictures will get started with The Substitute, an English language remake of a 2007 Danish thriller about a sixth grade class who try to warn their parents that their new substitute teacher is actually an evil alien. Director Scott Derrickson (The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) has started work on adapting the screenplay along with Paul Harris Boardman, who previously cowrote The Exorcism of Emily Rose and Urban Legends: Final Cut with Derrickson.#7 500 DAYS OF SUMMER DIRECTOR AND COSTAR BOTH MOVING ON TO ADAPTING FOREIGN MOVIESOne of this year’s biggest arthouse hits was the romantic dramedy 500 Days of Summer, and now both the movie’s director and one of its costars are moving on to projects in which they will be tackling English language remakes of recent European movies. Director Mark Webb (who is also developing a Jesus Christ Superstar movie) is in negotiations to produce and direct Just Another Love Story, a remake of a 2008 Danish thriller about a crime photographer who pretends to be the boyfriend of a woman suffering amnesia, which goes terribly wrong when the real boyfriend shows up, and he’s distinctly not pleased. And then there’s young 12-year-old Chloe Moretz, who in addition to playing the sister in 500 Days of Summer, also stars in next year’s dark superhero movie Kick-Ass. Moretz has this week landed the lead role in Let Me In, the English language remake of last year’s arthouse hit Let the Right One In, which starts filming later this fall in New Mexico. Chloe Moretz will be joined by Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road), who will play the lead boy, and Richard Jenkins (The Visitor, HBO’s Six Feet Under), who will play her character’s adult guardian (sort of).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#1 MICHAEL BAY ANNOUNCES TRANSFORMERS 3 FOR THE SUMMER OF 2011Director Michael Bay announced on his website this week that development of Transformers 3 formally started this week, with the Paramount targeting a release date of July 1, 2011. Both Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox (in spite of her recent complaints around Revenge of the Fallen) are both expected to return. Screenwriter Ehren Kruger (The Ring; cowriter of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) and Michael Bay met with Hasbro this week to discuss which new Transformers the toy company would like to see introduced in the next movie. That is, after all, what is most important to telling a Transformers movie’s story: what toys can the movie sell? Michael Bay also promised that his “little movie,” Pain and Gain, about two Florida body builders who get involved with extortion and kidnapping, will be his next project after Transformers 3. This news is therefore bad news for anyone who was awaiting Bad Boys 3 or Bay’s X-Men-like teen literature adapation I Am Number Four. If you figure a possible 2012 release for Pain and Gain, that means that any other Michael Bay movie is unlikely to happen before 2013, and that’s presuming that Bay doesn’t in the meantime sign on for Transformers 4. All of this news gets the “Rotten Idea” tag because Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was pretty awful, regardless of how much money it made. But, the rosy side of the news for those who dread any news of a Michael Bay movie is that this means a few more years of Bay not being able to direct any other movie, such as whatever favorite potentially big budget genre movie you as a fan might in particular cherish.#2 LAUREN CONRAD’S BOOK ABOUT A REALITY TV STAR TO BECOME AN ACTUAL MOVIE?Temple Hill Entertainment, the production company of one of the producers of Twilight has secured the movie rights to L.A. Candy, the recent bestselling novel by Lauren Conrad, the star of MTV’s “reality” shows The Hills and Laguna Beach. In L.A. Candy, a 19 year old girl moves to Hollywood where she finds fame as a “reality” series star, forcing her to deal with being a big star. Conrad has plans to follow L.A. Candy with two more novels. The project is currently looking for a screenwriter to adapt the book. This one is a Rotten Idea for what I think are pretty obvious reasons. MTV’s “reality” shows obviously have good ratings, so someone is watching them, but the idea of a movie based upon what is basically a fictionalization of the experience of one of the stars of one of these shows is basically opening the Pandora’s Box on all sorts of potential cross pollination between reality shows and movies. Will people pay $10 to see what is basically a dramatized two hour episode of a reality show that they can already watch on TV for free? And even if they actually would, should they?#3 HUGH JACKMAN TO ROCK ‘EM SOCK ‘EM ROBOTS IN REAL STEELHugh Jackman is in talks with DreamWorks to star in Real Steel, a futuristic sports movie set in a time when robots have replaced human fighters in the ring. Jackman would be playing a human ex-boxer who becomes a Robot Boxing promoter who finds a discarded robot that always seems to win. Jackman’s character also discovers he has a 13-year-old son that he bonds with as the scrappy robot fights his way to the top. Real Steel is based upon a short story by Richard Matheson (I Am Legend, What Dreams May Come) that was also the inspiration for an episode from the 5th season of The Twilight Zone, starring Lee Marvin as the ex-boxer. Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum, Cheaper by the Dozen) will be directing Real Steel from a script he is working on with screenwriter John Gatins (Hardball; cowriter of Coach Carter). DreamWorks hopes to start filming in May, 2010. Real Steel is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because the box office seems to be mostly saying that audiences do not have an instant love with big screen robots, and the saccharine sweetness of this sports story just seems to put it over the top as a likely schmaltzy movie that might feel like Bicentennial Man crossed with Rocky V.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"SXSW, CMT, dramedy, FX, Kimmy, Vudu, live, Fresh","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Threequels-for-Kill-Bill-Transformers"},{"id":"47509228187396","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Idris Elba cast in Thor, more Spider-Man 4 rumors","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Idris Elba cast in Thor, more Spider-Man 4 rumorsPlus, Brian Cox may get cast in The Hobbitby Greg Dean Schmitz | November 21, 2009 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes casting news and rumors for Thor, Spider-Man 4, The Hobbit and Guardians of Ga’hoole, new sequels in the Jackass and Underworld franchises and potential new movies for Brad Pitt and Eddie Murphy.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 THOR FINALLY FINDS HIS WARRIORS THREEDirector Kenneth Branagh has lined up four of the remaining roles in Thor, and three of them make up classic comic book trio: the Warriors Three. Branagh’s choices, however, are not without potential controversy. Let’s start with the least controversial, which is pretty boy Stuart Townsend as pretty boy swashbuckler type, Fandral. Then, there’s the role of Volstagg, which undoubtedly had every chubby actor in Hollywood calling his agent, hoping to get a reading (Chris Farley would have had to gain some weight to portray Volstagg the way he’s drawn in the comics). But nope, instead, Branagh went with the decidedly non-obese Ray Stevenson (Punisher: War Zone, and Titus Pollo from HBO’s Rome). So, will Stevenson be wearing a massive fat suit like Kevin Durand did as the Blob in X-Men Origins: Wolverine? Finally, there is Hogun the Grim, who will be played by Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano. Asano would seem like an odd choice to be playing a god in a movie about Norse mythology, but Stan Lee, way back in the early 1960s, was apparently thinking ahead, because there is a loophole here, in that Hogun is not a member of the Aesir (the race of gods that everyone else in Thor belongs to). So, if Hogun isn’t an Aesir, he can be played by… basically anyone (and Hogun does indeed look sort of Asian-ish in the comics). That, however, doesn’t explain the other casting news this week, which is who will be playing Heimdall, the guardian of the rainbow bridge that leads into Asgard, and who (if we’re sticking to the Hogun argument) is indeed a member of the Aesir. Heimdall will be played by Idris Elba, the African-American actor who is best known for costarring in HBO’s The Wire. Perhaps the thinking with casting Elba as Heimdall is that he spends most of his time wearing a massive helmet covering his face, so his race doesn’t really matter. Although that argument is sort of a slippery slope, as it could lead to Robert Downey Jr. losing his job on Iron Man 3, right?#2 THIS WEEK IN SPIDER-MAN 4 CASTING RUMORSLast week, it was reported that Rachel McAdams was a top contender for the role of Black Cat (AKA Felicia Hardy) in Spider-Man 4. That didn’t mean she had actually landed the role, but Entertainment Weekly apparently didn’t get the memo, so they went to the actress to ask if she had been cast, and she said she hadn’t. I suppose it’s more fun to shoot down a rumor that doesn’t exist, rather than to try to dig up some new facts. I don’t know if either of the following are hard facts, but here we go, as McAdams is not the only name being bandied about to play Hardy this week. First up, UGO reported that Julia Stiles had met for the role, and then Deadline.com reported the same about Anne Hathaway. While all this is going on, there’s another completely different casting call for the movie going on, which is the search for a 2-3 year old boy with red hair. The hot speculation is that the toddler could be playing a potential baby boy for Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, but really, couldn’t Mary Jane just as likely have a little nephew or something in the movie? They better just not ask Rachel McAdams to babysit.#3 ELROND, FARAMIR, BARBOSSA AND DAMIEN WILL BE GUARDIANS OF GA’HOOLEDirector Zach Snyder’s next movie after Watchmen is the CGI animated adventure Guardians of Ga’hoole (scheduled for 9/24/10), and the voice cast now appears to be firmed up. And it’s got an impressive number of actors known for roles in genre movies that Snyder is probably a fan of. The latest additions are Sam Neill (Jurassic Park), Geoffrey Rush (Pirates of the Caribbean), Hugo Weaving (The Matrix, Lord of the Rings) and David Wenham (Lord of the Rings), and they join a cast that includes Helen Mirren (The Queen), Emilie de Ravin (LOST), Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe) and Abbie Cornish, who will also be costarring in Snyder’s next film after this, Sucker Punch. Guardians of Ga’hoole is an adaptation of a series of children’s fantasy novels about heroic owls who are involved in an epic battle for control of their forest.#4 MIGHT BRIAN COX SOON BE SPORTING A +5 BEARD?This one is just a rumor for now, but it’s also concerning Guillermo del Toro’s two-movie adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit, so (as with Spidey’s girlfriends) even rumors get noted here. This week’s AICN Down Under report has heard that casting is starting to get underway for the many actors that will be needed to portray the 13 dwarves that accompany Bilbo Baggins on his adventures. The top contender is… Brian Cox, the prolific Scottish actor whose many film roles include Agamemnon in Troy, Stryker in X2: X-Men United and Jason Bourne’s ex-boss in The Bourne Identity (and he was also great in HBO’s Deadwood). AICN doesn’t know exactly what role Cox is up for, but he seems a likely choice to be playing Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the company of dwarves. There had been speculation at one point that John Rhys-Davies, who played the dwarf Gimli, might return to play a dwarf in The Hobbit as well, but recently Rhys-Davies has stood by his promise after wrapping Lord of the Rings that he would never play a dwarf again, as the makeup played havoc with his skin (which you can see in the DVD extras, as his face got all red and swollen and generally painful looking).#5 JACKASS 3-D: FULL ON RIGHT IN YOUR FACEParamount Pictures has updated their slate for 2010, and one of the new titles pretty much says it all: Jackass 3-D. That’s right, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera and the rest of the wacky Jackass crew are coming to your local theater once again, and this time it’ll be in 3-D. Filming starts in January, 2010 at locations around the world, including Finland, Mongolia and South Africa. That’s pretty much all that is known right now.#6 BRAD PITT WANTS TO TAKE YOU INTO A DARK VOIDBrad Pitt’s Plan B production company has signed a deal to develop a movie based upon the upcoming video game Dark Void, which comes out in January, 2010 on various platforms (and yet Variety calls it a “computer game”). The story of Dark Void follows a pilot who crashes in the Bermuda Triangle and finds himself in a parallel world where aliens with superior technology have taken over Earth, and then he has to, you know, shoot at and blow up bad guys. Dark Void is being seen as a starring vehicle for Pitt, as well as a potential franchise, although one would expect that the possibility of multiple movies probably would depend upon whether the game itself is popular enough to warrant sequels.#7 JERRY BRUCKHEIMER JOINS THE ALIEN LEGIONJerry Bruckheimer is producing an adaptation of the 1980s comic book series Alien Legion for Disney. It’s currently being rewritten by Derek Haas and Michael Brandt, the writing team responsible for cowriting Wanted, 3:10 to Yuma and next summer’s The A-Team. Alien Legion was published by Epic Comics, a creator-owned imprint of Marvel Comics, and followed the adventures of a group of intergalactic soldiers from many different alien species who operated as a sort of outer space version of the French Foreign Legion. Alien Legion is unusual for Jerry Bruckheimer, who has traditionally not ventured into true science fiction very often (not counting stuff like Armageddon). For Disney, meanwhile, Alien Legion fits right into the studio’s current efforts to do exactly that, with the studio currently in production of both John Carter of Mars and Tron: Legacy.#8 EDDIE MURPHY MAY GO ON THE MISADVENTURES OF FLUFFYOne of the things that critics often opine about when reviewing Eddie Murphy’s latest crappy kids’ movie is that they wish he would return to the “blue” material that got his career started, back when he was the hottest thing in Hollywood. Well, here’s a possibility. Eddie Murphy is attached to produce (and possibly star in) a R-rated comedy for Paramount Pictures called The Misadventures of Fluffy, which is described as being a talking animals “road trip” movie through the streets of New York that also has “an element of social comedy reminscent of Murphy’s 1980’s hit Trading Places.” The Misadventures of Fluffy doesn’t currently have a director, and the script (which was sold on spec) is by newcomers Sam Pitman and Adam Cole-Kelly. So, is the world ready for an Eddie Murphy talking animals movie that is NOT suitable for minors?#9 JENNY TO PLAY WINNIEJennifer Hudson (Dreamgirls) has signed to star in Winnie, a drama about the life of Winnie Mandela, the ex-wife of Nelson Mandela. Based upon the biography Winnie Mandela: A Life the film will depict Mandela as both a wife who was a steadfast supporter of her activist husband during his years in prison, her later association with a bodyguard who tortured and murdered a 14-year-old, and her 2003 conviction of fraud. Winnie will be directed by Darrell Roodt, whose 2004 film Yesterday was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Language Film category, and who also directed the 2004 direct-to-video horror sequel Dracula 3000. Production is scheduled to start on May 30, 2010 in South Africa at locations in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Transkei and Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was a prisoner for 18 years.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK#1 UNDERWORLD 4: VIC MACKEY VS GOTH VAMPIRES AND THEIR SCRUFFY WEREWOLF PALSScreen Gems is starting development on a fourth movie in their Underworld franchise by hiring writer John Hlavin, who has no feature films to his credit, but he did write two episodes of The Shield. Neither Kate Beckinsale, who starred in the first two movies, or Rhona Mitra, who starred in the third, have signed on for a fourth movie, and there’s no director yet either. The details of the story this time around are currently being kept secret, but what writer Hlavin has revealed is that it’s not a prequel (like the third film in the series). As for what else the movie might entail, that’s anyone’s guess, but my hunch is that the nights will be awfully well-lit, and that nearly everyone will wear black. Oh, and werewolves will probably fight vampires. This one is a Rotten Idea just based upon the RT averages of the first three movies (30%, 12% and 32%).For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"finale, Shudder, what, romance","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Idris-Elba-cast-in-Thor-more-SpiderMan-4-rumors"},{"id":"47509230583577","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Conan Gets a New Austrian Bodybuilder","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Conan Gets a New Austrian BodybuilderPlus Tom and JJ return for another Mission: Impossibleby Greg Dean Schmitz | June 19, 2009 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you the usual news about sequels (James Bond, Mission: Impossible) and remakes (Conan, Bride of Frankenstein, Meatballs) as well as a refreshing number of original concepts, including news about fan favorite directors Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler), John Carpenter (The Thing) and Andrew Stanton (WALL-E).#1 THE NEW CONAN HAS BEEN FOUND, AND HE’S A LOT LIKE THE OLD ONELionsgate and Nu Image/Millennium have apparently settled upon their choice for the star of the new Conan movie, and he bears a lot of similarities to the original movie Conan, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Roland Kickinger is a 41 year old Austrian bodybuilder-turned-actor, whereas Arnold Schwarzenegger was a 35 year old Austrian bodybuilder-turned-actor when he starred in 1982’s Conan the Barbarian. Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in the first three Terminator movies, and Roland Kickinger played a T-800 robot in Terminator: Salvation. Also, Roland Kickinger actually played Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 2005 A&amp;E made-for-cable biopic See Arnold Run. The casting of Roland Kickinger seems to be an attempt to hew as closely to Schwarzenegger’s films as possible. Hopefully this reboot will attempt to bring in more elements of the awesome sword &amp; sorcery lore and mythology of Robert E. Howard’s original stories (though many fans feel the movies were quite unfaithful to Howard’s stories). Filming of Conan begins in the fall of 2009 in Bulgaria, and will be directed by Marcus Nispel (the remakes of Friday the 13th and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) from a script by Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer (cowriters of Sahara and A Sound of Thunder). The Hollywood Reporter ends their article with a zinger that I have to repeat: “No word on whether Arnold will make a cameo — or on whether Kickinger will run for governor.”#2 FROM GAMBIT TO JOHN CARTER OF MARSBefore casting the live action adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ John Carter of Mars novels, someone at Walt Disney Pictures apparently had just seen X-Men Origins: Wolverine, as the studio has cast Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins (that movie’s Gambit and Silver Fox) as John Carter, the title character of the franchise and Dejah Thoris, the title character of the first novel, Princess of Mars. John Carter of Mars is the story of a Civil War veteran who finds himself mysteriously teleported to Mars, where the lower gravity makes him a superman of sorts, capable of great strength and heroic leaps into the air. Carter quickly finds himself a pivotal player in the wars between the various races, allying himself with Dejah Thoris, the princess of the city state of Helium and with Tars Tarkas, a fierce green-skinned, four-armed insectoid warrior. TThomas Haden Church (Sideways, Spider-Man 3) also revealed this week that he has been cast in John Carter of Mars in an unknown role. John Carter of Mars is the live action debut of director Andrew Stanton, who has helmed six of Pixar’s most popular movies, including Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo and WALL-E. Filming will start in November, 2009 and last until July, 2009 (at nine months, that’s quite a long shoot) and will happen at various locations in Utah, a state that has has provided the exotic desert settings for movies like Planet of the Apes and the latest Star Trek (it posed as Spock’s home world of Vulcan). It’s interesing to know that as Burroughs wrote the John Carter books, the inhabitants of Mars did not wear any clothing except for the odd bits of jewelry. Somehow, I don’t think Disney is going to give us a big fantasy epic showcasing thousands of naked guys and gals running around in the desert (though maybe that will happen in the inevitable porn knock off, John Holmes of Mars).#3 JAMES BOND ONLY LIVES TWENTY-THRICEMGM and EON Productions have hired three writers to work on the 23rd entry in the James Bond franchise. The film (as yet unnamed) will be the third movie featuing Daniel Craig as the legendary British spy. Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost/Nixon) will be working with the team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who also cowrote the two previous Daniel Craig Bond films, as well as Die Another Day, The World is Not Enough and the spy spoof Johnny English. There are no details on the plot yet, but there is a rumor about the villian, although the source is a British tabloid (which makes it highly questionable). According to The Daily Express, Michael Sheen, who starred Frost/Nixon and The Queen, is being considered as one of 007’s most classic villains, Ernst Blofeld (the head of the evil SPECTRE organization). Blofeld appeared in six classic James Bond films, and was portrayed by four different actors. Blofeld is also famous for being the obvious inspiration for Mike Myers’ Dr. Evil character in the Austin Powers franchise (in particular, Donald Pleasance’s performance in 1967’s You Only Live Twice). On the other hand, the Blofeld rumor could be completely untrue, and the Sheen rumor just based on Peter Morgan’s involvement. MGM is hoping to have the script written and the movie produced in time for a 2011 release.#4 TOM CRUISE AND J.J. ABRAMS TAKING ON ANOTHER IMPOSSIBLE MISSIONTom Cruise and Star Trek director J.J. Abrams have agreed to co-produce a fourth entry in their Mission: Impossible franchise for Paramount Pictures, and they’re aiming for a 2011 release. Although 2006’s Mission: Impossible III (directed by Abrams) earned $134 million, it was considered a disappointment relative to the first two movies. That disappointment was cited as part of the reason that Paramount ended their 14 year partnership with Cruise. 2011 is the target year for Star Trek 2, which J.J. Abrams will direct, so it’s unlikely that he’ll be directing M:I IV. There is no writer attached yet, and as such, no word on what the premise this time around might be. The plans to revive Mission: Impossible are apparently due to Viacom chief Sumner Redstone’s interest in repairing his relationship with Tom Cruise, whom he now calls “a great actor and a good friend.”#5 HERE COMES THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEINUniversal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment are in talks with Neil Burger (The Illusionist, Interview with the Assassin) to write and direct their long-in-development remake of the classic 1935 monster movie Bride of Frankenstein. Although 1931’s Frankenstein has been remade several times (since Mary Shelley’s book is in the public domain), Bride of Frankenstein was only remade once, as 1985’s The Bride, starring Jennifer Beals and Sting. In James Whale’s original film (which many, including me, consider superior to Frankenstein), the Monster convinces the retired Dr. Frankenstein to create a female mate who ultimately rejects the Monster’s advances, leading to a disastrous ending. Previous attempts by Universal to remake Bride of Frankenstein had a modern setting, but there’s no word yet as to what Burger’s setting or take will be. Bride of Frankenstein is just one of several projects at Universal trying to revive old monster franchises, in addition to this fall’s The Wolf Man, and revivals of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Invisible Man and Creature from the Black Lagoon.#6 HAPPY TRAILS FOR THE KING OF THE COWBOYS821 Entertainment, a Nashville-based production company (that includes “redneck/hillbilly comedy” in its list of target genres), has acquired the film rights to all intellectual properties of the Roy Rogers Family, announcing plans for a “King of the Cowboys” film trilogy. In an unusual twist, the “characters” of Roy Rogers, his wife and partner Dale Evans and Rogers’ trusty steed Trigger will star in the King of the Cowboys movies, which will not be biopics, or traditional cowboy Westerns, but instead belong to the “family fantasy adventure” genre. Variety describes Roy Rogers as the “top Western box office star from 1943-1954,” who starred in “more than 88 films with Evans and Trigger; produced and starred in 100 episodes of his own TV show; and appeared on more than 400 licensed items, with 120 million comic books sold.” So, who does the RT community think would be a good choice to star as the new Roy Rogers and Dale Evans?#7 NATALIE PORTMAN TO DANCE FOR ARONOFSKY IN BLACK SWANNatalie Portman is now attached to star in Black Swan, a supernatural thriller being developed by director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream). Black Swan started as a project at Universal Pictures, but was put into turnaround before the success of The Wrestler (d’oh!), so Aronofsky’s Protozoa Pictures is now shopping Black Swan to other distributors. In Black Swan, Portman would play a veteran New York City ballet dancer who finds herself locked into an increasingly competitive situation with a rival dancer. Leading up to a big performance, she starts to wonder if the other dancer is actually a “supernatural apparition” or perhaps just a figment of her imagination. Mark Heyman, coproducer of The Wrestler, has rewritten the original draft by John McLaughlin (cowriter of the 2005 comedy Man of the House). It is unclear if Black Swan will be Aronofsky’s next project, since he is also developing the reboot of Robocop, which MGM reportedly is now pegging as a 2011 release instead of the previously announced 2010.#8 LEONARDO DICAPRIO CLICKS ON “DOUBLE DOWN” FOR ONLINE CASINO MOVIELeonardo DiCaprio will produce and star in an untitled project for Paramount set in the shady world of online casino sites based in Costa Rica. With this movie, the writing team of Brian Koppelman and David Levien are establishing somewhat of a reputation for stories set in the world of gambling, following Ocean’s Thirteen and 1998’s Rounders. Koppelman and Levien are also working with DiCaprio and his Appian Way production company on Beat the Reaper. That script is based on a crime novel about a former hitman who enters witness protection and takes up a new career as a medical resident at a hospital where he encounters a mobster whose life he must save. In other DiCaprio news, this week Bloody Disgusting broke the news that the two-part live action remake of the classic sci-fi anime film Akira is “dead as a doornail” at Warner Bros.#9 ADRIEN BRODY, FOREST WHITAKER AND ELIJAH WOOD SUBJECTS OF THE EXPERIMENTAdrien Brody (The Pianist), Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland), Elijah Wood (Frodo in Lord of the Rings) and Cam Gigandet (Twlight, Never Back Down) have signed to star in the English language remake of the chilling 2001 German psychological thriller, Das Experiment. Inspired by the true story of the 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, Das Experiment was the story of a reporter who goes undercover as a participant in a psychological study in which men are given the roles of either “guards” or “inmates” to determine how social roles determine morality and choices. As you might expect, the experiment goes horribly wrong. Paul Scheuring, the creator, producer and writer of Fox’s somewhat similarly-themed Prison Break is making his directorial debut with The Experiment. Adrien Brody will be playing the leader of the inmates (which might be the reporter role) and Forest Whitaker will be playing one of the “prison” guards. The Experiment is an independent production and is scheduled to start filming in Iowa in July, 2009.#10 DANIELLE PANABAKER AND AMBER HEARD CHECKING INTO JOHN CARPENTER’S THE WARDFan-favorite horror and thriller director John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) hasn’t made a movie since 2001’s Ghosts of Mars, but he’s returned from an 8-year hiatus, and will start filming a psychological horror thriller called The Ward next month in Spokane, Washington. This week, the production found more of its cast, mostly young actresses. Amber Heard (Never Back Down, Pineapple Express) is starring in The Ward as Kristen, a young woman who is committed to a psychiatric facility, where she meets other patients, as well as a mysterious girl who roams the halls of the ward at night. Danielle Panabaker (Friday the 13th, Sky High) will be playing a flirtatious and snobbish patient who is facing the threat of electoshock therapy, and Mamie Gummer (Stop-Loss) will play another patient. The original script was written by Michael and Shawn Rasmussen (cowriters of 2005’s direct-to-video thriller Long Distance), and was rewritten by Jim Agnew and Sean Keller, the writers of Dario Argento’s latest film, Giallo.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: PARAMOUNT ORDERING SECONDS OF MEATBALLS1979’s Meatballs is a modern comedy classic, basically inventing the “summer camp” subgenre that spawned three inferior sequels in the 1980s and 1990s, other usually awful summer camp movies like Camp Nowhere, Heavyweights and American Pie Presents: Band Camp and ultimately the 2001 homage comedy, Wet Hot American Summer. Meatballs still stands up today as a very funny movie, and was also the first film for Bill Murray (who had just replaced Chevy Chase on Saturday Night Live). Meatballs was also the first hit for director Ivan Reitman, who went on to work with Bill Murray again in Stripes, Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II. Unfortunately, it might just be the strong legacy of Meatballs that has led Paramount Pictures to revisit the franchise. The new Meatballs is expected to be a remake, with hopes that it will inspire a new series of Meatballs movies. Hollywood’s obsession with remaking, rebooting and revamping favorites of the past of the past continues, and now not even Meatballs is safe from reimagining.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"TLC, show, Netflix, BBC, Star, Spectrum, hispanic, doctor, Films, universal, Network","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Conan-Gets-a-New-Austrian-Bodybuilder"},{"id":"47509230549777","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Bryan Singer takes on Battlestar Galactica","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Bryan Singer takes on Battlestar GalacticaPlus WB announces a LEGO movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 14, 2009 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup features the usual smorgasbord of movie concepts. An old TV show? Check! A video game? Check! A popular toy franchise? Check! A biopic about a dead musician? Check! David Mamet doing The Diary of Anne Frank and some Brits are making 3D musicals based on the works of William Shakespeare… Check?#1 BRYAN SINGER MOVING FROM X-MEN AND SUPERMAN TO BATTLESTAR GALACTICAUniversal Pictures has signed Bryan Singer to produce and direct a feature version of the popular sci-fi TV franchise, Battlestar Galactica. Bryan Singer’s career got started with the award-winning The Usual Suspects, but most fans might best know him as the director of the first two X-Men movies and 2006’s Superman Returns. Years ago, Singer had been developing a new Battlestar Galactica TV series, but reportedly plans were scrapped after the events of September 11, 2001, when it was felt a TV show about a city being attacked and destroyed wouldn’t be well received. A few years later, Ronald Moore produced his own take on a Battlestar Galactica relaunch, and the show just went off the air after 73 episodes. It is unknown if Moore will be involved at all with this new Galactica movie, and it’s being produced by Glen Larson, creator of the orginal 1970s show. Since Singer’s approach is being called a “complete re-imagination,” it’s expected that there will be no direct ties between Moore’s recent series and this new movie, which will relaunch the concept for a second time. There’s no word yet as to who will be writing the script for this new Battlestar Galactica either. My hunch is that we can probably expect Singer’s Galactica to have a lighter tone than Ronald Moore’s rather dire and dark TV series. I’m basing this upon a suspicion that Singer’s inspiration will be the actual original 1970s series (as opposed to Moore’s version). That would gel with a lot of what we know about Singer’s tastes, as he’s long talked about developing a Logan’s Run remake, and his Superman Returns slavishly paid homage to 1978’s Superman. So, Bryan Singer definitely likes 1970s science fiction properties, which suggests he might like the original Battlestar Galactica more than the 2000s remake, right? Having said that, here’s hoping he doesn’t include the cute little kid and his robot dog.#2 WARNER BROS BUILDING A LEGO MOVIE ONE CGI PLASTIC BRICK AT A TIMEWith Transformers 2 and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra both being big hits this summer, Hollywood’s newest fascination with toy-inspired movies continued this week with the news that Warner Bros is developing a movie based on the building bricks of LEGO. Screenwriting brothers Dan and Kevin Hageman (the upcoming CGI animated Hotel Transylvania) are said to be writing a family comedy that will be a mix of live action and CGI animation. The exact details of the plot are being kept secret, but it’s described as being an adventure in a world of LEGOs. The Danish toy company has worked with Hollywood before, on the Bionicle direct-to-DVD movies, but this project is much more ambitious. Although the news of this project seems inspired by the recent successes of toy-inspired movies, Warner Bros has actually been already been developing the LEGO movie for the past year. That makes sense, considering that Warner Bros has worked with LEGO in the past, allowing characters like Batman, Harry Potter and Speed Racer to be adapted as LEGO game sets, as well as collaberating on the LEGO Batman video game.#3 HITMAN AND KANE &amp; LYNCH PRODUCER NEXT TAKING ON A JUST CAUSEAdrian Askarieh, producer of the Hitman and Kane &amp; Lynch projects at Lionsgate, has acquired the rights to another Eidos videogame property, the 2006 hit, Just Cause. In Just Cause, players take on the role of The Scorpion, a CIA black ops assassin who specializes in using base jumping and grappling hooks for high-altitude action adventures. The developers have described the character as “as a mix of Jason Bourne, James Bond, Wolverine, and Rambo, with a touch of Enrique Iglesias.” Eidos is currently preparing for the release of Just Cause 2 in 2010. Askarieh is looking to make Just Cause an independent production, and is rounding up a budget of $30 million, which seems a bit on the low side for an action thriller. While Just Cause is being developed, Askarieh also expects filming of Kane &amp; Lynch, which will costar Bruce Willis, to start in 2010.#4 HAMLET 3D: TO BE OR NOT TO BE… IN YOUR FACE!In order for Hollywood’s fascination with 3D to evolve into something other than a cheap trick, the technology will have to eventually be used for something a bit more upscale than say, Space Chimps 3D. A British producer may have figured exactly what that might be, with news of plans for a series of 3D movie musicals based upon the works of William Shakespeare. Based upon the musical adaptations produced by a company called Shakespeare 4 Kids, the first movie will be Hamlet, with the other titles in the series being Romeo and Juliet, MacBeth, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Twelfth Night and The Tempest. The movies will be produced at a fast pace, with the first three expected to be finished within a period of 18 months. Simultaneously, the producers will also launch Movie Quest: A Romeo 4 Juliet, a competitive reality show that will seek young British talent to star as the starcrossed lovers. As for Hamlet, here’s some examples of what the producers expect to wow people with in 3D, “a ghost that hovers in front of the audience’s eyes, cannon fire that flies into the auditorium and a sword fight that appears to happen all around viewers.” What, no floating skull in our laps during Hamlet’s “Alas, poor Yorick” monologue?#5 DAVID MAMET TO APPLY HIS UNIQUE SENSE OF LANGUAGE TO THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANKScreenwriter and playwright David Mamet, who is known for both his loose use of obscenities in movies like Glengarry Glen Ross and Homicide and for a style of dialogue that is heavy on pauses and short, often interrupted sentences, has found strange bedfellows for his latest project. Walt Disney Pictures has acquired the rights to David Mamet’s adaptation of The Diary of Anne Frank, the frequently-adapted memoir left behind by a young Jewish girl who did not survive the Holocaust. Mamet’s script will reportedly be a hybrid of Frank’s diary, the stage adaptation and Mamet’s own take, which reframes the story as a young girl’s rite of passage (although that’s what I was taught it was in school some 25 years ago). It’s worth noting that David Mamet has indeed gone outside what might be considered his comfort zone in the past, most notably with his adaptation of The Winslow Boy a drama set in the early 20th Century. Anne Frank was, of course, a 15 year old girl who died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945 after living with her family in hiding in Amsterdam, where she wrote her famous diary. A 1959 big screen adaptation of The Diary of Anne Frank earned Shelley Winters an Oscar, and the memoir has since been adapted for television several times.#6 NASHVILLE TO HANK WILLIAMS BIOPIC: HEY, GOOD LOOKIN’Nashville-based 821 Entertainment Group and Strike Entertainment have teamed up to develop a biopic about the life of country music legend Hank Williams. Growing up poor in Alabama during the Great Depression, Hank Williams rocketed to country stardom in the 1940s, releasing 11 #1 hits, before his addiction to alcohol and morphine led to his death at just 29 on New Year’s Day, 1953. Williams’ hit songs included “Hey, Good Lookin'”, “Lovesick Blues,” “Moanin’ the Blues,” “Long Gone Lonesome Blues,” “Your Cheating Heart,” “Cold Cold Heart,” “Take These Chains From My Heart,” and “I’ll Never Get Out of This World Alive.” Williams’ children and grandchildren have also followed him with careers in country music, with the most obvious one being Hank Williams, Jr., who many people know as the “Are You Ready for Some Football?” guy. Strike Entertainment partner Marc Abraham, who wrote some episodes of Moonlighting and 21 Jump Street, will adapt the Colin Escott book, Hank Williams: The Biography. 821 Entertainment has been on a bit of a run recently; they are also developing a trilogy of King of the Cowboys Roy Rogers movies and an adaptation the 1999 John Grisham novel The Testament.#7 FRANKENSTEIN SAYS: LET’S DO THE DEATH RACE AGAINPaul W.S. Anderson is producing a prequel to his 2008 remake of Death Race, which grossed $74 million in the U.S. Death Race was a futuristic action thriller about inmates who are forced to drive destructive vehicles against each other. The prequel, which is based upon an idea by Anderson and is being written by Tony Giglio (who may direct) will focus on the origin story for the racer who became known as Frankenstein. Frankenstein was the character played by the late David Carradine in the original 1975 film, and was also voiced by Carradine in the 2008 movie. Paul W.S. Anderson is currently busy on pre-production of Resident Evil: Afterlife, but after that film wraps, he will move on as producer to focus on development of this Death Race prequel.#8 MEET THE NEWEST VAMPIRE HUNTER IN CRIMINAL MACABREUniversal Pictures has acquired the rights to Criminal Macabre, a Dark Horse comic book mini-series by Steve Niles, whose 30 Days of Night was adapted as a horror movie in 2007. Criminal Macabre follows the daily adventures of a hard living private detective named Cal McDonald who uses a network of friendly ghouls on his own personal mission to take out the worst of the vampires, ghosts and other supernatural monsters that plague Los Angeles. Kyle Ward, who is also working on screenplays for Hitman 2 and the videogame adaptations Kane &amp; Lynch and Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune, has been hired to adapt the script.#9 ALEXANDER PAYNE’S FOLLOWING THE DESCENDANTS TO HAWAIIDirector Alexander Payne (Election, About Schmidt) and Fox Searchlight are reteaming again on Payne’s next movie, The Descendants, his first as director since 2004’s Sideways. Payne expects to start filming The Descendants in Hawaii in late 2009 or early 2010. Payne is currently polishing the script by comedians/actors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, adapted from the novel of the same title by Kaui Hart Hemmings. The Descendants is about a trip from Oahu to Kauai that an affluent attorney (who’s related to Hawaiian royalty, hence the title) takes with his two daughters to meet their mother’s lover after she falls into a coma following a boating accident. Payne had been expected to direct a comedy called Downsizing, which Paul Giamatti, Reese Witherspoon and Sacha Baron Cohen are signed to star in, but Payne has decided to direct The Descendants first. That will allow for more prep time for Downsizing, as it is a more involved production (since it involves shrinking Paul Giamatti).#10 ED HELMS JOINS THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCYUniversal Pictures has acquired a spec script called Central Intelligence as a starring vehicle for Ed Helms, star of NBC’s The Office and this summer’s The Hangover. Written by Ike Barinholtz (MadTV) and newcomer Dave Stassen, Central Intelligence is the story of an accountant who becomes involved in the world of international espionage and intrigue after reconnecting with an old friend via Facebook. Helms’ next movie will be Cedar Rapids, in which he plays an insurance agent trying to save his friends’ jobs, and in the fall of 2010, he will start filming The Hangover 2.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: SPACE CHIMPS PRODUCER ADAPTING THE OZ WARSThis week’s Rotten Idea is a doozie. First, the set up: Vanguard Films is the animation company responsible for Space Chimps, Valiant and Happily N’ever After. They’re currently preparing for the release of Space Chimps 3D, which will wisely go direct-to-dvd in the United States (but the rest of the world won’t be as lucky), and something called Alien Band: The Battle of the Bands Just Got Ugly. But wait, I haven’t even gotten to the Rotten Idea yet. Last month, Vanguard’s boss John H. Williams was at the San Diego Comic-Con, which is increasingly where Hollywood types with a lot of cash in their pockets go, looking for a cool new movie idea. At Comic-Con, Williams saw a gallery for an upcoming graphic novel called The Oz Wars, which was written by an “established screenwriter,” writing under the pseudonym of Dorothy Gale. The Oz Wars is the story of a war between the Witches and the resistance fighters led by Wizard of Oz. I suspect that really, the producer of Space Chimps was just excited that this would give him an excuse to use CGI flying monkeys (although the movie itself will apparently be one of Vanguard’s first live-action movies… it’ll still probably have CGI flying monkeys). Vanguard also picked up a graphic novel called Circus Galactus, which is unfortunately not about the great, purple Devour of Worlds attending and enjoying a three ring circus. That, I would produce myself. Going back to the concept of someone, anyone, making a new movie based upon L. Frank Baum’s Oz, I think that would be fine, perhaps, but if you’re going to do it, do it right. Actually adapt one of the many great books that Baum actually wrote, not some comic book you found at Comic Con. Hey, I love comic books, but like any medium, they’re not all Watchmen, Hellboy and Kingdom Come. In fact, plenty of comic books are pretty crappy. And the same is true of video games or toys or whatever Hollywood decides will be their next hot new thing. Keep that in mind, producers, the next time you feel the urge to throw money at an idea.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"worst, movies, Photos, BET, Year, YouTube, comedy, sag","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Bryan-Singer-takes-on-Battlestar-Galactica"},{"id":"47509230567189","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Paramount Toying Around with Max Steel","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Paramount Toying Around with Max SteelPlus casting news for Willem Dafoe, Natalie Portman, and Hugh Jackmanby Greg Dean Schmitz | July 17, 2009 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup includes the requisite toy movie, but thankfully there are no remakes (although there is one movie based on an old TV show and two different movies based on young adult book series). Included in the original concepts are two comedies about today’s economic hard times, a biopic about a classic children’s book author, a historical epic about King Henry V and a time travel sci-fi action movie called Arena.#1 PARAMOUNT IS TOYING AROUND WITH MAX STEELWith Paramount just a couple of weeks away from releasing G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, the studio has found another action figure franchise in the form of Mattel’s Max Steel. Max Steel started as an action figure in 1999 and starred in an animated TV series from 2000-2002. It’s apparently proven to be much more successful in Latin America, where Max Steel is the #1 action figure property. For those not familiar with the character, Max Steel is a 19-year-old extreme sports enthusiast who is injured in an accident that infects his body with nanobots that make him superhuman. This leads to him being recruited by a secret agency, where he is of course teamed up with lots of other action figure-friendly characters. Mattel hopes that a major motion picture will help relaunch the toy line in the United States and other regions outside of Latin America. There is currently no writer or director attached to Max Steel, or word on when Paramount plans on releasing this latest toy property, which now joins the toy-to-movie ranks at Paramount, alongside Hasbro’s Transformers and G.I. Joe franchises.#2 BRIDGET JONES TO OBSESS ABOUT HER WEIGHT AND LOVE LIFE ONE MORE TIME?Variety is reporting that it is “rumored” that Working Title is developing a third movie in the Bridget Jones series. This would follow the two movies based upon books by Helen Fielding, despite there not being a third novel to adapt for a third movie. Instead, it is expected that this third movie will be based upon columns that Fielding wrote in 2005 for the British newspaper The Independent, in which Bridget, now in her 40s, attempts to have a baby before it’s too late. Renee Zellweger did just turn 40 this past April, so the timing is quite on the mark. Another bit of news for Working Title this week is that the British production company has hired Cate Blanchett to star in Indian Summer, a drama set in 1947 in the final days of British rule of India. That film has been written by William Nicholson (Shadowlands, First Knight) and will be directed by Joe Wright (Atonement, The Soloist).#3 BARELY REMEMBERED 1960S WESTERN THE BIG VALLEY HEADED TO THE BIG SCREENIn quite unexpected news, the 1965-1969 ABC family western TV series The Big Valley is being developed as a movie scheduled to start filming in April, 2010 in Michigan and New Mexico. The Big Valley was the story of a widowed matriarch (Barbara Stanwyck) of the prosperous Barkley ranch in central California, and her three sons (including an illegitimate half-brother played by Lee Majors) and a daughter (Linda Evans). The show was very similar to the long-running Bonanza, if you switch Lorne Greene out for Barbara Stanwyck, and use a less dusty setting. The concept for this Big Valley movie was developed by the show’s creators, and is being produced by Kate Edelman Johnson, the daughter of original show runner Louis F. Edelman. The Big Valley was written and will be written by Daniel Adams, who also directed this year’s independent drama The Golden Boys, starring David Carradine, Bruce Dern and Rip Torn. There’s no word yet about who will be cast in the movie’s five major roles.#4 THIS WEEK IN CASTING: JOHN CARTER OF MARS, THOR, I HOP, STRAW DOGSRather than take up four slots on the list that could go to new projects, this entry will cover this week’s major bits of casting news. First up is the announcement that Willem Dafoe has joined the cast of John Carter of Mars as Tars Tarkas, the four-armed giant green warrior that befriends Carter when he arrives on Mars. It’s not known how exactly Dafoe will portray Tarkas, but my best guess would be some sort of motion capture CGI animation. Then there is is the confirmation that Natalie Portman will be costarring in Thor as Jane Foster, but this news actually first appeared online a few months ago. What’s new is that the movie’s version of Jane Foster will not be a nurse (as portrayed in the comics), but rather a sort of doctor/scientist. This change is most likely due to Thor’s Dr. Donald Blake alter ego from the early comics not being an element in the movie adaptation. Next up is British comedian Russell Brand (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) who will be starring in I Hop, one of the competing Easter-themed movies that is being raced through development. I Hop is the story of a slacker who runs over the real Easter Bunny, breaking his leg so that he can’t hop, and so the guy has to take on the Bunny’s duties. Finally, Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard (HBO’s True Blood) will costar with James Marsden in the remake of Straw Dogs, which moves the story of rape and revenge from England to Mississippi. Bosworth is playing Marsden’s wife, and Skarsgard is playing her high school boyfriend, a former football hero. The changes to the story’s setting and some character elements make this Straw Dogs a hard project to predict, but like most remakes, the real question is… why bother remaking a movie that was already great?#5 DISNEY GIVES MILEY CYRUS WINGSWalt Disney Pictures has acquired Aprilynne Pike’s bestselling young adult novel Wings as a starring vehicle for their Hannah Montana star Miley Cyrus. The first installment of a planned four book series, Wings is the story of a 15 year old girl who discovers that she is actually a faerie. Sent to live among humans as a guardian of the gateway to the magical land of Avalon, she learns about her heritage when a bump on her back blossoms into a giant flower and eventually becomes wings. The faerie falls in love with another faerie as she learns that she is destined to be caught between a war between faeries and trolls over control of the gateway to Avalon. Published in May, Wings has been a success but has also garnered expected comparisons to the popular Twilight franchise, and it just so happens that the producers of Wings also coproduced the first Twilight movie. So, are you looking forward to seeing Miley Cyrus running around with giant flower-like wings bouncing around her shoulders?#6 ED HELMS RECOVERS FROM HIS HANGOVER IN CEDAR RAPIDSWhile two of the leads in this summer’s surprise comedy hit The Hangover, Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis, have been lining up their next movies over the last few weeks, that left Ed Helms, who played the dentist, with a big question mark as to how he would follow up such a major success. Helms, who was a longtime correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and is now on NBC’s The Office has chosen to go the indie comedy route, rather than sign on for another big studio movie just yet. In Cedar Rapids, Helms will play “a sad-sack insurance agent who goes to an industry convention to try to save the jobs of his colleagues.” Cedar Rapids was developed by Helms, written by newcomer writer Phil Johnston, will be directed Miguel Arteta (The Good Girl, Chuck &amp; Buck) and is being produced by director Alexander Payne (Election, Sideways). Filming of Cedar Rapids will start in October, 2009 while Ed Helms is on hiatus from The Office. Several distributors are currently looking at Cedar Rapids, with Fox Searchlight considered to be the frontrunner after having handled many of Payne’s movies. Ed Helms is also writing, and will costar in, an untitled Civil War time travel comedy for Warner Bros, the studio behind The Hangover.#7 PREPARE FOR THE EPIC 15TH CENTURY BATTLE OF AGINCOURTLondon’s Independent Film Company has hired writer and producer Michael Hurst, creator of Showtime’s The Tudors and writer of 1998’s Elizabeth, to adapt the 2008 bestselling novel, Agincourt (also known as Azincourt), by Bernard Cornwell. Agincourt, as you might guess from the title, tells the story of the landmark Battle of Agincourt, which was also the central battle of William Shakespeare’s Henry V. In Cornwell’s novel, the central character is an archer named Nicholas Hook, who earns recognition from King Henry V of England and fights alongside him against the French army in a 1415 battle that proved the superiority of the English longbowmen, in what is considered one of the bloodiest battles in European history. Agincourt will be a $35 million production, with filming expected to start in the spring of 2011.#8 MR. FANTASTIC IS BANKING ON MR. TOADIoan Gruffudd, who is best known for playing Reed Richards in the two Fantastic Four movies has signed on to star in the British biopic Banking on Mr. Toad, with Samantha Morton (Minority Report, In America) in talks to play his character’s wife, Elspeth. In Banking on Mr. Toad, Gruffudd will play 19th century author Kenneth Grahame, who made the transition from a career as a secretary for the Bank of England to the author of The Wind in the Willows, the classic children’s book about anthromorphic animals, including Mr. Toad, Mr. Badger, Ratty and Mole. Banking on Mr. Toad will be helmed by acclaimed director Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy, Tender Mercies, Breaker Morant) from a script by producer Timothy Haas and Wendy Oberman, both of whom are first-time screenwriters. Production is scheduled to start in Ireland later this year.#9 WARNER BROS HIRES DIRECTOR FOR POST-HARRY POTTER BOY WIZARD PROJECT SEPTIMUS HEAPAs filming continues on the two Deathly Hallows movies to wrap up the Harry Potter movie franchise, Warner Bros is apparently looking at how they can continue on in the lucrative boy wizard business. David Frankel (Marley &amp; Me, The Devil Wears Prada) has been hired to direct Septimus Heap: Magyk, an animated adaptation of the first book of a seven part series by Angie Sage, with newcomer Rob Lieber working on the script. Magyk was the first book in the series, published in 2005, and it was followed by Flyte, Physik, and Queste. The fifth book, Syren, comes out this September, with two more books to follow. Septimus Heap is a young wizard who was the seventh son of a seventh son and who must spend seven years studying magic under a powerful wizard before he can eventually take her place. Specifically, Magyk is the book in which 10 year olds Septimus and his adopted sister discover their destinies, which include his sister eventually becoming a princess. Septimus Heap: Magyk is described as an “animated fantasy project,” but it’s currently unknown what company will be handling the animation.#10 NEVER BACK DOWN DIRECTOR READY TO ENTER THE ARENASummit Entertainment is looking to stay in business with Jeff Wadlow, the director of 2008’s Never Back Down (and also 2005’s Cry_Wolf). Wadlow had been attached to direct a prison escape movie called The Tomb, but when that project stalled, the fledgling studio (Twlight, Knowing, Push) has instead switched Wadlow over to a sci-fi action movie called Arena. First time writers Toby Wagstaff and Darren Howell wrote Arena, which is about a group of modern soldiers who find themselves transported to a strange shifting landscape where they are pitted into gladiator-style combat with warriors from throughout history. Although Summit’s output so far hasn’t been spectacular, it’s nice to at least see that this new studio is mostly focusing on original concepts, rather than all of the remakes and other tired concepts that the major studios are currently obsessed with. Arena might turn out to be awful, but the concept is at least sort of awesome.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: HUGH JACKMAN IS AVON MANEconomic hardship is so funny, right up there with Nazis (Life is Beautiful, The Producers) and race relations (Soul Man, White Chicks). And so, there are a lot of movies in the works about people down on their luck (including #6’s Cedar Rapids), and following the intense action of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Hugh Jackman has lined one up as well. In the comedy Avon Man, Jackman will play a recently laid off car salesman who takes a job as an Avon cosmetics salesperson, which is “initially emasculating”, until the story eventually takes on a “Full Monty vibe when the car salesman sets out to save his financially strapped family and town by conscripting his buddies into the makeup business to win a regional contest.” 20th Century Fox acquired the Avon Man pitch in a high six figure deal from Hitch writer Kevin Bisch. Here’s guessing that the Avon Man trailer will feature a scene where Jackman’s girlfriend/wife walks in on him fully made up in the sort of dated makeup women haven’t worn since Maude was a hit.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"on, psycho, The, Arrowverse, Bros., Red, documentary, Nickelodeon, facebook, BBC, Awards, rt, Series","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Paramount-Toying-Around-with-Max-Steel"},{"id":"47509230569238","title":"Weekly Ketchup: T.J.

Hooker Film in DevelopmentPlus a cornucopia of comic book movie news this week.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 10, 2009 |  CommentsThe film development news leading up to the 4th of July was relatively slow, but this week’s Ketchup is overflowing hot news items, including several superhero movies, two TV show adaptations, the requisite relaunch of a 1980s movie, a SNL skit-turned-movie and new projects for Will Smith, George Clooney, Mel Gibson and Jason Statham.#1 T.J. HOOKER TO RIDE A WINDSHIELD RIGHT INTO YOUR LOCAL MOVIE THEATERAlthough Hollywood is still mostly infatuated with remakes, the industry hasn’t forgotten old TV shows, with the latest wave coming mostly from the 1980s (The A-Team, MacGyver, Magnum P.I.), following the previous batch of TV show adaptations that was mostly from the 1970s (Charlie’s Angels, Starsky &amp; Hutch, The Dukes of Hazzard). The latest 1980s TV show to get put into development as a movie is the 1982-1986 ABC (and then CBS) cop drama, T.J. Hooker, which gave William Shatner the opportunity to be known for playing someone other than Captain Kirk (not that it really turned out that way). Shatner played T.J. Hooker, a 15 year veteran uniform cop, as brave and cocksure, becoming famous for frequently jumping on speeding cars or tackling and beating up bad guys. The show also memorably costarred Heather Locklear in a tight cop uniform, and less memorably gave Adrian Zmed his one decent shot at fame. The T.J. Hooker movie plot introduces a new element, focusing on T.J.’s relationship with his father. This gets me to wondering whether the father character might in fact be a role for William Shatner to play, and taking that idea a bit further, could it be that the movie T.J. is actually… T.J. Junior? Anyway, Chuck Russell (Eraser, The Scorpion King) is in talks to direct the currently independent project from a script by Brent Maddock and S.S. Wilson, the writing team responsible for Short Circuit and Tremors (and they also cowrote Wild Wild West). So, who do you think should play the new T.J. Hooker? Think Chris Pine is interested?#2 THIS WEEK IN SUPER HERO MOVIE NEWS: GREEN LANTERN, GREEN HORNET, SUPERMAN, SPIDER-MAN 4With Comic Con just two weeks away, the media buzz for hot superhero movies really revved up this week, with four stories that all could have stood alone in this week’s Ketchup. First up, there is Green Lantern, which is expected to start filming soon, in order to make a late 2010 release date. Warner Bros has reportedly narrowed their choices to play Hal Jordan down to three actors, who were brought in to put on the Green Lantern costume and do some screen shots. And your three possible Hal Jordans are Bradley Cooper (The Hangover), Ryan Reynolds (who also has Deadpool in development) and, perhaps in the category of the most unexpected choice, pop singer Justin Timberlake, who has quietly been doing movie work in movies like Black Snake Moan and Alpha Dog. The reasoning for each seems pretty obvious. Warner Bros is trying to keep most of the guys involved with The Hangover working within the studio. Ryan Reynolds was also once the top choice to star in another Warner Bros superhero project, The Flash, which the studio is still actively developing. And as for Justin Timberlake, well, he’s shown that he can indeed actually act, and he does have an engaging and charismatic personality that could actually work as Hal Jordan (I have to admit!). Previous actors that Warner Bros had been considering were Michael Fassbender, Henry Cavill and Jared Leto. Staying within the realm of Green heroes, another bit of news that escaped this week is that Cameron Diaz is in talks to possibly play the female lead in The Green Hornet, the comedic superhero movie that will star Seth Rogen next summer.Moving on to two of the biggest movie superheroes, next up is news about the next Superman movie. First, this week, Brandon Routh revealed that his holding contract with Warner Bros has expired (which the studio could have renewed), which seems to suggest that the studio will be going with a new actor the next time around. Soon after, a U.S. District Court judge ruled in Warner Bros’ favor in a case filed by the heirs of Superman creator Jerry Siegel. However, the ruling stated “if Warner Bros. does not start production on another Superman film by 2011, the Siegels will be able to sue to recover their damages,” with WB’s Alan Horn saying “that no script had been written and that the earliest another Superman pic could be released would be in 2012.” It should be noted that as long as WB starts production in 2011, aiming for a 2012 release, they would apparently be in the clear. So, with 2011 less than two years away, we can apparently expect to start hearing more about the next Superman soon. Finally, there was also news again this week about Spider-Man 4 getting a new writer, Gary Ross (Pleasantville, Seabiscuit; cowriter of Big), following drafts by James Vanderbilt (Zodiac; cowriter of The Rundown) and David Linsday-Abaire (Inkheart; cowriter of Robots). What is quite interesting about Sony picking Gary Ross is that the star of the two movies that Gary Ross has directed just happens to be Tobey Maguire. Although we still don’t yet know who the villains might be next time around, Sony currently has Spider-Man 4 scheduled for a May 6, 2011 release date.#3 SERIOUS TV DRAMA BAYWATCH BEING TURNED INTO A BIG SCREEN COMEDYThe long-running (11 seasons) beach lifeguard drama Baywatch is moving ahead at Paramount with a new spin being put on the concept: they’re turning it into a comedy. Although one could argue that it was often tricky to take Baywatch seriously, the show was in fact basically a fairly standard TV drama that borrowed elements from both cop and doctor shows, except it was set on a beach and the cast didn’t wear much. For this comedic revamp, Paramount has hired screenwriter Jeremy Garelick (cowriter of 2006’s The Break-Up) to rewrite an older script (that was more of an action movie) by the cowriters of I Spy, and also come aboard to make his directorial debut. Garelick, who had never actually seen Baywatch when he started work on his comedic rewrite, describes his version thusly, “It felt like the template to do a movie that was similar to Stripes and Police Academy, the comedies I loved growing up,”, with the premise now revolving around “two unlikely lifeguard candidates trying to catch on alongside the buff bodies that will be as abundant in the film as they were in the TV series.” So, what do you think, movie and TV fans, are you okay with Baywatch getting turned into a comedy, or being made into a movie at all?#4 MACGRUBER FINDS HIS CAST JUST IN THE NICK OF… (BOOM)Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels is eager to get back in the business of making movies based on his show’s sketches, with the MacGyver spoof MacGruber quickly lining up its cast, in the hopes of beating New Line Cinema’s actual MacGyver movie to theaters. To be distributed by Universal, MacGruber will of course star Will Forte as the inventive adventurer, with SNL‘s Kristen Wiig playing his assistant, Val Kilmer in talks to play the villain Cunth, and Ryan Phillippe in talks to play an Army officer forced to team up with MacGruber. Here’s the premise: “The legendary, much decorated MacGruber is pulled out of retirement as a monk in Ecuador by a colonel, who needs him once more to fight on behalf of his country. This time the mission involves going up against the evil Cunth, who has a nuclear warhead; the mission is personal because Cunth killed MacGruber’s bride.” MacGruber will be directed by Jorma Taccone (Extreme Movie), who created the original SNL skits, from a script by the trio responsible for writing the skits: Will Forte, Taccone and John Solomon, a SNL writer who also cowrote Extreme Movie. The production start date hasn’t been announced yet, but with a cast lined up and the movie on the fast track, it appears likely that it will happen this summer, before Saturday Night Live starts its new season this fall.#5 THE DESTROYER, AKA REMO WILLIAMS, IS READY FOR ACTION ONCE AGAINOne of the most popular pulp novel series of the 1970s and 1980s was Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir’s The Destroyer, who has been featured in over 140 books. The world at large, however, probably knows the character by the name Remo Williams, thanks to the 1985 movie Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, starring Fred Ward. Now, producers Charles Roven (Twelve Monkeys, The Dark Knight) and Steve Chasman (the Transporter franchise and The Bank Job) are teaming up to bring The Destroyer back, setting the project up at Columbia Pictures. Charles and Vlas Parlapanides, who are also working on a Theseus-starring action movie called War of Gods and the Manga adaptation Death Note, have been hired to adapt The Destroyer. The concept of The Destroyer is centered around Remo Williams, a New Jersey cop wrongly convicted of murder, and whose execution is staged, so that he can start a new life as a secret agent and assassin, trained by the humorous Asian martial arts trainer, Chiun. I read at least a dozen Destroyer novels as a teenager, and I can attest that they were economical (and quickly written) but frequently awesome adventure stories that saw Remo travelling the world and getting involved in all sorts of spectacular action sequences and challenges, with dialogue that was often quite humorous and wry. The Destroyer is a great concept for a new action movie franchise, as fans of Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins might remember, even if they never actually read the books.#6 WILL SMITH MAY REUNITE WITH HIS I AM LEGEND DIRECTOR FOR CITY THAT SAILEDWill Smith may reunite with Francis Lawrence, the director of Constantine and Smith’s 2007 hit, I Am Legend on a modern day fantasy film called City That Sailed. This is the second project that may reunite Francis Lawrence and Will Smith, as Lawrence is also developing a prequel to I Am Legend, which would presumably once again feature Smith’s Robert Neville character. City That Sailed, written by Andrew Niccol (The Truman Show, Gattaca) is the tale of a young girl in London who misses her father, a New York City street magician (Smith), and upon discovering a room of magic candles in a lighthouse, makes a wish that sends the entire island of Manhattan ripped from North America and sailing across the Atlantic towards England. It’s a rather spectacular concept for a family fantasy with the potential for a lot of visual spectacle, and Will Smith’s name above the title would probably guarantee it a good bit of box office. Lawrence is also producing City That Sailed, which is one of three projects that he is developing for 20th Century Fox.#7 THE HANGOVER‘S DIRECTOR TO RETEAM WITH ZACH GALIFIANAKIS FOR DUE DATEFollowing the success of The Hangover, everyone involved with it is seeing their careers take off. In addition to The Hangover 2, which Warner Bros smartly put into development before the movie was even released, director Todd Phillips and Hangover star Zach Galifianakis are now signed to reunite on a comedy called Due Date. The comedy is about a soon-to-be father who has to race across the country with an “unlikely companion” (Galifanakis) in hopes of getting home in time to see the birth of his first child, which brings to mind elements of the classic comedy Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Due Date was written by King of the Hill writers Alan R. Cohen and Alan Freedland, with a rewrite by Adam Sztykiel (cowriter of Made of Honor). The plan is for Phillips to first make Due Date, and then move on to The Hangover 2. Additionally, Zach Galifianakis is also in talks to star in Man Witch, a fantasy comedy that Jack Black was formerly attached to (and that Phillips was also formerly going to direct), about a man who discovers he has magic abilities, which lands him a job at a school for young female witches. Another possible comedy for Galifianakis is Say Uncle, about a sportscaster who must spend the weekend taking care of three nieces and nephews. All four of these movies (Due Date, The Hangover 2, Man Witch and Say Uncle) are Warner Bros projects, which shows that the studio is wisely attempting to keep their potential new star, Zach Galifianakis, in their good graces for as long as possible.#8 GEORGE CLOONEY MIGHT BE THE NEXT JACK RYAN, PLUS TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY NEWSMilitary/espionage novel author Tom Clancy’s secret intelligence expert, Jack Ryan, has been played on the big screen now by three different actors (Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck), and now there is word that one star that may be interested in becoming the fourth is George Clooney, who following the ending of the Ocean’s Eleven series, currently doesn’t have the sort of film franchise that Jack Ryan could potentially be. Paramount is currently waiting on a new Jack Ryan script by Hossein Amini (The Wings of the Dove, Killshot) which is an original concept not based on any particular Clancy novel. There had been rumors that Paramount was looking to go with a younger Jack Ryan, but if this newest script does indeed feature a more seasoned Jack Ryan, and Clooney likes the script, maybe the long wait for the next Jack Ryan adventure will eventually be over. In other spy movie news, the British production company Working Title has hired Swedish director Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In) for their new movie version of the classic John Le Carre spy novel, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. The story is being adapted by Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost/Nixon), who is also cowriting the next James Bond movie. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, which was also adapted as a popular 1970s British TV show starring Alec Guinness, is the story of a retired British intelligence officer who is brought back to track down a double agent who is hiding somewhere within the highest ranks of the nations’s intelligence community. Filming is expected to begin in 2010, probably in the United Kingdom.#9 UNLIKELY PAIR MEL GIBSON AND JODIE FOSTER TEAM UP AGAIN FOR THE BEAVEROne of the hottest screenplays around is newcomer Kyle Killen’s The Beaver, ranking at #1 on 2008’s “Black List” of unproduced scripts. The project has now found a director and star; Jodie Foster will be behind the camera directing her Maverick costar… Mel Gibson. Previously, both Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey had been in talks for the lead role, which will now see Mel Gibson playing a depressed man who finds solace in talking to his best friend, a beaver hand puppet, ala Mr. Garrison from South Park. Mel Gibson is a rather inspired choice for the role, considering his notorious reputation for bizarre behavior following his 2006 DUI. Jodie Foster will costar as Gibson’s wife, in addition to directing, which will make The Beaver her third produced film as director, after Little Man Tate and Home for the Holidays. Filming of the $18-19 million independent production will start in New York in September.#10 JASON STATHAM TO PLAY A BIGOT COP IN BLITZJason Statham and Paddy Considine (In America) have signed on to star in Blitz, based on a crime novel by Ken Bruen. Bruen’s London Boulevard is also currently in production, starring Keira Knightley and Colin Farrell. In Blitz, Statham will play Brant, a “rather crude, un-pc, borderline sociopath of a cop,” with Considine playing his openly gay cop who works with Statham’s homophobe. Brant is on the trail of a serial killer called “The Blitz” who is killing cops all over London. Elliott Lester (Love Is the Drug) is directing from a script by Nathan Parker, who made his debut with this summer’s indie sci fi sensation, Moon. Filming starts on August 10th in London.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: DREAMWORKS TRYING TO MAKE A VIEW-MASTER MOVIEToys and board games are becoming more frequent subjects for movie projects, but they often have nearly no inherent plot or characters attached with the property, which both makes them completely open to interpretation, but also just generally odd subjects for “adaptation.” This week, DreamWorks announced big plans for one of the stranger such projects, taking on the View-Master, a classic toy that has allowed kids to see images in 3-D for nearly 70 years. DreamWorks has hired Brad Caleb Kane, writer of three episodes of FOX’s Fringe, with Alex Kurtzman and Robert Orci, the writers of Star Trek and Transformers (and cowriters of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) serving as producers. No specific plot details have been announced yet, but it’s likely that View-Master will be a 3D project, taking advantage of the current new wave of popularity for the format, and Kane revealed via Twitter that he envisions View-Master as being in the same vein as The Goonies and Young Sherlock Holmes. Perhaps Kane will come up with a great script, but View-Master gets this week’s Rotten Idea tag because it represents the trend of making movies based on concepts that don’t really lend themselves to adaptation. If Hollywood wants to “adapt” non-narrative inanimate objects as movies, why even bother with licensed concepts? Just walk around your house, pick a random item, and voila, I bet you could come up with a movie based on it. Hey, look, there’s a spork on my desk from my lunch. I can see it now… SPORK is caught between two rival factions, the forks and the spoons in a war over control of my silverware drawer, belonging to both sides, but not really truly belonging with either, in an exciting 3D animated adventure. And you don’t even need to pay anyone for the license rights to a “spork”, though Hollywood can send my check for that awesome pitch to me via Rotten Tomatoes.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"New, TV, reboot, love","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-TJ-Hooker-Film-in-Development"},{"id":"47509232194338","title":"Weekly Ketchup: X-Men: First Class characters confirmed","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: X-Men: First Class characters confirmedPlus a full slate of remakes, sequels and adaptations this week.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 17, 2009 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup has news about sequels to Nanny McPhee, remakes of Piranha and Little Shop of Horrors, a movie version of Father Knows Best and new movies for Kristen Bell, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Megan Fox.#1 X-MEN: FIRST CLASS TO STAR CYCLOPS, JEAN GREY AND BEASTX-Men franchise producer Laura Shuler-Donner clarified this week one of the big mysteries and confusions about the upcoming X-Men: First Class project, although given the title and source material, it shouldn’t have been a mystery at all. The confusion started when Variety a while back speculated that the movie would focus on the young mutants from the previous movies, like Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Iceman, etc. However, the actual X-Men: First Class comic specifically focuses on the five canon characters who were actually Charles Xavier’s first students: Cyclops, Marvel Girl (Jean Grey), Beast, Iceman and Angel. Anyway, Ms. Shuler-Donner said, “It is the first class of Xavier’s school, way back when, so it’s young Scott, young Jean, young Beast, and that’ll be really fun.” Given that we know from the many commercials that Cyclops is a character in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, it appears that X-Men: First Class could be designed to stay within in the existing franchise’s continuity, since what Laura Shuler-Donner did not say is that Angel or Iceman will be appearing in the movie (since they were retconned into being much younger in the movies). So, the question I would have now as a fan is whether X-Men: First Class will just focus on those three characters, or might other mutants be brought in as Xavier’s earliest students? Some possibilities that I might suggest are Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch (who would tie in nicely to the upcoming X-Men Origins: Magneto), Mimic (the first character added to the team after the original five) and perhaps some of the 1970s X-Men who haven’t yet appeared in the movies, like Banshee, Sunfire and Thunderbird.#2 FRANKENSTEIN, DRACULA AND FRIENDS GET THE LXG TREATMENT?Although the graphic novel it’s based on isn’t even out yet, a monster movie called I, Frankenstein is in development, setting classic monsters like Frankenstein’s Monster, Dracula, Quasimodo and the Invisible Man in a modern film-noir setting (think Sin City). I, Frankenstein (both the graphic novel and the movie) was written by Kevin Grievoux, cocreator of the Underworld franchise, and Patrick Tatopoulos (Underworld: Rise of the Lycans) is on board to direct. Ryan Turek, AKA Ryan Rotten of ShockTilYouDrop.com is producing, along with Death Ray Films, the company behind War Monkeys. In I, Frankenstein, the classic monsters are reimagined, with Frankenstein’s Monster being a private detective, Count Dracula being a criminal mastermind, and the Invisible Man being a secret agent.#3 FATHER KNOWS BEST, BUT DOES 20TH CENTURY FOX?Although it’s seemed over the last few years that the once prolific practice of Hollywood adapting old TV shows into movies had abated a bit, it looks like 20th Century Fox may not have gotten the memo, as the studio is developing a movie version of Father Knows Best, the 1954-1960 show starring Robert Young. What makes this remake seem particularly odd is that the premise doesn’t seem to be based on Father Knows Best at all, as it focuses on a father whose own father moves in with the family, and the two men’s parenting styles conflict, comedically no doubt. The problem there is that from what I remember of Father Knows Best, there was no grandfather character, and so that really wasn’t the point of the show at all. Anyway, the script is being worked on by Chad and Dara Creasey, who previously wrote episodes of Pushing Daisies and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. It’s also worth noting that the idea of a Father Knows Best has been around since the mid-1990s, when Universal hired the writers of Brokeback Mountain to work on a script (consulted by Robert Young himself), and then in 2003, Paramount and Nickelodeon were developing a movie that would have starred Tim Allen.#4 MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL JOINS THE NANNY MCPHEE FRANCHISEAlthough it’s doubtful that there are many Nanny McPhee fanboys, the 2005 Mary Poppins-ish fantasy film starring Emma Thompson actually did quite well internationally, so pre-production is underway on Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang, which moves the story ahead a hundred years (her being all magical-like) to World War II England. In addition to Emma Thompson reprising the role, Maggie Gyllenhaal will also be starring in this sequel, which focuses on the conflict between war evacuee children from the city and from the country, as their cultures and backgrounds clash, and the magical nanny no doubt steps in to settle things. Emma Thompson wrote the screenplay for this sequel, but it’s unknown who will be directing. Also, Rhys Ifans and Ralph Fiennes are rumored to be costarring as well, but that hasn’t been confirmed yet. Filming is scheduled to start in May, 2009 at Shepperton Studios in England.#5 THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF JOHN CARTER OF MARSMichael Chabon’s Pulitzer Prize-winning superhero deconstructionist novel, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, is still stuck in nearly a decade of development, but the author has found a new job: he’s been hired by Disney to work on their big budget movie version of Edgar Rice Burrough’s John Carter of Mars. Chabon actually wrote a script in 1995 called The Martian Agent, as a reaction to his lifelong desire to write something inspired by Burrough’s Barsoom saga, so this appears to be a perfect fit for all involved. John Carter of Mars will be a 2-hour, FX-filled action movie that will mark the live-action debut of Pixar director Andrew Stanton (WALL-E, Finding Nemo). As someone who grew up devouring the John Carter books (I think I read each one faster than possibly any other book at the time, I was so engrossed in his adventures), the idea of Barsoom being brought to the movies by people who “get it” has always been near the top of my cinematic wish list. At one point, Robert Rodriguez was working on a John Carter of Mars project, but Andrew Stanton’s Pixar work is top notch, so he will definitely do.#6 MEGAN FOX TURNS DRUG SMUGGLER IN THE CROSSINGA few years back, the drug smuggling drama Maria Full of Grace was a big Sundance hit, and now Megan Fox has signed to star in a similar thriller, as a woman forced to become a drug smuggler to save her husband’s life in Screen Gems’ The Crossing. Megan Fox has been lining up lots of roles lately, starring with Mickey Rourke as an angel in Passion Plays, playing the female lead in Jonah Hex, playing the Aqua-Girl lead in the comic book adaptation Fathom, starring in the Diablo Cody-written Jennifer’s Body, and of course returning for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The Crossing doesn’t yet have a director, but filming is expected to start in July, 2009. The Crossing was written by Philip de Blasi and Byron Willinger, who is also working on the movie version of Milton’s classic Paradise Lost, about Adam and Eve’s fall from grace.#7 KRISTEN BELL SAYS, YOU AGAIN?Kristen Bell, star of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and TV’s Veronica Mars and Heroes, will star in the Disney comedy You Again, about a woman who finds out her brother is engaged to the girl who made her life miserable in high school. You Again is the next project for director Andy Fickman, who is coming off two Dwayne Johnson-starring family comedies for Disney that both did quite well at the box office for the studio: The Game Plan and Race to Witch Mountain. You Again is also Kristen Bell’s second comedy for Disney, following this August’s When in Rome, costarring Josh Duhamel. It’s good to see Bell signing on for lots of comedic roles, because although her TV work wasn’t really specifically “comedic”, I’ve been really impressed by Kristen Bell’s natural comedic flair, which I think is what made Forgetting Sarah Marshall as good as it was. Filming is scheduled to start this summer, 2009.#8 ELIZABETH SHUE TO GO SWIMMING WITH PIRANHA 3-DElizabeth Shue, costar of such movies as Hollow Man and the two Back to the Future sequels, is in negotiations to star in the horror remake Piranha 3-D. Directed by Alexandre Aja (High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes remake), this is actually the second remake of the 1978 horror spoof (following a 1995 remake for Showtime), so rather than the 3 referring to a sequel, it could also be interpreted as referring to this being the third version of the original story. Shue will be starring as the small town sheriff (and mother of three) of Lake Victoria, where some nasty people-munching piranha have recently settled in. Now age 45, Elizabeth Shue has apparently firmly made that transition in her career from being “the girl” to being… “the girl’s mom”. Although Shue’s character does have a daughter, it is her teenage son, Jake, who is more central to the story, but still you get what I mean, right? Casting is underway for the various teenagers who will make up most of the fishies’ diet, and filming starts soon after.#9 CAMERON CROWE’S ROCK STAR OBSESSION CONTINUES WITH PEARL JAMAnyone who’s seen Almost Famous, or who is familiar with Cameron Crowe’s background as a young Rolling Stone music journalist (and husband of Heart’s Nancy Wilson), knows that few film directors are into the whole rock thing as Crowe. So, it’s not surprising that Cameron Crowe has been spending the last few years hanging out with Pearl Jam, in preparation for an upcoming retrospective movie that to be released in 2011 to tie in with the band’s 20th anniversary, although really that’s the anniversary of their first album Ten, since the band actually formed in 1990. Most of the big screen music movies of the last few years have been understandably gearing younger (The Jonas Brothers, Hannah Montana, etc), and Martin Scorsese’s Rolling Stones concert film Shine a Light, represented a completely different generation, so it’s sort of nice to see one of Generation X’s contributions to music being recognized by a big league director. Even if at the time, I thought Pearl Jam were a bunch of poseurs ripping off the alternative scene (I was one of those anti-Seattle backlash snobs), I’ve since come to really dig them. Time truly does heal all wounds.#10 ACTION DIRECTOR MCG TO ADAPT… A BROADWAY MUSICAL?Director McG is the sort of guy who, well, doesn’t use his real name (Joseph McGinty Nichol). He’s also associated with action movies filled with cinematic bombast, mostly because of the visuals of the two Charlie’s Angels movies, and what we will no doubt see in the upcoming Terminator: Salvation. Another type of movie, however, that McG’s flair for all things big, Big, and BIGGER might also work is… musicals? McG is in talks to adapt the Broadway musical hit Spring Awakening, which won four Tony’s, including Best Musical. Spring Awakening is a rock musical adaptation of a 1891 German play, and is set in late 19th century Germany, focusing on teenagers who are discovering their sexuality, with a plot that includes masturbation, abortion, rape and suicide. McG actually does have a background in music, having directed many videos, produced Sugar Ray’s first album and cowriting songs on their second.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS REMAKEAlthough I’m perfectly okay with the idea of Piranha 3-D, the third version of an old horror movie, a similiar project that does not pass muster is the idea of a Little Shop of Horrors remake. In this case, the objection is so much based on how awesome the 1960 Roger Corman original was, but has more to do with how perfectly Frank Oz’s 1986 musical version, starring Rick Moranis, Steve Martin and Ellen Greene, nailed the concept. The mastermind behind this remake idea is director Declan O’Brien, who has no big screen experience, but did direct the direct-to-video sequel Wrong Turn 3. O’Brien is coproducing with Roger Corman and Andrew Tennenbaum (the Bourne series), with an eye towards the remake being a “studio feature,” and says, “I have a take on it you’re not going to expect. I’m taking it in a different direction, let’s put it that way.” Here’s hoping the only direction this Little Shop of Horrors remake takes is cancellation, and the reputation of Frank Oz’s musical classic can be preserved.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.

Yet to be cast are “Howling Mad” Murdock and B.A. Baracus. The film’s director, Joe Carnahan (Narc, Smokin’ Aces) teamed up with video game voice actor Brian Bloom to “polish” the script by Skip Woods (Swordfish; cowriter of X-Men Origins: Wolverine), which was of course based upon the popular 1980s TV show about four escapees from a military prison who become a band of altruistic mercenaries. The studio hype about this movie version of The A-Team is that it is not going to be “campy” like the show, but is aiming more for a feel like the Mission: Impossible and Ocean’s Eleven movies, which seems to overlook the fact that the Ocean’s Eleven movies were, you know, sort of campy. The A-Team starts filming in August, and has a June 11th, 2010 release date.#2 CHAINSAWS, MACHETES AND NOW THE SAVAGE SWORD OF CONANMarcus Nispel, who has made a career out of remaking old slasher franchises (Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) will next work on a reboot of a different type of hack and slash anti-hero: Lionsgate and Nu Image/Millennium’s Conan. In addition to the works of the character’s creator, Robert E. Howard, Nispel (who also directed the viking movie Pathfinder) is reportedly finding inspiration for Conan from the artwork of Frank Frazetta (right) and “viscerally violent period films” like Mel Gibson’s Apocalypto. The two movies that the writing team of Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer currently have to their credit, Sahara and A Sound of Thunder, were both critical and box office flops. Can they do better with Conan? Filming is expected to start in late 2009 in Bulgaria and South Africa, so expect casting of the title character to happen soon.#3 CAMERON, SNYDER, VERBINSKI AND JACK BLACK TO TAKE THAT RIDE ON HEAVY METALTalking to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman, who is also the current owner and publisher of Heavy Metal (the magazine), Film School Rejects this week landed the scoop of four of the big, Big, BIG name directors who will be contributing segments of the upcoming $50 million third movie in the Heavy Metal franchise. For the uninitiated, Heavy Metal is an adult-themed comic book magazine that got its movie start in 1981 with a sex ‘n violence-drenched anthology of science fiction and fantasy shorts, all set to a soundtrack of classic rock and roll. First up: we already knew that David Fincher (Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) was producing and likely to direct, but Eastman reveals that another producer is none other than James freakin’ Cameron (Aliens, Terminator 2: Judgment Day), who will also direct a story. In addition to Fincher and Cameron, Eastman has also recruited Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), Gore Verbinski (the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise) and Mark Osborne (Kung Fu Panda), who will direct a comedy segment starring Jack Black (Eastman name-drops Tenacious D, so there might be a connection there). Finally, Eastman teases that there are three other directors who “have agreed, but we haven’t signed them, but they’re equally as jaw-dropping.”#4 ELI ROTH WANTS TO TRAP YOU IN HIS REMAKE OF THE FUNHOUSETalking to horror magazine Fangoria, director Eli Roth has revealed that he’s talking to Universal about plans to remake the 1981 Tobe Hooper movie The Funhouse, about a group of pot-smoking teens who are trapped in a darkride house of horrors and are stalked by a grotesque mutant killer. Roth, however, plans not so much on remaking the entire movie, but wants to build upon the film’s first half, which introduces a cast of carnival characters, and then show how the teens all get killed in creative ways by traps in the funhouse. “It should be about the kids getting killed in horrible ways, put in different contraptions in the funhouse and the final girl being strapped into the ride and sent into the tunnels to be confronted by terrifying tableaux of her dead friends. A smart remake could be so much fun. Kill the kids in fabulous ways and continually reuse the bodies by making them freaks in the freak museum, sew their eyes shut, waxworks… That’s the stuff I want to do in a remake of The Funhouse.” In the same interview, Roth also talks up another horror project, Psycho Killer, which is a slasher movie from the perspective of the maniac being written by Andrew Kevin Walker (Seven, Sleepy Hollow) and which Roth says MGM wants to release.#5 MARK MILLAR ALREADY PLANNING TO KICK MORE ASSSure, the deconstructionist teen super hero movie Kick-Ass might not even have a distributor yet, but that’s not stopping its creator, comic book writer Mark Millar (Wanted, American Jesus) from already working on… Kick-Ass 2. “Kick-Ass 2 is already being plotted out,” Millar told Sci Fi Wire. “We’re planning it, because all the actors are quite young and we have to make it relatively quickly. So we’ll definitely do that inside the next 18 to 24 months. Wanted made a fortune. It made a ton of money, and it was a property nobody had ever heard of. And I think Kick-Ass is going to be even bigger. Everybody who’s seen bits of it were rubbing their hands together with excitement because they think they’ve stumbled onto something very big.” Kick-Ass is the story of a teenage loser who is inspired by his love of comics to actually make a costume and go out fighting crime, to often disastrous results.#6 LANCE ARMSTRONG BIOPIC: RACING LIKE SEABISCUIT TO THE SCREEN?Columbia Pictures’ plans to make a biopic about bicyclist Lance Armstrong and his seven consecutive Tour de France wins are moving forward after years of development. This week we heard news that the studio has hired director and screenwriter Gary Ross (Seabiscuit, Pleasantville) to work on adapting Armstrong’s first book, It’s Not About the Bike. That book (which he co-wrote) “traces his story from his difficult Texas upbringing, his cancer diagnosis in 1996, his relationship to first wife Kristin, the birth of their child and his remarkable comeback from illness that saw him first win the Tour de France in 1999.” At one point, Jake Gyllenhaal was interested in starring as Armstrong, and spent time hanging out with Lance as research before ultimately dropping out. Now, Matt Damon is a possibility, but there is not yet any “official casting.” Coincidentally, this news of a Lance Armstrong movie comes the week after Universal greenlit the Stretch Armstrong movie. Maybe the two studios should team up and make a movie about a super flexible bike riding superhero.#7 THREE DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT ABOUT THE LIFE OF CAR MOGUL JOHN DELOREAN?Just months after the first film was announced, there are now three different biopic projects in development about the life of the late John DeLorean, the former GM executive who is credited with designing the Pontiac GTO and who later launched his own car company (which made only 9,000 cars, one of which was immortalized in the Back to the Future movies). (DeLorean was also arrested in 1982 by the F.B.I. on drug charges for which he was later found not guilty due to entrapment.) The first film is from producer David Permut (Captain Ron, Face/Off) and is actually based on the life rights to DeLorean’s attorney. Then there’s director Brett Ratner (who’s also developing a Hugh Hefner biopic), who is co-producing with Robert Evans and has hired James Toback (Bugsy, The Pick-Up Artist) to write a DeLorean script. Finally, there’s Time, Inc. and XYZ Films, which has the most legit-sounding rights to materials that include articles from both TIME and Fortune, the DeLorean biography Grand Delusions, and an unpublished autobiography by DeLorean himself. Even if none of these movies actually happen, we will get at least one DeLorean movie, however, because there is also a fourth movie — a documentary — also in the works. So, why all the sudden rush for DeLorean attention? Perhaps it’s because in the time when GM has filed for bankruptcy, the DeLorean era can be looked at fondly, as he helped usher in the era of the muscle car back when American car manufacturers dominated the industry. Ah, sweet, sweet nostalgia.#8 IS JAIME KING’S HUSBAND A BRIGITTE BARDOT FANBOY?From the not-always-reliable world of Australian newspapers comes the unconfirmed news that Kyle Newman, director of Fanboys and the upcoming War Monkeys, may also be developing a Brigitte Bardot biopic that would star his wife, Jaime King (Sin City). Now 74, Bardot is the French actress and singer who has appeared in over 80 films, including …And God Created Woman, and has also in recent years been convicted five times in France for “inciting racial hatred” for her anti-Islam statements. If the news of the project is true (and King can pull off a French accent), this is certainly one of the most interesting biopic projects I’ve heard of lately, and Jaime King does indeed look a bit like the young Brigette Bardot. A bit of trivia to consider also is that “I love Jaime” in French is… “J’aime Jaime.”#9 THE INCREDIBLE MR. LIMPET REMAKE GETS ENCHANTEDWarner Bros has been trying to remake the 1964 animated/live action hybrid The Incredible Mr. Limpet for well over a decade now, and this week the project got new life in the news that the studio has hired frequent Disney director Kevin Lima (Enchanted, 102 Dalmatians). The original Incredible Mr. Limpet starred Don Knotts as a mild-mannered schlub who is transformed into a talking fish and uses his newfound form to help the United States Navy fight Nazi U-Boat submarines. There’s no word yet as to how (or whether) the premise of this remake will be updated. In the long development process, two stars that were once in talks to star were Robin Williams, and then Jim Carrey. Like the original movie, The Incredible Mr. Limpet is expected to be a combination of live action and (CGI this time) animation.#10 MASI OKA’S BIG NERDY MMORPG MOVIE: THE DEFENDERSMasi Oka, star of NBC’s Heroes, has sold to DreamWorks a story idea called The Defenders, about a group of teenagers from around the world who are all friends in a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online… ah, you probably know the rest) video game and come together in real life for an adventure that forces them to live up to the expectations of the characters they play in the game. Oka came up with the idea for The Defenders with his friend Gary Whitta (writer of the upcoming The Book of Eli and the live-action Akira remake), who is also one of his friends in World of Warcraft. D.J. Caruso (Disturbia, Eagle Eye) is in talks to direct The Defenders, a project that’s being compared to a modern day version of The Goonies — which makes sense, in a way, given today’s video game generation (presuming one buys into stereotypes about who plays MMORPGs). Now, this would all get very interesting if Marvel decided next week that they would like to make a movie based on The Defenders, their long-running superhero team that features characters like the Incredible Hulk, the Silver Surfer, Doctor Strange and the Sub-Mariner…ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: SIMON COWELL THREATENING TO REMAKE SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER?First off, I should note that this particular story comes from the British tabloid, The Sun, which means that it might be completely bogus. That paper, for example, enjoys publishing every once in a while fake stories about Batman casting that are completely and intentionally ridiculous. However, even The Sun occasionally stumbles into real news, so I’m taking this one with that requisite bit of salt.The story this week is that British TV and music producer Simon Cowell (American Idol) is reportedly in talks to secure the rights to a remake of the iconic 1977 disco film, Saturday Night Fever, with Timbaland remixing the Bee Gee songs and Zac Efron starring as Tony Manero — the role that helped make John Travolta a movie star. Something to consider is that Efron recently dropped out of the Footloose remake, supposedly to separate his career from High School Musical stereotyping, so it seems unlikely he’d sign on for a different remake. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean it might not be true that Cowell wants Efron to star; just that it might be unlikely that Efron actually would. Anyway, although Saturday Night Fever is not a particularly great movie, it certainly doesn’t need to be remade either. Saturday Night Fever was a perfectly timed phenomenon of the disco era, and not something that needs to be revisited.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.

Although still at Universal Pictures, Jay Roach, director of the first two movies will not be returning for Little Fockers. Screenwriter John Hamburg, who frequently works with Ben Stiller (the first two Meet the… movies, Zoolander, Along Came Polly) is working on the script, which as the title suggests, will be a comedy about Gaylord Focker and his wife Pam (Ben Stiller and Teri Polo) learning to deal with their young children. Robert DeNiro and Owen Wilson are in talks to return as well, but the status of the many other past costars, like Blythe Danner, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand is currently unknown. Among the candidates to replace Jay Roach as director are Peyton Reed (The Breakup, Bring It On), David Wain (Role Models, Wet Hot American Summer) and Paul Weitz (About a Boy, American Pie). Filming is expected to start sometime later this year.#2 THE WORLD ACCORDING TO TOM CRUISEAnyone who reads this column regularly knows that Tom Cruise appears here more often than not, it seems, which means that he has aligned himself with many, many, many movies. This week, Variety ran a piece listing the many projects that are currently on Cruise’s slate. The top three contenders are listed as The Materese Circle (a spy thriller with Denzel Washington), The Tourist (an international intrigue thriller with Charlize Theron) and Motorcade, a thriller in which Tom Cruise would play a President whose motorcade is highjacked by terrorists, ala Air Force One (“Get off my… car !”). Other possibilities are Lost for Words, a romantic comedy about an actor (Cruise) who becomes involved with a romantic triangle between a Chinese director and her jealous translator; an undercover agent romantic comedy called Witchita with Cameron Diaz; Hardy Men, a comedy about the adult Hardy Boys, with Ben Stiller; and the Guillermo del Toro-produced movie version of the 1960s British superhero/spy series, The Champions. It’s interesting to note that five of these seven movies somehow involve government agents, ala Cruise’s Mission: Impossible franchise.#3 DC COMICS SIGNING UP THE COMEDIAN TO STAR IN THE LOSERSWarner Bros is doing the smart thing with one of their Watchmen stars, Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Comedian), and signing him up to star in another movie based on a comic from their DC Comics property, The Losers. Although most of the Watchmen cast are relative unknowns (except Billy Crudup), many of them are likely to see their careers take off, so it’s smart of WB to keep Morgan in house. Although The Losers was also a long-running DC Comics title set during World War II, this movie will be based on the Vertigo Comics version that re-launched in 2003, reimagining The Losers as a modern day Special Forces unit that was betrayed by their C.I.A. operative, and put on a government hit list. Morgan will play Clay, the group’s leader, and Jeremy Renner (28 Weeks Later) is also reportedly in talks for a role. Sylvain White (Stomp the Yard) is directing from a script by James Vanderbilt (Zodiac; cowriter of The Rundown), with filming expected to start later this year.#4 ZAC EFRON AND THE ROCK TO STAR IN JONNY QUEST?First off, I should note that this particular story is still in the rumor file, but I’m getting just enough truth from this one to report it here anyway, and it concerns the movie version of Jonny Quest, the 1960s adventure cartoon which very directly inspired The Venture Bros (to give younger readers an idea of what Jonny Quest was like). According to IESB, the take on Jonny Quest that Warner Bros is currently going with is to age Jonny from 11 so that 21 year old Zac Efron can star. The other actor in talks is Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as Jonny’s personal bodyguard, Race Bannon, and IESB includes an interview segment where they discuss Jonny Quest with Johnson. As noted there, Jonny Quest was one of the scripts included in the most recent version of the Black List, a survey of the best unproduced screenplays floating around in Hollywood. A 1990s version of Jonny Quest did indeed age the character to be a teenager, so the idea of casting someone as old as Zac Efron is not as strange as it might seem.#5 PRIDE, PREJUDICE, PREDATOR AND ZOMBIESThe latest example of movies with similar concepts dueling their way through development definitely covers an odd subject: mashing up Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice with monster movies. The two movies are Pride and Predator, which Elton John is both producing and writing songs for, and Pride, Prejudice and Zombies, based on an upcoming novel which is reportedly currently at the center of a studio bidding war. Pride and Predator is about alien who crashes near Netherfield Park and begins slaughtering the various 19th Century Brits, and is expected to start filming in London later this year. Despite the title, it’s likely that the alien in question won’t actually be a Predator, as in the movie franchise. Pride, Prejudice and Zombies has nearly the same concept, except it’s about Darcy and the Bennets being surrounded by brain eating zombies. It sounds like Pride and Predator has a headstart, but I think Pride, Prejudice and Zombies sounds like the more potentially hilariously awesome concept of the two mashups.#6 MARTIN LAWRENCE HEADED BACK TO AFRICAIn what sounds like the premise of Eddie Murphy’s Coming to America in reverse, Alcon Entertainment (Racing Stripes, Dude Where’s My Car?) has acquired a spec pitch from comedian Martin Lawrence called Back to Africa for him to also potentially star in. Lawrence’s pitch is about a working class guy in Queens, NY who discovers that he is the heir to the throne of an African country, and so he travels there to claim his title. No director is attached yet, and it’s unknown if Lawrence or someone else will be writing the script.#7 ROBERT RODRIGUEZ’ NEXT MOVIE TO BE A REAL NERVERACKERAlthough the world is still waiting for projects like Sin City 2, Red Sonja and The Jetsons, director Robert Rodriguez has signed with Dimension Films to make his next movie the long-in-development, Nerverackers. Rodriguez also wrote the science fiction thriller set in 2085, which is said to be in the same vein as Blade Runner. The main character, Joe Tezca, will be part of an elite police force assigned to stop a crime wave in what is supposed to a theoretically perfect society. Filming is expected to start later this year in Texas, aiming for an April 16th, 2010 release date.#8 REESE WITHERSPOON ASKS OWEN WILSON AND PAUL RUDD, HOW DO YOU KNOW?Owen Wilson and Paul Rudd are in talks with Columbia Pictures to join Reese Witherspoon in the next romantic comedy from writer/director James L. Brooks (Broadcast News, Spanglish), which is officially untitled, but has the working title of How Do You Know? Wilson and Rudd would play men competing for the heart of the same woman; Wilson as a professional baseball pitcher and Rudd as a corporate executive. Filming is expected to start in the summer of 2009. Rudd and Witherspoon recently worked together (though probably not even in the same room) as voice cast for next month’s Monsters vs Aliens.#9 WHO IS HALLE BERRY?Halle Berry has signed on to star in Who is Doris Payne?, based upon the true story of an international jewel thief whose escapades went on for over five decades. The independent production doesn’t have a director yet, but the script is being written by TV show writer Eunetta T. Boone, who’s written 10+ episodes of UPN’s One on One, as well as episodes of Living Single and The Parent ‘Hood.#10 THIS WEEK IN ASHTON KUTCHER AND FOOTBALL COMEDIESThis was a very busy week for both Ashton Kutcher and the sub-genre of football comedies. First, there is the football comedy, Traded, which is a “body switching” comedy about a NFL quarterback (Kutcher) who switches bodies with a 12-year-old geek, and learns valuable life lessons, from two of the cowriters of this summer’s alien invasion kid comedy, They Came From Upstairs. This week’s other football comedy (really more of a dramedy) is Warner Bros’ The Blindside (based on a true story and a book), which will star Sandra Bullock as a woman who takes in a homeless teenager, Michael Oher, who goes on to be one of the top NFL draft choices. Going back to Ashton Kutcher, Katherine Heigl (Grey’s Anatomy) signed on this week with Lionsgate to costar with Kutcher in Five Killers as a couple who moves into a new house only to discover that their neighbors are apparently assassins hired to kill them, making it sound like a less funny The Whole Nine Yards. Robert Luketic (21, Legally Blonde) is directing Five Killers, which is expected to start filming in March, 2009 in Atlanta and France.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message and Greg also blogs about the TV show Lost, at TwoLosties.Blogspot.com.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Awards, 2018, Diego, shows, actors, james, Skip, E!, Fox, blockbusters, cancelled, CMT, Lifetime, rt, Cosplay","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Meet-the-Little-Fockers"},{"id":"47509232206632","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Fantastic Four to Get Reboot","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Fantastic Four to Get RebootPlus more Marvel updates, including Iron Man 2, Thor and Moreby Greg Dean Schmitz | March 13, 2009 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup leads off with lots of big news for three of Marvel Comics’ biggest properties (Thor, Iron Man and Fantastic Four), followed by sequels for Taken, Hard Boiled and Journey to the Center of the Earth, a revival of a Stephen King favorite, a N.W.A. biopic and more.#1 FANTASTIC FOUR ALREADY GETTING A REMAKEIESB.net broke the exclusive news this week that 20th Century Fox, which is developing reboots of Marvel’s Daredevil and their Planet of the Apes franchise, now also has plans to reboot Fantastic Four completely from scratch. This means none of the same cast will return, and most importantly (I think) neither will director Tim Story, who arguably exaggerated the lighter aspects of the classic Marvel Comics title, so much that it became just plain goofy and basically a kids movie. Both recent movies were hits ($290 million and $330 million), but they were also critically reviled (26% and 35% on the Tomatometer), and are generally unpopular with comics fans. IESB.net says that Fox wants the new version to be “less bubble gum” and more like Iron Man. No writer or director has been hired yet. Although I am very much in favor of Fantastic Four getting a fresh start at the movies (because I’ve been a lifelong fan and didn’t see the comic I love in the movies) it’s regrettable that the reboot will apparently not be done in conjunction with Marvel Studios, and that means that the Fantastic Four won’t be able to rejoin the rest of the Marvel Universe in any upcoming Marvel productions. As for what I hope the next version of Fantastic Four is like, here are some thoughts: A) we don’t need another origin story; B) Doctor Doom can also take a break for a while; and C) the emphasis should be on the quartet having strange adventures around the world, because to me those were always the best stories (i.e. Atlantis, Wakanda, Monster Isle, Attilan and the Inhumans, etc.)#2 MARVEL CASTS TWO OF ITS MOVIES, AND DELAYS MOREThere was a good deal of casting news this week for Marvel Studios’ next two movies. First, there was confirmation of the lingering rumors regarding Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson, who will be playing Whiplash and Black Widow in Iron Man 2. Clearing up some confusion, it was revealed that the movie version of Whiplash will be based on the villain from the comics, but also incorporate elements of the Crimson Dynamo (probably mostly the Russian part). I’m totally okay with Whiplash being reimagined for the movie, because it’s hardly like he’s one of those untouchable characters; he’s actually borderline obscure to most comics fans. As for Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanov, AKA the Black Widow, that casting choice is a lot more curious, because really she looks nothing like most depictions of her, and she’ll have to pull off a sultry Russian accent. Also getting casting buzz is Thor, with word that director Kenneth Branagh had lunch recently with Alexander Skarsgard (Stellan’s son), who is best known for his work in HBO’s Generation Kill and as a viking vampire in True Blood. Standing 6′ 4″, with blonde hair, a great build, Swedish good looks and acting chops to boot, Skarsgard seems almost too good to be true for the role of the Son of Odin. For that matter, his father Stellan could even be a pretty good choice for that role of Odin. There’s also news that Branagh is looking for Thor’s brother Loki, the God of Mischief, with Josh Hartnett reportedly being his top choice. Hartnett is interested in it as a chance to prove his chops, Heath Ledger style, which is a pretty good call considering that both Loki and the Joker are villainous “prankster” archetypes. Finally, Marvel Studios also announced a revision to their schedule this week, which bumps several movies back a year. You can check that link for the specific dates, but basically Iron Man 2 is alone in 2010 now, with 2011 having Thor, The First Avenger: Captain America and (Sony’s) Spider-Man 4, and The Avengers as one of the first major movies to claim a summer, 2012 release date.#3 JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH 2: MYSTERIOUS TRAVELSNew Line Cinema, Walden Media and ContraFilm are reuniting for a sequel to the 3-D hit, Journey to the Center of the Earth. The plan is to adapt a pre-existing script entitled Mysterious Journeys: The Lost Map of Treasure Island by screenwriter Richard Outten (Pet Sematary II) as another adventure for the character played by Brendan Fraser. The concept of Mysterious Journeys centers around an island that was the inspiration for three different classic novels: Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, Mysterious Island by Jules Verne and Gulliver’s Travels by Jonathan Swift (which is also being filmed this year as a movie starring Jack Black). From that, we can gather that the movie might involve pirates, giant insects, and either really tiny people, really big people or talking horses (or all three). Eric Brevig, who made his directorial debut with Journey to the Center of the Earth, has not yet committed to return for this sequel, and neither has Brendan Fraser. Here’s hoping Mysterious Travels doesn’t also feature a smoke monster.#4 WARNER BROS BRINGING PENNYWISE THE CLOWN TO THE BIG SCREEN WITH ITHot off the success of Watchmen, Warner Bros has acquired the movie rights to another 1986 novel with a large fanbase: Stephen King’s It. Also made into a 1990 ABC mini-series starring John Ritter, Richard Thomas and Tim Curry, It is the story of a group of childhood friends from the 1950s who reunite in the 1980s when one of the members of their “Losers Club” dies, ultimately teaming up to fight a strange monster that lives in their hometown’s sewers and takes the form of a creepy clown named Pennywise. For the movie version, the decades are being bumped up a bit, so they will be kids in the 1980s (or maybe even 1990s?) and adults in the 2010s (by the time the movie gets made). Dave Kajganich, writer of the Warner Bros flop The Invasion, is working on the script. Tim Curry did an incredible job being creepy on a John Wayne Gacy scale as Pennywise, so it should be interesting to guess who might take on the role next.#5 TAKEN SEQUEL IN THE WORKS… TOOK?Although it’s buried at the bottom of the article, The Los Angeles Times broke the news this week that producer Luc Besson and frequent collaborator and screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen are already at work on a sequel to Taken, the surprise hit thriller starring Liam Neeson which has currently earned $108+ million in the U.S. No other details, such as whether Liam Neeson or director Pierre Morel would be returning, or what the premise might be about, but it’s probably a good bet that it would involve a kidnapping and someone getting very angry about it.#6 N.W.A.’S STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON: THE MOVIERappers Ice Cube and Dr. Dre have joined together with Tomica Wright, widow of Eazy-E, to produce a movie for New Line Cinema based upon their group N.W.A., which popularized gangsta rap from 1986 to 1991, despite limited radio airplay. Taking its title from their 1988 breakthrough album, Straight Outta Compton will chronicle the group’s meteoric climb to fame and controversy (best represented by the 1988 single, F*** Tha Police), their five short years together, the tumultous break up and feuds, and finally, Eazy-E’s death from AIDS complications in 1995. The trio is currently looking for a director comparable to Curtis Hanson, director of the Eminem movie 8 Mile.#7 HARD BOILED VIDEOGAME SEQUEL BECOMING A MOVIE SEQUELJohn Woo is producing a movie adaptation of the 2007 video game, John Woo Presents Stranglehold, which was billed as a sequel to Woo’s 1992 Hong Kong cop action film Hard Boiled. That would effectively make this movie both a sequel and a videogame adaptation. The game featured the likeness of Chow Yun-Fat, reprising his role as Officer Tequila Yuen. The adaptation is being written by Jeremy Passmore (the Red Dawn remake) and Andre Fabrizio, both of whom are also working on the direct-to-DVD remake of Chuck Norris’ Missing in Action.#8 A MOVIE VERSION OF CHARIOTS OF THE GODS?Paradox Entertainment, the production company behind the reboot of Robert E. Howard’s Conan, has picked up the rights to make a science fiction movie based upon the bestselling 1968 book Chariots of the Gods? by Erich von Daniken. Chariots of the Gods?, which was also adapted as a 1970 documentary feature film, claimed to present evidence from ancient cultures around the world that mankind had been visited frequently by extraterrestrials, who were then the inspiriation for the gods of the local religions. Ancient astronaut theories predate Chariots of the Gods?, but the book certainly popularized the notion, and science fiction of all forms has been informed by the concept for the 40 years since. Paradox has not yet lined up any talent for the movie version.#9 SEAN PENN IN TALKS TO JOIN A CARTELSean Penn is in talks with Universal Pictures to star in Cartel, his first action movie since 1998’s The Thin Red Line. Loosely a remake of the 1993 Italian film La Scorta, Cartel is the story of a man trying to protect his son after his wife is brutally killed by a Mexican drug cartel. Documentary filmmaker Asger Leth will make his dramatic directorial debut with Cartel, based on a script by Peter Craig, who is also working on the Cowboy Bebop movie. Latino Review is reporting that Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men) is also in talks to play a district attorney. Universal hopes to start filming this summer, but that will depend upon ongoing negotiations with Penn, who is also in talks to star as Joe Wilson in the Valerie Plame biopic Fair Game.#10 DANNY DEVITO’S MAKING A CRAZY EDDIE MOVIE? THAT’S INSANE!Danny DeVito (Death to Smoochy, The War of the Roses) is producing and will direct a biopic about electronics retail entrepeneur Eddie Antar, cofounder of the Crazy Eddie store chain, who was eventually sentenced to eight years of prison on fraud charges. Although just based in four states in the New York area, Crazy Eddie stores became famous nationwide for their commercials featuring a local DJ who yelled “Crazy Eddie, his prices are insane!”, which inspired stores of all stripes around the country to use similar commercial gimmicks. In Wisconsin, for example, we had “Crazy TV Lenny.” Peter Steinfeld (Be Cool; cowriter of 21) is working on the script.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message and Greg also blogs about the TV show Lost, at TwoLosties.Blogspot.com.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"TV, dogs","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Fantastic-Four-to-Get-Reboot"},{"id":"47509233865528","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Howard Out, Cheadle In for Iron Man 2, Plus Brad Pitt’s Odyssey in Space","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Howard Out, Cheadle In for Iron Man 2, Plus Brad Pitt's Odyssey in SpaceAlso, movie project cancellations galore! \"Goonies never say die!\"by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 17, 2008 |  CommentsShockingly, we’ve gone two weeks in a row without hearing any new remakes announced, but there are some interesting-sounding projects for a few popular and/or talented directors. This week also saw an unusually high number of ambitious titles being cancelled. Read on for the Weekly Ketchup!#1 TWO MORE POSSIBLE BRAD PITT MOVIES: THE ODYSSEY IN SPACE, MONEYBALLBrad Pitt‘s name was mentioned this week in articles about two different movie projects. First, Warner Bros. is looking to follow up on Troy with an adaptation of Homer’s The Odyssey, which takes the story to…outer space (yes, really). The epic poem about a ship of Greek war heroes on their long way home has been loosely adapted before, with O Brother, Where Art Thou? described as an Odyssey adaptation, although you have to sort of squint to see the connections. Depending upon how it’s done, I can see The Odyssey working as an outer space project, although I’d much rather have a movie more in the style of Clash of the Titans that actually handles the ancient Greek mythology rather straight forwardly. Warner Bros is hoping that George Miller (Mad Max, Babe), with whom they had been working on the Justice League movie, will direct. The other movie that Brad Pitt is being courted to star in is a Columbia Pictures adaptation of the book, Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game, about the efforts of Oakland A’s manager Billy Beane to build the perfect baseball team using computers and projections (imagine it as being a bit like creating a fantasy baseball team, only for real). David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada) is expected to direct, from a script by Steven Zaillian (Schindler’s List, American Gangster).#2 THIS WEEK IN SHOCKING (RE)CASTING NEWS: TERRENCE HOWARD OUT OF IRON MAN 2Last May’s Iron Man was a gift to fans of both comic books and superhero movies in general: a tight, humorous-when-appropriate adventure movie that managed to simultaneously be an origin story and bounce through a few other short stories as well. Iron Man was also well cast, with Terrence Howard hitting just the right notes as Tony Stark’s friend, James “Rhodey” Rhodes, a military man destined to get his own suit of armor as the weapons-packed War Machine. This week, however, brought us surprising and disappointing news, as Terrence Howard has been replaced by Don Cheadle (Boogie Nights, Hotel Rwanda) over what are being called “financial differences.” It’s pretty easy to interpret what probably happened: Howard’s agent tried to play hard ball on salary, and Marvel and Paramount called his bluff. This has got to be seen as a crushing blow to Howard, a rising star and acclaimed actor who just got his first big hit, and could have solidly followed up with this sequel, in which War Machine is expected to be a major character. A bit more perplexing is the choice to go with Don Cheadle, who is a fine actor, but does not have the physical heft and presence associated with Rhodey Rhodes and War Machine. A female friend pointed out that Cheadle’s not “sexy” like Terrence Howard, either, though I can’t attest to that. It’s not like there’s a shortage of talented black actors today… how about Blair Underwood, Mekhi Phifer, Omar Epps, Djimon Hounsou, etc.?#3 KEVIN SMITH’S BIG SPACE COMEDYDirector Kevin Smith announced this week that his next project after Zack and Miri Make a Porno and the horror movie, Red State, will be an untitled “space comedy” that is not the long talked about Ranger Danger and the Danger Rangers (seen on a t-shirt in Clerks II). The budget for this space comedy is estimated to be in the $45-50 million range, which will be Smith’s largest ever. The exact status of Ranger Danger isn’t completely known, and sifting through what Kevin Smith’s said about his upcoming projects is a bit confusing, as it’s hard to tell if what he says is about Ranger Danger, or this new outer space comedy, which is said to be a “father/son” story that references many other previous sci-fi movies (Star Wars, for sure). For example, Kevin Smith has expressed interest in working with Seth Rogen in a science fiction “superhero” comedy, but is it this one or Ranger Danger? Ranger Danger was once described as being an homage to Flash Gordon, and was expected to costar Smith’s pal Jason Mewes.#4 BRETT RATNER TAKING ON YET ANOTHER PROJECT WITH CONAN?Director Brett Ratner already has an insanely tight development slate that is only rivaled, perhaps, by Guillermo del Toro and Ridley Scott; Beverly Hills Cop 4, Rush Hour 4, Playboy, God of War and Harbinger are all reportedly top priorities. And yet, his name is being bandied around this week as the top choice for Lionsgate’s long-in-development adaptation of the Robert E. Howard barbarian fantasy, Conan, which reportedly strives to be closer to the source material than the 1980s movies starring the current governor of California. This story isn’t being run (yet) in any of the trades, but Harry Knowles’ AICN is saying Ratner’s involvement is “official,” and so it’s got to be true, right? Brett Ratner is a capable director known for working reliably and within budget, but a chief criticism of him is that he lacks a certain artistic flair. You’d be hard pressed to identify a movie as being “Ratnerian,” for example. And Conan probably would be best served by someone who brings something special to the project, I think. What thinkest thou?#5 TATTOO TO LIVE AGAIN IN MY DINNER WITH HERVEWith a title that references My Dinner with Andre, Steve Zaillian’s (American Gangster) production company (which has a first-look deal with Sony) has picked up rights to My Dinner with Herve, based upon a 1993 interview done just before the death of actor Herve Villechaize, most famous for playing Tattoo on the classic 1970s TV show, Fantasy Island. Writer-director Sacha Gervasi (cowriter of The Terminal) will be working from his own script. It sounds like the movie will tell Herve’s story in flashbacks, with that final interview providing the starting points for each. While Fantasy Island was on, Herve Villechaize was one of TV’s biggest stars, but his life after the show ended also kept him in the headlines, including incidents involving guns, violence, alcohol and a reportedly well-earned reputation as a womanizer. Villechaize was a French-Filipino “little person,” so casting him may prove quite challenging: do they cast a little person and try to make them look like Herve, or do they go for looks (and acting talent), and then shrink that person using Hollywood movie magic?#6 STEVE CARELL TO GET ALL NAPOLEONIC IN THE ADVENTURES OF BRIGADIER GERARDOh, no, yet ANOTHER comedy set during the Napoleonic Wars? Hollywood, get some original ideas! I do, of course, kid. Steve Carell has signed to star in The Adventures of Brigadier Gerard, about a brave but stupid soldier in Napoleon’s French army who is there for every step of the conqueror’s career, from his rise to his finish in exile. This is the type of comedy that Hollywood used to make much more often (Little Big Man, Love and Death, History of the World Part 1), but teen sex comedies and idiotic spoofs have since come to dominate. The production company is hoping for a spring 2009 start, from a script by John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky (cowriters of Blades of Glory), but they have to compete with a couple of other possible Carell projects like Get Smart 2 and Date Night, with Tina Fey.#7 RIDLEY SCOTT’S OTHER SCI-FI NOVEL PROJECT: THE FOREVER WARLast week, director Ridley Scott (Alien, Bladerunner, Gladiator) talked at length about his work with Leonardo DiCaprio’s production company on an adaptation of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Now this week, it’s being reported that Scott has also signed with Fox 2000 to helm a movie version of The Forever War by Joe Haldeman, which Variety says Scott had originally wanted to adapt way back in the 1980s. The Forever War is an intergalactic science fiction war story, as Earth fights an alien race called the Taurans (not the cow people from World of Warcraft), and a new race of cloned humans that is created to fight the war. This type of story is extremely common in sci-fi novels and TV shows, but there’s been a surprising lack of big screen movies with this premise (probably because movies of this scale tend to be very expensive). Ridley Scott’s always got a full schedule, and often ends up making movies that weren’t even on his previously-announced slate, but if this ever happens, it sounds like the next big space epic after James Cameron’s Avatar.#8 PETER WEIR FINDING THE WAY BACKAustralian director Peter Weir (The Truman Show, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World) has signed to work next on The Way Back, a globetrotting survival-adventure drama, with filming set to start in March of 2009 in Bulgaria. Based upon a true story, from Weir’s own script, The Way Back is about six prisoners (3 Poles, a Latvian, a Lithuanian and an American) of a Soviet gulag in Siberia who make their escape in 1940 — but that is only the beginning, as they then must make their way across Asia, which takes them through Russia, the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, the Himalayan Mountains and into Tibet and India. I’m not sure how well Bulgaria can feasibly stand in for all of those places, but maybe other locations will be used as well. Peter Weir has one of the most consistent records of quality of any director, so this is definitely an intriguing project to keep an eye on.#9 TAYLOR HACKFORD TAKING HIS POUND OF FLESH WITH MERCHANT OF SHANGHAIThe next project for director Taylor Hackford (Ray, An Officer and a Gentleman), AKA Mr. Helen Mirren, AKA Mr. Lucky Bastard, will be Merchant of Shanghai, which is not an adaptation of a Shakespeare play, but rather a biopic about one Silas Hardoon. Mr. Hardoon’s life story couldn’t be much more interesting: Jewish, but born in Baghdad, he made his way to Shanghai, China, where he worked as a debt collector before getting into real estate, cotton and the opium trade. His business dealings helped Shanghai grow into a modern city, fueled by the tens of thousands of Jews who fled there from Germany in the 1930s. Oh, and he also became a Buddhist later in life. I’m going to take a wild guess here, adding up ties to Buddhism and Taylor Hackford, and speculate that this might end up being a role for Richard Gere? Filming of Merchant of Shanghai is scheduled to start in Shanghai and surrounding areas in the fall of 2009 from a script rewrite by Timothy J. Sexton (cowriter of Children of Men).#10 A BIG WEEK IN CANCELLED MOVIE PROJECTSThis week saw an unusual amount of potential movie projects being announced or mentioned by key players as being cancelled, kaput, dead. Director Richard Donner is responsible for two, saying that both Goonies 2 and Lethal Weapon 5 are no more. Efforts are being put forward to turn The Goonies into a Broadway musical, and Lethal Weapon 5 reportedly fell apart because Mel Gibson turned it down. Director David Fincher has given up on the George C. Clarke adaptation, Rendezvous with Rama, ostensibly because its producer Morgan Freeman is in such poor health following his near-fatal car accident. Finally, there is the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe adaptation known as Grayskull, which Latino Review reports is “dead” at Warner Bros following the departure of the execs who were most vocal in shepherding the project through development. With so many projects being announced this week, but only a few movies actually in wide release each week, it stands up to reason that movies do get cancelled. We just so rarely actually hear confirmation about it.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"venice, hidden, a, Television, deadpool, Character, of, Spectrum, National","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Howard-Out-Cheadle-In-for-Iron-Man-2-Plus-Brad-Pitts-Odyssey-in-Space"},{"id":"47509235553081","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Steve Carell to Get Smart again.","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Steve Carell to Get Smart again.Plus, studio production dates for dozens of movies for 2009.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 10, 2008 |  CommentsThis week saw the announcement of a couple of sequels, some casting news/rumors for two big DC Comics titles, two new biopics and adaptations of some classic English lit. Thankfully, no remakes this week!#1 GET SMART 2: GET SMARTERFollowing the success this past summer of Get Smart, Warner Bros has both signed Steve Carell to return in a Get Smart sequel, and signed the comedian-actor to a three picture first look production deal (which doesn’t include Get Smart 2). No writer or director has been announced yet, and there’s no word yet on any returning cast besides Steve Carell, such as Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson or Anne Hathaway. Considering Johnson’s continuing love affair with kiddie movies, maybe Get Smart 2 will prove too mature and sophisticated to come back to.#2 KEVIN COSTNER IS FULL OF BULL (DURHAM)The New York Post is reporting that Kevin Costner has been in Los Angeles, talking to Bull Durham director Ron Shelton (Tin Cup, White Men Can’t Jump) about reteaming once again on Bull Durham 2, which would also see the return of Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, whose characters now own a MLB baseball team that Costner’s character Crash Davis manages. Kristen Kerr, costar of Showtime’s Dexter, is expected to costar as Crash Davis’ latest romantic interest. The idea of a Bull Durham 2 seems a bit out of left field, but if Stallone can come back with Rocky Balboa and Rambo, why not?#3 STUDIO MOVIES FILMING IN MID-2009 EXAMINEDAs negotiations continue with the Screen Actors Guild, Variety published an overview this week of the 40+ movies that the studios are aiming to start production on in the spring or summer of 2009, and there are some interesting titles. We’ve heard that most of the titles in the article were in development, but it’s an entirely different thing to actually see that a production start date has been decided upon. The movies the studios hope to start filming by next summer (see the article for the full list) include: The A-Team, Alvin and the Chipmunks 2, Beverly Hills Cop 4, Bioshock (videogame adaptation), Clash of the Titans, Footloose (starring Zac Efron), Gears of War (videogame adaptation), The Green Hornet, Iron Man 2, Jonah Hex, Mars Needs Moms (Robert Zemeckis-produced CGI), A Nightmare on Elm Street, Ramona (Beverly Cleary’s), Robocop, Sex and the City 2, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice (Fantasia spin-off starring Nicholas Cage), Thor, Tr2n and Wild Hogs 2.#4 DC COMICS MOVIES CASTING UPWith W. opening next week, Josh Brolin is already in talks to star in what is being seen as a potential franchise starter, Jonah Hex, based upon the long-running DC Comics title from the 1970s (and in other titles in the 30 years since), about a scarred former Confederate soldier turned Western bounty hunter. Jonah Hex would go on to spend his second series, published in the 1980s, in the future, but the latest script review suggests this first movie is set entirely in the 19th century. Jonah Hex is being written and will be directed by the team of Mark Neveldine Brian Taylor (Crank). That’s not the only DC casting news, however, as Latino Review is reporting that Warner Bros’ top choice to play Hal Jordan in the fast-tracked Green Lantern movie is Ryan Gosling (The Notebook). Gosling continues to show himself to be a really top notch young actor, but he doesn’t really look like Hal Jordan to me (something about his eyes, they’re too… squinty?).#5 RIDLEY SCOTT AND LEONARDO DICAPRIO’S BRAVE NEW WORLDEarlier this year, Ridley Scott made a comment that his next film after Nottingham would be an adaptation of a sci-fi novel, which led to online speculation that it might be Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Well, the trades haven’t picked up on this yet, but the talented director of Alien and Gladiator has confirmed in this interview that yes, indeed, Brave New World is his next project! Scott says that the project was brought to him by Leonardo DiCaprio’s production company, Appian Way (The Aviator, the upcoming Atari biopic), and that the director feels that DiCaprio would be “perfect for it.” Brave New World is set in a future governed by a world “utopia” where everyone does drugs and sex is purely for recreation, because the government uses “hatcheries” to create test tube babies. The script is still being worked on, so that does put a bit of a question mark about whether it will really be Scott’s next after Nottingham, but this is still very exciting news.#6 HELEN MIRREN TO STAR IN A FEMINIZED VERSION OF THE TEMPESTDirector Julie Taymor (Frida, Across the Universe) made her debut with the flamboyantly designed Shakespeare adaptation Titus, and now she’s returning to the Bard’s work with The Tempest, one of his most mysterious and mystical plays, but with a twist: the magician Prospero will now be Prospera, and played by Helen Mirren. The Tempest is set on a magical island inhabited by the sorceress and Duchess, Prospera, her daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones), her mystical servant Ariel (played by Ben Wishaw, another gender switch) and the deformed slave, Caliban (Djimon Hounsou). The story is propelled by the arrival of the passengers of the royal ship (wrecked by a storm caused by Prospera) of Prospera’s brother, King Alonso of Naples (Jeremy Irons), which include Gonzalo, a former advisor of Prospera’s (Geoffrey Rush, in talks), a butler (Alfred Monlina) and a jester (Russell Brand). The Tempest, which is scheduled to start filming in Hawaii in November to capture the appropriate island atmosphere (maybe they will bump into the Lost crew?), will be distributed by Miramax.#7 ROSE MCGOWAN TO TAKE ON DEEP THROAT STAR?Following Anna Faris’ recent departure from the project, Fox News is reporting that Rose McGowan is now in talks to star as 1970s porn star Linda Lovelace in the biopic about the actress, titled Inferno, and being produced by Brian Grazer, who also produced the Inside Deep Throat documentary. Inferno is being directed by relative newcomer Matthew Wilder (Your Name Here), with that movie’s star, Bill Pullman, reportedly costarring as Hugh Hefner and Josh Lucas playing Lovelace’s abusive first husband.#8 LOUIS ARMSTRONG BIOPIC: WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLDCharles S. Dutton announced earlier this year that he has a deal with HBO to develop a six hour mini-series about the life of famed jazz trumpeter (and singer) Louis Armstrong. So, actor/director Forest Whitaker (First Daughter, Hope Floats) has signed a deal with a French production company to direct and star in What a Wonderful World, a theatrical biopic about Armstrong, from a script by Ron Bass (Dangerous Minds, What Dreams May Come), who also cowrote Whitaker’s directorial debut, Waiting to Exhale. This will be Whitaker’s second run at portraying a jazz great, following his turn as Charlie Parker in Bird. What a Wonderful World is scheduled to start filming in the summer of 2009 in Louisiana.#9 TOM THUMB: THE NEXT BIG LITTLE THING?With Marvel prepping their Ant-Man movie for sometime in the next few years, Warner Bros. has fast-tracked a potential tentpole project based on the English folklore character Tom Thumb, with Kevin Lima (A Goofy Movie, Enchanted) directing and Red Wagon Productions (Stuart Little, Bewitched) producing. Revamping the tiny character’s origin story (which was often connected to Merlin and King Arthur), the script by Robert Rodat (The Patriot, Saving Private Ryan) is about an arrogant knight who is shrunk to 6 inches tall while assigned to protect a princess.#10 HOLLYWOOD TO MAKE ANOTHER HINDU MOVIE AFTER THE LOVE GURUGood news, Hindus, followers of the 3rd largest religion on the planet: Mike Myers did not kill all future hopes of your faith getting attention on the big screen with this summer’s atrocity, The Love Guru. The newly renamed Liquid Comics (formerly Virgin Comics) has signed a deal with producer Mark Canton (300, Land of the Dead) and Mandalay Pictures (Sleepy Hollow) to make a movie version of their comic title, Ramayan 3392 A.D., which is a futuristic sci-fi series inspired by the blue-skinned Hindu prince, Rama (an avatar of Vishnu), and his battle against the evil demon, Ravan. The comic series was created by self-help author Deepak Chopra and film director Shekhar Kapur (Elizabeth, The Golden Age), as part of Liquid/Virgin’s mission to publish comic book titles written by celebrities like directors, actors and musicians. Sony Online Entertainment is also developing a MMO video game (like World of Warcraft) based upon Ramayan 3392 A.D. John Collee (cowriter of Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World) is working on the script.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"japanese, twilight, Tomatazos, cults, Returns, critic, Company, Netflix, Opinion, Classic, Toys, King, thirty, BBC, york","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Steve-Carell-to-Get-Smart-again"},{"id":"47509235624762","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Branagh directs Thor, Seagal vs. aliens?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Branagh directs Thor, Seagal vs. aliens?Plus news about Warner Bros' Yogi Bear movieby Greg Dean Schmitz | October 3, 2008 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup sees the announcements of two movies with ties to the JFK conspiracy theories, the obligatory 1980s remake project, and lots of news for comic book projects.#1 VERILY! KENNETH BRANAGH DOTH VALIANTLY PLEDGE TO HELM YON THOR FOR THOU!If there’s one thing that always made Thor stand out as a character and a comic to me, it was his vaguely-Shakespearean way of speaking. I don’t know if Stan Lee intended it, but he basically educated generations of kids about antiquated words like “thou”, “thee” and “doth”, and it made Thor seem even more “bad ass” along the way. Thor putting his big stone hammer beatdown on some troll, yelling something like “Verily, thou will not stand!”; you just don’t get better than that in classic comics. Walt Simonson’s 1980s run was also great at that. And so, it makes a brilliant kind of perfect sense that Marvel is negotiating to put the job of directing Thor in the hands of Kenneth Branagh, who has built his reputation on his adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays. With a script full of Thor-speak, Branagh will be the guy to make sure that the actors are able to speak that way without sounding, you know, really lame. And now, I will do a little of speculating. Might Marvel also have an eye on getting Branagh to also play Thor’s human alter-ego, the meek, crippled Dr. Donald Blake? Branagh obviously doesn’t have the frame or stature to play Thor himself, but he seems like a very good choice to play Blake, but again, that’s just me guessing. Like Robert Downey, Jr., Kenneth Branagh is an actor who seems ripe for breaking out from the B list into being a major star. Branagh’s got the second star spot in Valkyrie coming next year (presuming that Tom Cruise-pirate-looking-Nazi movie doesn’t flop), and if he were to star in Thor, that might just do the trick for his career.#2 YOGI BEAR: STEPHEN COLBERT, WATCH OUT!Warner Bros has apparently given up on their Scooby-Doo film franchise, but they have another Hanna-Barbera classic cartoon in mind as their next animated/live action smash up: Yogi Bear. Although the actual 1961 Yogi Bear cartoon only ran for one season, there was a previous Yogi Bear (animated) movie in 1964, and Yogi starred in several follow-up series, usually ensemble pieces like Yogi’s Space Race (yes, a bear in space), most of which were kind of low rent, IMO. Despite not technically being a hit character, Yogi Bear is definitely a cultural icon, with phrases like “smarter than the average bear” and “pic-a-nic basket” being instantly identifiable. Yogi Bear will be a combination of CGI animation (Yogi and Boo Boo) and live action (Ranger Smith and Jellystone Park), to be directed by Ash Brannon (co-director of Surf’s Up) and written by Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia (cowriters of Surviving Christmas).#3 SCORSESE/DE NIRO PROJECT #9 ANNOUNCEDYou would be challenged to come up with a director/actor match that has produced more classic films consistently than Martin Scorsese and Robert de Niro (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, Goodfellas, etc). So, it is very good news this week that they are reteaming for #9 with I Heard You Paint Houses, an adaptation of a book about Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran, a labor organizer who claimed to have killed Jimmy Hoffa, and to have been involved in the Bay of Pigs and having knowledge about the assassination of JFK. The title is an allusion to a mobster slang of “painting houses”, referring to blood splatter on walls. The mobster tell all aspect of this movie feels a lot like Goodfellas, but with a bigger scope. Paramount is the studio behind I Heard You Paint Houses, from a script by Steven Zaillian (Schindler’s List, American Gangster).#4 JACK BLACK: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERYJack Black is reteaming with the writers of Kung Fu Panda for Universal Pictures on an untitled live-action spy spoof that is basically a take-off of the Jason Boune series. Black is to play a character who wakes up on a beach in Cuba with amnesia, so he assumes that he is really a deadly secret agent, ala the Bourne movies. The best thing about Kung Fu Panda was arguably the writing, and Jack Black has done this sort of physical comedy before (Tropic Thunder, Nacho Libre), so there might be promise here. That Universal is the studio behind the Bourne series can’t possibly be a coincidence.#5 GEORGE A. ROMERO CONTINUING HIS LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE CREEPING DEADAlthough this year’s Diary of the Dead was a certified corpse at the box office, director George A. Romero started filming this week in Ontario on an untitled project which reportedly has the production working title of Blank of the Dead (the “blank” to be filled in later, obviously). The movie is set on an island, so I’m just going to guess here that maybe the title will be Island of the Dead (regardless of the previous movies with that title). Romero wrote and is directing the movie, about the residents of a remote island whose relatives are rising from their graves, and there’s not a single person in the cast I’ve ever heard of.#6 THIS WEEK’S REMAKE: ANGEL HEARTHow could a week go by in Hollywood in 2008 without a remake of a 1980 movie being announced? This time, it’s the Mickey Rourke/Robert de Niro Southern-fried voodoo/magic-infused movie, Angel Heart, which is being produced by former New Line Cinema big shot, Michael de Luca (Blade, Boogie Nights). This is an interesting remake, because my initial reaction is “ah, come on, stop with the remakes, already!”, but then I remember my Remake Rule. Which is: remakes are okay if the original movie was flawed. And, Angel Heart, although nostalgia wants to remember only the best (Lisa Bonet sex scenes, Robert de Niro being all evil), was definitely a flawed movie. It was over long, and borderline boring/pretentious. So, I’m going to give the Angel Heart remake the benefit of the doubt, and allow that the basic concept could result in a better movie.#7 NEXT SPRING: THE SEASON OF DC?This week, three separate stories about DC Comics superhero movies all strangely touched upon the same subject: filming starts in 2009, two of which are specifically in the spring of 2009. Tying all three together, I have to wonder if this is a direct result of the recent Warner Bros/DC Comics conclave about how best to take on Marvel. Movie people in Chicago are being told to get ready for the third Christopher Nolan Batman project. Kevin Spacey is saying that he’s prepping for another Superman in 2009. And producer Donald De Line (The Italian Job) says Green Lantern is being fast-tracked for a spring, 2009 production start. Of those, the most exciting news is the Green Lantern greenlight, because that is a character with a lot of big screen promise. The most interesting is the Kevin Spacey news, because it runs a bit counter to things we’ve heard, such as the possibility of a post-Singer reboot that probably wouldn’t include Spacey as Lex Luthor. All three are huge titles, and if they all really did film in 2009, would give Warner Bros (which also has some Harry Potter movies) probably the largest 2010/2011 schedule, even bigger than Paramount’s Marvel slate of Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America and The Avengers (which was confirmed this week as going to that studio).#8 UNDER SIEGE 3: IS THAT AN ALIEN IN MY SOUP?The slow creeping doom of age and impending death is closing in on Steven Seagal, age 57, and so he is trying to get Hollywood to pony up some cash to make Under Siege 3. But oh, being a surprisingly limber chef on a train or a boat won’t be enough time around. Talking to MTV, Seagal says he wants Under Siege 3 to be “more mystical, or maybe extraterrestial in nature.” That’s right, Seagal wants to beat up aliens. MTV speculates that he means something like Under Siege in Space, but I think it probably be more like he’s a chef on a boat, and then it turns out there’s aliens on the boat. Personally, I think what Seagal should do with Under Siege 3 is just have his chef working at a restaurant, and he’s constantly thinking there’s bad guys attacking, but it’s really just, you know, the shrimp delivery guy. That could be comedy gold.#9 300 SEQUEL DETAILS REVEALED: 300 BOATS?Talking to IESB.net, director Zack Snyder (Watchmen) gave us our first insight into what the planned 300 sequel will be about: the year of Spartan battles inbetween the Battle of Thermopylae depicted in 300, and the Battle of Plataea, from which the film’s narrator was seen in the flash forwards. What Snyder and Warner Bros have to wait for, for more details, is for Frank Miller to actually write the graphic novel sequel to 300, for them to adapt. So, what happened in that year? From what I can tell, the biggest event was a month later, in the naval Battle of Salamis, which involved fleets from dozens of Greek cities, just one of which (and not one of the larger) was from Sparta. So, will Miller’s new book focus on sea battles more than naked dudes with shields?#10 JFK Part Deux?Producer John Davis (The Firm, I, Robot), through his deal with 20th Century Fox, has procured the rights to an upcoming expose book called Good Night, Dorothy Kilgallen, about a journalist, Dorothy Kilgallen, who died mysteriously in 1965 following her attempts to investigate the conspiracy theories about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, who was also a personal friend of Kilgallen. It’s been a long time now since movies like JFK and Ruby delved into the same subject matter, and people are still fascinated with the subject.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"cats, jamie, Holidays, elm, Tarantino, satire, Academy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Branagh-directs-Thor-Seagal-vs-aliens"},{"id":"47509235703618","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Pitt to be a Bastard, Riggs &amp; Murtaugh returning?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Pitt to be a Bastard, Riggs &amp; Murtaugh returning?Plus casting news for Natalie Portman and Julia Robertsby Greg Dean Schmitz | August 8, 2008 |  CommentsHey gang, welcome to another Weekly Ketchup. This week’s word is “obligatory.” How many times can you spot it?#1 QUENTIN TARANTINO RECRUITS THE FIRST OF HIS INGLORIOUS BASTARDSThis was a big week for the casting of Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Bastards (AKA Inglorious Basterds, which is how the script spells it), with nearly every day bringing a new name, but the biggest is Brad Pitt, who will be playing the goy soldier who brings the ragtag bunch of Jewish troops together for their special mission. So far, three names have surfaced to play those soldiers: Cabin Fever director Eli Roth, Numb3rs star David Krumholtz and from The Office, B.J. Novak. It appears that Tarantino’s initial plans of making this an all-star affair were scrapped, and further evidence of this was the revelation that QT is looking to cast a German actor to play the main Nazi baddie instead of the rumored Leonardo DiCaprio. Also in talks to star are Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) as a British officer and 1980s hottie Natassja Kinski (Cat People) as one of Germany’s most famous actresses, who represents the obligatory “hey, remember them?” portion of a typical QT movie’s cast (see also: Darryl Hannah, Michael Parks, Pam Grier, Jeff Fahey, etc).#2 BELIEVE ME, YOU REALLY ARE GETTING TOO OLD FOR THIS SH*TWhen Lethal Weapon 4 failed to do the same sort of blockbuster business that the first three movies did, producer Joel Silver and the two stars (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover) were quoted by various sources as saying that the franchise was pretty much done. No Lethal Weapon 5. Forget it, nuh-uh. Right, well, that was ten years ago, and Mel Gibson’s star is not as glittering as it once was, so… Lethal Weapon creator, screenwriter Shane Black (Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang) has taken two old scripts, merged them together to form one new Lethal Weapon script, and producer Joel Silver, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are apparently all excited about doing it. The plot this time around would involve nearly-retired Riggs getting his old partner Murtaugh to come out of retirement for… just… one… more… case. The funny thing is that at the rate Hollywood is going remake crazy these days, yet another sequel to a tired, basically dead franchise actually feels refreshing (in comparison) somehow. Speaking of that…#3 2008’S OBLIGATORY GOONIES 2 RUMORWe’re almost two thirds through another year, and we haven’t had any decent Goonies 2 rumor mongering going on. Gasp! Rumors of a Goonies sequel are to the Internet what swallows are to Capistrano. A year cannot pass without their return. And so, here’s your link to AICN . Warner Bros is interested, yada yada yada. In a sort of sick, evil way, I hope they end up going with a godawful CGI “Sloth” monster so that all the Generation X fanboys who have been clamoring for this will end up feeling cheated and betrayed. A theatrical Goonies sequel is just a bad, bad idea IMO.#4 SHOULDN’T A THEATRICAL 24 MOVIE BE CALLED JUST 2?The producers of TV’s 24 are currently making a DVD movie in South Africa called 24: Exile, and apparently the 20th Century Fox execs are impressed enough that their “enthusiasm” for making a feature film version of 24 is being stoked. Now, when such a movie would be made is up for debate: probably not until after the show wraps, but the scheduling of the series is such that perhaps it could happen next year. My hunch as to what else is making Fox “enthusiastic” about a 24 movie? That the X-Files feature film franchise appears to be pretty much dead (regardless of what Chris Carter hopes), and so Fox is looking for another TV show to take its feature film place. Again, just a hunch.#5 THIS WEEK’S OBLIGATORY HORROR REMAKE IS: SUSPIRIAThe concept of a remake of Suspiria, the creepy Dario Argento horror flick about a coven of witches living (and killing) in an European ballet school, has been known of for a while, but Bloody Disgusting got the news this week that Natalie Portman is apparently interested in producing and starring, with David Gordon Green (Undertow, Pineapple Express) the top choice to direct. Now, I normally DESPISE the current trend of remakes, but like Darren Aronofsky’s Robocop, this is sounding like a remake that might actually turn out to… you know, not be a travesty.#6 V: THE SERIES: THE MOVIE?I don’t know if this will ever actually happen as a theatrical movie, but Kenneth Johnson, the creator of the 1980s sci-fi TV series, V: The Series, has taken the time to write up a script for a theatrical remake of the original two-part mini-series (which then inspired the TV series as a spin off), and Latino Review took the time to do a review. The concept of the show was actually pretty great: evil lizard people come to earth in disguise, conning the human race into thinking they’re our friends, so they can systematically take over the planet and start eating us. It would probably, however, be better served by getting the sort of treatment that Battlestar Galactica got, as a new TV series. As a two hour movie, might this not just feel like a remake of John Carpenter’s They Live? That reminds me, I’m out of gum.#7 THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND, THIS MOVIE IS YOUR MOVIE…Mimi Leder, a director who once directed such big budget extravaganzas as Deep Impact and The Peacemaker, has not been getting as high profile work as lately, as CHUD reminds us. To go with her new lower profile, she is lining up a project that seems like it might be rather intriguing, which is Remember Their Names, about the time that folk singer Woody Guthrie spent as a merchant marine during World War II.#8 JACKIE CHAN TO BASICALLY REMAKE ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTINGOh, Jackie Chan, must it come to this? You were Drunken Master. You were the star of more Police Story movies than I can count off hand. You were, basically, the “new Bruce Lee.” And now, you’re a little bit older, and you’re doing… The Spy Next Door, a kids movie about a babysitter who has to fight off secret agents when one of the kids downloads super secret software. Directed by Brian Levant (the two Flintstones movies), this movie will undoubtedly cement Chan’s descent into becoming a cartoon of his former ass-kicking self. Admittedly, this is a path he’s been on for a while, but that still doesn’t make it, you know… right.#9 THIS WEEK IN GRAPHIC NOVEL ADAPTATIONSDisney has picked up rights to Monster Attack Network, yet another graphic novel that I’ve never heard of, with plans to make it into a Men in Black type sci-fi action comedy, about the team that’s called in when the giant monsters living on an island (full of giant monsters) get out of hand. If Will Smith signs on, is it okay if I don’t report it?#10 OH PLEASE, LET THIS MOVIE GET MADE WITH THAT TITLE INTACTWarner Bros has picked up rights to the book, Drink Play F**k, which is apparently the male answer (although officially unrelated) to a previous book, with more of a female angle, called Eat Pray Love, which Paramount has picked up the rights to, with Julia Roberts expected to star. I’ve got no interest in the Julia Roberts movie, but the Warner Bros movie, whatever it’s actually about, has sort of got me sold just on the title alone. Yes, I can be that immature.You can contact Greg Dean Schmitz via a message at the RT Forums, the thread there devoted to him, or his MySpace page.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Election, TV, Spectrum, watch","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Pitt-to-be-a-Bastard-Riggs-and-Murtaugh-returning"},{"id":"47509237230419","title":"Weekly Ketchup: The A-Team Gets a Release Date, Plus Pics from G.I.

Joe!Plus rumors that Clint Eastwood may return as Dirty Harryby Greg Dean Schmitz | March 23, 2008 |  Comments20TH CENTURY FOX LOVES IT WHEN A PLAN COMES TOGETHERLong in development, the A-Team movie’s imminent production got a bit of a backdoor announcement this week in the form of 20th Century Fox adding the title to its release calendar, aiming for a summer date of June 12th, 2009. The adaptation of the 1980s adventure TV series about a foursome of Vietnam vets on the run who travel around helping people as classifieds-advertising vigilantes has for years been the subject of thousands of “dream casting” type web sites and posts. If someone is beefy, famous and and black, then someone else somewhere has suggested they’d be perfect to play B.A. Barracus. The same goes for wacky comedian types and Murdock. Regardless, no official casting has been announced yet. What we do know, however, is that the current director is John Singleton (Shaft, 2 Fast 2 Furious) and the script will be by his writing team (Michael Brandt and Derek Haas) from 2 Fast 2 Furious (and also, 3:10 to Yuma). So, join the fun… who do *you* think would be best for each of the show’s iconic characters?SNAKE-EYES: ALMOST AS LIFELIKE AS THE ACTION FIGUREAin’t It Cool News, by way of USA Today and G.I. Joe comics writer Larry Hama, was the source this week for our first glimpse of Ray “Darth Maul” Park in costume as Snake-Eyes in the G.I. Joe movie. I’m just a bit too old to have been a fan of the toys or the cartoon (my G.I. Joes were about 3 times bigger and vaguely resembled a bearded Lee Majors), but I do know what Snake-Eyes looks like, and… I believe that is it. Going a bit off-subject, looking at this picture of a completely costumed guy wielding a sword and sometimes a gun, I got to wondering how they will handle Deadpool (played by Ryan Reynolds) in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, who has a similar look (but with a lot more red). Snake-Eyes is mute, so they can easily get away with a look that is basically faceless, but Deadpool is actually quite gabby. Unless they want Deadpool’s scenes to come off like those Spidey/Green Goblin scenes in that first movie, I’m guessing then we won’t get as faithful a look as what the G.I. Joe costume designers did with Snake-Eyes.JACK RYAN: BALDWIN, FORD, AFFLECK AND NEXT…?Paramount Pictures announced plans this week to revive military/adventure author Tom Clancy‘s character of Jack Ryan’s career as a movie character, following the four movies in which he has been played by Alec Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October), Harrison Ford (Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger) and Ben Affleck (The Sum of All Fears). What’s probably most interesting, however, is that the director they are in talks to bring Clancy’s C.I.A. consultant back is Sam Raimi (Spider-Man series, Evil Dead series). Reportedly, the decision hasn’t yet been made about whether the next film would be an adaptation of one of Clancy’s books, or just an entirely new story, which means that there’s no script (or writer) yet, but even so, Paramount wants to get the movie done and ready for release in the summer of 2010. Raimi’s currently working on his return to horror, Drag Me to Hell, and when you fit the development and production of a big budget spy/military thriller in there, that doesn’t allow much time for a lot of Raimi’s other projects, like say, the possibility of a Spider-Man 4 (though I sort of didn’t think he’d be returning for that one either).GO AHEAD, PUNK, MAKE THIS MOVIEWith another movie he’s directed already in the can and scheduled for this November (The Changeling, a thriller starring Angelina Jolie), Clint Eastwood is wasting no time or worrying about competing with himself, signing with Warner Bros to direct and star in a project called Gran Torino that has really set the Internet buzz wagons afire. Where this gets *really* interesting is the scoop/rumor that Ain’t it Cool News is running with, which suggests that the lead character of Gran Torino is none other than one Harry Callahan, AKA Dirty Harry, which would make it the “Dirty Harry 6” many people probably gave up on ever thinking we’d ever actually see get made. If AICN’s source is right, the story involves Dirty Harry coming out of retirement when his son, also a cop, is killed by a killer whose only known trait is the 1972 Ford Torino he drives (which as AICN concurs, was a very cool late model from the last days of the classic street muscle car). Anyway, the secrecy about the plot in the Variety article makes me think that AICN is probably right, and that makes me a happy camper, because as a kid in the 1970s and early 1980s, the five Dirty Harry movies were one of the signatures of “cool.” Yeah, Harry Callahan was a violent and arguably morally blackish-grey guy, but he was still, you know, awesome.JONAH HEX AND THE CRANK TRILOGYNever really a comic book superstar, Jonah Hex was still one of DC Comics’ most consistent titles for over a dozen years, telling the story of a “bad ass” cowboy in the style of Clint Eastwood’s cowboy movies. This week, two separate pieces were published online about the planned movie adaptation of the series, in the form of a script review and an interview with Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the writers/directors of the Jason Statham film, Crank, and Hex. The interview was done in conjunction with the release of Pathology (which they wrote but didn’t direct), and brings the news that they have plans for two more Crank movies, in a schedule that sounds like their next movies would be Crank 2, then Jonah Hex, and then Crank 3. Now, I wonder what Jason Statham would look like with his face half scarred, in a nasty old Confederate uniform, and six guns in his hand?PUTTING THE SPICE BACK INTO DUNEPeter Berg, whose career as a director has been quite varied (The Rundown, Friday Night Lights, this summer’s Will Smith superhero movie, Hancock), has attached himself to lots of projects over the years, but this week brought confirmation of a remake/adaptation project that could arguably be his most ambitious yet: Dune. Written in the 1960s by Frank Herbert, starting off what would become one of the most popular science fiction “space opera” novel series ever, Dune is the epic tale of a struggle on the desert planet Arrakis, home to giant worms, a drug-like substance called “The Spice” (which also grants super powers of a sort), and not much water. David Lynch made a big budget movie of Dune in 1984, which I personally *love*, but the sentiment was not universal, and the movie is still considered a flop by most. So, that actually makes Dune a good candidate for being re-done, as most people would probably consider the chances of getting a “better” movie on the upside. Paramount Pictures no doubt sees this not only as a “tentpole” project, but potentially the first of many films, with plenty of books by Frank Herbert (and his son, Brian) yet to adapt.SHAKING THE REST OF THE KETCHUP OUT OF THIS WEEK’S BOTTLEGeorge Lucas talked quite a bit this week to the guys over at ComingSoon.net, which gives us the news that he might start filming Red Tails, his project about the Tuskegee Airmen, later this year, for a 2009 release. His 2008 release, Star Wars: The Clone Wars also gets a lot of attention in an interview there.The title character of the TinTin trilogy to be directed by Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson and either another director or one of those two, has been cast in the form of 17-year-old British actor Thomas Sangster, who is possibly best known for playing Liam Neeson‘s young son in Love, Actually.The voice cast for the DreamWorks 3D CGI fantasy comedy, How to Train Your Dragon has been announced, and it includes Gerard Butler (300), America Ferrara (Ugly Betty) and Jonah Hill (Superbad). The story of a scrawny kid in a Viking village who must capture and train a dragon, is scheduled for a release on March 26th… 2010.The first two really great official images of Benicio del Toro in full-on Wolfman makeup appeared online this week, via “Entertainment Weekly.” Makeup guru Rick Baker has done an *amazing* job, both of creating a terrifying creature, but at the same time keeping true to the classic features of the original 1930s/1940s Wolfman makeup.The first on-location images of Johnny Depp as mobster John Dillinger in Michael Mann’s Public Enemies are now online. Depp appears to be enjoying hanging out in Columbus, Wisconsin, which is just one of a few different Dairy State towns he’ll be visiting in coming weeks, in a rare situation where a place like Wisconsin plays itself, instead of, you know, being filmed in… Canada.Robert Downey, Jr. goes where few other actors could dare (and whether *he* can is still up for debate) in the fairly funny/awesome trailer for Tropic Thunder.Mad Max series director George Miller (who’s currently working on the Justice League America movie) revealed quite a bit of details about Fury Road, the (not made yet) fourth Mad Max movie, which sounds like it may not get made, and if it does, it probably won’t be with Mel Gibson (though it would have, at one time).Similarly, based on what Chris “Human Torch” Evans is saying, it sounds like 20th Century Fox may have changed its collective studio mind about making a third Fantastic Four movie, as he’s not heard anything on the subject in the year since the second movie’s release.Director Matthew Vaughn, who’s attached to adapt Marvel’s Thor, may actually direct another comic adaptation, Kick Ass (which is still not completely published yet) first, according to a scoop over at AICN.Greg Dean Schmitz can be contacted via his MySpace page, there’s a RT Forums thread devoted to him, and his IMDb discussion thread is currently a very lonely place.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Action, YouTube, criterion, harry, VICE, nature, obituary, Paramount, action, Reality, football, vampires, doctor, composers","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-The-ATeam-Gets-a-Release-Date-Plus-Pics-from-GI-Joe"},{"id":"47509237224271","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Toy Story 3 , Cars 2, &amp; more from Pixar","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Toy Story 3 , Cars 2, &amp; more from PixarPlus more casting in Oliver Stone's George Bush biopic.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 11, 2008 |  CommentsTHE FUTURE OF PIXAR“Quint” from Ain’t it Cool News attended a recent big publicity event hosted by Pixar and Disney Animation, and so they’ve posted a very nice summary of what Pixar has planned for the next four years or so. The piece starts with their next two, Wall-E and Up, but the movie fandom at large has been fairly aware of those two, so I’ll concentrate on what was “newer” news in the piece. For 2011, Pixar is working on Newt (Summer, 2011) and The Bear and the Bow (December, 2011). Newt is a romantic comedy about two newts (the moist four legged amphibians often confused with salamanders) that are the last of their species, one male and one female. The male has spent his life in captivity awaiting company, while the female is a fierce adventurer from the wild, and when put together, they don’t quite hit it off (partly because the male’s view of a diagram explaining newt mating patterns is blocked by a coffee machine). At first glance, it sounds a little bit like a more land-based Finding Nemo with a romantic angle, but Pixar does animated animal comedy like on one else, so it’ll probably be all awesome and stuff. The Bear and the Bow is a fairy tale in the style of the Brothers Grimm, from one of the writer/directors of The Prince of Egypt, and it tells the story of a Scottish royal family and their involvement with a witch. The project already has its core cast, which includes Julie Walters as the witch, Billy Connolly (an awesome voice actor) as the king, Emma Thompson as the queen and Reese Witherspoon as their heroic archer princess of a daughter. Whereas Newt is sort of old hat territory for Pixar, this one is sort of exciting because Pixar has never really gone into fantasy territory like this before.Finally, there is news of plans for a Cars 2 (aiming for the summer of 2012), which will take the automobile antics overseas, and plans for the first Toy Story movies to be re-released in digital 3-D, leading up to the release of Toy Story 3 (on 10/2/09, 2/12/10 and 6/18/10 respectively). The press conference also included Disney Animation projects, most of which were already known about, but the new title, revealed as a Christmas, 2012 release is King of the Elves. King of the Elves is based on a Phillip K. Dick (Blade Runner) short story about a man in Mississippi whose assistance to a group of elves living there leads them to proclaim him their king, which leads him to fighting off an evil troll that threatens the elves.THE LAWS OF ROBOT MOVIESProduction has started in New Orleans on Robosapien: Rebooted, a movie adaptation of the little white robot toy you’ve probably seen in toy stores, directed by Sean McNamara, “hot” off another toy adaptation, Bratz: The Movie. Hollywood movies have long been a very expensive way of promoting toys (thank George Lucas and Star Wars for that), and now the concept is apparently just being accepted (by financiers) as not needing any contrivance. The movie can be a direct adaptation of the toy (like, say G.I. Joe and Transformers) and people are apparently okay with that. So, I guess, I should be. And yet, it still feels crass to me. Ah well, I’m also not one of the kids who these movies are marked towards. I also can’t help but notice that this project is being revealed just a week after Dimension announced their remake plans for Short Circuit, and both of *these* movies seem a lot like Pixar’s Wall-E (especially Short Circuit, but this one as well). It feels like Hollywood types are seeing that Wall-E will be a huge hit, and they are getting their Wall-E-ish projects in quick order to ride the robotic wave. So, by that logic, expect Marvel Comics to announce a H.E.R.B.I.E. movie next?DUBYA’S INNER CIRCLE EXPANDSCasting continued this week on Oliver Stone’s W, about the rise and political success of George W. Bush, with Rob Corddry (The Daily Show) landing the role of press secretary Ari Fleischer, Fantastic Four star Ioan Gruffudd to play Tony Blair and Thandie Newton signing on to play (the much older) Condoleeza Rice. Yet to be cast are some of the biggest names, including Karl Rove, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney (despite early word that Robert DuVall had been approached). These casting announcements are sort of overshadowed, however, by the publication online of actual pages from the script, which paint a very specific picture of the approach that Stone is taking with this project. Read them yourself, a review of the entire script at Slate.com or see what some experts think.HOW TO BE CYNICAL ABOUT LOVE BY 30This week saw two different studios pick up movie rights to articles about love and relationships, which I always find kind of odd. But, I guess it worked for Sex and the City (which was also a book, I know), so maybe that’s where they’re coming from. How to Get Divorced by 30, picked up by Universal from an article in L.A. Weekly, suggests that it’s best to get your first marriage out of the way early so you can find love the second time around. How modern. Tobey Maguire and Warner Independent have likewise picked up the rights to Marry Him! Finding Mr. Real, an article which is becoming a book (changing the subtitle to Mr. Good Enough), which encourages women to drop their standards low. So, basically, it’s going to be a feature-length version of that old MAD TV sketch, Lowered Expectations? Changing the subject a bit, but still related to Maguire, Endgame Entertainment this week picked up rights to a thriller script called Hungry Rabbit Jumps, for Maguire to star in, which they are saying is similar to David Fincher’s The Game, starring Michael Douglas.MORE LIKE THE PRINCE OF PEORIADisney’s live-action adaptation of the Prince of Persia video game series was the focus of a good deal of casting buzz this week, starting with the (quickly debunked) rumor that the Prince might be played by Orlando Bloom, followed by Latino Review’s story that the role might instead now be offered instead to Jake Gyllenhaal. Never mind, I guess, that he isn’t you know… Persian, or even Middle Eastern. He’s got dark hair though, which I guess Disney figures is close enough.On the next page: the rest of the “Ketchup”…SHAKING THE REST OF THE KETCHUP OUT OF THIS WEEK’S BOTTLEThe trailer for the ensemble drama (Charlize Theron, Ray Liotta, Woody Harrelson, Michelle Rodriguez), Battle for Seattle, telling the stories of people from all sides of the 1999 World Trade Organizatin riots in Seattle, is now online.Apparently inspired by the success of Cloverfield, Columbia Pictures and producer Neil Moritz (XXX, I Am Legend) have picked up the script, Battle: Los Angeles, about a platoon of Marines fighting off an alien invasion in the streets of Los Angeles and Santa Monica, with plans to fast track the project in time to start filming in the next six months.MGM has acquired the rights to Bobism, a comedy about a teenager who discovers that his blog is the basis for a utopian socity 1,000 years in the future.Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway will costar in Bride Wars, about two friends who both pick the same wedding date, with Candice Bergen playing a famous wedding planner, and Gary Winick (13 Going on 30, Pieces of April) directing.The independent comedy, Divorce Ranch, will star Chloe Sevigny as a World War II-era actress who moves to a ranch in Nevada (along with her assistant, played by Zooey Deschanel) in the hopes of securing a quickie divorce.The CGI animated version of Gatchaman has apparently hit a bump, as its director, Kevin Munroe (who did TMNT for the same company) has dropped out, so that he can work on an adaptation of the graphic novel, Dylan Dog, instead. Dylan Dog is an Italian series that sort of does for a “traditional” monster hunter what Constantine did for a hunter of more demonic origins. I haven’t read it but Dylan Dog also appears to take more of a surreal/humorous approach.With no other information known about it other than it being a “sci fi epic”, Universal won a bidding war against three studios for the rights to produce Earth vs Moon, from the creators of The Joe Schmoe Show, that fake reality show from a few years back about a guy who didn’t realize the show was fake. The best guess I can come up with is that maybe this movie will likewise deal with subterfuge, and be a sort of Wag the Dog, but with (fake/staged) attackers from the Moon instead. Again, please note, just a guess.Jane Austen’s Emma, which was also the inspiration for Clueless, has been targeted by Screen Gems (Sony) and one of the screenwriters of Menace 2 Society, as the basis for a hip hop musical called Emme, which is expected to have at least 15 song and dance numbers.After doing two documentaries about Iraq, famed filmmaker Errol Morris is returning to more eccentric subject material (like the guys featured in his Fast, Cheap and Out of Control) with The End of Everything, which will reportedly include coverage of flightless birds, a volcano, the author of Gone with the Wind and Laura Bush.ThinkFilm has acquired U.S. rights to The Escapist, a British prison drama starring Brian Cox and Joseph Fiennes, that premiered in January at Sundance.Robert de Niro, Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell are headlining Everybody’s Fine, an English-language remake of the 1990 Italian film of the same (English) title, about a widower (de Niro) who goes on a road trip after his wife’s death to reconnect with his three children, only to discover that their adult lives are really screwed up. The remake was written and will be directed by Kirk Jones, whose first film was the very funny and touching Waking Ned Devine.Walt Disney Pictures has picked up rights to a comedy script called Family Dude, about a successful executive who hires a family to pose as his own while he meets with clients at a cowboy ranch in Montana, in a story that in no way resembles City Slickers. The producer is Walt Becker, who directed Wild Hogs, and is currently filming its sequel, Old Dogs, starring John Travolta, Bernie Mac and Robin Williams.The trailer for horror master Dario Argento’s next film, The Mother of Tears, starring his daughter Asia Argento (and Udo Kier!), is now online, just as the news has come out of his next project, Giallo, which will star Adrien Brody as an Italian investigator who teams up with a flight attendant who fears that her sister has been abducted by a serial killer named Yellow (which Giallo is Italian for).Rogue Pictures has recruited hot genre screenwriter Justin Marks (Voltron, Masters of the Universe and Supermax, starring DC Comics’ Green Arrow) to adapt Hack/Slash, a comic book series (and series of one-shots and mini’s) about Cassie Hack, a seductively dressed woman who travels the country, killing serial killers and other such bad guys. Todd Lincoln, who worked on the special effects for From Dusk Til Dawn will be making his directorial debut.Even though High School Musical 3 won’t be hitting theaters until this fall, Disney is already working on plans for High School Musical 4, which may see the series return to the small screen (like the first two), and will probably not feature all of the returning cast. If #3 is a huge, super hit like many expect, however, expect that some of the variables mentioned in that article to possibly change.Jim Carrey, Ewan MacGregor and Leslie Mann are signed on to star in I Love You, Phillip Morris, about a prison inmate (Carrey) who falls in love with the prisoner in the cell next to him. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the writing team behind Bad Santa and Cats &amp; Dogs, will be making their directorial debuts on this comedy.Two clips of Iron Man appeared online this week, at SciFi.com and Apple.com.The giant shark movie, Meg, which has been struggling through film development for over a decade now, appears to have gotten a new chance at actually getting made, according to an article in the L.A.

With several different human character having worn the Green Lantern ring since the characters 1940s roots, what and who exactly Green Lantern is depends upon the individual fan, and what their exposure has been. For kids who mostly know the recent Justice League cartoons, it might be John Stewart (being played by rapper Common in the JLA movie, a separate project). The classic hero, I think, however is pilot Hal Jordan, and from what I’ve heard, that is who Berlanti is focusing on for this movie. Hal Jordan’s tenure as Green Lantern is the longest, and with a later career as a destructive villain, the darkest and most interesting character arc that could be played out over a few movies, potentially. Berlanti sounds like he really loves the Green Lantern property, so I’m excited to see what he comes up with.HEAVY METAL IIIDirector extraordinaire David Fincher is teaming up with Paramount Pictures to develop a third animated Heavy Metal anthology project, which will feature the contributions of eight or nine of today’s most visually creative directors (we hope), including one directed by Fincher himself. For the unitiated, Heavy Metal is a fantasy/sci-fi magazine that is mostly a showcase of European artists who specialize in the bizarre, erotic and visually bold. Its popularity peaked in the 1970s and 1980s (but it’s still going), and inspired two previous animated anthology movies, a fairly high profile 1980 release, and a less well known 2000 movie. This is exactly the sort of project that I honestly wouldn’t have predicted (since the 2000 edition came and went with so little notice, but with someone like David Fincher involved, all of a sudden, it seems like such an obviously potentially awesome project. Woo. Of course, David Fincher is also the kind of creative person who seems to attach himself to a lot of stuff over the years. This one, though, being an animated short, probably does have a chance of him getting it done sooner than say, any one of his other 11 or 12 projects in development. Fincher’s next live-action film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, starring Brad Pitt, will be released late this year.REMAKES! THEY’RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER… BABY, YOU’LL REMEMBER THEIR NAMESMGM announced this week that they’ve hired a 23-year-old MTV dance choreographer, Kevin Tancharoen, to direct a feature film remake of Fame, that 1980 chestnut about the lives of students at a New York performing arts high school. Gosh, a “high school musical”, what an original concept for the early 21st century youth market! Someone like Disney should get right on this… maybe do a couple of made-for-TV projects first, and then make a third movie for a theatrical release. Anyway, there’s no word yet about whether the remake will be literal enough to actually include the original movie’s songs, if there will be all new music, or really, how much singing there will be (the dancing is a given, though).MGM isn’t stopping there, however. AICN found a press release today that includes references to other film franchises that the studio is planning on focusing on, and in the remake department, the list includes The Outer Limits, Deathwish and Robocop. I’m fairly ambivalent about The Outer Limits and Deathwish, with the first just being a nice umbrella title for a new anthology series, and Deathwish being a fairly formulaic 1970s series that I never really invested much interest in, besides just enjoying Charles Bronson being a badass. Robocop, however, as the AICN guys points out, is a trickier concept to bring into the 21st century and really do justice to the first movie better than its sequels did. Robocop was violent nearly to the point of satire, but it was done more of a social message than just for the sake of exploitation.HOW MANY BIG BUDGET DISASTER MOVIES ARE DIRECTED BY TWO TIME OSCAR WINNERS?After winning two Oscars for The Incredibles and Ratatouille, one of Pixar’s top directors, Brad Bird, has signed to return to work for Warner Bros, the studio that majorly botched the release of The Iron Giant, back in those grey days when animation was not seen as being particularly financially promising theatrically. Bird is giving the studio a second chance on his live-action debut, a disaster movie called 1906 set during the San Francisco earthquake and the resulting fires that destroyed most of the city. The story revolves around a college student whose investigation of his father’s death leads him to uncover a conspiracy that makes San Francisco vulnerable to the impending disaster. Bird is reworking a script by John Logan (The Aviator) which has been kicking around in development for quite a while, I seem to remember (dating back to the post-Titanic time when every studio wanted their own big budget disaster movie). Just another example of how long projects take to get produced in Hollywood sometimes, if they get made at all.TODAY, WE CELEBRATE OUR…Wolfgang Petersen (Troy, Poseidon) has signed on with Columbia (Sony) to direct Uprising, a sci-fi action movie about humanity’s attempt to fight back after an alien race has successfully invaded and taken over Earth, which of course, sounds a lot like Independence Day, but that was also now over 10 years ago, so I guess it’s fair game to have its concept redone by another big budget event movie. It’s not like alien invasions are some sort of super original thing that hasn’t been done in some way or another dozens of times (just that this particular byline does sound a lot like ID4, or Battlefield Earth, I suppose). The script is being worked on by Charles Leavitt, who also wrote K-Pax, which also had an alien-related themes (sort of).TETROOOOOO!!!!!Francis Ford Coppola’s (Godfather trilogy, Apocalypse Now) is set to start filming in late March in Buenos Aires on his next film, Tetro. Reportedly based on Coppola’s own experiences, Tetro is the tale of the conflicts that arise between the male members of a family known for its creativity, focusing on a multigenerational family of Italian-Argentinians. The cast is led by Vincent Gallo (Buffalo 66) (replacing Matt Dillon who had been previously announced), Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men) and Maribel Verdu (Y Tu Mama Tambien), and you can probably expect Tetro to be released in Oscar season, late 2009 or so.ANT-MAN, ANT-MAN, DOES WHATEVER AN… ANT CANShaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright revealed recently that he’s working on the second draft of the Ant-Man adaptation, which promises to be a slightly less comedic film than what he’s known for (but not humorless, I would guess), including the news that the story will actually involve both men who have called themselves Ant-Man in the comics: Dr. Hank Pym and criminal-turned-good-guy, Scott Lang. I think it’s very interesting that both are included, because Ant-Man is probably one of the “Avengers Prelude” movies (along with Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, etc), I can’t help but wonder if this movie might not actually produce more than Ant-Man. If Scott Lang comes out of the movie being Ant-Man, that could leave room for Hank Pym to become Giant-Man/Goliath in the Avengers movie (really big guy instead of a really tiny guy). Anyway, I can’t say I’ve been super-fascinated with movies about teensy-tiny people (The Incredible Shrinking Man, etc), but the idea of a superhero who ride around on a flying ant is inherently cool on some level. He’s got a massive white helmet too.HULK SMASH… RHINO-LOOKING GREY CGI MONSTERIf you’ve turned on your computer this week, you probably know that the Incredible Hulk trailer debuted Wednesday on MTV. The good news, no… awesome news, is that the Hulk himself looks pretty much perfect. Understandably, the CGI work is not done yet, so there may be some shading (or whatever) issues, but just to compare this Hulk with the Ang Lee version, he looks much more like the Hulk I’ve read about for thirty some years now. Not faring as well, however, is the Abomination, a classic Hulk villain who has had *some* revisionism applied to his look over the years, but basically, his classic look is a very tall reptilian monstrosity with big triangular ears, all sorts of ugly bumps on his face, and huge teeth. The Abomination of the comics is taller, and less dense than the Hulk, and has his super strength all the time, whereas the Hulk has to “Hulk out” by getting angry to fuel his strength. Anyway… the Abomination in this trailer looks pretty much nothing like any comic form I’ve ever seen for him, and instead looks a bit like the Spider-Man villain “Rhino”. Anyway, director Louis Leterrier has done a text commentary for the trailer, and he defends the Abomination’s look, but I’m not really buying it. The action still looks great (a 26 minute Hulk vs Abomination destruction fest at the end!), but I’m just frustrated that a movie that seems to have so much going for it flaked out on something that should be so obligatory as getting a classic villain’s look at least close.YOU WILL BELIEVE A MAN CAN FLY… AGAINDirector Bryan Singer confirmed this week that he will indeed be returning for the sequel to Superman Returns (probably to be titled Superman: Man of Steel), and addressed concerns about how he adapted the character the first time around. Singer says the goal for the second movie is to up the ante, with a higher body count and “unrelenting terror.” So far, the world has seen five big budget Superman movies, and it is true that none of them (except maybe Superman II) really pitted the Big Blue Boy Scout against a danger that was truly, emotionally frightening enough to warrant the abilities of such an unstoppable hero. Yes, the challenges were “big”, but not you know, “Doomsday” big (I speak of the villain). Not that I would necessarily want to see the “Death of Superman” storyline done (actually, I specifically don’t), but something like that would be preferable to the Lex Luthor storylines, especially considering what a lame villain he has been in the movies. I’ll give Bryan Singer free advice right here… an awesome Superman movie villain would be: DARKSEID.A HARBINGER OF X-MEN-ISH MOVIES TO COMEParamount acquired the rights this week to Harbinger, a relatively now-forgotten 1990s comic book series published by Valiant Comics, and created by former Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter. I never read Harbinger, but what I gather is that its story involved young people with amazing abilities, in a (non-costume-wearing) spin on the X-Men, Marvel mutants, etc. That’s also a concept that NBC’s Heroes basically does as well. Anyway, if this movie gets made, the director that Paramount has in mind is Brett Ratner, who came aboard for the third X-Men movie, and turned out a loud, sloppy mess of an ensemble hero movie. Well, at least with Harbinger, it’s a superhero movie that not even most die-hard comic book fans have a whole lot invested in. So, he can basically do whatever he wants, and with low expectations, maybe we can only come out winners. Except, on a grander scale, whenever $100 million or so goes to a big budget superhero movie you don’t care about, that’s potentially one that a fan would really love, that doesn’t get made.TINTIN PLANPLANSA recent interview with Andy Serkis revealed some more details about the upcoming trilogy of motion capture movies based on the classic “TinTin” adventure comics being produced by Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg. Namely, that Spielberg’s movie will come first, Jackson’s will be second, and the director of the third is still unknown (and the list of rumored candidates is legion, including James Cameron, I’ve heard). Serkis also confirmed his own role in the movies, as Captain Haddock, the persistently cranky and blustrous bearded sailor who is one of TinTin’s most frequent companions.That’s it for this week.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

There are plenty of those, too, but the series, hosted by Bear Grylls, focuses on how six different environments — mountains, oceans, grasslands, jungles, deserts, and polar — are increasingly more punishing on the animals who live there.Grylls executive produces the show alongside Oscar-winning cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, BBC natural history grads Martha Holmes and Tom Hugh-Jones, and Grylls’ collaborator Delbert Shoopman — which means there is plenty of talent behind the camera too. They employed approximately 245 crew members during their 82 shoots, which covered more than 1300 days of filming and approximately 1800 hours of footage on all seven continents.The star, who’s bringing back his popular Running Wild series on Nat Geo later this year and is hosting the interactive series&nbsp;You vs. Wild on Netflix beginning April 10 — talked to Rotten Tomatoes about why Hostile Planet is different from other natural history shows.“I grew up on all the classic BBC Planet Earth, Blue Planet [series],” he said. “It was and still is incredible TV, but I suppose what we’re trying to do is really going to give it a really strong, powerful refresh and make it really powerful for a young generation of people who maybe have never experienced wildlife, natural history programming before.”He also told us what he’s watching on TV when he’s not camping out in the wilderness somewhere, and his answers might surprise you.What’s appointment viewing for you?(Photo by National Geographic/Tanja Bayer)To be honest, I’m not a great TV watcher. But I think the things I end up watching are things that involve friends. Over the years I’ve got a few great friends who do TV, so I’ll watch other survival stuff and adventure-y stuff when they have things coming out. The landmark natural history stuff is always in my heart.What’s in your streaming queue?(Photo by ABC)I’m married and have a family and a lovely wife and children, so I end up watching things that they really like. [My wife] Shara at the moment is knee-deep in Netflix’s Money Heist. Because we’re traveling, she’s going, “Make sure you’ve watched up to episode 12, so when we get back we can watch the finale together.” So I’m on the plane catching up on this. I quite enjoy a bit of escapism like that. And actually, what I don’t enjoy is: I find long series that don’t conclude really annoying. And I think in the early days all these streaming services with hundreds of episodes, everyone would plow through it to get to episode 24 and then it still wouldn’t end. You’d think, “that was such a waste of time.” Shara did that with Nashville the other day. We watched the first 15, and I was hooked. We all loved it. It was great. And then I go, “There’s another series?” She goes, “Oh, there’s another seven series.” I go, “How many episodes?” She goes, “130 or so.” We’re not waiting 130 episodes. So I said, “Do me a favor, go to the last episode of season 6 or 7, watch it, tell me if I’ve missed anything.” She watched it, she went, “You didn’t miss anything.”What shows are on your DVR?We’re actually big fans of Amazon and Netflix stuff.What’s coming soon that you can’t wait for?(Photo by National Geographic/Holly Harrison)Nashville season 7. [Laughs]I really do think the natural history stuff is a strong one for us. I have quite a savvy family who are quite hard to please on TV stuff, but they watched the Hostile Planet trailer, and the boys have been texting me, and Shara has been going, “This looks insane!” They almost didn’t really know what I was doing, you know? They knew I was hosting it, but they hadn’t seen any of the footage, and just seeing a bit of it, they’ve all separately been texting me, “OK, this show looks insane.” So from a heart perspective, I’m really excited about that one, and I hope that there’ll be millions and millions of fans around the word. I think traditionally with natural history you’re meant to be wowed. Hostile Planet you go to be almost shocked, because it is hard reality of what a lot of animals are going through. I don’t often cry in programs, but there were definitely tears involved. I mean, we were doing the voiceover yesterday and just even doing the voiceover, it was quite emotional — when the elephants die in the drought and that whole thing.I am excited about Running Wild, because that is coming back to Nat Geo. We’re moving it from NBC after five seasons. It’s a really good pairing with Hostile Planet, and we’re signing some of the biggest guests we’ve ever had. I don’t know why it’s suddenly happened this year, but it’s been amazing. We’re in the middle of filming at the moment. That’s a big one. A lot of my TV focus at the moment is what we’re juggling. We’re finished Hostile Planet and now we’re rolling on to that.Jean Bentley for Rotten Tomatoes: How is Hostile Planet different from other natural history shows?I think a lot of these other ones that we all grew up with were celebrating the beauty of the world, but sometimes it’s almost like you’re looking at a picture, but you’re not seeing the reality of the hard stuff. Hostile Planet really shows that raw, difficult, heartbreaking, painful, hostile end of what wildlife are going through. And I think animals that have been on the edge already, climate change has now pushed them over the edge, but yet these creatures have this incredible resilience and adaptability and survival instinct. Under that pressure is this really amazing and beautiful and heartbreaking [spirit that is] powerful to see. Sometimes it’s a triumph and a lot of times it isn’t. But that is what Hostile Planet is showing: just how hostile the conditions are and what the wildlife are having to go through. It will make you cry. The other ones maybe made you cry because it was so beautiful, if you’re that way inclined, this one, even if you’re not that way inclined, you will cry because it’s very powerful.How do you tackle death on the show?Head on — but the thing is the animals tell that story, actually. And I think, again, beforehand maybe the genre just showed the animals, but now it really follows that journey, and often from different perspectives. So instead of celebrating the lion killing whatever, now it’s a story of the little fawn who, you know, 99 percent of the fawns are dead within their first hour because they’re so vulnerable on these plains. So now this flips it on its head and follows the little fawn deer, and how can they survive when they’re surrounded by hyenas? And that’s why it’s like, “Oh my God” when you watch it.So it’s different from a show like Nat Geo’s&nbsp;Savage Kingdom, for example, which just focuses on the predators. Right?This turns it on its head. This is about the survivors. How do these animals survive when they’re battling climate change, the terrain, and the predators?(Photo by National Geographic/Adrian Seymour)How deeply do you go into climate change and how do you talk about it on the show?We just show how finely balanced so many of these ecosystems are and the change that has happened over the last 150, 20, 10 years and the effects it’s having on animals. So when you see baby elephants dying in the drought after walking hundreds and hundreds of miles to their traditional watering holes and there’s nothing there, it’s pretty heartbreaking when you see it.Is there a call to action at all, or are you just hoping people will be inspired by the message?I think the call to action is awareness, if you can show people [what’s happening]. We live in a cynical world and we’re always battling apathy and cynicism, and the animal stories battle that the best.For Running Wild, you’ve had an insane list of people on the show. Who do you think coped the best with their surroundings?I always resist singling people out as the best or worst, because I never think that’s a particularly good vibe. But what I always say is that people often really surprise you, and I think I’ve learned not to judge books by their cover — especially with some of the ladies, who have just been remarkably resilient and strong and tenacious. I think it’s inspiring because they often don’t expect it themselves because they’ve never done anything like this before. And it’s a reminder that the wild doesn’t care what color you are, what gender you are, how big or small your bank account is. It rewards character and tenaciousness and facing your fears. So that’s always been an inspiring thing for me.Which current celebrities would you love to have on the show?I’ve always had three that I’ve really dreamt of getting on the show. We haven’t got them for five seasons, but I think we’re going to get them in this season. So that’s pretty cool. But we’re not going to say who it is.Is there any pie in the sky person you want?Three of them, and we’re getting them.(Photo by National Geographic/Oliver Clague)Why do you think people are drawn to shows about nature?I think because it’s real and it’s often about families. I think we all relate to that. We all care about our families and then you see it in the wildlife sense, and it’s often so heartbreaking when families are separated and then worse than that when babies lose their lives. And that’s why Hostile Planet is so powerful. It shows warts and all. I think there’s always going to be a hunger in all of us for natural things. You can’t fight hundreds of thousands of years of DNA in us and to think in 50 years suddenly we’re not going to be interested in the wild or adventure or things of the heart because it’s deep in our DNA, that’s [silly]. I think that’s why people love Running Wild. There is something about starting a fire. Why is that exciting for people? But if they’ve never done it before and they’re cold and they’re shivering and they’re desperate and it’s a really powerful moment.What was something that surprised you about producing Hostile Planet and not having to be out in the field as much?Well, I still am out in the field. The only thing that’s changed is now we’re executive producing as well. The privilege of doing that on all of our shows is that it means we pick where we go when we go and the people we go with. And when you spend the amount of time away as we do as a team, it makes a huge difference to be able to have the control to say, “I want to work with great friends and the people that have been alongside me through many adventures.” So for me, executive producing is a privilege of that. And also making sure the stories are told right and truthfully rather than leaving that power to someone else.Hostile Planet airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on National Geographic Channel.Like this?

After stints in between as a wife of Henry VIII on The Tudors and Glinda in NBC’s dark Wizard of Oz retelling Emerald City, she returns this Sunday on The Rook.Richardson plays Linda Farrier, the head of a top-secret government agency for people with paranormal abilities. And while the series is based on a book of the same name, the show quickly diverges from Daniel O’Malley’s work into its own story — one with three potential endings, Richardson told Rotten Tomatoes when we caught up with her ahead of the premiere.That’s one reason why the star told us she’s excited to actually watch the series. We also discussed what she’s been watching recently — she was a big fan of Fleabag, and watched it weekly while it was airing in the U.K. (it was released all at once on Amazon Prime Video in the U.S.). Ahead of The Rook’s premiere on Sunday, June 30, find out more about Richardson’s streaming queue and what to expect from her new series.What’s appointment viewing for you?(Photo by Steve Schofield/Amazon Prime)I tend to watch more in the evening, when it gets dark. The last two things I watched in completion were Fleabag, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and Ricky Gervais’&nbsp;After Life, and I just loved both of them. With Fleabag, I watched it weekly. And also, I happened to be in one place in London at the time that it was showing, and I watched season 2, and then I went back and watched season 1.What’s in your streaming queue?Usually I catch up with things later. After Life, I watched later, and I watched that pretty much back to back.What shows are on your DVR?(Photo by Netflix)Right now I’m on the move constantly, so I have yet to crack into a new series. So, I’m tending to watch one-off films. I still want to watch Black Mirror. I’m late to the game on that. I think it’s fantastic that we live in the time where we hit this golden age for television, where there’s just such a high standard.What’s coming soon that you can’t wait for?I’m excited about seeing The Rook too, because having not watched it. Even though, obviously, part of the story is what I had imagined based on the script. I don’t know the ending. So, honestly, hand on heart, it’s The Rook — just because I like the people that were involved so much, and I’m really curious to see that next.(Photo by Ed Miller/Starz)Jean Bentley for Rotten Tomatoes: I’ve watched a couple of episodes of the show, but I have to confess I’m still not 100 percent sure what’s going on.Richardson: Sometimes I feel like that. When I start a new book, I’m like, “Oh, I don’t know if I understand this well.” But I just trust it, and then it all becomes clear. It all will become clear in the series. To me, obviously, it’s clear. It’s a government agency, a secret service. They have very subtle superpowers, but we don’t know what’s going on in the bigger picture, and it [eventually] reveals itself and the character motivations. Someone at the premiere said they really loved the way each episode wasn’t all wrapped up. Lots of elements are left hanging, and I like that too, because it’s too easy if you know exactly what’s going on.Did you read the book on which the series is based?We were told not to. Immediately after I signed on, I thought, “Great. Time to read the book.” And then everyone said no. Although it’s the same premise, this is different. It will be misleading. So I didn’t read the book.And like all series television — because I remember this from Nip/Tuck — you never know what the next episode’s going to be. It’s so exciting as an actor to look forward to getting the next script. As an actor doing a TV series, you live episode by episode, because you don’t know what’s going to happen to your character in the next one. Will they be good? Will they be bad? You need to cover your bases at all times.Speaking of Nip/Tuck, what you think of Ryan Murphy’s success? What was it like working on that show?I think Ryan Murphy is quite spectacular. I was watching the French Open and Rafael Nadal won his 12th, I think, and the commentators were saying there’s just some extraordinary thing he has. He’s not normal. And although Ryan is normal, he does have superpowers in terms of his output in writing and directing and producing. He’s just a phenomenal talent, basically. And not just in terms of his creative output, but I know that he was one of the first to implement the 50/50 in terms of diversity and female employment, and in terms of crew members. He also does that too.The Rook was very heavy on the 50/50 crew as well — in fact, we had far more female directors than we did male. And Ryan, I think, was very much part of initiating that. The Rook, it was fantastic. It wasn’t just in terms of directors were women. It was also — speaking selfishly for a moment — these great female characters.(Photo by Steffan Hill/Starz)What was it like to work on such a female-centric show, particularly in a genre that isn’t necessarily known for that?When I received the script, I thought, “Oh, this is really interesting. It’s going in a new direction,” with Myfanwy losing her memory. Everyone is completely intrigued by the secret service and spy world. In terms of playing Lady Farrier, I looked at the tapes of Stella Rimington, who, surprisingly, as a woman, was the head of MI5. Margaret Thatcher as first female Prime Minister. These women did have positions of great authority and it’s important that that’s represented.What’s your character like? How does she fit into the mystery?Well, she’s the king in terms of chess pieces. The premise of the show is obviously everything I just said, but also, in episode 1, Myfanwy touches the chess board, and that’s quite a key moment. And then it reveals a secret room that she has, and Farrier’s the king, and Grantchester, Adrian Lester, is the queen, and everyone has their positions. It’s multi-layered. It’s a spy thriller, but playing on many different levels.So although I’m set up as the king, most people within the agency are fighting for that position. In an ambitious world, people want the top jobs. Then there’s Myfanwy, who has this extraordinary ability and is, in some respects, the chosen one. Having not seen it, I don’t know quite how it plays out, but Linda Farrier is sort of the backbone. She’s very much the structure of the agency.(Photo by Warren Orchard/Starz)You’ve only seen the premiere so far, but what can you say how the season ends?I don’t even know what the exact ending is. We definitely shot two, but there was a third in the script. So I don’t even know what the ending is! I have a very good idea. Obviously, I’m not going to say. But you see why I said I wanted to watch The Rook? Because I don’t know the ending.Will it open new questions for a potential season 2, or is it closed-ended?I don’t know the end of it, so I can’t say. I think we just scratched the surface on it, actually. There are so many potential storylines to play out. But who knows? The viewers will answer that question.The Rook premieres Sunday, June 30 at 8 p.m. on Starz.Like this?

She also talks about moving from acting to directing, aliens and reboots, and the new episode of Roswell, New Mexico she directed.by Sophie-Marie Prime | March 19, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Noam Galai/WireImage)Shiri Appleby has been&nbsp;on TV since&nbsp;before she was a teenager.&nbsp;Early on,&nbsp;she guest-starred in&nbsp;shows like&nbsp;7th Heaven and&nbsp;Baywatch, and more recently,&nbsp;she headlined&nbsp;Lifetime’s acclaimed Bachelor-skewering drama&nbsp;UnREAL. But the actress’&nbsp;game-changing role was the lead in 1999’s&nbsp;Roswell&nbsp;— a sci-fi&nbsp;drama series that began with her character, New Mexico high-schooler Liz, being shot and brought back to life by an alien.Now,&nbsp;Appleby is stepping behind the camera — and returning to one of her most iconic roles to do so.&nbsp;She’s directing the Tuesday, March 19 episode of&nbsp;Roswell, New Mexico, a reboot of her late ’90s series. Both iterations of&nbsp;Roswell feature aliens, romance, and feelings of otherness, but in the new series, the characters are 10 years older and their conflicts are much more contemporary.“You know, [in] our show, these kids were in high school and the alien theme was about how everyone felt in high school — you felt out of place and you didn’t feel like you belonged,” Appleby told Rotten Tomatoes of the original Roswell. “In today’s story, these kids are in their late 20s and the alien is about illegal immigration. It feels very timely and very relevant.”Her&nbsp;upcoming&nbsp;Roswell, New Mexico&nbsp;episode, “Songs About Texas,” will be&nbsp;a first for Appleby.&nbsp;In the past, she’s directed TV episodes in which she also starred. This time, she’s staying behind the camera, but that doesn’t mean she’ll stop acting — she says she’s&nbsp;just “taking a minute” to find the right long-term role.Ahead of the episode, Appleby&nbsp;told us about what she’s been bingeing lately and what’s coming soon&nbsp;for her career — both in front of and behind the camera.What’s appointment viewing for you?(Photo by Byron Cohen / Touchstone Television / Courtesy Everett Collection)The last time I did that I was watching Felicity… That should tell you how many years it’s been. I used to love that show. It was my absolute favorite. There was nothing better than Keri Russell. Right?What’s in your streaming queue?(Photo by Hulu)Right now I’m watching Russian Doll. I love Russian Doll … I have been watching Light as a Feather on Hulu. I’m going to direct two episodes of it, so I’ve been really bingeing on that show. I think it’s so charming and wonderful. I was also watching a lot of Pretty Little Liars because I just directed an episode of The Perfectionists. And, I am going to go — which is so funny — to my Netflix account right now so I can tell you what else I’ve been watching.I love to watch a lot of documentaries. I was watching, let’s see, I watched the Fyre documentaries on both Hulu and Netflix. I still watch Stranger Things… I like watching My Next Guest [Needs No Introduction] with David Letterman. I love that.What shows are on your DVR?(Photo by Courtesy of Netflix)I don’t watch real TV anymore! I watched Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, and I’ve been cleaning out my closet obsessively since then.What’s coming soon that you’re excited for?(Photo by ABC/Eric McCandless)The Fix. My best friend, Robin Tunney, has a new show premiering on Monday night on ABC, so I cannot wait to watch every single episode of that.Sophie-Marie Prime for Rotten Tomatoes: Did you go back and watch any of the original Roswell&nbsp;while preparing to direct your episode?Well, I had made every single episode, so I felt very confident that I didn’t need to watch it again and see myself as a 20-year-old. I was just going to let myself go and be immersed in the world that they’ve created.Have you been in contact with any of the original cast at all? I know Jason Behr sent you flowers on your first day.Yeah, Jason and I are still in touch. I’ve been actually texting with Katherine Heigl a lot. Colin Hanks I see, and he’s texted. Majandra [Delfino] lives maybe three blocks away from me so I run into her. It’s such a small, little, tiny community. When you think about that experience, it’s like friends from high school. You know, you kind of pick up right where you left off.We all came from such different backgrounds and we’re going through this really out-of-body experience together. It’s kind of fun to get back to each other and see each other. Everyone has kids now, and [it’s fun] to see what’s happened with their lives and their careers.(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. / Courtesy Everett Collection)What do you and the rest of the original cast think of the reboot?It’s like building a legacy. It’s a complete compliment. I just feel incredibly flattered.What was your first impression when you saw the pilot for the new series?I thought they did an incredible job of having some very iconic moments that we share: like Liz getting shot in the Crashdown Café and Max coming over and saving her life&nbsp;— those really big moments that were very much a big thread of the original series. Then very quickly it becomes its own show, which I thought was so smart, and it tackles these bigger topics.You know, our show, these kids were in high school and the alien theme was about how everyone felt in high school. You felt out of place and you didn’t feel like you belonged. In today’s story, these kids are in their late 20s and the alien is about illegal immigration. It feels very timely and very relevant.(Photo by Lewis Jacobs/The CW)How is it working with Jeanine Mason as the new Liz?I just couldn’t pick someone better to take over the role. She is so impressive as both an actress and a human being. We really had a great time finding ways to get creative with the performance and doing different things. She was just really up for it all. I had a really wonderful time. It felt very much like passing the baton forward. I love what she’s created with this new Liz.What role did the original Roswell play in your career as an actress?Well, it’s so funny, it’s playing a similar role as a director. It really changed my life. I went from a girl that was in high school and I had worked since I was a young kid, but it gave me a career. It really was like everything was “before Roswell” and “after Roswell.”Now I’ve been making this transition into directing, and Roswell is the first show that’s given me a job directing where I’m not acting. Because they gave it to me, Marlene King felt more comfortable giving me an episode directing&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars, and now Hulu is giving me two more episodes of Light as a Feather. It’s just continuing to build. Again, Roswell has come in and just been an incredible, huge part of my journey as a director.(Photo by Lifetime)You’ve had such a diverse career on TV. Do you have any favorite roles that you’ve played?I have this wall in our house where I have my costumes in frames. I have the Roswell gunshot [costume] framed and my mic from Life Unexpected, and then I have Rachel Goldberg’s T-shirt that says “This is What a Feminist Looks Like” with a green coat and her little fanny pack [from UnREAL].&nbsp;Those were definitely my iconic roles.And Girls was an incredible part for me. It really pushed the envelope. To be on a show that was so culturally relevant was really game changing.&nbsp;I think working on Mike Nichols’ movie&nbsp;Charlie Wilson’s War with Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams and Emily Blunt&nbsp;— to be surrounded by all of these incredible talents and feel like I had a real seat at the table — that really changed things for me as well.(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. / Courtesy: Everett Collection.)How and when did you decide to jump from acting to directing? Did you always know that was something you wanted to do?When I did Roswell, there weren’t female directors. We had 61 episodes and we had one female director on the last episode. I didn’t grow up seeing an image of a female director, so I never thought it was something that I could have. I definitely spent my time in editing during Roswell and asked a lot of questions and paid attention, but during my 20s, you just didn’t see it.Then when I was on Life Unexpected they brought on a female director, Liz Allen, and it really kind of rocked my world. Through my relationship with her, she was like, “You can do this.” I started shadowing a lot after I got off Life Unexpected. That’s where I was like, “OK, this is something that I can do.”By the time I did UnREAL, I came to them right away, and I was like, “I have done my homework. I am prepared. I would really love an opportunity.” I’m really grateful to them that in the second season they gave me an episode to direct. I ended up doing four during the course of the series.What has your experience been like directing a show that you’re also acting in, versus something like Roswell, New Mexico&nbsp;and Pretty Little Liars where you’re not appearing on screen?The difference is that you’re not really splitting your focus, but at the same time when you’re directing and acting, it’s pretty powerful. You know, you’re really in it and you can really command the energy of a scene because your acting is putting that out. So, you can really craft how you want it to be.When you’re not acting in it, when you’re sitting back, you can take a breather and really see the scope of the piece. I think it’s incredibly rewarding to work in this space. All this information that I’ve learned and all of these tricks of the trade, of crafting an episode of performance and an episode of TV — to be able to push that information forward and share with these young actors and watch their performance blossom, it is so gratifying. It’s a way of giving back in some ways, and I am just really relishing it.(Photo by Lewis Jacobs/The CW)It’s mentorship from a totally different angle.Absolutely. You know, there are directors that come through your career that really give you these little nuggets that change the way you work. I try to give it as much as I can, because I want to have an impact in the few days that I’m with them.Do you think that there will be an opportunity for you to appear on screen in Roswell, New Mexico?Carina MacKenzie&nbsp;— she’s so talented — if she wants to figure out a way, I’ll do it.&nbsp;Can you share anything else about your upcoming projects? Do you have any on-screen appearances planned?I did an episode of Law &amp; Order: SVU and Lucy Liu was directing it. That was really fun. I just did an episode of Drunk History that aired. But, quite honestly, following up Rachel Goldberg on UnREAL, there are big shoes to fill. I’m just kind of taking a minute to find the right thing… because I really want to give it my all and find the next right character and the next right story.Roswell, New Mexico episode “Songs About Texas” airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. on The CWLike this?

Would he unite the masses, or cause mass chaos the world over? That’s the main gist of Messiah, the new series from executive producers&nbsp;Mark Burnett and Roma Downey.Michelle Monaghan plays CIA officer Eva Geller, a skeptic who lands in the middle of the unfolding controversy. She makes it her mission&nbsp;to uncover the real identity&nbsp;behind this&nbsp;religious figure, played by Mehdi Dehbi — whom the public calls “al-Masih,” a term&nbsp;that&nbsp;means “Messiah” in Arabic. Is he the son of God or a potential terrorist looking to&nbsp;dismantle the geopolitical&nbsp;system put in place to maintain global order?Monaghan met up with Rotten Tomatoes&nbsp;at an intimate reception Netflix through for the series, where she discussed the show’s international appeal, the potential controversy it may spark, and listed off a few of the programs she likes to watch on television and streaming.WHAT IS APPOINTMENT TV FOR YOU?(Photo by HBO)Appointment television? That doesn’t even exist, does it? Appointment television as in, it’s Sunday night and I’m going to watch this tonight? I think the last time, honestly, that I did appointment television was True Detective. Yes, I was on it! There aren’t very many places that does programming like that, aside from HBO.WHAT IS ON YOUR DVR?I don’t have a DVR.WHAT IS IN YOUR STREAMING QUEUE?(Photo by Netflix)The Crown, right now. I’m on episode 4 [of season 3], and I love it. Olivia Colman!&nbsp;I mean:&nbsp;The Favourite, Fleabag. She was amazing in Fleabag. So, that’s what I’m into right now:&nbsp;The Crown. Oh, and I’m watching Succession, which I’m obsessed with. Every single actor on that show delivers. I am glued to every single performance. I think they are all so brilliant; they have incredible chemistry, all of them. I love that show. I think there’s also something very juicy about it. You hate to love watching these people. It’s very Shakespearean.WHAT IS COMING SOON THAT YOU CAN’T WAIT FOR?(Photo by Ursula Coyote/Netflix)Messiah!Aaron Pruner for Rotten Tomatoes: This isn’t the first time you’ve starred in a series about a religious figure’s following, and the fears and suspicions that can arise from such a movement. Once The Path was over, were you looking to continue in this realm?Michelle Monaghan: Honestly, I was just coming off The Path and I had no intention of going back to work. And then James McTeigue, who’s the director, whom I’ve known personally for several years, he contacted me and said, “I’m going to send you this script. We’re doing this thing at Netflix.” And I was like, “Listen, I don’t think this will work.” And then I saw the title and I was like, “I’m definitely not [interested].” I had just come off The Path, this isn’t my thing. I’m an actor into a lot of different genres, you know? And then they sent me the 10 episodes, and I spent an afternoon reading it, and I was hooked. The equivalent to binging — binge-reading — I did it. At the end of the day, I was like, “Man, I gotta do this!”(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix )It also feels like you’re flipping the proverbial coin on the “Is it a religious movement or cult” theme, here.Monaghan:&nbsp;The Path had a very insular perspective. You had one sort of leader, and it took place on a compound. When I did read this and saw the juxtaposition of those ideas, I was like, “Oh, wow, this is really interesting to explore.” And the characters are so very different, as well.(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix)Other recent streaming shows have presented their stories on a global scale — for example, Amazon’s Hanna filmed all over Europe and Netflix’s Sense8,&nbsp;which James McTeigue worked on, shot all over the globe — was that part of the appeal of working on Messiah, for you?Monaghan:&nbsp;Yeah. I think really, for me, what stood out was obviously the global scope of the show. I had never really been a part of anything like that: an international cast. It was such a great, unique opportunity to be a part of something that I think is really important that is not just, specifically, a western point of view. It is about multiple perspectives, it’s very multi-cultural and raises all those ideas and belief systems. So that was one of the main drivers for me to be in it.(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix)So then, I’m assuming you got to travel to some interesting locations for the production.&nbsp;Yes. We shot Jordan for Israel. We shot in Iman and all around that area. For me, that was also part of the decision; I didn’t want to be in the middle of the desert out here in L.A. shooting green screen for the Middle East. I really didn’t want to do that. Understanding the level of commitment and dedication to the story. As an actor, when you’re embarking on any role, you can be anywhere that is practical to what you’re doing. So, to be able to be in that atmosphere, that environment, and interacting with that culture … you know, any culture is only going to serve us, and it did. It left an indelible mark on me.(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix)There’s something about being exposed to other cultures, other ways of life, and accepting it without judgment, which is rare to see on TV and in movies. It’s something Anthony Bourdain seemed to do so well.You just nailed it. He bridged the gap. He provoked conversation. But, he was still himself. He respected the people and their cultures, wherever he went. He never judged them, and I think that’s what’s so important. And, look, I’m not comparing Messiah to anything Anthony Bourdain did. But it’s the way in which he presented different perspectives, it’s precisely that. Look, we don’t choose where we’re born, and unless you have the opportunity to be able to go and experience other cultures, you’re going to have a limited perspective. Isolation breeds misunderstanding. Isolation could be within yourself. It could be within a society, a culture, a country, a religion.(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix)I think that’s just the tip of the iceberg when talking about “the bubble” most of us tend to live in.&nbsp;It’s that same sort of insular perspective that could make someone perceive&nbsp;the concept of a brown-skinned Messiah as problematic. How do you respond to that?It’s something that excites me. The show doesn’t subscribe to any particular religion. I think what people will find when you tune into the show, is that al-Massih doesn’t reveal himself as the Messiah. It’s the projection of everyone else and what they presume him to be. What I really find interesting about this story is that all the characters are searching for something. Eva’s searching for the truth; some people are searching for actual, physical freedom, you know? What he does, as I see it, is he acts as a mirror to your psyche. Everybody’s looking outwardly at him to be the savior of sorts, when in reality he’s throwing everything back at you.(Photo by John Golden Britt/Netflix)Two of the main focal points of the show are the&nbsp;Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a refugee crisis that unfolds at that contentious border. The show also spends a lot of time at the Texas-Mexico border. Is Messiah trying to bridge the gap between&nbsp;these events?What I can say is the show was written in 2016. We didn’t, certainly, have a crystal ball. But obviously, history is repeating itself. So, I think that people will see that. This is an issue that Americans are very familiar with. I think that Americans, in general, are less familiar with the refugee crisis in the Middle East and in Europe. We don’t refer to them as refugees in this country.(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix)There are many layers to the story Messiah is telling.&nbsp;If you had to pick&nbsp;one central message, what do you hope the audience will take away&nbsp;from the series?I hope people watch an episode and identify with a character and then want to dissect that character. I hope it actually provokes a conversation.Messiah is now streaming on Netflix.&nbsp;Like this?

She won two Emmys for American Crime and was part of the ensembles of Southland and The Leftovers. Her latest show, Seven Seconds, may be her most harrowing work yet — at least until she appears in Damon Lindelof’s HBO adaptation of Watchmen.On Seven Seconds, King plays Latrice Butler, a mother whose son Brenton (Daykwon Gaines) is injured in a hit-and-run by a police officer (Beau Knapp). With Netflix vying for Emmy consideration for their dramatic series, King spoke with Rotten Tomatoes by phone about why &nbsp;Seven Seconds&nbsp;was her toughest role yet.But first, King shared her near-total conversion from on-the-air television. Find out what’s on her DVR and streaming queues, and the one thing she makes an exception for on live TV.WHAT IS APPOINTMENT VIEWING FOR YOU?(Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)I am totally converted. I do not do any appointment TV unless it’s a playoff game or a game final.WHAT SHOWS ARE ON YOUR DVR?(Photo by Pari Dukovic/FX)Here’s the interesting thing: Netflix has changed the game in a really big way, so you don’t have to backup your DVR as much as I guess I did maybe eight years ago. Right now what I have not caught up with on my DVR — I haven’t caught up on all my Unsungs. I love those shows. You learn something about artists that grew up with you or your parents were listening to on the record player. You just learn so many things that you didn’t know. For the artists that were grown up when I was a kid, I just looked at them as artists, not as peers — like Special Ed, I’m really looking forward to seeing the Special Ed Unsung and looking forward to seeing the Digable Planets Unsung. I can’t wait for that. So I have those two to watch and whatever other ones that I haven’t seen this season. And MTume I’m really looking forward to seeing too. They were the group that Biggie Smalls sampled [in “Juicy”].Oh, I know what’s on my DVR that I have not watched yet:&nbsp;[American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni] Versace. That is all queued up and ready for me to watch all of them. I have not seen one, so that’s going to be one of those over-at-four-o’-clock-in-the-morning nights.WHAT IS IN YOUR STREAMING QUEUE?(Photo by Aleksandar Letic)So much. I want to see Ibiza. That’s on my radar to watch. I haven’t seen the last two Dave Chappelles, so that’s on there, and Chris Rock’s Tamborine is one that I want to see. Obviously, I’m in this space where I want to see comedies and things that will make me laugh. I’ve been doing TV lately that is so heavy that something light, comedies are the things I’m looking forward to. Another Netflix show I like is Atypical. I’ve only watched three episodes, and I haven’t finished that one. That’s a really good show. It’s funny and it has a little emotional weight to it which I dig. My son turned me onto it. There’s another one my son turned me onto that I’ve watched just the first two episodes which I thought was genius, it’s a cartoon called Big Mouth. I thought that was just awesome.WHAT’S COMING SOON THAT YOU CAN’T WAIT FOR?(Photo by JoJo Whilden/FX)I cannot wait for the new season of Power. It’s starting any day now, and I’m also excited about that new show Pose.(Photo by JoJo Whilden / Netflix)Fred Topel for Rotten Tomatoes: I’m sure you’d hoped for a fourth season of American Crime, but when there wasn’t, was it nice to find another show that really had something to say?Regina King: Yes, absolutely. When I came onto Seven Seconds, I only came on for a season. This story is a one-off story. It was never something for me that was supposed to continue. That story was a story that I felt needed to be told. Some people may feel like it’s a told-again story, but unfortunately, this is who we are as an American culture. It’s unfortunate, but for me, the storytelling that is not scared of holding a mirror up is fascinating for me as an artist.(Photo by JoJo Whilden / Netflix)RT: Is there a specific episode you’re submitting for Emmy consideration as an example of your most powerful work?King: Oh my gosh, I have not gone back to watch the shows, because it was so emotional that I can’t go back to watch. It’s already hard for me to watch myself, because as an actor, the times I’ve watched things that I’ve done, I always feel like, “I wish I would’ve made this choice. Oh, I know I did a better take than that. Why didn’t they use that?” I find myself in this space of shoulda/woulda/coulda and that really is ridiculous. That’s just crazy thinking, but because I do that, I tend to not watch things that I’ve done, unless it’s just something that’s really specific to the press tour, and I need to really know it very well. This one, even if it was specific to the press tour, it was such an emotional place to live for six months that I just can’t go back there. I just can’t.(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)RT: Is Watchmen going to be that emotional for you?King: Damon Lindelof is so brilliant. It is going to be emotional in another way, but I don’t think in that way. Because I’m a mother — I’m a mother of a son — I know what it feels like just when your son goes out to a party. If they’re five minutes after curfew, I’m looking at the clock nervous. That alone, I think a lot of parents can relate to that. That’s why&nbsp;[Seven Seconds] was such a raw place for me to be, but Watchmen is going to have some emotion for some different reasons that I can’t say because Damon is so brilliant. He is doing some things in this show that, if it has been done before, I haven’t seen it.RT: They haven’t said who you’re playing yet, but what is it like to play a new character in the Watchmen world?King: Well, I start on Monday, so so far we have just been going through all the wardrobe design and all the different things that come along with developing who the woman I’m playing is. I am being very careful, because I am not messing up anything. I’m still so honored that Damon is calling on me again. I just want to show up and show out.RT: Does reading the comic book help when it’s a new take on Watchmen?King: I am not reading it. Damon’s asking for me to wait and read it after we finish the first season.Seven Seconds is now streaming on Netflix. Lindelof is shooting the Watchmen pilot for HBO.","section":"What to Watch","tags":"kids, Guide","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/06151732/seven-seconds-regina-king_105-600x314.jpg","slug":"what-to-watch-with-watchmen-and-seven-seconds-star-regina-king"},{"id":"47509243283335","title":"What to Watch With The Girlfriend Experience’s Carmen Ejogo","content":"What to Watchvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})What to Watch With The Girlfriend Experience’s Carmen EjogoThe British actress talks sex and power in the Starz series and catching up on True Detective before her season 3 turn. Plus, she reveals what she loves about her Fantastic Beasts 2 role.by Kit Bowen | December 21, 2017 |  CommentsCarmen Ejogo’s career keeps the actress incredibly busy these days, so watching TV proves to be a little more difficult than she’d like.In just this year alone, Ejogo appeared in sci-fi–horror prequel&nbsp;Alien: Covenant and horror film&nbsp;It Comes at Night, as well as the drama Roman J. Israel, Esq. with Denzel Washington. She also has a few high-profile projects coming up, including the third season of True Detective and the highly anticipated sequel Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, in which she reprises her role as Seraphina Picquery, the president of the Magical Congress of the United States of America.Ejogo also currently stars in season 2 of The Girlfriend Experience, which reaches its conclusion this weekend. The new season departs from the first by telling two separate stories about women in the GFE business. In one story, Ejogo plays Bria, a woman placed into witness protection to escape an abusive relationship with a former client, a gangster she is willing to testify against. The escort life, however, continues to beckon her, and she starts a cat-and-mouse game with those who are trying to control her.Rotten Tomatoes caught up with the British actress to talk about her work on the show and to find out what she likes to watch when – and if — she has any downtime.WHAT’S APPOINTMENT VIEWING FOR YOU?I’m not a massive TV watcher, but I’ve been watching a lot of Eric André and his talk show [on Adult Swim]. His show is a favorite of mine. I’ve been going back to watching old episodes.WHAT’S ON YOUR DVR?(Photo by HBO)I’ve been binge-watching and revisiting some shows. For me right now, revisiting True Detective season 1 and 2 to remind myself of how great that show was and what we may achieve in season 3.WHAT’S ON YOUR STREAMING QUEUE?There are so many shows I like to watch. I know I want to watch The Handmaid’s Tale. That’s next in the queue, things I need to get around to. And Godless, I should check that out. I keep hearing from good sources that it’s great, so, I definitely need to tune into that for sure.WHAT’S COMING SOON THAT YOU’RE EXCITED ABOUT?In addition to what I already mentioned, I’m watching and waiting for new seasons of: Grand Designs, I’m Dying Up Here, Chef’s Table, Insecure,&nbsp;Curb Your Enthusiasm, Atlanta, Peaky Blinders, and black-ish. And movies! Lady Bird&nbsp;— that’s one on my list for sure. I haven’t seen Lady Macbeth, but I’m meaning to&nbsp;— should be phenomenal.Kit Bowen for Rotten Tomatoes: Your story line in The Girlfriend Experience is so intriguing — what can we expect from the finale?Carmen Ejogo: Yeah, it gets even more intriguing, trust me. I hope that what other people have picked up on is this notion or concept of agency and complicity: How much is Bria in control or how much is she affected by those around her? That kind of comes to a head by the end of the episodes, and I think it, for me, was a satisfying way to end her journey, even the plays that have been influencing and manipulating her world. I am quite satisfied with the way she ultimately comes out. It’s still complicated and still very much down to one point of view as to whether she comes back whether or not, or whether it is even that simple. I don’t know if it really ever is that simple. There is still some real complexity, but I feel good about where she ended up.The show is ultimately about sex and power. Were you a little apprehensive about exposing yourself in ways that you maybe never have before onscreen?Ejogo: Yes, sure. As somebody that has been in this industry for many years, to see the potential of bringing sex to the screen has always been there, as a female actress. I’ve always avoided it, frankly, because it never felt like it was going to be handled in a way that was really nuanced and interesting. I think working with [writer/director] Amy Seimetz made it clear to me that it was going to be all of those things because she is really rad, and she is really interesting as a woman in herself. She is not scared of both sides of the coin when it comes to sex and women and men. So, this felt, for the first time, like the right story to bring to the screen.I have to go into every job I do with a sense of fearlessness and willingness to take chances and to walk through the space blindly at times and have faith. To be able to have that kind of comfort level, you really have to trust the people you are working with and the filmmaker. It was a real gift to be working with the director who also wrote the piece and who also happens to be a woman, a really cool woman. All those things combined made it feel like it was a trip worth taking.It is handled in a way that makes sense to the story. It’s very candid, in a way, but also beautiful in the way it’s approached.Ejogo: I agree and I really am proud of this project. I think you can go back to the viewer and watch it several times, and I suspect that it will be viewed sort of in a new direction every time. And not all material offers that kind of depth of intrigue and doesn’t stand up to that kind of interrogation. This piece really does. So I’m very proud of it. I love the character of Bria, I really do.We’re also very much looking forward to Fantastic Beasts 2. Is there anything you can tell us about the upcoming sequel and your role in it?Ejogo: I feel like the worst interviewee when people ask me questions about Fantastic Beasts, because I never have anything to offer. I will be shot if I said anything. [laughs] There’s nothing I can ever divulge.How about a general feeling about it for yourself?Ejogo: To be part of the world in any capacity is exciting for me, as it is for you. Being part of the process of filming is so — every person’s dream to imagine what it must be like to have the ideal acting job! Because you’re literally on these fantastic sets, in the most stunning outfits I’ve ever worn. You’re been handled by the best hair and makeup people. The entire character has been realized by an incredibly impeccable group of artists around you and you have to show up and do your bit. It’s just like the dream gig, so I am always happy to show up as Seraphina in whatever capacity I can. I am just very grateful that I get to show up in No. 2.The Girlfriend Experience’s season 2 finale airs Sunday, December 24, on Starz.","section":"What to Watch","tags":"Mary, hollywood, Max, 45, halloween","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/21163858/the-girlfriend-experience-carmen-ejogo-600x314.jpg","slug":"what-to-watch-with-the-girlfriend-experience-star-carmen-ejogo"},{"id":"47509243285384","title":"What To Watch With Frontier’s Landon Liboiron","content":"What to Watchvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})What To Watch With Frontier’s Landon LiboironPlus, how Michael Smyth is the Luke Skywalker of Frontier.by Fred Topel | November 21, 2017 |  CommentsWhile Jason Momoa goes under the sea as Aquaman in Justice League this week, his passion project also returns to Netflix.&nbsp;Season 2&nbsp;of Frontier picks up in the Canadian wilderness with the fate of Declan Harp (Momoa) after he escaped the noose and collapsed in the woods, and Michael Smyth (Landon Liboiron) trying to carry Harp’s load for the Black Wolf Company.Liboiron spoke with Rotten Tomatoes about the six-episode second season of Frontier. But first, he told us how he spends his TV time.WHAT IS APPOINTMENT TV FOR YOU?Generally an HBO show. I really, really am fascinated by dark comedies and stuff like that. Even Curb [Your Enthusiasm], I couldn’t wait for Curb to come back. If I’m already a fan of the creator, I was really excited to watch The Deuce because you want to see what he’s doing next. So I think those are the shows where I need to be like, “OK, I need to see it now.” Generally those are the shows people are going to talk about and I want to be up to date. I was so late onto the Game of Thrones bandwagon, I think it was four or five, maybe even six season I hadn’t seen any of it. I remember there was this one night where two of my really good friends met. They hadn’t met before and they immediately started talking about Game of Thrones. They spent a good hour and a half talking about Game of Thrones which I hadn’t seen, so I just sat there and listened. I was like, “Never again,” so I immediately started watching Game of Thrones. I think it’s also one of those things where you want to be able to talk about these shows. Especially in my industry, we all want to talk about it.WHAT’S ON YOUR DVR?Oh man, I’m actually watching a lot more films than television these days. There’s this new streaming service called FilmStruck, which is the Criterion Collection. I’m kind of in the stage of my life where I need to go back and watch what was before. I’m very interested in the stuff I haven’t seen yet from the past, than what’s building up [on my DVR]. It’s so great that there’s so much content out there but how do you keep up really with everything that’s going on?WHAT IS IN YOUR STREAMING QUEUE?I have it all. I kind of lean towards Netflix whenever I want to laugh. I can always count on some good comedy because of all the [standup] specials that they do now. I just watched the Patton Oswalt special. It’s so, so touching and beautiful and funny. So I usually go to Netflix for when I need to feel light and laugh, HBO when I want to really watch something that will really, really push me to think. I’m so behind on their shows. I really want to watch Rome. I want to finish Boardwalk Empire. I haven’t finished Boardwalk Empire yet. I’m so behind. And then I go to FilmStruck as I’m learning about the history of film and just educating myself on the past masters and all that kind of stuff. I jump around based on what my mood is and what I’m interested in. If I’m hungover I’ll probably just sit and watch Netflix all day, right? Then when I wake up, I’m like, “Ooh, I need to really get a creative boost.” I’ll go to HBO or something. It’s all different.WHAT SHOWS CAN’T YOU WAIT FOR?Can I say my own show? [Laughs]Fred Topel for Rotten Tomatoes: You certainly can. A lot of people do.Landon Liboiron: I don’t know. I’m so scatterbrained with it all. I don’t keep track of what’s coming.RT: That’s cool. You’re more about catching up.Liboiron: Yeah, definitely. I definitely watch in my own time, what I’m feeling at the moment.RT: Are most of your scenes with Sokanon (Jessica Matten) this season?Liboiron: Where we start in season 2 with Michael and Sokanon is that Michael and Sokanon are just trying to keep the Black Wolf Company afloat. It’s the two of them working together and the growth of their relationship actually. Obviously, a lot happens in six episodes. Eventually it leads to all the forces joining again.RT: This season’s episodes begin with quotes from musicians. Did that mean a lot to you?Liboiron: That, I wasn’t actually even aware of until later. I wasn’t aware of them when we got the scripts. That wasn’t a part of it. It had no influence in terms of what I was doing with my character. It’s an interesting idea.RT: It does suggest that modern-day business, like the music industry, is relevant to the old business of the colonial trade.Liboiron: Of course. It’s humanity, right? It’s a circle. It’s just a big circle, man.RT: How far has Michael come from waking up on this ship in season 1 to being a central part of Harp’s company?Liboiron: Yeah, in season 1 he’s much more voyeuristic in the sense that he’s just sort of being dragged along. He’s sort of a prisoner to the world. He’s just doing anything he can to make it. In season 2, he’s taking a lot more control. He’s deciding that this is going to be his new world. He’s almost getting sucked into it a little bit if that makes any sense. It’s the addiction of the business of it, the survival of it. He’s definitely a con man. He’s definitely a guy who likes to win. He does it in a different way than maybe the ruthless characters in the show. He’s very conniving and cunning. I think he’s kind of getting addicted to that new way of life and he wants to continue it.RT: Has this adventure made him more sincere and given him a purpose?Liboiron: I guess you could say it gives him a purpose. I remember the Blackies [Peter&nbsp;and Rob Blackie], the creators of the show, would constantly compare him to a Luke Skywalker kind of character. His journey is very similar where it’s like here’s this guy who’s just kind of living his life and then he gets sucked off into the new world. Yeah, the Black Wolf Company has definitely given Michael his sense of purpose which has caused him to make the decisions in his personal life, with Clenna and his past, just moving forward.Frontier season 2 premieres November 24 on Netflix.","section":"What to Watch","tags":"YouTube, The, critic, psychological, Columbia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/21211617/Frontier-season-2-trailer-screencap-Landon-Liboiron-600x314.jpg","slug":"what-to-watch-with-frontiers-landon-liboiron"},{"id":"47509243281286","title":"What to Watch With Fear the Walking Dead‘s Maggie Grace","content":"What to Watchvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})What to Watch With Fear the Walking Dead's Maggie GraceThe former Lost star discusses her return to television, keeping secrets, and cutting the cord.by Jean Bentley | April 13, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by AMC)The fourth season of Fear the Walking Dead moves the post-apocalyptic (or, maybe mid-apocalyptic) action from Mexico to Texas. But that’s not the only major change to hit the Walking Dead spin-off. There will also be time jumps and a new group of survivors fighting to make a life in a post-walker world.One of the newbies is a familiar face: The Walking Dead‘s Morgan, who moves from the flagship series to its spin-off. TWD‘s Lennie James is joined by Lost&nbsp;and Taken star Maggie Grace and fellow new cast members Garret Dillahunt (Raising Hope), Jenna Elfman (Dharma &amp; Greg), Kevin Zegers (Gracepoint), and Evan Gamble (Hap and Leonard).Ahead of the season premiere, which also acts as a crossover between the two series, Grace spoke to Rotten Tomatoes about her fierce new character, returning to television more than a decade after Lost, and having to keep mostly everything about her role secret.But first, she dished on her deepest, darkest DVR secrets, and divulged her TV viewing habits and which&nbsp;other new show she’s most looking forward to seeing.What’s appointment viewing for you?(Photo by AMC)Sadly I don’t have any in terms of live television except Fear the Walking Dead, so I will be watching our show, hopefully with the cast. But I don’t have television per se, but I watch streaming. Being a part of this show makes me want to watch it live Sunday night with the cast and friends.Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;You cut the cord?Like, I’ve never had the cord to begin with.We’d ask what’s on your DVR, but you don’t have one.I travel a lot and I really like to sit down and watch something with the intention to watch it as opposed to zoning out. I plan to watch things. I’m not big into channel-flipping. I don’t love that experience where I feel like hours are stolen from me and I’m not sure what I watched.What’s on your streaming queue?(Photo by HBO)I’m gearing up for a re-watch of The Wire, the greatest television show ever made. And The Honorable Woman, it’s this great hidden gem.What’s coming soon that you can’t wait for?(Photo by Hulu)The Handmaid’s Tale. … I binged [season 1]. It is heavy. It was a dark time.Jean Bentley for Rotten Tomatoes: Tell me about your new character, Althea.Grace: She’s both unusually capable and emotionally deep. Somehow after everything she’s been through, even before society was lost, she uniquely prepared not only to survive but thrive in this post-apocalyptic environment. She’s got a sly sense of humor. She’s a bit of a wild card. I’m never quite sure what I’m allowed to say about season 4 — there’s so much I want to say about her; there’s so many things I love about her. I think she’s scrappy, which is, for me, the most fun part about playing her. She’s always looking for solution after solution.RT: We’ve seen in the trailer that she meets up with The Walking Dead‘s Morgan. What was it like working with Lennie James, who just joined the show?Grace: I adore Lennie. I’m really happy it was him. He’s a really kind, generous actor. I’ve loved his work in other things, so I’m really glad our characters intersect so much. Everything’s easy and relaxed with him.(Photo by AMC)RT: What’s it like joining a show in its fourth season? It seems daunting, though that not might be the right word.Grace: No, daunting is the perfect word. It’s like switching schools halfway through middle school — everyone already knows each other, you don’t know where to sit at lunch. It’s definitely intimidating. And there’s a lot to catch up on in terms of the mythology of the whole Walking Dead universe. I came into it with very little notice so there was a lot to learn along the way.RT: Although Lennie isn’t new to the Walking Dead universe, he was new to the show too. What was that like?Grace: Lennie and Garrett and I had a lot of time together right at the beginning, which was great because we were all in the same boat. We were all new to the show, so that worked out perfectly.RT: With the show’s move to Austin, Texas, from Mexico, there were probably a lot of new crew members to.Grace: It was an odd feeling. It was unlike any work experience anyone’s ever had. It was a mix of crew that had been there since the beginning and some brand new crew that was based in Austin, and cast that was new and cast that had been there since the beginning, and writers and the showrunners that were there in a new location. But I think reinvention has certainly been a part of the series from the beginning, whether it was season 2 on the boat or a Broke Jaw Ranch in 3, it does keep reinventing itself. This is certainly a more extreme reinvention, but hopefully one that’s exciting and leaves viewers unsure of what’s around each corner and what to expect. I think there were a lot of great surprises in it as an actor.(Photo by AMC)RT: There’s going to be a time jump this season, but you probably can’t say too much about that.Grace: I will say this, the writers have certainly played with time in interesting ways in this season. I never know what to expect.RT: You were on Lost for several years, another show about surviving in a beautiful landscape. Do you think there are any more similarities between the two shows?Grace: It really does feel similar day to day because you have this ensemble cast of grounded characters going through extraordinary circumstances in a really rugged environment. I would say that’s a fair comparison — just the ensemble and that environment.RT: What’s it like to be a series regular on TV again?Grace: That’s great, I love the sense of camaraderie it gives, and it serves as a nice anchor in life to keep going back to the same place. I had avoided doing television for many years, but I’ve really come to love having the same group of people and really getting to know the crew and having a character that can unfold over time. And I think that TV is the place now where all the creatives or directors can really make choices. That’s what’s happened in the last decade.RT: Good job in your first season of cryptically teasing the show because you can’t reveal too much information! It’s definitely a hard task.Grace: There’s so much I want to say! I don’t understand [the secrecy], because I would just think it would make the audience more excited to watch it — not that they wouldn’t watch it. It got really comical at WonderCon because it was so, so basic. It was like, “Yes, emotional things happen to various characters in various geographical locations.” I was like, “Aw, come on.”Fear the Walking Dead season 4 premieres Sunday, April 15 at 10:10 p.m. after the season 8 finale of The Walking Dead, then moves to Sundays at 9 p.m. weekly on AMC.","section":"What to Watch","tags":"Games, Paramount, Grant, Sundance, Holiday, rom-coms, vampires, Hallmark, movie, Tomatazos, Dark, Mudbound, Cinematographers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/13165831/ftwd-maggie-grace-thumb.jpg","slug":"what-to-watch-with-fear-the-walking-deads-maggie-grace"},{"id":"47508635962754","title":"24 Fresh Giant Monster Movies","content":"24 Framesgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})24 Fresh Giant Monster Moviesby Alex Vo | March 7, 2017 |  CommentsMoviedom’s main ape makes his first theater appearance since Peter Jackson’s 2005 remake with&nbsp;Kong: Skull Island, a 1970s-set adventure starring Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson who travel to the King’s home to confirm his mythic existence.

Furthermore, in director John Badham’s grim masterpiece (which Rocky&nbsp;director John G. Avildsen was slated to direct before parting ways over creative differences), Tony generally proved to be his own worst enemy, with a smart mouth, explosive temper, and penchant for violence that collectively had a way of slamming shut the doors that his talent, charm, and looks opened for him.In other words, Tony Manero was a small-time loser with big-time ambitions. He was racist, virulently misogynistic, narcissistic, and indifferent to the suffering of others, most notably Annette (Donna Pescow), a vulnerable, heartbreakingly sad admirer who followed him like a lost puppy the entire film and was repaid for her devotion with a sexual assault by two members of Tony’s creepy gang, who had all of his many horrible flaws and none of his redeeming virtues. Even Tony’s climactic dance contest win in Saturday Night Fever&nbsp;was tainted by the racism of a crowd that only voted for him and his partner because they were white, unlike the couple that deserved to win.Movies are full of purehearted dreamers who overcome formidable obstacles through talent, will, and a ferocious determination never to give up, no matter how bleak things might look, and&nbsp;Saturday Night Fever, to its eternal credit, is not one of those movies. Staying Alive, however,&nbsp;to its eternal detriment, most assuredly is. It shamelessly embraces all of the hoary show business and dance movie cliches its predecessor boldly eschewed.To put things in animation terms, between John Badham’s Oscar-nominated 1978&nbsp;film and&nbsp;Sylvester Stallone’s&nbsp;1983 follow-up, the vibe went from Ralph Bakshi‘s New York grit and grime to Walt Disney’s sweetness, polish, and shine. Alternately, if the classic Italian neorealist milestone&nbsp;The Bicycle Thieves&nbsp;had spawned a sequel in which struggling father Antonio recovered his bike, trained under the mentorship of a gruff but kindly veteran cyclist, and won the Tour de France, the tonal shift would have been&nbsp;every bit as jarring, insane, and shameless as Staying Alive’s brazen switch from hard-edged realism to gaudy wish fulfillment fantasy. Staying Alive was a commercial success, to be sure, but at the cost of Saturday Night Fever’s dark, sweaty, coked-up soul.The Zero(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Staying Alive trades Brooklyn for Broadway as its primary setting and a very 1970s darkness and social consciousness for 1980s upbeat flash. Tony is no longer a pill-popping degenerate who lives with his folks, works at a hardware store, and wows the ladies at dance clubs, but a focused, disciplined winner ferociously devoted to chasing his dreams.Tony has similarly ditched the posse of poignantly pathetic, drug-addled, violently misogynistic bigots in order to pursue his noble aspirations to Broadway stardom. He’s off drugs and high on life. He doesn’t curse anymore. He doesn’t smoke, he doesn’t drink, and he doesn’t beat up people of color. His only real remaining vice is women, and even in that department he’s evolved from Neanderthal cretin to nice guy, though he finds it exceedingly difficult to stay faithful, and his affections are split between&nbsp;a pair of love interests who fall rather neatly into the categories of devilish diva and girl next door.The better Tony is as a human being, though, the worse he is as an anti-hero, and that is not good for the movie as a whole. Staying Alive shaves away all the rough edges that made Tony so compelling, rendering him another generic dreamer distinguished only by the fact that he looks, moves, and talks like John Travolta near the prime of his youth.The girl next door is Jackie (Cynthia Rhodes), a sweet, modestly talented dancer and singer Tony likes enough to string along — but not enough to commit to her, although he does get awfully jealous when he sees Carl, with whom Jackie has sizzling musical chemistry onstage, gazing longingly at her. Incidentally, Carl is played by Frank Stallone (i.e. brother to Sylvester), who also wrote and performed much of the music on the soundtrack, and whose song “Far from Over” landed in the top 10 and earned him both Golden Globe and Grammy nominations.The other, more important love interest is Laura (future soap opera queen Finola Hughes), a posh British dancer and woman of wealth and taste who takes a fancy to Tony, but only as a boy toy, a sexual conquest to be used and then discarded when she tires of him. That proves more difficult than anticipated when, due to Tony’s unbelievable, irrepressible talent, as well as the time-honored cliches frequently found in movies like this, he’s promoted to male lead of Satan’s Alley, the hilariously overwrought Broadway extravaganza at the film’s core.(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Saturday Night Fever benefited from an almost documentary-like sense of verisimilitude — it was pop sociology you could dance to — whereas Staying Alive hilariously depicts the Broadway world of the early 1980s as overwhelmingly heterosexual and drug-free, even as Satan’s Alley is comically over-the-top in its homoeroticism. The big closing&nbsp;production number is one third proto-Showgirls&nbsp;kitsch&nbsp;minus the satire, irony, and self-consciousness; one third singing, dancing outtake from William Friedkin’s notorious drama Cruising; and one third knock-off of&nbsp;The Apple. The sexed-up, scowling choreography, meanwhile, suggests something&nbsp;Bob Fosse might come up with if he were hit in the head and suffered a neurological malady that removed all his talent.It speaks to the profound disconnect in tone and quality between Saturday Night Fever and its dopey, widely despised follow-up that Tony spends much of the film apologizing for the way he behaved in the first film, for being a potty-mouthed (no place for that in a PG-rated, family-friendly film like Staying Alive!), woman-hating, pill-popping, disrespectful creep.In real life, that would be an admirable gesture. Here, it feels like Tony is apologizing for everything that made his character complicated and interesting in Saturday Night Fever. When he apologizes to his skeptical mother in Staying Alive, Tony even tells her that the sober, hardworking young mensch she sees before her is the real Tony.“That wasn’t the real you back then?” she inquires earnestly, to which Tony answers, “Yeah.”In actuality, the real Tony Manero is the sexy, darkly magnetic monster of id and ego from the first film. It’s this&nbsp;domesticated clone, who looks like the old Tony but doesn’t talk or act anything like him, who seems egregiously phony, as does Staying Alive as a whole.Final Verdict(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Travolta may be playing a perversely cleaned up and watered down version of one of his signature characters, a kinder, gentler striver you would be happy to bring home to mother, but the Grease&nbsp;superstar and pop icon nevertheless oozes boyish charm, sexiness, and blinding movie star charisma.He’s almost too appealing and likable here, since it was precisely that air of incoherent, bottomless rage that made his Oscar-nominated performance in Saturday Night Fever so riveting and endlessly rewatchable. As a follow-up to an unexpected American classic, Staying Alive is an insult to everything its predecessor stood for. As a vehicle for Travolta’s movie star magnetism, however, it’s full of breezy pleasures.&nbsp;Ultimately, Staying Alive is ragingly imperfect, and&nbsp;it does many things very, very wrong, but there is at least one thing that it does very right.At the very end of the movie, after he’s triumphed in Satan’s Alley and really stuck it to his co-star and director&nbsp;with an elaborate, impromptu solo against their wishes, Tony decides to celebrate by strutting down the Manhattan sidewalk to the Bee Gees’ all-time great “Staying Alive.”&nbsp;Travolta shakes off the strictures of cliche, convention, and formula, and the film ends on a note of unexpected victory.In a film&nbsp;ferociously devoted to doing whatever it thinks its audience wants, this final moment marks the only time when pandering to the audience turns out to be the right move.&nbsp;The ending, and only the ending, of Staying Alive is absolutely perfect. It cannot be improved upon. That alone is enough to distinguish it from every other film I’ve written about for this column so far.Nathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

Wells-inspired Time After Time, and FOX’s comedy Making History. The repetitious format of TV has always lent itself well to history jumping&nbsp;stories, as we’ll see with these 24 shows featuring some major time travel antics.Doctor Who (1963-present)Seriously long-running show about a designated Time Lord curing what ails the Earth throughout the years. In its fifth decade, Peter Capaldi became the show’s twelfth de facto Doc.Outlander (2014-present)Caitriona Balfe plays a 1945 wartime nurse who’s cast away from her husband and back in time to 1743 Scotland where she falls into a torrid romance with a Highland soldier (Sam Heughan).12 Monkeys (2015-present)In this sci-fi series adapted from the Terry Gilliam movie of the same name (which in turn was based on experimental 1962 short La Jetee), James Cole plays a 2043 chrononaut sent back in time to prevent a world-decimating virus.Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008-09)No fate but what we remake: Avoiding the dour endgame of Terminator 3, this two-season show saw post-T2 Sarah and John Connor leaping forward in time to 2007 where they scrambled to avoid more cyborg assassins, skeptical law enforcement, and anyone else with designs on the future.Legends of Tomorrow (2016)With the world under Vandal Savage’s control in 2166, lord of time Rip Hunter tears the temporal fabric a new one: in 2016, he assembles a team of DC superheroes to prevent the Savage rise.Lost (2004-10)J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof’s mindbending drama centered on a group of plane crash survivors trapped on a mysterious island that not only changed location but also transported its inhabitants to the past.Heroes (2006-10)The show wasn’t about time travel per se, but prominent character Hiro Nakamura’s ability to manipulate time played a big part.Timeless (2016-present)A trio of timecops pursue a mastermind crook out to alter human history to his dastardly benefit.Quantum Leap (1989-93)Scott Bakula is Dr. Sam Beckett who, under threat of his time-travelling lab getting the plug pulled by the government, sends his consciousness out from the present. Throughout each historical leap, he must take on a new identity and fix something wrong in the past in attempting return to the present.Continuum (2012-15)In 2077, Vancouver is not a nice place to live. Corporate oligarchs dominate the continents and terrorists, hellbent against the system, travel back in time to tear up the roots. Officer Kiera (Rachel Nichols) and her amazing jumpsuit are pulled to 2012 as well.Hindsight (2015)Becca Brady gets cold feet before her second wedding and side steps back to 1995, on the day of her first betrothal, and seizes the opportunity to redo her next 20 years right.Tru Calling (2003-05)She may look like just any other morgue employee filing paperwork and showing corpses to DUI offenders, but Tru Davies has a secret power: she can reset and relive the day as a calling to save the recently deceased.Samurai Jack (2001-04)A feudal Japan swordsman is thrown into the future where his demonic opponent has taken over the world. Creator Genndy Tartakovsky will air 10 episodes later this year or next, to properly conclude the story over a decade after Samurai ended on Cartoon Network.Life on Mars (2006-07)John Simms plays a Manchester police officer who, after a bonk on the head by a moving automobile, wakes up in 1973.Goodnight Sweetheart (1993-99)Television fixer Gary Sparrow is stuck in routine until he finds a portal back to 1940s Britain, and gets entangled in comedic and romantic misadventures within both decades. A 2016 special saw Nicholas Lyndhurst reprising his role as Gary, who is permanently stuck in the past but finds an opportunity to return to modern day.Peabody’s Improbable History (1959-60)As with most stories, this is about a genius talking dog with a time machine who adopts a human boy from a back alley. Pupper Peabody originally appeared in segments on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, though he later got a DreamWorks animated movie and subsequent Netflix show.7 Days (1998-2001)Alien technology recovered from the Roswell UFO crash is crafted by the NSA into a working time machine, which can send government agents back a week to avert disasters (but not far back enough to save the UPN channel).The Time Tunnel (1966-67)To avert government shutdown, two directors of a secret lab hurl themselves into the swirling psychedelics known as The Time Tunnel, where they become privy to some of mankind’s greatest hits. Back in the present, their colleagues help guide the two back towards the present lest they be forever lost somewhere along the infinite corridors of time.Histeria!

He is “an amalgam of several people,\" including, \"more than he'd like to admit, probably elements of my uncle Paul.”by Whitney Friedlander | April 29, 2021 |  CommentsAuthor Paul Theroux’s 1981 novel The Mosquito Coast was meant to be an attack on Reagan-era economics and its views toward consumerism and the environment.Told from the viewpoint of a 14-year-old boy trying to understand his father, we find the frequently failing, yet brilliant, inventor Allie Fox leading his family of four away from modern civilization and deeper into Central America. Then things get complicated. The 1986 film adaptation, which was directed by Peter Weir, written by Paul Schrader and starred a grimy, stubbly Harrison Ford in horn-rimmed glasses, came away with mostly favorable reviews and has 76% Tomatometer score.“The movie has been directed and acted so well, in fact,” wrote late&nbsp; Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert in his review of the film, “that almost all my questions have to do with the script: Why was the hero made so uncompromisingly hateful?”(Photo by Apple TV+)This is also very much the issue in Apple TV+’s new series version of The Mosquito Coast. A prequel of sorts that’s set in the modern day, it stars actor (and nephew of Paul) Justin Theroux, as Allie – this time a mechanic working in a dusty border town. While determined to find ways to make renewable resources out of junk and get a patent for his work, he forces his teens – Gabriel Bateman as son Charlie and Logan Polish as daughter Dina – to eschew technology like cell phones as he and wife Margot (Melissa George) fuel their cars and air conditioners with leftover oil from fast-food restaurants.Read Also: “125+ Books Becoming TV Series That We Cannot Wait to See”Things are going more-or-less fine until the feds come looking for Allie. Instead of skipping town by himself, it’s decided that the family is better protected if they stay together. Soon, they’re on the lam south of the border.Actor Theroux is aware that this decision may make his hero seem unlikeable.“As a person, I love it when a character has, you know, many facets and sides to them,” Theroux said during a recent Zoom call while his gray pit bull mix, Kuma, roamed in the background and occasionally barked her own commentary. “What I tried to do was make him, in turns, charismatic in some instances and frustrating in others. So I hope that people go hot and cold on him because it almost feels like it’s more of a real relationship. I think it’d be a bit boring if he just sort of had his chin to the wind and was doing everything beautifully for his family and everything was all perfect.”Plus, Theroux reminded, “Tony Soprano was not the nicest guy in the world and The Great Santini was one of the most terrifying father figures ever, but yet, completely compelling.”(Photo by Apple TV+)What also makes Theroux’s Mosquito Coast character particularly compelling is what exactly he (or maybe he and his wife?) did to cause them to live on the edge and now go into hiding. It isn’t until episode four that fans get a potential clue as to the Foxes’ past.“The truth is that I’m a cheap date,” series co-creator and showrunner Neil Cross said in a separate Zoom chat. “I like adventure stories. I like thrillers. I’ve got I’ve got the nervous hosts compulsion to entertain their guests.”Cross, who is a devout fan of author Theroux’s books, said it was important to him that the series was “a character piece. And that, at its narrative heart, it is this kind of quite unique family dynamic. I want to tell that in the context of a show that was as exciting and intriguing as I could make it.”“Allie is inspiring and he’s genuinely capable of great love and great enthusiasm,” Cross continued of his lead character. “He’s immensely clever. He’s a fantastic problem solver. And it would be exhausting to know him.”This is also hinted at by the look of the show, which is rich with a feel of grime and sweat while also casting shadows that there might be something more sinister going on. During a phone interview, executive producer Rupert Wyatt, who directed the first two episodes, said he worked with director of photography Alex Disenhof on evoking “the colors of 21st century America [such as] neon [and] very strong blacks” for the early episodes.(Photo by Apple TV+)Wyatt said they looked at what he called the “strong palate” of places like Paris, Texas, and then “infuse it with a kind of Steinbeck; Northern California sort-of farmlands and the notion of the romanticism of that, but also the tragedy of it in terms of the Depression.” The palate softens as the characters head to the desert and then “as we go into the kind of more tropical climates of Mexico and, ultimately to the coast, we start to bring in the greens and the stronger primary colors and heat it up.”He added that “the general thought, always for us, was that we were going to follow this family, we weren’t going to get ahead of them. So camera-wise, we’d always be on their backs where possible, and feel like we’re journeying through this landscape with them rather than getting jumping ahead and bringing them into scenes.”So why a prequel? Co-creator Cross also wanted to make a point of distancing his work from that of the movie adaptation because “there was, to my mind, no point trying to revisit and kind of Xerox something that had already been done so very well.”Plus, he said, “the Allie Fox who appears in a novel is, in some ways, a kind of an American archetype of the great American contrarians. But it’s also somebody who belongs very specifically to a very particular set of economic, political and cultural circumstances.” He said that “because that had been done, that kind of compelled me to think, OK, so who would that guy be now?”For star Theroux, there’s an added layer to nail the role. He said the character is “an amalgam of several people. There are definitely elements of my grandfather, elements of my uncles, and — more than he’d like to admit&nbsp;— probably elements of my uncle Paul.”(Photo by Apple TV+)That could make for some awkward family gatherings, especially since – as a recent Esquire profile recently attested – the family is good at joshing each other: “The only thing Justin’s known for,” Paul Theroux is quoted as saying in that story, “is that when he was a boy, he ate a Styrofoam cup. It’s family lore: Hey, s–t, Justin won an Emmy! Remember the time he ate a Styrofoam cup and then puked it onto his shoes?”“It’s not overt,” actor Theroux told us about the resemblance between his character and his uncle. “I think all of them know what I’m describing. So I think no one’s shocked, you know, at this point.”He said this is also less pressure than his work on another famous book adaptation, HBO’s The Leftovers. That was based on author Tom Perrotta’s novel about a rapture that wipes out a giant chunk of Earth’s population.“With Tom and The Leftovers, I put [writers] on a very high pedestal. So, anytime you approach them with a question, you should do it with your hat in your hand,” Theroux said. “This one, the pressure was kind-of off because I have pre-existing relationship. I could just pick up the phone and say guess what, I’m playing Allie Fox in Mosquito Coast, let’s talk about the character. And it’s probably a little bit of proud uncle syndrome, where he’s happy to chat, not just about my questions, but just what’s going on in life.”It’s probably fitting then that Cross said that in “one of my very last shots of the season, we see the emotional effect of what it is to love, and be loved, by Allie.”The Mosquito Coast premieres April 30 on Apple TV+.","section":"Binge Guide","tags":"GLAAD, nightmare, Prime, spider-man","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29112231/The_Mosquito_Coast_key_art_600x314.jpg","slug":"the-mosquito-coast-star-justin-theroux-plucked-elements-of-his-antihero-from-family-including-the-books-author"},{"id":"47508668063402","title":"9 TV Shows You Should Binge-Watch This June","content":"Binge Guidevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})9 TV Shows You Should Binge-Watch This JuneGLOW, Luke Cage, Preacher, and Power are among the month's top binge TV offerings.by Benjamin Lindsay | June 2, 2018 |  CommentsJune has the perfect variety of action, thriller, drama, and comedy to satisfy anyone’s early summer binging palette.

Of course, such miraculous technological developments come with larger social and political consequences. Who’s really the one in power?&nbsp;Why you should watch it: Like film&nbsp;Ex Machina, HBO’s&nbsp;Westworld, and other prestige A.I. outings, Humans is a sci-fi psychological thriller for the thinking viewer. Top-notch performances and enticing plot twists will keep you glued to the screen. After over a year since the&nbsp;March 2017 finale of season 2, it finally returns with season 3 on June 5.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 12 hoursSense8  86% (Netflix)What it is: This sci-fi adventure series from the minds that brought you The Matrix follows eight strangers from around the world who are inexplicably linked mentally and emotionally as “sensates.”Why you should watch it: While the series is inherently escapist entertainment, there’s a pronounced depth to the social themes it explores across politics, identity, religion, race, sexuality, and more, and much of its adventure can ultimately be seen as allegorical to real-world issues today. While it wrapped after season 2, Netflix is bringing it back by popular demand for one finale two-hour feature finale on June 8. So grab the popcorn and get to binging!Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: Approx. 23&nbsp;hoursClaws  90% (TNT)What it is:&nbsp;Niecy Nash stars as Desna Simms, the takes-no-prisoners owner of Nail Artisans, a nail salon in the swampy town of Manatee County, Florida.

Plus we’ll take any excuse to see two-time Emmy nominee Nash&nbsp;execute her perfect blend of humor and heart. Season 2 premieres June 10.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Hulu, Microsoft, VuduCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 7.5 hoursGoliath  82%&nbsp;(Amazon)What it is: Billy Bob Thornton is a pro at playing down-and-out, so&nbsp;you’re seeing a master at work when you see him put his spin on the trope in Goliath. He stars as Billy McBride, a disgraced lawyer who’s expelled from his firm. Now an ambulance chaser, he gets his shot with a new case to enact revenge on those who took him down to begin with.Why you should watch it: Goliath creator David E. Kelley — Big Little Lies, Boston Legal, The Practice, Ally McBeal, Chicago Hope — has been attached to some of the best television series of the last few decades. Throw in Oscar-winner Billy Bob Thorton (who also won a Golden Globe for his performance here), and the result is must-watch TV.Where to watch it: AmazonCommitment: Approx. 8&nbsp;hoursThe Affair  86% (Showtime)What it is: As the old adage goes, love is a battlefield, and with The Affair, we’re here to witness some emotional warfare. The titular indiscretion comes about when Alison and Noah meet on Long Island, consummate their desires, and in turn destroy their respective marriages to Cole and Helen, respectively. The Affair&nbsp;is told through the four main players’ rotating perspectives.Why you should watch it: We know the Golden Globes love to honor a rookie series, but it’s not for nothing that The Affair swept them after its first season by winning best drama series and best lead actress for Ruth Wilson. Maura Tierney then&nbsp;went on to win for her supporting turn the following year. Dense and emotionally trying as it may be, these are all characters that you’ll fall in love with and feel for as the dissipation of their happiness and potential reconciliation plays out each week. Season 4&nbsp;premieres June 17.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 32 hoursMarvel's Luke Cage  87%&nbsp;(Netflix)What it is: While we first met Luke Cage on the streets of Hell’s Kitchen in Jessica Jones, when it came to debuting his own namesake series, Netflix brought our super-strengthed hero up to Harlem, where he’s attempting to rebuild a life after the experiment that gave him his strength in the first place went awry.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;Luke Cage&nbsp;may have been followed by a billion-dollar blockbuster film straight out of Wakanda, but that doesn’t diminish the power of seeing a black Marvel superhero on the small streaming screen. It helps, too, that it’s an excellent series full of fine performances and industry heavy-hitters like Mahershala Ali, Alfre Woodard, Rosario Dawson, and Mike Colter as the titular hero. Season 2 premieres June 22.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: Approx. 10&nbsp;hoursPreacher  87%&nbsp;(AMC)What it is: Sam Catlin, Evan Goldberg, and Seth Rogen team up here behind the camera to adapt Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon’s cult comic book about a preacher, Jesse Custer (Dominic Cooper), on a violently allegorical quest to “find God” — plus vampires, exploding holy men, extraterrestrial entities, and gun-slinging exes (played by Ruth Negga, no less).Why you should watch it: If that soundbite wasn’t at least enticing, this series is probably not for you. But if your interest is piqued, Preacher is sheer perfection. Unapologetically bloody, brazen, and bad to the bone, this series comes at the height of peak genre TV and runs with the best of them. Season 3 premieres on June 24.Where to watch it: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 17&nbsp;hoursGLOW  92%&nbsp;(Netflix)What it is: From creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, GLOW (taken from the real-life ’80s entertainment series, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling), follows a group of down-and-out actresses who unwittingly find themselves cast in a televised women’s wrestling league. Following both their personal and professional lives, it centers on Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie), Debbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin), and the man who runs the league, Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron).Why you should watch it: On paper, GLOW sounds like the kind of series that’s just so crazy it might work. Then again, it is from producer Jenji Kohan (Weeds, Orange Is the New Black). Utterly unique in the world of the half-hour dramedy, this standout series is lead by a stellar cast of kickass ladies (and even more behind the camera). Season 2 premieres in full June 29.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: Approx. 5&nbsp;hoursPower  81%&nbsp;(Starz)What it is: From creator Courtney Kemp Agboh and starring Omari Hardwick as main anti-hero James St. Patrick, Power charts James’ life as he runs a popular nightclub in New York City while moonlighting as an underground drug kingpin. How he keeps it all together while leading a double-life is just the tip of the iceberg of this series’ juicy drama.Why you should watch it: Over the course of its four seasons,&nbsp;this gritty crime drama has succeeded with a powerful ensemble&nbsp;cast providing compelling and gloriously soapy performances&nbsp; in pursuit of&nbsp;its titular vice.

Plus, we’ve got a bunch of great series returning later in the month (and in early March), so it’s the perfect time to get caught up, and there are a couple of brand new shows that will be available to stream right away. With that in mind, here are ten shows you should definitely consider binge-watching in February.House of Cards: Season 3 (2015)  73%What it is: A wily and ambitious congressman utilizes his considerable influence to climb his way up the political ladder, manipulating colleagues along the way and leaving unsuspecting victims in his wake.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey, who just won a SAG award on Saturday) is not a nice man, but he is, for better or worse, the show’s central figure. He manipulates, wheedles, gladhands, seethes, rants, negotiates, and plots behind closed doors, all to fulfill his personal vendettas. His wife, Claire (in an award-winning performance by Robin Wright) is his formidable ally through it all. Use February to get caught up on the Underwoods’ shenanigans, so you’re ready for the season four premiere on Netflix on March 4th.Where to watch: All four seasons are on Netflix, Amazon, Google Play, PlayStation Video, Vudu, and Microsoft Store.Commitment:&nbsp;36&nbsp;hours.Bates Motel: Season 3 (2015)  95%What it is: In this contemporary Psycho prequel series, a bizarre mother-son relationship between Norma Bates (Vera Farmiga) and the infamous Norman (Freddie Highmore) leads to violence and mental turbulence after moving to a small town in Oregon and opening a creepy motel.Why you should watch it: This is one of those rare prequels that actually works. Fans of the Psycho franchise can enjoy along with folks who aren’t familiar; it works as a standalone story line. The top-notch cast effectively takes stabs at subtle — and not-so-subtle — intricacies in delivery, ultimately perfecting characters designed to disturb. With season four premiering on March 7, now is an ideal time to catch up on this exploration of lives so warped, they can’t help but delight.Where to watch:&nbsp;A&amp;E TV (with cable subscription),&nbsp;Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Netflix,&nbsp;PlayStation Video, and&nbsp;Vudu, as well as on&nbsp;DVD and Blu-ray.Commitment:&nbsp;25 hours.Girls: Season 4 (2015)  83%What it is: HBO’s hit comedy about four twenty-something female friends (Lena Dunham, Jemima Kirke, Allison Williams, and Zosia Mamet) navigating life, and all it throws at them, while living in the Big Apple.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;For one person to executive produce, write, and star in a show is almost reason enough to give it a chance to win you over. Dunham wears almost all the hats behind the scenes, and drew from her own real-life experiences as she poured her blood, sweat, and tears into Girls. So far, every season of Girls has been Certified Fresh, which is no small feat. Dive in now, and you’ll be ready for the season five premiere on HBO on February 21st.Where to watch: All four seasons are on Amazon (with season one on Amazon Prime), Google Play, PlayStation Video, Vudu, Microsoft Store, and HBO GO.Commitment: 21&nbsp;hours.Show Me a Hero: Season 1 (2015)  96%What it is: Inspired by real life events and based on the nonfiction book of the same name, Show Me a Hero tells the story of the vitriolic dispute over a federally mandated order to build public housing in the middle class neighborhoods of Yonkers, NY.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;David Simon wrote, produced and created this series with Wire alum and journalist William F. Zorzi. There is no doubt Simon is amply skilled at bringing to light those things we need to see, hear and feel — and his most recent miniseries for HBO reminds us just how lucky we are to have him telling such stories. Under the direction of Paul Haggis, and anchored by an immensely talented cast lead by Oscar Isaac, Show Me a Hero&nbsp;is bingeworthy material&nbsp;of the highest caliber.Where to watch: Amazon Prime,&nbsp;Google Play, HBO Go, Microsoft,&nbsp;Vudu, and also on DVD and Blu-Ray.Commitment:&nbsp;About 6 hours.Angie Tribeca: Season 1 (2016)  89%What it is: In the vein of&nbsp;Police Squad!&nbsp;comes this hysterical slapstick single-camera police procedural spoof created by Steve and Nancy Carell.Why you should watch it: An homage to the Leslie Nielsen school of deadpan farce, Angie Tribeca satisfies with its drop-dead serious devotion to ridiculous humor. Whether it’s fake grandparents being assigned to detectives who go deep, deep under cover (with deep voices), or an officer puking upon his every entrance to a crime scene, no matter the level of the crime, fans of the silly-funny will be amused, especially with guest appearances from folks like Lisa Kudrow, Danny Trejo, and Gene Simmons. The series is currently airing on TBS, but the first season is also available to stream in its entirety, for your binge-watching pleasure.Where to watch: Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, PlayStation Video, and TBS.com (with a cable subscription).&nbsp;Commitment:&nbsp;5 hours.Broad City: Season 2 (2015)  100%What it is:&nbsp;Ilana and Abbi are twenty somethings navigating life in the big apple. Their voyages lead to an array of awkward, charmingly weird, sometimes cringeworthy and oftentimes out-right hysterical tomfoolery.Why you should watch it: Created by UCB comedian alums Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer and Executive Produced by Amy Poehler, Broad City has some seriously funny, talented women behind the show. Ilana and Abbi have dynamic chemistry and a unique humanizing brand of comedy. It’s no wonder the show has amassed loyal fans, the praise of critics — and Comedy Central’s recent order for a season four and five.Where to watch:&nbsp;Amazon, Google Play,&nbsp;Hulu, Microsoft,&nbsp;Vudu, and on DVD.Commitment: About 4&nbsp;hours.Peaky Blinders: Season 2 (2014)  100%What it is: This BBC drama, available in the US as a Netflix Original, follows the rise of the notorious Peaky Blinders gang in post-WWI England.Why you should watch it: Come for the lush production design and pulsating score — stay for the badass performances. Cillian Murphy delivers as the icy-stared leader of the hardscrabble family gang. Helen McCrory is stellar as the hard as nails matriarch and — TOM HARDY. Although you’ll have to wait for season two for it, Hardy’s turn as baker-cum-vicious gang leader Alfie Solomons is a gift from the television gods.Where to watch: Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes, Microsoft,&nbsp;Netflix,&nbsp;Playstation,and Vudu.Commitment:&nbsp;12 hours.Togetherness: Season 1 (2015)  93%What it is: A married couple struggling with relationship issues take on two new tenants: the husband’s recently evicted buddy and the wife’s recently dumped sister.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;This is the first television series created by Jay and Mark Duplass, who have worked both together and independently on a number of critically acclaimed films and TV series, ranging from Baghead and Cyrus to Transparent and The League. If you’re a fan of their typically understated, frequently poignant brand of comedy, Togetherness will feel just right. The show’s simple premise also allows its characters to breathe and behave like real people, which makes it all feel authentic and hit home harder. With its second season premiering on February 21, now’s the perfect time for HBO subscribers to catch up if they missed it the first time around.Where to watch:&nbsp;HBO GOCommitment:&nbsp;About 3.5 hours.Love: Season 1 (2016)  87%What it is:&nbsp;Gillian Jacobs and Paul Rust play a young couple experiencing the ups and downs of commitment in an adult relationship.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;There isn’t a whole lot of information available about Love at the moment, but we do know that it was co-created by Judd Apatow (alongside star Rust) and stars Gillian Jacobs, who proved her impeccable comic timing on the recent cult favorite NBC comedy Community. We also know that it will be dropping on Netflix, which has an excellent track record with original programming, and they’ve tackled similar material in Aziz Ansari’s Master of None with spectacular results. In other words, when the entire first season of Love becomes available on Netflix on February 19, you should check it out because all indications are pointing to another solid hit.Where to watch: Season one will become available on Netflix on February 19.Commitment:&nbsp;5 hours.Full House: Season 1 (1987)  40%What it is: Suddenly widowed dad Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) enlists brother-in-law Jesse (John Stamos) and childhood friend Joey (Dave Coulier) to move in and help raise his three daughters. D.J.(Candace Cameron) is the oldest at 10, followed by 5-year old Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), and toddler Michelle (played interchangeably by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen).Why you should watch it:&nbsp;The first season has the most balanced comedy, emphasizing the adult tribulations of three bachelors who grapple with the logistics of raising young girls and coming to terms with a family death. As the Olsens matured, the show played up their tubular cuteness and the humor became more slapstick and broad as the seasons wore on, though there were also frequent arcs on dating and marriage. Netflix’s Fuller House sequel, set to premiere on February 26, parallels the original with D.J., now a suddenly widowed mother of three sons, moving into her childhood home with the help of Stephanie and original series next door neighbor Kimmy Gibbler.Where to watch: Amazon, Google Play, Microsoft, Playstation, and on DVD.Commitment: 70&nbsp;hours.","section":"Binge Guide","tags":"satire, historical, and, Cannes","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01132646/FebruaryBinge.jpg","slug":"10-tv-shows-you-should-binge-watch-this-february"},{"id":"47508674126569","title":"Weekly Binge: Freaks and Geeks","content":"Binge Guidevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Binge: Freaks and Geeksby Marya E. Gates | November 20, 2014 |  CommentsOften considered one of the best “cancelled-too-soon” shows, this teen comedy-drama launched the careers of not only its creators Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) and Paul Feig (Bridesmaids), but also its young cast, including Jason Segel, Seth Rogen, James Franco, and Linda Cardellini. Here’s why you should check it out.Freaks and GeeksWhat’s the premise? Set in Michigan in 1980, the show centers around teenagers Lindsay Weir (Cardellini) and her younger brother Sam (John Francis Daley), as they navigate high school life and find peers in two very distinct groups of friends.What’s it like? It’s a period coming-of-age teen dramedy with a period-specific soundtrack, like The Wonder Years, but set in the early 1980s. Instead of the tumult of the 1960s, the Weirs are growing up in late-Cold War, not quite end-of-disco-era America. The “freaks” are the post-punks — the burnouts, outcasts, etc. — who ushered in the DYI aesthetic of the mid-1980s, while the “geeks” are computer nerds in the making. All of the teens are misfits in one way or another, trying to fit into a social group while dealing with teenage angst and a desire for independence.Where can I see it? The complete series is both available on DVD and streaming on Netflix.How long will it take? With 18 44-minute episodes, a dedicated viewer could knock the whole series out in one weekend. Even if you did one episode a day, you’d be finished in less than a month.What do the critics think? Although the show had lower ratings, it was a critical darling when it first aired, and the show’s esteem continues to grow nearly fifteen years after its cancellation. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said it was one of the few shows to “treasure youth even as it embodies all of its contradictions, craziness, hopes, and fears.” Time Magazine’s James Poniewozik listed it as one of his “All-Time 100 TV Shows,” saying, “Adolescence never hurt so good as it did in this comedy-drama about outcasts in a Michigan high school circa 1980.”Why should I watch this? Fans of any of the actors involved will get a kick out of seeing their faves so very, very young. But you don’t even have to be a fan of the cast to relate to the characters as they fumble their way towards adulthood. While the ensemble cast is rather large, their chemistry is amazing. Eschewing the “best friend” ideal most teen shows promote, Freaks and Geeks shows the fluidity of friendships — how some days you relate more to one friend, and other days to another. It also features one heck of a soundtrack, from its theme song — Joan Jett’s “Bad Reputation” — to Rush, Neil Young, Styx, and more.What’s my next step? Star Linda Cardellini was a regular on E.R. for six seasons and John Francis Delay was on Bones for seven seasons. For more coming-of-age television with killer soundtracks, try Happy Days, The Wonder Years, and The O.C. For more features from Paul Feig and Judd Apatow, try Anchorman (produced by Apatow), Superbad, Bridesmaids, and their other short-lived TV show Undeclared.See more weekly binge guides.Check out the latest TV reviews, news, interviews, and photos.","section":"Binge Guide","tags":"Network, Lifetime, Month, history, TV, space, series, universe, Television, AMC, video, scary, aapi, Oscars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Freaks-and-Geeks.jpg","slug":"weekly-binge-freaks-and-geeks"},{"id":"47508675212020","title":"Weekly Binge: Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.","content":"Binge Guidevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Binge: Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.by Matt Atchity | September 4, 2014 |  CommentsThe interconnected films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have given us an impressive list of superheroes, but it also introduced us to Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), an unassuming (but extremely effective) agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson, who quickly became a fan favorite, appears in four Marvel movies, including The Avengers, and is the central character of Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., ABC’s 2013 TV series focusing on some of the background players of the Marvel Universe.Here’s everything you need to know to catch up on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D before it returns for season two on Sept. 23.Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.What’s the premise? Following the events of The Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson assembles a handpicked team of the agency’s “best and brightest” to investigate unusual phenomena in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “But wait,” you’re thinking, “in The Avengers, wasn’t there a scene with Coulson and Loki, where Loki –” Yes, we know that scene. And Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. addresses that and a few other Marvel movies over the course of its first season.What’s it like? Early in the first season, the show feels a bit like a mystery-of-the-week spy show — a quirky team of agents solving the week’s big case while engaging in witty banter, peppered with some references to events happening in the bigger movie universe. There are a couple of references to character backstories, but the first few episodes feel like they’re missing a defining arc; despite some hints at a bigger story, each week’s immediate case takes center stage in every episode. It all starts to come together about halfway through the season, right around the time that Bill Paxton shows up as a semi-regular character. When the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier cross over into Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, the early hints and bigger stories really pay off, and you’ll be glad you stuck with the show.Where can I see it? Season one will be released on DVD and Blu-Ray September 9 and is currently streaming on Amazon Instant Video, Vudu, and iTunes.How long will it take? The first season contains 22 episodes, and each one is about 45 minutes long, so that works out to about 16 1/2 hours of TV. That’s either one marathon weekend viewing binge, or you can watch a couple of episodes a day and be done in just over a week.What do the critics think? For the most part, the critics were cautiously optimistic. Moving the bombastic Marvel Cinematic Universe to TV came with some pitfalls: The show leaves out the major superheroes and instead focuses on the movie universe’s supporting players, and on a TV budget. Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall said, “It’s… okay — quippy in that pleasingly distinctive Joss Whedon way, with a few intriguing ideas about life in a superhero world, but with a cheap look and mostly bland supporting characters.” Vulture’s Matt Zoller Seitz was a little bit more forgiving, saying “The show embraces its relative smallness, building much of the action around knowing banter and the occasional close-quarters fistfight.” But most critics echoed Christopher Orr of the Atlantic, who wrote, “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. looks ready — at least judging from the pilot — to hew a solid middle path between The Avengers and Buffy.” As a result, the first season ended up Certified Fresh at 86 percent.Why should I watch this? Clark Gregg’s Phil Coulson is one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s secret weapons. He keeps that universe grounded, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. gives him some great foils. Although the major superheroes are missing, Coulson’s fellow agents May, Fitz, and Simmons are solid characters in their own right. And if Ward and Skye are a bit bland at the beginning of the season, the show makes them a lot more interesting as the season continues.What’s my next step? If you’re late to the Whedon party, then you should try of one his many shows, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly or Dollhouse. Or if you like the idea of government agents dealing with fantastical cases, try The X-Files, Warehouse 13, Fringe or Sleepy Hollow.If you really want to get the best sense of how Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. fits into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, try this order:1. The Avengers movie2. Iron Man 33. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episodes 1 though 74. Thor: The Dark World5. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episodes 8 though 166. Captain America: The Winter Soldier7.

Sometimes, you’ve just gotta post up in front of the air conditioner between trips to the beach and enjoy a nice TV binge. That’s where we come in. With several returning sophomore series and two long-running favorites bidding adieu, there’s plenty to keep you busy this August. Catch it all below.Dear White People  95%&nbsp;(Netflix)What it is: Based on writer-director Justin Simien’s 2014 film of the same name, Dear White People takes place on a predominantly white Ivy League college campus and, through the perspective of several different African-American characters, explores and satirizes the racial tensions, microaggressions, and social injustices experienced while there.Why you should watch it: &nbsp;As funny as it is revealing, this ensemble piece for Netflix fearlessly goes where other network and primetime programs don’t dare to, not just representing the current social and political climate, but crystallizing lasting truths within it. Airtight scripts and a bevy of standout performances make the upcoming third season a must-watch for fans new and old. Season 3 premieres in full Aug. 2 on Netflix.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: Approx. 10 hours (for the first two&nbsp;seasons)Preacher  87%&nbsp;(AMC)What it is: Sam Catlin, Evan Goldberg, and Seth Rogen teamed up back in 2016 to adapt Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon’s cult comic book about a preacher named Jesse Custer (Dominic Cooper) who’s on a violently allegorical quest to “find God” — plus vampires, exploding holy men, extraterrestrial entities, and gun-slinging exes (played by Ruth Negga, no less). The series, now entering its fourth and final season on AMC, has reached comparable cult status.Why you should watch it: If the above soundbite wasn’t at least enticing, this series is probably not for you. But if your interest is piqued, Preacher is sheer perfection. Unapologetically bloody, brazen, and bad to the bone, this series came at the height of peak genre TV and to this day runs with the best of them. Season 4 premieres Aug. 4 on AMC.Where to watch it: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Hulu,&nbsp;Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 25&nbsp;hours (for the first three&nbsp;seasons)GLOW  92% (Netflix)What it is: From creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, GLOW (taken from the real-life ’80s entertainment series, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling), follows a&nbsp;pair of down-and-out actresses who unwittingly find themselves cast in a televised women’s wrestling league. Following both their personal and professional lives, the dramedy centers on Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie), Debbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin), and the man who runs the league, Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron).Why you should watch it: On paper, GLOW sounds like the kind of series that’s just so crazy it might work. Then again, it is from producer Jenji Kohan (Weeds, Orange Is the New Black), so it boasts a creative team that has a track record of doing just that. Utterly unique in the world of the half-hour dramedy, this standout series is lead by a stellar cast of kickass ladies (and even more behind the camera). Season 3 premieres in full Aug. 9 on Netflix.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: Approx. 10&nbsp;hours (for the first two&nbsp;seasons)RELATED: “Video: GLOW Stars Alison Brie, Marc Maron, and Betty Gilpin Play ‘Wrestler or Rapper’”Succession  92% (HBO)What it is: Succession is all about what happens when powerful people behave badly and — sometimes — are faced with consequences. Charting one media mogul family’s changing of the guard (with back-stabbing, side-dealing, and bribing a-plenty), the series, from creator Jesse Armstrong, stars&nbsp;Jeremy Strong, Kieran Culkin, Sarah Snook, Natalie Gold, and Emmy winner Brian Cox as the central Roy family patriarch.Why you should watch it: If HBO viewers love two things, it’s watching disparate characters fighting for a throne (hello, Game of Thrones) and extreme, dramatic family discord (Six Feet Under, The Sopranos, Big Love…need we go on?). Fortunately, the power-hungry media family of Succession has both in spades, and it boasts top-tier&nbsp;performances to match. Why else would it be recognized with a fistful of 2019 Emmy nominations, including best drama series? Catch up before season 2 premieres Aug. 11 on HBO.Where to watch it: Amazon, FandangoNow, Google Play, HBO Now,&nbsp;Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 10&nbsp;hours (for the first season)Lodge 49  93% (AMC)What it is: Set in the sun-drenched but dry-spelled locale of Long Beach, California, creator Jim Gavin’s Lodge 49 follows ex-surfer and current burnout Dud Dudley (Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn) as he tries to get his life back together by going with the flow — a fate that brings him to the adrift, philosophically-minded community of Lodge 49.Why you should watch it: What an odd little series Lodge 49 is, but if you stick with it, the magic that’s at play slowly comes to the fore and makes the experience all the more worthwhile. To say much more of the fate that’s in store for viewers of this wholly-original hour-long comedy is to do a disservice to its long-view intention, but you won’t be sorry for following Russell’s “The Dude”–esque hero to the titular lodge’s doorstep.

Those already disinclined to enjoy it saw little appeal in its early episodes, which combined Burton-esque visuals and&nbsp;Batman Begins‘ color palette into a Law &amp; Order-style police procedural. But the show weathered that storm&nbsp;— and its first year&nbsp;— to become a dependable slice of comic book television. With the series taking its final bow tonight, and introducing the Batman to its world at long last, we thought we’d take a look back at how the series found its footing and five of things it did right in the process.It Found A Remarkable Cast(Photo by Justin Stephens/Fox)Even in its roughest days, the series could boast Robin Lord Taylor, Cory Michael Smith, and a host of other actors as reasons to keep watching. Taylor, in particular, made the series’ conception of Oswald Cobblepot as a pathetic “umbrella boy” into something more than a stereotypical comic book villain. Through the years, Oswald evolved into a power player with a strange and wonderful love for his city. But Taylor always kept a little bit of the beaten-down Oswald around, allowing the scripts to make him both a menace and a joke&nbsp;— sometimes within the same scene.Even its choices for guest characters proved the show could be a magnet for great talent. Alexander Siddig and B.D. Wong proved to be great additions as Ra’s Al Ghul and Hugo Strange. That’s not to mention&nbsp;Crystal Reed as the scheming Sofia Falcone, Jessica Lucas’ long-term stay as Tabitha Galavan, and Anthony Carrigan’s take on Victor Zsasz: a darkly comic and compelling interpretation of the often-one note Batman serial killer.Oh, and we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention Jada Pinkett Smith’s contributions to the show as Fish Mooney or Drew Powell as Butch Gilzean, a man who bounced from mob boss to mob boss before becoming a compelling take on DC Comics’s Solomon Grundy.But all of those criminals and villains were able to soar thanks to the show’s backbone: a cast of heroes led by Ben McKenzie. Without the (mostly) upright Jim Gordon, Gotham would’ve floundered as it tried to find itself. And from the moment he was announced, Donal Logue&nbsp;as Harvey Bullock proved to be the casting choice even the most skeptical fan could point to and say “they got that one right.” Sean Pertwee’s Alfred soon proved to be one of the most compassionate versions of the butler ever filmed, David Mazouz carved out a place for the young Bruce Wayne, and it is hard to think of Camren Bicondova’s Selina Kyle as anything less than a heroic presence&nbsp;— even if the character tried to break out of that perception.Without the core ensemble and the choicest of guest performers, the show could never have pulled off its pivot from Batman-themed procedural to the Gotham its viewers came to love.It Embraced Mania(Photo by FOX)It became clear toward the middle of the first season that the show was most comfortable embracing the mania of its Batman characters. Oswald’s shouting, Fish Mooney going big to balance out the contained John Doman as Carmine Falcone, and even that early idea about the Red Hood infecting its wearer with a homicidal megalomania suggested where the series would go in its subsequent years. By season 3, Gotham gleefully embraced its wilder impulses.Ed’s (Smith) battle with his Riddler persona accelerated. Oswald relished his newfound leadership role in the city’s underworld, and characters like Theo Galavan (James Frain) debuted. The plots rose to match the archness of the characters. Arkham became a key location as the Order of St. Dumas, The Court of Owls, and the League of Shadows all made their plays for the city. And in each storyline, characters would reach for the rafters and do things other shows&nbsp;— even superhero shows&nbsp;— could never pull off for fear of the camp edge.Let’s consider Butch’s evolution as an example: Solomon Grundy is one of those characters you just don’t expect to see in live action. Arrow flirted with the character in its early days by featuring a version of Cyrus Gold&nbsp;— Grundy’s human name —&nbsp;but soon left it behind for a greater focus on Deathstroke (Manu Bennett). But Gotham delivered the often put-upon and generally loyal Butch into a place where his transformation makes sense. The runoff from Indian Hill serves as well as the mystical energies in Gotham’s Slaughter Swamp. In doing so, it gave Butch an in-world justification for a quasi-zombie resurrection. It led to some pretty arch things, like Tabitha pummeling the sense back into Butch. But it also continued the unexpected thread between the two of them and fueled more of the show’s operatic energy when Oswald finally put him down.Then there’s the Valeskas. Though the series toyed with our expectations in regards to Jerome’s (Cameron Monaghan) destiny from carny to killer, he proved to be a delightfully unhinged prototype Joker. The arrival of his brother Jeremiah (also Monaghan) only reinforced the need for characters and performances as large and sometimes silly as the ones employed on Gotham. Once the producers knew this was the right note, it all felt consistent.It Revitalized Barbara Kean(Photo by Barbara Nitke/FOX)If you only had the first handful of episodes of Gotham to go on, you’d expect Barbara Kean (Erin Richards) to be the first character cut from the show&nbsp;— yeah, even sooner than Rene Montoya (Victoria Cartagena) and Crispus Allen (Andrew Stewart Jones). But the series performed a magic trick with the character, breathing a wild, wonderful life into her.Introduced as Jim’s buttoned-down, high society love interest, Barbara diverged from Jim’s world diverged soon after he proposed to her. After Jason Skolimiski (Milo Ventimiglia), a serial killer known as the Ogre, brainwashed her into killing her own parents, a long-buried madness awoke in Barbara. That change to the character would sustain her for the next four seasons.She re-emerged in the second season as an unhinged x-factor, a potential proto-Harley Quinn in Theo Galavan’s Maniax (a quasi-Suicide Squad). She eventually found a stronger ally in Theo’s sister Tabitha (even though she killed Barbara that one time) and Selina. Ra’s Al Ghul resurrected her and chose her as his successor for a time, but it all went badly. That misadventure still ended with Barbara killing the Demon and ordering the deaths of every male League member. She became a territorial leader during No Man’s Land and still managed to fulfill a role given to her from comic book lore: becoming Batgirl’s mother.Through it all, the character brought a certain camp energy to the show, making her a delight to watch. Ra’s Al Ghul may have been correct in his assessment — no one in Gotham City likes her&nbsp;— but we loved her. We loved her enough, in fact, that we always wanted to see her get her comeuppance, but also sighed with relief every time she stayed the hand of death itself.It Made Leslie Thompkins A Marquee Character(Photo by Jeff Neumann/FOX)First debuting in 1976’s Detective Comics #457, Dr. Leslie Thompkins was introduced as a family friend who comforted young Bruce on the night his parents were murdered and as a defender of the less-fortunate kids living near Crime Alley. Across the decades, she would become one of Batman’s confidants, but almost always a special guest character. She might matter for a storyline&nbsp;— like the time she faked Stephanie Brown’s death to prove a point to Batman&nbsp;— but she generally drifted back to Crime Alley (or Africa), out of sight and out of mind from the reader.But Leslie proved to be a character ripe for the Gotham treatment. First appearing as a guest character (played by Morena Baccarin) halfway through the first season, the almost immediate flirtation with Jim Gordon&nbsp;— and their ability to work well on cases together&nbsp;— proved too irresistible for the producers to ignore. She was a regular character from the second season onward, even when sensibility or death itself would suggest it was time to leave Gotham. And where Barbara’s path through town was a straight line, Lee’s (as the series would dub her) path proved to be a rubber band.At first as caring and altruistic as her comic book counterpart’s initial appearances, an arrogant streak emerged when she married into the Falcone crime family. Things only got worse when Jim killed her husband, Mario, in self-defense. But in infecting herself with the Alice Tetch Virus, she learned a truth that led her out of Gotham a second time (she first left after Jim was sentenced to life in prison and she miscarried their child). She soon returned to run a clinic in the Narrows (more shades of her comic book counterpart), where she eventually became its benevolent leader and started a relationships with Ed. It led to their deaths, but they both got better thanks to Nyssa Al Ghul (Jaime Murray) and her plans for the No Man’s Land Gotham. In the end, she married Jim.The series took the handful of ideas about Leslie Thompkins spread across 30 years of comics and made them a fantastic, soapy saga of one woman denying her heart. Sure, a lot of people had to die before she would accept Jim’s marriage proposal, but this is Gotham after all, where crime lords get to have happy endings.It is also the sort of show in which Lee could wheel an in-labor Barbara down a disused hospital corridor while Barbara shoots a bunch of goons in the face, leading to the two characters finally bonding after almost five full years of tension.It Tested The Nobility of Jim Gordon(Photo by FOX)In designing a Batman show without Batman,&nbsp;Gotham looked to Jim Gordon to fill the hero role. And on television, heroes get their convictions tested on the regular. Where Batman can out-muscle and out-think any threat to his worldview, Jim can only take those punches and weather those storms.And boy, did Gotham test him. From a green detective on a police force rife with corruption to commission of a city in need of some serious rebuilding, the show kept finding new ways to sweep Jim’s legs, shoot him in the shoulder, and encase him in darkness, like that time Lee buried him to make him take the Tetch Virus.But through it all, Jim always found his way back to his moral center. Sure, he made bad deals with people like Sofia Falcone and Oswald, but those decisions would prove to Jim that he could never take the convenient path. Consider just how few concession he gave during No Man’s Land: Even with resources dwindling and rival warlords chomping at the Green Zone, Jim managed to stay true to his ideals. He also managed not to kill Ed when he was revealed as the person who blew up Haven. Would Jim have had that strength without all the previous experiences, kidnappings, back-door deals, and Oswald’s attempts to be his friend? It may not have all gone smoothly, but Jim managed to save the city from tearing itself apart without the Batman.In fact, he proved you can do a Batman show without Batman. Despite the Dark Knight being the hero Gotham deserves, Jim proved one mostly good cop can hold the line as well. It makes sense. He was the first supporting character creators Bill Finger and Bob Kane introduced into Batman’s world and has had the same 80 years to develop. But Gotham allowed him to take a journey as harrowing and as dark as any his future friend would embark upon, and he is now a richer character for it.Nonetheless, as the series finale airs tonight, let’s see what the Batman can do in his&nbsp;single&nbsp;Gotham appearance.The Gotham series finale airs Thursday, April 25 at 8pm. on Fox.Like this?

Starting next Monday, Legends airs in place of Supergirl, which will in return in April. To some, the split-scheduling suggests a loss in confidence in The CW’s strangest superhero show. But according to CW President Mark Pedowitz, its audience is incredibly loyal and followed the show from its original Thursday night slot to Tuesdays. Presumably, they will be there for the Monday night move as well.But if you walked away from Legends, here are six reasons to give the show another chance.1. It Righted Its CourseIf you walked away, chances are it occurred during or near the end of the first season. And even the most dedicated fan of the series will admit its first year was a rocky beginning. The romance between Carter Hall (Falk Hentschel) and Kendra Saunders (Ciara Renee) was one of the weakest in the entire Arrowverse. The season-long fight against Vandal Savage (Casper Crump) – a worthy opponent on paper and in the comics – failed to create much momentum.But the second season removed those elements and found a new premise for the show: a group of misfits tooling around time and getting into trouble. All the while, they are chased by a charismatic group of villains and the man who teamed them up in the first place. The soft revamp focused the show while giving it a greater freedom to play with the time travel element with lively visits to the Old West, the 1940s, and even the Stone Age. A new romance between newcomers Nate Heywood (Nick Zano) and Amaya Jiwe (Maisie Richardson-Sellers) worked in ways the Hawkes never did. But perhaps the most important change to the show was adopting the devil-may-care attitude of Mick Rory (Dominic Purcell), the semi-reformed pyromaniac and thief. Suddenly, traveling in time was fun.2. Nate Heywood and Ray Palmer – History Bros!And no two characters adopted that sense of fun better than Nate and Ray Palmer (Brandon Routh). Nate was introduced as an archeologist, but his fanboy enthusiasm consistently disarmed his researcher’s eye, leading to even bigger changes to the timestream than the Legends hoped to avoid. But almost always at his side to squee when meeting people like George Lucas and King Arthur is Ray, a clever scientist who also can’t help but want to be at a Comic-Con as long and as deep as history himself.In that Camelot episode — which turned out to be the creation of a timelost superhero — Ray reveals his admiration for the time to Sir Galahad. When the knight is later killed in a sneak attack, Ray offers to take his place despite Nate revealing that a “Sir Raymond of the Palms” suddenly appeared in the Arthurian legend and is fated to die on the battlefield. While it seems Ray’s childhood wish gets the best of him, he heeds Nate’s words and wears an extra layer of protection during the fated battle against.Shortly thereafter, the two find themselves on the set of a low-budget sci-fi movie assisting George Lucas. The two could not be more thrilled as Star Wars inspired Ray to study the sciences and Indiana Jones led Nate to the path of anthropology. But when their fanboying scares Lucas into quitting film school, they suddenly lose all knowledge of their original pursuits.Its clever turns like the this which makes the show a rewarding watch week after week. But not every moment boils down to goofing off in time; and Legends knows how to switch to seriousness.3. Sara’s Journey to CaptainOver the course of the first two seasons, Sara Lance (Caity Lotz) the undead Canary of Arrow fame went from reckless brawler with a bottle of Jack Daniels in her hand to a competent team leader. Original team captain Rip Hunter (Arthur Darvill) later claimed that was his intention from the start, but it also looks like a happy accident as time often plays tricks on him. The end result for Sara is a role she was meant to have, but could never find in the Star City of Oliver Queen&nbsp;or in the League of Assassin’s stronghold in Nanda Parbat (although she has made her way there to recenter herself once or twice).But the toughest moment for Sara occurred when she learned her sister Laurel (Katie Cassidy) was killed at the hands of magician Damien Darhk (Neal McDonough). When a younger Darkh emerged as their enemy, it took everything in her power to avoid assassinating him and wrecking the timeline. The fact she resisted it despite a couple of good opportunities to avenge Laurel prove she has grown a great deal since her post-resurrection impulsiveness. Granted, she can still be impulsive from time to time.That sort of character growth can be seen in the Firestorm pair of Jax (Franz Drameh) and Martin Stein (Victor Garber). Still strangers for the most part when they got aboard the Legends’ timeship, they were definitely family by the end of their story earlier this year thanks to body-swapping, repeated encounter with Stein’s younger self, and a dangerous rescue from a Soviet gulag.But something has to motivate all this time travel, and it typically emanates from the Legion of Doom.4. The Legion of DoomNamed in honor of the Super Friends’ antagonists, season 2 brought Darhk, Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman), and the Reverse-Flash (Matt Letscher) together under a common goal: claim the Spear of Destiny and rewrite their pasts. Though the term “Legion of Doom” was met with derision by Sara when Nate and Ray first used it, Darhk himself fell in love with it, which is key to understanding the villain’s role on Legends.McDonough, who returns this year as Darhk following the events of Arrow’s fourth season, delights in his villainy. Unlike the darker or more complicated big bads like Zoom (Teddy Sears and the voice of Tony Todd) or Clifford DeVoe (Neil Sandilands), Darhk enjoys himself. He was that way on Arrow as well, but as they voice of the opposition, he brings an energy Savage lacked in Legends‘ first season. Also, Darhk’s sense of fun is infectious. Malcolm Merlyn starts to laugh more and even when the pair are trying to stab each other in the back, there’s a good-natured sense about it.But the Legion of Doom can be a serious threat. Reverse-Flash, desperate to stop a time-wraith from erasing him, was all business until he was seemingly victorious. And Darkh’s partner this year — the unseen Mallus (voiced by John Noble) — is not the quippy confrere Malcolm Merlyn was last year. Yet, in balancing that sense of menace with a shot of glee, the Legion of Doom manages to be the most engaging set of villains around.5. It’s Consistently FunnyBut what sets Legends apart the most is its willingness to be funny. Where The Flash occasionally remembers it was originally the show with the lighter tone and shrinks Cisco (Carlos Valdes) and Ralph (Hartley Sawyer) to LEGO minifig size, Legends will set an entire episode around Christmas turning into an Odinsday celebration thanks to a timelost Christmas gift named Beebo. It even uses the “Merry Christmas” greeting to determine whether or not the team saved Christmas or bungled things up worse.It got worse before it got better.Another recent episodes saw a young Ray Palmer (Jack Fisher) living out the plot of E.T.: The Extra-terrestrial with deadly Dominators instead of a benevolent mushroom creature (or whatever E.T. is supposed to be). The jokes come fast as Nate finds himself attracted to Ray’s mother; which the shape-shifting Dominator matron uses against him. Also, newcomer Zari (Tala Ashe) openly mocks the team’s costumes despite putting one on herself.Though Mick Rory’s complicated relationship with his father was explored during a trip to the Vietnam War recently, his cutting remarks and permanently affixed beer bottle are always a guaranteed laugh. But his drinking habit also led to television’s only funny intervention as an alternate reality version of his old friend Leonard Snart (Wentworth Miller), pointed out his chemical dependence. Mick’s attempt to go cold turkey underscores Purcell’s comedic chops and the show’s ability to find a comedic edge in its darker elements.6. Wally West And John Constantine Are Stopping ByConstantine fans will be happy to know that Matt Ryan is making another appearance as the trench-coat-wearing magician and grifter. This time, he needs Sara’s help to exorcise a demon who happens to know her name. If the show is bringing the team to an asylum with Constantine, you know you can expect at least two extended Exorcist jokes.And in the weeks ahead, Wally West (Keiynan Lonsdale) debuts as a permanent fixture on Legends. Criminally underused on The Flash since season four began, Wally’s unfortunate also-ran (pun intended) status makes him a perfect addition to the team. He and Nate are already friends, as seen in the first episode of Legends‘ third season. He is also a dependable fighter, as seen in 2017’s “Crisis on Earth-X” crossover event. His speedster powers also set him apart from the motley assortment of gadgets, powers and fighting prowess aboard the Waverider.DC’s Legends of Tomorrow is definitely the breeziest of The CW superhero shows, but its mix of humor, pathos, ridiculous plots and character growth also makes it the closest thing to reading a late-1980s or early-1990s comic book. The team is also fun to be around as they experience the very same thrill viewers get by seeing Julius Caesar incite a bunch a frat bros into crossing the Rubicon. Well, it was really Aruba in 2017. You kind of had to be there.And if you weren’t, there’s never been a better time to give Legends of Tomorrow another shot.DC’s Legends of Tomorrow returns Monday, February 12 at 9/8C on The CW.","section":"Comics on TV","tags":"Century, indie, Swim, Peacock, The, robots, comic, awards, binge, universal, documentaries","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/08175808/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-600x314.jpg","slug":"6-reasons-to-give-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-another-chance-2"},{"id":"47508714539100","title":"All Kevin Smith Movies, Ranked By Tomatometer","content":"(Photo by Weinstein Company/Courtesy Everett Collection)All Kevin Smith Movies RankedThe story of Kevin Smith making his first movie starts out like the story of most indie filmmakers following a dream in the ’80s and ’90s: Maxing out credit cards, risking financial ruin all in sheer tyranny of belief that the majorly groundbreaking screenplay you wrote is your ticket into the business. Smith’s story ends differently than most: He actually made it.‘Twas the right time, right place (unlike all those contractors on the Death Star) for Smith’s Clerks. Audiences and studios alike were hungry for outsider voices, and the guy from New Jersey holding a scuzzy black-and-white comedy was as outsidery as you can get. Released the same October week in 1994 as Pulp Fiction, Clerks set a new high for those aiming low, and thus the American independent movement of the ’90s was born.Smith’s next movie, Mallrats, showed he was serious about giving voice to pop culture nerds, slackers, and stoners, throwing more references to movies and more reverence to comic books, to the point of roping in Stan Lee as a sage, secondary character. Smith had his most promising leap forward in writing and direction with Chasing Amy, and then took on a more aggressive front against the status quo with the iconoclastic Dogma. The organized religion send-up featured a growing cadre of stars willing to yuk it up in Smith’s unified Askewniverse (like Matt Damon, Salma Hayek, Alan Rickman, and Chris Rock), with Jason Mewes and Smith himself as Jay and Silent Bob a consistent, comedy presence. (Check out our oral history of Jay and Silent bob with Smith.)The two characters were upgraded to lead status with Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, before Smith returned to his roots in Jersey Girl and Clerks II. With the Judd Apatow style changing the comedy landscape, Smith stuck his own thumb into the pie, mixing extreme raunchiness and sweet sincerity in Zack and Miri Make a Porno.The 2010s began with Cop Out, a failed stab at Hollywood big-budget action filmmaking, and an experience Smith now openly derides. Red State just edged by with enough critics for a Fresh rating, and would begin a 3-movie string operating in horror. Tusk has its defenders. Yoga Hosers definitely does not. For his latest, Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, Smith hit the streets, doing roadshow screenings with Q&amp;As city by city. Not only did that bring together his fans in community, but also played up Smith’s strengths as a world-class raconteur, whose gift of gab has helped him create an empire of podcasts and review shows, overshadowing his directing career in recent years. His next movie is horror-comedy Killroy Was Here, scheduled for a 2020 Fall release.

Though busy with the show, Lively was still able to turn in a few memorable appearances in films, like the Certified Fresh crime saga The Town, and Green Lantern, where she would meet future husband Ryan Reynolds.Though Gossip Girl ended in 2012, it would be several years before her film career would resume in earnest, starting with the romantic fantasy The Age of Adaline. But it would be shark movie The Shallows that would propel her to movie stardom. 2018’s A Simple Favor, where she goes tête-à-tête with Anna Kendrick, was another critical and box office hit. In her latest movie, 2020’s The Rhythm Section, Lively goes on a one-woman mission to take down those responsible for a plane crash that killed her family.

Apted took over directorial duties after the first installment, 1964’s 7 Up, and released a new installment every seven years without fail, up to 2019’s 63 Up. Roger Ebert called the project “an inspired, even noble, use of the film medium.”Beyond the social intimacy of his documentaries, Apted navigated the studio corridors respectably, specializing in dramas and thrillers. Coal Miner’s Daughter, Gorillas in the Mist, Enigma, and Amazing Grace represent some of the best of this work, and Apted even entered blockbuster territory with the James Bond entry The World is Not Enough&nbsp;and took a crack at Narnia with The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.And now we look Michael Apted’s movies ranked by Tomatometer.#24Incident at Oglala (1992) 100%#24Adjusted Score: 100.814% Critics Consensus: No consensus yet.Synopsis: Michael Apted's documentary examines the 1975 slaying of two FBI agents in Oglala, SD, which resulted in the arrest and...

Macy); and espionage entanglements (Killers, starring Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1212410[/tomatometer]Get Him to the GreekIt might seem like fun to hang with your favorite rock star – unless you actually have to do it. The critics say Get Him to the Greek takes this inspired premise and wrings plenty of terrific gags from it, making for a film that has such high energy that its lapses are easy to forgive. In this quasi-sequel to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Jonah Hill stars as a low-level record company employee who’s been given a daunting assignment: get a crazed, hedonistic rock star (Russell Brand) to show up on time for his band’s 10-year reunion show. Naturally, everything goes haywire as Hill finds himself in the midst of his target’s wild lifestyle. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Get Him to the Greek may not be the most disciplined comedy in the world, and it gets a little mushy at the end, but for the most part, this is a raunchy, clever, and deftly-acted good time. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down our favorite cinematic party animals.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1208173[/tomatometer]SpliceGiven our collective anxieties about both childbirth and cloning, a movie like Splice is sure to touch a nerve. And critics say this sci-fi/horror flick is a creepy and provocative piece of work – even if it doesn’t completely live up to its fantastic premise. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley star as a pair of biochemists who craft a new being by combining human DNA with a miasma of animal features – and must confront the moral and practical ramifications of their creation. The pundits say Splice has an ice-cold, queasily compelling look, and is smarter and more philosophical than your typical horror fare, though it’s hampered by an uneven tone and a middling conclusion.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1226669[/tomatometer]MarmadukeMarmaduke has been in the funny pages since the 1950s, so it was inevitable that the gigantic, implicitly savage pooch would eventually wind up on the big screen. Unfortunately, critics say there’s precious little to chew on here, despite the presence of some talented actors. Marmaduke (voiced by Owen Wilson) finds the titular Great Dane on the run after an embarrassing mishap with his new masters, who hit the road to find him; hilarious talking-dog hi-jinks and romance ensue. The pundits say this is strictly juvenile fare padded to feature length, with little to delight kids or their parents.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10011824[/tomatometer]KillersIt appears the folks behind Killers don’t believe their film will slay with the critics, since it wasn’t screened prior to release. Jen (Katherine Heigl) is a lonely gal who’s just met Spencer, a guy who seems to be too good to be true; naturally, it turns out he’s a secret agent and she’s about to get caught in the line of fire.

Hood vs Evil, with voice work from Hayden Panettiere and Patrick Warburton). What do the critics have to say?Fast Five 77%Action sequels are always mercenary cash-grabs, and by the time a fifth installment hits theaters, any pretension to quality has pretty much evaporated. Right? Not necessarily, if the reviews of Fast Five are anything to go by — critics say this installment delivers high-octane thrills and rarely pauses for thought, leaving the sporadic success of the first four films in the dust. Once again, ex-cop Brian O’Conner (Paul Walker) and ex-con Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) team up with a bunch of their old comrades to participate in a daring street race (this time in Rio) while staying one step ahead of the law. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Fast Five is borderline avant-garde in its refusal to adhere to logic or the laws of physics, but that’s one of its strengths — the action sequences are breathtaking, and a sly sense of humor and breakneck pace keep things from ever getting stuck in neutral.Prom 35%Given that it’s a Disney release, one can safely assume that Prom won’t delve into the ribald, risqué territory that many associate with (or remember from) prom night. And while critics say this sweet, good-natured comedy has its virtues — among them an appealing young cast — it’s really, really predictable, and a little too squeaky-clean. The film follows Aimee Teegarden and a group of her friends who are trying to plan out every detail necessary for the perfect prom. However, sometimes real life intrudes on even the best laid plans, and soon friendships are tested and nerves are frayed. The pundits say Prom is generally better than it has to be, offering a wish-fulfillment fantasy that’s sincere and non-threatening, but it’s also clichéd, lighter-than-air fluff. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down memorable movie proms).Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs Evil 11%Hoodwinked didn’t exactly set the world afire, but a few critics found its Little Red Riding Hood-meets-Rashomon conceit charming and sporadically funny. Now comes Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs Evil, and critics say whatever modest pleasures were to be found in its predecessor have been steamrolled by middling animation and played-out pop culture references. Hayden Panettiere steps into the role of Red, who’s joined a paramilitary group and is tasked with rescuing Hansel and Gretel from an evil witch. The pundits say Hoodwinked Too! is weighted down by corny wisecracks and sub-par animation, stranding a talented voice cast in a kiddie flick that’s unlikely to delight tots or their parents.Dylan Dog: Dead of Night 7%It appears that the folks behind Dylan Dog: Dead of Night knew their flick was a dog, since it wasn’t screened for critics prior to its release. Brandon Routh stars as the title character, a private investigator whose clients include werewolves, vampires, and zombies, all of whom are ready to duke it out if our hero can’t track down a mysterious artifact.

What do the critics have to say?Steve Carell has patented a very specific type of character: One who bristles with unearned self-confidence, fecklessness, and occasional decency and competence. Who better to update the role of Maxwell Smart, the most clueless of secret agents? Well, critics say Get Smart benefits from Carell’s screen persona, but falters when it delves into action territory. Stepping into the role made famous byDon Adams, Carell is Maxwell Smart, an overeager and under-qualified spy who’s recruited along with the lovely Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to take down KAOS, a sinister organization bent on world domination. The pundits say Get Smart is amiable enough, buoyed by a solid cast (includingDwayne “The Rock” Johnson,Alan Arkin, andTerence Stamp) and some solid laughs. But others complain it devolves into a generic action flick, missing the sharp satire of the original show. At 52 percent on the Tomatometer, Get Smart missed it by that much. (Check out pics from the Get Smart premierehere.)“I knew we should’ve taken that left turn at Albuquerque.”After a long hiatus from live-action comedy, Mike Myers is back, playing a New Age spiritualist in The Love Guru. The critics’ advice to Myers: Heal thyself. An American raised by gurus in India, Pitka returns to North America to establish himself in the self-help game; his first undertaking is to help a hockey star heal from the wounds of a recent romantic breakup. The critics say The Love Guru is relentlessly juvenile, wasting a solid collection of players (including Jessica Alba,Justin Timberlake,Ben Kingsley, andVerne Troyer) on shticky comic set pieces that lack rhythm or wit. At 13 percent, The Love Guru is less than enlightening. It’s also one of the worst-reviewed films of Myers’ career.“Welcome to Being John Malkovich, LLC.”Also opening this week in limited release:Kit Kittredge: An American Girl, starringAbigail Breslin as a plucky Depression-era girl who solves a mystery and saves her family’s house in the process, is at 68 percent.Expired, a dark indie comedy starringSamantha Morton andJason Patric as parking meter officers in love, is at 75 percent;And Brick Lane, the story of a Bangladeshi woman who experiences culture shock after an arranged marriage brings her to London, is at 60 percent.“You can still get a job after Batman &amp; Robin!”Recent Mike Myers Movies:————————————-42% — Shrek the Third (2007)89% — Shrek 2 (2004)12% — Dr. Seuss’ the Cat in the Hat (2003)14% — View From the Top (2003)55% — Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002)Recent Steve Carell Movies:———————————–78% — Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who!

Jackson); a disgruntled hunchback (the CGI Igor, with voice work by John Cusack and Molly Shannon); a haunted dentist (Ghost Town, starring Ricky Gervais and Greg Kinnear); and a date from hell (My Best Friend’s Girl, starring Dane Cook and Kate Hudson). What do the critics have to say?Say what you will about the films of Neil LaBute, but give him this: while he rarely delivers a fun time at the movies, he’s no slave to convention. Unfortunately, critics say Lakeview Terrace offers an intriguing setup before devolving into a routine thriller finale. Samuel L. Jackson stars as a strict, emotionally damaged LAPD who objects to his new neighbors’ interracial marriage; after extensive harassment, the young couple (played by Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington) fights back. Pundits say the problem with Lakeview Terrace is that it presents a realistic, charged scenario before jumping the rails in the final act, substituting smart characterization with generic vigilante tropes. At 36 percent on the Tomatometer, you may not want to visit Lakeview Terrace.“Ugh, Sam’s at it again…. chewing the scenery at three in the morning…”It’s one thing to make a macabre children’s film; it’s another to make one that doesn’t deliver much entertainment. Critics say the film is something of a Frankenstein’s monster, stitching together recycled parts from Shrek and The Nightmare Before Christmas. The titular hunchback (voiced by John Cusack) is tired of being a lowly lab assistant; he wants to be an evil scientist in his own right. But when one of his creations, a monster named Eva (Molly Shannon) turns out to be really sweet at heart, Igor begins to rethink his priorities. While the pundits say Igor has moments of Tim Burton-esque visual invention, it’s a pretty mediocre affair, filled with shopworn pop-culture references and manic action but few laughs; plus, it’s probably a bit too dark for the wee ones. At 20 percent on the Tomatometer, Igor could use more brains.“You too can have your very own Contour Chair.”Ricky Gervais is a very funny man, but thus far, his movie career has consisted of supporting roles. However, with Ghost Town, the man who brought so much cringe-worthy wit to The Office and Extras takes center stage — and the pundits say the result is delightful. Gervais stars as Bertram Pincus, who has a near-death experience and discovers he can see ghosts — and they’re pretty annoying, especially the caddish Frank (Greg Kinnear). But those specters are of some help, as Bertram learns to be a better person — and find love in the process. The pundits say Ghost Town is a perfect fit for Gervais’s talents, and the film emits awkward laughs and warmth without devolving into schmaltz. At 84 percent on the Tomatometer, Ghost Town has plenty of blithe spirit. (Check out this week’s Total Recall for a ghoulish compendium of some of our favorite cinematic apparitions.)“For the last time, I am not pug-nosed!”Given that it wasn’t screened prior to release, it’s unlikely critics will be BFFs with My Best Friend’s Girl. Dane Cook, Kate Hudson, and Jason Biggs star in this romantic comedy about a guy who’s so obnoxious he convinces potentially straying women to stand by their men — before falling for his main homey’s boo.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1207149[/tomatometer]The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, from 1974, was a stylish mix of comedy and thrills that, despite its reputation, is just dated enough to warrant a remake. However, critics say that Tony Scott‘s take, while slick and hyperkinetic, lacks the grit and cool of the original. John Travolta stars as Ryder, who takes control of a New York City subway car and its passengers, demanding a hefty ransom. Meanwhile, subway dispatcher Garber (Denzel Washington) tries to thwart Ryder’s plot. The pundits say the film is well-acted but has little sense of economy or patience; it’s a well-made but empty exercise. (See our feature “A Hundred Years of Heist Films,” in which we break down the caper genre by decade.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190964[/tomatometer]Imagine ThatImagine That has an intriguing premise, especially in these economically tumultuous times: what if a child’s fantasy world could predict the ebb and flow of the stock market? Unfortunately, critics say Imagine That does little with its setup, despite solid work from Eddie Murphy and newcomer Yara Shahidi. Murphy stars as Evan Danielson, a financial advisor who spends little time with his daughter. That changes when he discovers that her drawings and imaginary friends appear to have a preternatural understanding of the investment world. But will Evan learn to become a better dad? The pundits say Murphy is admirably restrained, and Shahidi is a natural, but the film around them is only sporadically amusing; it’s also overly gimmicky and predictable. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Murphy’s best-reviewed films.)Also opening this week in limited release:Youssou N’Dour: I Bring What I Love, a documentary about the great Senegalese singer and his attempt to bridge the musical divide between the sacred and the secular, is at 100 percent.Food Inc., a doc about corporate control (and the lack of governmental oversight) over the food industry, is at 95 percent.Moon, starring Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey in a dark thriller about corporate skullduggery on the lunar surface, is at 90 percent.Sex Positive, a doc about the complex life and times of gay health activist Richard Berkowitz, is at 67 percent.Blast!, a doc about a team of tenacious scientists and their search for the origins of life on Earth, is at 60 percent.Francis Ford Coppola‘s latest, Tetro, starring Vincent Gallo as a man living in Buenos Aires and haunted by his past, is at 50 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"comic, Nominations, Pirates, Annual, 99%, book, adaptation, Tarantino, worst, mission:, TNT, who","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Pelham-1-2-3-Doesnt-Quite-Take"},{"id":"47508801373035","title":"Critics Consensus: Who‘s Better, Who‘s Best; Never Goes Down; Guess Doomsday‘s Tomatometer!","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Who's Better, Who's Best; Never Goes Down; Guess Doomsday's Tomatometer!Summarizing the critical voice on this week's movies.by Tim Ryan | March 13, 2008 |  CommentsThis weekat the movies, we’ve Seussian silliness (Dr.Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who!, starringJimCarrey and Steve Carrell), mixed martial arts madness (Never Back Down,starring Sean Faris andDjimon Hounsou), and apocalyptic action (Doomsday,starringRhona Mitra). What do the critics have tosay?Virtually no one denies thegenius of Dr. Seuss’ books, but it’s been an open question whether theircompact, staccato whimsy could be translated into feature-length films; theresults thus far have been middling (How the Grinch Stole Christmas, 52percent on the Tomatometer) to poor (The Cat in the Hat, 12 percent).However, critics say the CG Horton Hears a Who is easily the mostSeussian Seuss feature, and therefore the best. Horton (JimCarrey) is anelephant who stumbles across the microscopic Who-ville; he promises to protectthe tiny inhabitants, despite ridicule from his fellow pachyderms. The punditssay Horton is filled with deft animation, solid voice work, valuable lifelessons, and good cheer — and if the runtime is a little padded, the moviestill maintains the enchanting, thoughtful spirit of Seuss’ books. At 74 percenton the Tomatometer, Horton may be a cut below the animatedHow theGrinch Stole Christmas (100 percent), but it’s still cause for Who-bilation.(Check out co-director JimmyHayward’s favorite animated filmshere.)“…And this is our lolcat wing.”Never Back Downis yetanother film in which a wayward teen learns about martial arts — and life —from a stern-but-caring teacher. Wasn’t Ralph Macchio in a movie like this a fewyears back? Perhaps, but critics say NBD is still a reasonably involvingtake on old material. The movie starsSean Faris as an unmoored, ill-temperedyoungster who, after being humiliated in a fight with a classmate, learns mixedmartial arts under the tutelage ofDjimon Hounsouand, in the process, how to better focus his bluster. Pundits say Never BackDown‘s premise may be old as the hills, but pundits say it’s made with moreskill and panache than the material would indicate. At 36 percent on theTomatometer, the critical reception to Never Back Down puts the “mixed”into mixed martial arts.

What do the critics have to say?Affleck as George Reeves romances Lane’s Toni Mannix, wife of MGM studio head Eddie Mannix.More than a whodunit, \"Hollywoodland\" explores fame’s transience and the price paid in pursuit of it. The focus of this cautionary tale is George Reeeves (Ben Affleck), a struggling actor who finds notoriety as the Man of Steel on the ’50s TV series \"The Adventures of Superman.\" Much to his dismay, kryptonite for actors turns out to be unemployment, as he finds it difficult to get roles because he’s so well known as Superman. His torrid love affair with the wife of MGM’s studio chief doesn’t help his cause, either. His death, caused by a bullet to the chest, remains shrouded in mystery: Was it suicide or murder? Critics say the movie doesn’t quite fly with its lumbering narrative, but the performers are in top form. As of this writing, \"Hollywoodland\" has a Tomatometer of 68%.Say hello to my little friend…Tony Jaa is out for revenge in the actioner \"The Protector.\" Traveling from his native Thailand to Australia, he seeks those responsible for killing his father and kidnapping his elephants.

What do the critics have to say?A Secret Service agent is determined to save the president from an assassination attempt. It’s a setup that has worked successfully before (\"In the Line of Fire\"), but critics say \"The Sentinel\" isn’t sharp enough to make good on its premise. Michael Douglas stars as the agent who falls into a web of intrigue, and Kiefer Sutherland, who’s getting pretty good at foiling conspiracies, plays his protege. Critics say the film is slick, but a bit too convoluted to really work. At 26 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Sentinel\" is not very well-fortified.What is \"American Dreamz?\" Is it a comedy? A satire? An ambitious attempt to capture the zeitgeist of our politically divided, entertainment-craving times? More to the point, is Paul Weitz‘s latest any good? In parts, the critics say, but not as a whole. \"American Dreamz\" tells the story of a recently re-elected, now intellectually curious president (Dennis Quaid) who makes a guest appearance on a popular TV singing competition where would-be songbirds and would-be terrorists convene. The critics say \"American Dreamz\" is a bit too ambitious for its own good, and lacks the sharp bite to really work as satire. At 38 percent on the Tomatometer, this one may not be the stuff that \"Dreamz\" are made of.We’re guessing that the people behind \"Silent Hill\" would consider the little girl on the poster to be the perfect movie critic for one reason: she’s got no mouth. And there isn’t anything for the critics to say, because, like a bunch of other movies this year (all of which have turned out to be critical duds), \"Silent Hill\" was not screened for the scribes.

In what seems to be becoming a familiar Hollywood story, Watts was discovered following an independent film of his that made a splash when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.The name of the film is Cop Car, and Watts’ honest and grounded handling of the film’s young leads is what put him on Marvel’s radar for this latest take on the well-known webslinger – one that would find Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, back in high school, navigating the complexities of coming of age while also having super powers.“What’s important is to just try to remember what it was like to be that age,” Watts told Rotten Tomatoes. “For me, it was like if I was 15 and I could do what Peter Parker could do, that would be so much fun. That would be so amazing, and there’s no way around it. Drama will come and dramatic things definitely happen in the movie, and there’s a lot of awesome action and all of that. But fundamentally, I wanted to approach this from the perspective of enthusiasm and excitement.”Watts devoured every coming-of-age movie he could get his hands on while prepping to make Spider-Man: Homecoming, and when Rotten Tomatoes sat down with him to discuss his Five Favorite Films, the director insisted we stay on theme, natch.Here, then, are the Spidey director’s five favorite coming-of-age movies.The 400 Blows (Les Quatre cents coups) (1959)  100%I would say that’s the first quintessential coming-of-age movie. It felt so real, and it just captured the freedom, danger, fear, hope, and everything that comes with being a kid. It’s one of the best movies ever made. It was such a shock to the world when it came out, too, and it was, like, “Oh, wow. You can make movies like this?” It stands up, too.Leolo (1992)  90%This is a really obscure one, but there’s a really weird French-Canadian movie called Leolo. Roger Ebert loved it. He gave it a four-star review when it came out. The filmmaker, Jean-Claude Lauzon…&nbsp;He made two movies and then he died. It’s a really tragic story. It’s this surreal, messed-up story about a kid whose family is going insane, and so he comes up with these fantastical stories to escape from his world. I saw that movie when I was in high school, and it just made such an impression on me because of the way it balanced humor and absurdity, and surrealism, and then just tragedy. It’s great. I should probably see it again. I haven’t seen it in a couple of years, so I want to make sure it still stands up. That movie is another very particularly strange coming-of-age movie that will always be a reference for me.Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)  90%Welcome to the Dollhouse is great. Even though it’s about a girl in middle school, to me, that feels like the most honest reflection of what being a kid around that age feels like. It’s just so bad. It’s like that movie captures the very worst moments of being that age so perfectly. Everything is unfair, everyone hates you, and the world is totally against you. It’s such a good coming-of-age movie.River's Edge (1987)  88%I love River’s Edge. River’s Edge is one of those movies like… I grew up in Colorado. When I saw it, I was like, “That’s more like where I’m from than a John Hughes movie.” It’s like seeing that, and then seeing Gummo. That feels more like where I’m from than Can’t Hardly Wait.Mazes and Monsters (1982) This one isn’t a high school movie, but more a college-age movie. It’s called Mazes and Monsters and it stars Tom Hanks. It’s about the dangers of role-playing games, and if you play these role-playing games, you’ll lose touch with reality. Tom Hanks is a kid who gets too into their version of Dungeons and Dragons, which they call Mazes and Monsters. He loses touch with reality and thinks he really is on the quest, and disappears into New York City. His friends have to try and find him. It’s definitely worth checking out if you can find it. It might be one of those movies that just disappeared. I think it was a made-for-TV movie, but it’s always affected me. I saw it when I was a kid on the Saturday afternoon matinee movie, and it just has this ending that is so bleak that I’ll never forget.According to Watts, he hopes Homecoming will serve as a launching pad for more Spider-Man stories that, like the movies mentioned above, are honest and respectful of what it’s like growing up, but also captivating and wildly exciting because, well, Spider-Man!Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;opens everywhere on&nbsp;Friday, July 7.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Trek, Review, Classic, movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/06161118/Jon-Watts-FFF1.jpg","slug":"spider-man-homecoming-director-jon-watts-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508816178192","title":"Yuen Woo-Ping’s Five Favorite Fight Scenes","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Yuen Woo-Ping's Five Favorite Fight ScenesThe legendary fight choreographer of The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and director of Master Z: Ip Man Legacy reflects on his own work.by RT Staff | April 12, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by VCG/Getty Images)You may not immediately recognize Yuen Woo-ping‘s name, but if you’ve seen the Matrix movies, the Kill Bill movies, or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, then you’ve seen his work. The renowned martial arts director and fight choreographer has orchestrated some of the most memorable and thrilling action sequences in all of cinema, working with people like Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Michelle Yeoh, and Donnie Yen. Some of his films, like Iron Monkey, Wing Chun, and the original Drunken Master, are widely celebrated classics of the genre, which has benefited from his talents for nearly half a century.This week, Yuen releases his latest directorial effort, a spinoff of the popular Ip Man franchise called Master Z: Ip Man Legacy. The film focuses on a martial arts master in 1960s Hong Kong who loses a duel with Ip Man and decides to retire, only to be drawn back into fighting by a local drug dealer. Normally, we would ask Yuen what his Five Favorite Films were, but with such an extensive list of credits, we thought we’d do something a little more interesting. With that in mind, read on for Yuen Woo-ping’s five favorite fight scenes that he himself directed.Master Z: Ip Man Legacy (2019)  89%The Sign FightThis one is from my most recent film so it’s still fresh in my mind. The idea was to do a fight completely at height on the signs on our Hong Kong street set. We designed the sequence for months as the wire work with that many people was especially complicated. It was all done off real buildings, nothing was done in a studio. We were hesitant to commit to this sequence because we were shooting in the middle of typhoon season and we were worried the wind would destroy our set and we would not have time to rebuild and would have to scrap the sequence midway through. In the end, we took a chance and the heavens watched over us and we finished the sequence three days early.Iron Monkey (2001)  91%Paper CatchingThough not really a fight, this sequence of grabbing papers caught in a wind has a special place in my heart. It’s one of the times where we take all the martial arts know-how and use it on a character moment without combat. A beautiful little scene.The Grandmaster (2013)  78%Train Station FightHero fights with two people are the most fun to choreograph and probably also the most entertaining to watch. This film was a long time in the making – almost three years. The actors trained hard to learn martial arts and it all shows in this scene. Zhang Ziyi’s bagua and Max Zhang’s xingyi are on full display and we incorporated the best moves from each style. It was the perfect culmination of martial arts, hard work, and cinema.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2001)  97%Tie: Night Chase and Dojo FightThe film is regarded as a classic but many people were skeptical when Ang Lee wanted to make this film. We really pushed ourselves on these two sequences. The Night Chase sequence not only had to have the actors flying on rooftops, but the cameramen as well. Combined with Tan Dun’s drums, the sequence is as thrilling to watch as it was to make.The Dojo Fight was a fun sequence. Ang Lee wanted a fight with “everything” so we used every weapon we could think of. Even though there are a couple comedic beats in the sequence, it really showed how powerful the Green Destiny sword was in the story.Drunken Master (Jui kuen) (1978)  79%Final FightThis was my second film as director and it was made in same style as my first film, Snake in the Eagle’s Shadow. I got to work with my father, who first got me into filmmaking. Since I was still just starting out, the budget and schedule were very tight. And at that point, people were still figuring out the kung fu genre, so we were really left to figure things out on our own. All the hard work paid off and the film was a huge success in Asia. It made drunken boxing popular again to the point where wushu started practicing it again. It made Jackie Chan a star and it got me work for years to come.Master Z: Ip Man Legacy&nbsp;opens in limited release on Friday,&nbsp;April 12.Like this?

When we recently chatted with Moss about her Five Favorite Films, she initially limited her choices to movies about relationships — a major theme in her new film — but as we spoke, we discovered another common thread throughout them. See the full list here:&nbsp;Annie Hall (Woody Allen, 1977; 98% Tomatometer)The first one is Annie Hall. All of these movies are movies that… I mean, I feel that most people’s favorite movies are movies that you can see over and over again. That’s just a movie that, you know, I don’t know how many times I’ve seen it and it doesn’t even matter anymore. It’s one of those movies that, every time it comes on TV, I have to sit down and watch it even if I’ve seen it before. To talk about why I love it, I mean, what do I even say? “Because I’m not a moron [laughing]? That’s why I love it?”That’s a good reason. I like it.OK, good, we’ll go with that. “Because I’m not a moron.”Do you remember when you first saw it?No I don’t. I’ve no idea when I first saw it, no idea.But you watch it over and over again? Every time it’s on?For sure. It’s definitely something that, yeah, in fact, just talking about it is making me want to watch it.You mention relationships in your upcoming film. What is it about the relationship in Annie Hall that is attractive to you?It’s such a real relationship, you know. I mean the first thing I love about Annie Hall is the humor. It’s just hilarious. It’s a really funny movie. But it’s a very real relationship story and one of my favorite moments is the montage at the end when he goes over all the great moments that he and Annie had. And it’s just that great kind of, like, even after a relationship goes south and you break up or whatever happens, I just love that, the way he looks at it and goes, “Yeah there were a lot of good moments though [laughing].” It has this really, weirdly positive ending.When Harry Met Sally (Rob Reiner, 1989; 88% Tomatometer)That’s a film that, for me, that’s one that, even more than Annie Hall, is like an I-know-every-word kind of movie, you know, that I just can’t get over. It’s very comforting to me. It’s one of those comfort films. And it’s also really funny. And it’s one of those movies like… All the things about these romantic comedies and relationship movies or whatever, they don’t even make them like that any more, you know? Except for independent film. Independent film sometimes does, but you don’t really see them.Yeah, the styles change, even on television. Everything is changing. And I think what happens is sometimes we get kicked back, we revisit what we enjoyed about previous decades and we see a new variation come up again.Yeah, yeah. Totally.Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950; 98% Tomatometer)This is a film — and this is kind of going away from this relationship theme — but this is a film that, when I was little, I loved. I mean, I’ve loved it my whole life. I don’t know what that says about me, but I loved Sunset Boulevard. I was a big old-movie fan when I was, you know, older than most people should be when they’re older-movie fans. [Gloria Swanson is] just so spectacular in that film and it sort of formed my idea of that raw, dramatic acting. And the writing… The writing in that movie is unbelievable. So many incredible one-liners. It’s one of those movies that you can watch now and you’re just, like, “Damn, that was a good line,” you know? Like, God, that was some good writing back then. The thing is that movies written that way wouldn’t fit in, really, these days. It would sound strange, like you couldn’t really do it now. But thank God we have them.Sweet Smell of Success (Alexander Mackendrick, 1957; 98% Tomatometer)Another movie I’m going to give you is the same thing. I mean, it’s just that the writing is unbelievable, and that’s Sweet Smell of Success. It was a movie I discovered a little bit later, like maybe in my teens. And that was another move that I was just like, “Jesus, the writing on this thing, it’s unbelievable.” The one-liners are so smart, you know? I loved movies like Sunset Boulevard and I loved the kind of Hitchcock films and all of these kind of things and then I saw Sweet Smell of Success and I was like, “Oooh, this is a little bit naughtier,” you know what I mean? There’s something a little bit darker about that movie. The performances in it are so priceless. It was a little bit more of a leap in the cinematography, I think, than maybe those of, like, Sunset Boulevard or something. The lighting, it was very harsh. They were doing things with the cinematography that I was like, “Ooh, this is naughty,” like, “You’re not supposed to do that.” You know?So you do have a bit of a dark side.Yes for sure, for sure. But I mean mainly it was the writing, that is what attracts me to the older black and white classics.All About Eve (Joseph L. Mankiewicz, 1950; 100% Tomatometer)I know I’m kind of sticking in an era. I’m sorry. I know I could probably go to cooler areas like the 1960s and 1970s and stuff.That’s what you like, though.Yeah, I mean those are the films I can watch over and over again that I’ve loved since I was a little girl. All About Eve probably preceded all of those movies. I definitely saw that first. That started my love affair with Bette Davis. It kind of introduced me to what an actress was. Bette Davis was my first introduction to what an actress was, like a real actress, you know? And I subsequently saw all of her movies. I was obsessed with her when I was a little girl. That ballsy, confident, beautiful but flawed woman. She’s strong, but vulnerable. I felt like the characters she played, the later ones, have all of that, and that, to me, is like, “Oh that’s acting.” Even though it’s probably a lot broader than what we do now, and it’s obviously a different style. To me, Bette Davis was like, “Oh wow, that’s an actress, I get it.”And there’s so much truth in that movie, it’s a little scary.Oh my God, completely, completely. And it’s a brilliant script. And again, incredible dialogue. Just full of the most iconic lines. All of these movies… rarely do we have movies these days where you can quote, like… I’m not talking about “I’ll be back” and “Show me the money,” know what I mean [laughing]? I’m talking about really intelligent, quick-witted one-liners. And these movies have, like, 30 of them in every movie.Right; they don’t make movies like that now.They probably couldn’t. It probably would be weird and outdated. It would be strange. I mean, you probably couldn’t anymore, but it’s ok because we can just go watch those.True, and hope that people stop remaking everything.Exactly, exactly.Not sure if you realized, but four out of five of your picks here have an entertainment theme.Oh, that’s true, I didn’t. [Laughing] I didn’t, because I’m a moron, but you’re absolutely right.No, you’re not a moron, remember? Because you like Annie Hall.[Laughing] Because I like Annie Hall, exactly. Thank you.You were obviously drawn to these sorts of films when you were a little girl and now, here you are, doing so well in your career.For sure, for sure. Yeah, I definitely was attracted to things that had an entertainment theme to them, and musicals and things about Broadway and all of that kind of thing, I definitely was attracted to.Listen Up Philip is currently in theaters in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"america, Winter, Shudder, Series, Marvel, Walt, Pictures, 93rd, mission:, franchise, child's, miniseries, crime, technology","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Elisabeth-Moss-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"elisabeth-moss-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508829586581","title":"Breaking Bad Star RJ Mitte’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Breaking Bad Star RJ Mitte's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | March 2, 2016 |  Comments(Photo by Getty Images / Jesse Grant / Stringer)&nbsp;RJ Mitte&nbsp;rose to awareness as Walter White, Jr. in Breaking Bad. While Mitte’s own case of cerebral palsy is less severe than that of the character he played, he serves as spokesperson for several organizations devoted to helping people&nbsp;with disabilities — including actors and others in the media. He also keeps up with his acting career, as evidenced by his most recent film outing,&nbsp;Who’s Driving Doug.&nbsp;Mitte talked to us here at Rotten Tomatoes about five of his favorite movies — a choice selection of action and sci-fi. You can see if the films that excite him get you excited too:Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%All these stories piling together and crossing over — I think that is the simplicity of life — these five degrees of separation that divide us all. I think it was a great cast of people; it’s a good story. Films that I enjoy are films that tell stories and not necessarily on the bounds of believable, but in life, anything can happen. I like action films. I guess Pulp Fiction is fairly&nbsp;violent, but I’m an action film kind of guy. It depends on what I’m in the mood for when it comes down to it.The Crow (1994)  83%The first one with Brandon Lee. The whole set — it was a really cool set — I liked the whole vibe of it with the martial arts. I was a Brandon Lee fan, and that was a fairly bad-ass movie. That whole Hell’s Kitchen vibe in New York — that whole realm just has this cool mystifying vibe. It looked like it would be a fun set.Serenity (2005)  82%I watched Serenity before Firefly [the TV series it was based on]. In 2000, binge-viewing wasn’t something that we did; we didn’t have access to that. If you missed a TV series, you just missed it. Or you’d record it on your VHS, right? It was a chore. In 2002 I was more of a country boy; I was always outside. But I like the whole idea of Serenity, the whole world, that outer rim world that we imagine that one day we will be [part of]. I actually felt this wasn’t too far out of our limits. You look at that ship, and it’s a junky old beat up ship. You would think after a thousand&nbsp;years, we will have things like that — that will fly and that will do things like that. We do. We have shuttles and they don’t look too far off [from those]. [That world is] only going to get closer into our grasp.The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)  95%I feel like at one point or another, this is everyone’s favorite movie. Danny Elfman is amazing. I’m a big fan of stop motion. I really have an admiration and appreciation for [it]. I think they do such an amazing job, and they take so long to make. It’s almost flawless. You can’t even tell that they’re fake toys. It looks like animation. I like the music; it was amazing. Danny Elfman always does it with his scores, and Tim Burton is really rad. It’s done so well for the time. That’s a movie that will come around every so often that will just hang in the air and will never — no matter how good the graphics get, or how good your TV gets — at the end of the day, it&nbsp;will never folly. There are some things you’ll put on and go “It looked like that?” But when you watch Nightmare Before Christmas, you know it never gets bad or old. The music is always amazing, and they worked really hard. And that rings through. Stop motion is so great.Training Day (2001)  73%The vibe of it —&nbsp;I always felt like this was an all-around bad-ass cop movie. I could try to go into detail about certain things about it that stood out to me, about how it all takes place in one day and how he sets him up throughout the whole day. It was done right. It was one of those movies that was just set up right.&nbsp;Who’s Driving Doug&nbsp;is now showing in limited release and on premiere Video-on-Demand.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Mindy, AMC, binge, Now, Marvel, sitcom, Larson, BAFTA, Schmidt, Us, female, crime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/29142702/mitte-rep.jpg","slug":"breaking-bads-star-rj-mittes-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508837171413","title":"Joan Rivers’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Joan Rivers' Five Favorite FilmsThe veteran comedian reveals why she's unable to speak in front of Joan Collins.by RT Staff | September 5, 2014 |  CommentsThere’s nobody quite like Joan Rivers. She began her career in show business during the 1950s, paying her dues on the comedy circuits of the ’60s until she landed a breakthrough appearance on The Tonight Show. From there, Rivers went on to host a couple of her own talk shows, appear on popular TV sitcoms, record Grammy-nominated comedy albums, write best-selling books, establish a line of jewelry, and work on some film roles to boot. Despite her now divisive yet ubiquitous presence at high profile industry red carpet events, she is an entertainer through and through who has managed to remain successful despite personal tragedies and a few career missteps. This year, Rivers became the subject of a poignant documenatry, Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work (Certified Fresh at 91%), which chronicles a year in the life of the veteran comedian and reflects on her lengthy career in Hollywood. She was kind enough to take time out of her busy schedule to provide us with her Five Favorite Films, and they are anything but ordinary. Read on for the full list.Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work (2010,91% Tomatometer)This is by far the best documentary I’ve ever seen about a sensitive, beautiful and sexual artiste! It delves deeply into the age-old mystery of why, for some reason, everyone who meets her, hates her. They are so wrong! Go see Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work for yourself, and send me a present.Empire of the Ants (1977,0% Tomatometer)Two words: Joan Collins. There’s nothing sexier than a young Joan Collins being dragged by giant ants into an underground cave to toil as their slave. I’ve never able to ask her about her performance because I’m in awe. When I meet her I start, but I get as far as “Empire of the…” and then I’m simply in awe.Can’t Stop the Music (1980,8% Tomatometer)I love musicals, and so one that features the Village People AND Bruce Jenner is my kind of movie. Bruce didn’t do much else, but where can you go from there? It’s like the guy who wrote the Bible, where are you going to go? Margaret Mitchell had the good taste to get hit by a car. She knew she could never top Gone with the Wind.The Bad Seed (1956,87% Tomatometer)I love an evil child murderess with perfect, bleached blond hair. It just appeals to me.Rabbit Test (1978,N/A)This is the only movie I ever directed and I’m proud to say that it finally got its first good review after 34 years! Otherwise, it wouldn’t have made this list.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"satire, Prime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Joan-Rivers-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"joan-rivers-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508844238099","title":"Five Favorite Films with Anna Kendrick","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Anna KendrickThe Pitch Perfect star also chats about her new movie, her love of cinema, and understanding a cappella geekdom.by Ryan Fujitani | October 5, 2012 |  Comments(Photo by Jason LaVeris/Getty Images)Every once in a while, a few young actors and actresses emerge who help reassure us all that Hollywood is in good hands. Anna Kendrick, whose latest film Pitch Perfect expands into wide release this week, belongs on that short list. After securing a supporting role in the continuing pop culture phenomenon that is The Twilight Saga, Kendrick went on to nab an Oscar nomination for her superb work alongside George Clooney and Vera Farmiga in Jason Reitman’s Up in the Air. That breakout performance led to roles in widely praised films like Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and 50/50, and while she currently appears in three movies out in theaters, she has yet another — Robert Redford’s The Company You Keep — set to open in November. In other words, she’s doing pretty well for herself.Last week, RT chatted with Anna about Pitch Perfect, in which she plays an aspiring electronic music producer who joins her college’s all female a cappella group and helps turn the team into a winner. But first, of course, she gave us her Five Favorite Films, and being that she’s a huge movie fan, we think you’ll enjoy the variety in her choices.The Women (1939)  94%This has been my favorite film since I was twelve years old. I’m pretty sure I could recite it in its entirety. It has a wildly funny all female cast and a female writer. I revisit it almost every year and my appreciation for the performances and the writing grows.Hot Fuzz (2007)  91%When I first saw this in the theater I remember laughing my ass off and then realizing it was also the best action movie I’d seen in a long time. I love that it’s a love letter to action and not a spoof. It also has some of the best and fastest comedic dialogue ever.Wet Hot American Summer (2001)  38%The first time I watched this movie was with a group of friends who are obsessed with it. I asked to watch it again the following three nights. It’s absurd, it has the most amazing cast, and it’s infinitely quotable. It’s a perfect desert island movie.Nattvardsgästerna (Winter Light) (1962)  73%I love all the Bergman films I’ve seen, but this spoke to me personally in a really profound way. I remember feeling very shaken after watching it. I feel like the greatest thing a writer or filmmaker can do is say something so honest that most people wouldn’t be brave enough and that’s what I love about this film. The characters are deeply flawed and sometimes very ugly to each other, but that’s why it’s so effective.Love and Death (1975)  100%I know this is not the best Woody Allen film I’ve ever seen, but it’s still my personal favorite. Only Woody Allen could mix highbrow Bergman homages and Marx Brothers-esque slapstick. I also love how much fun he seems to be having with the great Diane Keaton. If only there were a blooper reel.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: Let’s talk about Pitch Perfect. You’re obviously a big movie lover, which is interesting because your character here, Beca, is kind of a movie Grinch. Skylar Astin’s character Jesse wants to score films, and he tries to share some of his favorites with Beca, and your reaction to it is “Meh.” But you’re not like that at all…Anna Kendrick: No, it was a funny thing where I almost thought, “This person isn’t real. A person who doesn’t like movies doesn’t actually exist in the world.” But then there have been people on Twitter who are like, “Oh, I don’t really like movies, but I’m going to check out your new movie!” I’m just like, “Where did you come from?” It’s like saying you don’t like music. It’s baffling!RT: When did your love for the movies start?Kendrick: When I was twelve, my dad started showing me some classic movies. So I had a basic education of classics from the ’30s to the ’60s, I guess. Not a ton of them, but that era of filmmaking — it’s kind of wide, but that feels really cozy to me. That feels like home base. And I know that, for most people, if they had to pick an era, it would be the ’70s, but for me, all the visual language of the ’40s feels like home to me.RT:&nbsp;In Pitch Perfect, one of the movies that plays a particularly key role is John Hughes’s The Breakfast Club.Kendrick: Yeah, I saw that movie a little late. I saw it probably when I was 18 or something. It was one of those movies where I felt like such an idiot because I had obviously heard about it for years and years. And then you see it and you’re like, “This is great!” and you feel like you’ve discovered something because it’s so great and you want to tell your friends about it, and they’re like, “Yeah, we know, idiot. We’ve been telling you to see it forever.” That same kind of thing happened with Terms of Endearment, and it’s like, “Oh right, there’s a reason that The Breakfast Club and Terms of Endearment are some of the most popular movies of all time.”RT:&nbsp;Which of the kids in The Breakfast Club do you think you most identify with?Kendrick: I suppose Ally Sheedy. I was kind of just a drama nerd. That was my world when I was in high school. I would like eat lunch in the auditorium and hang out with all those kids all the time.RT:&nbsp;You knew pretty early on that you wanted to act…Kendrick: Yeah, I started doing theater at around six, and my parents exposed me to a lot of different stuff, like soccer and rock climbing and academic stuff. Performing was just the thing I came back to again and again. Who knows what was going on in my psychology at that age, but that’s what I enjoyed.RT:&nbsp;Right, and a lot of people might not know this, but you performed on Broadway at a young age and even got a Tony nomination for it, so the stage has been a part of your life for a long time. With that background in mind, do you sort of jump at opportunities like Pitch Perfect where you can showcase your singing ability?Kendrick: You know, with this one, it felt more like just being able to sing is a nice trick to have up my sleeve. It’s a nice thing to have on my resume, as it were. But for me, the thing that I loved about this script was everything surrounding the singing. I think it could have been a cappella, it could have been chess club, it could have been math club. You know, I think it’s about the way that, even within a really geeky subculture, there are gods, there are rock stars, and I think that’s the case with everything. I thought a lot about King of Kong when I was reading this script. So to me, it actually had nothing to do with music in this particular case. If anything, I just knew that was going to make the filmmaking process harder. I was just really drawn to Kay Cannon’s writing and her voice; I think 30 Rock is the best show ever made, and I was just excited about this script.RT:&nbsp;Based on your experience, is it more difficult to rehearse for a stage production and then do it live in one shot, or is it more difficult to capture that same live theater energy when you’re shooting a film about stage performance?Kendrick: I think the latter. I insisted that any time I sing alone in the movie that I got to do it live, because I just think that you, as an audience member, can feel when it switches over to a pre-recording. I understand that, obviously, with the nature of some of the musical numbers, you just have to pre-record it, but as far as when I’m singing on my own, it’s not too complicated and I trust myself to be able to show up and do my best, better than I could in a recording studio, really. So every time I open my mouth when I’m on my own in the movie, I’m singing on set.RT:&nbsp;Here, you’re also surrounded by a lot of other talented people as well. Did you guys form bonds specific to your individual groups?Kendrick: Well, I think we all bonded. You know, the girls, seven out of ten of us came from just an acting background, and even though we all came to the table with some level of singing ability, we didn’t come from this world, and I think eight out of the ten guys came from this world, so we were just so impressed with them. Only three of our girls had experience in the a cappella world, but a lot of the guys were from the collegiate a cappella world. I tried to hang out with those kids as much as possible to try and have it rub off on me. They had so many ringers in their group, and their energy and their work ethic was really infectious.RT:&nbsp;And how familiar were you with that world before the movie?Kendrick: When I was 18 — that’s when I first moved to LA — a friend of mine had a crush on a guy in an a cappella group, so I got dragged to this competition between UCLA and USC, and they had a bitter rivalry. I thought it was going to be the most excruciating night of my life, but by the end of it, I’m like on my feet and I want to meet them, I think they’re the coolest, and I’m like starstruck by them. And once again, that was something I was thinking about when I read the script, which is like, that’s absolutely true the way that these kids shouldn’t be cool, and outside of their little world they’re not cool, but within it, the stakes couldn’t be higher.RT:&nbsp;There’s a relatively wide variety of music used in Pitch Perfect, and your character is a budding electronic mashup artist. How closely did the music in the movie match up with your tastes? Like, with your background, are you a showtunes girl or…Kendrick: I’m kind of an everything girl. I feel like, you know, in the grand scheme of things, my musical tastes are probably pretty pedestrian. I’m not going to pretend I’m like all up on the music scene. But there’s obviously a lot of pop music in this movie and I think it works and it gets the job done.One of the moments I really love is… Any time I get to embarrass this character, because she thinks she’s so cool, which she’s not — she’s an 18-year-old girl who’s mad at her dad, you know; she’s not a cool girl and she has no right to think that she’s above these other more obviously dorky girls — and so I love that she has like a shameful, secret Miley Cyrus love. That moment was really, really funny to me and said a lot about her character. You know, I think Beca sees herself as sort of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and I think it was really fun for me to break her down. I think that’s when the audience gets on her side, is when they realize she’s not actually “too cool for school.” She’s secretly weird just like everybody else.RT:&nbsp;That’s actually when I knew the movie had gotten to me, was when I found myself swaying in my seat to Party in the USA, of all things. But this is a good example of the movie blending its musical strengths with comedy, and Pitch Perfect has a lot of funny moments, thanks to a really great cast with surprisingly good chemistry. A lot of people are talking about Rebel Wilson, who’s fantastic, but Hana Mae Lee, who plays Lilly, also had some hilarious one-liners, for example.Kendrick: Yeah, obviously Rebel is like the MVP of the movie, no question, but we’ve got amazing people scattered throughout. Hana Mae Lee in real life is the funniest person, has the sweetest personality, and then when she goes into this Lilly character, it’s like her whole face changes, you know what I mean? It’s not just how she delivers her lines; it’s like, I see a change in her, physically, the second that she’s Lilly from when she’s Hana.RT:&nbsp;Here, you sort of anchor the movie as the “straight man,” so to speak, but you’ve always displayed impeccable comic timing throughout your career. When you got into acting, did you see yourself fitting so well into comedic roles?Kendrick: It’s hard to say. You know, I started so young. It’s interesting because I think… Like, Katherine in 50/50 ended up getting a lot of laughs, but she isn’t a funny character. So I guess I didn’t think about it as one way or the other, like the fact that Beca’s a straight man. I played her the same way that I played Katherine; it’s just that one of them turned out to be really funny. Does that make sense? It’s like one of them came out funny because she didn’t know she was funny. So it’s not like I’m hitting for big laughs, yeah.RT:&nbsp;Do you have a preference between doing more dramatic roles and funnier ones?Kendrick: I guess I’m drawn to… I think, even when I read serious scripts, the moments that I connect to are the little glimpses of humor, because, you know, I think every script, no matter how serious it is, has bits of humor in it. Even End of Watch is really funny. So those are the moments where I can kind of see what I can do with it that’s different, and I feel like that’s the easiest way for me to get inside a character’s head, is through the humor, like what sense of humor they have.RT:&nbsp;In the 2003 movie Camp, which was also a musical, the character you play makes another character vomit on stage, and then it happens here in Pitch Perfect, too. So this must happen all the time during stage performances, right?Kendrick: Oh my god, I hadn’t put that together; that’s so interesting. Well, a lot of people in choir pass out. That happens a lot. I bet if you YouTube that, there will be a veritable cornucopia of kids passing out, because you stand with your knees locked, and you’re nervous, and you’re using your diaphragm. I’m sure there are a couple vomit videos out there, but I’ll bet you there are a lot of passing-out videos. When I grew up doing choir, I felt like once every performance, some girl or some guy went down. But it’s never happened to me, thankfully.Pitch Perfect expands nationwide this week, but you can also catch Anna in Paranorman and End of Watch, both Certified Fresh and in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"stoner, the, monster, Vudu, Emmys, CW, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/19174607/Anna-Kendrick-2012-FFF1.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-anna-kendrick"},{"id":"47508854445420","title":"Five Favorite Films with Sofia Coppola","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Sofia CoppolaPlus, the Oscar-winning writer-director chats about her latest film, Somewhere.by Luke Goodsell | December 27, 2010 |  Comments“I never expected to win a prize for anything for my films,” says writer-director Sofia Coppola, who won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 2004 for Lost in Translation and whose latest, Somewhere, recently took home the Best Picture prize at the Venice Film Festival. When RT caught up with her recently, the quiet, modestly spoken Coppola seemed humbled by the attention, preferring to talk about vintage camera lenses and sound-mixing Ferrari engines rather than the Awards-season circus.Indeed, the image that opens Somewhere — Stephen Dorff’s Hollywood drifter doing laps in his Ferrari in the desert — was the impetus for the film. “I imagine these guys with sports car collections, they have to bring it to some track outside the city to have to be able to drive them,” says Coppola, “so I imagined him in the middle of nowhere, kind of going around in circles, to introduce the state he’s in. I started with him and the Ferrari, and then I thought about the Chateau Marmont and the stories of people I knew, or things I’ve heard, around there, and sort of put them all together.”“I pictured Stephen early on, just as kind of this lost, bad boy LA actor,” the director continues. “I just felt like he was the right guy for the part; I’d met him and I knew him over the years and I always thought he was a good actor.” It’s a subtle, affecting performance from Dorff, whose character — a bored actor adrift in the purgatory of his own fame — comprises a lot of wordless, long takes. “Stephen’s so sweet that I felt like that would help make you care about watching the character,” says Coppola. “He’s so flawed that you could easily not be interested, but I felt that he’s got so much heart that he could connect people to it.”Curiously, Coppola shot the film using old Zeiss lenses once used by her father, Francis. It’s perhaps ironic that Coppola senior is now once of digital’s biggest advocates, and at one point had even wondered why his daughter would want to film on archaic stock. “I think he appreciates it now,” she laughs, “but I remember he and George Lucas a while back saying, ‘Oh, you have to start shooting on digital — why are you using film?'”Well, that explains the first of her five favorite films…Rumble Fish (1983, 70% Tomatometer)I love that it’s an art film about teenagers. I just love the way that it’s shot — I love those old lenses, those Zeiss lenses; they have a softer feel. [Coppola and her DP, Harris Savvides, used the lenses from Rumble Fish to shoot Somewhere.] Roman [Coppola, her brother] and I are just sentimental about film.Breathless (1960, 96% Tomatometer)The Godard version. [On the similarities between the moving car jump cuts in Somewhere:] I guess I was going through that whole New Wave thing… coming from a documentary background.Sixteen Candles (1984,87% Tomatometer)That was one of my favorite films when I was growing up, and I’ll still watch it every time it’s on.Lolita (1962,97% Tomatometer)I love Kubrick. I love the way he put that film together, the way it’s filmed. Just some of the shots he did there, like the reverse shot in the car window with the monster.The Last Picture Show (1971, 100% Tomatometer)It’s just a beautiful film.Somewhere is in theaters this week.

One might also be surprised to discover that, after some acting and a solo singing career, Wiedlin reunited with her bandmates to tour, at age 42, once again as the Go-Go’s. This month, the band kicked off their “Happily Ever After Farewell Tour,” and Wiedlin released the first issue of Lady Robotika, a comic book starring herself as an alien-abducted rocker who is turned into a cyborg and forced to perform music. Sound intriguing? We thought so, and decided to chat with Wiedlin about her favorite movies and what it was like working on the comic. Read on for the full interview!Blade Runner (1982,94% Tomatometer)#1 for sure is Blade Runner. I’ve been a big sci-fi geek since I was a little kid, and it was just done so well. It felt like that’s what Los Angeles was going to look like in the future, and you felt Harrison Ford’s turmoil as a blade runner. Everything about it was so real, and so cool, and everyone that was cast in it was so good in their roles, and so attractive. Even though the future looked spooky, it was also mesmerizing. Sean Young… Who knew she was so crazy? She was so great in that movie. And then when she finds out she’s a replicant, it’s so heartbreaking. I could watch that movie a hundred times and I don’t even care which version I see; I’m fine with the narration, I’m fine without the narration. It’s just a great movie. When you’ve seen it so many times, I guess it doesn’t matter. Like, it’s impossible for me to go back in time and see it for the first time without narration and see if it would have made it confusing or not, which, I guess, was the studio’s worry, that people wouldn’t be able to follow the storyline. But, you know, I’ll never know. [laughs] All I know is it’s the best science fiction movie ever made.Showgirls (1995,13% Tomatometer)#2 is Showgirls. Again, a movie I’ve seen at least a dozen times, and I know that everybody gets it now, but I was a true believer right from the beginning. It is, really, the accidentally funniest movie I’ve ever seen. It never gets any less funny. There’s just something about watching Elizabeth Berkeley in that role, when she’s like flopping in the water like a fish, or when she’s in that club, and Cristal Connors pays her $500 to give Zack a lapdance, and she’s all flapping around on his lap. It’s so cringeworthy, but it’s so funny at the same time. And I’m normally not really a fan of cringey humor — shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm — I can’t even watch those shows because I end up running behind the couch, I’m cringing so bad. The thing about Showgirls, and how earnest everybody was, and how over-the-top it was — I just love that movie. I practically have it memorized.Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back (1980,99% Tomatometer)I think #3 would be The Empire Strikes Back. To me, clearly the best of the six, like way, way ahead of the field — the six Star Wars movies, not my list — and here we go, Harrison Ford again. Harrison Ford was like my generation’s greatest leading man. He’s going to be our Clark Gable or whatever. He was so good. That movie just had plenty of story and action, and my problem with a lot of sci-fi is that it’s all action and not enough story, not enough character development, and not enough relationships between the characters. It’s all shoot-em-up, which is good; I think guys like that. But I like my shoot-em-ups with relationships and character development and lots of story. And, you know, lots of snappy lines done really well by the actors. Another thing is, it’s the last Star Wars movie before the cute came in. And once they brought the cute, it was like “Ugh! It’s too cute!” They should have made six movies for adults and six movies for kids, and then everybody could have been happy. I’m going to get death threats now, for criticizing… I kid because I love! [laughs]Star Trek IV – The Voyage Home (1986,83% Tomatometer)The next one would be Star Trek IV, because it was the best Star Trek, and because I was in it. [laughs] Does it count as a plug if it was made a million years ago? I mean, it was the best Star Trek, so there you go. And it was about saving whales, which I would agree with, and it was the first time that they really let the characters get kind of funny and more relaxed, and I think that was a really good direction for them to go.Galaxy Quest (1999,89% Tomatometer)#5, I’ll put Galaxy Quest. I know Galaxy Quest is not a great movie, but I love that movie, and I’ve seen it over and over and over, and I still love it just as much. I think Tim Allen portraying a Kirk-like character is so damn funny. I think that’s one of the best “fan” films ever made. And the fake Spock guy was great, yeah. That movie’s really funny. We saw it when it first came out — my family has a tradition of always going to a movie on Christmas afternoon, and we went and saw that one. It was such a great family moment, too. It brings back good memories.Next, Wiedlin talks more about her love of sci-fi and what it’s like to work on a comic book.RT: So let’s talk about Lady Robotika. What inspired you to create a comic book? It seems like a new direction for you.Jane Wiedlin: It is a really new direction, because I didn’t read comic books as a kid. But I’ve been going to conventions for years now, mostly to sign autographs as a celebrity, and then sometimes as a fan, just because I’m a sci-fi geek. But I kind of ignored the whole comic book thing, and it’s pretty overwhelming at a convention anyway. I mean, I’ve seen literally millions of comics there, and you’re like, “Well, where do we begin?” But as a kid, I wasn’t a huge fan because I read really fast, and the comic books would just end for me before they started, so I didn’t find them satisfying. When I met my writing partner Bill Morrison at Super-Con two years ago, we became really good friends really quickly, and he suggested doing a project together. And, you know, he’s Mr. Comic so it was his idea to do a comic, and I was really intrigued by the idea. When he suggested making me the star of the comic, then I really wanted to do it, because I’d finally get my big chance to be a superhero. So that was how it all came together. We’ve been kind of working on it for three years, and I’m completely amazed that we actually got it to come out. When the box of comics came to my house last week and I looked at one, I started crying, because I was like, “Alright, it’s hard for me to believe this is real.” [laughs] It’s been such a long time coming.Is it a similar feeling to, say, having your first album come out, or your first major movie?Let me think… Yeah, of course it’s a similar excitement. I think when I first started making records, I was so young that I just had this sort of naïve confidence, and now that I’m older, I have no confidence that anything’s ever going to work. So just the fact that we got it to happen was almost more thrilling, because we followed through and made it happen. I can’t control anything that happens besides that, but at least I got that damn comic book out in the real world. It feels like a huge accomplishment.What are some of the influences on the comic? I see a certain amount of ’50s, “Keep Watching the Skies!” sci-fi in there.Yeah, definitely. I think because Bill and I are the same age, a lot of our influences were exactly the same. And in fact, we didn’t really talk about it that much; it just came out of us really naturally when we were co-writing. Both of us love flying saucers and aliens and robots, and both of us collect all that stuff. We had so much in common that it was only natural that the book would be full of those kinds of images. Some of the things we did discuss and put into the comic were that we wanted it to be sassy and sexy, but sexy in a way that was a little bit more subtle than, you know, in-your-face giant boobs and orgy scenes or something. So it is more of a playful sexiness while still being, I would say, relatively safe for kids. [laughs] And I say “relatively safe” because I don’t have kids, and I’m not really sure, but I think it’s fine, and judging from the people that kids love now anyway, like pop stars and stuff, it seems like this is so innocent compared to all that nonsense.It’s a monthly comic, right?Yeah. Wow, that’s killing us, actually. You have no idea how hard it is to get a comic book done in a month. For me, I can’t draw at all; I can only write. So I’m sitting here twiddling my thumbs, trying to get people across the country to draw, because Bill doesn’t have time to draw it all himself, so we’ve had to hire outside artists. And they’re really great, and I can’t even get mad at them, because they’ll send a page and it’ll be beautiful, but I’ll be like, “Okay, I really need the rest of it.” “Okay, any minute!” And then two weeks later, “Please, I’m begging you! Please send me that artwork!” It’s so stressful. I had no idea about all that going into it, or I might have thought twice about it. Or maybe I would have made it more like The Simpsons, where it’s like really simple drawing, instead of these really elaborate things, where each panel is like a piece of art.Obviously there’s a lot of you in Lady Robotika. Does this mean we may get to see some Lady Robotika performances in the future?Oh, yeah, definitely. Are you in LA? Monday night, I’m going to be performing at Meltdown Comics; we’re doing a signing there. But yeah, I put together a band of friends that are fun and cute, and we’re going to do a short set and I’m going to be sitting down, because, to be honest, I was supposed to be on a Go-Go’s tour right now, but I had a hiking accident, and I’m kind of laid up. So the show isn’t going to be my usual jumping-around, going-crazy kind of show; it’s going to be just a few songs with me sitting on a stool. But it should still be fun, and hopefully in the future we’re going to do a lot more shows, because I do have a whole album of Lady Robotika-inspired songs written.Be on the lookout for Issue #1 of Jane Wiedlin’s Lady Robotika, which should currently be lining the shelves of your nearest comic shop.Also, as an added treat, if you’re in Los Angeles, be sure to drop by Meltdown Comics in Hollywood on Monday, July 26th, to see Jane perform live at the official release party!","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Awards, italian, Black, in, and, The, Sematary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Jane-Wiedlin-of-the-GoGos"},{"id":"47508881631847","title":"The Killing Joke Premieres, Four Almodóvar Films Go Digital, and More Movies Streaming This Week","content":"Now Streamingvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Killing Joke Premieres, Four Almodóvar Films Go Digital, and More Movies Streaming This Weekby RT Staff | July 26, 2016 |  CommentsThis week on streaming video, we’ve got a highly anticipated Batman animated film, four selections from the filmography of celebrated Spanish director&nbsp;Pedro Almodóvar and a couple of small recent films available to purchase.

Basically, all you need to know about this movie is that Lawrence’s character complains that she was sent to “whore school” for her training. This is extremely graphic, violent material.But there are other movies about spies that are far more appropriate for you to watch with your family. Here are a few suggestions:THE RECOMMENDATIONSSpy Kids (2001)  93%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for action sequences and brief language.The first Spy Kids was good. Then it was all downhill from there. The fact that Robert Rodriguez was applying his indie sensibilities to a colorful and lively family flick after making his name with the low-budget shoot-‘em-up El Mariachi&nbsp;was exciting, and the movie itself has an enjoyable, goofy energy about it. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino star as married secret agents. When they disappear, it’s up to their son and daughter (Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega) to rescue them. There’s some potty humor and some bizarre creatures. The kids find themselves in danger, but it’s always depicted in a humorous way. If you’re going to watch any of the Spy Kids movies, this is the one to choose. The (many) sequels felt strained and not nearly as inspired. Fine for viewers around 7 and older.Agent Cody Banks (2003)  38%Rating: PG, for action violence, mild language and some sensual content.I’m not saying it’s a great piece of cinema. But this kid version of James Bond will likely entertain the kids in your own house. And it features two likable young stars in Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff, who successfully made the tricky transition from child actor to grown-up performer. Muniz stars in the title role as a seemingly ordinary 15-year-old who lives a secret life as a spy, having trained at CIA summer camp. When he has to befriend a scientist’s daughter (Duff) as part of his first assignment, he realizes he has no idea how to talk to girls. But then when she gets kidnapped, he has to do more than just talk to her – he has to rescue her. The action set pieces, which include fights, chases and explosions, are big and cartoonish. The villains also are over the top. There’s a bit of language and suggestive humor. But overall, I’d say this is fine for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.Dr. No (1962)  95%Rating:&nbsp;PGIt’s a classic, of course: The first James Bond movie, which introduced Sean Connery in the iconic role and featured some of the most enduring imagery of the long-running series. Agent 007 must travel to Jamaica to discover what happened to a missing colleague; what he stumbles upon is the evil Dr. No and a plot to interfere with American rocket launches. It’s pure escapism, filled with lavish settings, elaborate action sequences and beautiful women. But while Dr. No seems tame compared to movies of this genre being made today – especially the modern, Daniel Craig Bond films — it’s definitely not for very young kids. Bond famously has a license to kill, and he infamously has a way with the ladies. A lot is suggested without being shown on camera, but still – watching this movie may result in some conversations you’re not ready to have yet. But if you have kids in your house who love action movies and are interested in learning about the films that influence what they watch today, Dr. No is fine for tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Sundance, Music, dceu, bad, Games, critics, Britbox, First, Fox, Month, nature, Spike, black, scorecard, FirstLook","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/02123633/Spy-Kids-PG.jpg","slug":"three-spy-movies-you-can-watch-with-your-family-instead-of-red-sparrow"},{"id":"47508897498894","title":"Digital Multiplex: Wreck-It Ralph, Manhunter, Big Fish, and More","content":"Now Streamingvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Digital Multiplex: Wreck-It Ralph, Manhunter, Big Fish, and Moreby RT Staff | March 8, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend in streaming, there’s a wide variety to pick from, including something for the little ones (Oscar-nominated Wreck-It Ralph), something for the teens (Big Fish), something for the action junkie (Luc Besson’s La Femme Nikita), something thrilling (Manhunter), something for 80s nostalgia (Pretty in Pink), and more.

But&nbsp;if you’ve got older kids, and you’re really looking to see the movie yourself, here’s what you should know about it.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Logan Lucky (2017)  92%Rating: PG-13, for language and some crude comments.Steven Soderbergh is back, four years after saying he was retiring from filmmaking, with another heist movie – but this one’s more down-home and low-key than the splashy Ocean’s&nbsp;trilogy. Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, and Riley Keough play siblings who scheme to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina during a major NASCAR race. Along the way they have to stage a prison break – in and out, then back in again – steal various cars, avoid the authorities, and still be done in time for Tatum’s character to attend a beauty pageant where his young daughter is competing. There’s language scattered throughout, a bit of violence during a bar brawl, some explosions, and general destruction in order to pull off the scheme. Plus, you know, these are criminals – but they’re quick-witted, clever criminals. The subject matter, the pacing, and the length of the film (a minute shy of two hours) will probably make this a tough sit for anyone younger than about 11 or 12 and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Television, screen, PaleyFest, jamie, venice, Poppins, The, Emmys, history, 2020, Horse, franchise, Emmy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/18102203/Logan-Lucky-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-logan-lucky"},{"id":"47508909034366","title":"How Family-Friendly is The Secret Life of Pets?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is The Secret Life of Pets?by Christy Lemire | July 8, 2016 |  CommentsJust because a film is animated, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s completely suitable for all ages. This week, Christy offers the lowdown on Illumination’s The Secret Life of Pets, which is probably fine for everyone. Read on for the details on that one, as well as an Oscar-nominated animation from Brazil on DVD.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Secret Life of Pets (2016)  72%Rating: PG, for action and some rude humor.What do your pets do all day while you’re away? That’s the premise of this animated comedy from the folks who brought you the Despicable Me&nbsp;movies and Minions.&nbsp;It’s essentially the same idea behind Toy Story, but without the emotional complexity; Pets&nbsp;is basically about friendship, and it’s more interested in lively, colorful antics. Max (voiced by Louis C.K.), a loyal Jack Russell terrier enjoying a comfy life with his owner, Katie (Ellie Kemper), ends up with an unwelcome roommate when Katie brings home a big, shaggy stray from the pound named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Max and Duke become separated from their dog-walking group at the park and go on an adventure through the streets, alleys and sewers of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Along the way, they’re pursued by mean dogcatchers (who are slapsticky and silly) and they reluctantly team up with an underground group of wild animals led by a diabolical bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart). Max and Duke are frequently in danger and nearly drown at one point, and there are a few references to death of both the animal and human kind. There are the obligatory bits about butt-sniffing and nervous peeing. And a perky Pomeranian named Gidget (Jenny Slate) unleashes martial-arts fury on a bunch of creatures to protect her beloved Max, but it’s played for laughs. This movie is high-energy and harmless and, for the most part, fine for the whole family.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Boy and the World (O Menino e o Mundo) (2015)  93%Rating: PG, for thematic material and images.Viewers of all ages will be fine watching this beautiful, strange and wondrous animated film from Brazilian writer-director Ale Abreu. It tells the story of a boy who dares to wander from his country home to the big city in search of his father, who has traveled there seeking work. As he ventures farther from his family’s farm and closer to the teeming metropolitan center, the boy encounters overworked field hands, cramped favelas, miserable commuters and the general destruction industrialization can cause. As a cautionary tale, Boy and the World&nbsp;isn’t saying much that’s new (and isn’t saying it in a way that’s terribly subtle). But as an artistic exercise, the film is dazzling, full of vibrant hues and rich textures. It looks like a slightly more sophisticated version of children’s color-pencil drawings come to life, and its aesthetic is constantly evolving and surprising. I watched the film with my 6-year-old son, who asked lots of questions because there’s no dialogue and many of the characters essentially look the same. But he also loved the film’s colorful, playful vibe and the infectious, samba-infused score.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Adventures, NBC, SDCC, Seed, Interview, Golden, Cartoon, park, Competition, Year, of","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/08111404/Secret-Life-of-Pets.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-the-secret-life-of-pets"},{"id":"47508907592559","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Ouija: Origin of Evil, and Keeping Up with the Joneses?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Ouija: Origin of Evil, and Keeping Up with the Joneses?by Christy Lemire | October 21, 2016 |  CommentsAll of the big wide releases this week are rated PG-13, but they include an action-packed shoot-em-up, a creepy horror flick, and a ridiculous comedy, so the rating may be deceptive.&nbsp;Read on to see how family-friendly they are.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016)  38%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of violence and action, some bloody images, language and thematic elements.The sequel to 2012’s Jack Reacher finds Tom Cruise pummeling more bad guys – and running, always running — even as his character is suspected of being a bad guy himself. This time, he teams up with Cobie Smulders, who plays an old friend accused of espionage. Brutal fight sequences, thrilling action set pieces and considerable carnage ensue. Characters get shot and beaten to death in director Edward Zwick’s film, which is once again based on a Lee Child novel. But because this is PG-13 violence, there isn’t exactly a realistic amount of bloodshed. There’s also some language scattered throughout, the suggestion of drugs and a grown-up subplot about whether Reacher has a daughter he never knew. This is probably OK for viewers around 12 or 13 and older.Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016)  82%Rating: PG-13, for disturbing images, terror and thematic elements.Good lord, is this movie scary. It’s also a total blast. But it’s got some supremely creepy imagery that will freak you out no matter how old you are. In this prequel to the 2014 horror movie Ouija, set in 1967, Elizabeth Reaser stars as a widowed fortuneteller living in Los Angeles and raising her two daughters (Annalise Basso and Lulu Wilson). One day, she brings home a hot new board game called Ouija to spice up her activities with her clients. Soon, strange things start happening involving the younger daughter, Wilson’s Doris, who has connected with restless spirits who inhabited the family’s house decades earlier. The little girl says and does startling things and her wholesome appearance changes in disturbing ways as the evil builds within her. We also see the actual demon that takes over her body, and there are several terrifying deaths. But director and co-writer Mike Flanagan has made a beautifully crafted horror film, filled with atmosphere and authentic period detail. If you’re a fan of the genre, you’ll dig it. Just don’t bring the kids unless they’re teenagers.Keeping Up With The Joneses (2016)  19%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content, action/violence and brief strong language.Tame suburbanites Jeff and Karen (Zach Galifianakis and Isla Fisher) think they’re happy enjoying the mundane security of their cozy cul-de-sac – until exotic and exciting new neighbors Tim and Natalie (Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot) move in across the street and shake things up. Turns out, they’re spies! Madcap hilarity ensues. Director Greg Mottola (Superbad, Adventureland) has given us a rather conventional fish-out-of-water action comedy, as Jeff and Karen bumble their way through dangerous scenarios and Tim and Natalie struggle to maintain their cover. Expect massive car chases, shootouts and explosions. There’s also a scene in which the husbands get drunk on snake wine; meanwhile, the wives try on lingerie together at the department store. And we see both couples getting a little frisky. This is suitable for kids around 13 and older – but it’s not very good.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Independence Day: Resurgence (2016)  30%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and destruction, and for some language.Kids around 10 and older probably will be fine watching this sequel to the 1996 smash-hit blockbuster Independence Day. But my own son, who was 6 ½ when I brought him to a screening, slept through about half the movie. Lucky him. This time, the aliens are back, and they want… more of the same thing they wanted before, maybe? Not that it matters, because it’s all about the spectacle. It’s big, shiny, and noisy in the over-the-top tradition of Roland Emmerich, but without the kind of visceral thrills you usually get with the director’s outlandish action extravaganzas. Twenty years after the original film’s alien battle, humans have learned to use their technology for everything from space exploration to getting across town more efficiently. But just as America is about to celebrate the anniversary of that victory, the aliens return — in a spaceship that’s 3,000 miles wide, no less — to lock onto our planet and drill into its core for resources. Or something. Anyway, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, and Brent Spiner are back — Will Smith opted out, wisely — fighting alongside newcomers Liam Neeson, Maika Monroe, Jessie T. Usher, William Fichtner and (in the strangest bit of casting of all) Charlotte Gainsbourg. There’s massive urban destruction, ostensibly resulting in massive death, little of which we actually see. The aliens are big, gooey, and relentless in typical alien fashion. Children are in peril — a school bus full of them, for good measure. There’s a bit of language. And there are lots of battles in which human and alien ships shoot green lasers at each other that go “Pew! Pew! Pew!”","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"2020, MSNBC, WarnerMedia, IFC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/21142044/Jack-Reacher.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-jack-reacher-never-go-back-ouija-origin-of-evil-and-keeping-up-with-the-joneses"},{"id":"47508914550719","title":"Parental Guidance: Insurgent, Penguins of Madagascar, and More","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Insurgent, Penguins of Madagascar, and MoreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's movies.by Christy Lemire | March 20, 2015 |  CommentsInsurgent 28%Rating: PG-13, for intense violence and action throughout, some sensuality, thematic elements and brief language.The sequel to last year’s Divergent might be even more violent and intense than its predecessor. It’s also oppressively dour. But because the film carries a PG-13 rating — to make it accessible to the tweens and young teens who also were the target audience for the YA novel source material — there’s minimal bloodshed accompanying the massive gunfire. This time, the rebellious Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her boyfriend, Four (Theo James), are hiding out with some other folks, trying to figure out how best to take down the totalitarian dictator Jeanine (Kate Winslet). But Jeanine is after Tris, too, to put her through a series of simulations which will open a magical box that contains an important message, or something. This sometimes means Tris must endure harrowing imagery and fight dangerous battles. In real life, she and Four also have sex, but we don’t really see anything; the act is implied through kissing and naked backs. If your kids have seen the first film, they’re in for a lot of the same here.New On DVD:Penguins of Madagascar 73%Rating: PG, for mild action and some rude humor.The playful penguins who stole every scene in the Madagascar series have gotten a movie of their own. Part origin story and part spin-off, it explains how Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private became globetrotting super spies and it follows them on an all-new adventure. John Malkovich lends his rich voice to the shape-shifting bad guy they’re after: an angry octopus who’s pretending to be a mad scientist. He kidnaps penguins from zoos and aquariums around the world with plans to inject them with a serum that will turn them into hideous versions of themselves. He hopes they’ll seem less appealing to the masses, but they actually become more silly than frightening. The penguins end up in several dangerous situations but they always find a way to escape. There’s a lot of silly spanking among the animals as well as some fart jokes and flatulence puns, but it’s the kind of harmless, puerile humor that routinely cracks kids up. Nothing here is shocking or inappropriate. This is totally suitable for all ages, although a lot of the pop-culture gags are just for us grown-ups.Annie 28%Rating: PG, for some mild language and rude humor.This movie is terrible. But if it’s the only family-friendly film available for rental… well, it’s still terrible. It’s a modern-day version of the enduring stage musical, which has been moved from the Great Depression to present day Manhattan. This time, the plucky orphan Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) moves in with a billionaire cell-phone mogul (Jamie Foxx) and melts his heart… in song! The celebration of materialism is seriously amped up here, which is sort of depressing. Annie enjoys a helicopter ride around New York City and hands out free phones to her foster-kid friends. Cameron Diaz is rather shrill and inept as Miss Hannigan but she’s not as intimidating as she’s been in previous versions; she’s more pathetic than anything else. And Annie briefly finds herself in danger when she goes off with a couple who pretend to be her birth parents, but she’s not hurt in any way. Suitable for all ages.Exodus: Gods and Kings 31%Rating: PG, for violence including battle sequences and intense images.Mature tweens and older will probably be fine watching this massive biblical epic from director Ridley Scott, which makes his Oscar-winning Gladiator look like a tiny indie by comparison. With the use of massive visual effects, Scott tells the Old Testament story of Moses leading hundreds of thousands of Hebrew slaves out of Egypt to freedom. That means plagues — lots and lots of plagues — from frogs to locusts to boils. (The boils are especially gross.) And because everything has gotten so chaotic and overpopulated under the reign of the inept Ramses (Joel Edgerton), slaves are thrown into enormous fires to thin out the city. There are also several elaborate battle scenes, perilous chariot chases and a pummeling wall of water once Moses (Christian Bale) has finished parting the Red Sea. And be warned: besides the violence and the subject matter, the film runs nearly two and a half hours, which might be quite a slog for younger viewers.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Television, adaptation, technology, HBO, Max, king, Family, Academy, Winners, war, spy, Marvel, WarnerMedia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/annie-parental.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-insurgent-penguins-of-madagascar-and-more"},{"id":"47508919748591","title":"Parental Guidance: Divergent and Muppets Most Wanted, Plus Frozen and Saving Mr. Banks","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Divergent and Muppets Most Wanted, Plus Frozen and Saving Mr. BanksWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | March 21, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Divergent 41%Rating: PG-13, for intense violence and action, thematic elements and some sensuality.The movie version of Veronica Roth’s young adult bestseller takes place in a rigidly structured dystopian future, so naturally this means teens are going to have to battle each other for survival. It’s a crucial part of the formula. For the tweens and older who’ve read the book, the film adaptation is probably fine. They (and you) know what to expect. Shailene Woodley stars as Beatrice, or Tris, who must decide which of society’s five factions is the best for her. Once she joins the Dauntless, known for their bravery, she learns to fight, shoot, throw knives and jump from trains. But she also must defend herself from her fellow initiates, who are trying to undermine her, and face her deepest fears within elaborate simulations. A sizable body count builds up during the film’s big action sequences toward the end, but because this is PG-13, there’s very little blood.Muppets Most Wanted 80%Rating: PG, for some mild action.The Muppets are back in yet another high-energy, star-studded, song-and-dance extravaganza. This time, they’re performing in major cities throughout Europe with an internationally known jewel thief, a frog named Constantine, pretending to be Kermit at the helm. There’s nothing even remotely inappropriate here. Miss Piggy is in slight danger, briefly, and the rest of the Muppets have to put themselves in peril to save her. And much of the action takes place inside a Siberian gulag (where a hilarious Tina Fey is the warden) but even that is depicted so cartoonishly, it’s never frightening. A Monsters University short precedes the feature, which is pretty darn delightful, as well.New On DVD:Frozen 90%Rating: PG, for some action and mild rude humor.You probably already have “Let It Go” playing repeatedly in your head like a psychotic episode. Now you can own Frozen on DVD and sear the song into your brain permanently. The Oscar-winning Disney animated musical has become a pop-culture phenomenon, and understandably so. It’s extremely entertaining for the whole family, especially if you have little girls in your house. Broadway veteran Idina Menzel lends her voice to the character of Elsa, a newly crowned queen who loses control and turns her idyllic kingdom to ice. Her younger sister (Kristen Bell), Princess Anna, goes on a journey with some new friends to retrieve Elsa from her self-imposed, mountaintop exile. The only vaguely scary element here is the giant snow monster Elsa creates to protect her fortress from intruders, but it’s on screen briefly and might frighten only the youngest viewers.Saving Mr. Banks 79%Rating: Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements including some unsettling images.A shamelessly sentimental retelling of how charismatic Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) persuaded persnickety Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to let him turn her beloved children’s book into a movie musical. It’s not entirely accurate from a historical perspective, but it’s certainly suitable and sufficiently cheery fare, full of upbeat tunes and cathartic tears. The only reason I can imagine for the PG-13 rating is that Saving Mr. Banks includes some flashbacks to Travers’ childhood with a father (Colin Farrell) whose alcoholism destroyed him. Showing your kids the actual Mary Poppins movie might be a better call.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Fall, Nat, Tyler","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-divergent-and-muppets-most-wanted-plus-frozen-and-saving-mr-banks"},{"id":"47508928986171","title":"Red Carpet Pictures From the 2018 Film Independent Spirit Awards","content":"Red Carpet Roundupgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})Red Carpet Pictures From the 2018 Film Independent Spirit Awardsby Alex Vo | March 3, 2018 |  CommentsA little rain can’t dampen these&nbsp;Spirits.

Tolkien’s The Hobbit is ridiculously violent. Yes, it’s all computer-generated fantasy spectacle, but what a spectacle it is – full of piercing arrows, ominous shadows, stabbings and beheadings, with some of those severed heads flying right at the camera. If the giant talking spiders don’t get you, the fierce (and fiercely ugly) orcs will. General peril abounds as Bilbo Baggins and his dwarf pals try and make their way to the Lonely Mountain – and then once they get there, they must contend with the ferocious and fire-breathing dragon Smaug, voiced menacingly by Benedict Cumberbatch. Given the graphic nature of this movie and the extended running time, this really is just for the most mature tweens and up.Saving Mr. Banks 79%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements including some unsettling images.I’m actually not quite sure why this movie gets a PG-13 rating – maybe because it includes some flashbacks to a childhood with a father whose alcoholism destroyed him. For the most part, Saving Mr. Banks is a cheery (and not entirely accurate) retelling of how folksy Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) persuaded uptight Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to let his studio make a film based on her cherished children’s book. It’s a shamelessly sentimental infomercial by Disney, for Disney, about Disney, full of upbeat songs and cathartic tears. Fine for most kids.Tyler Perry’s A Madea Christmas 20%Rating: PG-13, for sexual references, crude humor and language.This movie is amazingly terrible — incoherent and sloppily constructed in a way that?s surreal — so if you love your children, you probably shouldn’t take them to see it. But! If you’re at the multiplex trying to find something the whole family can enjoy after a long day of holiday shopping ? well, this still probably isn’t the best choice. Multimedia multi-hyphenate Tyler Perry returns to the sassy drag of his Madea character, a crass and wacky old lady with no internal censor. Most of the stuff she babbles about will go over kids’ heads – references to lingerie, drugs and stripping, for starters. Larry the Cable Guy shows up and magnifies the raunch factor with some sexual innuendos – which, again, probably won’t register with young viewers. There’s also a massively contrived car crash and explosion that might have been vaguely suspenseful in the hands of someone, you know, capable.New On DVD:Despicable Me 2 75%Rating: PG, for rude humor and mild action.Minions, minions and more minions make this sequel to the 2010 international hit such a delight. There isn’t a single thing in this movie that would make it inappropriate or objectionable in any way. When a powerful potion turns some of the babbling, bright yellow creatures into crazed, purple-monster versions of themselves, they’re a little more manic but never truly frightening. This remains my 4-year-old son’s favorite among the many animated films he saw this year.Classic Fantasy Films:Princess Mononoke 93%This gorgeous and wondrous animated fantasy from Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki features a true warrior princess: a fierce young woman named San (voiced by Claire Danes in the English-language version) who can communicate with the spirits. She finds herself in the center of a war between animals, humans (whom she hates) and demons in a mystical 14th century setting. Too intense and complex for the littlest kids but a thrill for everyone else.Time Bandits 90%From the endlessly creative mind of Monty Python animator Terry Gilliam comes this comic adventure about a boy who time travels with a group of dwarves. Along the way, he runs into historical figures including Robin Hood and Napoleon. It’s got some darkness to its tone, which may disturb very little kids. But with its elaborately detailed production design, it’s always a wonder to watch.The Princess Bride 97%Long before films like Shrek took familiar fairy-tale conventions and turned them on their head, there was Rob Reiner’s cleverly self-referential comedy. A favorite from my own youth, The Princess Bride remains endlessly quotable with its colorful characters and swashbuckling scenarios. It’s charming and subversive in equal measure but, at its core, has an irresistibly sweet heart.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Rock, Kids","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-hobbit-saving-mr-banks-and-classic-fantasy-films"},{"id":"47508934838387","title":"Red Carpet Roundup With Lily James, Alexandra Daddario, Matt Smith and More","content":"Red Carpet Roundupgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})Red Carpet Roundup With Lily James, Alexandra Daddario, Matt Smith and Moreby Alex Vo | February 4, 2016 |  CommentsHit the red carpet for the premieres of&nbsp;Hail, Caesar!,&nbsp;The Choice, and&nbsp;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.Alexandra DaddarioLily JamesMatt SmithLena HeadeyJack HustonEllie BamberHermione Corfield, Ellie Bamber, Suki Waterhouse, Millie Brady, Bella Heathcote and Lily JamesBella HeathcoteFrancesca NewmanZara HollandNicole BassLily JamesSuki WaterhouseMillie BradyDouglas BoothJosh Brolin and Kathryn BoydAlison PillVeronica OsorioCaitlin MuelderMelissa BolonaNatasha BassettGeorge Clooney (R) and Amal ClooneyKathryn BoydJonah HillChanning Tatum and Jenna Dewan-TatumJenna Dewan-TatumTeresa PalmerBenjamin Walker and Teresa PalmerMaggie GraceMadeline BrewerNoree VictoriaBecca TilleyKatherine McNamaraRenee OlsteadSkai JacksonArden ChoJeannie Mai","section":"Red Carpet Roundup","tags":"Family, Returns, school, horror","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/04155720/600RCR.jpg","slug":"red-carpet-roundup-with-lily-james-alexandra-daddario-matt-smith-and-more"},{"id":"47508989014625","title":"Total Recall:  Anthony Hopkins’ Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Anthony Hopkins' Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Wolfman star.by Jeff Giles | February 9, 2010 |  CommentsSome actors struggle with typecasting for their entire careers — and some, like Anthony Hopkins, get to do pretty much whatever they want. Since making his film debut in 1968, Hopkins has dabbled in everything from Merchant Ivory period dramas to horror, moving from television to film — and picking up an Academy Award, and several nominations, along the way. He’s battled a bear in The Edge, walked away unscathed from the misery of Joel Schumacher’s Bad Company, and even survived Freejack, but he’s never been given the Rotten Tomatoes Total Recall treatment — so in honor of his supporting turn in The Wolfman, we decided now would be the perfect time to look back at the 10 best-reviewed films in his distinguished career.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1154562[/tomatometer]10. The World’s Fastest IndianA name like The World’s Fastest Indian doesn’t exactly conjure up images of a Kiwi in his late 60s, but don’t let the disorienting combination of Anthony Hopkins’ face floating over the title on the poster keep you from watching. For one thing, Hopkins has called this his favorite performance; for another, the real-life adventures of New Zealand motorcycle tinkerer Burt Munro, who topped 200 MPH on his souped-up Indian Scout, make for one of the most entertaining, albeit unusual, biopics you’ve probably never seen. While it never enjoyed much more than a limited run here in the States, critics were kind to Indian — among them the Boston Globe’s Janice Page, who wrote, “History dictates that you know how the story ends. Still, the heart beats no less fast when you watch Munro’s Indian rocketing across those salt flats. You can see how it might be enough to justify a journey halfway around the world.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1041859[/tomatometer]9. Bram Stoker’s DraculaBy 1992, the world had seen enough Dracula adaptations — many of them sadly subpar — that the character was in desperate need of a fresh, suitably creepy start. Enter Francis Ford Coppola and his lavishly mounted Bram Stoker’s Dracula, which pit Gary Oldman as the titular vampire against Hopkins as his arch-nemesis Van Helsing — and threw in a marquee cast that included Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves, as well as an Annie Lennox song over the closing credits, for added megaplex appeal. Given its impeccable pedigree, the fact that Coppola’s Dracula was a financial success didn’t come as much of a surprise — but unlike a lot of previous adaptations, particularly those of recent vintage, it was also a success with critics, many of whom welcomed the opportunity to see a director as talented as Coppola interpret the vampire’s classic tale. In the words of the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson, “It is Coppola’s most lavish and, certainly, his most flamboyant film; never before has he allowed himself this kind of mad experimentation.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1013029[/tomatometer]8. MagicThe first of three collaborations between Hopkins and director Richard Attenborough, 1978’s Magic is one of the stranger entries in Hopkins’ admittedly eclectic filmography — a horror movie about an unsuccessful magician named Corky (Hopkins) whose professional expansion to ventriloquism masks a worsening case of multiple personality disorder. Doing a sort of double duty as both Corky and the voice of his murderous dummy “Fats,” Hopkins added to his burgeoning horror resume as part of a stellar cast that included Ann-Margaret, Burgess Meredith, and David Ogden Stiers. While Magic wasn’t a huge commercial success, most critics expressed admiration for the puppet-driven tragedy, and it remains one of the stranger entries in a filmography heavy with big-budget productions and period dramas. As Rory L. Aronsky of Film Threat wrote, “Because of Hopkins, because of Ann-Margret (who hardly looks like that Ann-Margret, adeptly proving herself as an occasional dramatic actress), and because of Burgess Meredith as well as Fats the dummy, Magic is one of the top-notch films of the 1970s.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1083302[/tomatometer]7. The Mask of ZorroFor decades, the legend of Zorro held a reliable grip on film audiences, but by the 1990s, Hollywood seemed to have forgotten his appeal; the most recent movie to feature the swashbuckling bandit, 1981’s Zorro, the Gay Blade, was a broad parody starring George Hamilton as both the black-clad hero and his gay twin brother, Bunny. On the surface, Hopkins may have seemed an odd choice for The Mask of Zorro, which presented him as an aged version of the title character, in search of a man capable of assuming his legend and defeating the villanous Don Rafael Montero. Ultimately, however, neither audiences nor critics had much trouble accepting Hopkins as the Spanish swordsman who trains his much younger successor (Antonio Banderas); in fact, despite an ungainly running time of 136 minutes and some rather clumsy stunt editing, Zorro provoked a surprising amount of applause from critics, among them Almar Haflidason of the BBC, who gushed, “There are no clever ground-breaking effects, just lashings of good clean fun with desperately devilish baddies, and good guys so fantastic, so clever and witty, that they make you want to weep with pleasure.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1041803[/tomatometer]6. Howards EndImmediately after collecting a bushel of awards for his portrayal of the despicable Hannibal Lecter, Hopkins made an about face to play a different kind of villain in Howards End — the well-heeled but irredeemably flawed Henry Wilcox, whose casually classist attitudes represent the dark side of early 20th century British capitalist reform. At bottom, Henry is really sort of a cad, but Hopkins infuses him with ambiguity the way only he can; it’s another finely layered performance in a career full of them, and during the era of commercial ascendancy that found Hopkins starring in fluff like Freejack, it served as a gentle reminder of the talent that made him famous. And even if Edwardian dramas generally aren’t your thing, don’t dismiss Howards End out of hand; as Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing wrote, it’s “The best of the countless Merchant Ivory productions — and arguably the most appreciated by those who don’t even like Merchant Ivory movies.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1006527[/tomatometer]5. The Elephant ManBefore David Lynch’s name was synonymous with artsy, non-linear fare, he was the young director whose work on Eraserhead made a fan of Mel Brooks — who, when producing a film based on the life of medical legend and 19th-century British celebrity Joseph Merrick, hired Lynch to direct what would become 1980’s The Elephant Man. Though John Hurt justifiably received much of the film’s critical praise, as well as a Best Actor nomination, it’s Hopkins, as Merrick’s friend and fierce advocate Frederick Treves, that lends Elephant much of its compassion and moral weight. As Christopher Null of Filmcritic wrote, “Understated and masterful in its use of costumes, makeup, and low-budget camerawork, David Lynch’s portrait of John ‘The Elephant Man’ Merrick stands as one of the best biographies on film.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1012386[/tomatometer]4. The Lion in WinterMany successful actors find themselves making excuses (or apologies) for the earliest entries in their resumes, but Anthony Hopkins’ first film was no Leprechaun — he made his debut in the 1968 period piece The Lion in Winter, starring as twelfth-century king Richard the Lionheart in a cast that included Peter O’Toole (as King Henry II) and Katharine Hepburn (as Queen Eleanor). Also kicking off his film career was Timothy Dalton, who appeared as King Philip II, the French monarch and Richard’s future nemesis (and perhaps paramour). Lion would go on to win three of the seven Academy Awards for which it was nominated, including a Best Actress trophy for Hepburn, and marked the first of many Hopkins performances based on historical figures. Praising it as “Less historical spectacle than vicious farce,” Kim Newman of Empire applauded its “great cast spitting venomous dialogue and a young Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton as gay lovers destined to rule England and France.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1048267[/tomatometer]3. ShadowlandsHis gift for fantasy helped make him one of the most successful authors in the world, but C.S. Lewis’ real-life experiences were as noteworthy as his fiction, as evidenced by 1993’s Shadowlands, which recounts his unexpected, slow-blooming love affair with the poet Joy Gresham. First friends, then partners in a marriage of convenience designed to keep her from being deported, Lewis and Gresham found their bond tested when she was diagnosed with cancer — and, in fact, found that their feelings ran deeper than either had planned. A gentle, melancholy tearjerker, Shadowlands reunited Hopkins with Chaplin director Richard Attenborough, and paired him with Debra Winger in a film that brilliantly highlighted the strengths of all three. Praising his work, Janet Maslin of the New York Times wrote, “Here is Mr. Hopkins giving an amazingly versatile and moving performance, shifting the light in those knowing blue eyes to reveal endless shadings between delight and sorrow.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1034185[/tomatometer]2. Silence of the LambsAll the fame, ticket receipts, and critical superlatives aside, if you want to know what a tremendous actor Anthony Hopkins is, you need only consider that he earned a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs — a role that called for less than 20 minutes of screen time. Of course, it didn’t hurt that Lecter was a terrific character, one whose brilliant intellect and bloodthirsty appetites inspired multiple films and books (and helped make author Thomas Harris a very wealthy man in the process). Hopkins would go on to play Lecter on more than one occasion, resurfacing for 2001’s Hannibal and 2002’s Red Dragon — but while both of those films made money, neither approached the level of critical success enjoyed by Silence, which won a whopping five Academy Awards (including Best Picture). It isn’t often that a horror movie scales such heights; Silence succeeded because, in the words of Rolling Stone’s Peter Travers, “For all the unbridled savagery on display, what is shrewd, significant and finally hopeful about Silence of the Lambs is the way it proves that a movie can be mercilessly scary and mercifully humane at the same time.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1046892[/tomatometer]1. Remains of the DayHopkins’ commercial film breakthrough came with his gleefully mad portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, and he hasn’t been above chewing the scenery on occasion — but he’s also more than capable of occupying the other end of the dramatic spectrum, as evidenced by his impeccably reserved work in Merchant Ivory’s Remains of the Day. Adapted from the Kazuo Ishiguro novel, Remains tells the story of an implacable butler (Hopkins) and the comparatively hot-tempered housekeeper who grows to love him (Emma Thompson) during their years together in a pre-World War II British estate. Not the stuff of blockbuster epics, obviously, but it picked up eight Academy Award nominations, gave Hopkins the opportunity to wring incredible drama from an act as simple as raising his hat, and reaffirmed his status as one of the few actors capable of making the jump between the megaplex and the arthouse. Among Remains‘ many appreciative critics was Variety’s Todd McCarthy, who wrote, “All the meticulousness, intelligence, taste and superior acting that one expects from Merchant Ivory productions have been brought to bear.”In case you were wondering, here are Hopkins’ top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. Silence of the Lambs — 97%2. The Elephant Man — 95%3. The World’s Fastest Indian — 91%4. Remains of the Day — 90%5. Chaplin — 89%6. Amistad — 87%7. Howards End — 87%8. Shadowlands — 87%9.

Time will tell if The Invasion is remembered as a movie thatcaptured something about the way we live in the 2000s (though with its 21percent Tomatometer score, that seems unlikely), but one thing is for certain:It’s the latest in a long line of films that attempt to grapple with ourcollective anxiety in uncertain times.Perhaps, in this age of domestic spying and alleged sleeper cells, we’re moreanxious than ever. If nothing else, filmmakers have certainly found much to minefrom our collective angst; in 2007 alone, such varied films as The Bourne Ultimatum,Disturbia, The Lives OfOthers, Red Road,and Civic Dutyhave hit screens. Despite profoundly different settings and methods ofexecution, what these films share is a sense of unease, be it in the form ofvast machinations exerting greater control over our lives, or a sneakingsuspicion that someone’s watching.The cinema of paranoia is nothing new; you can expect moviemakers to tap into aspirit of discontent. In fact, for one of the finest examples of how the moviescan depict a society torn apart by fear, you have to go all the way back to thebirth of the sound era.Fritz Lang‘sM, made inGermany only a few years before the Nazis took power, depicts a nation wherethere’s only a thin line between the cops and the criminals, where paranoia andfear can sweep through the streets like a fever. In the role that made himcinema’s favorite sketchy character,Peter Lorreplays a child killer whose crimes have set the city on edge; when an elderly mantries to help a lost child, he’s accused of being the killer and beaten for histrouble. The situation becomes so dire that even the city’s crime bosses decideto find M, since he’s making it hard for them to do business. Once Lorre isbeing pursued by both the police and the underworld, a strange thing happens: hebecomes our point of reference, and we realize we identify with him, partlybecause he’s as much a manifestation of collective fear as he is an evildoer.M is a forerunner to cinema’s most paranoia-minded subgenres (film noir,serial killer flicks, police procedurals), and certainlyDavid Fincherowes a debt to the film; both Se7en (84percent) and Zodiac(88 percent) borrow from its bleak, shadowy palette. As Dave Kehr of the ChicagoReader writes, \"The moral issues are complex and deftly handled: Lorre is atonce entirely innocent and absolutely evil. Lang’s detached, modifiedexpressionist style gives the action a plastic beauty.\" It’s at 100 percent onthe Tomatometer.Many horror and science fiction movies of the 1950s drew from a variety ofpostwar fears, from atomic power to the rise of Communism. Though it’s beenremade twice (and The Invasion was originally intended as a straightremake as well), the original Body Snatchers retains a potent, disquieting aura, and as a politicalallegory it’s tantalizingly hard to read. The plot involves a doctor (KevinMcCarthy) who finds that many of the citizens of his small town have startedacting strange; they look the same as they ever did, but emit no emotionwhatsoever. He soon discovers plant-like aliens are taking over people’s bodieswhen they fall asleep, stripping them of their humanity and spreading out toclaim more victims. Is it a dark satire on the (Joseph, not Kevin) McCarthy era?A warning of what a Communist future would bring?However one reads it, there’s no denying Body Snatchers has proven to beone of the most durable and influential sci-fi films of the 1950s, inspiringeverything from Shaun of the Dead (90 percent) to Signs (74 percent). Andit’s at 100 percent on the Tomatometer. \"Its title implies that it’s somethingyou might watch for its campy comic value,\" writes Audrey Rock-Richardson of TheTooele Transcript Bulletin, \"but it’s flat-out nightmarish.In the 1970s, the fallout from the Watergate break-in — and the general feelingthat the government was veering into criminal territory — inspired a number offine suspense films, fromThree Daysof the Condor (92 percent) to The Parallax View(91 percent). But perhaps the finest paranoid thriller from the post-Watergateera is TheConversation,FrancisFord Coppola‘s taut, haunting reworking of Blow-Up (85percent). GeneHackman stars as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who’s been commissionedto listen in on the conversations of a powerful businessman’s daughter. Caul isintensely private — he lives alone in an apartment with four or five deadbolts,and he never gives out his phone number — but he’s also results-oriented to theextreme, more concerned about making the perfect recording than what anyone’ssaying on the tape. But on his latest job, he can’t help but notice that theyoung woman he’s taping seems to be discussing something particularly ominous;is she in grave danger?Caul’s attempt to get at the truth result in a chilling embodiment of the oldadage: \"Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean someone’s not after you.\"Featuring hypnotic sound editing from Walter Murch, as well as one of GeneHackman’s finest performances, The Conversation \"grapples with the moralissue at stake in a country where technology has outstripped our knowledge ofhow to use and control it,\" writes Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of Spiritualityand Practice. At 97 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"masterpiece of modern-dayparanoia is far more than a simple rehashing of a classic slice of cinema. Itproves to be more prescient now than ever,\" says Shannon J. Harvey ofAustralia’s Sunday Times.These movies are merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Whenever there’s acollective unease, someone will make a film like Panic in theStreets (92 percent), TheManchurian Candidate (100 percent), or V for Vendetta(72 percent) that taps into our sense of fear.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"on, Netflix, Disney+, universal, cars, movie, festivals, CW","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-The-Invasion-Joins-A-Long-List-Of-Paranoia-Movies"},{"id":"47509019947877","title":"Video: How Long Can Ed Helms Hold His Tra-La-Laaa?","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: How Long Can Ed Helms Hold His Tra-La-Laaa?by RT Staff | June 5, 2017 |  CommentsRT Senior Editor Grae Drake hit the streets to see if fans of Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie could guess what stars Ed Helms and Kevin Hart would hypnotize each other to do.

Four other new films debuted in wide release but generated little interest from moviegoers. Overall, the marketplace suffered the usual late spring slowdown as for the first time since February, the top ten failed to sell $100M worth of tickets.Rising star Shia LaBeouf scored a big victory over the weekend with the thriller \"Disturbia\" which shot straight to number one debuting with an estimated $23M. The PG-13 pic was given the widest release of the frame’s six new entries playing in 2,925 theaters and generated a strong $7,872 average. A modern day version of Alfred Hitchcock’s \"Rear Window,\" Disturbia played to a young female audience as studio research showed that 57% of the crowd was female and 75% was under 35.Just before the film’s opening day, the studio announced that LaBeouf had been cast opposite Harrison Ford in its next \"Indiana Jones\" film. The news may have helped to generate more excitement for Disturbia which was the only major choice for teenage girls this weekend. The safe rating and fairly good reviews may also have contributed. The $20M production looks to become a profitable vehicle.After its two-week run at the top, Will Ferrell’s comedy hit \"Blades of Glory\" slipped to second place dropping a moderate 38% to an estimated $14.1M. The 17-day cume stands at a potent $90.2M. Like \"Disturbia,\" \"Blades\" was produced by DreamWorks and distributed by its new parent Paramount.Slipping only 28% was Disney’s animated comedy \"Meet the Robinsons\" with an estimated $12.1M which lifted the total to $72M. With no new films for young kids this weekend, \"Robinsons\" enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten.Halle Berry and Bruce Willis failed to turn their starpower into box office bucks as their new suspense thriller \"Perfect Stranger\" debuted weaker than expected in fourth place with an estimated $11.5M. The critically-panned Sony release averaged a mediocre $4,322 from 2,661 theaters. With its R rating, \"Perfect Stranger\" played to an adult audience with a female skew. Studio research showed that women made up 54% of the audience and a very high 70% were 25 or older. The opening was weaker than the bows of other films headlined by Berry like \"Catwoman\" ($16.7M) and \"Gothika\" ($19.3M).Ice Cube had a decent second weekend for his comedy sequel \"Are We Done Yet?\" which fell by 36% to an estimated $9.2M. That gave the Sony release a cume of $33M after 12 days. Its predecessor enjoyed a much slimmer 12% dip to $16.3M in its second weekend on its way to $82.3M. \"Done\" might find its way to the vicinity of $55M.Fox’s Viking actioner \"Pathfinder\" limped into sixth place with a weak $4.8M opening, according to estimates. The R-rated film averaged a mild $2,791 from 1,720 locations.The rest of the top ten was filled with four films separated by only $400,000. Buena Vista’s motorcycle comedy \"Wild Hogs\" grossed an estimated $4.6M, down only 30%, for a stellar cume of $152.2M. Hilary Swank’s horror flick \"The Reaping\" tumbled 55% in its second weekend to an estimated $4.6M giving Warner Bros. $19.8M in 11 days.The mighty \"300\" broke through the double century mark over the weekend both domestically and internationally. In North America, the Warner Bros. smash dropped 48% to an estimated $4.3M boosting the total to $200.8M. Overseas, \"300\" collected an estimated $14.8M this weekend to lift the international haul to $204.1M giving the Spartan epic a global tally of $405M and counting. The stylish war film is now the highest grossing March release ever having surpassed the old record holder \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" which grossed $195.3M last spring.Rounding out the top ten was the Quentin Tarantino–Robert Rodriguez flop \"Grindhouse\" which plunged 63% in its sophomore session to an estimated $4.2M. Budgeted at $53M, the double feature has taken in just $19.7M in its first ten days and looks headed for a weak $25-27M finish for The Weinstein Co.In addition to the three new wide releases that debuted in the top ten, another three opened outside of it with weaker results. The car racing pic \"Redline\" bowed to an estimated $4M from 1,607 sites for a slow $2,492 average per theater. The first title from rookie distributor Chicago Pictures stars Eddie Griffin and targeted young males.First Look opened the animated film \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" to the tune of $3.1M, according to estimates, giving the R-rated film an average of just $3,521 from 877 locations. Lionsgate made no impact with its Ray Liotta actioner \"Slow Burn\" which bowed to an estimated $805,000 from 1,163 playdates for a puny average of $692 per theater.Three films fell out of the top ten this weekend. Mark Wahlberg’s sniper pic \"Shooter\" dropped 47% to an estimated $3.1M putting its total at $42.1M. The $60M Paramount release should end its run with $47-49M. Fox’s family film \"Firehouse Dog\" held up well in its second weekend, despite collecting low overall grosses. The PG-rated drama dipped 28% to an estimated $2.8M for a cume of $9.9M after 12 days. Warner Bros. took in an estimated $2.1M for the animated actioner \"TMNT,\" off 56%, for a total of $50.7M. Look for a $53-55M final.Platforming to solid results was the Molly Shannon comedy \"Year of the Dog\" which bowed in seven New York and Los Angeles sites and grossed an estimated $112,000. The Paramount Vantage release averaged $16,049 and will open in nine additional cities this Friday boosting its theater count to more than 30.The top ten films grossed an estimated $92.5M which was down 14% from last year when Scary Movie 4 opened at number one with $40.2M; but up 29% from 2005 when The Amityville Horror debuted on top with $23.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"E!, Walking, movies, Hallmark, Martial, Now, Rey, hidden, Action, fiction, Movies, TCA, VH1, Trek","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Disturbia-Scares-Up-1-Opening"},{"id":"47509154206777","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"13\" Hits #1 But With Worst \"Ocean\"’s Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"13\" Hits #1 But With Worst \"Ocean\"'s Openingby Gitesh Pandya | June 10, 2007 |  CommentsHollywood served up more of the same dishes and moviegoers said enough is enough and found their weekend entertainment elsewhere. The latest star-studded heist sequel \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" managed to open at number one, but with the weakest debut of the franchise.\"Surf’s Up,\" the second animated penguin movie in seven months, attracted a mild debut while the horror sequel \"Hostel Part II\" was butchered on its opening weekend. Overall, the marketplace generated the worst showing for the second weekend of June since 2003.George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Al Pacino made off with the North American box office crown with \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" which debuted on top with an estimated $37.1M. Averaging a solid $10,401 from 3,565 locations, the Warner Bros. release bowed a bit below the openings of the previous installments in the heist franchise. 2001’s \"Ocean’s Eleven\" debuted to $38.1M and a $12,393 average while its 2004 sequel premiered to $39.2M and a $11,901 average. Both opened in early December.\"Thirteen\"’s top spot debut marked the sixth consecutive weekend when a threequel ruled the charts. Given higher ticket prices, additional theaters, the more high-profile summer launch, and the publicity generated from the much-hyped world premiere at Cannes, \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" was expected to open stronger by some in the industry. However, competition for adults was stronger with this chapter with holdovers \"Pirates\" and \"Knocked Up\" grossing a combined $41M. Plus the non-stop assault of sequels may have made some moviegoers sick of paying to see the same characters in the same situations again and again. Reviews were mostly upbeat for the PG-13 caper pic.\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" tumbled another 52% in its third frame and dropped down to second place with an estimated $21.3M pushing its cume to $253.6M. Both previous Captain Jack films, 2003’s \"The Curse of the Black Pearl\" and 2006’s \"Dead Man’s Chest,\" did better in their third weekends with $23.1M and $35.2M, respectively. The latest Disney pic now stands at number 38 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters after 2001’s \"Monsters, Inc.\" which grossed $255.9M. At its current rate of decline, \"At World’s End\" now has no guarantee of reaching the $300M mark which was always seen as an easy milestone before the film’s release. As with the \"Spider-Man\" franchise, the third chapter should become the lowest-grossing installment in the series domestically.But just like with the webslinger, international business is on fire for the latest \"Pirates\" which grossed an estimated $51.3M overseas this weekend, down 50%. That puts the overseas tally at $493.5M and the global gross at a colossal $747M.Universal’s hot comedy \"Knocked Up\" delivered a solid hold in its second weekend thanks to strong word-of-mouth. The R-rated pic collected an estimated $20M, off 35%, for a ten-day cume of $66.2M. By comparison, director Judd Apatow’s last film \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" opened weaker and dipped only 24% to $16.3M in its second weekend for a total of $48.6M in its first ten days. \"Knocked Up\" is proving that a film that is good and original can attract a large paying audience and should go on to gross more than \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" this summer despite having a smaller budget and no bankable stars. A final gross of about $120-130M could result for the pregnancy comedy quadrupling its $30M production cost.The penguin toon \"Surf’s Up\" opened in fourth place with a mediocre launch. Sony’s big summer family pic took in an estimated $18M from an ultrawide 3,528 theaters for a decent $5,102 average. The PG-rated film tells of a young penguin who competes in a surfing competition and was made in a mockumentary style. The debut was weaker than last year’s animated releases from the studio – \"Open Season\" ($23.6M) and \"Monster House\" ($22.2M). \"Surf’s Up\" also bowed to less than half of the $41.5M that last November’s penguin pic \"Happy Feet\" took in on its debut frame. Sony saw a six-week gap between the openings of the summer megatoons \"Shrek the Third\" and Pixar’s \"Ratatouille\" and positioned its entry right in the middle.Close behind in fifth was rival toon \"Shrek the Third\" with an estimated $15.8M in its fourth frame. Off a reasonable 44%, the Paramount release has grabbed $281.9M to date putting it at number 29 on the all-time domestic list. A final gross of around $320M seems likely. The latest ogre now stands as the second biggest DreamWorks film ever after \"Shrek 2\" ($436.7M) and the third largest hit in Paramount history after \"Titanic\" ($600.8M) and \"Forrest Gump\" ($329.7M).Yet another horror failure followed in sixth place. Lionsgate’s \"Hostel Part II\" opened to an estimated $8.8M from 2,350 theaters for a weak $3,723 average. That was less than half of the $19.6M bow that the first \"Hostel\" generated in January 2006 on its way to a solid $47.3M domestic gross. The R-rated sequel once again examines the torture of American students in Slovakia, only with female victims this time. \"Part II\" even opened weaker than other recent horror sequels like \"28 Weeks Later\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes II\" which both bowed to just under $10M each. With so many fright flicks flooding the multiplexes recently and moviegoers ignoring most of them, Lionsgate has to be a bit worried about getting genre fans back into theaters for the fourth consecutive Halloween with its \"Saw IV.\"The Kevin Costner thriller \"Mr. Brooks\" fell 50% to an estimated $5M and placed seventh with a $18.7M total. \"Spider-Man 3\" dropped 45% to an estimated $4.4M in its sixth mission giving Sony $325.7M to date. That keeps the third webslinger adventure at number 17 on the all-time domestic list just behind \"The Lion King\"’s lifetime cume of $328.5M. A $335M final seems likely.Enjoying the smallest decline in the top ten once again was Keri Russell’s comedy \"Waitress\" which dipped only 18% to an estimated $1.7M pushing the cume to $12M for Fox Searchlight. Paramount’s \"Disturbia\" rounded out the top ten with an estimated $550,000, down 51%, giving the thriller $77.8M to date.The top ten films grossed an estimated $132.5M which was down 8% from last year when \"Cars\" opened at number one with $60.1M; and off 1% from 2005 when \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" debuted in the top spot with $50.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"cancelled, medical, TLC, Arts, USA, festival, what, Esquire, TV, Fox, Starz, comedies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-13-Hits-1-But-With-Worst-Oceans-Opening"},{"id":"47509155667021","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Six New Films Try to Shoot Down Spartans From #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Six New Films Try to Shoot Down Spartans From #1 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | March 22, 2007 |  CommentsA half-dozen new soldiers enter the marketplace this weekend trying to topple the kingdom of \"300\" which has reigned supreme at the box office for the past two weeks.Mark Wahlberg toplines the sniper thriller \"Shooter,\" animated ninja turtles fight crime in \"TMNT,\" and mutated zombies attack in \"The Hills Have Eyes 2.\" In addition, moviegoers will get to choose from the kids adventure \"The Last Mimzy,\" the sports saga \"Pride,\" and the Adam Sandler drama \"Reign Over Me.\" Holdovers should witness some large declines as these new pics all fight over the time and attention of ticket buyers. The box office may not have room for all to survive.Seventeen years after shocking the film industry with a record March opening, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back but in animated form in \"TMNT.\" The Warner Bros. toon features the voices of Patrick Stewart, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Ziyi Zhang and carries a PG rating that is friendly for kids. Given the violence, \"TMNT\" should skew more to boys and might even pull in those who grew up with the characters in the late 1980s and early 1990s. With all the R-rated films recently, there have not been too many choices for kids this spring. \"The Last Mimzy\" is the only new release that will provide direct competition for that audience. Bringing its turtle power to 3,110 theaters, \"TMNT\" may generate a bow of roughly $16M this weekend.They’re back.Hot off his recent Oscar nomination, Mark Wahlberg hits the big screen in the action thriller \"Shooter\" playing a former Marine sniper trying to clear his name after being wrongly accused of trying to assassinate the U.S. President. The R-rated film comes from \"Training Day\" director Antoine Fuqua and co-stars Danny Glover and Michael Peña. The film is banking on the starpower of Wahlberg who has been able to anchor hits in recent years. Late summer pics like last year’s \"Invincible\" and 2005’s \"Four Brothers\" opened to $17M and $21.2M, respectively, and brought in solid sales overall. \"Shooter\" is targeting the adult action crowd with appeal that will reach both men and women. Certainly \"300\" will play to much of the same audience and be a factor. Though no Damon or Cruise, Wahlberg has indeed become a believable action hero and is in a role that audiences will buy him in. Plus his Academy nod for \"The Departed\" has only increased audience respect for the former rapper. Opening in 2,600 theaters, \"Shooter\" might take in about $16M for the weekend.Mark Wahlberg, playing a guy named Swagger, in a movie called \"Shooter.\"Last March, Fox Searchlight hit gold with the horror remake \"The Hills Have Eyes\" which bowed to $15.7M and grossed $41.8M overall. A year later, the sequel is born this time coming out through Fox Atomic, the studio’s new division geared towards young adult audiences with genre fare. \"Eyes 2\" once again is targeting the horror crowd with slick marketing hoping to lure in those seeking R-rated gore and violence. Plus the distributor is premiering the trailer to the upcoming fright sequel \"28 Weeks Later\" with the new \"Hills\" installment to help give moviegoers more for their money. Much of the audience for the first pic will probably return, although the sequel will face more competition as \"300\" and \"Shooter\" will both be drawing in young men. Attacking 2,500 theaters, \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" could open to around $13M this weekend.\"The Hills Have Eyes, Too.\"New Line studio chief Bob Shaye steps back into the director’s chair with the family adventure \"The Last Mimzy\" based on a popular short story. The \"E.T.\"-like film about a boy and a girl who find a mysterious animal with mystical powers hopes to attract an audience of kids and parents, but will have to face some stiff competition from its studio’s former heroes, the Ninja Turtles. That toon should take away more boys than girls so \"Mimzy\" may end up skewing a bit more female. New Line hopes that much of the crowd that spent $75M and counting on \"Bridge to Terabithia\" will take a spin with this new effects-filled fantasy so sneak previews were held to help raise awareness and get buzz spreading. Still, a competitive environment will probably cut into its potential. Landing in over 3,000 sites, \"The Last Mimzy\" might gross about $12M this weekend.\"The Last Mimzy.\"Targeting the African American audience this weekend is Lionsgate with its swim team drama \"Pride\" starring Terrence Howard. The PG-rated film will try to appeal to males with the sports saga and females with its human drama and half-nude muscular men. But Howard has not yet proven that he can open a picture on his own and \"Pride\" may not be the one to increase his future salary demands. \"Remember the Titans\" and \"Coach Carter\" both opened north of $20M and much of that was due to starpower. Plus Chris Rock found out last week that African Americans will not just show up for any film with a predominantly black cast. Diving into 1,518 theaters, \"Pride\" could swim to a weekend gross of about $7M.Terrence Howard in \"Pride.\"Adam Sandler goes back to serious territory with the R-rated drama \"Reign Over Me\" playing a man whose life fell apart after his wife and kids were killed on 9/11. It’s no surprise Sony is releasing the film given all the cash the comedian has made for the studio over the years. Don Cheadle and Jada Pinkett Smith co-star. Given the subject matter, the rating, and Sandler’s Bob Dylan haircut, the actor’s core audience of immature young males will not be lining up this time. Remember \"Spanglish‘\"s $8.8M bow? Well, it could get worse for \"Reign.\" After \"United 93\" and \"World Trade Center,\" demand isn’t very high for yet another look at September 11. Given all the choices in the marketplace, adult audiences will be divided between many films so only a small slice might go this way. Debuting in 1,671 venues, \"Reign Over Me\" could open with about $6M.Sandler and Cheadle in \"Reign Over Me.\"The mighty King Leonidas barely broke a sweat over the last two weeks in his box office victories. But the invading armies this weekend will pose a great threat to \"300\"’s rule. \"Shooter\" and \"Hills\" will provide the most direct competition. A 50% drop may be in order which would leave the Warner Bros. epic with roughly $16.5M for the frame and an impressive $157M in 17 days.\"Wild Hogs\" may finally see a normal drop and slide by 40% to $11M giving Buena Vista $121M to date. \"Premonition\" should lose half of its audience and fall to $9M for a ten-day cume of $30M.LAST YEAR: Spike Lee and Denzel Washington joined forces for the heist thriller \"Inside Man\" and found themselves at number one with a potent $29M opening. Universal went on to collect $88.5M domestically and $183M worldwide. The competing actioner \"V for Vendetta\" dropped from first to second with $12.3M falling 52% in its second weekend. Debuting in third was the horror flick \"Stay Alive\" with $10.7M on its way to $23.1M for Buena Vista. Rounding out the top five were \"Failure to Launch\" with $10.5M and \"The Shaggy Dog\" with $9M, both in their third weekends. Bowing in seventh place was the blue collar comedy \"Larry the Cable Guy\" with $6.9M leading to a $15.7M final.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"aliens, ratings, movies, Television, Pirates, CNN, wars, Hallmark, Ice, Awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Six-New-Films-Try-to-Shoot-Down-Spartans-From-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509175058673","title":"Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Movie Development News of 2019","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Movie Development News of 2019A month-by-month round-up of the best news to come out of Hollywood this year.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 27, 2019 |  CommentsFew industries enjoy taking really, really long extended holiday vacations quite like Hollywood, and when we get to this time of the year, there’s rarely much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss. So, this week and next, we’re going to review 12 of the year’s top stories, presented to you in monthly chronology. The year-in-review begins with the “Fresh Developments” of the year.JANUARY: MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 7 AND 8 TO FILM BACK-TO-BACK(Photo by David James/Paramount Pictures)There are lots of long-running movie franchises, but in many of them, the cast changes over time (the MCU and the Rocky/Creed franchises being two exceptions to the rule). In January, we first learned that,&nbsp;in 2022, Tom Cruise will hit movie #8 in the&nbsp;Mission: Impossible franchise, as Mission: Impossible 7 and Mission: Impossible 8 are being developed for release in the summers of 2021 and 2022, respectively. The two movies will be shot back-to-back to ensure their releases within a year of each other, and also to make it easier to secure not just Tom Cruise, but also his supporting cast, which may include Fallout cast like Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, etc. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie&nbsp;will&nbsp;work on these sequels, hoping to match what he’s&nbsp;achieved with the last two films, 2015’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (Certified Fresh at 93%), and last year’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout (Certified Fresh at 97%). Mission: Impossible 7 is now scheduled for July 23, 2021 (the week after LeBron James’ Space Jam 2), and Mission: Impossible 8 is scheduled for August 5, 2022. The first new franchise cast member to be announced for Mission: Impossible 7 was British actress Hayley Atwell, who probably remains best known for playing Marvel’s Peggy Carter, as seen in both Captain America: The First Avenger, and in the much-missed ABC series, Agent Carter. There are no details yet as to where the Mission: Impossible franchise might go after 2022, but Tom Cruise will turn 60 on July 3 of that year, so Mission: Impossible 8 might be his last opportunity to&nbsp;hang off the sides of airplaines and&nbsp;jump off&nbsp;of skyscrapers.FEBRUARY:&nbsp;AQUAMAN GETTING SEQUEL IN 2022 AND HORROR SPINOFF FOR THE TRENCH(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)With over $1.14 billion earned at the global box office, Aquaman became the highest-grossing DC Comics movie (worldwide) ever in early 2019, even above The Dark Knight (though Joker came close to beating Aquaman at $1.063 billion).&nbsp; That was quite an achievement for a character long considered a joke (including a long-running story arc on HBO’s Entourage). Those numbers also made it super obvious that Aquaman would get a sequel and that’s exactly what’s happening, with one of the first film’s screenwriters now working on the sequel. Aquaman director James Wan is on board as producer, but it’s unclear as to whether he will also direct the sequel. Warner Bros didn’t stop there, though, as they also hired two “newbie” screenwriters to work on a horror movie spinoff for The Trench,&nbsp;about the ” deadly amphibious creatures seen attacking the hero and his love, Mera” in Aquaman. The main characters from Aquaman are not expected to appear in The Trench, which suggests that the “horror movie” may instead focus on surface dwellers who come into contact with the monsters separate from any involvement with Atlantis.MARCH: CAST ANNOUNCED FOR CHRISTOPHER NOLAN’S AMBITIOUS ACTION MOVIE TENET(Photo by JA, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Although we obviously knew what Dunkirk was about way before release (the title gives it away), director Christopher Nolan also has a history of starting his movies with mystery premises (we’re thinking here of Inception and Interstellar&nbsp;in particular). In March, pretty much the only thing we knew about Nolan’s next film (revealed in May to be called Tenet) was that Warner Bros had scheduled it for release on July 17, 2020 (up against Bob’s Burgers: The Movie). In March, we learned that Nolan had cast John David Washington (Denzel’s son and the star of Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman) as the film’s lead, as well as Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki (Ayesha from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2). Since then, the cast has expanded to include Kenneth Branagh, Clémence Poésy (In Bruges), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Quicksilver in Avengers: Age of Ultron), and frequent Nolan collaborator Michael Caine. Most recently, the first trailer for Tenet debuted online just last week in a surprise move from Warner Bros., and it included a six-minute prologue preview attached to IMAX screenings of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.APRIL:&nbsp;SHAZAM! 2 TAKES OFF, AND DWAYNE JOHNSON GETS BLACK ADAM GREENLIGHT TOO(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)After this year’s&nbsp;Shazam!&nbsp;had only been in theaters for a week, Warner Bros. went ahead and announced that they were moving forward with plans for a sequel, even despite the film opening much lower ($53 million domestically) than similar movies like Captain Marvel ($153 million)&nbsp;and Aquaman ($67.8 million). We don’t know the premise of the sequel yet, but the mid-credits tease give a clue about the possible villain. A few weeks ago, we learned that Shazam! 2 is now scheduled for release on April 1st, 2022. This news came after Dwayne Johnson’s long-in-development Black Adam movie (based on the popular Shazam! villain) will start filming soon and is scheduled for release on December 22, 2021. The timing suggests that the Black Adam movie might directly lead to Dwayne Johnson also reprising the role in Shazam! 2. Warner Bros. is also directly positioning Shazam! 2 against Marvel movies, as Sony’s Spider-Verse sequel comes out a week later (4/8/2022) and Black Panther II comes out a month later (5/6/2022), followed by&nbsp;DC Super Pets on 5/20/2022.MAY: ROBERT PATTINSON TAKES OVER THE BATMAN(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Although some superhero movies are “slow burns” when it comes to news, others, especially the biggest movies (Avengers, or in this case, Batman) can happen in what feels like a relatively brief amount of time. Specifically, just eight months ago, we knew nothing about who would be in the 2021 reboot The Batman (6/25/2021). That all started to change in mid-May, beginning with the news that the shortlist included Nicholas Hoult and Robert Pattinson, the latter of whom secured the role two weeks later. In the meantime, details started to trickle forth about who the villains in The Batman would be. In September, as the Joker hype express was well under way, it was confirmed that there were no plans&nbsp;for Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker to crossover with Robert Pattinson’s Batman (which is not to say that the Joker won’t be in Batman movies, just not Phoenix’s specific version). Two weeks later, there was talk about Jonah Hill possibly taking on a villain role, which ultimately didn’t work out, as both the Penguin and Riddler went to other actors. In October, Paul Dano (Love and Mercy) landed the role of the Riddler&nbsp;and Zoe Kravitz became the next actress to portray Selina Kyle, A.K.A. Catwoman. Last month, The Batman found two more of its ensemble cast members as Colin Farrell (who also played the villain Bullseye in Daredevil) was cast as the Penguin, and Andy Serkis was cast as Bruce Wayne’s butler, Alfred Pennyworth. And lastly, there was also news last month suggesting that Warner Bros. might give villains like Catwoman, The Penguin, and The Riddler their own Joker-style spinoff movies.JUNE: DISNEY BEGINS CASTING LIVE-ACTION THE LITTLE MERMAID(Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images)Walt Disney Pictures has yet to announce a release date (or even a release year) for its live-action remake of The Little Mermaid, but we can be fairly certain that&nbsp;it’s actually happening, because the studio made lots of “splashes” about it this year. Going into July, we had already known for a while that The Little Mermaid will be directed by Rob Marshall&nbsp;as his next Disney project after last year’s Mary Poppins Returns. The casting news started in late June with word that Melissa McCarthy was in early talks to play the evil, tentacled sea witch Ursula. (It’s not yet known if Ursula will be fully CGI, or possibly part live action with animated tentacles.)&nbsp; This was soon followed by the casting of Awkwafina (Ocean’s Eight) and Jacob Tremblay (Room) as the voices of the animated animal characters Scuttle the seagull and Flounder (who’s not a flounder), respectively. Next up — and again, this was all basically in the same week — was the casting of Ariel herself, who will be played by R&amp;B singer Halle Bailey, who, with her sister Chloe,&nbsp;makes up the singing group Chloe x Bailey. For a while, Harry Styles of One Direction was also in talks to play the romantic lead Prince Eric, but that role ultimately went to relatively unknown actor&nbsp;Jonah Hauer-King.JULY:&nbsp;MARVEL MAKES MASSIVE PHASE FOUR ANNOUNCEMENT AT COMIC-CON(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)In recent years, Marvel Studios has sometimes stayed relatively quiet at San Diego Comic-Con, but that was definitely not the case in 2019, when they had arguably the biggest superhero movie news event of all time. Part of the reason for that has to do with the way that Phase Four will involve not just movies, but also various shows on the Disney+ streaming service as well. Without getting into every detail (since doing so would involve a column as long as this one for the entire year), we’ll just mention that the (movie) announcements included: Black Widow (5/1/2020), The Eternals (11/6/2020), Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2/12/2021), Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (5/7/2021), Thor: Love and Thunder (11/5/2021), Blade (presumably Phase Five), Fantastic Four (Phase 5), and X-Men (Phase 5). In August, we also found out that Kit Harrington will be joining The Eternals as long-time Avengers member Black Knight, and that Black Panther II is scheduled for May 6, 2022.AUGUST: GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S STAR-STUDDED&nbsp;NIGHTMARE ALLEY CASTS UP(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)After years and years of attempts to get several different projects off the ground, director Guillermo del Toro is ultimately using his post-Shape of Water clout to get something completely different going,&nbsp;namely a remake of the 1947 carnival thriller Nightmare Alley (Fresh at 100%). By the time August rolled around, seven-time Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper had already been attached for the role originally played by Tyrone Power for&nbsp;some time, but that month, we finally saw the casting of two of his female co-stars. Cate Blanchett, who’s a seven time Academy Award nominee and two time winner (for Blue Jasmine and The Aviator) ultimately landed a key supporting role, while Toni Collette, who received an Academy Award nomination herself for&nbsp;The Sixth Sense, secured the female lead role of the psychiatrist and hypnotist who teams up with Cooper’s carnival con man. Later, in September, a key role also went to Rooney Mara. Fox Searchlight is expected to schedule Nightmare Alley sometime in prime “awards season” in late 2020.SEPTEMBER:&nbsp;SONY AND MARVEL COME TO TERMS ON SPIDER-MAN DEAL(Photo by Sony Pictures)You may remember that last summer, there was a big uproar about the fact that talks between Sony Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures (and their Marvel Studios) had fallen apart over future Spider-Man movies starring Tom Holland within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Reportedly, Disney and Marvel had wanted a 50% cut of future Spider-Man movies in exchange for Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios working on the movies for Sony. After all of the attention and feedback from the fans, the relevant parties started up talks again, resulting in the big news in September&nbsp;that Sony and Marvel would indeed work together on a third solo Spider-Man film starring Tom Holland,&nbsp;to be released on July 16, 2021 and directed by Jon Watts, who directed the first two. The financial compromise calls for Disney to receive 25% of the film’s profits (leaving 75% for Sony), down from their original request of 50%. As part of the new deal, Tom Holland will also appear as Spider-Man in one more MCU movie, the title and premise of which hasn’t been revealed yet.OCTOBER: JOHN WICK&nbsp;IS GETTING HIS OWN CINEMATIC UNIVERSE(Photo by @ Lionsgate)When John Wick was first released in 2014, it became something of a pop culture phenomenon that helped Keanu Reeves stage a mid-career comeback and led to two sequels (thus far) and continuing box office success. Lionsgate scheduled John Wick: Chapter 4 for release on May 21, 2021 a while ago, and in October, we learned that Lionsgate is not limiting their John Wick plans to just Keanu Reeves movies. Instead, the studio is moving forward with plans for a female-centric John Wick spinoff called Ballerina about “a young female assassin who seeks revenge against the people who killed her family.” Although the premise doesn’t specify a nationality for the Ballerina, there is something of a trope involving Russian ballerinas who become super spies or assassins (mainly we’re thinking here of both Red Sparrow and Marvel’s Black Widow). The Ballerina character was briefly seen in John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum, played by newcomer Unity Phelan, but it’s possible/likely that another actress will star in Ballerina. And then, earlier this month, Warner Bros. effectively did something huge that raised the profile of John Wick: Chapter 4 at the same time as it directly competed with it, announcing that&nbsp;they had scheduled their own Keanu Reeves sequel, The Matrix 4, for May 21, 2021, the same release date as John Wick: Chapter 4. Both Carrie-Anne Moss and Reeves are attached to return in their roles as Trinity and Neo in&nbsp;that film.NOVEMBER:&nbsp;SPIDER-VERSE 2 AND&nbsp;BLACK PANTHER II ANNOUNCED FOR 2022(Photo by Sony Pictures)As mentioned above, Marvel Studios put on a big, big panel at San Diego Comic-Con this past summer, but the dates were only specific for 2020 and 2021. Since then, Marvel has also announced a release date of May 6, 2022 for Black Panther II, but November’s biggest news story painted an image of 2022 that promises an ambitious slate comparable to that of 2019. Sony Pictures has confirmed plans for a second animated movie starring the Miles Morales version of the web-crawler as seen in last year’s Academy Award-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The Spider-Verse sequel is now scheduled for April 8, 2022, just shy of a month before Black Panther II&nbsp;on May 6, 2022. Although they’re not yet dated, two other Marvel movies that might be scheduled for 2022 are the Blade reboot starring Mahershala Ali and the Fantastic Four movie mentioned at Comic-Con that would finally bring Stan Lee’s original Marvel super team into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As for what we might see in Spider-Verse 2, the final scenes of the first movie did hint at both Spider-Man 2099 and the finger-pointing Spider-Man ’67.DECEMBER:&nbsp;KUMAIL NANJIANI’S ETERNALS&nbsp; BODY BLOWS UP THE INTERNET LIKE BABY YODA(Photo by @kumailn/Instagram)Like any Marvel Cinematic Universe movie with pretty much an entirely new cast, next year’s The Eternals (11/6/2020) has been the focus of multiple casting news stories this year. Individually, we’re not sure any of them would have been enough to make our list of top stories for the year. And then, Kumail Nanjiani posted the images you can see on his Instagram account. When Nanjiani was first cast in&nbsp;The Eternals, it was probably safe to assume that he would basically look like the Kumail Nanjiani we’ve grown accustomed to seeing in other projects like The Big Sick, Stuber, and HBO’s Silicon Valley, so it was something of a shock to see him looking absolutely shredded.&nbsp;His co-stars in The Eternals&nbsp;include Angelina Jolie (Thena), Salma Hayek (Ajak), Gemma Chan (Sersi), and Game of Thrones stars Richard Madden (Ikaris) and Kit Harrington (The Black Knight), but we haven’t heard yet about whether they’re that buff yet. Also, yeah, this December has been kind of a slow news month.Like this?

The fourth MCU movie on the schedule awaiting release (after Black Widow, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and Eternals) will be the not-yet-titled third Spider-Man movie (12/17/2021) starring Tom Holland. Just last week, that movie was the focus of the surprising news&nbsp;that Jamie Foxx will be reprising his role as Electro from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (starring Andrew Garfield, not Tom Holland). We now know that Benedict Cumberbatch will also be appearing in the next Spider-Man as Spidey’s Avengers teammate Doctor Strange, which we’ll actually end up seeing before Cumberbatch’s own sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (3/25/2022). That title, plus the Jamie Foxx news and the recent WandaVision trailer is leading to speculation that the MCU is heading towards some sort of alternate reality, timey-wimey criss-cross of dimensions and properties (Marvel Studios has to get the X-Men and Fantastic Four characters re-introduced at some point,&nbsp;too, after all). In related news, Natalie Portman was also quoted this week about her return as Jane Foster&nbsp;in Thor: Love and Thunder (2/11/2022), which appeared to confirm previous speculation about which popular Marvel Comics storyline the movie will be (at least partly) based on.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;A&nbsp;DON’T BREATHE SEQUEL HAS ALREADY BEEN FILMED(Photo by Ghost House Pictures)A few months after the release of the horror thriller Don’t Breathe in 2016, the news first broke that the producers were quickly working on developing a sequel, but it wasn’t until earlier this year that a director had signed on for it. The word at that point was that filming was scheduled to start in April, but that was also before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted pretty much the entire film and television industry. That is, of course, in the United States (and many other places where movies are frequently filmed), but just like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, movies (sometimes) find a way. It was just last month that we found out that Sacha Baron Cohen had secretly filmed a Borat sequel (which will debut on Amazon), and this week, Stephen Lang took to his Twitter account to reveal that he has wrapped filming of the Don’t Breathe sequel in Belgrade, Serbia. Don’t Breathe 2 was directed by Rodo Sayagues, who served as the screenwriter for director Fede Alvarez on both his Evil Dead remake (Fresh at 62%)&nbsp;and the first Don’t Breathe (Certified Fresh at 88%).2.&nbsp;ALLISON WILLIAMS TO STAR IN BLUMHOUSE THRILLER M3GAN(Photo by ©Universal Pictures)Before 2017, Allison Williams had a few claims to fame, including being one of HBO’s Girls, NBC’s Peter Pan Live!, and anchorman&nbsp; Brian Williams’ daughter, but for many, she is best known as the girlfriend from Jordan Peele’s blockbuster psychological horror film&nbsp;Get Out (Certified Fresh at 98%). That movie was produced by Blumhouse Productions, the company behind such horror and thriller franchises as The Purge, Insidious, Sinister, Happy Death Day, and Paranormal Activity, and recent hit movies like Halloween and The Invisible Man. Allison Williams is set to reunite with Blumhouse on a technology-based horror thriller film called M3GAN whose premise is similar to&nbsp;the recent reboot of&nbsp;Child’s Play. Williams will play a “brilliant roboticist” who invents a “a life-like doll programmed to be a kid’s greatest companion and a parent’s greatest ally.” M3GAN will be directed by Gerard Johnstone (Housebound, Certified Fresh at 95%) from a screenplay by Akela Cooper (one of the producers of Netflix’s Luke Cage), based on a story idea by James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring, Aquaman), who is also co-producing along with Jason Blum. Akela Cooper also co-wrote Wan’s upcoming horror film Malignant, which was filmed pre-COVID-19 and is now awaiting its release, probably sometime in 2021.3.&nbsp;SANDRA OH TO STAR IN SAM RAIMI-PRODUCED HORROR FILM UMMA(Photo by Michael Tackett/©Warner Bros.)Stage 6 Films is a Sony-based production company that since 2008 has given us movies like Don’t Breathe, Robot &amp; Frank, Searching, and the Insidious franchise (co-produced with Blumhouse). This week, Stage 6 made a deal with Sam Raimi’s production company to acquire the rights to a supernatural horror film called Umma, with Sandra Oh attached to star (and serve as the film’s executive producer). “Umma” is the Korean word for “mother,” and the story will depict Oh’s character living on a farm in the U.S. with her daughter until their lives are disrupted by supernatural events following the arrival of her mother’s remains from Korea. Umma will be the first film produced by Sam Raimi under a new deal with Starlight Media, whose recent productions include Crazy Rich Asians and Midway. Sandra Oh&nbsp;currently stars on the BBC America series Killing Eve, for which she won a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and three Emmy nominations, following ten seasons on Grey’s Anatomy, for which she received five Emmy nominations. Oh’s co-stars in Umma will include Fivel Stewart, MeeWha Alana Lee, Dermot Mulroney, Odeya Rush, and Tom Yi.4. BILLY CRUDUP TO PLAY BARRY ALLEN’S DAD IN THE FLASH(Photo by Julio Macat/©Sony Pictures Classics)By its very nature, Justice League had a huge ensemble cast, but some of the actors were uncredited, including Billy Crudup (who played Dr. Manhattan in director Zack Snyder’s Watchmen) as Henry Allen, the father of Barry Allen, A.K.A.&nbsp;The Flash. We can now report that Crudup will reprise that character&nbsp;in The Flash (11/4/2022), the long-in-development solo movie starring Ezra Miller as the Justice League super speedster. Crudup is actually returning to The Flash after previously being attached to co-star as Harry Allen (in 2015, years before Justice League came out) but then dropping out when that version of the movie was sent back to “development hell.”&nbsp;He is the third male star beside Ezra Miller to be announced for The Flash, following Michael Keaton&nbsp;and Ben Affleck, who will be playing different versions of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The Flash will adapt the popular Flashpoint storyline from the comics, during which the Flash attempts to prevent his mother’s murder, resulting in changes to both time and reality. (The Flashpoint story was also adapted for season 3 of the the CW series The Flash ). It’s not yet known if Billy Crudup’s character will receive more screen time in next year’s HBO Max mini-series Zack Snyder’s Justice League.5.&nbsp;ANDY SAMBERG HEADLINES SUPERHERO STONER COMEDY&nbsp;SUPER HIGH(Photo by ©Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)Superhero movies and stoner comedies are some of the most popular films for certain swaths of the moviegoing audience, so it makes a certain kind of sense when the two genres intersect. With that in mind,&nbsp;Andy Samberg, Craig Robinson, and Common are teaming up for a superhero stoner comedy&nbsp;called Super High, which New Line Cinema won the rights to this week following a “competive situation.” Super High will be set in a world where “smoking special weed gives you super powers.” The Super High screenplay will be written by Adam Mansbach, the screenwriter of the 2016 Barack Obama drama Barry (Certified Fresh at 80%), and also the author of the New York Times bestselling book, Go the F*ck to Sleep, and its sequels, You Have to F*cking Eat and F*ck, Now There are Two of You (the audiobooks of which were narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, Bryan Cranston, and Larry David).6.&nbsp;CLINT EASTWOOD TO PRODUCE, DIRECT, AND STAR IN&nbsp;CRY MACHO(Photo by Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros.)When Daniel Day-Lewis announced that he was retiring from acting in 2017 after his final film Phantom Thread, he had just recently turned 60 years old. We bring that up because Clint Eastwood just announced this week that he will be starring in the next film he will direct, and he’s currently 90 years old. Put another way, if Clint Eastwood had retired when he was 60 (in 1990), we never would have seen him in movies like Unforgiven, In the Line of Fire, Million Dollar Baby, or Gran Torino. The Warner Bros. movie that Clint Eastwood will be producing, directing, and starring in is an adventure drama called Cry Macho, which is an adaptation of a 1975 novel that has been in development as a screenplay since the early 1970s because author N. Richard Nash actually wrote the book&nbsp;after his initial attempt to sell it as a screenplay.&nbsp;Other actors who were previously attached to star in the film&nbsp;include Roy Scheider in the 1990s and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the early 2010s. In the 1980s, Eastwood himself was also in the running to star, but he decided to make&nbsp;The Dead Pool instead.&nbsp;Cry Macho will tell the story of a “washed-up horse trainer who schemes to make $50,000 by snatching a streetwise Mexican boy from his mother in Mexico City and delivering him to his father — and the trainer’s ex-boss — in Texas.”7. ANGELINA JOLIE AND CHRISTOPH WALTZ TO STAR IN TRAGIC ALS ROMANCE(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)This year’s “awards season” is obviously curtailed a bit because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Hollywood appears to be chugging right along,&nbsp;with various projects that sound like they might be future awards-friendly features. That theme especially applies to Every Note Played, a romantic drama to be produced by STX Films based upon the novel of the same title by Lisa Genova. Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds, Alita: Battle Angel) is in talks to star in Every Note Played as a famous concert pianist who has been diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease, the same disease that afflicted Stephen Hawking), with Angelina Jolie also in negotiations to play his ex-wife, who assumes the role of his caregiver as his condition worsens. Every Note Played will be directed by Michael Sucsy, whose filmography includes Grey Gardens (Fresh at 88%) and The Vow (Rotten at 31%). In related news, the fantasy adventure Come Away, starring Angelina Jolie and David Oyelowo, was picked up this week by a new distribution company called Relativity Media Studio.8.&nbsp;CAST OF RESIDENT EVIL ORIGIN MOVIE REVEALED(Photo by Ben Rothstein/©Marvel/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)In 2002, Milla Jovovich starred in the first live-action movie adapted from the popular Resident Evil video game franchise, and the film’s success led to five more sequels, even as the movies moved farther and farther from both the tone and the plotline of the actual Resident Evil video games. Jovovich and her husband, director Paul W.S. Anderson, have moved on from Resident Evil&nbsp;(taking on another video game franchise with Monster Hunter instead), but the Resident Evil&nbsp;franchise forges ahead. The reboot will start with an origin story that will depict the initial viral outbreak at the Umbrella Corporation in Raccoon City that then leads to the apocalyptic events of the video games (and presumably, future movies with some of the new cast). The reboot draws heavily from Resident Evil for its characters, including Jill Valentine (Hannah John-Kamen), Chris Redfield (Robbie Amell), Claire Redfield (Kaya Scodelario), Leon Kennedy (Avan Jogia), Albert Wesker (Tom Hopper), and William Birkin (Neal McDonough).9. ZOMBIE MOVIE DIRECTOR TAKING ON KID-FRIENDLY THOMAS &amp; FRIENDS TRAIN MOVIE(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/©Paramount Pictures)Marc Forster directed 2013’s zombie thriller World War Z, and the 2016 South Korean zombie horror hit Train to Busan&nbsp;was set on a train; combine the two together and remove the zombies, and what do you get? Probably something along the lines of the next Thomas &amp; Friends&nbsp;movie, which Forster has, for some reason, signed on&nbsp;to direct. Successful directors frequently helm a variety of projects, true, but it’s fun to point out that Thomas the Tank Engine will be brought to us next by the guy who did Machine Gun Preacher.&nbsp;Anyway, Thomas &amp; Friends will be co-produced by the toy and game company Mattel, which is also actively developing movies based on Barbie (probably starring Margot Robbie) and Barney the Dinosaur (produced by Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya).On an Apple device?

If it was the former, however, Sigourney Weaver definitely messed up those plans this week. The original Alien turned 40 last month, so as part of that, Weaver spoke to Parade about it, and also revealed not only that she’s returning as Dana Barrett in the upcoming Ghostbusters movie, but also that “It’s going to be crazy working with the guys again.” Now, we don’t know for sure who “the guys” she’s referring to are, but the way most writers are interpreting it is that she was speaking about the surviving original Ghostbusters. Harold Ramis died in 2014, and Rick Moranis has spoken out repeatedly about why he chose to pass on&nbsp;Ghostbusters. Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Bill Murray, however, already all returned for the 2016 reboot, so they all seem likely to be “the guys” Sigourney Weaver was referencing. Sony Pictures has scheduled Ghostbusters 3&nbsp;for July 10, 2020, up against The Purge 5. The new Ghostbusters cast members will include Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, and Carrie Coon.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN REPLACING DICAPRIO, PART 1:&nbsp;BRADLEY COOPER AND NIGHTMARE ALLEY(Photo by John Baer/Rogue Pictures)We see this more with directors, the most successful of whom frequently have more projects than they can actually make, but there are also some major movie stars who are consistently linked to several films at once. Leonardo DiCaprio is absolutely in that field, and this week, we learned of two of DiCaprio’s former projects going to other actors in his stead. Less that two months ago, the news broke that Leonardo DiCaprio was going to team up with Guillermo del Toro on his first film as director since his Best Picture winner, The Shape of Water. Although an exact reason isn’t being given, DiCaprio’s agents failed to reach a deal with Fox Searchlight for that film, a remake of the creepy 1947 carnival drama Nightmare Alley (Fresh at 100%). Instead, it’s now Bradley Cooper who is in talks for the male lead in Nightmare Alley as a carnival “carnie” who teams up with a female psychiatrist to improve his mentalist act and his ability to rip off people.2.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN REPLACING DICAPRIO, PART 2:&nbsp;SAM ROCKWELL AND RICHARD JEWELL(Photo by Fox Searchlight)DiCaprio had also previously been attached to star in Clint Eastwood’s next film as director, Richard Jewell (previously titled The Ballad of Richard Jewell), but his role has now gone to Sam Rockwell instead. The title refers to a security guard who discovered a suspicious backpack bomb at the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. Rockwell will play Jewell’s defense attorney, and the title role is going to Paul Walter Hauser, who was arguably the breakout star of I, Tonya. (At one point, that role would have gone to Jonah Hill, when he was physically much heavier.)&nbsp;The cast for the film expanded even further this week, though, as Kathy Bates will also be co-starring as Jewell’s mother. In related news, Paul Walter Hauser also signed on this week for a lower profile film, Silk Road, which is also based on a true crime story.3.&nbsp;NETFLIX ADAPTING HIT VIDEO GAME THE DIVISION WITH JESSICA CHASTAIN AND JAKE GYLLENHAAL(Photo by JA, Jason Smith/Everett Collection)There are so many Marvel movies (over 30 if you include the various Sony and Fox movies) that it’s rare to find a big star who hasn’t appeared in at least one of them. Jessica Chastain co-starred as an alien in last week’s Dark Phoenix, and Jake Gyllenhaal will play Mysterio in next month’s Spider-Man: Far from Home, and we now know that they will both headline an upcoming video game movie. Both of them actually joined the movie based on Tom Clancy’s The Division three years ago, but that was so long ago that, until this week, it didn’t seem like a sure thing that either was still attached. The big reveal this week is that Netflix has stepped in to produce and distribute The Division, which will be the next film directed by David Leitch, who’s coming off Certified Fresh action hits in&nbsp;Atomic Blonde (78%) and Deadpool 2 (83%). Tom Clancy’s The Division is an action role-playing game set in New York City following a mass genocide from a viral attack.4.&nbsp;NETFLIX ENLISTS COCO WRITER FOR THEIR TAKE ON CHRONICLES OF NARNIA(Photo by Walt Disney courtesy Everett Collection)Ostensibly inspired by the box office successes of both the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings movies, Walden Media started adapting C.S. Lewis’ The Chronicles of Narnia in 2005 with The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. That first movie was a box office smash ($745 million globally), but the second (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian) and third (The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader) both dropped by nearly half with $419 million and $415 million, respectively. (The third film also dipped the franchise into Rotten territory.) Disney released the first two films, and Fox the third, but nine years later, Netflix now has the rights. To get things started, Netflix has hired screenwriter Matthew Aldrich (who cowrote Pixar’s Coco, Certified Fresh at 97%) to work on their ambitious adaptations of Lewis’ seven novels into both movies and at least one series.5. MELISSA MCCARTHY’S ST. VINCENT REUNION THE STARLING(Photo by JA/Everett Collection)Like many comic actors, Melissa McCarthy frequently dips her cinematic toes into more dramatic fare (like last year’s Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Certified Fresh at 98%). McCarthy arguably started doing this in 2014 with the “dramedy” St. Vincent (Certified Fresh 77%), co-starring Bill Murray, Naomi Watts, and Chris O’Dowd. St. Vincent was directed by Ted Melfi (Hidden Figures), who had planned to direct a psychiatric dramedy called Fruit Loops (with Woody Harrelson) next, until Disney recently let it go as part of their new Fox plans. Quickly shifting gears, Melfi will instead next direct a tragic comedy&nbsp;called The Starling, with McCarthy and O’Dowd reuniting from St. Vincent as a married couple struggling with grief.6.&nbsp;BO BURNHAM&nbsp;WILL WRITE&nbsp;THE NEW SESAME STREET MOVIE’S SONGS&nbsp;(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Although January is historically seen as a “dump month,” studios have more recently been enjoying success with the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend in mid-January (Glass in 2019, Hidden Figures in 2017, Ride Along 2 in 2016, etc.). Warner Bros. is developing a Sesame Street musical starring Anne Hathaway, and they chose a release date of January 15, 2021 (which would have been MLK’s 92nd birthday) a while back. Filming isn’t expected to start until April of next year, and this week, we found out who will be writing the new Sesame Street songs. That role has gone to comedian-turned-writer-director Bo Burnham, who is coming off a great 2018 after his award-winning feature directorial debut with teen drama Eighth Grade (Certified Fresh at 99%). As pointed out in this piece, Burnham made an early mark on YouTube by performing “raunchy” songs like “My Whole Family Thinks I’m Gay,” but it’s pretty obvious that his Sesame Street songs won’t be like that. Or so we assume.7.&nbsp;CLASSIC HORROR FILM BLACK CHRISTMAS GETTING REMADE (AGAIN)(Photo by MGM courtesy Everett Collection)Possibly more than any other genre, horror movies are particularly&nbsp;ripe for remakes, mostly because they can be made relatively affordably with a high potential box office return. In 2006, one such remake was Black Christmas (Rotten at 15%), based on the influential early 1974 slasher of the same title (Fresh at 71%). Both films featured young actresses as sorority house members who later became more famous: Margot Kidder (Superman) in the original film, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (10 Cloverfield Lane, TV’s Fargo) in the remake. Blumhouse Productions and Universal Pictures are rushing to remake Black Christmas again, and the lead actress this time around will be Imogen Poots, who co-starred in 2016’s Green Room. We say “rushing” because Universal has scheduled Black Christmas for just six months from now (December 13, 2019), up against the&nbsp;Jumanji sequel. The updated film will be directed by Sophia Takal, who co-wrote the script with April Wolfe, which gives the remake a unique female perspective that might be exactly the jolt it needs.Rotten Ideas2. KEVIN HART REMAKING BILL MURRAY’S SCROOGED(Photo by Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures)Bill Murray’s zombie comedy The Dead Don’t Die is in theaters this weekend, and he’s all over The Weekly Ketchup as well. This is the third story with Murray connections, following Ghostbusters 3 and The Starling (which is a reunion project for St. Vincent, in which Bill Murray starred). Although they don’t always “hit” financially, remakes remain popular with Hollywood because many of them can be made relatively affordably (compared to say, superhero movies), but still have name brand familiarity. In 1988, Bill Murray starred in Scrooged (Fresh at 70%), which was itself basically a remake (more specificially a reimagination) of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. Well, that remake is going to get a remake, because Kevin Hart is producing and is expected to star in&nbsp;a Scrooged remake for Paramount Pictures. The Scrooged remake does not yet have a screenwriter or director, so it’s probably at least a few Christmases away.1.&nbsp;ANIMATED SPICE GIRLS MOVIE IN THE WORKS(Photo by Columbia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Last year marked the 20th anniversary of the 1998 Spice Girls movie, Spice World&nbsp;(Rotten at 35%), which unironically had absolutely nothing to do with Frank Herbert’s Dune (melange jokes for the win). As with all mortals, time marches on even for the Spice Girls, but Paramount Pictures has figured out a way to make another Spice Girls movie: animation. All five original Spice Girls members are signed on to star in the new animated film, which will feature both their hit songs and new songs as well. The Spice Girls movie is part of a new Paramount Animation slate&nbsp;that aims to release two movies a year, starting in 2020 with The SpongeBob Movie: It’s a Wonderful Sponge (5/22/2020) and the comic book adaptation Rumble (7/31/2020). Paramount is also still developing an animated Mighty Mouse movie. This story isn’t the week’s Rotten Idea for those films, however, but because of&nbsp;Spice World‘s Tomatometer score.Like this?

Meanwhile, another player (from another sport) continues to make the news as he transitions from Cleveland to Los Angeles, creating a lot of sweet movie deals in the process. LeBron James doesn’t make his Lakers debut until October 18th, but he already has 10 projects in development in both TV and film. The highest profile of these has, for a few years now (since 2015), been the planned Space Jam sequel, teaming James with the various Looney Tunes characters the same way Michael Jordan did in the 1996 family film. To get things going, LeBron is&nbsp;working with Ryan Coogler, the director of Black Panther and&nbsp;Creed, who will serve as one of the producers on Space Jam 2. Terence Nance of HBO’s Random Acts of Flyness will direct Space Jam 2 when it starts filming in 2019 after the&nbsp;upcoming NBA season ends. Warner Bros. will distribute Space Jam 2&nbsp;probably in 2020. It’s not yet known what other current NBA stars LeBron James is hoping to recruit to join him and the returning Looney Tunes all-stars (or who might be the “Bill Murray,” if not the actor himself).Fresh Developments1. THIS WEEK IN MARVEL: THE ETERNALS, TV SHOWS FOR LOKI AND SCARLET WITCH, AND KEVIN FEIGE OVERSEEING X-MEN(Photo by Marvel Studios)Marvel Studios is such a force to be reckoned with that, in some weeks,&nbsp;they could easily&nbsp;dominate half the Weekly Ketchup. This week, we’re going to group all of the Marvel news into one story. We’ll start with the just-breaking news that the summer-long director search for The Eternals has settled upon indie film director Chloe Zhao (The Rider, Songs My Brothers Taught Me). Zhao is following a similar path as previous Marvel choices (like the directors of Thor: Ragnarok and next year’s Captain Marvel). Her take on The Eternals will reportedly focus on a romance between Ikaris and Sersi (who, in the comics, was a longtime member of the Avengers in the 1990s). We also learned from Disney CEO Bob Iger this week&nbsp;that Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige will oversee Fox’s various Marvel properties (X-Men, Fantastic Four, etc) going forward. On the (streaming) TV front, Marvel and Disney are also now preparing spinoff solo shows for both Loki and Scarlet Witch (it’s unknown if they will be prequels or sequels to the movies). Those shows on Disney’s upcoming streaming service are separate from ABC, which is reportedly developing a “female Marvel superheroes” series that is being written by Allan Heinberg (Wonder Woman). On top of that, there was also that big first trailer for next year’s Captain Marvel&nbsp;(3/8/2019), and all of the things that we think we may have learned from it.2.&nbsp;JAMES BOND 25 WILL BE THE FIRST IN THE SERIES WITH AN AMERICAN DIRECTOR(Photo by James Atoa/Everett Collection)Over the course of the 24 “official” James Bond films to date, there have been many different takes on the character and the franchise, and several different actors playing him as well, including Daniel Craig, who is returning for James Bond 25. One constant, however, has been that the movies have always been directed by Brits. That all changed this week with the news that the search to replace Danny Boyle has ended with the hiring of director Cary Fukunaga (Jane Eyre, Sin Nombre; HBO’s True Detective), who was at one point attached to direct last year’s horror hit IT (he retained a writing credit on that film). James Bond 25 had been scheduled for 2019, but that was delayed when Boyle departed as director. With Fukunaga hired, James Bond 25 is now scheduled for release&nbsp;on February 14th, Valentine’s Day, 2020. It’s not yet known if that date was chosen because of any inherent romantic plot or if it’s just an example of counter-programming. The other major sequel currently scheduled for February 14, 2020 is Reese Witherspoon’s Legally Blonde 3. Other directors that had been previously mentioned as possibilities were Edgar Wright (Baby Driver), Jean-Marc Vallee (Dallas Buyers Club), and Yann Demange (White Boy Rick). It’s also not known if Said Taghmaoui (Wonder Woman) will still be cast as one of the James Bond 25 villains.3. MICHAEL B. JORDAN RECRUITED FOR TOM CLANCY’S RAINBOW SIX FRANCHISE(Photo by Marvel Studios)It was just last week that Michael B. Jordan’s (Creed, Black Panther) name was floated out as a possible Superman replacement following Henry Cavill’s likely departure. This week, however, we learned that it’s a very different franchise that Michael B. Jordan is now joining, with the news that he’s signed with Paramount to star in a new series inspired by novels by Tom Clancy. Clancy’s most famous movie character is Jack Ryan, but there have long been plans to also adapt another character, CIA operative John Clark. Clark has been a supporting character in the past (played by both Willem Dafoe and Liev Schreiber), but Michael B. Jordan’s take on the character will be clearly in a lead role. The plan is reportedly to start with an “origin story” adaptation of Without Remorse, which would then be followed by an adaptation of Rainbow Six, which has already become a popular video game series.4.&nbsp;PATRICK STEWART ALSO PLAYING A BOSLEY IN CHARLIE’S ANGELS REBOOT(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)As details emerged about Elizabeth Banks’ planned reboot of Charlie’s Angels, one of the changes was that the Townsend Agency is now an international “security and intelligence service.” This week, we learned that this means that each location will also have its own “Bosley,” with Elizabeth Banks playing one, and an esteemed Star Trek and X-Men actor playing another. That actor is Patrick Stewart, whom we learned last month&nbsp;has also signed on to reprise his role of Jean-Luc Picard in an upcoming new Star Trek series. The three new Angels that Banks and Stewart will be playing Bosleys to were already announced as being Kristen Stewart (Twilight), Naomi Scott (Disney’s new Jasmine in next year’s Aladdin), and newcomer Ella Balinska. Sony Pictures has scheduled this new Charlie’s Angels reboot for a year from next week, on September 27, 2019.5. DC COMICS MOVIES BIRDS OF PREY AND JOKER CASTING UP(Photo by Kerry Hayes/EuropaCorp USA, Chuck Zlotnick/Focus Features)Last week’s big movies concerning DC Comics movies had to do with the likely departures of Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck as Superman and Batman. That doesn’t mean, however, that the studio is slowing down, as other projects continue to be developed and produced at a faster pace than they had been previously. Aquaman and Shazam! (via New Line Cinema) are both wrapped, and Wonder Woman 1984 and Joker are both filming, with Birds of Prey and The Flash in preproduction. Margot Robbie is already signed and announced to reprise her role as Harley Quinn in Birds of Prey, but that leaves her teammates Black Canary, Huntress, and Detective Renee Montoya yet to be cast. Warner Bros is now testing actresses for each role, with the goal being to sign them by September 30th, so they can train for the January start of filming. The Black Canary actresses include Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Belle, A Wrinkle in Time) and Jurnee Smolett-Bell (TV’s Underground), and possibly Janelle Monáe (Hidden Figures) as well. For Huntress, Warner Bros is considering Mary Elizabeth Winstead (10 Cloverfield Lane, Scott Pilgrim vs the World), Margaret Qualley (HBO’s The Leftovers), and Cristin Milioti (whose Star Trek-inspired Black Mirror episode won an Emmy this week). Justina Machado, who stars in Netflix’s One Day at a Time reboot, is one of the actresses who tested for Renee Montoya. In other casting news, Warner Bros has also cast Shea Whigham (Boardwalk Empire) in Joker, and has replaced Alec Baldwin as Batman’s father Thomas Wayne with LOST costar Brett Cullen.6.&nbsp;JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT AND&nbsp;JAMIE FOXX GETTING CATFISH-ED BY NETFLIX(Photo by Chris Helcermanas-Benge/Summit Entertainment, Ron Batzdorff/New Line Cinema)Although the 2010 documentary (and related TV show spinoff) Catfish became part of the decade’s new lingo, that film’s directors otherwise mostly produce horror and thriller films like Paranormal Activity 4 and 2016’s Nerve. Like many directors, Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman are making the transition to Netflix, where they will direct an untitled science fiction movie about “a drug epidemic that gives people a range of superpowers.” The film sounds like it has an ensemble cast, with a female lead yet to be cast, but this week, both Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon-Levitt signed on for roles. Jamie Foxx will play “a family man who has suffered a great loss and is desperate to trace the drug’s supply line and find its designer,” while JGL will play “a beat cop who takes law enforcement matters into his own hand.” Hopefully, this take on superpowers from the Catfish directors will earn a better Tomatometer score than recent similar Netflix movies like Bright (27%) and The Cloverfield Paradox (17%).7.&nbsp;AUBREY PLAZA AND BRIAN TYREE HENRY JOIN&nbsp;CHILD’S PLAY REBOOT(Photo by FilmDistrict courtesy Everett Collection, Curtis Baker/FX)MGM has one of the oldest and largest back catalogs still operating in Hollywood, and for the past decade, much of their output has been reboots and remakes of old titles. Since 2008, that has included The Taking of Pelham 123, Fame, Carrie, Hercules, Poltergeist, Ben-Hur, RoboCop, The Magnificent Seven, Death Wish, Tomb Raider, Overboard, and next month’s A Star is Born. Well, MGM apparently isn’t going to stop doing this anytime soon, with the news this week that production will soon start on the remake of the 1988 horror hit Child’s Play, which led to the five movies of the “Chucky” series. Child star Gabriel Bateman will be Chucky’s new friend, Aubrey Plaza (Legion, Parks and Recreation) will play his mom, and they’ll also be joined by Atlanta co-star Brian Tyree Henry. The Child’s Play reboot is being directed by Norway’s Lars Klevberg (Polaroid), and you can see the first glimpse at the new Chucky doll right here. The first&nbsp;Child’s Play&nbsp;was&nbsp;Fresh&nbsp;at&nbsp;67%, and though the sequels were all Rotten in the 23%-46% range, this remake offers an opportunity to right the ship, and the cast is a promising start.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK2.&nbsp;EDDIE MURPHY’S OLD ENOUGH NOW TO STAR IN GRUMPY OLD MEN?(Photo by Bruce McBroom/DreamWorks)If you want another clue that Hollywood’s definition of “old” isn’t necessarily the same as most everyone else’s, consider this week’s news about a planned return to Grumpy Old Men. When that film came out in 1993, its stars were 68-year-old Jack Lemmon and 73-year-old Walter Matthau. Even if one allows for a few years before the film is actually produced, Eddie Murphy is currently only 57.&nbsp; Of course, Murphy has played characters of all ages (such as in Nutty Professor II: The Klumps) in the past, so perhaps that’s what’s going on here. The Hollywood Reporter is calling the planned reboot a remake of Grumpy Old Men, while Variety says it’s just “inspired by” it, as does&nbsp;Deadline. Eddie Murphy’s director on&nbsp;the movie will be Tim Story, whose Tomatometer has been entirely Rotten since 2002’s Barbershop (if one doesn’t count Kevin Hart concert films).1.&nbsp;BRYAN SINGER&nbsp;MAY NEXT DIRECT RED SONJA REMAKE(Photo by Alan Markfield/20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Last December, director Bryan Singer (X-Men, The Usual Suspects) was fired by 20th Century Fox from their Freddy Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, reportedly because he repeatedly didn’t show up to set. In the same week, however, there were also reports about a lawsuit related to sexual assault allegations from 2003. Eventually, Singer’s directing credit on Bohemian Rhapsody was confirmed, and the film is still scheduled for November 2nd, 2018. Millennium Films is now reportedly in talks&nbsp;with Singer for their remake of Red Sonja (15%), which has been in development for over a decade now. (Coincidentally, Rose McGowan, who is one of the key figures behind the #metoo movement was once attached to co-star in Red Sonja). The blog reactions were uniform this week, including from sources like Collider and SyFy Wire. We’re just going to say that a remake of a 15% misfire like Red Sonja is a “Rotten Idea” anyway.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"cinemax, telelvision, Arts, Amazon","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/22133753/Space-Jam-2-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"lebron-james-teams-up-with-ryan-coogler-for-space-jam-2-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509187606902","title":"Chris Evans Is Done With Captain America After Avengers 4, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Chris Evans Is Done With Captain America After Avengers 4, and More Movie NewsThe Conjuring inspires another spinoff, Michael Bay leaves as Transformers director, and we'll get new biopics for Dock Ellis and 2 Live Crew.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 16, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Avengers 4, The Crooked Man, X-Men: Dark Phoenix, and new biopics about Dock Ellis and 2 Live Crew.This WEEK’S TOP STORYCHRIS EVANS HANGING UP CAPTAIN AMERICA’S SHIELD AFTER AVENGERS 4 IN 2019(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Earlier this year, there was some intimation from Chris Evans that he might soon be hanging up his shield as Marvel’s Captain America. However, there were also statements — like this —&nbsp;that&nbsp;muddied the waters. Now two months later, Chris Evans is speaking more authoritatively on the issue, confirming the fourth Avengers movie (May 3, 2019) will be his last film as Captain America. &nbsp;“I had six films in my Marvel contract, so I could have said after the third Avengers I was done, but they wanted to make the third and fourth Avengers films as a two-parter,” Evans said. “They said they had so many other characters to fit in…&nbsp;and couldn’t get them all into one movie. [I agreed] because it made sense. It’s going to wrap everything up.” (Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel is scheduled for release in between Avengers: Infinity War and the fourth Avengers movie on March 8, 2019.)Fresh Developments1. JESSICA CHASTAIN IN TALKS TO CO-STAR&nbsp;IN X-MEN: DARK PHOENIX(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures)In 2006, when Fox adapted the fan favorite Dark Phoenix Saga from 1980 as&nbsp;X-Men: The Last Stand, broad changes were made, including the deaths of two major characters, and the absence of any of the&nbsp;cosmic characters and settings in the comics. Fox is now preparing to retell the story as X-Men: Dark Phoenix (11/2/18), and Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty,&nbsp;Interstellar) is&nbsp;in talks to co-star as Empress Lilandra of the Shi’ar Empire, described as the&nbsp;film’s “villain.” We’ve put that word in quotes because in the comics, Lilandra not only becomes an X-Men ally, but after a lengthy romance, she marries Professor X! Speaking of Charles Xavier, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, and other recent X-Men cast members are in talks to return for Dark Phoenix (Evan Peters as Quicksilver is a notable exception), which will be directed by Simon Kinberg. Game of Thrones‘s Sophie Turner is set to star&nbsp;in X-Men: Dark Phoenix&nbsp;as the titular character.2. THE CONJURING GETS THIRD HORROR SPINOFF THE CROOKED MAN(Photo by New Line Cinema)As other studios are struggling to set up their own “cinematic universes” — The Mummy and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&nbsp;come to mind — New Line Cinema appears to be building one more organically. The studio&nbsp;first spun off Annabelle from The Conjuring (its sequel,&nbsp;Annabelle: Creation, opens in August), and a second spinoff called&nbsp;The Nun is scheduled for next summer, on July 13, 2018. In last year’s&nbsp;The Conjuring 2, Patrick Wilson’s Ed Warren (based on a real-life paranormal researcher) experiences a terrifying encounter&nbsp;with a creature called the “Crooked Man,” and we now know that, like Annabelle and&nbsp;The Nun,&nbsp;The Crooked Man will be getting his own film. New Line Cinema has hired screenwriter Mike Van Waes, who is also working on a Wizard of Oz horror movie (yes, really), to write it.&nbsp;The Crooked Man doesn’t have a director or a release date yet, but we’d guess that it could be out sometime in 2019.3.&nbsp;TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT WILL BE MICHAEL BAY’S LAST TRANSFORMERS (AS DIRECTOR)(Photo by Michael Germana/Everett Collection)After four movies with Rotten Tomatometer scores, we generally include Transformers news in the “Rotten Ideas of the Week”. All of the franchise’s films thus far have been&nbsp;directed by Michael Bay, who, with the exception of 1996’s The Rock, has an even longer streak of Rotten scores. So, why would we suddenly include a&nbsp;Transformers-related story in&nbsp;“Fresh Developments”? Earlier today, Fandango.com published a series of video interviews with Michael Bay in which he confirmed that, after Transformers: The Last Knight, he will be stepping away from the franchise as a director (he will continue to produce them for Paramount). Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings) will direct next summer’s Bumblebee spinoff (starring Hailee Steinfeld and opening on 6/8/18), but Paramount has yet to announce a director for Transformers 6, which is scheduled for release on June 28, 2019.4. SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING STAR TOM HOLLAND “ACCIDENTALLY” CONFIRMS TRILOGY PLANS(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures)We’ve known for a while that Marvel Studios signed Tom Holland for six movies when he was cast to play the new Spider-Man in last year’s Captain America: Civil War and this summer’s Spider-Man: Homecoming. Considering Marvel has made (or will soon make) trilogies for a number of its characters, this week’s news should surprise pretty much no one. While talking to a reporter in France, Tom Holland “accidentally” confirmed that there will be a third Spider-Man movie, saying, “There will be a Spider-Man 2 and 3… yeah well, now you know, sorry Marvel. Whoops!” (Of course, that could have been completely planned.) Holland will play Peter Parker in Spider-Man: Homecoming (7/7/17), next year’s Avengers: Infinity War (5/4/18), and 2019’s untitled Avengers 4.5. CLASSIC BATMAN COMPOSER DANNY ELFMAN TAKES OVER JUSTICE LEAGUE SCORE(Photo by Steven Ferdman/Everett Collection)Earlier this year, we learned through a series of revelations that Joss Whedon (Marvel’s Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron) was moving on to direct DC Comics adaptations for Warner Bros. In addition to an eventual Batgirl movie, Whedon will first take over for director Zack Snyder on this November’s Justice League, following an unfortunate tragedy in Snyder’s family. Although it’s not the way&nbsp;anyone would have wanted it to happen, Whedon’s move to Warner Bros seems to be bringing a change in tone. After the success of Wonder Woman, the five keywords for DC Comics movies will reportedly be&nbsp;“heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism.” We also learned composer Tom Holkenborg, aka Junkie XL (Mad Max: Fury Road, Deadpool), has left Justice League, and in his place, the film will now be scored by Danny Elfman, who might be most famous for his work with&nbsp;Tim Burton and the theme song of&nbsp;The Simpsons.6. ICE CUBE AND SON TO COLLABORATE ON DOCK ELLIS BIOPIC(Photo by Warner Bros.)Even if you’re not a sports fan, you may have heard the story of baseball pitcher Dock Ellis. On June 12, 1970, while pitching for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Dock Ellis threw a no-hitter, which is a very rare, very difficult feat, but made all the more remarkable by his (admittedly disputed) admission years later that he was high on LSD at the time. It’s so remarkable, in fact, that someone was bound to make a movie about it, and that someone is rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube, aka O’Shea Jackson, who has signed on to&nbsp;produce a Dock Ellis biopic with his son O’Shea Jackson Jr. attached to star as Ellis. The younger&nbsp;Jackson starred in 2015’s hit biopic Straight Outta Compton, playing his father. Dock Ellis died in 2008 at the age of 63 after struggling with liver disease.7. MICHELLE MONAGHAN TO RETURN TO THE FRANCHISE WITH&nbsp;MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 6(Photo by Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)Much has been made this week of the&nbsp;box office disappointment&nbsp;of&nbsp;The Mummy&nbsp;(domestically, at least), but it’s not all doom and gloom for Tom Cruise’s future. The trailer for his awards season release&nbsp;American Made&nbsp;(9/29/17)&nbsp;came out recently, he’s&nbsp;been talking up&nbsp;Top Gun: Maverick, and he’s&nbsp;signed to star in the&nbsp;Edge of Tomorrow&nbsp;sequel&nbsp;Live Die Repeat and Repeat. That would be a lot for most movie stars, and yet, there’s more. Cruise recently began filming of the sixth&nbsp;Mission: Impossible&nbsp;movie (7/27/18), and this week, we learned the cast&nbsp;will feature the return of a fan favorite. After co-starring in&nbsp;MI:3&nbsp;and popping up in a cameo in&nbsp;MI: Ghost Protocol,&nbsp;Michelle Monaghan&nbsp;is now confirmed&nbsp;to return for&nbsp;Mission: Impossible 6. Monaghan joins a cast that includes new addition Henry Cavill and returning cast members Alec Baldwin, Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames.8. 2 LIVE CREW TO BE NEXT RAP PHENOMENON WITH ITS OWN BIOPIC, THE BOOK OF LUKE(Photo by Dimension Films courtesy Everett Collection)Following the success 2015’s N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton, we’ve heard some&nbsp;plans for other biopics based on famous rappers (like this week’s All Eyez on Me, and its 27 percent Tomatometer score). Next up&nbsp;is Luther Campbell (and 2 Live Crew), with a project at Lionsgate called The Book of Luke. RJ Cyler, who played the Blue Ranger in this year’s Power Rangers, will play Campbell in this film, which is expected to focus on the precedent-setting legal battle that took&nbsp;2 Live Crew all the way to the Supreme Court. Biopics are commonly made posthumously — the aforementioned Tupac Shakur, for example, and The Notorious B.I.G., the subject of 2009’s Notorious —&nbsp;but just for the record, Luther Campbell is still very much alive.&nbsp;Until recently, the once-controversial recording artist was&nbsp;coaching high school football in Miami.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1.&nbsp;DODGEBALL DIRECTOR SIGNS ON FOR CANNONBALL RUN REMAKEA&nbsp;little over a year ago, we heard about Warner Bros.’ plans to remake the 1981 hit comedy The Cannonball Run, and at the time, Get Hard writer/director Etan Cohen was attached to it.&nbsp;As of this week, though, Warner Bros. has attracted a new screenwriting team and a new director. Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant (of the Night at the Museum franchise) are now in talks to pen&nbsp;the Cannonball Run remake, as is director Rawson Thurber (Central Intelligence, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story). The original Cannonball Run&nbsp;(which received a sequel in 1984) was an ensemble comedy about assorted teams racing across the United States — think It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or&nbsp;Rat Race —&nbsp;that featured such stars as Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, the recently departed Sir Roger Moore, Jackie Chan, Farrah Fawcett, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr.&nbsp;It’s also remembered today for being one of the first movies with an extended “gag reel” during the credits (which you can watch right here).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Society, awards, Hulu, Film, Pop, Hallmark, science","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16163740/Chris-Evans-Captain-America-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"chris-evans-is-done-with-captain-america-after-avengers-4-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509185882471","title":"Thor: Ragnarok Director Wanted for Live-Action Akira, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Thor: Ragnarok Director Wanted for Live-Action Akira, and More Movie NewsLinda Hamilton returns to the Terminator franchise, and new roles for Tom Hanks, Gal Gadot, Bradley Cooper, Elisabeth Moss, and Matt Damon.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 22, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering such titles as Akira, The Croods 2, Terminator 6, and new roles for Gal Gadot, Matt Damon and Tom Hanks.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHOR: RAGNAROK DIRECTOR TO BRING ANIME CLASSIC AKIRA TO LIFE(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)The trailers for this November’s Thor: Ragnarok (11/3/17) promise a colorful, kaleidoscopic adventure hybrid of fantasy, science fiction, and obviously, superheroism. The director responsible is New Zealand’s Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople), and his&nbsp;talent has attracted the attention of Warner Bros., who have&nbsp;long been trying to get a live-action remake of Akira going. Waititi is now in talks to direct an adaptation of the long-running manga, intended to be two films, each adapting three of the classic manga books. The Akira manga was previously adapted as a 1988 anime film&nbsp;which now regularly appears on “greatest movies of all time” lists. Warner Bros.’ ongoing efforts have led to some controversy.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;THE CROODS SEQUEL IS STILL EVOLVING AFTER ALL(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Nearly a year ago, there were reports that DreamWorks Animation had pulled the plug on plans for a sequel to their 2013 animated caveman hit The Croods (71% on the Tomatometer), which was, at one point, scheduled for this coming December 22. Well, fans of The Croods can celebrate again, because DreamWorks has put The Croods 2 back into production. The new release date for The Croods 2 is September 18, 2020, with Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Catherine Keener, Ryan Reynolds, and the rest expected to return. DreamWorks has also scheduled an animated Blumhouse movie called Spooky Jack for a year later, on September 17, 2021.2. TOM HANKS TO STAR IN REMAKE OF SWEDISH HIT A MAN CALLED OVE(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)There is something of an ongoing “golden age” in publishing for Scandinavian authors like Jo Nesbo (The Snowman), and the late Stieg Larsson’s continuing Millennium series (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc). Similarly,&nbsp;Fredrik Backman’s novel&nbsp;A Man Called Ove&nbsp;was adapted into&nbsp;a hit 2015 film. Since the release of the film, the novel’s English language adaptation has become a&nbsp;best-seller in the USA. The story, about a curmudgeonly man whose heart of ice is thawed by new neighbors, is&nbsp;about to reach an even larger audience, as Tom Hanks has come on board to both produce and star in a new English-language film adaptation of A Man Called Ove.3. MATT DAMON TO PLAY NOTORIOUS CONMAN&nbsp;IN CHARLATAN(Photo by Paramount Pictures)As we near the heat of this year’s “awards season,” Matt Damon finds himself&nbsp;starring in movies from two directors associated with 2011’s The Descendants. That film’s director, Alexander Payne, has the upcoming sci-fi satire Downsizing, while its star, George Clooney, directed the crime drama Suburbicon from a screenplay co-written by the Coen brothers. One of Damon’s next films will be called Charlatan, adapting the true story of early 20th century conman John R. Brinkley, as told in the bestselling 2008 book Charlatan: America’s Most Dangerous Huckster, the Man Who Pursued Him, and the Age of Flimflam.&nbsp;Decades before pills like Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis, Brinkley pretended to be a doctor who could cure male impotence by surgically transplanting goat testicles into his unsuspecting patients.4.&nbsp;THE HANDMAID’S TALE STAR ELISABETH MOSS JOINS ABORTION DRAMA CALL JANE(Photo by Take Five/Hulu)Elisabeth Moss won the Emm for Best Actress in a Drama on Sunday night for her role in The Handmaid’s Tale, and by Monday, she had landed her next major film role. Moss will star in Call Jane, an indie drama set in 1960s Chicago about an underground initiative called the&nbsp;Jane Collective, which provided abortions to women in the years before the Roe v. Wade ruling of 1973. Call Jane will be directed by Simon Curtis, whose previous films based on true stories have included My Week with Marilyn, Woman in Gold, and the upcoming Winnie the Pooh film Goodbye Christopher Robin.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK5.&nbsp;WONDER WOMAN STAR GAL GADOT JOINS BRADLEY COOPER DEEPER UNDERWATER(Photo by Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures, John Baer/Rogue Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)It’s becoming increasingly difficult to find major movie stars who haven’t joined a&nbsp;superhero franchise at some point in their careers.&nbsp;This story, for example, involves DC’s Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot, and Bradley Cooper, the voice of Marvel’s Rocket [Raccoon] from Guardians of the Galaxy. Gadot is in early talks with MGM to co-star in an underwater thriller called Deeper, in which Cooper is attached to star “as a disgraced astronaut who is on a deep-sea dive exploring a newly discovered trench but soon finds himself confronted by a sinister and dangerous force.” We’re calling Deeper a “Rotten Idea” because of screenwriter Max Landis’ long string of Rotten Tomatometer scores,&nbsp;among other things related to Max Landis.4. MARK WAHLBERG REUNITES WITH DADDY’S HOME DIRECTOR FOR&nbsp;INSTANT FAMILY(Photo by Patti Perret/Paramount Pictures)Mark Wahlberg’s 2015 comedy Daddy’s Home (with Will Ferrell) earned a Rotten score of just 31%, and some of the reactions to the Daddy’s Home 2 trailer have been sort of borderline vicious&nbsp;(NSFW). Even so, Mark Wahlberg appears to be perfectly happy with the work relationship with Sean Anders, because he will work with the Daddy’s Home franchise director on another similar “family” comedy. The project is called Instant Family, and the premise involves a couple who decide to use the foster children system to create a family for themselves overnight.3. DAVE BAUTISTA TO CO-STAR IN TWO ESCAPE PLAN SEQUELS WITH SYLVESTER STALLONE(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Earlier this year, the news broke that Dave Bautista (Marvel’s Drax) would be joining his Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 costar Sylvester Stallone in a sequel to 2013’s Escape Plan (49% on Rotten Tomatoes). That movie, now called Escape Plan 2: Hades, isn’t expected to be released until sometime in 2018, but Escape Plan 3 has already started filming. Dave Bautista will be returning for Escape Plan 3: Devil’s Station as well, and he will be joined by franchise newcomers Jaime King and China’s Max Zhang.2. KINGSMAN DIRECTOR BLAMES FLASH GORDON ON MARVEL’S GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Director Matthew Vaughn’s new film Kingsman: The Golden Circle (49% on Rotten Tomatoes) comes out this weekend, and so he’s doing all of the usual rounds of press. Speaking to Collider, Matthew Vaughn was asked about his planned remake of Flash Gordon, and he had a surprising reaction. Vaughn said, “For me, the only problem with Flash Gordon is Guardians [of the Galaxy] kind of stole what I would have liked to have done with it.” Matthew Vaughn joined the Flash Gordon reboot in 2015, after the 2014 release of the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out in 2014, so ostensibly, he’s referring to something that happened in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Might his plan for Flash Gordon&nbsp;have involved Ming the Merciless being his dad or something? Or was there something more obvious that Marvel “stole” from Flash Gordon?1. LINDA HAMILTON WILL BE BACK FOR THIRD TERMINATOR REBOOTWhen 2015’s Terminator: Genisys barely made more than half its production budget in the USA ($89 million vs $155 million), the second attempt at a reboot seemed to be the end of the Terminator franchise. Even so, talk of a Terminator 6 lingered in the last two years (mostly from Arnold Schwarzenegger). On Tuesday (in an event that was teased online last week), James Cameron announced that he will producing a sixth Terminator movie (the third reboot), which will feature the return of Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. About 60-year-old Linda Hamilton headlining Terminator 6, James Cameron said, “There are 50-year-old, 60-year-old guys out there killing bad guys… but there isn’t an example of that for women.” We’re calling this the Rotten Idea of the Week based on the Tomatometer scores&nbsp;and box office results of the last two Terminator movies.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Red, Arts, archives, streaming, Academy, Premiere, Max, Amazon, Esquire, Black, cinemax, scorecard, spain","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/22142030/Taika-Waititi-Akira-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"thor-ragnarok-director-wanted-for-live-action-akira-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509179211045","title":"Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Movie Development News of 2018","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Movie Development News of 2018A month-by-month round-up of the best news to come out of Hollywood this year.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 28, 2018 |  CommentsFew industries enjoy taking really, really long extended holiday vacations quite like Hollywood, and when we get to this time of the year, there’s rarely much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss. So, this week and next, we’re going to review 12 of the year’s top stories, presented to you in monthly chronology. The year-in-review begins with the “Fresh Developments” which here also serve (mostly) as the “Top Stories” of the year.JANUARY:&nbsp;BLACK WIDOW&nbsp;MOVIE FINALLY&nbsp;ANNOUNCED(Photo by Marvel Studios)Marvel Studios hasn’t had a big slate announcement since 2014, and we didn’t get one in 2018 either, but project-by-project, this may have been the biggest such year since. It started in January with confirmation that a solo Black Widow was now, finally, in development. Black Widow continued to receive a steady stream of news stories, as the director shortlist started at 60 in May, was narrowed in June to just three, and led up to Australian director Cate Shortland landing the job in July. We also learned in October that Scarlett Johansson will receive a $15 million pay equity with her male co-stars&nbsp;for Black Widow, in the same week that Black Panther 2 moved forward in development. Other Marvel Studios movies that made the news this year included Ms. Marvel (A.K.A. Kamala Khan), The Eternals, and earlier in December, both Doctor Strange 2, and Shang-Chi: Master of Kung-Fu. &nbsp;FEBRUARY:&nbsp;GAME OF THRONES SHOWRUNNERS GET THEIR OWN STAR WARS PROJECTS&nbsp;(Photo by Steve Granitz/Getty Images)Just a few months after the November, 2017 news that Star Wars: The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson was developing a new Star Wars trilogy (after next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX), we learned about another set in February. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the showrunners of HBO’s popular Game of Thrones, are now writing and producing at least one film, a trilogy, or several films in the Star Wars universe, though the nature of their project has yet to be&nbsp;confirmed. Having said that, the popular rumor as of this writing suggests movies based on the popular Knights of the Old Republic setting, which is best known for inspiring a series of video games. Something that we didn’t know in February (and Lucasfilm and Disney probably didn’t know this either) was that Solo: A Star Wars Story would turn out to be a box office disappointment, prompting Disney to slow down or outright cancel most of their “prequel spinoff” Star Wars Story projects. That development presumably puts the new Rian Johnson and Benioff/Weiss projects even closer to production than they have otherwise been.MARCH:&nbsp;AVA DUVERNAY&nbsp;INVOKES DC COMICS’ THE NEW GODS&nbsp;(Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/Paramount Pictures)In late 2017, director Ava DuVernay (Selma, A Wrinkle in Time) revealed on Twitter that her favorite superhero was Big Barda of DC’s New Gods, a comic created by former Marvel artist and Stan Lee collaborator Jack Kirby. In March, we learned that she may have been teasing talks that she had either started or was considering having, because DuVernay is now developing a New Gods movie. Warner Bros. attempted to develop an animated New Gods movie back in the late 1990s, and though the project was never realized, it now looks like it’ll happen after all, and the studio has brought DuVernay on board to direct it. No screenwriter has been named yet, but Warner Bros. will obviously be making that next hiring a priority. This piece suggests why Ava Duvernay is potentially a great choice for The New Gods, and this one explains who some of these characters are, exactly.APRIL:&nbsp;A BIG YEAR FOR STEVEN SPIELBERG: BLACKHAWK, INDIANA JONES 5, WEST SIDE STORY, THE COLOR PURPLE(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Director Steven Spielberg had a huge year in announcements, partly buoyed by the Certified Fresh release of Ready Player One in March. It actually started off in January with confirmation of his (previously already talked about) plans for Indiana Jones 5 and his remake of West Side Story. The first big new project this year, though, came in April, when Spielberg started development at Warner Bros. of a Blackhawk movie, based on the long-running comic about a squad of World War II pilot-adventurers. West Side Story also had a few big casting announcements this year, including Ansel Elgort as Tony, and original West Side Story star Rita Moreno, not as Anita, but as a reimagined take on neighborhood shopkeeper “Doc.” We also found out last month that Steven Spielberg is partnering with Oprah Winfrey on a musical remake of The Color Purple.MAY:&nbsp;ANNABELLE: CREATION AND HAPPY DEATH DAY&nbsp;SEQUELS ANNOUNCED(Photo by New Line Cinema)Superhero movies (like Avengers: Infinity War and Aquaman) are obviously crushing it right now at the box office, but they also tend to have pretty big budgets. Horror films do well, too, and they’re a lot cheaper to produce. One such example is New Line Cinema’s The Conjuring franchise, which includes the “creepy doll” spinoff Annabelle and its prequel Annabelle: Creation. The Conjuring 3 doesn’t come out until 2020 (9/11/2020), but we learned in May that Annabelle 3 (7/3/2019) was likely to beat it to release. The Blumhouse horror production company also quickly moved forward with plans for Happy Death Day 2U, the sequel to last year’s $123 million Groundhog Day-like hit. We also learned in October that the Warrens (based on the real paranormal investigators) will be joining one of the non-Conjuring films in the franchise for the first time, as Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga will reprise their roles in the third Annabelle movie.JUNE:&nbsp;THIS YEAR IN STEPHEN KING: DOCTOR SLEEP, FIRESTARTER, AND THE CASTING OF IT CHAPTER TWO(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection, Warner Bros.)Although 2017 was obviously not a great year for The Dark Tower (Rotten at 16%), the success of the other major Stephen King movie last year drastically offset it. IT was both Certified Fresh at 85%&nbsp;and a tremendous box office hit, earning $700+ million worldwide from a budget of just $35 million. This made Stephen King- sourced projects hot properties again, especially if they’re remakes (like Pet Sematary, 4/5/2019), or otherwise related to a pre-existing horror classic. That “otherwise” leads us to Doctor Sleep, the 2013 novel by King that&nbsp;serves as a sequel to The Shining because it focuses on the adult Danny Torrance. That role went to Ewan McGregor, with King himself reportedly having given his blessing to the choice for the sequel, which will be directed by Mike Flanagan (Ouija: Origin of Evil, Gerald’s Game). Also in June, we learned that Universal Pictures is remaking Stephen King’s Firestarter, with the directing job going to Turkish-German director Fatih Akin (Goodbye Berlin, Soul Kitchen), with Blumhouse also co-producing. Finally, there’s IT: Chapter Two (9/6/19), and this week, we saw our first images from the set. 2018 was a big year for IT: Chapter Two (9/6/2019) casting news, including the confirmation of Jessica Chastain in February, and the news in April that James McAvoy (Split, X-Men: First Class) and Saturday Night Live alumnus Bill Hader had been cast in lead roles (as Bill and Richie, respectively).JULY:&nbsp;STAR-STUDDED LITTLE WOMEN REMAKE TO BE GRETA GERWIG’S NEXT(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)One of the biggest stories coming out of last year’s awards season was the underdog success of actress-turned-director Greta Gerwig’s semi-autobiographical Lady Bird (Certified Fresh at 99%) starring Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet (whose Call Me By Your Name also did well). For her next film, Gerwig is turning to classic literature, in the form of Little Women. Gerwig also attracted some major star power for her version, including Ronan and Chalamet, as well as Meryl Streep. Emma Stone was initially cast as Meg, but dropped out to allow her time to promote The Favourite, so the role went to another Emma, Emma Watson. In August, Jurassic Park and Blue Velvet star Laura Dern also signed on. Little Women is now scheduled for release in just under a year, on Christmas Day, 2019 (up against Call of the Wild, the World War I drama 1917, and Melissa McCarthy’s Super Intelligence).AUGUST:&nbsp;SHHH…. JOHN KRASINSKI IS NOW WRITING A QUIET PLACE 2 FOR 2020(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer/Paramount)In late August, Paramount Pictures announced A Quiet Place 2 (title pending) for release on May 15, 2020, which currently puts it up against Warner Bros’ Scooby reboot and a week before another monster movie, Godzilla vs Kong (also from Warner Bros). Almost immediately, it was clear that Paramount was going to want to return to the first film’s premise (about monsters that are super sensitive to sound), given that it made over $332 million from a $17 million budget. John Krasinski gave an update in October, stating that after initially telling Paramount to hire someone else, he is now actively working on writing the sequel. It’s not yet known if Krasinski and his wife Emily Blunt will also be returning to star in the sequel. Emily Blunt is following up Mary Poppins Returns with another film for Disney, their attraction adaptation Jungle Cruise, which is scheduled for release&nbsp;on July 24, 2020.SEPTEMBER:&nbsp;HENRY CAVILL LIKELY OUT AS SUPERMAN, SIGNALING BIG DCEU CHANGES(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)The DCEU (DC Extended Universe) hit a major snag in September&nbsp;with the news that Henry Cavill is most likely done playing Superman. Instead, the focus in the “Superman Family” will be on his cousin, Supergirl, whom we learned in August&nbsp; is getting her own movie. The talks with Cavill reportedly broke down over a Superman cameo in next year’s Shazam! (4/5/2019). Warner Bros.’ upcoming DC Comics projects also include Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker (10/4/2019), Margot Robbie’s Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) (2/7/2020), and Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman 1984 (6/5/2020). Many pieces went online speculating about the future of DC Comics movies.&nbsp;Even without Superman on his slate anymore, Henry Cavill is expected to be keeping very busy anyway, as he also signed with Netflix this year to star in&nbsp;their video game adaptation series&nbsp;The Witcher.OCTOBER: JAMES GUNN&nbsp;SWITCHES SIDES FOR DC COMICS’ SUICIDE SQUAD SEQUEL(Photo by Marvel Studios)One of the most shocking stories in recent memory came in July when Disney fired director James Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 over a number of questionable tweets from before his original hiring for 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy. In October, we learned that that Gunn is now signed to write, and possibly direct&nbsp;the sequel to DC Comics’ Suicide Squad. Gunn is supposedly working on a “completely new take,” which suggests it could even be a reboot instead of a true sequel to the first film. One reason to believe that is that, in the past, Gunn has tweeted negatively about Jared Leto, suggesting that he may not be in a hurry to recast Leto as Joker in James Gunn’s Suicide Squad.NOVEMBER:&nbsp;GUILLERMO DEL TORO REVEALS OVER 15 BIG MOVIES READY TO GO(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Long before Guillermo del Toro won the Academy Award for Best Picture this year for The Shape of Water, it was well known that he had a long list of shelved movies in his past. That little golden man on his mantle has changed a lot for GDT, including his new deal at Fox Searchlight that basically set him up with his own mini-studio for horror/genre films. In November, del Toro took to Twitter to list over 15 unproduced screenplays that he has completely finished, which are basically “ready to go” projects for any studio that wants to work with him to get them produced. (You can read a summary of that list in our coverage last month right here.) Del Toro also made the news in August for producing Scary Movies to Tell in the Dark, and in October for landing his Pinocchio at Netflix.DECEMBER:&nbsp;INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE&nbsp;SUCCESS INSPIRES SPINOFFS AND SEQUELS&nbsp;(Photo by Sony Pictures Animation)After just two weeks in release, Sony’s innovative animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 97%) has already earned nearly $150 million globally. The film was always part of Sony’s ambitious plans for its Marvel properties, and last week, we leaned a lot more about possible future films. Development had already reportedly begun in November on both a sequel and a spinoff&nbsp;of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The animated sequel will focus on the romance between Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, which will then lead into the spinoff Spider-Women, featuring Gwen, Silk, and the original Spider-Woman (in the comics), Jessica Drew. These two animated films join a growing slate of Marvel movies at Sony that also includes Venom 2, Morbius (AKA The Living Vampire), Black Cat, Silver Sable, Kraven the Hunter, Jackpot, Nightwatch, and Silk.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"poppins, TBS, Academy, TLC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23184647/Indiana-Jones-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"yearly-ketchup-the-freshest-movie-development-news-of-2018"},{"id":"47509196293573","title":"Hasbro Announces Cinematic Universe Centered On G.I.

Joe, Plus More Hollywood HeadlinesKurt Russell joins the Guardians of the Galaxy, Katherine Waterston joins Alien, and Vin Diesel keeps the Riddick franchise alive.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 18, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such movies as Alien: Covenant, the Bride of Frankenstein remake, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, and Bubbles (about Michael Jackson’s pet chimp).This Week’s Top StoryG.I. JOE TO STAR IN A NEW “HASBRO CINEMATIC UNIVERSE”Ever since Marvel Studios hit upon box office success with their string of films, the term “cinematic universe” has become one of the Holy Grails of major Hollywood film development. “Cinematic Universe” refers to a setting that is shared by multiple films (and in Marvel’s case, TV shows), which provides a sense of continuity, but is also pretty great for “franchises.” In various stages of development, there are now cinematic universes for DC Comics, Universal’s Classic Monsters, 21 Jump Street/Men in Black, and even Robin Hood’s Merry Men. The toy company Hasbro arguably already has one in the form of Transformers (and its upcoming spinoffs and prequels). This week, Hasbro announced that some of their other toy brands will also be coming together in a new cinematic universe centered around G.I. Joe. (at least at first).&nbsp;G.I. Joe will be joined by Micronauts (tiny aliens and robots who see our world as a planet of giants), ROM: Spaceknight (who’s also a popular Marvel Comics character), M.A.S.K. (another paramilitary group not unlike G.I. Joe), and Visionaries (their subtitle Knights of the Magical Light says it all, pretty much). (You can find another guide to these characters in this article). It’s not yet known how the various characters will be combined and/or featured, or in what order, but it seems likely that the first film will focus on G.I. Joe (with other characters possibly introduced as well, ala Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). Hasbro has been known to be working on a Micronauts movie for some time now, so for many comics fans, the big news in all of this is the notion of a ROM: Spaceknight movie. As part of a licensed deal with Hasbro, Marvel Comics published 75 issues of ROM: Spaceknight from 1979 to 1986, and the character remains one of Marvel’s most popular “cosmic” characters, especially among older fans. Marvel can’t use ROM: Spaceknight and Micronauts in their own movies because they’re licensed characters, but it looks like that won’t mean they won’t get their own movies, eventually.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;BIOPICS DOMINATE THIS YEAR’S “BLACK LIST”, LED BY… BUBBLES THE CHIMP?Since 2005, “The Black List” has been an annual survey of Hollywood insiders appraising the current batch of unproduced screenplays that are actively in development. Since this is a weekly column about film development, the Black List is most definitely one of our “big deals” here. Well, the 2015 edition arrived this week, and the quickest take away we can give you is that “biopics” and other “true story” scripts did very, very well, representing 4 (or 5) of the top 10 screenplays, including the #1 and #2 spots. Those scripts are called Bubbles and Stronger, and they tell the stories of Michael Jackson’s pet chimp (who serves as the film’s narrator), and Jeff Bauman, one of the survivors of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Two baseball biopics also made the top ten: Rocket* (about baseball pitcher Roger Clemens and his disqualification from being a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame), and True Fan (about Steve Bartman, the Chicago Cubs fan who was accused of costing the team their first pennant since 1945). Other screenplays involving real people are Reagan (a fictional comedy), White Boy Rick (a successful 1980s Detroit drug kingpin), All the Money in the World (the Getty kidnapping case), The Virginian (young George Washington), Mayday 109 (JFK during WWII), Nyad (swimmer Diana Nyad), Hunting Eichmann (about the Nazi fugitive), Battle of New Orleans (Andrew Jackson and the War of 1812), and Chappaquiddick (see below).2. KURT RUSSELL “EYED” TO PLAY STAR-LORD’S DAD IN GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2We still don’t know who Star-Lord’s dad is (and really, at this point, do we want to?).&nbsp; However, the people at Marvel Studios certainly do, and when they think of him, the guy they want to play him is Kurt Russell. That’s right, if Marvel can make the deal, the same actor who starred in Escape from New York, John Carpenter’s The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, and is currently in Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight, will also be joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel has been stepping up their casting game recently, with their latest “big get” being Cate Blanchett, who will costar in Thor: Ragnarok. Marvel Studios has scheduled Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 for May 5, 2017.3.&nbsp;SCARLETT JOHANSSON TO MOVE THAT BODYScarlett Johansson is currently in talks with Sony Pictures to star in an R-rated comedy called Move That Body. Described as a cross between The Hangover and Weekend at Bernie’s, the comedy is about five friends who accidentally kill a male stripper at their bachelorette party, and so they have to dispose of the body. (A more specific comparison&nbsp; would be to 1998’s Very Bad Things, but Hollywood publicists almost always go with “popular” over “precise” with their analogies.)&nbsp;Move That Body was written by Broad City participants Lucia Aniello (director) and Paul W. Downs (writer/actor), and Downs is also expected to costar in the movie.4.&nbsp;KATHERINE WATERSTON IS THE NEXT ALIEN FRANCHISE LEADEver since Sigourney Weaver starred in the first Alien, there have been later female roles that joined the Alien franchise, such as those played by Sanaa Lathan and Noomi Rapace, that begged inevitable comparisons. With the Prometheus sequel Alien: Covenant, which will start a new trilogy of Alien prequels, it has been expected for a while that the female lead will also become the new “franchise lead” as well. So, it was something of a big deal for many young actresses working today, no doubt. This week, we learned that this sought after role has gone to Katherine Waterston, who is probably best known for costarring with Joaquin Phoenix in Inherent Vice. (Katherine Waterston also happens to be the daughter of Sam Waterston, of Law &amp; Order fame.) Michael Fassbender is also returning as the android David in Alien: Covenant, which will be directed by Ridley Scott, in what will be his third film in the Alien franchise (after Alien and Prometheus). 20th Century Fox has scheduled Alien: Covenant for release on October 6, 2017.5.&nbsp;MAMA DIRECTOR TO CONJURE SPIRITS FOR DEBUNKER HARRY HOUDINIIf you know two things about Harry Houdini, it’s probably that he followed a) his career as an escape artist with b) a second career as a debunker of mystics who claimed to speak to the spirits of the dead.&nbsp; There are a number of competing movies about the life (or chapters in the life) of Harry Houdini, and this week, another one joined the fray.&nbsp; Mama director Andres Muscietti has signed to direct an adaptation of the non-fiction book The Witch of Lime Street: Seance, Seduction, and Houdini in the Spirit World, by David Jaher. As sometimes happens with books with lengthy subtitles, David Jaher also basically put the premise of this movie right there on the book’s title. More specifically, this film will be set in the 1920s and focus on Houdini’s efforts to debunk a spirit medium known as “Crandon.”6.&nbsp;SPIDER-MAN SCREENWRITER UNWRAPS BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN REMAKEWe recently heard about how Universal Pictures is hoping to recruit Angelina Jolie to star in their remake of Bride of Frankenstein (the rumor/story goes, that’s partly how her film By the Sea got its greenlight). This film is, along with the new female-centric version of The Mummy (3/24/17) (starring Sofia Boutella from Kingsman: The Secret Service), part of Universal’s upcoming “Classic Monster Cinematic Universe.” Even though Universal is talking to Jolie about this contemporary new film, what they don’t have right now is a script. And that’s when we mention that screenwriter David Koepp has signed on to write Universal’s remake of Bride of Frankenstein.&nbsp;David Koepp‘s credits include&nbsp;Spider-Man (the first, really good one), David Fincher’s Panic Room, Steven Spielberg’s War of the Worlds, and the two latest Hanks/Howard films, Angels &amp; Demons and the upcoming Inferno.&nbsp; (David Koepp also wrote Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but his Tomatometer is still mostly Certified Fresh.)Rotten Ideas of The Week3. CHADWICK BOSEMAN APPOINTED TO PLAY JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALLAlthough Chadwick Boseman has only starred in five movies to date, already two of his biggest roles have been in celebrity biopics, as Jackie Robinson in 42 and as James Brown in Get On Up.&nbsp; Lately, the press about Boseman has been about either his casting as Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War and his own solo film. Add to those movies Chadwick Boseman’s upcoming portrayal of the god Thoth in Gods of Egypt, and his filmography is almost entirely made up of figures famous outside the movies (both real and fictional). Well, this week, yet another famous figure was added to that list, as Chadwick Boseman has signed to star as Thurgood Marshall in the historical film Marshall. Thurgood Marshall was of course, the first African American Supreme Court Justice, but Marshall will focus on a case much earlier in his career, when he represented a “black chauffeur against his wealthy socialite employer in a sexual assault and attempted murder trial that quickly became tabloid fodder.”&nbsp; Marshall will be directed by Reginald Hudlin (The Ladies Man, Boomerang, House Party), whose string of four Rotten Tomatometer ratings in a row is why this is one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas.”2.&nbsp;FIFTY SHADES OF GREY DIRECTOR TO TACKLE TED KENNEDY AND CHAPPAQUIDDICKIf you’re under a certain age, it’s very possible the word Chappaquiddick means absolutely nothing to you. It probably looks like a character’s name from Duck Tales or something. For older folks (or those who have boned up on their political history), Chappaquiddick possibly has a lot of meaning indeed. On July 18, 1969, Senator Edward “Ted” Kennedy accidentally drove his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, MA, killing his female passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Ted Kennedy was the last surviving Kennedy brother, and had until that point been seen as a likely president candidate for the 1972 election against Richard M. Nixon. (The news about the accident also broke the day before the historic Apollo 11 moon walk mission launched.) There has never been a major Hollywood movie about the Chappaquiddick scandal, but that’s about to change. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Fifty Shades of Grey, Nowhere Boy) is now in talks to direct a movie simply titled Chappaquiddick. The script, which was written by newcomers Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan, recently landed a spot on this year’s Black List of Unproduced Screenplays (see above).&nbsp;Chappaquiddick is described as a “political thriller” which details the events of seven days of Senator Kennedy’s life before (presumably) and after the accident that took Mary Jo Kopechne’s life. We’re calling this story a borderline “Rotten Idea” just because Sam Taylor-Johnson’s Tomatometer currently has two movies below 26%, and only one Fresh rating.1.&nbsp;VIN DIESEL TO CONTINUE RIDDICK SERIES WITH FURIA ORIGIN STORYBeing the star (or at least, one of two stars) of one of the biggest movie franchises of all time has its privileges. For Vin Diesel, we’re talking about how he has helped Universal Pictures make the Fast and Furious franchise what it is.&nbsp; And one of his rewards has been the ability to keep the Riddick science fiction series going, despite none of the films ever being box office smashes in their own right. Critically, the Riddick movies have never been beloved either, with their Tomatometer scores being 57% (Pitch Black), 29% (The Chronicles of Riddick), and 58% (2013’s Riddick). We know that the Riddick franchise is being kept alive because Vin Diesel took to his Facebook account this week&nbsp;to announce two new projects. The first is an upcoming TV series called Merc (basically a Riddick spinoff), and the second is an origin story for Diesel’s Riddick character called Furia (which might be expanded to something like The Chronicles of Riddick: Furia). Vin Diesel’s plan is to film the Furia origin story movie in early 2017, which suggests a release date probably in 2018. We’re calling this the “Rotten Story of the Week” because Vin Diesel is critically batting 0 and 3 with the Riddick franchise.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"cinematic, Film, FOX","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/18134437/GIJoeUniverse.jpg","slug":"hasbro-announces-cinematic-universe-centered-on-g-i-joe-plus-more-holllywood-headlines"},{"id":"47509191880092","title":"Mark Wahlberg Will Attend Lebron James’ Basketball Camp in Ballers, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Mark Wahlberg Will Attend Lebron James' Basketball Camp in Ballers, and More Movie NewsJared Leto will play Andy Warhol, Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, Rooney Mara and Sia team up, and Bill Hader joins Power Rangers.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 23, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Mission: Impossible 6, Power Rangers, Robin Hood: Origins, and the biopic Warhol.This WEEK’S TOP STORYMARK WAHLBERG JOINS LEBRON JAMES’ BALLERSThe HBO sports dramedy series Ballers debuted in 2014, and this weekend, wraps up its second season, with a third already in the works. People who are familiar with that show, and that it’s about football, may not have been confused as this week’s movie news, but it’s at least something that Google searches still find perplexing. That’s because Ballers is also the title of a basketball comedy feature film that’s been in the works since 2013, with LeBron James attached as an NBA superstar. This week, during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Mark Wahlberg revealed that he is now attached to also star alongside LeBron James in Ballers.&nbsp; Previously, Kevin Hart had also been attached to Ballers as Lebron’s&nbsp;less-talented-at-basketball brother, but Hart has since dropped out. Wahlberg will play one of a group of guys who go to a “basketball fantasy camp,” and while there, his and LeBron James’ character “have a situation” (quoting Wahlberg on The Tonight Show). Wahlberg is also bringing with him writer and TV producer Doug Ellin, the showrunner on Entourage (which Wahlberg also produced), to work on the screenplay previously cowritten by Kevin Hart. LeBron James made his acting debut in last summer’s comedy hit Trainwreck, and he is also attached to star in the reboot/sequel Space Jam 2.Fresh Developments1. IN THE FUTURE, EVERY JARED LETO WILL BE ANDY WARHOL FOR 15+ MINUTESNext year (specifically February 22, 2017) will mark the 30th anniversary of the death of 20th century “pop art” icon Andy Warhol, who died soon after normally non-lethal gallbladder surgery. Famous painters are very much a go-to staple in the biopic genre; contemporary examples who have already received their own films include Jackson Pollock, Jean-Michel Basquiat,&nbsp;and Margaret Keane (Big Eyes). Andy Warhol himself has been used a few times to add flavor to other films (such as 54, The Doors, Factory Girl, and I Shot Andy Warhol), but thus far, he&nbsp;hasn’t been the focus of a major film devoted just to him. That will change soon, because Jared Leto is now producing and attached to star in an Andy Warhol biopic titled simply Warhol. There have been dozens of books devoted to Warhol and his peripheral circle and influence, but this film will specifically be based upon Victor Bockris’ 1989 book Warhol: The Biography. Terence Winter, best known as the showrunner of HBO’s Boardwalk Empire (and for writing 19 episodes of The Sopranos) is now working on adapting Bockris’ biography. Winter will have many elements to draw upon, as Andy Warhol’s claims to fame include not just his famous use of pop culture and common objects in his art, but also his time as a magazine publisher (Interview), his musical associations (The Velvet Underground), his work in art films (such as Andy Warhol’s Frankenstein), the Factory and its influence on younger artists, and Warhol’s celebrity status in New York City. And of course (and there is no way this biopic doesn’t address this), Andy Warhol was also one of the most openly gay American celebrities, even before the events at Stonewall and the changes that came in the 1970s and 1980s.&nbsp;Warhol is being produced by former New Line Cinema executive Michael De Luca, whose credits as producer include Captain Phillips, Moneyball, and The Social Network.2. TOM CRUISE TO RETURN FOR MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 6 AFTER ALLThe funny thing about “the news” is that an initial news item often gets way, way more coverage than later follow-ups to the same story. Unfortunately, there is also an inherent drive for most sources to be the first to cover a story, which means that it’s difficult to check all factors and get the story absolutely 100% correct the first time out. Sometimes (actually frequently), film development news is just not that easy, since so much rests on scheduling, contracts, conflicting interests, etc. With all that said, a big story that emerged early last month was the news that Paramount was halting pre-production on Mission: Impossible 6 over contract negotiations with Tom Cruise.&nbsp; The angle that received the most attention was the notion that Cruise made more money on Universal Pictures’ reboot of The Mummy (producer fees were also an issue).&nbsp; Well, in what was relatively under-reported this week, Tom Cruise is indeed now signed (or close to signing) to return for Mission: Impossible 6. Production on the spy franchise sequel is expected to start by early 2017 to get the film ready for a release tentatively in the summer of 2018. As of right now, there are no known details about the premise of the sixth film, but generally, the Mission: Impossible franchise is not one that we usually know much about nearly two years before release.3.&nbsp;ROONEY MARA AND SIA JOIN FORCES FOR POP STAR MUSICAL VOX LUXFemale pop singers have been making the transition to the big screen for decades (just like their male counterparts); some examples include Diana Ross (Lady Sings the Blues), Madonna (Desperately Seeking Susan), and Mariah Carey (Glitter). More recently, we’ve heard news about films for the likes of Lady Gaga (opposite Bradley Cooper in A Star is Born), Rihanna (Ocean’s Eight), and Sia (as one of the voices in next year’s My Little Pony: The Movie). This week, we have another film credit for Sia, and just like her career as a pop singer, it will be another example where we won’t see her face. Rooney Mara is attached to play&nbsp;a pop star in the independent musical&nbsp;Vox Lux, with Sia providing the music via her own voice and a new batch of original songs.&nbsp;Vox Lux will be directed by independent director Brady Corbet (The Childhood of a Leader), who plans to film it in 65mm for exhibition in 70mm large format (ala Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight).&nbsp;The story of Vox Lux will follow a pop star named Celeste as she rises “from the ashes of a major national tragedy to pop superstardom. This 15-year odyssey, set between 1999 and the present day, tracks the important cultural evolutions of the 21st Century via her gaze” (thanks, Variety!). That’s what Rooney Mara has going on. As for her sister Kate, she’s preparing to film the independent romantic drama Mercy in Cincinatti, with Ellen Page already cast as her romantic interest.4. JAKE GYLLENHAAL TO STAR IN PAUL DANO’S DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WILDLIFEActor Paul Dano (There Will Be Blood) remains mostly an indie darling, with last year’s Beach Boys biopic Love &amp; Mercy being followed this summer by the bizarre Swiss Army Man (with Daniel Radcliffe). Like many actors, Paul Dano is now preparing to step behind the camera for his directorial debut, a marriage drama called Wildlife, based upon a novel by Richard Ford. The story is told from a boy’s perspective of his parents’ failing marriage, and this week, we learned that the two adult leads will be&nbsp;Jake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan (Inside Llewyn Davis, Drive). Jake Gyllenhaal’s next film Nocturnal Animals recently debuted in the festival circuit, and is scheduled for release this fall (11/28/16), and currently has a 88 percent Fresh Tomatometer score.5. STEPHEN KING’S HEARTS IN ATLANTIS TO BE ADAPTED AS (JUST) HEARTSIn addition to his dozens of novels (and hundreds of short stories), many of which have inspired film adaptations, Stephen King also periodically publishes novellas as well. These stories are typically in the 100-200 page range, and they are released in compilations like Different Seasons, Four Past Midnight, and Hearts in Atlantis. These books actually have given us some of King’s most famous movies, with Different Seasons alone providing the source material for Apt Pupil, Stand By Me (adapting The Body), and The Shawshank Redemption (adapting Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption). Something odd, however, happened with the 1999 collection Hearts in Atlantis, when it came time for Anthony Hopkins to star in the movie. Instead of adapting the story called “Hearts in Atlantis,” that movie adapted two other stories in the same book, leaving the titular tale unadapted. Well, that is an oversight that will soon be corrected, with the news that British director Johannes Roberts is now preparing an adaptation to be called Hearts (since Hearts in Atlantis is now already taken). Like King’s novella, Hearts will depict a group of college students in 1966 who play the card game Hearts and struggle with the possibility that they might be drafted if their studies suffer, and they have to leave college. No announcements have been made about possible casting for the college students.6.&nbsp;FIFTY SHADES OF WILL SCARLET: JAMIE DORNAN JOINS ROBIN HOOD: ORIGINSEver since Marvel’s The Avengers (and related films) popularized the notion of the “cinematic universe”, other studios have been developing their own takes on similarly interconnected films (such as Universal’s rebooting of their monster movies starting with The Mummy). One such concept that has made the news the last few years is the notion of Lionsgate developing a series of swashbuckling adventures focusing on the “Merry Men,” starting with Robin Hood: Origins. Three of the characters most frequently given as examples of spinning off from Robin Hood: Origins are Friar Tuck, Little John, and Will Scarlet. Thus far, three of the major characters have been cast: Robin Hood (Taron Egerton of Kingsman: The Secret Service), Maid Marian (Eve Hewson), and Little John (Jamie Foxx). As of this week, we now know that the potential star of the Will Scarlet spinoff movie is Jamie Dornan (Fifty Shades of Grey), who is now in talks for the role’s first appearance in Robin Hood: Origins. The first Robin Hood: Origins film will be directed for Lionsgate by Otto Bathurst (Peaky Blinders).7.&nbsp;DEADPOOL BAD GUY ED SKREIN CAST AS BAD GUY IN ALITA: BATTLE ANGELActor Ed Skrein does not yet have a “household name,” but thanks to his nasty role in Deadpool earlier this year, he’s getting closer to having, at least, a “household face.” Playing a villain for 20th Century Fox seemed to work out alright for Skrein in Deadpool, so perhaps that’s the reasoning behind his latest role. 20th Century Fox and producer James Cameron are in talks with Ed Skrein to join the manga adaptation Alita: Battle Angel as one of the film’s villains (possibly a cyborg, but that’s not confirmed yet).&nbsp;Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Machete, Spy Kids) took over the directing duties from James Cameron (so he could focus on the multiple Avatar sequels). If he signs on, Skrein will be joining a cast which includes Jackie Earle Haley, Christoph Waltz, and title star Rosa Salazar, whose Alita character is a “a 26th century cyborg who’s rescued from a scrapyard and reassembled…&nbsp; as a hunter-warrior who tracks down vicious criminals.” 20th Century Fox has scheduled Alita: Battle Angel for release on July 20, 2018 (the week after The Secret Life of Pets 2, and the week before Aquaman).2.&nbsp;BILL HADER TO VOICE ROBOT ALPHA 5 IN NEXT YEAR’S POWER RANGERSWe’re now just about six months away from the release of the Power Rangers reboot (March 24, 2017), and we’re still hearing new casting announcements. In this week’s case, it’s mostly because the character that is being cast is a possibly CGI animated supporting character. We’re talking here about the robot Alpha 5, who we now know will be voiced in the new movie by Saturday Night Live alum Bill Hader. The five stars are mostly “near unknowns,” but Bill Hader joins a few other “names” who ostensibly help give Power Rangers the star clout their leads don’t have yet. The other famous costars of Power Rangers&nbsp;are Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Malcolm in the Middle) as Zordon and Elizabeth Banks as the evil villainess Rita Repulsa. In other Power Rangers news, Lionsgate also revealed the first glimpses of the “Dinozords” this week via five preview posters. Although we typically call stories about Power Rangers “rotten ideas,” the addition of Bill Hader might now be tipping this movie into at least a “borderline” Fresh/Rotten status.ROTTEN IDEA&nbsp;OF THE WEEK1.&nbsp;PARAMOUNT WRITES OFF $115 MILLION FOR A MYSTERY MOVIE (THAT IS PROBABLY MONSTER TRUCKS)Within film journalism and online discussion, there is a whole sub-community devoted to box office and its ramifications on the film industry, both domestically and internationally. What is far less common is a story that unfolds about a film nearly four months before it’s even first released. That, however, is what apparently happened this week as various sources broke the news that Paramount Pictures is taking a write-down (ie, a “programming impairment charge”) of some $115 million on what is officially called an unknown title, but which pretty much every source says is this January’s family adventure Monster Trucks. That aliens-disguised-as-engines sci-fi comedy was originally first scheduled for release on May 29, 2015, until eventually being scheduled in the “dump month” of January, 2017. When it’s released on January 13, 2017, Monster Trucks will be going up against the awards-friendly wide releases of both Hidden Figures and Ben Affleck’s Live by Nights, as well as the (also pushed back) horror film The Bye Bye Man. The budget of Monster Trucks is reportedly in the range of $100 million, and the other $15 million probably comes from budgeted marketing costs, all of which Paramount is apparently expecting will add up to (or subtract down to) a loss higher than the budgets of many of its competitors in January, 2017.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"movies, One, love, Mary, GoT, razzies, movies, Star","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/23154112/Lebron-Wahlberg-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"mark-wahlberg-will-attend-lebron-james-basketball-camp-in-ballers-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509219204779","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Harrison Ford to Play Wyatt Earp in Black Hats","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Harrison Ford to Play Wyatt Earp in Black HatsPlus, new movies for Kevin Bacon and John Cusack, and Rob Cohen does history.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 29, 2011 |  CommentsFollowing San Diego Comic-Con last weekend, movie news slowed to a trickle this week, mostly consisting of last minute news from the convention, and a few other stories. What news did happen this week includes new movies for Kevin Bacon, Nicolas Cage, John Cusack and Harrison Ford, a sequel to Wolf Creek, an adaptation of The Nutcracker, and two very different cowboy movies.This Week’s Top StoryCOWBOYS &amp; ALIENS STAR HARRISON FORD TO PLAY OLD MAN WYATT EARP IN BLACK HATSCowboys &amp; Aliens opens in theaters this weekend, but Harrison Ford isn’t quite done playing aging cowboys just yet. The actor who gave the world both Han Solo and Indiana Jones has signed on to star as the aging Wyatt Earp in Black Hats, an adaptation of the novel by Max Allan Collins (Road to Perdition). Blending real historical figures with fiction, Black Hats tells the story of how 1920s Hollywood detective and movie consultant Wyatt Earp teams up with Bat Masterson to take on Al Capone in New York City when he learns that Doc Holliday’s son has gotten into trouble with the mobster. So, basically, to follow up Cowboys &amp; Aliens, Harrison Ford just signed on to a movie that could be called Cowboys &amp; Mobsters. Black Hats is being adapted by screenwriter Kurt Johnstad, who cowrote 300, and is now also adapting that film’s sequel 300: Battle of Artemisia. There’s no word yet on when Black Hats will start filming, or who will be directing. Harrison Ford is likely to be just the first big star to sign on for the film, as the roles of Bat Masterson and Al Capone also seem to be ripe for big name movie stars to portray.Fresh Developments This Week#1 ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING TRUE STORIES OF 2010 TO BECOME A MOVIE IN 2013Producer Mike Medavoy (Zodiac, Black Swan, Shutter Island) has signed an agreement with two Chilean businessmen to develop a feature film based upon the true story of the 33 miners trapped in the Copiapó copper/gold mine in 2010. Following a cave in, the 33 miners and support personnel were trapped half a mile underground for a record 69 days before eventually being rescued. Screenwriter Jose Rivera (The Motorcycle Diaries, Trade) will adapt the miners’ stories. An official book is being written by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Hector Tobar, and since this film is also being called “official,” some of the same material may also be used in the adaptation. Filming of this currently untitled project is expected to start sometime in 2012. It is not yet known whether this movie will be filmed in Spanish or English.#2 GERARD WAY’S THE UMBRELLA ACADEMY IS THE LATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE PROJECTIn 2008, Gerard Way, the leader singer of My Chemical Romance, got into the comic book business with The Umbrella Academy, a six issue limited series about a group of kid superheroes who reunite years later after their adoptive father dies. Now, Rawson Thurber (Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story) has signed on to do a rewrite of The Umbrella Academy, and possibly direct. The first draft was by Mark Bomback (Unstoppable; cowriter of Live Free and Die Hard), who also cowrote Bryan Singer’s upcoming Jack the Giant Killer. To give you an idea of what kind of movie The Umbrella Academy could be, when they were kids, the heroes defeated the Eiffel Tower after it was turned by a zombie robot into a giant monster that shot lasers. That was just one of two news stories involving Rawson Thurber this week. Thurber also has come aboard to direct We’re the Millers, a drug comedy to star Jason Bateman (Arrested Development, Horrible Bosses) as a low level drug dealer who concocts a plan to smuggle 1,400 pounds of marijuana using a rented RV and a fake family as a cover story.#3 JOAN ALLEN AND ALBERT FINNEY CONNECT THE BOURNE LEGACY TO THE MATT DAMON MOVIESAlthough Matt Damon won’t be returning as Jason Bourne in The Bourne Legacy, this week, two actors from The Bourne Ultimatum signed on to reprise their roles. Joan Allen costarred as CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy in The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, while Albert Finney played Dr. Albert Hirsch, the man in charge of the Treadstone behavior modification program, in The Bourne Ultimatum. Jeremy Renner will be playing one of the other assassins that was trained by Treadwell, Rachel Weisz will be costarring as the new agent’s romantic interest, and Oscar Issacs is also signed in an unknown role. Edward Norton is still in talks to play the film’s primary villain/antagonist. Director Tony Gilroy (Duplicity, Michael Clayton), who also wrote or cowrote the first three films, will be directing The Bourne Legacy, as well as cowriting with his brother Dan Gilroy (Two for the Money; cowriter of The Fall). Universal Pictures has already scheduled The Bourne Legacy for release on August 3, 2012.#4 KEVIN BACON RETURNS TO EVIL IN R.I.P.D.Kevin Bacon earned critical praise as Sebastian Shaw, the central villain in this summer’s X-Men: First Class. Now, the actor has signed on for another villainous role in Universal Pictures’ adaptation of the Dark Horse Comics series R.I.P.D. Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges are already signed to star as a rookie/veteran buddy cop team who work for an agency of deceased lawmen who fight supernatural criminals and monsters. R.I.P.D. will be directed by Robert Schwentke (Red, Flightplan) from a script by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, the screenwriting team behind Aeon Flux and Crazy/Beautiful (they also cowrote Clash of the Titans). Universal Pictures has already scheduled R.I.P.D. for the pre-Independence Day weekend of June 28, 2013. Kevin Bacon playing another villain, as well as the idea of Jeff Bridges playing an undead cowboy lawman are both “Fresh” ideas, but the rest of the creative people involved with R.I.P.D. lands it in the borderline area.Rotten Ideas of the Week#5 NICOLAS CAGE AND JOHN CUSACK STUCK TO THE FROZEN GROUNDJohn Cusack and Nicolas Cage are in talks to star in The Frozen Ground, a crime drama based upon the true story of Alaska serial killer Robert Hansen. John Cusack would play Hansen, who abducted over 20 women over a 12 year period, flying them into the Alaskan wilderness to be hunted and eventually killed. Nicolas Cage is in talks to play the Alaskan State Trooper who finds Hansen’s only surviving victim, who teams up with the young girl to bring Hansen to justice. The Frozen Ground will be produced by the independent company Emmett/Furla (16 Blocks, 88 Minutes, Righteous Kill). Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson is also one of the film’s executive producers. The Frozen Ground was adapted by newcomer screenwriter Scott Walker, who will also make his debut as director when filming starts this fall in Anchorage, Alaska.#4 THIS WEEK IN FAIRY TALE ADAPTATIONS: THE NUTCRACKERUniversal Pictures has picked up rights to a pitch based upon the 1816 German story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King by E.T.A. Hoffman, which went on to inspire the Tchaikovsky ballet The Nutcracker. This new movie based on The Nutcracker will be a live action adventure about a 12 year old girl who receives a Nutcracker doll as a gift. That leads to “an adventure that includes a war involving a seven-headed Mouse King and his army of mice, curses and themes of ugliness and beauty.” The pitch was made by the screenwriting team of Jon Gunn and Jon Mann, whose only previous credit is the 2000 Eric Roberts film Mercy Streets. Universal’s The Nutcracker is actually now the second movie in development based on that story, with the other being developed by the producers of The Twilight Saga.#3 THE GNOMEO &amp; JULIET TEAM REUNITES FOR COWBOY FANTASYElton John’s Rocket Pictures is reuniting with Gnomeo &amp; Juliet writer/director Kelly Asbury for an adaptation of Derek Keilty’s Will Gallows and the Snake Bellied Troll, the first in a series of British children’s books. Set in a world that combines fantasy with the Wild West, Will Gallows and the Snake Bellied Troll is the story of “a young Elfing sky cowboy” who sets out to bring Noose Womworx the troll to justice for the murder of his father, the former deputy sheriff of Oretown. Like Gnomeo &amp; Juliet, Will Gallows and the Snake Bellied Troll is expected to heavily feature musical elements. Unlike that film, however, it will feature both live action (probably Will Gallows) and CGI (probably the Snake Bellied Troll).#2 MORE CRAZY AUSSIE TORTURING IN WOLF CREEK 2Australian horror director Greg McLean (Rogue, Wolf Creek) has received the financing he needs to move ahead with plans for a sequel to the 2005 torture/captivity movie Wolf Creek. The premise for the sequel sounds nearly identical to the first film, as three backpackers in the Australian Outback encounter an evil torturer (John Jarratt reprising the role), who chases and then tortures and kills them. Wolf Creek 2 is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because the first film received a Rotten Tomatometer score (53%), but also because the whole “torture horror” genre seems over played at this point.#1 ACTION DIRECTOR ENLISTS FOR KOREAN WAR EPIC 1950Action director Rob Cohen (xXx, The Fast and Furious, Stealth) has signed on to direct a $100 million Korean War epic called 1950 (the year the war started). 1950 will be the most expensive film ever produced by the Korean film industry, and is scheduled to start filming in May of 2012 for a release in the spring of 2013. 1950 will be based on true stories of the Korean War as depicted by New York Herald Tribune journalist Marguerite Higgins, for which she became the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize. The producers are in talks with unspecified “A-list Hollywood and Asian talents” for the lead roles of Marguerite Higgins, Captain Darren, the leader of a platoon of Marines, and a Korean KATUSA named Sunjae Lee. KATUSA stands for Korean Augmentation to the United States Army, and refers to Korean soldiers who fight alongside American soldiers. General Douglas MacArthur is also expected to be depicted in 1950 as a supporting cast member. The script is being adapted by screenwriters Rachel Long and Brian Pittman, whose first produced credit will be the upcoming independent film Silver Falls. 1950 is the week’s most Rotten Idea mostly because Rob Cohen’s reputation as an over-the-top action director makes the concept of him directing a Korean War epic seem a bit too much like Michael Bay’s Pearl Harbor.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Access, Critics, star, blockbuster, Talk, Sundance, camera, composers, History, Biopics, Valentine's, Awards, BBC, CW, criterion","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Harrison-Ford-to-Play-Wyatt-Earp-in-Black-Hats"},{"id":"47509217689243","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Martin Scorsese Will Do A Serial Killer Film","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Martin Scorsese Will Do A Serial Killer FilmPlus, new roles for Anthony Hopkins, The Rock, and Chris Evans.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 23, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup doesn’t even really cover a full week, as it is being published on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving Thursday, and so only half a week has transpired since the last Ketchup. And Hollywood has basically taken the whole week off for the holiday as well, so instead of the usual 10 stories, this Ketchup can only give you seven… because that is literally everything that happened this week in movie news. Included in the mix are two different adaptations of Scandinavian novels, new movies for director Martin Scorsese and Kenneth Branagh, and new roles for Dame Judi Dench, Chris Evans, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.This Week’s Top StoryMARTIN SCORSESE TO GO DARK AGAIN POST-HUGO WITH THE SNOWMANThis week saw the release of director Martin Scorsese’s first ever “kids’ movie” Hugo. Possibly to address movie fans concerned that Hugo might be a sign that Scorsese has gone soft, it was announced this week that he was signed to direct an adaptation of the Norwegian serial killer novel The Snowman. This international bestseller was the seventh in the Harry Hole detective series by Norwegian author Jo Nesbø. The Snowman follows the investigation by Harry Hole, “an anti-authortarian, anti-sobriety cop,” of a series of killings targetting married women with children, and in each case, a snowman is found at the scene of the crime. Jo Nesbø had to agree to the production’s director selection, but also agreed to allow the English translation film not necessarily to be filmed in Oslo (where the novel is set). Screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan (The Kingdom, Lions for Lambs), who also cowrote the upcoming zombie disaster movie World War Z, is now working on adapting the screenplay from the novel. Despite being the center of news this week, The Snowman is not likely, however, to be Martin Scorsese’s first post-Hugo movie. Other previously announced projects for Scorsese include the missionaries-in-Japan drama Silence, the mobster biopic The Irishman (starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro), a Frank Sinatra biopic, and a possible remake of Scorsese’s Taxi Driver done in the style of Lars von Trier’s The Five Obstructions.Fresh Developments This Week#1 ANTHONY HOPKINS AND JUDI DENCH TO DON ITALIAN SHOES FOR KENNETH BRANAGHSir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Judi Dench are in negotations to star in the next film from director Kenneth Branagh (Thor, Hamlet, Henry V) (no “Sir” title for him… yet). Italian Shoes is an English language adaptation of a novel by Swedish author Henning Mankell. The story concerns an elderly man (Hopkins) who has spent years in isolation in the wilderness (where he lowers himself into the icy waters nearby each morning to remind himself that he’s still alive) whose life changes when an unexpected visitor (Dench) arrives. The Italian Shoes script was adapted by Richard Cottan, who also wrote several episodes of the Wallander TV series in which Kenneth Branagh also starred. Filming of Italian Shoes is expected to start in late 2012 or early 2013.#2 THE LATEST HAROLD &amp; KUMAR DIRECTOR SIGNS ON FOR SLASHER COMEDY FINAL GIRLSDirector Todd Strauss-Schulson recently made his studio debut with New Line Cinema’s A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas after a career previously best known for independent comedy shorts and videos. That movie ended up earning a Fresh RT score of 72% and $28 million at the box office thus far. Despite that low box office, but perhaps because of the good critical reception, New Line Cinema has signed Schauss-Schulson for another comedy project. In what is being called a cross between Back to the Future and Friday the 13th, Final Girls is a horror/comedy hybrid about a teenage girl who gets sucked with her friends into the 1980s slasher movie that her mother starred in. Final Girls was written by newcomers Mark Fortin and Josh Miller, who have worked on other projects, but have not yet had anything produced.#3 DWAYNE “THE ROCK” JOHNSON, MONSTER HUNTERA common point of complaint among action movie fans concerns the way that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has spent much of his post-WWE movie career starring in family-friendly fare like Tooth Fairy and Race to Witch Mountain. The argument is often made that Johnson is an obvious natural for more adult-friendly action movies (and as with all things, there’s a ticking clock about how much longer the 39-year-old will be able to stay in top shape). Recently, Dwayne Johnson has started to transition back into non-kids-movies with Fast Five, but his next two movies are Journey 2: The Mysterious Island and G.I. Joe: Retaliation, which are both arguably hybrid movies in terms of this argument. This week, Dwayne Johnson signed on to star in an adaptation of the independent comic book miniseries Monster Hunter’s Survival Guide for Simon Kinberg, producer of X-Men: First Class and the upcoming Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Neil Blomkamp’s Elysium. As the title suggests, Monster Hunter’s Survival Guide is “a comprehensive guide to hunt monsters [sic], the undead and unnatural beasts, and survive the confrontations.” There is not a director or even a screenwriter announced for the adaptation yet, so Monster Hunter’s Survival Guide can most likely be seen as a possible project for farther along in The Rock’s career.#4 THE HUMAN TORCH JOINS THE ICEMAN (BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MARVEL COMICS)The Iceman is the name of a long-in-development adaptation of the Phillip Carlo serial killer biography Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer, about Richard “The Iceman” Kuklinski. Kuklinski (who was 6′ 5″ and 300 pounds) claimed to be responsible for as many as 200 murders over the course of a 30 year career, and died in prison in 2006 at the age of 70. The independent production has had a rocky road through casting. Mickey Rourke was originally supposed to star as Kuklinski, but he has since been replaced by Michael Shannon (Revolutionary Road, Boardwalk Empire). Benicio Del Toro had been signed to play Kuklinski’s mob boss Roy Demeo, but Del Toro has since been replaced by Ray Liotta. Finally, James Franco had been attached to play Kuklinski’s hitman mentor, but Franco recently bailed on the project. And that brief history of the project brings us up to this week’s news, which is that Chris Evans (AKA Captain America and Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movies) has signed on to replace James Franco as Robert “Mr. Softee” Pronge. Independent director Ariel Vromen (2005’s RX, 2006’s Danika) is preparing to start filming The Iceman in December in Detroit, working from a script he cowrote with his RX screenwriter Morgan Land. Shannon, Liotta and Evans will be joined by a supporting cast which includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Elias Koteas and David Schwimmer.#5 WHAT SCARLETT JOHANSSON REALLY WANTS IS TO DIRECT… SUMMER CROSSINGScarlett Johansson has announced plans to follow the career arc of so many other actors and actresses before her: she’s going to become a director. Johansson’s choice for her first movie as director will be an adaptation of Summer Crossing, Truman Capote’s first novella, which was long thought to be lost until eventually being published in 2005. Finally, it should be noted that this story actually broke late last week, but this is already a short Ketchup this week, so it’s being included here to help fill out the piece a bit. Actress-turned-screenwriter Tristine Skyler (1999’s Getting to Know You), who also has an adaptation of Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar in development, adapted Capote’s novella. Set during the hot New York summer of 1945, Summer Crossing is the story of an 18-year-old debutante who decides not to join her parents on vacation in France, so that she can instead have a summer exploring her sexuality. There’s no word yet as to whether Johansson (currently 27) plans on also starring in Summer Crossing. Since there’s no way of really knowing whether or not Johansson has directing talent or not, this should be considered a borderline Fresh Development for now.Rotten Ideas of the Week#1 CHOPPING MALL GETTING A REMAKE THAT LEAVES OUT THE WHOLE PREMISE OF THE MOVIEFirst off, it should be noted that this pre-Thanksgiving shortened week was so light in news that not only was there only 7 stories (instead of 10, which are usually chosen from 15 to 40 total stories), but the Rotten Idea is for a movie that may not even be intended to get a theatrical release. However, there is something so inherently ridiculous about the premise of this remake that it has to be mentioned here. Kevin Bocarde, the producer of titles like Shark Swarm, Lightning Bug and The Curse of King Tut’s Tomb, is reuniting with FX-makeup-artist-turned-director Robert Hall, the director of Laid to Rest and Chromeskull: Laid to Rest 2 for a remake of the 1986 Roger Corman horror film Chopping Mall. Originally released as Killbots, Chopping Mall is about a group of teenagers who find themselves trapped in a shopping mall guarded by robotic security guards who start killing all of the teens. That premise is classic B movie cheese, but it’s not really what makes this a Rotten Idea (because really, who cares if Chopping Mall gets a remake?). No, the Rotten part is in how Robert Hall plans on remaking it. The new Chopping Mall will “downplay the science fiction elements and instead focus on a supernatural terror.” That’s right… a remake of a movie about killer robots is going to leave out the killer robots. Oy vey. Anyway… have a great Thanksgiving!For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"movies, screenings, elevated, Awards, movie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Martin-Scorsese-Will-Do-A-Serial-Killer-Film"},{"id":"47509202741758","title":"Weekly Ketchup: The Joker and Harley Quinn Confirmed for Suicide Squad","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: The Joker and Harley Quinn Confirmed for Suicide SquadPlus, new roles for Christoph Waltz, Robert De Niro, and Julia Roberts, as well as a Playmobil movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 14, 2014 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers seven days of movie development news for such movies as King Arthur, Playmobil, Wonder Woman, the next James Bond movie, and new roles for Robert De Niro, Dwayne Johnson, and Julia Roberts.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryVILLAINOUS SWEETHEARTS JOKER AND HARLEY QUINN IN SUICIDE SQUADThis was a big week for casting news for Warner Bros’ DC Comics adaptation Suicide Squad, with the last seven days seeing the release of three different casting stories for that movie about super villains brought together as a team. The first story of the week also involved the most famous character and the biggest star of the three. Jared Leto is being “eyed” to star as Batman’s archenemy The Joker in Suicide Squad for director David Ayer (Training Day, Fury, End of Watch). Directly related to that news is the report this week that Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street) has signed to costar as Harley Quinn, the Joker’s psychiatrist-turned-girlfriend. And finally, for a character that has nothing to do with either, there’s the assassin Deadshot, who might be played by Jai Courtney (Divergent, A Good Day to Die Hard). Suicide Squad is expected to feature an ensemble cast of various super villains, with Tom Hardy and Will Smith also in talks for unknown roles (although they might be Rick Flag and Captain Boomerang). Jesse Eisenberg may also reprise his role as Lex Luthor from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which will be released on March 25, 2016 before Suicide Squad is released later that summer on August 5, 2016.Fresh Developments This Week#1 BREAKING BAD DIRECTOR IN TALKS FOR WONDER WOMANThere was a time when a way to write, in code, that a movie was a potential train wreck was to combine the phrase “feature film debut” with “previously has only directed television.” Well, as you may have heard, we are in a new golden age of television, and that math no longer necessarily adds up. Take, for example, the news this week that TV producer/director Michelle McCLaren is now in talks with Warner Bros to make her feature film debut with Wonder Woman. That’s one way to tell the story, but another would be to say that Michelle McClaren was the director of such recent hours of television as four episodes of Game of Thrones, three episodes of The Walking Dead (including the S2 episode where Rick “killed” [SPOILER]), and a whopping 11 episodes of Breaking Bad (including four from S5 with some of the most important plot beats). For her work on Breaking Bad, Michelle McClaren has been Emmy-nominated twice as director, and won two Emmys as producer. Instead, most of the press has focused on McClaren’s gender (if she signs on, McClaren will be the second female director of a major comic book adaptation, after Lexi Alexander on Punisher: War Zone). Gal Gadot will star as Wonder Woman when the solo movie is released on June 23, 2017, after first appearing as the character in 2016 in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.&nbsp;#2 WILL CHRISTOPH WALTZ BE A VILLAIN IN THE NEXT JAMES BOND FILM?Or just a totally awesome and nice guy who just happens to be German (that *would* be a twist)? The news comes from Daily Mail columnist Baz Bamigboye (names are just plain cooler in the U.K.), who attempted to get an answer as to the nature of Waltz’s character (bad guy? good guy? somewhere-in-between?), and the answers he seemed to get varied between each (unidentified) source. Whatever the nature of his character, Christoph Waltz joins a growing cast which already includes Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Lea Seydoux, Rory Kinnear, and Dave Bautista. Hopefully soon, we’ll get a title for “James Bond 24”, which will be directed by Sam Mendes, who made his Bond debut with Skyfall.&nbsp;#3 ROBERT DE NIRO IN TALKS TO PLAY J-LAW’S DAD IN JOYDirector David O. Russell has definitely established by now that he is believes in using a “production posse,” with Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, and Mark Wahlberg all having appeared in at least two of his films. If there’s one actress that most obviously represents this for Russell, it’s Jennifer Lawrence, who starred in his two most recent films (Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle), and who will be starring in his next film, Joy, based on the true story of Joy Mangano, creator of the Miracle Mop (yes, there’s really going to be a “Miracle Mop” movie). This week, another acclaimed actor started talks which will bump him up to working with David O. Russell three times (in a row), and it’s Robert De Niro. If De Niro signs the deal, he will be playing the father of Jennifer Lawrence’s character, who started inventing gadgets when she was a teenager, and eventually became a HSN star by appearing on the network to pitch her own products.&nbsp;#4 JUDE LAW TAKES VILLAIN ROLE IN GUY RITCHIE’S KING ARTHURWarner Bros and director Guy Ritchie are preparing for production on what has long been planned as the first of a six movie King Arthur epic, and this week, we found out who is in talks to play the villain in that film. Having said that, that’s about all we know about Jude Law’s character, including whether this particular villain will just be in the first movie, appear in several, or all six. Another detail also came with this news, which is that Idris Elba has dropped out of the franchise, with other actors now being considered for the “mentor” role, which had been described as “Merlin-esque” (an odd distinction when the character could just be called “Merlin”). If he signs on, Jude Law will join a cast which already includes Charlie Hunnam as Arthur and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Guinevere. This will also be the third time that Jude Law and Guy Ritchie have worked together, after their two Sherlock Holmes movies together.&nbsp;#5 JULIA ROBERTS TO REUNITE WITH GEORGE CLOONEY FOR MONEY MONSTERThis was a big week for actors reuniting after previously working together on other movies. Another example of that involved George Clooney, who previously worked with Julia Roberts on Ocean’s Eleven, Ocean’s Twelve, and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Roberts and Unbroken star Jack O’Connell are both now in talks to join George Clooney in the movie Money Monster, which will be directed by Jodie Foster (Little Man Tate, The Beaver). Money Monster will be a “financial thriller” about the star (George Clooney) of a financial advice TV show (also called Money Monster, produced by Roberts’ character) who is held hostage on the air by a blue collar worker (O’Connell) in an effort to increase a stock’s value and save his family’s finances. Jack O’Connell also made the Weekly Ketchup last week for signing to star in Terry Gilliam’s long-awaited Don Quixote.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 DWAYNE JOHNSON AND KEVIN HART JOIN ACTION COMEDY CENTRAL INTELLIGENCEThe success of the two Jump Street movies is reportedly leading other studios to start moving forward with their own comedies that revive the “buddy action comedy” subgenre. The latest example of this happening is New Line Cinema’s Central Intelligence, which is also a “class reunion” comedy about a high school athlete who is approached by a classmate who was bullied back in the day. The “twist” is that the former jock will be played by Kevin Hart, and the bullied kid is now an assassin for the CIA, as played by Dwayne Johnson. Central Intelligence will be directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, whose first film was well received (Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story), but whose second and third movies (The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and We’re the Millers) both have Rotten Tomatometer scores.&nbsp;#3 PLAYMOBIL TOYS TO GET THEIR OWN MOVIE, TOO (TAKE THAT, LEGO!)This writer doesn’t think that he ever gave it much thought, but apparently, within certain toy company circles, companies like LEGO and Playmobil are seen as direct competitors. Forced to consider it, there are similarities — one is Danish, one is German, and they both use little “people toys.” You can also often find both in highly used condition at garage sales and thrift stores. Anyway, presuming that the Playmobil people really see LEGO as their decades-long corporate competition, it’s easy to imagine lots of German exclamations (“Verdammt! Schweinhund! Fahrvergnügen!”) at the Playmobil board room as the box office figures came in each week earlier this year for The LEGO Movie. Even if that’s not true (regardless of how much fun this writer had imagining that scene), a Playmobil movie is still now in development. The $80 million animated feature will be a partnership between three French companies: Wild Bunch, Pathé, and ON Entertainment, which is also the animation house currently working on an adaptation of The Little Prince. The executive in charge of development on the Playmobil movie previously worked as head of story at DreamWorks on such movies as Shrek 2, Puss in Boots, and Monsters vs Aliens. Although the movie doesn’t currently have any sort of distribution in the USA, it’s being aimed at release in late 2017.&nbsp;#2 EDDIE MURPHY TO STAR AS COOK FOR DRIVING MISS DAISY DIRECTORWhen his publicist is promoting his new movies, director Bruce Beresford is almost always mentioned in the same sentence as Driving Miss Daisy, the movie that won the Best Picture Academy Award which did not go to Field of Dreams, My Left Foot, Dead Poets Society, or Born on the Fourth of July. Of Bruce Beresford’s last ten films as director, only 2002’s Evelyn has earned a Fresh Tomatometer score. For his next film, Bruce Beresford will be directing Cook, which has a premise that sounds a lot like Driving Miss Daisy. Eddie Murphy will be playing a cook hired by a dying man to work for his girlfriend and his daughter for a few months after his death, in a working relationship that ends up lasting for 15 years. The character of the daughter will be played by Britt Robertson, who will be seen next year as the star of Tomorrowland, along with George Clooney.&nbsp;#1 1001 ARABIAN NIGHTS TO GET GOTG-STYLE MOVIE FORTY THIEVESIt’s been going on since Garbo was gabby, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t remain worthy of notice: a very successful movie inspires imitators (people who say it’s flattering are probably the ones doing the flattering). 20th Century Fox is now developing a movie called Forty Thieves, which is described as “being in the vein of Guardians of the Galaxy and Pirates of the Caribbean,” but it’s more directly an adaptation of the folk tale “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves”, as commonly found in the collection of stories called One Thousand and One Nights (AKA Arabian Nights). Forty Thieves will be directed by Shawn Levy, whose filmography as director includes the three Night at the Museum movies, Real Steel, The Internship, and This is Where I Leave You. 20th Century Fox is currently meeting with various young actors (including Liam Hemsworth and Evan Peters) for the lead role of “Allen”, who is believed to be the Forty Thieves stand-in for the character of “Ali Baba.” Nothing much else is yet known about Forty Thieves, including the setting, but the name “Allen” sort of tells us that it’s probably not set in Medieval Arabia.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Character, Apple, King, NYCC, king, Emmy, Fox, E3, animated, mockumentary, scene, story","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-the-joker-and-harley-quinn-confirmed-for-suicide-squad"},{"id":"47509219197607","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman in Les Miserables","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman in Les MiserablesPlus, a new Scorsese film and casting updates for Josh Brolin, Anne Hathway, and Taylor Lautner.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 2, 2011 |  CommentsHollywood’s weekly news cycles have been very slow through most of August, and the buzz only got quieter this week before the Labor Day weekend. Things are so slow, that it was even difficult for this writer to figure out which story deserves to be the Top Story. There were only a total of 14 news stories (at all) to choose from for the week’s Top 10, which meant that a story had to be really obscure not to be included. This week’s hum drum announcements include new projects for Josh Brolin, Anne Hathaway, Ed Helms, Dwayne Johnson, Taylor Lautner, Zoe Saldana and director Martin Scorsese.This Week’s Top StoryANNE HATHAWAY AND HUGH JACKMAN TAKE THEIR MUSICAL ACT TO THE MOVIES: LES MISERABLESEver since their duet at the Oscars in 2009, there has been speculation about whether Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman will ever do a movie musical together. This week, that question was answered with the news that Anne Hathaway is set to join the cast of Les Miserables as Fantine, the doomed mother of Cosette. Les Miserables is of course an adaptation of the stage musical set during the French Revolution, based upon the novel by Victor Hugo. Director Tom Hooper (The King’s Speech, The Damned United) is lining up a star studded cast that is rumored to include Russell Crowe (replacing the earlier reported Paul Bettany) as Inspector Javert, and Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers. Geoffrey Rush previously played Javert in the 1998 film Les Miserables which also costarred Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman and Claire Danes. The casting of Cosette and Eponine is the next step, with Miranda Cosgrove (Nickelodeon’s iCarly), Lucy Hale (NBC’s Bionic Woman), Hayden Panettiere (NBC’s Heroes) and Emma Watson (Hermione of the Harry Potter films) being considered for either role. Filming of Les Miserables is expected to start in February, 2012 in England before Hugh Jackman proceeds to Canada for filming of The Wolverine. Les Miserables is a coproduction between Universal Pictures and Working Title Films.Fresh Developments This Week#1 MARTIN SCORSESE REMAKING A MOVIE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH KENNY ROGERSDirector Martin Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan (Body of Lies, Kingdom of Heaven) previously worked together on 2006’s The Departed. This week, both Scorsese and Monahan signed with Paramount Pictures to develop a remake of the 1974 James Caan addiction drama The Gambler, which was itself based upon a short novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The Gambler told the story of a college professor struggling with an addiction to gambling on basketball scores. That movie, by the way, should not be confused with the series of TV movies starring Kenny Rogers that started in 1980. Paramount hopes that frequent Scorsese collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio will star, but negotiations with DiCaprio haven’t yet started. This week, William Monahan was also revealed to be working with Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez on the script for Sin City 2.#2 SPIKE LEE HAS TRAPPED JOSH BROLIN IN HIS REMAKE OF OLDBOYJosh Brolin has signed with Mandate Pictures (Whip It, The Switch, Drag Me to Hell) to star in the English language remake of Park Chan-wook’s Korean action thriller Oldboy, which will be directed by Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X, Inside Man). Josh Brolin will play a man who is kidnapped and kept hostage for 15 years until he is finally released and sets out to take his revenge. The screenplay was adapted by Mark Protosevich, whose past work includes Poseidon and cowriting duties on I Am Legend. Back when Steven Spielberg was attached to direct this remake a few years ago, Will Smith was to have been the star.#3 SCOTT PILGRIM AND BRIDESMAIDS COSTARS STEP UP FOR PITCH PERFECT LEAD ROLESAnna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson are young actresses currently best known for supporting roles in Twilight, Up in the Air, Scott Pilgrim Vs the World, and Bridesmaids. Anna Kendrick was in those first three films, and Rebel Wilson played Kristen Wiig’s British roommate in the last. Kendrick and Wilson are now signed with Universal Pictures to costar in the romantic comedy Pitch Perfect, set in the world of college a capella singing groups. Kendrick will be playing a rebellious goth girl who surprisingly becomes the singing group’s secret weapon in competitions. Since Pitch Perfect is also described as a romantic comedy, she presumably falls in love with someone too. Director Jason Moore, who directed the stage musical Avenue Q as well as episodes of Dawson’s Creek, Everwood and Brothers &amp; Sisters, will be making his feature film debut with Pitch Perfect. Filming of Pitch Perfect is scheduled to start this fall in New Orleans.#4 ED HELMS TO STAR IN REMAKE OF FRENCH COMEDY LE MACEd Helms, one of the Wolf Pack stars from The Hangover, has signed to star in the English language remake of the 2010 French comedy Le Mac, which will presumably have a different title (The Mac, perhaps?). Jose Garcia starred in Le Mac in the dual roles of a banker and the criminal mastermind pimp who is secretly his long lost twin brother (who the banker must impersonate to help the police with a case). The adaptation is being written by newcomer screenwriter Johnny Rosenthal. This remake is being produced by Ben Stiller’s Red Hour Films production company, which most recently produced 30 Minutes or Less in addition to several of Stiller’s past films (Zoolander, Tropic Thunder, etc). This remake is a borderline Fresh Development mostly because not enough is yet known to really damn it with a Rotten Idea label.Rotten Ideas of the Week#5 ZOE SALDANA SAYS SOMEDAY, SOMEDAY, SOMEDAY… DOMINIONAvatar and Star Trek star Zoe Saldana marked the first week of release for her new action film Colombiana by signing with Paramount Pictures to star in a supernatural thriller called Dominion. Although the premise is mostly being kept secret for now, what is known is that Zoe Saldana will play a woman who is half human and half angel. Saldana will also produce Dominion, which is based on a spec pitch by newcomer screenwriters Dean McCreary and Chester Hastings, who cowrote the short film Fanboy featuring Sam Raimi and J.K. Simmons as themselves. Dominion is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because of its status as yet another movie about angels.#4 NEW SCREENWRITER SNIKTS HIS PENS INTO THE WOLVERINEThe filming schedule for The Wolverine has reportedly been pushed back until the spring of 2012 (after Hugh Jackman wraps filming of Les Miserables). This change now allows time for a rewrite of the original script by Christopher McQuarrie (Valkyrie, The Usual Suspects). The new screenwriter will be Mark Bomback, who previously wrote Unstoppable, cowrote Live Free or Die Hard and Race to Witch Mountain and also has the Total Recall remake coming soon. The new script is expected to still be set in Japan, and feature a supporting cast of mostly Japanese or Japanese American actors except for the character of Viper, who’s described as a secretary for Japan’s Minister of Justice. In the comics, Viper (AKA Madame Hydra) is a long running villain for the Avengers who also blackmailed Wolverine into marrying her. The Wolverine will be directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, Knight and Day) in 2012 with filming expected to be mostly done in Vancouver with some filming also in Tokyo. The Wolverine has been a Rotten Idea pretty much since Darren Aronofsky left the project, and the contributions from one of the Live Free or Die Hard writers does little to change that.#3 NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM DIRECTOR RESURRECTS FRANKENSTEIN FOR 20TH CENTURY FOXFollowing delays for the studio’s planned remake of Fantastic Voyage, 20th Century Fox has signed director Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum, Date Night, Real Steel) for their entry in Hollywood’s race to see who can get a new Frankenstein movie made first. Fox’s Frankenstein is being written by Max Landis (John Landis’ son), who has a few other projects in the works but has not yet had a feature film produced and released. Landis’ script is described as being a “sci fi take” on Mary Shelley’s novel which “focuses on themes of friendship and redemption.” The other Frankenstein projects that Fox’s version is competing with include Guillermo del Toro’s long gestating project at Universal, Sony’s contemporary version, adaptations of The Casebook of Victor Frankenstein, This Dark Endeavor: The Apprenticeship of Victor Frankenstein and Wake the Dead, starring Haley Joel Osment (which currently seems likely to be the first movie actually filmed and produced). This is one of the Rotten Ideas this week because Frankenstein and Night at the Museum really don’t belong in the same sentence together.#2 WILL SHARK BOY AND THE ROCK BE DAVID AND GOLIATH?The success and ongoing cult popularity of The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lava Girl and Twilight continue to buoy the career of Taylor Lautner. Taylor Lautner and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson are reportedly in negotiations to star in the ancient Hebrew war epic Goliath based upon the Biblical tale of the future King David (Lautner) and his struggles with the philistine warrior Goliath (Johnson). Director Scott Derrickson (The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) signed on earlier this year to helm Goliath, which is being produced by two of the people behind The Twilight Saga. Lautner stands at a height of 5′ 10″, which makes him seem tall in comparison to most of his costars, but Dwayne Johnson will appropriately tower over Lautner too at a height of 6′ 5″. Although Johnson might indeed make a pretty great Goliath, the idea of Shark Boy playing the young King David earns this story its Rotten Idea tag.#1 DIE HARD 5 WILL BE A SEQUEL DIRECTED BY A REMAKE SPECIALIST20th Century Fox continued to keep the 5th entry in the Die Hard franchise on the fast track this week with the hiring of the film’s director. Irish director John Moore has made all of his movies to date for the studio, with an emphasis on remakes (The Omen, Flight of the Phoenix) that also included the video game adaptation Max Payne. Die Hard 5 will mostly be filmed in Russia, with Fox hoping that it can be wrapped before Bruce Willis moves on to star in the planned sequel to last year’s Red. Die Hard 5 is described as a father-son action adventure, and was written by screenwriter Skip Woods, who wrote the video game adaptation Hitman, as well as Swordfish, and shared cowriting duties on The A-Team and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. John Moore’s RT Tomatometer record is what earns Die Hard 5 its Most Rotten Idea of the Week status, though the idea of that limping franchise getting a fifth movie was most likely enough by itself.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"2017, All, Amazon, drama, video","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Anne-Hathaway-and-Hugh-Jackman-in-Les-Miserables"},{"id":"47509238796122","title":"The Weekly Ketchup: New Bond Title, Golden Brad Bird, Del Toro To Direct Hobbits","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Weekly Ketchup: New Bond Title, Golden Brad Bird, Del Toro To Direct HobbitsAlso: Another role for Shia, new pic of Will Smith as Hancock.by Nick Hershey | February 1, 2008 |  CommentsIn this week’s Ketchup, Bond 22 has a flashy new title, Brad Bird gets his just desserts for directing the highest rated film of 2007, and Shia LaBeouf is set to star as the last man on Earth.

Candy Land?Plus new projects for Martin Scorsese and Terry Gilliamby Greg Dean Schmitz | February 6, 2009 |  CommentsThis week was chockful of so many movie announcements that the Weekly Ketchup could have been a top 20 instead of a top 10, but these jewels of the week include new movies for acclaimed directors Martin Scorsese and Terry Gilliam, sequels for Sex and the City and Bloodsport and a movie based on the Candy Land board game.#1 NEVER MIND GREEN HORNET, HERE COMES GREEN LANTERN!Coming off the upcoming Mel Gibson movie, Edge of Darkness, Martin Campbell (GoldenEye, Casino Royale) is in talks to direct Green Lantern, the outer space superhero project which Warner Bros is now tagging as their #1 priority among their various projects based on DC Comics characters (the western Jonah Hex is #2). The adventures of Green Lantern take place within a epic space opera scope comparable to Star Wars, as pilot Hal Jordan is entrusted with a power ring which allows him to form anything he can imagine out of an green power that is as strong as Jordan can keep his will resolute. The three screenwriters who are being credited as working on Green Lantern are Greg Berlanti (creator of TV’s Everwood), comics writer Marc Guggenheim (Aquaman, The Flash) and Michael Green, who like Guggenheim, has written various TV shows that Berlanti has produced. With Green Lantern given top priority, we should now hear some casting news for Hal Jordan, and the many other DC characters that this very positive script review suggests should be in the movie.#2 DANIEL DAY LEWIS AND MARTIN SCORSESE TO COLLABORATE A THIRD TIME ON SILENCEAlthough his latest film, Shutter Island (AKA Ashecliffe) won’t hit theaters until this October, director Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas) is already lining up his next project, which will be Silence, a project Scorsese has been eager to make for over a decade, long before he even acquired the rights to the Shusaku Endo novel in 2005. Adapted by Jay Cocks (De-Lovely; cowriter of Gangs of New York), Silence is the 17th century story of two Jesuit priests who encounter violence and prejudice when they travel to Japan to both locate their mentor and spread the word of Christianity. In various stages of negotation to star in Silence are Daniel Day-Lewis (who starred in Scorsese’s The Age of Innocence and Gangs of New York), Benicio Del Toro and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y Tu Mama Tambien), although it’s not yet known if the missing priest will be played by Day-Lewis or Del Toro. Filming of Silence is expected to start later this year in New Zealand.#3 SEX AND THE CITY 2: IS OBSESSIVE SHOE COLLECTING RECESSION PROOF?Sure, there’s no script yet, but that apparently isn’t going to stop Sex and the City 2 from getting fast-tracked and produced in time for a planned Summer, 2010 release date. The four stars (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall) made the news a few years back about whether they would migrate from HBO to a movie version (mostly Kim Cattrall), but this time around, their collective casting is the first real news for the sequel. Michael Patrick King, who wrote, directed and coproduced the $152 million dollar hit will be back to do the same for the sequel.#4 THE HANSON BROTHERS RETURN: SLAP SHOT REMAKEThe genre of hockey movies is very spotty, populated mostly by the Mighty Ducks franchise, the star-studded 1999 flop that was Mystery, Alaska, the unapologetic patriotism of The Miracle and the 1977 Paul Newman-starring gem, Slap Shot. Which of those do you think Universal wants to remake? Dean Parisot (Galaxy Quest, the Fun with Dick and Jane remake) has been signed to direct the Slap Shot remake from a script by Peter Steinfeld (Be Cool; cowriter of 21). Slap Shot is the story of the coach of a losing minor league team, the Charlestown Chiefs, who attempts to bring them victory by turning the team into a gang of violent thugs on the ice, led by the possibly insane trio of the Hanson Brothers. Something that’s interesting about that Variety article is that it makes note of the Internet furor over the idea of a Slap Shot remake, and points out the success of Adam Sandler’s remake of The Longest Yard, showing that the writer doesn’t get that people don’t have the same kind of affection for Burt Reynold’s The Longest Yard as they do for Slap Shot.#5 BLOODSPORT 2: BLOODIER, SPORTIERI’ve not yet seen JCVD, but the buzz is that it is evidence that Jean-Claude Van Damme totally gets his role in the world, and basically pops the balloon of anyone who will ever want to make a joke about him ever again. And so, I will give the Muscles from Brussels some respect and treat this story completely seriously. No zingers on this one! Talking to Total Film, Van Damme revealed that he has plans to make a “true sequel” to Bloodsport, the first movie he starred in. Let me just say right here that whatever I thought of JCVD’s later work, Bloodsport was indeed a very well done, kick ass martial arts movie. Van Damme’s plan is to ignore the three sequels that he didn’t star in, and tell the story of Frank Dux 20 years later (a la The Wrestler?), as “a complete bum, maybe abusing his son” and “on drugs.” JCVD is encountering some resistance to the concept, but I think it sounds really intriguing.#6 HASBRO MOVIES: TRANSFORMERS, G.I. JOE AND NOW, CANDY LAND?The first movie to come out of the deal between Universal and Hasbro to make movies based on their classic board games appears to be Candy Land, the game that Wikipedia says has “no optimal strategy, or indeed any decision making.” That sounds like a great game for someone who would greenlight a Candy Land movie. In Candy Land, players take on the role of a gingerbread man as he travels through locations like Chocolate Swamp and Candy Cane Forest, as they learn how to tell colors apart, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. Kevin Lima (Enchanted, A Goofy Movie) will direct from a script by Etan Cohen (Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa; cowriter of Tropic Thunder). Yes, one of the Tropic Thunder writers is scripting the Candy Land movie, though I’m not sure if that means someone at Universal has a brilliant sense of irony, or totally does not.#7 YOUNG DISNEY STARS TO STAR IN FOX’S BEEZUS AND RAMONAThe long-in-development movie version of Beverly Cleary’s popular series of novels aimed at young girls, Ramona, has had its focus changed slightly to adapt first Beezus and Ramona, which Cleary wrote in 1955 before the seven books in which Ramona is the main title character. In casting the movie, Fox 2000 has managed a coup of sorts, as both Selena Gomez (star of Wizards of Waverly Place) as Beatrice/Beezus and Joey King (supporting role in The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody) as Ramona are coming from shows on the popular Disney Channel. Beezus and Ramona is the story of how a girl named Beatrice (AKA Beezus) learns to deal with her annoying little sister, Ramona. Elizabeth Allen (Aquamarine) is directing from a script by Laurie Craig (the parrot comedy Paulie) and Nick Pustay (2007’s Camille). Filming starts later this spring, and 20th Century Fox has set a release date for Beezus and Ramona of March 19th, 2010.#8 TERRY GILLIAM RETURNING TO THE MEANING OF LIFE WITH ZERO THEOREMWe’re still waiting to see Heath Ledger’s last film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, directed by Monty Python alum Terry Gilliam, but Gilliam is already preparing for his next project, Zero Theorem. Billy Bob Thornton will star in Zero Theorem as a reclusive computer genius who finds himself wracked with existential angst while working on a project which he hopes will either produce the answer to the meaning of life, or prove that there isn’t one. Considering how often Gilliam’s attempts to get movies made have hit brick walls, it’s nice to see two of his projects coming together so closely together. Filming of Zero Theorem is scheduled to start in May.#9 CAMILLA BELLE TO BE MARY, MOTHER OF CHRISTIt’s only been a little over two years since Keisha Castle-Hughes (Whale Rider) starred as the Virgin Mary in The Nativity Story, but the greatest story ever told is going to get told again. Camilla Belle (10,000 B.C., Push) has signed to play the title character in Mary, Mother of Christ, which MGM plans to release on Good Friday (April 2nd), 2010. Other cast members are expected to include Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (as both Gabriel and Lucifer), Jessica Lange, Peter O’Toole and as King Herod, Al Pacino (who also signed this week to play the lead in King Lear). Alejandro Agresti (The Lake House) is directing, and filming is scheduled to start in Morocco in May.#10 ORLANDO BLOOM TO CROSS THE BORDEROrlando Bloom, Vincent Cassel and Olga Kurylenko have signed on to star in The Cross, a futuristic sci-fi thriller to be directed by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, Lord of War). Set in the near future, The Cross is the story of a man (Bloom) who dares to cross a mysterious, forbidden border near his town, with Cassel playing the guard who is out to stop him. The story sounds a bit like the premise of M. Night Shyamalan’s The Village, and considering that Andrew Niccol also wrote The Truman Show, here’s hoping that it doesn’t turn out that what’s on the other side of the border isn’t something like a suburban highway or a big blue wall. Filming starts in July in Australia on a budget of $24 million.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message and Greg also blogs about the TV show Lost, at TwoLosties.Blogspot.com.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"BAFTA, Crunchyroll, Kids, spanish, Originals, Winter, Guide, pirates, Crackle, Pop","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Green-Lights-for-Green-Lantern-and-Candy-Land"},{"id":"47617223245208","title":"New on Hulu in May 2021","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})New on Hulu in May 2021The third and final season of Shrill, psychological horror film Saint Maud, and season 1 of Marvel's M.O.D.O.K. are among the new titles premiering on Hulu in May.by Jean Bentley | April 19, 2021 |  CommentsThe weather’s getting warmer, but don’t worry if you’re not quite prepared to face the outside world just yet.

Just as her quick wit is winning them over, strange happenings and holes in her backstory incite paranoia surrounding her true mission. But this crew has more to fear… lurking in the shadows, something sinister is tearing at the heart of the plane. Trapped between an oncoming air ambush and an evil lurking within, Maude must push beyond her limits to save the hapless crew and protect her mysterious cargo.Critics Consensus: Part creature feature, part war movie, and part social commentary, Shadow in the Cloud doesn’t always blend its ingredients evenly — but it’s frequently pulpy fun.Premiere Date:&nbsp;May 5, 2021Shrill: Season 3 (2020) 87%Description: Season 3 of Shrill finds Annie (Aidy Bryant) energized by her breakup with dud boyfriend Ryan and her newfound momentum at work.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Included in the mix are new roles for two of the stars of Game of Thrones, sequel news for Red 3, and a new role for one of the stars of that franchise, Morgan Freeman.  All that and a remake of Timecop.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nFOX ENGAGES MARVEL IN THE GREAT QUICKSILVER RUSH OF ’13: X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST VS THE AVENGERS 2\n\nThis week gave us a pretty solid example of why maybe it’s not always the best thing for the creatives involved in highly anticipated genre projects to try to give the “fans” all of the hot details about movies that haven’t even started filming yet.  Those who have been following The Avengers 2 closely will remember that in the last couple of weeks, Joss Whedon first hinted, and then confirmed, that he was planning on using the sibling heroes Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who are also the mutant children of Magneto.  And it’s that last point that might have been a reason for Joss Whedon to hold off on revealing his plans until after a certain 20th Century Fox movie finished filming.  Because, sure enough, director Bryan Singer revealed this week that a young actor named Evan Peters has been cast as the super speedster Quicksilver in X-Men: Days of Future Past.  Almost overnight, Quicksilver has gone from being a Marvel superhero that most non-comic book fans have probably never heard of to being a potential major stumbling block for The Avengers 2.  The question for Joss Whedon is whether he just ignores the X-Men use of the character, or does a last minute rewrite to replace Quicksilver with some other character (or maybe just uses Scarlet Witch by herself instead of half a sister-brother team).  Speaking of which, when the Scarlet Witch news first broke, there was talk that Marvel Studios was using actress Saoirse Ronan (The Host, The Lovely Bones) as the model for casting (ie, trying to get actresses “like” Saoirse Ronan).  Or maybe they could just cast Saoirse Ronan.  The question was posed to the actress this week, and her reply was, “Yeah, of course I would.  I love Joss and I love those films, and I love his handle on them and how he portrayed these kinds of superheroes…. So yeah, I’d love to be in it.”  The hex bolt is back in Marvel’s corner.  X-Men: Days of Future Past is scheduled for July 18, 2014, some ten months before the May 1, 2015 release date for The Avengers 2.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 PETER DINKLAGE AS HOP FROG WILL BE BATTERED AND BRUISED, BUT THE KING WILL BE AMUSED\n\nSomewhere out there there is someone who can get that reference sans Google.  Anyway, in what may be a case of casting destiny, Peter Dinklage has signed on to play a court jester (sort of) in the Edgar Allan Poe adaptation Hop Frog.  Dinklage will play a puppeteer who poses as a court jester to get his revenge on the knights who murdered his uncle and kidnapped the woman he loves.  Hop Frog will be directed by Mark Palansky, whose only RT Tomatometer entry is the 2006 film Penelope, which only scored a mixed rating of 53%.  However, this is a movie in which Peter Dinklage (arguably the actor that makes Game of Thrones work) actually gets to star and be awesome for the entirety of a movie, and so, that sort of tips the scale back towards this being a Fresh story.  It’s a weak week, so it’s even the top one.\n\n\n\t\n#2 FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA TO DIRECT ANOTHER 20TH CENTURY ITALIAN AMERICAN FAMILY EPIC\n\nThe down side to directing two of the greatest films in American cinematic history when you’re 33 and 35 is that there’s a very good chance that the rest of your life will be spent never quite living up to that accomplishment.  That specific example is Francis Ford Coppola, who directed The Godfather and The Godfather Part II in 1972 and 1974 (which makes him born in 1939, which becomes important in this story very soon).  After years spent trying to get an ambitious movie called Megalopolis made, Coppola ended up spending the last decade directing little movies like Youth Without Youth, Tetro, and Twixt.  For his next film, Coppola may finally be returning to his roots, as it will be about an Italian American family set across the span from the 1930s to the 1960s.  The untitled drama is also said to be a coming-of-age story that focuses on a boy and girl in their late teens.  Now, let’s go back and consider that Coppola himself was born in 1939, which suggests that the boy in question might be himself (Coppola was in his late teens in the late 1950s).  Francis Ford Coppola has set up a production office on the Paramount Pictures lot, but as of right now, the studio behind The Godfather is not directly involved.\n\n\n\t\n#3 BANDERAS, SHEEN, AND PAULO FROM LOST HEADLINE THE CHILEAN MINERS DRAMA THE 33\n\nMost of the big announcements at Cannes happened last week, but there’s a few stragglers.  One of them concerns The 33, the previously announced drama about the Chilean miners who were trapped for 69 days back in 2010.  We now know who three of the stars of that movie will be.  The headliner will be Antonio Banderas, who will play the charismatic miner Mario Sepulveda, known to his coworkers as “Super Mario” (no word yet as to whether he wears red overalls).  The cast will be an ensemble, and two of those actors will be Martin Sheen and Rodrigo Santoro, who played Xerxes in 300, but is more recognizable to LOST fans as Paulo from Season 3.  The 33 will be directed by Mexican director Patricia Riggen.\n\n\t\n#4 THIS WEEK IN SPY MOVIE NEWS: RED 3 AND TOM CRUISE DISOWNS HIS U.N.C.L.E.\n\nThe sequel Red 2 doesn’t open in theaters for another two months yet on July 19, but Summit Entertainment is already starting development on Red 3.  The Lionsgate subsidiary is doing that by hiring screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber, who also worked on the first two movies.  There’s no announced deals yet with any of the various franchise stars, such as Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, or Catherine Zeta-Jones.  However, what is known is that Red 3 will involve the retired “black ops” agents teaming up to track down a loose portable nuclear device.  Another (would be) spy franchise that hit a major obstacle this week is Warner Bros’ adaptation of the 1960s TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E.  Tom Cruise was to have starred as the American spy Napoleon Solo (opposite Armie Hammer as his Russian counterpart), but this week, Tom Cruise dropped out completely to focus instead on Mission: Impossible 5.  Warner Bros still hopes to start filming in the fall, but the hunt is back on because Tom is back on as (Ethan) Hunt.\n\n\n\t\n#5 EMILIA CLARKE FROM GAME OF THRONES PLAYS SHAKESPEARE’S JULIET IN ROSALINE\n\nThis was a good week for fans of the stars of Game of Thrones, as Emilia Clarke (who plays Daenerys Targaryen) has been cast as Shakespeare’s Juliet in Rosaline.  The title character will be played by Allison Williams (from HBO’s Girls), and will be the first girlfriend of Romeo (played by Dave Franco from 21 Jump Street), in a bit of revisionist storytelling that changes the focus in a style that’s being compared to the Broadway musical Wicked.  Universal Pictures has picked up Rosaline from Fox 2000 out of turnaround.  The script was written by the team of Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, who also worked on the Sundance hits (500) Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now.\n\n\t\n#6 MORGAN FREEMAN AND DIANE KEATON STAR IN COMEDY LIFE ITSELF\n\nMorgan Freeman and Diane Keaton are signed to star in the “heartwarming comedy” Life Itself for director Richard Loncraine (Wimbledon, Richard III, The Special Relationship).  Freeman and Keaton will play a long-married New York couple whose lives are disrupted when they become engaged in a bidding war for the sale of their apartment.  Unfortunately, Life Itself will probably be released in an “off month” like February, April, or September, and three months later, most people will have forgotten the movie ever existed.\n\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\n#3 LIAM HEMSWORTH TO TEST OUT AURORA RISING\n\nLiam Hemsworth (from The Hunger Games and also Thor’s non-Loki brother) has been cast in the action movie Aurora Rising.  Hemsworth will play a California surfer who becomes a military fighter pilot who is eventually recruited to be a test pilot for a new generation of aircraft just before a new international conflict begins.  The script was written by screenwriter Christian Gudegast, cowriter of A Man Apart, and it’s that movie’s very low RT Tomatometer score that mostly justified this being one of the Rotten Ideas of the Week.\n\n\t\n#2 ZAC EFRON IN NARC: NEITHER A RAY LIOTTA REMAKE OR AN ADAPTATION OF THE 1980S ARCADE GAME\n\n20th Century Fox has acquired the life rights behind a true crime project called Narc, with Zac Efron attached to star.  Narc will tell the true story of a college student who used his status as a fraternity president and la crosse team captain to become an informant for the local police narcotics team. Narc is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because of Zac Efron’s RT Tomatometer scores.  However, as the story title alluded, it’s also because Narc was already the title of a pretty great Ray Liotta/Jason Patric movie.  Go rent that one instead.\n\n\n\t\n#1 REBOOTS ARE STILL A “THING”… NEXT UP: TIMECOP?\n\nBy this point, there’s almost no titles from the 1980s that haven’t either been remade/rebooted, or are lingering in development.  And so, the next hot decade for this trend is the 1990s.  And a movie that came out in 1994 was Timecop, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as a cop of time.  Universal Pictures has started development on a remake of Timecop, and the funniest thing about this story might be how every story about it stresses that Jean-Claude Van Damme will not be involved in any capacity.  Timecop also has the distinction of being one of those movies (like say, The Mask or Men in Black) that was technically based upon a comic book, but almost no one knew that at the time.  Anyway, Timecop is pretty much exactly what you would expect it to be: it’s the distant future of 2004 where cops regulate the use of time travel, and there’s a bad guy who uses time travel for his nefarious deeds, and then JCVD kicks time traveling bad guys… IN THE FACE.  And now it’s going to happen all over again.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"shows","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Fox-and-Marvel-Both-Courting-Quicksilver-for-Comic-Blockbusters"},{"id":"47509213423217","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Dreamworks Announces 12-film Schedule for 2013-2016","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Dreamworks Announces 12-film Schedule for 2013-2016\n                        Plus, new roles for Al Pacino, Tobey Maguire, and Elizabeth Banks, plus a Brave Little Toaster remake.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 14, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week, Hollywood finally started to recover from their long two-week lapse in movie development news due to the end of summer, including Labor Day weekend.  Bouncing back from this near hiatus, Hollywood has given us new movies featuring Brad Pitt, three different stories involving CGI animation, a few unnecessary remakes, and biopics about the lives of Emily Dickinson and Coach Joe Paterno.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nDREAMWORKS ANIMATION ANNOUNCES AN AMBITIOUS TWELVE FILM SCHEDULE FOR 2013-2016\n\nNormally, animated films are announced one at a time (like most movies), but this week DreamWorks Animation revealed their release schedule for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, and in doing so, provided a more concrete idea of what they’re planning.  In the year 2013, DreamWorks will give us the caveman comedy The Croods, the snail racing adventure Turbo, and the 1960s TV cartoon adaptation Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman, all of which were previously announced, including production images you can Google.  In 2014, DreamWorks’ plans include Me and My Shadow (which blends traditional animation with CGI), the sequel How to Train Your Dragon 2, and Happy Smekday!, which is an adaptation of a 2011 children’s book (The True Meaning of Smekday) about a future in which the human race has been enslaved by an alien race.  For 2015, there’s the spinoff The Penguins of Madagascar, the toy adaptation Trolls about those creepy little bug eyed dolls that were popular back in the 1960s-1970s, and B.O.O.: Bureau of Otherworldly Operations, which is speculated to be sort of like Men in Black but for ghosts, spirits and wraiths.  Finally, there are just two movies slated for 2016 (with a third probably not yet announced), which are Kung Fu Panda 3 and How to Train Your Dragon 3.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 BRAD PITT WANTS TO TELL YOU ABOUT IBM AND THE HOLOCAUST\n\nBrad Pitt is producing a feature film adaptation of the NYT bestselling non-fiction book IBM and the Holocaust, which as the title suggests, is about how IBM assisted the Nazis in the 1930s in identifying the Jews to help facilitate their extermination.  The feelgood movie of the year, this probably will not be.   An adaptation of the book had formerly been silently in development at HBO, but now Brad Pitt is shopping it around to studios and production companies as a theatrical feature film that he may star in, to help sell what is obviously a very heavy and more-than-potentially controversial subject.  While it was at HBO, the script was adapted by Marcus Hinchey, cowriter of the 2010 Ryan Gosling film All Good Things, and it appears that it is still Hinchey’s script that Brad Pitt is shopping around town.  IBM and the Holocaust isn’t, however, the only story set in 1930s Germany that made the news this week.  Although he was just mentioned two weeks ago in this column as the director of a comedy called Will, Michel Hazanavicius made the news again this week for being in talks to direct another film.  Tom Hanks is producing and will star in In the Garden of Beasts, which is an adaptation of a non-fiction book about the U.S. ambassador to Germany during the late 1930s.  Natalie Portman is also in consideration to play the daughter of the ambassador, who will be played by Hanks himself.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THAT SEQUEL TO HOPE AND GLORY THE WORLD’S BEEN CLAMORING FOR FINALLY ARRIVES AS QUEEN AND COUNTRY\n\nThere are certain genres of movies that are particularly conducive to sequels, like horror flicks, comedies, superhero movies, etc.  Decidedly unlike any of those is the 1987 family dramedy Hope and Glory, which was written and directed by John Boorman (Deliverance, Excalibur) about his own childhood experience during the Blitz in London during WWII.  That film will be celebrating its 25th anniversary this November, and at the same time, Boorman will be continuing to work on a sequel to be called Queen and Country.  Caleb Landry Jones (Banshee from X-Men: First Class) has been cast as the older Bill Rowan in a story set during the Korean War that will also reference Queen Elizabeth’s coronation in 1952.   Filming of Queen and Country is expected to start soon, and then Caleb Landry Jones will reunite again with director John Boorman on a science fiction project called Broken Dream.\n\n\n\t\n#3 UNIVERSAL PICTURES IS LITERALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON SEQUELS\n\nThis story is more about the big picture, but it does include a couple of details about specific movies.  The headline here is that the CEO of NBC/Universal (Steve Burke) said this week that Universal Pictures is going to focus in the near future more on “franchises and animation.” Two sequels that were mentioned as examples were the fifth film in the Bourne franchise (which is rumored to possibly feature both Jeremy Renner and Matt Damon), and Ted 2, the sequel to this summer’s hit from Seth McFarlane and Mark Wahlberg.   This emphasis on sequels at Universal may have been predictable when one considers how quickly Kick-Ass 2: Balls to the Wall went from being possibly forever shelved to being cast and in production within just a few months. As for the animation half of this story, Universal Pictures is expected to ramp up their animated slate from two movies every three years to two movies every year.  The bulk (indeed, probably the entirety) of those animated movies are expected to come from Illumination Entertainment. Illumination certainly has enough projects in development to meet this new demand, including The Addams Family, Clifford the Big Red Dog, Curious George, Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat, Emily the Strange, and Woody Woodpecker.\n\n\n\t\n#4 CYNTHIA NIXON: FROM SEX AND THE CITY TO PLAYING EMILY DICKINSON IN A QUIET PASSION\n\nDirector/screenwriter Terence Davies (The House of Mirth, The Deep Blue Sea) recently wrote a screenplay about the life of 19th century poet Emily Dickinson called A Quiet Passion, with a very specific actress in mind.  This week in Toronto, it was announced that the actress was Cynthia Nixon (Miranda from Sex and the City), and that she has signed on to star in the independent biopic drama.  The film will cover Dickinson’s entire life “from precocious schoolgirl to the tortured recluse who saw only seven of her more than 1,000 poems pubished in her lifetime.”   And now, let’s finish this story with a quote from the 2009 Robin Williams movie, World’s Greatest Dad, responding to a question from a student about whether Emily Dickinson was “hot:” “She was a Victorian.  If you like your buttoned-down girls, she was one of them.”  Quoting Bobcat Goldthwait about whether Emily Dickinson was hot was why the Internet was given to us.\n\n\n\t\n#5 TOBEY MAGUIRE AND FOX ANIMATION TEAM UP FOR CARDBOARD\n\nOnce upon a time, there was no fancy CGI animation, and children usually had to imagine their own wonders.  Now, Tobey Maguire is teaming up with Fox Animation to produce a CGI animated movie about that exact topic, which of course, has the potential to be ironic, but only if the finished film isn’t aware of that very contradiction.  Cardboard will be an adaptation of a graphic novel by Doug TenNapel about a little boy whose broke father gives him a cardboard box for his birthday, which the boy then imagines comes to life, leading to an adventure of the imagination.  Tobey Maguire might also provide his voice (probably as the father?).  Cardboard, if it moves forward, is being eyed as a possible directing job for Chris Wedge (Ice Age, Robots). Cardboard is the third project that Doug TenNapel has sold to Hollywood, after two adaptations in development at Disney called Ghostopolis and Monster Zoo.\n\n\n\t\n#6 AL PACINO GOES FROM JACK KEVORKIAN TO JOE PATERNO\n\nAl Pacino may have thought he played a divisive real life character when he starred in HBO’s You Don’t Know Jack as Dr. Jack Kevorkian, but the movie that was announced this week might make that look like… a movie that isn’t controversial.  Al Pacino’s name is attached to a film project that is being shopped around Hollywood that is based on the currently bestselling book Paterno by Joe Posanski, about the life of longtime Penn State football coach Joe Paterno.  Ever since his death, there have been expectations that Paterno’s story would be adapted as a feature film eventually, basically because his story so closely matches a traditional three-act character arc. Paterno became “the winningest coach in college football history,” and then just as his legacy seemed entirely ensured, a horrible scandal brought it all down, to the point that Penn State actually removed his statue recently.  This writer could get into more detail as to what the film’s third act will probably entail, but he just ate, thanks.  There’s no writer or director attached yet, and as of this writing, it’s still only being shopped around.  As for the idea itself of Pacino playing Paterno… well, they do sort of resemble each other, and their names are similar.\n\n\n\t\n#7 ELIZABETH BANKS AND DIANE LANE KNOW EVERY SECRET THING\n\nIndependent documentary filmmaker Amy Berg (Deliver Us from Evil, West of Memphis) is making the transition to independent drama with a crime story called Every Secret Thing, to be produced by actress Frances McDormand.  Elizabeth Banks and Diane Lane are attached to star, but it’s unclear what their roles will be, as the premise seems to describe lead characters who are much younger than they are: “At 11-years-old, Ronnie and Alice were convicted for the murder of a baby and were incarcerated until they turned 18. Now newly released and replete with psychological problems, each attempts to adjust to life outside juvenile detention… when children start to go missing. As the police turn their attention to Ronnie and Alice, the mystery surrounding the original murder and their roles in it takes the fore.”  Filming of Every Secret Thing is scheduled to start in February, 2013.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 BORN FREE AND BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER BOTH TO GET UNNECESSARY REMAKES\n\nThis story concerns two family friendly movies that were released in 1966 and 1987.  Let me inject a little autobiographical information here: as someone born in 1970, this writer was born too late to experience the pop culture sensation that was Born Free directly, and by the time Brave Little Toaster came out, I was too old to claim that it was an important part of my childhood (I was 17).  The reason this gets mentioned is that most of the online writers who covered this news the week that both properties are being targeted for remakes by the same company seem to really treasure Brave Little Toaster as part of their youth.  Whereas, this specific writer (me), is stuck in the middle, and quite frankly, I’m actually more familiar with Born Free because it was rerun on TV quite a bit during the 1970s.  Anyway, here’s the very brief facts:  Born Free was released in 1966, and told the true story of a couple in Africa who raised an orphaned lion cub to eventually become Elsa the Lioness, who is released happily back into the wild (presumably).  This week brought the news that producer Steve Waterman, one of the people behind both the Stuart Little and Alvin and the Chipmunks film franchises, wants to remake Born Free as a movie told from the perspective of Elsa the Lioness herself.  As for Brave Little Toaster (the original of which was one of the first films that Pixar’s John Lasseter was involved with), the plan appears to be to update the animation as a combination of CGI and live action.  The story appears to be about five household appliances going off on an adventure; at least, that’s what I read on Wikipedia, to be completely honest.   Regardless, the idea of Born Free and/or Brave Little Toaster being updated all Alvin and the Chipmunks style doesn’t seem like it could possibly be considered a “fresh development,” and so here we are.\n\n\n\t\n#1 ALL OF ME, WHY MUST THEY REMAKE ALL OF ME? CAN’T THEY SEE, IT’S A ROTTEN I-DE-A?\n\nDreamWorks is “quietly” developing a remake of the 1984 comedy hit All of Me, about Lily Tomlin’s ghost possessing the body of Steve Martin.  All of Me was also directed by Carl Reiner, and currently has a RT Tomatometer score of 90%.  This isn’t the first time a studio considered remaking the film; at one time, New Line Cinema almost made one that would have starred Queen Latifah, back in the era when Queen Latifah regularly headlined major studio comedies.  Whatever one thinks of that, the DreamWorks remake has an even lamer twist.  In this remake, instead of it being the ghost of a woman inside a man, it would be a ghost of a man inside of a man.  In other words, the premise is being fundamentally changed to the point where it no longer even resembles All of Me at all.  However, the title would remain the same, and the legacy of the original film would still be tainted.  The screenwriters of this All of Me remake are Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, whose recent film was The Vow, which is “Rotten” on the RT Tomatometer with a score of 30%.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"criterion, TV, Film, tv, Hallmark, deadpool, Nat, live","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Dreamworks-Announces-12film-Schedule-for-20132016"},{"id":"47508706400276","title":"The 22 Worst Christmas Movies Ever: The Rottenest Holiday Films Of All Time","content":"\n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                    \n                                                \nThe Worst Christmas Movies\nFrom painful family reunions to sequels no child asked for to multiple Vince Vaughn and Tim Allen vehicles, these are all the Christmas films that scored less than 30% on the Tomatometer. And to make sure these movies landed on enough critics’ naughty lists to be deemed truly universally loathed, every entry had to have at least 20 reviews for inclusion. This leaves the likes of Kirk Cameron’s Saving Christmas and Nativity 3: Dude, Where’s My Donkey?! out in the cold, but makes plenty of space for Home Alone 3, Christmas With the Kranks, and Deck the Halls.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

In particular, the Sundance Midnight program has a bit of a reputation behind it; it’s where we first saw films like&nbsp;His House, Hereditary, The Babadook, Get Out, and even The Blair Witch Project. This year, however, it was possible to find your favorite new genre film across the entire program, be it a documentary, an animated film, or a new Nicolas Cage extravaganza of weirdness.Let the fancy awards watchers worry about what movie from the festival will go on to win trophies. We’re here to round up the weird, creepy, scary, bizarre genre movies from this year’s program that are likely to make a big impression when they get released. 67% The Blazing World (2021)(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Part&nbsp;Alice in Wonderland, part giallo-inspired nightmare, the feature directorial debut of&nbsp;Carlson Young&nbsp;is a strong first impression starring the always-deliciously-evil&nbsp;Udo Kier&nbsp;as an enigmatic dream guide. It’s a film bursting with imagination and a unique visual style, and enough bright reds to satisfy fans of&nbsp;Dario Argento.Bloody Disgusting’s Meagan Navarro&nbsp;praises Young’s debut, describing the film as “bold, ambitious, and confident, and refusing to adhere to commercial conformity.” Meanwhile,&nbsp;Matt Donato of What to Watch&nbsp;celebrates the film’s cinematography&nbsp;and fantasy atmosphere, writing, “The camera glides in an unconscious state and draws the most candy-coated, delightfully whimsical hues from a movie that might as well take place in the Gumdrop Forest. What do you get? A tickled-transcendent collaboration of talents that’s en-vogue, saccharine-sweet, and establishes world building in a fraction of the time most other films require.”Then there’s Udo Kier himself, a legend in horror filmmaking who plays a creepy, mysterious entity in the film.&nbsp;Nerdist’s Kyle Anderson&nbsp;writes of the actor, “Udo Kier gives exactly the kind of scary Udo Kier performance you want. An excellent casting choice to represent literal inner demons.” 87% Censor (2021)(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)The 1980s were a golden age for horror fans, with the birth of home video allowing bold new voices to defy censorship and conventional distribution — leading to the “video nasty” era of British horror cinema. But what if a film looked eerily similar to the disappearance of your own sister years prior? Censor blurs the lines between fiction and reality in a feature debut that heralds the arrival of a brave new voice in horror, and a love letter to a bygone era of cinema.The best-reviewed horror film out of the festival so far, Censor is being declared “the future of British filmmaking,” by the likes of Little White Lies’ Hannah Woodhead. Only time will tell if the hype is real, but for now, audiences can look forward to a confident feature debut by Prano Bailey-Bond&nbsp;and a captivating, blood-soaked performance by Raised by Wolves’ Niamh Algar. Critics are also praising the film’s graceful and nuanced approach to the debate of violence in film. Daily Grindhouse’s Mary Beth McAndrews writes, “Bailey-Bond contrasts over-the-top violent images in these films with violence shown on the news, as if exaggerated fictional violence is somehow worse than the horrific events that unfold in the world on a daily basis.” 87% Coming Home in the Dark (2021)(Photo by Goldfish Creative courtesy of Sundance Institute)Sometimes, a film is so intense that even the festival programmers warn the audience about what they’re about to watch.&nbsp;Coming Home in the Dark&nbsp;is definitely not for the faint of heart. Horror films have a unique ability to comment on the darkest, most unspeakable parts of the human condition while still delivering entertaining and thrilling rides, and this film definitely gets to some dark places.Early reactions from critics describe this film as&nbsp;“bleak, tense, and often unshakable,”&nbsp;as Chris Evangelista wrote for SlashFilm. In a tight 90 minutes,&nbsp;James Ashcroft&nbsp;delivers an anxiety-inducing film&nbsp;you simply can’t take your eyes off of, one that is frequently unpleasant but never boring.&nbsp;What to Watch’s Matt Donato&nbsp;writes, “Ashcroft executes horrors of commonplace means through barbarism, revenge, and admittance. Not without his acting troupe’s investment.” A big part of the film’s success in holding your attention is&nbsp;Daniel Gillies’&nbsp;performance as one of two murderous drifters holding a family captive during a night of utter terror. As&nbsp;Screen Zealots’ Louisa Moore&nbsp;writes, “Gillies gives a spine-chilling performance as a quietly unhinged lunatic, and he’s able to establish so much fear with nothing but a menacing stare.” 71% Cryptozoo (2021)(Photo by Johnny Dell'Angelo courtesy of Sundance Institute)What do you get when you combine the plot of&nbsp;Jurassic Park, the visuals of&nbsp;Yellow Submarine, and the mind of one of the most unique voices currently working in animation? The bizarre, colorful, and fascinating world of&nbsp;Cryptozoo.SlashFilm’s Hoai-Tran Bui&nbsp;describes&nbsp;Cryptozoo&nbsp;as “the slyly anti-Disney film, digging into the idea of capitalizing on the magic of the world and turning it into a corporate product.” The film is about a sanctuary for mythical creatures and the shady military guys who are hellbent on using the creatures for their own nefarious purposes. The consensus seems to be that the film’s strongest asset is its unique kaleidoscopic animation, which&nbsp;Eric Kohn describes for IndieWire&nbsp;as “a cluttered symphony of erratic line drawings, psychedelic colors, and recycled genre tropes galore.” Because animation is more than just kid-friendly content, viewers should beware that&nbsp;Cryptozoo&nbsp;is definitely not for kids, but a film loaded with bloody shootouts, explicitly sexual content, and a surprising amount of gore. If you ever wanted to see a Gorgon having to escape the clutches of a giant Kraken while turning the soldiers chasing her into stone, this is the film for you. 76% Eight for Silver (2021)(Photo by Sean Ellis courtesy of Sundance Institute)The werewolf genre is in need of a comeback, because one can’t simply watch&nbsp;Underworld&nbsp;on repeat forever. So it’s great news that&nbsp;Anthropoid&nbsp;director&nbsp;Sean Ellis&nbsp;is giving us a much-needed fresh coat of silver on the werewolf movie with his new period horror film,&nbsp;Eight for Silver. In it,&nbsp;Boyd Holbrook&nbsp;acts as a Van Helsing type investigating some grisly murders and disappearances in the French countryside, where a mysterious set of silver teeth are bringing a lupine horror to the unsuspecting townsfolk.Most critics agree that the film brings some fascinating and gnarly additions to the werewolf myth:&nbsp;Bloody Disgusting’s Meagan Navarro&nbsp;wrote in her review, “This unique form of curse relies on some biblical evils, and the werewolf mythology itself gives thrilling glimpses of body horror that would make&nbsp;The Thing&nbsp;proud.” There’s also some love for Boyd Holbrook’s wolf hunter, with&nbsp;Brian Tallerico at rogerebert.com&nbsp;writing that the film includes “another game performance from Holbrook, who could make a career as a cinematic monster hunter and I’d be pretty happy.” 67% A Glitch in the Matrix (2021)(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Reality can be scarier than fiction; that much we’ve learned from&nbsp;Rodney Ascher’s films. Ascher has made a career out of peeking into what makes our imaginations run wild and&nbsp;dissecting the things that we’re obsessed with, most notably in 2012’s&nbsp;Room 237, which explored the wild conspiracy theories surround Stanley Kubrick’s classic horror film&nbsp;The Shining. Ascher’s latest,&nbsp;A Glitch in the Matrix, is all about another conspiracy theory that has slowly grown over the last couple of decades: the idea that we all live inside a computer simulation. It’s a frightening thought made all the&nbsp;more terrifying by Ascher’s&nbsp;deep dive into why people believe this theory.Writing for the&nbsp;AV Club, A. A. Dowd&nbsp;praises the film’s exploration of human obsession, stating “This film uses simulation theory as a window into the desperately human search for order and logic, with technology as just another variant on some grand designer outside the membrane of our consciousness.” Meanwhile,&nbsp;Nonfics’ Christopher Campbell&nbsp;writes of its potential as a horror film, “A Glitch in the Matrix&nbsp;is a perfect midnight movie because it does eventually become something of a horror movie but is also the sort of trippy feature, with its heady metaphysical subject matter combined with its surreal visuals, that is going to welcome drug-fueled viewings.” 78% In The Earth (2021)(Photo by Neon courtesy of Sundance Institute)Ben Wheatley returns to his folk horror origins with a timely, psychedelic film that was part of a new wave of pandemic-themed movies at this year’s Sundance. In the Earth is a movie about paranoia and isolation and a true attack on the senses that overcomes even the “at-home” part of Sundance to deliver an effective horror film filled with dread. This is in part due to a fantastic, synth-heavy score by Clint Mansell that includes plants in its sounds.So far, early reviews are praising this as Wheatley’s return to form after his disappointing remake of&nbsp;Rebecca&nbsp;for Netflix, and it’s a gnarly return at that. For SlashFilm, Chris Evangelista writes that “There’s a wealth of close-ups here of ruined, bleeding, open flesh; of skin stitched up with foreign objects inserted beneath the surface. It’s all so gross and weird and kind of wonderful.” Meanwhile, Consequence of Sound’s Joe Lipsett recognizes that those along for the ride will find a unique sensorial experience, writing, “Restless audiences may quibble with the pacing and length, but fans of bombastic visual sequences and discomforting violence will find plenty to like.” 79% Knocking (2021)(Photo by Hannes Krantz courtesy of Sundance Institute)At one point or another, everyone has had experience with an annoying neighbor who makes noise at inappropriate times, but what if that noise — say, a knocking sound — began to sound like cries for help? And what if, when confronted, no one seems to be able to hear the knocking? That is just the beginning of Molly’s (Cecilia Milocco) problems in the new Swedish horror film&nbsp;Knocking.&nbsp;Pajiba’s Kristy Puchko&nbsp;is enthusiastic about&nbsp;Knocking&nbsp;in her review, writing “Methodically paced and keenly tense, this thriller draws you in with the openness of Milocco’s visage, then hooks you with its titular inciting incident,” comparing the film to the works of&nbsp;Darren Aronofsky&nbsp;in their handling of insanity, vulnerability, and obsession.&nbsp;Frida Kempff’s film is unapologetically about gaslighting and the threat it continues to be to women, and the film plays with the audience’s expectations as it makes viewers reconsider what is and isn’t real.If there’s one consensus, it’s that Cecilia Milocco delivers a knockout performance here.&nbsp;Nightmarish Conjurings’ Sarah Musnicky&nbsp;writes, “Her performance easily grips onto the audience’s hearts and pulls them along with her as all we can do is watch Molly spiral onscreen. With a mixture of vulnerability and strength as Molly fixates on saving whoever is trying to initiate contact, the magic and glue of this film is truly found in her.” 74% Prisoners of the Ghostland (2021)(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Japanese director Sion Sono makes his English-language film debut with arguably the most bonkers film to have graced Sundance moviegoers’ screens since Mandy; this one just also happens to star&nbsp;Nicolas Cage.The film is a unique blend of Eastern and Western sensibilities, and finds Cage playing a former bank robber strapped into a black leather suit rigged with explosives (including one for each of his privates) and tasked with rescuing the governor’s adopted granddaughter from the “Ghostland” before his suit explodes. Writing for Nightmare on Film Street, Kimberley Elizabeth describes the film as “a melting pot dystopia of the nostalgic neons of both Eastern and Western culture.” Believe it or not, critics say that this could be Cage’s craziest film yet, with IndieWire’s David Ehrlich writing, “Cage screams at the sky while stretching the word ‘testicle’ for the length of an aria,” and that is enough to pique our interest.Though critics describe the film as a more muted Sion Sono, What to Watch’s Matt Donato still finds the director able to play with a largely practical world, “Sono’s prop-latent universe includes carnivalesque 18-wheelers outlined in neon light trims, modded arm-swords on mangled appendages, and Mad Maxian devastation that still carries creative flourishes.” That’s all well and good, but did we mention the testicle bombs? 87% Violation (2021)(Photo by One Plus One courtesy of Sundance Institute)Though Violation had its world premiere at TIFF last year, it’s part of the Sundance program this year, and it absolutely deserves recognition. This is a rape-revenge film with graphic violence that will make even hardcore horror fans squirm and raw, noteworthy performances.Indeed, many critics praise the central performance by Madeleine Sims-Fewer, including The Playlist’s Monica Castillo, who writes “Sims-Fewer’s incredible performance takes up space usually reserved for blood splattery comeuppance with a full gut-punch of intensity.” That being said, many critics also note that this film may be too shocking for some audience members. Pajiba’s Kristy Puchko writes, “It’s a film that strips away the artifices of genre to leave us with the bones of pain and horror. It then scrapes those bones, carving out a cinematic experience that is electrifying in its agony and empathy.”On an Apple device?

Think again! These stories of rampaging bulls, terrifying sea creatures, ghosts, and more will satisfy your genre thirst.by Rafael Motamayor | September 18, 2019 |  CommentsThe Toronto International Film Festival is usually best known for being the unofficial start to the awards season, with many of next year’s nominees making their debut at the Canadian festival. But among the hundreds of films showing in Toronto, there are some that wait far from the Oscar-bait madding crowd. After the day’s big red-carpet galas are done, the genre enthusiast crowd gathers at 11:59PM for the Midnight Madness program, which shows the boldest, sometimes most extreme films that horror, sci-fi, and fantasy filmmakers have to offer.This year, genre expanded beyond the confines of the late-night selection, as even the Contemporary World Cinema program — which usually focuses on art-house films that may not see wide releases — included a few titles that used horror tropes to tell poignant and contemporary stories. No matter what corner of the world these movies were made in, they all showed a love for genre cinema and its ability to make us care about real socio-political issues through pure entertainment. And the good news is that distributors and streaming services are likely to snatch them up and make them available to you soon.To help you plan your future watch list, we’ve put together a list highlighting some of the genre movies that blew audiences and critics alike away at TIFF and which show the wild directions horror, thrillers, and sci-fi flicks can be taken in.Jallikattu (2019)  96%&nbsp;(Photo by Opus Penta)A film that completely grabs you by surprise and never lets go, Lijo Jose Pellissery’s&nbsp;Jallikattu&nbsp;is a symphony of chaos, where a wild buffalo escapes and causes mayhem and violence in a remote Indian village. Hundreds of extras are seen running through the jungle wielding machetes and knives, with the movie playing out like an on-foot version of Mad Max: Fury Road with a bit of Spielberg’s Jaws&nbsp;thrown in; &nbsp;the buffalo is used sparingly, but its presence is always looming. It’s a film that will leave you wondering how they managed not to accidentally kill anyone during production. “When Jallikattu lets it rip, it’s as exciting and unusual an experience as you’re likely to get this year. Grab it by its horns and don’t dare let go,”&nbsp;writes&nbsp;Globe and Mail’s critic Barry Hertz of this exhilarating and unique cinematic experience.Sea Fever (2019)  87%&nbsp;Aquatic horror is a bit of an underseen sub-genre, but Neasa Hardiman’s&nbsp;Sea Fever&nbsp;shows why we should still be afraid of what lies beneath, as a bizarre creature sneaks on board a trawler on the high seas. This film will remind audiences of such classics as&nbsp;Alien&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Thing&nbsp;while offering a new voice to the creature feature, with an engrossing tale that challenges your assumptions of the unknown.&nbsp;“Sea Fever is a nightmare you can’t take your eyes off of and can’t stop thinking about after it wraps up,”&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;Collider’s critic Perri Nemiroff.Bacurau (Nighthawk) (2020)  93%&nbsp;Right after the theatrical release of The Hunt was cancelled, TIFF presented us with an alternative to the Most Dangerous Game sub-genre, one that combines socio-political commentary with sci-fi and horror elements. RogerEbert.com’s Brian Tallerico described Bacarau, which also played the Cannes Film Festival,&nbsp;as “a crazy genre hybrid that exudes the confidence of the people who made it.” The premise is simple:&nbsp;In a&nbsp;near-future Brazilian village where citizens are sold as prey to bloodthirsty foreign hunter (led by cult-cinema legend Udo Kier), a resistance forms in an all-out war that allows the filmmakers to blend genres and blows minds. Psychotropic drugs are involved.Gundala (2019)  83%&nbsp;What if we were to tell you that the next big superhero cinematic universe wasn’t going to be based on American superheroes, but on Indonesian comic books? Writer-director Joko Anwar unleashed a different kind of superhero on the Midnight Madness crowds of Toronto with Gundala, a superhero origin film that&nbsp;infuses&nbsp;standard tropes of the genre with Indonesian legends and martial art fights that will make you cheer. That Shelf critic Victor Stiff says,&nbsp;“From beginning to end, Gundala delivers fast and furious action and rarely stops to take its foot off the gas.”Knives Out (2019)  97%&nbsp;(Photo by Lionsgate)One of the biggest surprises of TIFF was how universally liked Rian Johnson’s murder-mystery Knives Out turned out to be. The star-studded ensemble not only lets Chris Evans play a despicable character fresh off of&nbsp;hanging up the Captain America shield, but spoofs the classic whodunnit genre. What starts as a simple mystery of the murder of a crime novelist evolves into a laugh-out-loud puzzle-box comedy that will keep your mind spinning as you try to figure out what comes next. David Ehrlich writes for IndieWire: “A crackling, devious, and hugely satisfying old-school whodunnit with a modern twist…”. Lionsgate will release Knives Out on Thanksgiving.The Vigil (2021)  90%&nbsp;(Photo by BoulderLight Pictures)The demonic possession genre has long been associated with bibles and priests, but Keith Thomas’s debut feature, The Vigil,&nbsp;takes the genre and roots it in Jewish mythology making&nbsp;for a novel and terrifying horror film. Breakout performer Dave Davis stars as Jakov, a young man abandoning his Orthodox community to embrace the secular life, who finds himself working as a shomer, watching over the body of a recently deceased member of the community who is haunted by an evil presence. The Hollywood Reporter’s Jordan Mintzer writes,&nbsp;“What works… is how Thomas transforms Orthodox culture into gory material for a slightly elevated horror flick, with Yakov ultimately turning to Hebrew prayer as his only way out of hell.”The Vast of Night (2020)  92%&nbsp;A throwback to not only the classic sci-fi TV shows of the ’50s, like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits, but also a time when we were still fascinated with the idea of the future and the wonders it could bring, Andrew Patterson’s debut feature The Vast of Night follows two young people seeking the source of a mysterious sound invading their local radio station in a town in New Mexico. TV Guide’s Oliver Whitney writes that the film is&nbsp;“like an old school radio play that fuses the slow-building paranoia of The Twilight Zone and chilling awe and extraterrestrial sightings of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.” This nostalgic sci-fi thriller was picked up by Amazon just before the film’s premiere at TIFF.Synchronic (2020)  79%&nbsp;(Photo by Rustic Films )Filmmaking duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead have made a career out of blending different genres to create something entirely new, while also providing emotional stories stuffed with characters we connect with – their 2018 flick, The Endless, is Certified Fresh at 93%. This time they got Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan together to play the&nbsp;two friends at the core of a time-bending crime thriller involving two paramedics that get their lives turned upside down by a series of crimes involving a mysterious synthetic drug that lets you experience new realities. Synchronic is the duo’s most dramatic and emotional work yet, but it still delivers a fun and exhilarating experience.&nbsp;Writing for The Playlist, critic Jason Bailey says,&nbsp;“Synchronic can best be described as egghead indie sci-fi, in which the ideas are as exciting as the effects.” This is a sci-fi thriller that will stick with you long after you leave the theater.La Llorona (2020)  96%&nbsp;Unlike that other film about the Latin American horror myth, Jayro Bustamante’s La Llorona is 100% rooted in Latin American history and culture, which adds an extra layer of horror to this already chilling tale of an aging general accused of genocide who starts seeing visions of a terrifying ghost haunting his estate. Bustamante blends&nbsp;utilizes&nbsp;stylized cinematography and effective scares that make this the surprise horror hit of the festival. Critic Carlos Aguilar writes for The Wrap that La Llorona is “a purposefully somber cry for amends and acknowledgement permeated in phantasmagoric allure.” This is the type of genre film that proves you can have a strong message while still delivering entertaining thrills and scares.The Platform (El Hoyo) (2020)  80%&nbsp;Imagine a prison where the cells are vertically stacked, and the only food given to prisoners is lowered down from the highest levels – feeding those on the upper cells but leaving those below violently starving. Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia’s The Platform combines poignant and relevant social commentary about the&nbsp;distribution of wealth and the difficulties of convincing people to do good, with the nasty, wicked horrors of Bong Joon-ho’s Snowpiercer. Writing for Slashfilm, critic Meredith Borders says,&nbsp;“Starvation, cannibalism, heinous violence and no small amount of feces aside, The Platform&nbsp;makes spending time in The Pit a pretty intriguing enterprise.” This is a movie that is as grotesque and shocking as it is surprisingly funny. Netflix will release The Platform at a later date.Like this?

And, whew, it’s gonna be quite the evening – and not just for the glitz, glam, and speeches.The pandemic, with its shuffled release dates and changes to eligibility for various awards ceremonies, already made this year a different beast for the HFPA’s night of nights, but a slew of controversies have also colored the 2021 Globes. First came criticism after the&nbsp;organization decided that&nbsp;Minari, the American film with mostly Korean dialogue, would compete in the “foreign” category; then came the noticeable snubbing of multiple projects featuring Black creatives and casts on nominations morning. And then, just a week out from the ceremony, the&nbsp;L.A. Times&nbsp;dropped a bombshell investigation into the makeup (zero Black journalists are members) and ethics of the 87-member group.&nbsp;You can read the full piece here.Recommended: The Full List of Nominations for the 2021 Golden GlobesRecommended:&nbsp;Vote for the Winners In Our Online 2021 Golden Globes BallotYet the show will and must go on, in virtual form this year, with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosting from opposite sides of the country (and no doubt re-writing their material to address recent controversies even as we speak). And while some in the industry will snigger at and maybe even avoid the ceremony, it’s hard to deny its significance as on one of the biggest dates on the awards season calendar, both in (potentially) reshaping&nbsp;the Oscars race and giving TV networks and streamers some new marketing juice, and in its standing as one of the most widely-viewed awards ceremonies of the year.If you’re going to be viewing the Golden Globes, and perhaps wanna beat your buddies on a ballot, we’ve got you covered with our choices for who’s likely to win on the big night (and those who&nbsp;we feel truly deserve to win). Our experts – Jacqueline Coley for film and Debbie Day for TV and streaming – take into consideration everything from industry buzz and the tastes and historical leanings of the HFPA, to our Tomatometer and Audience Scores, to read the tea leaves and place their bets. How right will they be? Bookmark this page for Sunday night and find out.Check out our picks for the Golden Globes winners, and let us know who you think will be a win in the comments.Film | TelevisionFILMBest Motion Picture – Drama(Photo by © Searchlight Pictures)What will win? 94% Nomadland (2021)What&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?In a&nbsp;battle between Nomadland and&nbsp;The&nbsp;Trial of the Chicago 7,&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;a bit of a toss-up on who deserves it. However, the wanderlust drama starring Frances McDormand is&nbsp;one of the few studio films in competition this season,&nbsp;which we think is enough to tip the scales in its favor just for the sake of balance. Both worthy selections, but it’s hard to argue with Nomadland’s more than&nbsp;100 wins this awards season thus far.Best Motion Picture – Musical or ComedyWhat will&nbsp;win? 97% Hamilton (2020)What&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Hamilton. The HFPA did some – let’s call them&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;– calculations to justify including Hamilton here rather than with the other made-for-TV&nbsp;films and limited series (a ridiculously competitive category). We’d have to think&nbsp;they performed such leaps of logic for a reason. Plus, if Hamilton wins, we might&nbsp;get another incredible acceptance speech from Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda – always a good time and even better television. Oh, and yes:&nbsp;Hamilton&nbsp;is very,&nbsp;very&nbsp;worthy.Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama(Photo by David Lee/Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Viola Davis 98% Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Viola Davis. This is a&nbsp;bit of a wild card category, as none of the nominees have really run away with things so far this awards season. We could make a compelling argument that all have a right to win. All have snagged several prizes this season, but we are betting on Davis’ transformative turn as the larger-than-life Mother of the Blues, Ma Rainey, deservedly winning out. The notoriously finicky HFPA apparently raved about the film – particularly Davis’s performance.Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama(Photo by David Lee/Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?&nbsp;Chadwick Boseman 98% Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Even without the tragedy of his death, Chadwick Boseman was winning – as he should.Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy&nbsp;(Photo by Seacia Pavao / Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Rosamund Pike 78% I Care a Lot (2021)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Bucking the general thinking here, we have gone with an upset. With a small voting body, the Globes are highly unpredictable – so when Pike cut a nomination, we suspected it was due to how much the HPFA enjoyed the film and her darkly hilarious performance as a scheming care assistant. If you want to win your ballot, you have to give room for at least one surprise and we&nbsp;think this is where to do it. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm‘s&nbsp;Maria Bakalova is the odds-on safe bet, but bumping her to lead instead of supporting is a quizzical choice and hard to put up against Pike, who carried an entire movie under that fierce bob. Besides, where’s the fun in playing it safe?Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy&nbsp;(Photo by © Amazon)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Sacha Baron Cohen 85% Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?The HFPA really likes Sacha Baron Cohen.&nbsp;He is nominated three times this year and four times previously – it really comes down to where&nbsp;the group wants to honor him?&nbsp;Immersing himself in character for hours – with the burden of that thick and hilarious accent – to pull of Internet-shaking ruses… it’s hard to argue he’s not deserving.Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture(Photo by Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Amanda Seyfried 82% Mank (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?This is a complicated choice. Maria Bakalova should win here – she does give a supporting performance – but she’s in the Lead category so… As the David Fincher black-and-white drama has little hope of winning in the other categories, this is the best place for the Globes voters to show the tale of Citizen Kane‘s prickly screenwriter some love. And Seyfried is very, very good in the film.Best Supporting Actor – Motion PictureWho&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Daniel Kaluuya 96% Judas and the Black Messiah (2021)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Better late than never. Coming on late in the season, Daniel Kaluuya turn as Chairman Fred Hampton of the Chicago Black Panther Party has quickly emerged as a late-season frontrunner in this category. Leslie Odom Jr. – who has snapped up many of the prizes thus far for playing Sam Cooke in One Night In Miami&nbsp;–&nbsp;would also be a logical choice, but after snagging&nbsp;his second GGs nomination in just four years, we’re giving it to the&nbsp;Get Out star who more than deserves to take home the prize.Best Director – Motion Picture(Photo by Joshua Richards, 20th Century )Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Chloé Zhao 94% Nomadland (2021)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?In&nbsp;case you haven’t been keeping score,&nbsp;Zhao, the director of Marvel’s upcoming&nbsp;Eternals, has swept the major directing prizes this season. It would beyond shocking if she came up short here, and we don’t think she should or will… but the one name that could unseat her would be Aaron Sorkin for The Trial of the Chicago 7.Best Screenplay – Motion Picture(Photo by Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Aaron Sorkin 89% The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?In a category with more than a few glaring omissions, the film that should win is arguably not even among the nominees. Soul, One Night in Miami, Never Rarely Sometimes Always would all be welcome and worthy additions to this group, with all of them being heavily favored nominees for the Oscars ceremony in April.Best Motion Picture – Foreign LanguageWhat will&nbsp;win? 98% Minari (2020)What&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Minari. We love Another Round, and it would be a worthy winner, but this is yet another category where the HFPA might look to do a bit of damage control. Selecting Minari as the winner could go a long way to lowering the temperature&nbsp;on the controversy surrounding their “Foreign Language” classification of the film. Need a quick brush up on that controversy? The dialogue for Minari is spoken in mostly Korean, with only 30% in English, a ratio which relegated this 98% Certified Fresh American immigrant story to a foreign category. That raised some questions about a double standard:&nbsp;Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds, which featured similar language ratios, was&nbsp;nominated for Best Motion Picture – Drama in 2010.Best Motion Picture – Animated(Photo by Pixar)What will&nbsp;win? 95% Soul (2020)What&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Apple’s&nbsp;Wolfwalkers has a real chance to upset Pixar’s long-running&nbsp;dominance of this category, but with Soul‘s&nbsp;additional nomination for Best Score,&nbsp;we’re thinking the HFPA favors Pete Docter and Kemp Powers’ jazz-filled&nbsp;tale.Best Original Score – Motion PictureWhat will&nbsp;win? 95% Soul (2020)What&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Soul. With two nominations this year (Mank, Soul), it would be strange for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross not to take home the prize for Best Score. As it is assumed they are taking home a statue no matter what,&nbsp;Soul – a win for&nbsp;which&nbsp;would also honor Stephen Colbert’s bandleader Jon Batiste, who did the incredible jazz orchestrations – is the preferable option.Best&nbsp;Original Song – Motion Picture(Photo by Amazon Studios)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?“Speak Now” – Leslie Odom Jr. and Sam Ashworth 98% One Night in Miami (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Leslie Odom Jr. was our out-of-the-gate front-runner for Best Supporting Actor in every major contest earlier this year – but all that changed when Daniel Kaluuya recently joined the race with rave reviews, replacing the Hamilton alum as frontrunner there. Still, having&nbsp;Odom Jr.&nbsp;on stage to accept&nbsp;an award would be a great TV moment to tune in for, something every awards show is cognizant of this year, and this could be the category that gets him there.TELEVISIONBest Television Series – DramaWho&nbsp;will&nbsp;win? 96% The Crown: Season 4 (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?The Crown’s fourth season was spectacular in the same way that the unraveling of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage was a spectacle. The series will and should win for its portrayal of that drama, as well as the one unfolding at 10 Downing Street.Best Actress – Television Drama(Photo by Des Willie/Netflix)Who will win?Olivia Colman 96% The Crown: Season 4 (2020)Who should win?Emma Corrin was compelling in her role as Princess Diana in The Crown season 4 and Colman is certainly deserving, but Laura Linney should top this list for her strong, multi-layered performance in an emotional season 3 of Ozark. Colman&nbsp;should be recognized at least once this year; she’s also nominated for a Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture.Best Actor – Television Drama(Photo by Des Willie/Netflix)Who will win?Josh O’Connor 96% The Crown: Season 4 (2020)Who should win?O’Connor’s portrayal of Prince Charles was certainly riveting, but Bob Odenkirk&nbsp;was sublime in&nbsp;Better Call Saul&nbsp;season 5, which is Certified Fresh at 99% on the Tomatometer. Take episode 8 (“Bagman”), which follows Jimmy on an ill-fated roadtrip to Mexico that devolves into an overnight hike through the desert with Mike (Jonathan Banks). The Emmy-nominated episode and&nbsp;the storyline’s continuation&nbsp;in the also Emmy-nominated episode 9 (“Bad Choice Road”) served as a showcase for Banks as much as for Odenkirk, who inhabits the skin of Jimmy/Saul down to the last sun-crisped cell.Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy(Photo by ©CBC / courtesy Everett Collection)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win? 100% Schitt's Creek: Season 6 (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?The big question in the comedy categories is if the HFPA will follow the Emmys in honoring Schitt’s Creek and the Pop series’ actors. We’re betting they’ll split their support to spread the love around in that HFPA way, but Schitt’s Creek will get the big honor – as it should.Best Actress – Television Musical or Comedy(Photo by Pop)Who will win?Catherine O’Hara 100% Schitt's Creek: Season 6 (2020)Who should win?With the revelations on the HFPA’s relationship with Emily In Paris hitting before voting concludes, we’re expecting the membership to exercise more restraint in the final round of voting, ensuring that neither the series nor its star Lily Collins&nbsp;will receive awards. The situation makes it one less person&nbsp;competing against O’Hara, who will and should win for her portrayal of unhinged Rose family matriarch, Moira.Best Actor – Television Musical or Comedy(Photo by Ollie Upton/Hulu)Who will win?Nicholas Hoult 88% The Great: Season 1 (2020)Who should win?As part of the Emmys’ “Schitt’s Sweep,” Eugene Levy received the top comedy actor prize – and he should probably win here too – but the HFPA is a different organization. Ramy Youssef took the prize last year, but we expect the HFPA membership to woo Hoult with a prize for his performance in The Great. Huzzah!Best&nbsp;Miniseries or Television Film&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win? 97% The Queen's Gambit: Miniseries (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?With its collection of auteur films – that auteur being Steve McQueen of 12 Years a Slave fame – Small Axe feels somewhat out of place competing against the likes of The Queen’s Gambit, Unorthodox, Normal People, and The Undoing. It’s here, though, and matches The Queen’s Gambit’s 97% Tomatometer score. We think Netflix is going to win this particular streaming war for the phenomenon that was The Queen’s Gambit; though the Amazon Prime Video title may deserve it for its heartfelt storytelling experience.Best Actress – Miniseries or Television FilmWho will win?Anya Taylor-Joy 97% The Queen's Gambit: Miniseries (2020)Who should win?Despite facing off against big names Cate Blanchett (Mrs. America) and Nicole Kidman (The Undoing), and powerful performances from relative newcomers Shira Haas (Unorthodox) and Daisy Edgar-Jones (Normal People), Taylor-Joy reigns supreme in this category for her performance as chess prodigy Beth Harmon; she will and she should win — that is, unless HFPA members get star struck by either Blanchett or Kidman.Best Actor&nbsp;–&nbsp;Miniseries or Television Film&nbsp;(Photo by HBO)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Mark Ruffalo 74% I Know This Much Is True: Miniseries (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?We’ve said it again and again, Ruffalo took on two very different and equally challenging roles in I Know This Much Is True and deserves to prevail (as he did at the Emmys) for doing twice the work even if the overall series wasn’t a critics’ favorite.Best Supporting Actress –&nbsp;Series, Miniseries, or Television Film(Photo by Des Willie/Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Gillian Anderson 96% The Crown: Season 4 (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?After two back-to-back Emmy wins, the HFPA was finally convinced to nominate Ozark’s Julia Garner, who is indeed deserving for her role as Ruth Langmore, but this year she has the misfortune of competing against Anderson’s remarkable transformation into The Crown’s Margaret Thatcher. Emmy winner Annie Murphy, of Schitt’s Creek,&nbsp;has a hard road against those two powerful dramatic performances.Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film(Photo by Amazon Studios)Who will win?John Boyega 98% Small Axe: Red, White and Blue (2020)Who should win?It’s an awards season high crime&nbsp;that Better Call Saul isn’t represented (in Jonathan Banks or Giancarlo Esposito) and that Ozark’s Tom Pelphrey was also overlooked, despite his extraordinary performance as Wendy Byrde’s bipolar brother, Ben. The supporting categories too broadly encompass both drama and comedy, leaving Boyega — who shines in a&nbsp;lead&nbsp;role as Leroy Logan in “episode” Red, White and Blue’s true story — to face off against Dan Levy for Schitt’s Creek, which is just absurd.

The movies – with Tomatometer scores of 71% and 76% respectively – are his best reviewed works since his debut, Dawn of the Dead, back in 2004.While Army is no direct sequel to Dawn – different characters, different kinds of zombies here – it’s clear Snyder is relishing playing with the undead again, and this time with a totally original story. A heist movie/zombie movie mashup, Army sees a ragtag group of soldiers and mercenaries, led by Dave Bautista’s Scott Ward, heading into a walled-up Las Vegas that’s teeming with zombies to pull off one last heist. As critics have noted, it’s Snyder unfettered: full of gore, awesome soundtrack choices, plenty of slo-mo, and heart-on-your-sleeve, earnest emoting… even from the zombies.Ahead of the movie’s release on Netflix, Snyder spoke to Rotten Tomatoes about the “most fun” movie-making experience of his life, building a new kind of zombie lore (and getting audiences to root for “Team Zombie”), and his no-holds-barred plans to expand the Army of the Dead world with more films and a “very adult” animated series. (Warning: the below interview contains minor spoilers for Army of the Dead.)Joel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes: Congratulations on the movie, Zack, and congratulations on the surprise theatrical run. Why is this a good film for audiences to see on the biggest screen they possibly can – if it’s safe –&nbsp;right now?Zack Snyder: By the way, if that big screen happens to be in your living room, by all means [watch it there]. But being at the theater, it’s a fun movie to see. Listen, when I made the film, there was no vision of this movie being in a theater. I didn’t even care to ask. I was like, “No, I appreciate you, Netflix, saying yes to this idea, and so I will honor you and your platform by making a movie specifically for this world.” And it was Netflix that came to me and said, “Hey, is it cool if we release the movie on the big screen as well?” And I said, “Absolutely, that would be amazing.” And it’s worked out great. The movie plays really well on a giant screen. In a lot of ways, it’s a lot of movie on a big screen. We went bigger than we normally would because it was going to be this big [gestures a small TV size], so I was like we might as well just blow the doors off it since you’re going to watch it at home. So in the theater it plays awesome.(Photo by Clay Enos / © Netflix)Rotten Tomatoes: It does so from the moment it starts with that credits sequence. When the social media embargo lifted, and then we were reading the reviews, everyone was like: This is the biggest credits sequence I think I’ve ever seen, or at least the biggest Zack Snyder credit sequence. Why did you want to go so big and put so much into that montage – and how challenging was that to pull off?Snyder: It was pretty challenging. I will say though that, like anything, I wanted to make sure that this … Well, this was a movie about veterans. These are veterans. The old gunslingers. They go for one last mission. That was the movie, and it always was, but I wanted to tell the story of their journey and their war story in the title sequence. I just felt like it was important that we let you know in the title sequence that they had suffered trauma and they’d gone all the way into the heart of darkness with their journey in the zombie fall of Vegas.I also wanted to trick you a little bit with it, like the movie does. It’s a small metaphor for the actual experience of the movie. It looks like a lot of zombie fun and there’s a lot of hijinks, and then suddenly you find yourself caring about these guys. And there’s a lot of drama and there’s a lot of heartbreak. But then in the end, you realize that you’re in this “let’s do it again” kind of a world. That was something I wanted to express on a small scale in the title sequence.Rotten Tomatoes: I think the film really does that balance so well, between the spectacle and the gore, and then these emotional relationships, particularly between Dave [Bautista] and Ella [Purnell], and then also between Matthias [Schweighöfer] and Omari [Hardwick], which I absolutely loved. Why was it so important for you to home in on and really develop these strong bonds between certain characters?Snyder: That’s the “why” of the movie in a lot of ways – in the end you can go on a zombie romp, but what is the “why” of it? And I think that in the end, it’s those human relationships that make us care and make it important, and the characters you want to see live, and the ones that sacrifice, and the ones that you want to see not make it, you start rooting in all different directions. And I think that in the end this is the “why” of making a big movie and going on this big journey. It’s really a fun and exciting place to be if you care.(Photo by Clay Enos / © Netflix)Rotten Tomatoes: You went even further than that in some ways. There are certain zombies we come to care for!Snyder: Yes, it was important to me that [we cared about the zombies], if it was possible. I remember when we were talking about this at the early days, I was like, I want people to be Team Zombie at some point. I want there to be people that are like, “I really hope that Zeus makes it.” That’s what I want. Or him and his queen to start a new world somewhere. I think that would be amazing. And I just think that’s the rare thing in a zombie film: empathy for the zombies.Rotten Tomatoes: Yeah, because it’s a completely new spin. I mean we’ve had empathy for zombies, but generally because you see the previous character that was there and you know the relationship between the person who’s alive, but we hadn’t really seen society-forming, thinking zombies. And it’s almost a Planet of the Apes development here.Snyder: Yeah, I really love the Planet of the Apes reference because that’s what I was going for in a lot of ways. I love the idea that Zeus… he cries, frankly, in the movie. And I know it sounds like a joke when I say a zombie cries in this film, but I think when you see it in context that you don’t bat an eye. It’s just, like, of course he would. Who wouldn’t? And I think that even just the notion that… the switching of the thing where you go into that world thinking we’re just going to kill any zombie we see, but then you realize that in the end, the humans are double crossing, and they’re not honoring the deal, and all of that. I just think that’s super fun to wonder who’s the honorable one in the scenario.(Photo by Clay Enos / © Netflix)Rotten Tomatoes: It was really refreshing, and that all came from you, because, if I’m correct, this is your second project after Sucker Punch that’s entirely original as opposed to an adaptation. What’s the difference in the experience between adapting something that is beloved and trying to do that justice, and doing something where you have free rein and it’s all come from your own mind?Snyder: First, I mean just to say, Sucker Punch –&nbsp;and I loved the movie and it’s awesome – but it was one of those things we pitched as a hard R, crazy, R-rated movie. And the studio asked us to make a PG-13 and we were like okay, to do it, we’ll do it. And Army of the Dead is a movie where Netflix has been 100% with us. I go, “It’s an R-rated movie all the way,” and they were like, “Awesome, go for it.” I think it just allows the true original vision of the movie to keeps it integrity. And you can feel that when you watch the movie, that it’s singular. I think the singularity of it is the thing that makes it so you go into that world and you buy it at every turn.And when you’re dealing with something like the DCEU, which is such hyper-focused IP where the studio is doing a lot of the decisions out of playing defense with the idea, they’re constantly just trying to protect their back, it’s hard to score when you play defense. It’s just difficult. You can see it. A lot of the decisions feel like they’re made in a… I mean that’s the one thing about what I got to do with Justice League, finally it’s just like okay, just go and do it. And that was fun for me.(Photo by Clay Enos / © Netflix)Rotten Tomatoes: So, would you say this is one of the most free experiences you’ve had making a film?Snyder: Yeah, I would say for sure it was the most fun I’ve had making a movie. I mean pure fun every day, day in and day out. These actors, these scenarios –&nbsp;we knew it was crazy, and so it’s fun to do. When you’re having Dave Bautista run down across the tables in a casino firing a machine gun and zombies are diving all over the place, I mean, I’d say “cut” and I would literally be laughing, like, okay, this is ridiculously awesome. Or even just taking Garret [Dillahunt] and throwing him around on these wires, and that’s going to be a zombie shaking him to death…. It was pretty funny, but we didn’t not take it seriously or not try and make it at its highest level, but we still had the joyous child-like glee from the experience.Rotten Tomatoes: And I think the audience will share that feeling, because you watch that scene with Garret and that tiger and it’s just delightful in its gory way.Snyder: Yeah, I know. If you can’t have fun watching that in the movies, then you’ve lost touch of your inner gore child that is waiting to get out.Rotten Tomatoes: I want to talk to you about runtimes, because it’s a two-and-a-half hour zombie movie, and we’ve come off a four-hour Snyder cut, Zack Snyder’s Justice League. What do you say to people who think a popcorn movie needs to be two hours, that’s what an audience can handle, that’s what makes for good pacing, when you’re delivering these long movies that people are eating up?Snyder: I don’t know. I mean, the record doesn’t hold that. If you go look at the top box office movies of all time, Jim Cameron sure doesn’t make short movies, I’ll tell you that. You know what I’m saying? And Lord of the Rings is no matinée quickie and is better for it; the Dark Knight trilogy, they’re not short movies. And the movie’s as long as it is. I don’t think you can back into it that way. I mean yeah, you have a target, you have an area, two-and-a-half hours. Beyond that, sure, we’re constantly trimming. Was the first pass of Army of the Dead three hours, three-and-a-half hours? Probably. I was conscious of it. I was like, “Oh, it’d be good if it was just under two-and-a-half hours. That’d be good.”(Photo by Clay Enos / © Netflix)Rotten Tomatoes: And we’re actually getting more of this world, right?Snyder: There’s an animated series, a prequel. I’m directing two of the episodes of the animated series. Yeah, it’s fun. And I came up with the story with Shay [Hatten, co-screenwriter of Army of the Dead] and well, because Shay and I actually, we were ready to go if there was a sequel that anybody ever wanted, we know how to do it, and so the world of the animated series is directly related to what would be the world of the sequel. So I really had to very carefully plan out and construct the entire “what happens in that world” in the world of the animated series. And then the prequel, also Shay and I wrote the story for that. That’s another genre bender – Matthias [Schweighöfer] directed basically a romantic comedy heist movie. We constantly keep doing this genre mashing.Rotten Tomatoes: Can you give us a sense of what we can expect from the animated series?Snyder: In the animated series, we trace the origins of the zombie plague, not only where it came from, but then its actual origins and what is the “why” of it. And from a scale standpoint, it’s hilarious. It really is a crackup if you can imagine the kind of things that you could do in animation, where there’s no rules and nothing to stop you.Rotten Tomatoes: Also a hard R rating?Snyder: Oh God, yeah. It’s very adult animated series, yeah. Very adult.Army of the Dead is in theaters now and available on Netflix from Friday May 21, 2021.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Pixar, quibi, Dates, Arrowverse, Peacock, Extras, Network, Showtime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"zack-snyder-wants-to-tap-into-your-inner-gore-child-with-horror-heist-hybrid-army-of-the-dead"},{"id":"47611737419884","title":"Know Your Critic: Sharronda Williams, Founder of Pay or Wait","content":"Know Your Criticvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Know Your Critic: Sharronda Williams, Founder of Pay or WaitWilliams shares what she’s been watching in quarantine, a favorite movie from her childhood, and the film whose Rotten score keeps her up at night.by Sophie-Marie Prime | April 15, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Touchstone Pictures, Fox, and Marvel Studios)“Know Your Critic” is a column in which we interview Tomatometer-approved critics about their screening and reviewing habits, pet peeves, and personal favorites.In just the few years since she founded her multimedia platform Pay or Wait, Sharronda Williams has become a go-to source for her audiences. She’s interviewed major creatives from directors like Spike Lee to actors such as Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer. Her expertise and sharp wit shine brightest in her video reviews on YouTube, in which Williams always offers both nuance and a sense of humor.“For me, it’s very intentional that people see me, that I’m funny at times,” Williams said in an interview with Rotten Tomatoes. “I try to make people feel like they’re talking to themselves, I never want to make people feel as though, ‘I’m not smart enough to be a film critic,’ right?”Williams’ decision to appear on-camera is a reflection of her desire to offer visibility for Black women like herself, and to transparently represent her experience. No matter what she’s reviewing, she is aware of the many subjectivities at play: her own, the creatives’, and the audiences’.“Sometimes it is hard to let go of your experience as a Black person in this country, because you see the film in a totally different viewpoint,” Williams said.“When we’re talking about issues, especially that are still a sore subject in America’s history – when it’s confronting slavery, and confronting racism and how it still plagues this nation to this day – it’s very hard to make sure that you’re doing your job as a critic,” Williams said. “These are experiences that are lived that are witnessed day in and day out.”As Williams grows her audience, she has become – and hopes to remain – a voice for movie fans and up-and-coming critics alike.Sharronda Williams is the founder of Pay or Wait, a YouTube channel and an online publication centered on entertainment reviews and interviews. Find her on Twitter: @payorwait.What’s your favorite seat in a movie theater?I like to sit in the back, middle. I love being in the middle of the screen. I feel like I have all of the viewpoints I need to see. I also hate when people kick my seat, I hate to hear people chew in my ear. The only downfall to that being my favorite seat is, I can see everyone and their cellphones.You get to see people’s reactions, too. I love people-watching and seeing how the movie makes them feel. That’s why – even for press screenings, when they put you in the front – I really like sitting in the back, because I love watching the audience’s reaction as well.Does that ever play into how you review a film or how you discuss it?I love going to screenings for kids’ movies because I really love to be able to tell how it’s going to hold a child’s attention. I bring my god-children with me – they’re still getting into going to the movies.That and comic book movies, I love – I have to see it with an audience.I totally agree – comic book movie experiences are made by the audience.I literally still remember the audience’s reaction to the end of Endgame, when you hear Steve say, “Avengers, assemble!” And then when you hear Sam say, “On your left.” It’s just brings me back to that emotion of what was happening in the theater at that time. You can’t beat a theater experience, you really can’t.(Photo by Liam Daniel/Netflix)What has been your favorite thing to watch in quarantine this past year?The obvious is Bridgerton, because it gave me romance, it gave me entanglements, it gave me messy drama. It’s what I live for. It made me feel like I was in a whole relationship, I was totally invested.Did you binge the show, or do you avoid binge-watching?I actually watched Bridgerton a couple of months before it released and I was like, “Oh my gosh, this show is so good.” I was literally calling my colleagues like, “You need to go, you need to request Bridgerton. Do it right now. It’s going to be a hit, just thank me later.” So yeah, I binged the whole thing.I had to pause halfway through – I think it was the fourth episode – when the Duke… the whole scene in the garden. When he said he still wasn’t going to marry her, I lost it. I had to take a couple of hours of a break because I was so upset at him that I couldn’t even deal. I had to come back to it the next day.That scene infuriated me. I cannot stand when people know they could be happy and will not choose happiness.Yes, because it was his pride! I was like, “What are you doing?”When you are reviewing, do you go in cold?I do reviews on YouTube and trailer reactions are this huge thing. Every time a trailer comes out, they’re like, “Hey, can you do a trailer reaction?” And then I have to disappoint everyone and tell them that I don’t watch trailers. I like to go in completely blind.This started when Southpaw came out. I hadn’t seen any trailer, I just knew it was a boxing movie with Jake Gyllenhaal. That’s all I needed: Jake Gyllenhaal shirtless. Done, I’m there.So, I get into the movie and we’re watching it, and then Rachel McAdams‘&nbsp;character dies. I literally was the only one who gasped in the middle of the movie theater. My friend turned to me, she was like, “What is wrong with you?”I was like, “She just died!” And she was just like, “Girl, that was in the trailer!” And I was like, “See! I will never watch another trailer again after this, never.”What makes a “good” movie?It makes me feel something. I mean, that’s why we watch movies! We want to be excited. Sometimes we want to be sad or we want to be happy, we want to laugh.Movies that cause thoughts or discussion. Movies that promote change or a change within, that make you want to be a better person, make you analyze yourself as a person. Those movies that truly stick with you afterwards, and you’re still thinking about the next day, that you’re still having conversations with your friends about. I think those are such good movies, because it just truly shows the impact of a creative work.Was there a movie or a television series that you watched that made you want to become a critic?I can tell you one that made me understand the importance of being a Black critic. That was Detroit.When Detroit came out, it was really interesting because I would read reviews but I also watch YouTube videos. That’s what helped me solidify why I do what I do – and really, just seeing a lot of the people miss a lot of the historical things that someone growing up in the Black experience, that this is my life.When they show The Great Migration portrait – the famous illustration in Black culture. Growing up, everyone had this picture in their house. We’ve seen this on Black TV shows. I saw that a lot of non-Black critics, they didn’t understand what that illustration meant. Or, they didn’t understand the importance of how certain characters are portrayed, especially when we’re dealing with real events that have happened, that have shaped our country as a whole.I think it really helped me understand the importance of my voice, the importance of why we ask for diversity in film criticism. The beautiful journey of watching from different viewpoints, different experiences – how they’re really shaped, how you view films, how you criticize films. That was a movie that helped me to keep going, even in times when I felt like giving up – my perspective as a Black woman, why it’s so necessary and essential to film criticism.(Photo by Warner Bros./Courtesy Everett Collection)What are you most proud of in your career thus far?I remember the first time I got an email from Rotten Tomatoes. When I first started, I remember going to the website and looking at the qualifications and I’m like, “Child, I’m never going to get this. We’re going to put this on the back burner forever.” Being a part of Rotten Tomatoes, being able to say that when you see the Tomatometer on commercials or whatnot that, “Hey, my review counts towards that.”Most recently, I got my first pull quote for Judas and the Black Messiah. I remember I was asleep and I woke up and everyone was like, “Oh my goodness, I just saw your name on TV during SNL!” Having my brother call me as I try and drift off, “I just saw your name. I was watching Judas and the Black Messiah and then I watched this trailer afterwards where your name popped up.” I think that is when I was like, “Whoa, this is serious, this is real.” You know?Do you remember a time when you were watching something, a movie or a television series, where you saw a character that reflected your experience?Living Single was one of my first experiences. Before I got into film criticism, I used to want to be a lawyer in college. I remember growing up and watching Maxine Shaw on Living Single and I was like, “Oh my goodness, it’s a Black woman as a lawyer. And she lives by herself, and she has these friends, and she’s lives this great life.”What is the hardest review you’ve ever produced?The most recent one was Antebellum. It was really hard.I always want to make sure that I respect the role of creatives – that they took the time and the energy to put their art into the world for a lot of people to consume it and form their own opinions.It’s challenging as a Black critic – and I think a lot of people will agree whether they will publicly admit it or not – because we don’t get a lot of films or TV shows that center around the Black experience that star Black women. Because we don’t get so many, it becomes very hard because you understand the importance of seeing someone like Janelle Monáe on screen, a woman leading this film. That was a really hard review, critiquing a work that features a Black woman, that features an issue that is very close to me as someone who lives the Black experience each day – especially when you don’t necessarily connect with it.It’s hard, because personally you want to see more of this on screen and you don’t want to knock down someone’s ability to create. Especially because it’s so hard for Black people to be able to create in this industry, and to actually have their projects seen by the masses. But you also want to make sure that the stories that are being told, the stories that are portrayed, and these characters – who are my aunts, my uncles, my mother, my sister, my brother – you want to make sure that it is being done in a great light.Because in this world, what you see on TV, people take it as gospel… Unfortunately, that’s just the society we live in. What we see on TV, we basically say, “This is what Black people do, this is how they act.” If you see Black caricatures, that is how people see us. The situation makes it hard as a critic, especially a Black critic.(Photo by Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)What is your favorite movie from your childhood?I watched A League of Their Own so many times that if my mother came into the room she was like, “I can’t believe that you’re watching this movie again.” It was just – I loved it, I was fascinated, I didn’t know that there were female baseball players.Especially that scene where the Black woman catches the ball and throws it, and she has this mean arm. I loved that moment in the movie.Is there an actor or a director or a screenwriter whose work you always love? Someone who regardless what they make, you’re excited to watch it?Growing up, I always loved Denzel Washington. I remember after watching one of my favorite roles of his is Malcolm X. No matter how long the movie is, I watch him all the time.The most conflicted I’ve ever felt in a movie was Training Day. I’ve never necessarily hated Denzel so much in a movie, and I felt morally conflicted because I wanted this character to die so bad. But it’s Denzel playing him, so I can’t … I just remember watching that with my parents and I was like, “This is really causing me stress, like internal stress right now, that I really don’t like him in this movie.” But I mean, I think that speaks to his performance.Do you ever feel like actors get cast in roles that are completely awful and unlikable people, so people will empathize with them?Yes, that’s how I feel about him in Training Day. I mean, it’s such an iconic role! You know? “King Kong ain’t got nothing on me!” I mean it was just like, “Oh my goodness, why is he so good at a bad person? Why?! Why are you that good?”That’s my dream interview one day, to interview Denzel. I will pass out though, if they actually said, “Hey Sharronda, it’s time to interview him,” I’d probably pass out.(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)What is your favorite Rotten film or television series?Sister Act and Sister Act 2. It’s disgusting! It is troubling. Sometimes I cannot sleep at night, to think that Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, one of my favorite films growing up, is at a 19%! It is an injustice, it truly is.Yes! I feel that way about But I’m a Cheerleader. Like, “Did y’all miss the point? Did it sail over your heads? What?”Even Robin Hood: Men in Tights! That’s disrespectful, too. I could go on about this for days. But Sister Act 2, we’ve got to do something about that.What do you think is the biggest misconception about critics?I think part of it is that film critics hate every single thing. It’s weird because, in our industry, the negativity is what gets amplified outside of those who actually connect and love the art that comes out.For YouTubers, they don’t see us as critics because we don’t write. I think that’s really important. I’m an English major, I’ve written poetry that’s been published in books. I can write if I choose to write, you know? I think just understanding that what we do is just as important, it’s just another way that people consume criticism. And I think really just opening themselves up to the fact that the world is changing and how people consume things are changing.For me as a Black woman, it’s not easy for me to go get a staff job. To write for someone, it’s just an anomaly, honestly. It doesn’t happen very often and it’s too few and far between in the industry right now.For me, it’s important that we have avenues to build our own platforms that we can support ourselves off of, and to have that visibility. Because the visibility of a YouTuber is really important, especially in the Black community.You’ve mentioned before that your decision to appear on-camera for reviews was very intentional. Can you talk about that?My parents always took me to the movies since I was a little kid. I would have my mom drop me off in the theater by myself to spend the whole day there. I love watching films. But I never saw anyone who was like me, who was popular and made me feel like that was something that I could be – a film critic. I thought I could just be someone who always went to the theaters every weekend. It’s very important that you see people who look like you, that you see Black women who are doing this.There’s so many people that reach out like, “Oh my goodness, I want to be a film critic and never thought I could do it, then I saw your channel and I started my own.” I help people – people who message me or DM me, I help them – give them tips on how they can do it because I don’t want to be the only Black woman who does this. I don’t want to be the only Black face that you see on YouTube.So, it’s really important that we have these images of people who look like us, because they inspire the next generation. They inspire those who have been trying to do this for so long and just never had the courage to actually do it. And that’s why for me YouTube is such an intentional thing that I do, especially when you see the discussions all the time about how – as we look at staff writers for major publications – there’s not a lot of Black people, and especially on top of that, not a lot of Black women.Everyone’s perspective, as long as it’s done respectfully, is needed in criticism.(Photo by Universal International Pictures)What is your favorite classic film? And, you can define classic however you like – inside or outside the canon.There’s this movie my mother – my mother is such a character – if she felt like I wasn’t appreciating her as a mother, she would make me watch Imitation of Life. I think it was the 1959 version.I watched it so many times. She was like, “You see how she treated her mother?” She turned into a whole African queen. And I was like, “How many times do I have to watch this movie?”But that film is now ingrained into my DNA. That is a movie I will never forget, and mainly just my mother forcing me to watch it every time she felt like I was being a disrespectful child.Is there an under-the-radar director or screenwriter that you think more people should know about?Mike Gauyo (@blackboywrites). He was like an assistant on Claws, this show that I love, and also too, on this upcoming season of Insecure. He was actually on a writers staff for Ginny and Georgia. Some of his work is in TV, but I would love to see him be able to break through more doors.Who are three people that you think everyone should follow on Twitter?@Ryan_Ken_Acts on Twitter. He’s hilarious. He’s an actor, but he does parodies of movie stuff. He literally brightens up my day, because whatever I was thinking about a film he’s like spot on in his parody of it.I love Robert [Daniels] (@812filmreviews). Robert’s my fave. I love his spicy tweets. He’s also a great writer and it’s inspiring to watch Black critics excel the way that Robert has. I love that he uses his platform to uplift other voices and to also use his platform to fight for change, which really affects those spicy tweets.You know who I love? Joi Childs (@jumpedforjoi). I love watching her progression – we both worked corporate jobs and we’re film critics. To see her transition and see her working for Amazon – and seeing how she makes it a priority to uplift diverse voices, that she’s in a position of power and still continues to fight for that in a different arena – I think is really inspirational. … Joi’s one of those people that I just can’t wait to see what she’s doing 10 years from now, because I know she’s going to be a badass in whatever she’s doing.Just, I want us to get to a point where we uplift everyone. My goal in life is to have a platform so I can uplift those under-represented voices to provide more shine or light to people who are up and coming in the industry – whether it be actors, film makers, and writers. I think that is why we build our platform, that’s why we have an audience, to help usher in a new generation of people.Do you have any advice for critics who are still finding their voice?Just keep providing criticism. Your voice is going to change, how I view movies, how I reviewed movies is totally different from when I first started, to where I am now. And I think that as you get more access, and you’ll start to see that you have a bigger responsibility. … It’s such a huge thing to put your art out there, and there’s a respect that has to be had.I would just tell people to keep fighting, keep pushing. If there aren’t any lanes for you to succeed in, then create your own lane. And just always be true to yourself. Don’t change who you are, don’t try to sound like someone else. I always tell people, especially when they ask me how to become successful on YouTube, even though I don’t feel like I’ve found success yet myself: What viewpoint or what perspective are you giving that you’re currently not seeing?I started my channel because on YouTube I didn’t see Black people, especially Black women, who looked like me giving their thoughts on films and TV shows.That’s the important thing that everyone misses. I think everyone looks at who’s successful and, “I need to be just like them. I need to write like them. Why can’t I write like them? Why can’t I come up with these think pieces like everyone else?” I think that if you’re chasing someone else’s dream, you’re never going to realize your own, or even be able to live it.You have to always be true to yourself at all times. Just be you. There are going to be people who don’t like you. There are people who don’t like me – they don’t like my long nails, they don’t like how I talk – but I have to always be me. And there’s going to be people out there who enjoy you for who you are and the work and the viewpoint that you bring to the criticism.Sharronda Williams&nbsp;is the founder of&nbsp;Pay or Wait,&nbsp;a YouTube channel&nbsp;and&nbsp;an online publication&nbsp;centered on entertainment reviews and interviews.

This season – one unlike any we have seen in recent years – has had its share of upheaval over the past eight months. First came the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’s decision to push back the awards ceremony to April, and then several marquee titles vacated the 2020 calendar due to COVID-19 shutting down the theatrical box office. The ceremony&nbsp;itself will take place at satellite venues around the globe with the bulk of the show taking place outside at Los Angeles’ Union Station.Download Rotten Tomatoes’&nbsp;printable Oscar Ballot; cast your vote in our&nbsp;digital Oscar ballot.One result of all this change is that we have a host of tiles and performances that many audiences – and a not-insignificant&nbsp;number of AMPAS voters – have yet to screen.With all&nbsp;that in mind, we decided to break down some of the top categories in the final days of the season&nbsp;and give our odds on who’s most likely to be going home with some hardware come Oscar night. Up first we have the Actor categories, both Supporting and Lead.Disagree with our picks and odds? Have at us in the comments.BEST SUPPORTING ACTORLeslie Odom Jr.,&nbsp; 98% One Night in Miami (2020)The Role: Four famous friends – Jim Brown, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, and Cassius Clay – share a night in a hotel room in Miami and Hamilton‘s&nbsp;Leslie Odom Jr.&nbsp;is Oscar-nominated for his performance as Cooke. Odom Jr.’s talent is on full display as he transforms into the charismatic star who spends most of the film battling with the equally formidable Malcolm X. And no voter is going to forget his stirring rendition of the soul singer’s “A Change Is Gonna Come” at the closing of the film.The Odds:&nbsp;With one of the best lines of the film and an exclamation point of a closing number, Odom Jr. rises above the already&nbsp;impeccable&nbsp;ensemble. And though we think he has faded a bit under the blinding light of Daniel Kaluuya’s star power and sweep of the major awards so far for his work in Judas and the Black Messiah, the Tony-winner is still in the mix for a reasonable upset if there is one brewing.Paul Raci,&nbsp; 97% Sound of Metal (2020)(Photo by Amazon Studios)The Role:&nbsp;Joe, the leader of a home for troubled deaf youth, who gives shelter and education to Ruben (Riz Ahmed), a rock-metal drummer who recently lost his hearing.&nbsp;Joe is the mentor, patriarch, and a frank counselor&nbsp;who&nbsp;guides Ruben to accept this new diagnosis, which in turn allows him to find peace.The Odds:&nbsp;Not to knock his chances, but this year the journeyman character actor (check out our detailed breakdown of his career here) is poised to reap rich benefits from just being nommed. Just&nbsp;as with Robert Forster after his late-career Oscar nomination for Jackie Brown, we don’t think this is the last we will see from the 40-year acting veteran – but this time is not likely his year to take home gold.Sacha Baron Cohen,&nbsp; 89% The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020)(Photo by Netflix)The Role:&nbsp;Abbie Hoffman, one of the&nbsp;seven men charged with inciting a riot outside of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.&nbsp;Cohen relies on his natural comedic timing and biting political wit to bring authenticity and humor to one of the most recognizable men of the 1960s’ counter-culture movement.The Odds: The sole acting performance to stand out as awards-worthy amongst the likes of Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, Jeremy Strong, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Frank Langella in a film tailor-made for an awards voting body, many of whom most likely&nbsp;lived through the events of the narrative – that is a power plus. Coupled with the recent SAG ensemble win for the cast, and a second Oscar nomination for writing on the Borat sequel, and it’s hard to dismiss Cohen’s chances… but even he will likely be lapped by Kaluuya’s late surge.LaKeith Stanfield,&nbsp; 96% Judas and the Black Messiah (2021)The Role:&nbsp;William O’Neal, a petty thief turned FBI informant who befriends then betrays Fred Hampton, the Chairman of the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther party.&nbsp;As the “Judas” half of the title, the Get Out and Sorry to Bother You&nbsp;star wrings every ounce of tension and anxiety out of himself to embody the informant under deep cover but completely naive to who’s the real enemy.The Odds:&nbsp;When we made our original Oscar predictions, we placed Stanfield at a near-zero chance to make it&nbsp;to nominations morning – particularly as he was campaigning in the hotly contested Best Actor field – but lo and behold here he sits with a puzzling Best Supporting Actor nomination. So let’s just say it’s unlikely he will win. Stranger things have happened in Oscar’s 93 year history, though, and clearly we’ve been wrong on this one before.Daniel Kaluuya,&nbsp; 96% Judas and the Black Messiah (2021)The Role:&nbsp;Fred Hampton – one of most pivotal if not well-known names from the Black Civil Rights movement – the leader of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party who was assassinated by the Chicago Police following a raid orchestrated by FBI informant William O’Neal.The Odds:&nbsp;The role of a&nbsp;tragic true-life figure, whose story comes loaded with issues relevant to the current national conversation, would be&nbsp;enough to get anyone into the conversation – especially a former Best Actor nominee. But Kaluuya’s&nbsp;sweep of the BAFTA, Golden Globes, Critics Choice, and SAG awards make his win in this category foregone conclusion.&nbsp;His odds are even.BEST ACTORRiz Ahmed, 97% Sound of Metal (2020)The Role:&nbsp;Ruben, a metal drummer on tour with his girlfriend and living out of an RV, whose rapid-onset hearing loss threatens everything he holds dear. Playing a person grappling with a sudden diagnosis, Ahmed shines not only as he wrestles with the anger over his loss but also his obstinate and foolish&nbsp;railing against reality.The Odds:&nbsp;There is a growing push for Ahmed, who made history as the first British Pakistani to be nominated for Best Actor and one of only a handful of South-Asian actors to ever earn an acting nomination – but that will likely not have enough traction to combat the inevitability of the Best Actor frontrunner.Gary Oldman, 82% Mank (2020)The Role:&nbsp;Citizen Kane scribe&nbsp;Herman J. Mankiewicz, who battled his director and co-writer Orson Welles, Hollywood, the Hearst empire, and his own demons on his quest to pen what many argue is the greatest screenplay ever written.The Odds:&nbsp;After it took decades of Oscar-worthy work – and yes we include his work in The Professional and True Romance&nbsp;– for Oldman to get his first Oscar nomination, followed closely by his first win,&nbsp;we appreciate&nbsp;the actor getting quick and deserved praise for his&nbsp;performance in&nbsp;Mank.&nbsp;But sadly the film has little chance of taking home any Oscars outside of the craft awards (though Amanda Seyfried&nbsp;may&nbsp;cause an upset for Best Supporting Actress), despite Oldman’s typically great performance.Anthony Hopkins, 98% The Father (2021)The Role:&nbsp;The eponymous Father, an aging man suffering from&nbsp;Alzheimer’s who is reluctant to employ&nbsp;a full-time caretaker and who becomes increasingly confused, angry, and terrified as the faces and events around him become unrecognizable.The Odds:&nbsp;Since&nbsp;The Father‘s debut at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2020,&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins&nbsp;has been penciled in at the top of just about every Best Actor tip sheet by awards prognosticators, and he would have remained there if not for Chadwick Boseman. However, the Oscar winner’s recent BAFTA Best Actor win is nothing to dismiss lightly, so we place him still in the thick of things despite losing front-runner status.&nbsp;He’s a solid chance for an upset – if an upset is in the cards.Steven Yeun, 98% Minari (2020)The Role:&nbsp;Jacob, a Korean immigrant singularly focused on his quest to taste the “American Dream,” uproots his family and moves them from California to a tiny Arkansas farm. Saddled with a determination that borders on delusion, Jacob still remains disarming and empathetic in large part due to Steven Yeun‘s quiet charm.The Odds:&nbsp;Nothing would please us more than finding a way to give a tie to Yeun and the current Oscar favorite, but alas that is not possible. Still, as this is the first Oscar nomination for Yeun – who has been on Certified Fresh streak since his departure from The Walking Dead&nbsp;–&nbsp;we feel this is just a stop on what is likely to a long journey in awards contention.Chadwick Boseman,&nbsp; 98% Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020)(Photo by Netflix )The Role: Levee, the trumpeter in Ma Rainey’s band, who dreams of recording his own music and&nbsp;bristles at the control Ma&nbsp;commands over his artistry. In his last role to be released following his untimely death last year,&nbsp;Boseman gives the best performance of his career as&nbsp;a cocky and troubled musician.The Odds:&nbsp;There’s little chance of anyone topping Boseman this year. And while&nbsp;the win will be a fitting way to honor the&nbsp;the actor’s legacy, it will also&nbsp;be undeniably&nbsp;deserved given the spectacular work he did on screen in the film.

The studio’s latest feature, Luca, is arguably on that lower tier, according to critics — not among Pixar’s best but still better than most alternatives — hence the high Tomatometer score we’ve come to expect, even if there isn’t quite as much of the excitement we usually find in the reviews themselves. Some critics think that it’s too basic, while others believe its lack of complexity is a good thing. And some critics trust that there’s more to the movie than what’s on the surface and it requires repeat viewings to properly appreciate it. Fortunately for anyone hoping to find out, Luca can be watched over and over on Disney+ starting this Friday, June 18.Here’s what critics are saying about Pixar’s Luca:How does it compare to other Pixar movies?Luca leans far lighter in tone and effect, but it’s no less memorable.–&nbsp;Rob Hunter, Film School RejectsLuca&nbsp;is easily Pixar’s most intimate and laidback effort since&nbsp;Ratatouille.–&nbsp;Keith Watson, Slant MagazineThe last fifteen minutes of&nbsp;Luca&nbsp;might go down as one of the best endings Pixar has ever produced.–&nbsp;Ryan McQuade, Awards WatchThis might be Pixar’s most childlike and cartoony offering.–&nbsp;Brian Roan, The Film StageMore of The Good Dinosaur or Onward level for me, Luca doesn’t quite reach the potential that I have grown to expect from Pixar.–&nbsp;Christie Cronan, Raising WhasiansWhile some material may hit with younger audiences, Luca makes for Pixar’s least enchanting, least special film yet.–&nbsp;Robert Daniels, RogerEbert.com(Photo by Pixar)Is it just a simpler Pixar movie than we’re used to?Luca&nbsp;is nowhere near as complex or deep as other Pixar fare and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.– Doug Jamieson, The Jam ReportAll the more satisfying for its simplicity… the rare Pixar movie that doesn’t feel like it’s been thought to death.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireIt is rigorously unphilosophical in a way that proves to be its greatest strength.– Clarisse Loughrey, IndependentBy going back to basics, we get a real connection with these characters.– Ryan McQuade, Awards WatchLuca&nbsp;has the look and feel of a more disposable flick, but that’s just on the surface. Beneath, it has the beating heart of a classic family tale in the making.– Joey Magidson, Awards RadarLuca never quite rises beyond being adorable — and hey, these days, adorable is fine —there’s something that just isn’t there.– Moira MacDonald, Seattle TimesHow are the visuals?The real magic of&nbsp;Luca&nbsp;is its visuals… The richness of the settings in both realms is a constant source of pleasure.– David Rooney, Hollywood ReporterLooking like a hand-drawn fairy tale book come to animated life, Luca&nbsp;has a captivating visual style with every detail popping.– Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-TimesThe gorgeous animation of&nbsp;Luca… is unlike other Pixar movies you’ve seen.– Ian Sandwell, Digital SpyIt’s been a while since they’ve done anything visually distinct and felt vastly different from the rest of their fare.

But… [it] may just leave you in a puddle of tears.– Doug Jamieson, The Jam ReportYeah, it’s cliched to say “I got misty-eyed in a Pixar movie,” but damn by the way they invest you with the friendship, it’s difficult not to find yourself feeling all warm and fuzzy.– Rendy Jones, Rendy ReviewsHappy tears at how lovely it all is, fortunately, we’re not talking&nbsp;Toy Story 3&nbsp;or&nbsp;Inside Out&nbsp;trauma here.– Ian Sandwell, Digital SpyI watched twice and no Inside Out or Up equivalent eye watering… Luca misses the Pixar emotional pull for me.– Christie Cronan, Raising WhasiansAre the characters memorable?Giulia’s lovable father Massimo, who instantly goes into the all-time list for best animated dads.– Ian Sandwell, Digital SpyA translucent anglerfish who Sacha Baron Cohen turns into one of Pixar’s funniest characters in less than two minutes of screen time.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireAs always, the Pixar magicians create a wonderfully populated world: I particularly enjoyed the cat character, who stares fixedly as only cats can.– Moira MacDonald, Seattle Times(Photo by Pixar)How is the screenplay?With all of its wit and perfectly interwoven story threads and running gags, [the script] bears all the hallmarks of the best of Pixar’s story trust.– Brian Roan, The Film StageThe script… like all the best Pixar movies, laces touching life lessons and delicate helpings of sentiment into what’s essentially a caper.– David Rooney, Hollywood ReporterWhy do another narrative about a&nbsp;girl stuck in the middle of two best friends?… The primary story flows through the motions.– Robert Daniels, RogerEbert.comUnfortunately, there’s also an episodic, shaggy-dog quality to the plotting that undercuts&nbsp;Luca’s emotional beats.– Keith Watson, Slant MagazineAre its themes up for interpretation?This really is a metaphorical film. The sea monsters could be any of us who feel different. Maybe they’re a metaphor for the LGBTQ community.– Danielle Solzman, Solzy at the MoviesIt’s the kind of metaphor that could be applied to a hundred different situations, but there’s an inherently queer subtext bubbling beneath the surface.– Doug Jamieson, The Jam ReportVery relatable for anyone who is within the LGBTQ+ community… [and also] works for a universal audience who may not identify as LGBTQ+ but can relate to someone who is.– Ryan McQuade, Awards Watch[It] serves as a kind of all-purpose allegory, where audiences are free to narrow in on its queer subtext, its rebuke of xenophobia, or its triumph against any facet of small-mindedness.– Clarisse Loughrey, IndependentIts themes of coming-of-age resemble too much of Pixar’s existing catalog — and without a narrative that really makes these themes feel fresh.– Nicole Clark, IGN MoviesIt never settles on exactly what it wants to say… It never makes a cohesive, powerful point.– Germain Lussier, io9.comWho is Luca ultimately for?While Disney and Pixar’s Luca is fun for the whole family, there are some very important messages for children laced throughout the film.– Tessa Smith, Mama’s GeekyLuca&nbsp;is entertainment for all ages as its bright colors and fast-moving action will appeal to the kids while the humor and themes should speak to older viewers.– Rob Hunter, Film School RejectsWhile there are a few moments that may be a little tense for younger kids… I recommend Pixar’s Luca for kids as young as 5-6 years old.– Christie Cronan, Raising WhasiansWill it remind us of any other films?Luca is the closest that Pixar has ever come to capturing the ineffable spirit of a Studio Ghibli film.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireThe smooth, rounded character designs are something more akin to the stop-motion work of Aardman Animations.– Doug Jamieson, The Jam ReportThere are obvious shades of&nbsp;The Little Mermaid&nbsp;in this fairy tale-like story… but&nbsp;Luca&nbsp;plays like a deliberate inversion of that Disney classic.– Keith Watson, Slant MagazineLuca&nbsp;is The Little Mermaid without the heart, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs without the laughs.– Roger Moore, Movie Nation(Photo by Pixar)Is it rewatchable?Expect to visit this destination more than once.– Rob Hunter, Film School RejectsSince it’s so dense and layered, my guess is it’ll only improve, solidify and blossom with multiple viewings… I do want to watch it again.– Germain Lussier, io9.comIt’s also so fabulously summery that you shouldn’t be surprised if you return to it over and over for that sunny feeling.– Deirdre Molumby, entertainment.ieWill&nbsp;Luca leave us hopeful for Pixar’s future?Luca&nbsp;should be the model going forward for Pixar, with character driving entertaining stories instead of big concepts that fail to execute and leave you feeling hollow by the end (looking at you&nbsp;Soul).– Ryan McQuade, Awards Watch[It] hopefully anticipates how the monolithic animation house will continue to create more intimate fare now that it can use Disney+ as a safety net.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireLuca&nbsp;releases in theaters and streams on Disney+ on June 18, 2021.On an Apple device?

Case in point: You’re the Worst star Aya Cash joins the second season as Stormfront, a character who in the comics is described as a male neo-Nazi.Executive producer and showrunner Eric Kripke&nbsp;(Supernatural) told journalists that this change was two-fold: The first, he said is because they wanted to create an antagonist to Anthony Starr’s villain, Homelander, and that “his worst nightmare would be a strong woman who wasn’t afraid of him and proceeded to steal his spotlight. I think that would hurt him way more than if it were a male character, because he has a gaping hole of insecurity.”The second was more of a commentary on modern society.“Stormfront … has certain hateful ideologies,” Kripke said. “And the truth is there’s a lot of hate and negative thought these days, if you look online, that is packaged in really slick social media, attractive ways. And, you know, it’s not like old dudes with crewcuts in the 1960s news reels anymore. It’s a very real and slick and charming people that are trying to — young people who are trying to hook in a new generation, and we sort of wanted to reflect how insidious that is.”Cash said she trained for two months for the part.The Boys returns to Amazon Prime Video on September 4.More from Amazon this week:Amazon Prime Video debuted the official trailer for Mangrove, one of five films featured in Small Axe, the anthology series from Academy Award–, BAFTA-, and Golden Globe–winning filmmaker Steve McQueen (Hunger, 12 Years A Slave).Amazon Studios announced that it has ordered a pickup of the new hour-long series A League of Their Own, from Sony Pictures Television, with executive producers and co-creators Abbi Jacobson (Broad City), who also stars, and Will Graham (Mozart in the Jungle).Lovecraft Country&nbsp;Tackles Supernatural Demons and Real-World EvilLovecraft Country, creator Misha Green’s upcoming adaptation of the Matt Ruff horror novel, has plenty to show in the way of blood-thirsty demons and sci-fi beings. Out August 16, it also shows evil that is all too real.“I think that the monsters are a metaphor for the racism that’s kind of always been through America and even globally,” Green told journalists of her series that’s set during the Jim Crow era. “And I think that, for me, genre works best when it is the metaphor on top of the real-life emotions that you explore in the real-life problems. And I think that that was one of the things that was exciting to me about Matt Ruff’s book, is that he blended that very well, and we wanted to really honor that as we did the TV series.”Jurnee Smollett, who plays female lead Leti Dandridge in the show, added that “the story is so ancestral.”“Our heroes essentially are going on a quest to bring down white supremacy,” she said. “And we are still on that quest today in 2020 as Black Americans. Because racism is such a demonic spirit, you know, it’s something that we are still fighting off.”Like Green’s previous series, WGN’s Underground, the show also makes use of popular music and culture, be it a Cardi B song or the theme song to The Jeffersons. Green says she likes to use “modern music to bridge time; to take kind of a period piece off the wall [so that] it’s not a portrait anymore that you’re stepping into.”In other WarnerMedia news:The first trailer for Ridley Scott’s U.S. TV directing debut&nbsp;Raised By Wolves&nbsp;also premiered this week.&nbsp;The series centers on two androids tasked with raising human children&nbsp;on a mysterious virgin planet.Trailers for&nbsp;The Third Day limited series starring Jude Law and Emily Watson, and socially-distanced food program Selena + Chef, hosted by Selena Gomez, and a new teaser for The Undoing, starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant, were also released.WarnerMedia is bringing the British game show reboot of The Cube stateside with a series order, executive produced and hosted by NBA legend Dwyane Wade.Ava DuVernay will executive produce and narrate One Perfect Shot, an HBO Max documentary series that will chronicle the most memorable cinematic moments of film auteurs.&nbsp;In the series, inspired by a popular Twitter account of the same name,&nbsp;each episode&nbsp;spotlights one acclaimed director, who will use visual tools to pull back the curtain on their most iconic shots. Using state-of-the-art technology, the directors will literally enter each shot, walking through the scene in 360 moments that allow viewers to join an immersive exploration of moviemaking.Gritty&nbsp;Gangs Of London Takes a Cue from the GreatsComing to AMC+, the streaming service associated with AMC Networks, is the bloody, violent (or is it bloody violent?) British crime drama Gangs Of London. Co-created by Gareth Evans — who is best known for The Raid action movies — and Matt Flannery, it tells the story of feuding international crime families. And if that makes you think of a certain group of New Jersey hustlers, you’re not alone.“I think all crime television and film will have had something of a sort of influence on us,” Evans told journalists. “I tend to take more from Asian cinema, quite honest … But for sure, I mean like you know, we’re all&nbsp;fans of The Sopranos, we’re all fans of Peaky Blinders, we’re all fans of the workspace of Scorsese or Coppola. We consume crime films, we consume everything that comes our way. So naturally, I think, when you make it something that fits within this genre, within this world, there will be influences.”On October 1, the first three episodes of Gangs of London will hit AMC+,&nbsp;the company’s new premium subscription bundle available on Comcast and Dish Network/Sling, with additional episodes dropping weekly after that. The show will air on AMC next year.More AMC Networks news and info:Fall 2020 and winter 2021 premiere datesSoulmates, AMC’s episodic anthology series, premieres Monday, October 5 at 10 p.m. ET/9 p.m. CT and has been renewed for a second seasonthe four-part limited series The Salisbury Poisonings, which will initially premiere on AMC+, the company’s new premium subscription bundle available on Comcast and Dish Network/Sling on Thursday, October 1&nbsp;(debuts on AMC early next year)(Photo by Alex Telfer/BBC STUDIOS/BBCA)premiering in January 2021 on BBC America, the all-new original series The Watch&nbsp;(pictured) inspired by many&nbsp;of Sir Terry Pratchett’s famous “Discworld” creations, including the captain of The City Watch, Sam Vimes, played by Game Of Thrones’&nbsp;Richard Dormer; “The comedic yet&nbsp;thrilling series pits trolls, werewolves, wizards and other improbable heroes against an evil plot to&nbsp;resurrect a great dragon which would lead to the destruction of life as they know it.”animated special Doctor Who: The Faceless Ones&nbsp;uses archived audio and new animation to reconstruct the fourth season of Doctor Who, which&nbsp;starred&nbsp;Patrick Troughton and was&nbsp;missing four episodes in the BBC film archives;&nbsp;premieres Wednesday, October 7 at 8 p.m. ET/7&nbsp;p.m. CT and Thursday, October 8 at 8 p.m. ET/7&nbsp;p.m. CT(For more announced dates visit Rotten Tomatoes’ “TV Premiere Dates” calendar.)AMC Networks has inked true crime development deals with Mona Chalabi (The Fix, Vagina Dispatches), Naomi Ekperigin (Broad City, Couples Therapy), Cameron Esposito (Queery, Take My Wife), and Jena Friedman (The Daily Show, Soft Focus).Casting for AMC’s new series Pantheon,&nbsp;a first-ever animated primetime drama; Daniel Dae Kim, Katie Chang, Paul Dano, Rosemarie DeWitt, Aaron Eckhart,&nbsp;Taylor Schilling, Ron Livingston, Chris Diamantopoulos, Raza Jaffrey, and Scoot McNairy lead the cast.Ratched&nbsp;Star Says Series Tells a Noir Tale in TechnicolorRatched, the flashy Ryan Murphy-produced prequel to One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, premieres September 18 on Netflix. It stars Sarah Paulson as the infamous castrating nurse made famous by Louise Fletcher in the Milos Forman movie.“I thought about Louise Fletcher every day that we were shooting it,” Paulson said during the Ratched panel, “and I hope that in the coming season there will be some Louise Fletcher.”Whether that’s a tease to some stunt casting (and Murphy does love to stunt cast), audiences should know that there are other differences between this production and the 1975 movie (or Ken Kesey’s novel). Filming took place in Big Sur instead of Oregon, and the series is set in 1947 in Lucia, California. It also pays a good deal of homage to Alfred Hitchcock films.“I think there is something about the moment; just immediately after World War II [when] so much economic hope and horizons being so wide for America at that point,” said Cynthia Nixon, who co-stars in the series as the politically savvy Gwendolyn Briggs. “I watched the series with my 17-year-old son, and he said one of the things that he loved the most about it was it was so frightening and creepy, but … it was sort of the antithesis of film noir. It wasn’t shadows. It wasn’t black and white. It was Technicolor.”More from Netflix this week:&nbsp;(Photo by Kerry Brown/Netflix)The streamer released a first-look at Rebecca, based on Daphne du Maurier’s beloved 1938 gothic novel and starring&nbsp;Lily James, Armie Hammer, Kristin Scott Thomas, Keeley Hawes, Ann Dowd, Sam Riley, Tom Goodman-Hill, Mark Lewis Jones, John Hollingworth, and Bill Paterson. In it, “a young&nbsp;newlywed arrives at her husband’s imposing family estate on a windswept English coast and finds herself battling the shadow of his first wife Rebecca, whose legacy lives on in the house long after her death.”Netflix also&nbsp;dropped trailers from animated series Hoops; reality show&nbsp;DeMarcus Family Rules, featuring the family of Rascal Flatts’ Jay DeMarcus; and a tease&nbsp;announcing the 2021 premiere of director Guillermo del Toro’s Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans, the final installment in Tales of Arcadia animated film trilogy.Woke&nbsp;Gives a Voice to Black&nbsp;NerdsHulu’s new dramedy Woke is based loosely on the life of cartoonist Keith Knight, who co-created the series. Premiering September 9, it stars New Girl’s Lamorne Morris as a rising artist in San Francisco who, after a traumatizing event, begins to see the injustice of the world.To hear Knight tell it, the show might also give a voice to Black people who may have trouble fitting in the white male–dominated geek culture.“The idea that alternative culture is white culture, I think that is just a mirage,” Knight tells journalists. “I think the true punk culture, the true rock culture, the true — American culture is Black culture … And if you even scrape the surface of the history of this country, you will see that Black people have had a part in everything, not just music.”An example? Knight, who is a hockey fan, says “I just found out that like, modern hockey was like — hockey transformed by the grandkids of slaves that emigrated up to Canada.”More Hulu news:The company also released a trailer for the upcoming season of Pen15.Hulu announced season 2 renewals for Love, Victor and Taste The Nation with Padma Lakshmi (see Rotten Tomatoes’ “Renewed and Cancelled”).Girl From Plainville, starring Elle Fanning (who also stars in Hulu’s The Great), and docuseries The Next Thing You Eat from James Beard Award–winning chef David Chang and Academy Award–winning documentary filmmaker Morgan Neville received straight-to-series orders.Selena Gomez has joined as star and executive producer of the upcoming Hulu Original comedy Only Murders in the Building alongside Steve Martin and Martin Short.Hulu also announced fall premiere dates for Steven Spielberg–executive produced Animaniacs, upcoming drama series No Man’s Land, Hulu Original documentary I AM GRETA, food series Eater’s Guide to the World, and horror anthology series Monsterland&nbsp;(see Rotten Tomatoes’ “Premiere Dates” calendar).Vindication for Pepe the Frog?Documentary Feels Good Man&nbsp;looks at the how cartoonist Matt Furie’s drawing of a smiling green frog unintentionally became a symbol for hate on the Internet.“This is something that has never happened before,” director Arthur Jones told journalists. “The Anti-Defamation League never has declared a meme a hate symbol before. It has never declared a copyrighted character a hate symbol before.”He says it was “a process” for Furie, who participated in the film, “to figure out how to handle this. He tried to handle that via his artistic community first. Then he tried to find a set of lawyers to collaborate with to enforce the copyright in a way that he felt was right for him. While he’s doing this, he’s an artist; he’s starting a family — there’s a lot of stuff going on.”Feels Good Man will air on October 19&nbsp;as part of PBS’ Independent Lens series.Coming to You from the Bat Cave …(Photo by National Geographic)Journalists caught glimpses of lots of celebrities’ houses through this all-virtual press tour. But only one panel&nbsp;streamed from inside a bat cave: bat scientist Kendra Phelps and epidemiologist Chris Golden introduced us to some new friends while speaking on the panel for National Geographic’s upcoming documentary, Virus Hunters.Airing November 1 to be a companion piece to that month’s issue of the magazine, the special will tell “the stories of those heroic experts on the frontlines who are racing to identify the chain of events that could cause the next global pandemic,” said&nbsp;Nat Geo Senior Vice President of Communications Chris Albert, who introduced the panel.“Virus Hunters will aim to offer solutions, and some of those could include the work that Kendra and Jim [Desmond, a fellow panelist and a wildlife veterinarian] are doing where there is monitoring and surveillance of what is actually unfolding naturally within ecosystems,” Golden said. “I think it will beg the question of further policy- and decision-making that would lean on us to really view conservation as an important tool for public-health interventions.”","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"FX, news, TV, Country, Adult, visit","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"tca-roundup-the-boys-woke-lovecraft-country-ratched-more"},{"id":"47611733430378","title":"Who’s Going to Win Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress at the 2021 Oscars?","content":"Trophy Talkvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Who's Going to Win Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress at the 2021 Oscars?Awards expert Jacqueline Coley breaks down a tight three-way race for one award and a potential upset in another.by Jacqueline Coley | April 20, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by © Focus Features)After eight months of upheaval and uncertainty, an awards season unlike any we have seen in recent memory is finally — thankfully — entering its final days. We watched as several marquee titles vacated the 2020 calendar due to COVID-19, effectively shutting down the theatrical box office, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences pushed back its awards ceremony to April.&nbsp;The ceremony&nbsp;itself will take place at satellite venues worldwide, with the bulk of the show taking place outdoors at Los Angeles’ Union Station.Download Rotten Tomatoes’&nbsp;printable Oscar Ballot; cast your vote in our&nbsp;digital Oscar ballot.One result of all this change is that we have a host of titles and performances that many audiences – and a not-insignificant&nbsp;number of AMPAS voters – have yet to screen.With all&nbsp;that in mind, we decided to break down some of the top categories in the final days of the season&nbsp;and give our odds on who’s most likely to be going home with some hardware come Oscar night. Following our first list breaking down all the Actor categories, both Supporting and Lead, we&nbsp;look at the female performances of Oscars 2021, again in both the Lead and Supporting categories.Disagree with our picks and odds? Have at us in the comments.BEST&nbsp;ACTRESSViola Davis 98% Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020)The Role:&nbsp;Ma Rainey, the Mother of the Blues and leader of her band. The groundbreaking musician and LGBTQ icon was once dubbed the ugliest woman in show business, and with the aid of false teeth, horsehair wigs, elaborate gowns, and a fat suit, Oscar winner Viola Davis gave life to the woman whose voice would have hundreds queuing up for hours just hear her croon or catch a glimpse of her on stage. Davis embodied not just Rainey’s presence on stage but also her steadfast determination not to allow anyone to diminish or dismiss her worth.The Odds:&nbsp;Currently,&nbsp;there isn’t a clear frontrunner for Best Actress. Andra Day won the Golden Globe, Carey Mulligan took home the Critics Choice, and Frances McDormand won the BAFTA, but we are giving Viola Davis’ win at the SAG Awards the most weight and&nbsp;believe she will be our likely winner. This is fitting as her pedigree and previous Oscar nomination warrant it, and her only win was for a Supporting Role; she is more than overdue to win for a lead turn.Andra Day 56% The United States vs. Billie Holiday (2021)(Photo by Takashi Seida/©Hulu)The Role:&nbsp;Legendary singer Billie Holiday, whose career and battles with addiction and — as the title suggests — the U.S. government form the basis of the second big-screen narrative feature about her life.&nbsp;The portrayal comes courtesy of Grammy Award-winning songstress Andra Day, whose natural vocal talent and physical commitment to the role — which included extensive acting classes and a 40-lb. weight loss — transformed her into Holiday at her prime.The Odds:&nbsp;Captivating and dynamic performances, particularly by female performers, are often able to rise above a lackluster film. Last year, Renee Zellweger snagged a second Oscar for a film many critics&nbsp;considered well done but not remarkable.&nbsp;The United States vs. Billie Holiday, however, is not&nbsp;Judy. Although&nbsp;Day is outstanding, the film’s pedestrian narrative takes her firmly out of contention to win among the likes of Frances McDormand, Viola Davis, and Carey Mulligan — all of whom have been previously nominated, with Davis and McMcDormand both having at least one Oscar at home.Vanessa Kirby 75% Pieces of a Woman (2020)(Photo by Benjamin Loeb/Netflix)The Role:&nbsp;A young female executive in the final hours of her first pregnancy suffers a sudden loss when her child does not survive the at-home birth. Documented in a visceral and unbroken opening 20-minute scene, the film’s central tragedy finds Vanessa Kirby channeling intense&nbsp;grief and numb detachment to give a&nbsp;true-to-life&nbsp;portrayal of a woman trying to piece herself back together while her well-meaning family tries and fails to help her along.The Odds:&nbsp;After a win at the Venice International Film Festival for Best Actress,&nbsp;Kirby was poised for a deep run, but troubling headlines about her co-star pushed the film to the lower rung of contention, and Kirby has been mostly absent from virtual campaigning this year. We have to assume this was by design. Such an abrupt&nbsp;disappearance from the circuit is assumed to be because everyone involved —&nbsp;including Netflix —&nbsp;agreed this was not the year for Kirby, who will likely be back soon enough with award-worthy work.Frances McDormand 94% Nomadland (2021)The Role:&nbsp;Fern, an aging widow who chooses to hit the road&nbsp;as a #VanLife nomad after the financial crisis of 2008 and&nbsp;finds peace in isolated communities&nbsp;with other older Americans facing similar hardships.&nbsp;Frances McDormand disappears into the role of Fern, who discovers a new strength and sense of self as she&nbsp;travels the open roads of the American West.The Odds:&nbsp;The biggest knock that has been leveled against McDormand’s performance is that Fern is a difficult character to embrace, as she spends most of the film distancing herself from human connection. But in this painfully authentic look at how people deal with tragedy, we find a side of the Oscar-winning actress we haven’t often seen on screen: unbridled vulnerability. If the next knock is that she already has two Oscars, odds are she is still very much in the thick of it, and a recent BAFTA win makes this more of a possibility than it appears at first blush.Carey Mulligan 90% Promising Young Woman (2020)(Photo by Merie Weismiller Wallace/©Focus Features)The Role:&nbsp;Cassie, an avenging angel haunted by her past who brings justice to “Nice Guys” who prey on drunken women. Carey Mulligan&nbsp;embodies&nbsp;this delicious anti-hero for the #MeToo era, a vision of chaotic good in a candy-coated and hilariously macabre tale of a grief-stricken woman out for revenge.The Odds:&nbsp;In what ultimately amounts to a three-way race in the Best Actress cateogory, Mulligan is&nbsp;essentially the dark horse in the running, as most of the heat for&nbsp;Promising Young Woman is radiating from writer/director Emerald Fennell (who has more than a fighting chance to upset Aaron Sorkin and The Trial of the Chicago 7 for Best Original Screenplay).&nbsp;The chances of Mulligan coming out on top are less likely, but only by a slim margin.BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESSMaria Bakalova 85% Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm (2020)(Photo by Amazon Studios)The Role:&nbsp;The guileless and ever ready-to-please but often maligned daughter in Sacha Baron Cohen’s&nbsp;Borat&nbsp;sequel. Maria Bakalova’s ugly duckling transformation and ability to match Cohen beat for beat, staying in character for hours on end, are unquestionably Oscar-worthy feats, though some of the outrageous stunts she had to pull should&nbsp;win some kind of award for sheer commitment.The Odds:&nbsp;After nearly sweeping the critic’s groups a few weeks ago, Maria Bakalova was the odds-on favorite, but she faded a bit with losses at the BAFTAs and Golden Globes, and we while we hope to see more from the Bulgarian starlet, her meme-ability is likely the biggest prize she will take from this season.Glenn Close 26% Hillbilly Elegy (2020)The Role:&nbsp;The wise and caring grandmother who plays adoptive mother to JD Vance during his formative years growing up in Appalachia while his mother, played by Amy Adams, struggles with bad men and addiction.The Odds:&nbsp;We&nbsp;love Glenn Close and are desperate for the 8-time nominee finally to win, but&nbsp;with a Razzie nomination for the same role, we can’t see her taking the Supporting Actress prize this year for, let’s say, not her best outing, at least&nbsp;according to the critics. A legacy win for her could also knock out&nbsp;Minari’s&nbsp;Yuh-Jung Youn, a five-decade&nbsp;veteran of Korean cinema who is just as deserving.Olivia Colman 98% The Father (2021)(Photo by ©Sony Pictures Classics)The Role:&nbsp;The adult daughter of Anthony Hopkins’s eponymous father, who suffers from Alzheimer’s.The Odds:&nbsp;Many had Glenn Close pegged to win the year that Olivia Colman took home the Best Actress prize for The Favourite, but alas, it was not in the cards for Close that year. The&nbsp;same thing could happen in 2021, as The Father has emerged late as an AMPAS — yup, we’re gonna say it — favourite, but with many not having seen the film, and with most of the heat on Hopkins and the screenplay, Colman’s odds are likely lower.&nbsp;Of course, we’ve been wrong about&nbsp;that before.Amanda Seyfried 82% Mank (2020)(Photo by Courtesy of Netflix)The Role:&nbsp;Marion Davies, rumored Citizen Kane subject William Randolph Hearst’s muse and mistress. The clever woman who was at times the only one truly working behind the scenes in Hollywood on behalf of the notorious newspaper publisher was given life and her just due by Amanda Seyfried. The First Reformed&nbsp;star also hid her pregnancy under the period costumes, never giving away her secret — just like the real-life woman she was playing on screen.The Odds:&nbsp;Someone online recently stated that, had Mank been titled Marion and centered on the sultry, scheming mistress of William Randolph Hearst, the film would have swept every category. As it is, Mank&nbsp;is unlikely to win outside of the craft prizes, which is a shame, as Seyfried does the best work of her career here — well, her best work since Mean Girls,&nbsp;anyway.Yuh-Jung Youn 98% Minari (2020)(Photo by ©A24)The Role:&nbsp;Soon-ja,&nbsp;an&nbsp;unconventional and hilarious grandmother based on writer/director Lee Issac Chung’s&nbsp;real-life grandmother, who preferred playing cards and cracking jokes over baking cookies.The Odds:&nbsp;If a win at the SAGs, BAFTAs, and our feature on her career weren’t enough to convince you that Yuh-Jung Youn could win the Best Supporting Actress prize, her pedigree and incredible performance add plenty more. Still, for us, her viral BAFTA acceptance speech during which she jokingly called the Brits “snobbish” is the cherry on top of her awards momentum, giving her just enough to stand above her peers, as many will&nbsp;vote just to see what she says next — at least, that’s what we would do, given the chance.The&nbsp;93rd Academy Awards&nbsp;ceremony&nbsp;will be broadcast at 5 pm PST/8 pm EST on April 24, 2021, on ABC.&nbsp;Download Rotten Tomatoes’&nbsp;printable Oscar Ballot; cast your vote in our&nbsp;digital Oscar ballot.On an Apple device?

As the home to Hereditary, The Babadook, Get Out, and The Blair Witch Project, the Sundance Midnight program has a bit of a reputation, leaving this year’s selection with some pretty big shoes to fill.This year, genre spread to other sections of the programming, as fans needn’t have stayed up late at the Park City Library to catch some disturbing — or just plain weird — movies. No matter what your favorite genre is, you were bound to find something up your alley, from unusual documentaries to scary movies to fantastical comedies. And the good news is that distributors and streaming services are likely to snatch them up and make them available to you soon, with some of them already on the way.With expectations high, the question of what will be this year’s Hereditary-style hit is constantly brought up. We checked out the films competing to become this year’s big breakout hit, and rounded up what the critics were saying, so you can begin preparing your watchlists of what Sundance films are most likely to make a big impression once they get released.His House (2020)  100%(Photo by Aidan Monaghan courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: NetflixRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDNetflix’s big acquisition at Sundance is this tale of horror both supernatural and human. His House tells the story of a refugee couple who flee the horrors of the South Sudan civil war and come to England to start a new life. What they find is something that doesn’t want them there, with the very walls of the house exuding a sinister vibe. What makes the film truly special is how it balances the supernatural horrors of a haunted house movie with a poignant and equally devastating immigration story of survivor’s guilt. As Benjamin Lee wrote for The Guardian, “The haunting that takes place is one that’s tied to something that feels real.”&nbsp;Netflix will release His House some time later this year,&nbsp;and once it does, you can expect a movie “that will make audiences scream, all while getting people to empathize with a refugee couple’s story by way of a haunted apartment,”&nbsp;as RogerEbert.com’s Nick Allen puts it.Save Yourselves! (2020)  89%(Photo by Matt Clegg courtesy of Sundance Institute)Release Date:&nbsp;TBDWe are all obsessed with our phones; there’s no denying that. But what happens if we try to distance ourselves from the internet for a short time? According to Save Yourselves!, you may miss an alien invasion. Su (Sunita Mani) and Jack (John Paul Reynolds) are a hip Millennial couple, ruled by the technology at their disposal. When Su suggests they get away without technology in order to cleanse themselves during a life-reaffirming week, they find themselves having to fight off adorable poof-like aliens that remind us of a cuter version of Critters, as the rest of the world is already under attack.&nbsp;Rachel Wagner from Rachel Reviews writes that the film “is not only a very funny look at modern Millennial life but a sweet romance of a couple who become stronger through facing off with aliens.” Save Yourselves!&nbsp;is currently looking for distribution.Relic (2020)  92%(Photo by Jackson Finter courtesy of Sundance Institute)Release Date:&nbsp;TBDThe best horror often manages to be both a terrifying piece of entertainment&nbsp;and a poignant commentary on our reality. A remarkable debut by Natalie Erika James, Relic turns the haunted house story on its head, using the horror genre to tell an emotional story of dementia. Australian stage legend Robyn Nevin gives a terrifying yet emotionally devastating performance as a woman whose mind and body is slowly failing her,&nbsp;while a strange and eerie presence haunts her home. “Like Mike Flanagan before her”, writes Film School Rejects’ Rob Hunter, “Natalie Erika James flawlessly blends terrifying horror with the ache of humanity.” Rest assured, when Relic finally gets released, it will make you scream before it pulls on your heart strings.Run Sweetheart Run (2020)  73%(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: BlumhouseRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDBlumhouse returns to Sundance with its second “Sweetheart”-titled movie in&nbsp;Run Sweetheart Run. Like last year’s Sweetheart, this movie finds a young woman having to go toe-to-toe with an inhuman monster, as we follow Ella Balinska’s Cherie&nbsp;on her first date in a while. The problem is that her date turns out less than stellar, and she is forced to run through the streets of Los Angeles for an entire night to escape the blood-loving monster she mistook for a chance at romance. Though critics note that the metaphors are thinly-veiled at best, Bloody Disgusting’s Meagan Navarro writes&nbsp;that “Run Sweetheart Run makes for an entertaining and cheeky trip centered around woman’s curse.”Bad Hair (2020)  62%(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Release Date:&nbsp;TBDA social thriller starring a killer weave, Bad Hair is a campy throwback to ’80s horror B-movies with a whole lot on its mind. Writer-director Justin Simien returns to Sundance with a film about the importance of and controversy surrounding hair in the Black community, focusing on a lowly assistant at a TV show who gets a new hairstyle that helps her move up in her career – with some deadly, bloodthirsty consequences. Writing for That Shelf, Victor Stiff explains that the film&nbsp;“is a delightful horror dramedy that interrogates black women’s struggle to be true to themselves in the face of a system hellbent on snuffing out their blackness.” Bad Hair is looking for distribution.Possessor: Uncut (2020)  93%(Photo by Karim Hussain courtesy of Sundance Institute)Release Date:&nbsp;TBDPlaying like a horror version of Inception, Brandon Cronenberg&nbsp;(yes, son of David) takes us on a disturbing, bloody nightmare that’s unlike anything you’ve seen before. The film stars Andrea Riseborough as a contract killer whose consciousness gets implanted into others so she can control them into committing murders for hire — that is, until she finds herself struggling to control a particularly difficult body. This is a movie that’s not for the faint of heart, as Slashfilm’s Chris Evangelista writes: “This isn’t a work designed to thrill and entertain. Instead, it’s meticulously crafted to horrify. The violence on display here is graphic to the extreme, yet it never feels cartoonish.” While the violence and blood may be too much for some viewers, critics agree that this film is a unique experience worth seeing; as Rob Hunter writes for Film School Rejects,&nbsp;Possessor “is fantastically and cruelly unforgettable.” Keep an eye out for Possessor as it looks for distribution.Into the Deep (2020)  100%(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: NetflixRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDThe rare documentary to play at the midnight slot, this bone-chilling film started as an homage to Danish amateur inventor Peter Madsen before turning into an exploration of evil when Madsen murdered and dismembered Swedish journalist Kim Wall during the time the doc was being shot. Emma Sullivan’s Into the Deep features stunning footage both pre-murder and in its immediate aftermath, dealing with the shock of the filmmakers realizing what kind of subject they’re following as their film begins to&nbsp;resemble something akin to a horror flick. Writing for Vanyaland, Nick Johnston says, “Into the Deep is a unique beast in a documentary landscape that’s more consumed than ever with the true-crime genre, and it is a must-watch for anyone even slightly curious about the events of this bizarre and tragic crime.” Netflix will release Into the Deep later this year.The Night House (2021)  88%(Photo by Elisha Christian courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: Searchlight PicturesRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDLike A Quiet Place&nbsp;in 2018, The Night House relies on sound to create a terrifying horror experience that will make your bones vibrate. After the loss of her husband, Beth (Rebecca Hall) begins to spend her nights plagued by strange dreams and creepy noises around the house. Critics spoke highly of Hall’s performance, with Birth.Movies.Death’s Ed Travis calling her a “scream queen.” They also commended the string of jump scares that shook audiences at the fest;&nbsp;Bloody Disgusting’s Meagan Navarro explains&nbsp;“[the film] leaves you breathless and your heart pumping hard.” Searchlight Pictures bought the distribution rights for the film and will be releasing at a later date.Scare Me (2020)  84%(Photo by Brendan Banks courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: ShudderRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDNo matter how elaborate or grand a horror movie is, the scariest memories most of us have still belong to the nights we spent as youngsters listening to scary stories after dark. Scare Me takes the tale of an aspiring horror screenwriter trapped in a snowy cabin with a best-selling horror novelist telling each other stories and turns it into an exploration of the creative process and even gender politics, all while delivering a minimalist yet still spooky experience. As Daily Dead’s Heather Wixson writes,&nbsp;“Scare Me is an absolute delight and a real gift for both horror fans as well as those of us who can’t get enough of hearing a good story.’” Shudder will release Scare Me at a later date.Spree (2020)  67%(Photo by Rylan Perry courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: RLJE FilmsRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDEugene Kotlyarenko’s Spree asks, “What if Joker was a streamer and wannabe influencer?” The thriller-comedy, which is shot found-footage style, features&nbsp;Joe Keery doing his best&nbsp;Arthur Fleck impersonation as a guy obsessed with becoming internet famous by streaming a night of violent mayhem. It’s a commentary on our collective obsession with social media, privilege, and the darkness of comment sections. What makes the film more than just a&nbsp;Black Mirror&nbsp;episode is how it infuses&nbsp;jokes and gags into the horror – and then seems to ask why we’re laughing. Nick Allen wrote for RogerEbert.com that “Spree brilliantly shows influencer culture for the totally demented lifestyle that it is.” RLJE Films will release Spree later this year.Like this?

From promising releases by new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week.For the foreseeable future, the specialty box office and all theatrical releases will be on hold as we all make efforts to socially distance ourselves and reduce the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus. With that in mind, we have reshaped our Indie Fresh List to reflect the specialty box office releases that are newly available on&nbsp;streaming services and VOD. This week we have a gender-bent alternative history&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Ned Kelly legend, a high school drama about embezzlement, and the long-awaited conclusion to the beloved Ip Man action saga. In our Spotlight section, we call back to a black and white horror tale that’s newly available to stream online and a horror-comedy starring Will Forte that you might have missed from earlier this year.Streaming This WeekendBad Education (2019)  94%&nbsp;Cory Finley follows up his standout debut&nbsp;Thoroughbreds&nbsp;with this&nbsp;dramatic retelling of the Roslyn School district&nbsp;embezzlement scandal, a salacious tale of sex, greed, and gross stupidity. Writer&nbsp;Mike Makowsky&nbsp;crafted the screenplay from his own experiences as a former student of the infamous elite&nbsp;school district&nbsp;that was embroiled in scandal when it was discovered the administration and Superintendent had stolen over $11 million in frivolous expenses via fraud.&nbsp;With noteworthy performances from&nbsp;Allison Janney,&nbsp;Blockers breakout&nbsp;Geraldine Viswanathan,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hugh Jackman&nbsp;in a&nbsp;career-best turn,&nbsp;the film and its cast look to be major contenders&nbsp;for Emmys in the fall. “A diabolically smart true-life crime drama that stars Hugh Jackman in his best performance since The Prestige,” writes David Ehrlich of Indiewire.Streaming on April 25 at 8pm on HBONow,&nbsp;and&nbsp;HBO Go.Ip Man 4: The Finale (2019)  84%Chinese megastar and&nbsp;fight choreographer&nbsp;Donnie Yen has been a bankable name in Chinese cinema for over three decades, but if you’re not an avid fan of Asian&nbsp;action films, you may have missed his jaw-dropping fight choreography and stunt work from films like Iron Monkey, Seven Swords, and Zhang Yimou’s epic masterwork&nbsp;Hero. Most Americans will recognize him from&nbsp;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, where he played Chirrut Imwe, a blind&nbsp;warrior monk. However, Yen’s most synonymous and successful performance&nbsp;is&nbsp;his portrayal of Bruce Lee’s teacher, Ip Man, for the eponymous film series based on the life of the master martial artist. This weekend the supposed final installment of the series is available to rent on VOD. Each of the four films has been rated fresh on the Tomatometer and raked in impressive box office hauls due mostly to Yen’s performance and mesmerizing fight scenes. Douglas Davidson from Elements of Madness called the finale to the series “a closing tale that solidifies this series as one of the more innovative and emotionally compelling martial arts sagas in recent memory.”Rent or Buy on FandangoNOW&nbsp;(Discounted Series Bundle),&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, and&nbsp;iTunes.True History of the Kelly Gang (2020)  79%The story of Ned Kelly has been adapted over a dozen times for film and television, with everyone from Mick Jagger to&nbsp;Heath Ledger playing the legendary Australian outlaw. This latest version starring 1917’s&nbsp;George MacKay&nbsp;is a queer-bent&nbsp;mystical folk drama that sets itself apart from every iteration&nbsp;that preceded it. Dubbed the “Australian Jessie James,” Kelly serves as an enduring tribute&nbsp;to civil disobedience, and this new retelling is a singular piece of cinema based on&nbsp;Peter Carey’s equally impressive Booker Prize-winning novel.&nbsp;“A compelling, grubby outback Western revealing the ragged reality behind a folk hero [with] terrific performances, incredible visuals, and a reassertion of&nbsp;Justin Kurzel as a bold filmmaker most comfortable dealing with discomfort,” writes&nbsp;Nev Pierce&nbsp;of&nbsp;Empire Magazine.Available April 24 to&nbsp;rent or buy at&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Google Play, and&nbsp;iTunes.Fresh &amp; Available Now on VOD – Spotlight PicksExtra Ordinary (2020)  98%If you’re looking for your next indie comedy, now would be a perfect time to check out&nbsp;Extra Ordinary. In his first feature film lead role since the cult classic&nbsp;MacGruber,&nbsp;Will&nbsp;Forte is brilliant in this&nbsp;clever horror rom-com about a nervous widower&nbsp;and the&nbsp;driving instructor he encounters&nbsp;with supernatural “talents.” Throughout the narrative, the couple&nbsp;battles the spirit world and maybe falls in love.&nbsp;The film’s&nbsp;bizarre cast of characters, botched exorcisms, Satan worship, and truly cringe-worthy comedic moments likely won’t terrify, but will leave you in stitches. Writer/directors&nbsp;Enda Loughman&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Mike Ahern’s&nbsp;debut film is a hit with critics and still boasts a Certified Fresh 98% on the Tomatometer. “A defiantly odd piece of work, one that comes from a very unique sense of humor that works for most of its running time, even if this is the kind of thing that likely connects with the funny bone more on late-night cable than it does in the theater,” writes&nbsp;Brian Tallerico&nbsp;of&nbsp;Roger Ebert.com.Available to rent or buy&nbsp;on&nbsp;FandangoNow,&nbsp;Vudu, Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;and&nbsp;iTunes.&nbsp;The Lighthouse (2019)  90%&nbsp;Last week, Amazon Prime Video made the Oscar-nominated black and white horror tale&nbsp;The Lighthouse available to stream. It hits perhaps a little too close to home&nbsp;given the current situation, but watching Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe go crazy in a remote lighthouse might serve as a reminder of just how bad things&nbsp;could&nbsp;be. Following up his cult smash hit&nbsp;The Witch, Robert Eggers’ sophomore effort is a&nbsp;rain-soaked fever dream in which&nbsp;Pattinson&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dafoe&nbsp;star as two lighthouse keepers – or “wickies” – who are beset and tormented by unseen, or perhaps imaginary, dark forces while cut off from the outside world, with only their uneasy cohabitation to keep them sane. Or not. Heavily influenced by the early 20th-century painter Andrew Wyeth, Eggers (who co-wrote the film with his brother Max Eggers) utilizes 19th-century filming techniques and vintage&nbsp;camera equipment to give the film its distinctive period aesthetic.&nbsp;Lewis Knight of the&nbsp;Daily Mirror&nbsp;describes the film as&nbsp;“[A] gothic, dark fairy-tale, incomprehensible…and incredibly elusive throughout, which only serves to make it more hypnotic as it weaves its dark web before it reaches its chilling&nbsp;climax.”Available&nbsp;to&nbsp;stream now on&nbsp;Amazon; available to rent or buy&nbsp;on&nbsp;FandangoNow,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;and&nbsp;iTunes.Along with… Swallow (2020) , about an affluent housewife who develops a deadly case of pica — the urge to swallow inanimate objects.

Sam Mendes’ acclaimed WWI thriller, which is directed and shot to produce the illusion of a single take, was the leading horse going into the night with a total of nine nominations, and managed to win&nbsp;seven of those: Best Film, Outstanding British Film, Best Director for Mendes, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, Best Production Design, and Best Cinematography for the legendary Roger Deakins.&nbsp;Bong Joon-ho’s&nbsp;Parasite won&nbsp;Best Film Not In the English Language as expected, but also Best Original Screenplay for Joon-ho and co-writer Han Jin-won over the heavily favored Quentin Tarantino.Joker&nbsp;was another big winner on the night, taking out not just Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix – at this point if you’re betting against him on Oscar night you must seriously dislike money – but also winning for Best Original Music for&nbsp;Hildur Guđnadóttir’s score and for Best Casting, the first time that awards has been given out. Among the other acting categories, things went as planned: Renée Zellweger, Laura Dern, and Brad Pitt all took home awards.&nbsp;Perhaps the biggest upset of the night, and one which might shake those feeling smug about their Oscar picks, came in the animated category, where&nbsp;Toy Story 4&nbsp;lost out to Netflix’s holiday film,&nbsp;Klaus.See the full list of winners nominees below and let us know what you think of the BAFTA picks below.&nbsp;BEST FILM1917 89%The Irishman 95%Joker 68%Once Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%Parasite (Gisaengchung) 98%OUTSTANDING BRITISH FILM1917 89%Bait 100%For Sama 99%Rocketman 89%Sorry We Missed You 88%The Two Popes 89%OUTSTANDING DEBUT BY A BRITISH WRITER, DIRECTOR OR PRODUCERMark Jenkin, Kate Byers, Linn WaiteBait 100%Waad Al-Kateab, Edward WattsFor Sama 99%Alex HolmesMaiden 98%Harry WootliffOnly You 96%Álvaro Delgado-AparicioRetablo 100%FILM NOT IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGEThe Farewell 97%For Sama 99%Pain and Glory (Dolor y gloria) 96%Parasite (Gisaengchung) 98%Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Portrait de la jeune fille en feu) 98%DOCUMENTARYAmerican Factory 96%Apollo 11 99%Diego Maradona 90%For Sama 99%The Great Hack 87%ANIMATED FILMFrozen II 78%Klaus 94%A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon 96%Toy Story 4 97%DIRECTORSam Mendes1917 89%Martin ScorseseThe Irishman 95%Todd PhillipsJoker 68%Quentin TarantinoOnce Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%Bong Joon-hoParasite (Gisaengchung) 98%ORIGINAL SCREENPLAYSusanna Fogel, Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Katie SilbermanBooksmart 96%Rian JohnsonKnives Out 97%Noah BaumbachMarriage Story 94%Quentin TarantinoOnce Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%Bong Joon-ho, Han Jin-wonParasite (Gisaengchung) 98%ADAPTED SCREENPLAYSteven ZaillianThe Irishman 95%Taika WaititiJojo Rabbit 80%Todd Phillips, Scott SilverJoker 68%Greta GerwigLittle Women 95%Anthony MccartenThe Two Popes 89%LEADING ACTRESSJessie BuckleyWild RoseScarlett JohanssonMarriage StorySaoirse RonanLittle WomenCharlize TheronBombshellRenée ZellwegerJudyLEADING ACTORLeonardo DiCaprioOnce Upon A Time in HollywoodAdam DriverMarriage StoryTaron EgertonRocketmanJoaquin PhoenixJokerJonathan PryceTwo PopesSUPPORTING&nbsp;ACTRESSLaura DernMarriage StoryScarlett JohanssonJojo RabbitFlorence PughLittle WomenMargot RobbieBombshellMargot RobbieOnce Upon A Time in HollywoodSUPPORTING ACTORTom HanksA Beautiful Day in the NeighborhoodAnthony HopkinsTwo PopesAl PacinoThe IrishmanJoe PesciThe IrishmanBrad PittOnce Upon A Time in HollywoodORIGINAL MUSICThomas Newman1917 89%Michael GiacchinoJojo Rabbit 80%Hildur GuđnadóttirJoker 68%Alexandre DesplatLittle Women 95%John WilliamsStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker 51%CASTINGShayna MarkowitzJoker 68%Douglas Aibel, Francine MaislerMarriage Story 94%Victoria ThomasOnce Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%Sarah CroweThe Personal History of David Copperfield 92%Nina GoldThe Two Popes 89%CINEMATOGRAPHYRoger Deakins1917 89%Rodrigo PrietoThe Irishman 95%Lawrence SherJoker 68%Phedon PapamichaelFord v Ferrari 92%Jarin BlaschkeThe Lighthouse 90%EDITINGThe Irishman 95%Jojo Rabbit 80%Joker 68%Ford v Ferrari 92%Once Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%PRODUCTION DESIGNDennis Gassner, Lee Sandales1917 89%Bob Shaw, Regina GravesThe Irishman 95%Ra Vincent, Nora SopkováJojo Rabbit 80%Mark Friedberg, Kris MoranJoker 68%Barbara Ling, Nancy HaighOnce Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%COSTUME DESIGNChristopher Peterson, Sandy PowellThe Irishman 95%Mayes C.

From promising releases from new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week in Fresh&nbsp;Indie Finds.&nbsp;This week at the specialty box office, we find an inspiring feel-good comedy from Workaholics star Jillian Bell and rapper-turned-actor Utkarsh Ambudkar, as well as a documentary that chronicles the inception of one of Broadway’s most iconic musicals,&nbsp;Fiddler on the Roof. And in the new trailers section, we&nbsp;get our first look at Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver in Marriage&nbsp;Story, Noah Baumbach’s upcoming Netflix film – which will have a small theatrical run –&nbsp;plus a red band preview for a SXSW standout comedy about a wild night of drinking gone terribly wrong.Opening This WeekendBrittany Runs a Marathon (2019)  88%&nbsp;A bogus doctor’s visit prompts an overweight twenty-something to change her life. Inspired by a true story,&nbsp;Brittany Runs A Marathon follows Brittany, a hard-partying, underemployed woman who finds direction and meaning by training to compete in the New York City Marathon. Led by the hilarious Jillian Bell&nbsp;and coming from writer-director&nbsp;Paul Downs Colaizzo, this Sundance Film Festival Audience Award-winner has been a hit with critics since its debut in Park City earlier this year. Featuring two of our favorite Sundance performances&nbsp;from the festival, the movie has been described by&nbsp;Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly as “a&nbsp;whip-smart comedy that manages to deliver genuinely funny uplift without ever swerving away from its own dark side.” The movie was picked up by Amazon at Sundance.Playing&nbsp;limited screens this weekend, expanding on August 30.&nbsp;Fiddler: A Miracle of Miracles (2019)  98%Fiddler on the Roof was one of Broadway’s longest-running and most beloved musicals (it’s still touring the country, and you can still see it Off-Broadway right now – in Yiddish!). Steeped in Jewish identity and marked by incredible set pieces and songs, the show also features one of musical theater’s most coveted male lead roles in Tevye, the put-upon father just trying to keep his family together and strong. Documenting the long road to bring the play to Broadway, and later to the big screen,&nbsp;Fiddler: A Miracle of Miracles is&nbsp;directed by&nbsp;Max Lewkowicz&nbsp;and features interviews from Broadway legends Lin-Manuel Miranda,&nbsp;Harvey Fierstein,&nbsp;and Topol, who played the titular character in the 1971 film adaptation. “An exhaustive, emotional testament to the musical’s staying power as popular entertainment and its extraordinary thematic reach,”&nbsp;writes&nbsp;David Rooney in The Hollywood Reporter.&nbsp;Playing New York &amp; Los Angeles this weekend;&nbsp;expanding to limited screens on Aug 30.&nbsp;Give Me Liberty (2019)  89%Give Me Liberty&nbsp;puts audiences in the car with Vic, a Russian-born medical driver whose personal and professional lives collide when he must transport his immigrant family to a funeral along with his scheduled route of disabled passengers. A hilarious and hectic examination of disability, identity,&nbsp;and the microcosm that is America, Give Me Liberty is a&nbsp;crowdpleaser that was well received at this year’s Sundance Film Festival.&nbsp;Peter Debruge of Variety&nbsp;calls it a “warm, fiercely independent comedy-drama [that] eschews anything resembling formula in favor of a boisterous and freewheeling joyride.”Playing New York and Milwaukee this weekend; expanding to Los Angeles and Madison on Aug 28.Fresh and Still in TheatersOne Child Nation (2019)  98%Spotlight Pick!Still in theaters and expanding this week,&nbsp;One Child Nation shines an important spotlight on the effects of China’s “one-child policy.” To curb the ballooning population rate and protect the country from potential&nbsp;starvation, the government enacted the social experiment&nbsp;in the 1980s with militaristic zeal, and the collateral damage of&nbsp;the zero-tolerance policy is still wreaking havoc on the lives of Chinese people today, years after it was ended. In this acclaimed film, co-directors&nbsp;Jialing Zhang and Nanfu Wang carefully document the policy, its implementation, and thoughts from those it affected, including their own families.&nbsp;Eric Kohn of IndieWire&nbsp;calls&nbsp;One Child Nation a “brilliant combination of cultural reporting and interpersonal reckoning,” and it’s also a heavy favorite for end of year honors.Playing New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Austin, San Francisco, and Washington DC this weekend.&nbsp;Along with… The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019) , a drama about a&nbsp;man with Down syndrome who befriends a drifter and flees his assisted living facility to pursue his dreams of professional wrestling stardom. Luce (2019) , a drama&nbsp;about a school paper that causes a teacher, a community, and a pair of adoptive parents to question a model student’s true motives. Mike Wallace Is Here (2019) , an acclaimed bio-doc on the award-winning&nbsp;journalist Mike Wallace. The Farewell (2019) , a&nbsp;dramedy about a family that opts to concoct an elaborate lie to spare their beloved matriarch and grandmother from the pain of a terminal diagnosis.New Indie TrailersThe Death of Dick Long (2019)  74%A series of unfortunate events places a pair of hapless rednecks in the midst of a murder investigation. The flick is directed by Daniel Scheinert, who made&nbsp;the hilarious and offbeat&nbsp;Swiss Army Man, so you know what you’re getting into.Raise Hell: The Life &amp; Times of Molly Ivins (2019)  95%This new trailer offers a first look at the hilarious documentary about Molly Ivins, a legend in journalism and a true Texas original. The doc pays tribute to the nationally syndicated columnist and is full of her trademark wit.Marriage Story (2019)  94%This week, Netflix released dual&nbsp;trailers for&nbsp;Noah Baumbach’s latest, Marriage Story,&nbsp;starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver as two halves of a bi-coastal couple in the midst of divorce.Like this?

And yes, we're betting on an upset or two!by Jacqueline Coley | April 22, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by © Focus Features)The big night is&nbsp;finally&nbsp;here, and we do mean finally, as this has been the longest season in Oscars History! (You’re feeling as drained as we are by awards season, right?!). The 93rd Academy Awards will be handed out on Sunday evening, and at long last, some of our biggest questions of the season will finally be answered: Who will be named Best Director? Will&nbsp;Nomadland&nbsp;keep up its pace for the final lap and win Best Picture after leading the race all year?&nbsp;And will&nbsp;Diane Warren finally get an Oscar to add to her huge trophy case filled with Grammys? (OK, maybe that’s not a question on everyone’s mind – but we certainly wanna know.)The length of the season and extended eligibility period were not the only big changes for Oscar this year; the ceremony will be different, too, taking place outside at Union Station in Los Angeles and at satellite locations worldwide. All five Best Original Song nominees will be performed during the show, though all were pre-recorded, and organizers have again gone with no host for the third year running. “The show must go on,” as they say, in some shape and form, and despite the pandemic disrupting every aspect of life, and the global box office, the world’s biggest stars will still be on hand to receive those statuettes potentially – from where, however, is still an open question.Download Rotten Tomatoes’&nbsp;printable Oscar Ballot with Tomatometer and Audience Scores or cast your vote in our&nbsp;digital Oscar ballot.To help you with your&nbsp;Oscar ballots&nbsp;– and perhaps to clue in most of the world that the Oscars are still happening – the Rotten Tomatoes team has made&nbsp;some educated guesses on who will win come Sunday night.

But the same was said of La La Land, Get Out, and Roma&nbsp;their respective years and all of them lost in the end. If there is a film that could unseat the Nomadland Goliath, it is Aaron Sorkin’s&nbsp;The Trial of the Chicago 7. An additional wrinkle is the fact many voters haven’t seen as much as they normally would, and apathy may trump inevitability. Be prepared, though: we&nbsp;could even see a shocker like Judas and the Black Messiah or Promising Young Woman winning it all come Sunday, but our&nbsp;money is still on Nomadland.&nbsp;Best Actor In a Leading Role(Photo by © Netflix)Who&nbsp;will win?Chadwick Boseman – Ma Rainey’s Black BottomAnd why? Though Anthony Hopkins is a potential spoiler for his turn as an Alzheimer’s sufferer in The Father, this Oscar is Boseman’s, which is what we’ve been saying since the film debuted last Fall. And while some will say he will win because of his untimely death, he deserves the win for his performance alone – and it will be a fitting tribute to his legacy.Best Actress&nbsp;In A Leading Role(Photo by David Lee/Netflix)Who&nbsp;will win?Viola&nbsp;Davis – Ma Rainey’s Black BottomAnd why?&nbsp;In truth, we don’t know about this one. Andra Day won the Golden Globe for The United States Vs. Billie Holiday, Carey Mulligan took home the Critics Choice for Promising Young Woman, Frances McDormand won the BAFTA for Nomadland,&nbsp;and Viola Davis took home the SAG Award. Without indicative wins to really give us a clear favorite, we are putting the most weight behind the SAG honor.&nbsp;As McDormand is listed as a producer for Nomadland, it is&nbsp;assumed she is not going home empty-handed given that film will likely win Best Picture, so&nbsp;why not give this one to Davis, who’s&nbsp;already down one Oscar after losing for her worthy work in Doubt.&nbsp;Best Actor In a Supporting RoleWho&nbsp;will win?Daniel Kaluuya – Judas and the Black MessiahAnd why?&nbsp;Daniel Kaluuya has been pretty unstoppable since the crime thriller committed to the season earlier this year.&nbsp;With wins at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs, SAGs, and Critic’s Choice Awards, if the Get Out star&nbsp;didn’t win by some fluke, it would be one of the biggest upset in Oscars history. (*whispers*: And that’s just NOT gonna happen.)Best&nbsp;Actress In A Supporting Role(Photo by © A24 / Courtesy Everett Collection)Who&nbsp;will win?Youn Yuh-jung – MinariAnd why?&nbsp;Sorry, Madam Glenn Close, we want you to get that golden statue as much as anyone, but Hillbilly Elegy was – let’s say – not your best outing, at least&nbsp;according to the critics. We’re even more determined she stay seated when the winner is read, as her&nbsp;win&nbsp;would knock&nbsp;out Youn Yuh-jung, brilliant as a grandmother like none you’ve met in Lee Isaac Chung’s moving family drama,&nbsp;Minari, and who is just as deserving as any other veteran for the work she’s given us over five decades.Best Animated Feature FilmWho will win? 95% Soul (2020)And why?&nbsp;In the past 10 years, only one film was able to stop the Disney/Pixar dominance of this category:&nbsp;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.&nbsp;Nothing nominated the year has&nbsp;come close to that film’s momentum. Sorry,&nbsp;Wolfwalkers&nbsp;folk: the movie is brilliant, but Disney/Pixar’s Soul is taking it.Best&nbsp;Cinematography(Photo by ©Searchlight Pictures)Who will win?Joshua James Richards – Nomadland&nbsp;And why? Director Chloé Zhao has not met a vast landscape that she didn’t want to frame in a breathtaking shot, and Joshua James Richards executed every one of the many such moments we get in Nomadland flawlessly. We are giving it to the breathtaking vistas of the American West over the black-and-white craftsmanship of Mank on this one.Best&nbsp;Costume Design&nbsp;(Photo by David Lee/Netflix)Who will win?Ann Roth – Ma Rainey’s Black BottomAnd why? Roth has won every costuming prize this season, and as Ma Rainey’s dresses serve as a part of the character as much as any aspect of Viola Davis’ performance, we have to say this competition is – yeah, we are gonna do it – sewn up.Best&nbsp;Hair &amp; Make-up(Photo by David Lee / © Netflix)Who will win?Mia Neal, Sergio Lopez-Rivera, Jamika Wilson – Ma Rainey’s Black BottomAnd why? Wig-maker and hairstylist Mia Neal&nbsp;created over 100 wigs for&nbsp;Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom&nbsp;in less than three weeks. She styled every performer (including Viola Davis) with&nbsp;hairlines, hair textures, and color that were all authentic to the period. All of the nominees have award-worthy efforts, particularly the make-up work for Italian fantasy Pinocchio. Still, the stellar make-up of Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom tops even that, so we’re putting our money on the Netflix musical drama.Best Director(Photo by Joshua Richards, 20th Century )Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Chloé Zhao – NomadlandAnd why?&nbsp;Putting aside the fact that she shot, directed, and adapted the screenplay for a film that swept every major Director contest this awards season and is an odds-on-lock to win the big prize… actually, that’s it. That’s enough to call it over: Zhao’s winning. The win would make her the first Asian woman to win Best Director, and only the second woman ever to win the award, after Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker.Best Documentary (Feature)Who will win? 97% My Octopus Teacher (2020)And why?&nbsp;After My Octopus Teacher took home the American Cinema Editors’ award for Best Documentary Editing along with a BAFTAs win for Best Documentary, those puzzled by the octopus love story/nature documentary had to resign themselves to the fact this unlikely contender was going to go all the way. As this prize has traditionally gone to films that have chronicled weightier subjects – the 2008 financial crisis, climate change, the Columbine school shooting, doping in Russian sports – it is a slightly unconventional choice, but with such momentum, who could bet against it? (Despite the fact the field – Collective, Crip Camp, The Mole Agent, and Time – is incredibly strong.)Best International Feature Film(Photo by © Samuel Goldwyn Films /Courtesy Everett Collection)Who will win? 92% Another Round (Druk) (2020)And why?&nbsp;The last five times that a director was nominated for&nbsp;both Best&nbsp;International Feature and Best Director, the film in question took home the International Feature prize – with two films, Parasite and Roma, taking both. So with a Best Director nomination for Another Round‘s Thomas Vinterberg, we are betting that his work on the dramedy, and Mads Mikkelsen’s now-iconic drunken dance on a pier, will keep the tradition going.Best&nbsp;Music (Original Score)(Photo by Disney / Pixar)Who will win?Jon Batiste, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross – SoulAnd why?&nbsp;Once&nbsp;Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor (who worked on both&nbsp;Soul&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mank) emerged as double nominees for two of the strongest scores of the season, the question was down to which Oscar-nominated work the voters would prefer to honor.&nbsp;As Soul adds Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show bandleader Jon Batiste’s effervescent smile and incredible orchestrations to the winner’s dais, alongside Ross and Reznor, we are giving the edge to the jazzy Pixar themes of Soul, which also serve as an intricate&nbsp;part of the film’s storytelling.Best&nbsp;Music (Original Song)(Photo by ©Amazon)Who will win?“Speak Now”, Leslie Odom Jr. and Sam Ashworth – One Night in MiamiAnd why?&nbsp;Always a hard category, but this year, in particular, none of the nominees have captured attention like Lady Gaga’s “Shallow” from A Star Is Born or possess the rousing inspiration&nbsp;of the&nbsp;John Legend- and Common-penned Selma anthem “Glory.” However, Leslie Odom Jr., who began the season the odds-on favorite for Best Supporting Actor, has performed his tune “Speak Now” at every major televised ceremony this year, which has kept him – and the tune – top of mind. Diane Warren, who is bizarrely still winless after the 11 nominations, is a possible spoiler for “Io Si (Seen)” from&nbsp;The Life Ahead, but like Glenn Close in a certain other category, she is perhaps gonna have to give it a try next time around.Best Visual Effects(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Who will win? 70% Tenet (2020)And why? Tenet should win easily if&nbsp;voters aren’t holding a grudge against the film’s bungled summer box office rollout. If Midnight Sky, George Clooney’s forgettable space epic – with stunning visuals – comes out on top, we will reckon many voters are still harboring hurt feelings about what happened when Tenet director Christopher Nolan tried but failed to get audiences back into theaters during the pandemic summer.Best Sound(Photo by © Amazon Studios)Who&nbsp;will win? 97% Sound of Metal (2020)And why?&nbsp;Not to be simplistic, but: it’s in the title! The sound for Sound of Metal is a co-lead along with star Riz Ahmed, acutely illustrating his character’s rapid hearing loss over the course of the film. And with six nominations, including for Best Picture, you would have to assume it unlikely the film could go home empty-handed (though many have before), and sound without question is&nbsp;the drama’s most competitive category.Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)(Photo by © Amazon Studios)Who&nbsp;will win?Sacha Baron Cohen and co-writers – Borat Subsequent MoviefilmAnd why?&nbsp;We just kinda like the ‘mess’ of it, and there is no clear frontrunner for Adapted Screenplay, and the Borat sequel joined the likes of The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II&nbsp; with writing noms for both the original&nbsp;and&nbsp;the sequel, so clearly the Academy is a fan. And who wouldn’t want to see Sacha Baron Cohen on stage accepting an award? It’s gonna be funny, we’re very sure of that. In all likelihood, The Father or Nomadland is the safer choice, but you gotta gamble with a couple of choices every ballot, and this is ours.Best&nbsp;Writing (Original Screenplay)(Photo by © Focus Features)Who&nbsp;will win?Emerald Fennell – Promising Young WomanAnd why?&nbsp;Aaron Sorkin, who penned&nbsp;The Trial of the Chicago 7, already has an Oscar and is viewed as one of our generation’s best screenwriters. Still, we are going with&nbsp;Emerald Fennell’s Promising Young&nbsp;Woman,&nbsp;a writing branch&nbsp;and&nbsp;seasoned AMPAS voter favorite. After&nbsp;picking up several wins for comparable categories at other shows this awards season, the only thing that could hold her back would be if folks remember that Fennell also played Camilla Parker Bowles in the last season of The Crown and want to hold a grudge against the actress&nbsp;playing a very much hated character. (So pretty much nothing – nothing holding her back from winning.)Best Editing(Photo by © Netflix)Who&nbsp;will win? 89% The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020)And why? For our Best Editing pick, we are going against the grain a bit and picking The Trial of the Chicago 7 to take this over&nbsp;BAFTA winner Sound of Metal. We are still not 100% convinced that&nbsp;Sound of Metal is the frontrunner everyone assumes it to be. The editing of archival footage in The Trial of the Chicago 7, coupled with Sorkin’s elevated dialogue, is the one-two punch we are betting knocks the Riz Ahmed drama down the ballot – particularly with a voting body comprised of many members who vividly recall the true-life events recreated on screen.Best Production Design(Photo by © Netflix)Who&nbsp;will win? 82% Mank (2020)And why? Ten nominations and decades to make it happened, but sadly Production Design is all that the Old Hollywood tale about the prickly Citizen Kane scriptwriter&nbsp;Herman J. Mankiewicz is likely gonna take home. Still, even in black and white, the incomparable commitment to detail and period authenticity in the backdrops of the David Fincher biopic is undeniable and places Mank far above other competitors in the category: The Father, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Tenet, and News of the World.ShortsDOCUMENTARY&nbsp;SHORT SUBJECT – Do Not SplitLIVE ACTION SHORT SUBJECT – Two Distant StrangersANIMATED SHORT SUBJECT –&nbsp;BurrowThe&nbsp;93rd Academy Awards&nbsp;ceremony&nbsp;will be broadcast at 5 pm PST/8 pm EST on April 25, 2021, on ABC.&nbsp;Download Rotten Tomatoes’&nbsp;printable Oscar Ballot; cast your vote in our&nbsp;digital Oscar ballot.On an Apple device?

The movie about children seeing ghosts and escaping supernaturally scary narcos captured the imagination of horror film festival audiences, leading to its eventual theatrical run and streaming release on Shudder and then to On Demand.But the path to get her passion project to audiences was not a short one. In fact, the little girl who grew up watching Andrei Tarkovsky and Steven Spielberg movies with her dad worked her way up in Mexico City’s film industry, making a name for herself first as a romantic-comedy director. But with an undying love of monsters, ghouls, and other things that go bump in the night, López made Tigers Are Not Afraid against all odds.Read more: Filmmaker Selects: Alma Har’el’s 10 Movies (and a Series) for Women’s History MonthRead more: Filmmaker Selects: Gina Prince-Bythewood’s 10 Movies for Women’s History MonthFortunately, the risks have paid off. Now, the director is juggling multiple projects with collaborators she admires and has many more scares for audiences in mind. As part of our “Filmmaker Selects” series, López spoke to Top Critic Monica Castillo in-between busy writing sessions about her career trajectory, her upcoming projects, and some of the movies she recommends fans check out for Women’s History Month.Monica Castillo for Rotten Tomatoes: Tigers Are Not Afraid is not your first movie, but it’s the film you took the biggest chance on. How did that become the movie you decided to make a new name for yourself?Issa López: As it happens with filmmaking, you have plans and you think things are going to turn one way, and they never ever, ever work that way. So finally, because I had been successful for a long time with comedies, I had enough influence in the Mexican industry and enough respect as a director and as a writer to get into serious subject matter. And I was developing a very ambitious movie about the origins of the cartels during World War II, between Mexico and the US. And I was going to write and direct.Issa López’s Tigers Are Not Afraid.And that, of course, fell apart horribly. Back then, I felt that it was the end of the world. I had invested five years [into the project]. It was my one hope to get away from only comedies. And I didn’t know yet that you can’t have one project or even two or three, you have to have more because they will stumble. So when these fell apart, I had nothing, and I was going through a horrendous breakup and my father had died recently. And I had to put my dog down. It was a mess. And the one thing that kept me sane was writing every day, because I didn’t have time for more in trying to resuscitate this giant. I would have squeezed writing one scene of a movie for my sanity, and that was Tigers. And eventually it came together and I looked at it and I realized I really had to make it. And I knew that it was going to be a very strange little animal – part horror, part political drama, part thriller, part fantasy, and investors and distributors hate movies that are part, part, part, part, part. They hate them. But I knew I had to bring it into the world.What were some of your favorite moments on set?López: There were so many of them. I was having a conversation a couple of days ago with my first AD, who is now a director in her own right and makes me incredibly happy. Her name is Hiromi Kamata, and she’s the director of Selena: The Series. I have to say that many of the best moments in that movie didn’t come from my mind. They came from the mind of my team. I love to create an environment where you trust the people you’ve called to this battle with you, and they come to you and they say, I have an idea of how this can work. And sometimes it doesn’t, and sometimes, it’s so much better than what you had in mind. So there’s a lot of her mind in that movie, but we were talking about experience, and it’s kind of extraordinary how in telling such a dark painful, scary story, we had such a great time. The kids were loving. It’s incredible, because you see them suffering throughout the movie, and they were having a blast. They loved it so much that at the day’s end, they came to me to pitch an idea for the sequel, because they just didn’t want to stop making the movie. And I know they were enjoying it. One of my producers was saying that they had Stockholm Syndrome.How did you pool all those ideas about how the world of the movie would look like to create an immersive experience for your audience?López: For me, it was the clash between horror and hope. It’s pretty much a war zone. These cities that have been abandoned by its inhabitants, either because they left or because they vanished or because they died. Entire sections of cities have become ghost towns. And these kids have taken them over and made them their own. They had decorated them with their totems and their warriors and their war paint to defend this turf. Eventually, in the movie, they move away because they are on the run into parts of town that had been taken over slowly by nature. You have rooms in which grass is growing inside and it becomes this dreamscape. I wanted to have ruin next to beauty, and that encounter gave me images like a flooded room, that idea of a broken chandelier in a pool where there’s wild koi fish is what created this landscape slowly.What was it like to finally bring Tigers Are Not Afraid to audiences?López: It was a complicated journey. I thought when I started production that the complicated part was going to be getting it made, and it was not. Once it was made and finished, me and my accomplices, my team, we looked at the movie and we were like, this doesn’t feel bad, and it doesn’t feel similar to other things. It feels pretty unique. We felt very cocky that we could get the movie into the festivals. We were at the beginning like, should we submit to Toronto or Sundance? And eventually we got rejected from all of them, all of them – Toronto, Sundance, Berlin, Venice, Tribeca, South by Southwest, all of the festivals. It was kind of shocking because we didn’t feel that necessarily we had a masterpiece, but we felt that we had something unique enough and decent enough to get in that. No.It got really painful because after getting a number of rejections, you have to question yourself. Eventually, it became funny, and I was ready to give up and make more comedies, which I will always go back to. And then I thought about the genre festivals, because it is a ghost story. And I sent it to Fantastic Fest. The first time that I saw the movie with an audience in my life was at Fantastic Fest, and I was hopeful, but I was not expecting what happened. The raw emotions I saw in the audience and the way people would stop me at the end in tears to talk to me about it, it was a beautiful shock, and it especially felt great after the journey of rejection that we had, and it snowballed from there. That long journey of trying to make a huge movie that failed, resulting in this strange tiny movie, making it, getting all the rejections, and then getting this reaction so many years later, just makes you feel that maybe karma exists, that if you never lose hope and vision of your ideals, you get there. It’s a dangerous thing to believe, but I’m starting to accept it.(Photo by Issa López's Tigers Are Not Afraid.)What was your experience like before taking on Tigers Are Not Afraid?López: I think that filmmakers can make a career in two very different ways. One is seizing the opportunities that you find along the path and taking whatever opportunity to try to say your own thing. The other one is the anarchist warrior that decides to make the movie that they came into the world to make. I admire those strange unicorns. I’m not that. And especially, it’s hard because you’re a woman, and it’s a lot harder to push those walls. Now, it’s easier – well, it’s less difficult, which is different. But when I started, that space didn’t exist. Very few movies were made in Mexico. When I went into film school, eight movies were made in Mexico and those eight movies were made by the same four guys. It was unthinkable to break into that. I had to build my own way and my way of going there was through the cracks. Telenovelas shaped half of the planet. That’s the truth. The only way for me to go into visual storytelling was telenovelas. And the only way to go into telenovelas was by ghost writing for other writers. I had to first ghost write then become a proper telenovela writer, then become a film writer.And at that point, Mexican cinema had a revival, but it was through comedy – romantic-comedy specifically. So I had to write rom-coms, which has never been my genre. And then I was like, okay, I can direct too. Eventually, I got a lot of respect as a comedy director. I love comedy, but the truth is that little girl that watched horror movies and genre, and a little bit of Bergman and perhaps too much of Tarkovsky wanted to make a movie for me, for that little girl. And that’s how Tigers happened.López cites Poltergeist as an early influence. (Photo by © MGM/courtesy Everett Collection)Jumping back in time, who were some of the first directors that influenced you?López: It was a very strange mix because I was, on one hand, a regular kid who just loved movies. And on the other hand, I was raised by my dad because my mom died when I was very young. My dad was obsessed with European cinema, art house cinema, and the big film masters. At the time, Tarkovsky was at the height of his&nbsp; popularity, everybody was discovering the next Tarkovsky movie and we would go when I was six, eight, 10-years-old, and I would sit and watch Solaris. Because your taste is not completely gelled at that age, I could completely enjoy Solaris without questions about pacing, because everything is new for you. At the same time, I was obsessed with Spielberg’s movies and I was completely captured by the idea of Poltergeist or The Goonies.I never thought I could make cinema by watching Bergman, but when I watched E.T., I was so completely floored and transported by that experience. I grew up in Mexico City, and I had this feeling that someone needs to do this [movie], but in Mexico. It hasn’t been done. Briefly, I entertained the idea that I was going to abandon my dream of becoming an archeologist to become a filmmaker. Then I decided I was going to be serious, be an archeologist. That was not serious though, and I went back to cinema. I discovered down the line that it was more about Raiders of the Lost Ark than what it was about archeology.You’ve alluded to it already a little, but this industry is not always welcoming to women. Has that changed at all in your experience?López: I believe that this year has been crucial. I think we’re seeing it in the awards season, and you can take it seriously or not, but it is a signal of something. It’s a sign of something. It’s signaling something. If you look at the hopefuls, you’re going to see a lot of women filmmakers in a way that you didn’t see even a couple of years ago. And I think that part of it is the awareness that started in 2017, which is the year I opened Tigers. And the awareness of how an entire industry had been brutally, not only unfair, but punishing for the entire female part of it.Tarkovsky’s Solaris. (Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection)Genre film has a macho reputation – it’s dominated by male filmmakers targeting male audiences. What has that side of the industry been like for women recently?López: Well, that was a particularly complicated landscape. First of all, the perception of genre has changed. Thank the gods on this one. When I first moved to LA to try to pursue making movies here, I had the first meetings with the studios and with reps and whatnot, I would mention that I loved horror and I had some horror ideas. Inevitably, the room would cool down, and they would be like, “Oh.” And eventually someone spelled it out to me, which is: Horror is great, but it was like the B-movies at that point, and I’m talking 10 years ago, not that long ago; if you have a chance of making anything non-horror, do that, because once you’re a horror director, that’s it, you’re a horror directorBecause it was perceived like a gritty B-movie universe, women really didn’t have a place there. It’s funny because if you look at the numbers of audiences that appreciate horror, so many of them are women. It’s funny that the vocal ones were guys, but so many women love a good ghost story. I’m not a huge fan of slasher films, but I know so many women are obsessed with the slasher movies. It’s this misconception about gender roles, it’s just not feminine to like movies with ax-wielding maniacs. Well, turns out it is. It is pretty f–king feminine, and we have this incredibly violent genre of movies being made by women.Could you tell us about some of the projects on the horizon for you?López: It’s a lot of things, too many. I did learn my lesson of, in Spanish we say, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, honey.” I don’t do that anymore, so I have a lot of baskets and a lot of eggs. I have a movie produced by Noah Hawley, who I didn’t know before. Noah is the writer and producer, creator of Fargo, the series, and of Legion. We have a project called The Book of Souls about how humanity runs out of souls to put in newborns and we can only get the souls of people who die and the mechanics that awakens in the world. It’s a meditation on privilege, too. All of these languages, all of those themes, resonated with me. So, that’s one thing.I have a thing with Jason Blum that is an adaptation of an amazing article that Epic Magazine published. The article is written by Daniel Hernandez, a really great journalist, and it’s about a Catholic school – this is a real case outside of Mexico City in a very, very poor area, a massive boarding school that recruits girls from all over Mexico, from the poorest areas, to give them an opportunity to study high school and advance in life. It’s a Catholic boarding school. In 2007, there was an epidemic of hysteric attacks where the girls became paralyzed and they couldn’t move. They would have extreme pain and seizures, and they were convinced they were cursed. It was a huge scandal in Mexico, and eventually it vanished, but what really happened with these 600 girls that felt they were cursed? At the same time, it’s about faith and the strange images Catholicism and ideas Catholicism puts in our heads. It’s about access, how you come from areas where you have no privileges, you have to accept whatever life puts in front of you. It’s about being a woman that is always at risk, be it in the fringes of society or even when you’re put under protection, you’re actually still at risk.One of López’s upcoming project will see her collaborate with Guillermo del Toro. (Photo by Kerry Hayes/Universal Pictures)I have a werewolf western with Guillermo del Toro, and that’s completely different. That’s a completely male story. It’s about male revenge, pain, and old, old debts that characters have to pay and the journey they go through that. In the end, it’s about the beast that we all try to keep controlled, but we really can’t control. I also have a project of my own. I think it’s very important as a filmmaker to always have one movie that nobody asked for, which was what Tigers was for me. That is called A Girl with a Thousand Names, and it’s all children. I’m super excited about that one.Who are some of the up-and-coming women directors people should keep an eye out for?López: Well, what Chloé Zhao is doing is insane, and as I was saying a moment ago, awards season is here and she’s going to take everything that she hasn’t taken yet. Here she already took everything and it’s fascinating, these contemplative, melancholic, incredibly lyrical movies. It’s not only about female characters. What she did last year was amazing, too. I’m very curious where she’s going to go with that. There’s Ana Lily Amirpour: A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night is so aesthetic and so badass and so absolutely unique and its own animal that I’m very curious about what she’s going to do. I personally know Coralie Fargeat (Revenge), who also can direct action and gore and violence like nobody’s business. She can make ugliness beautiful. I don’t know what Coralie is doing, I’m just so curious. She’s amazing.Mati Diop! Atlantics is, I’m pretty sure, is my favorite 2019 movie, and I was kind of disappointed that it didn’t get the attention I felt it deserved. That movie’s at the same time a whodunit, a ghost story, a love story, the political reality of what’s happening in the Arabian states where you have extreme riches and extreme poverty, and it’s beautiful to look at. It has everything. I think I’ve watched it like five times.And finally, who are some of the women directors that inspire you?López: First of all, and foremost, I’m going to go with St. Kathryn Bigelow, because I feel that she’s been doing this for a while. Another thing that I admire about Bigelow enormously is her ability to move between genres. She doesn’t care much about genre, but she cares about character and story. She started with horror, with vampires no less, and it’s very hard to make a vampire story that is not silly. She’s done heist movies, some of the best in the world, classics really at this point. And she’s done sci-fi and she’s done the most serious political thrillers that we’ve seen. Hurt Locker, for me, is really one of the best movies that I’ve seen. It’s, for me, top 10, that movie. It’s at the same time a character study, it’s a study of political conflict, of imperialism, of the seduction of violence, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It’s just amazing.Issa López’s Tigers Are Not Afraid is available now on Vudu and FandangoNOW.Issa López’s 10 Films for Women’s History MonthAtlantics (2019) 96%In Dakar, a group of construction workers abandon their work on a sky-scraper in response to months of withheld wages.

William James (Jeremy Renner), Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are members of a bomb-disposal unit in Baghdad. As their tour of duty enters its final weeks, the men face a set of increasingly hazardous situations, any of which could end their lives in an explosive instant.Critics Consensus: A well-acted, intensely shot, action filled war epic, Kathryn Bigelow’s The Hurt Locker is thus far the best of the recent dramatizations of the Iraq War.Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, written by Mark BoalThe Matrix (1999) 88%Neo (Keanu Reeves) believes that Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), an elusive figure considered to be the most dangerous man alive, can answer his question — What is the Matrix? Neo is contacted by Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a beautiful stranger who leads him into an underworld where he meets Morpheus. They fight a brutal battle for their lives against a cadre of viciously intelligent secret agents. It is a truth that could cost Neo something more precious than his life.Critics Consensus: Thanks to the Wachowskis’ imaginative vision, The Matrix is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects.Written and directed by Lilly and Lana WachowskiCidade de Deus (City of God) (2003) 91%In the poverty-stricken favelas of Rio de Janeiro in the 1970s, two young men choose different paths. Rocket (Seu Jorge) is a budding photographer who documents the increasing drug-related violence of his neighborhood. José “Zé” Pequeno (Leandro Firmino da Hora) is an ambitious drug dealer who uses Rocket and his photos as a way to increase his fame as a turf war erupts with his rival, “Knockout Ned” (Matheus Nachtergaele). The film was shot on location in Rio’s poorest neighborhoods.Critics Consensus: City of God offers a shocking and disturbing — but always compelling — look at life in the slums of Rio de Janiero.Directed by Kátia Lund and Fernando MeirellesOrlando (1993) 83%In 1600, nobleman Orlando (Tilda Swinton) inherits his parents’ house, thanks to Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp), who commands the young man to never change.

One morning, Orlando is shocked to wake up as a woman and returns home, struggling as a female to retain her property as the centuries roll by.Critics Consensus: Orlando can’t match its visual delights with equally hefty narrative — but it’s so much fun to watch that it doesn’t need to.Written and directed by Sally PotterAmerican Psycho (2000) 69%In New York City in 1987, a handsome, young urban professional, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), lives a second life as a gruesome serial killer by night. The cast is filled by the detective (Willem Dafoe), the fiance (Reese Witherspoon), the mistress (Samantha Mathis), the coworker (Jared Leto), and the secretary (Chloë Sevigny). This is a biting, wry comedy examining the elements that make a man a monster.Critics Consensus: If it falls short of the deadly satire of Bret Easton Ellis’s novel, American Psycho still finds its own blend of horror and humor, thanks in part to a fittingly creepy performance by Christian Bale.Directed by Mary Harron, written by Mary Harron and Guinevere TurnerSeven Beauties (Pasqualino Settebellezze) (1976) 72%In 1930s Italy, Pasqualino (Giancarlo Giannini), a low-level Sicilian thug, kills a man who disgraced his sister.

They form a bond that is as unlikely as it is heartfelt and meaningful.Critics Consensus: Effectively balancing humor and subtle pathos, Sofia Coppola crafts a moving, melancholy story that serves as a showcase for both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.Written and directed by Sofia CoppolaBig (1988) 97%After a wish turns 12-year-old Josh Baskin (David Moscow) into a 30-year-old man (Tom Hanks), he heads to New York City and gets a low-level job at MacMillen Toy Company. A chance encounter with the owner (Robert Loggia) of the company leads to a promotion testing new toys. Soon a fellow employee, Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins), takes a romantic interest in Josh. However, the pressure of living as an adult begins to overwhelm him, and he longs to return to his simple, former life as a boy.Critics Consensus: Refreshingly sweet and undeniably funny, Big is a showcase for Tom Hanks, who dives into his role and infuses it with charm and surprising poignancy.Directed by Penny Marshall, written by Gary Ross and Anne SpielbergOn an Apple device?

Brown, and Two Pop Culture Documentaries Lead the WayCheck out the latest Fresh indie releases, including what's still in theaters and what's coming soon.by Jacqueline Coley | November 13, 2019 |  CommentsJoin us weekly as&nbsp;Rotten Tomatoes reports on what’s opening, expanding, and coming to the specialty box office. From promising releases from new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week in Fresh&nbsp;Indie Finds.&nbsp;This week at the specialty box office, we have an exciting new feature from the director of It Comes At Night, a couple of insightful documentaries, and a gripping political procedural from the man who&nbsp;penned The Informant!.&nbsp;In our spotlight section, Shia LaBeouf is back after his screenwriting debut earned a glowing reception, and in our indie trailer section, we have a new clip from filmmaker Jennifer Reeder.Opening This WeekendEverybody's Everything (2019)  100%Genre-bending musician Lil Peep’s music is difficult to categorize. Uniquely blending punk, emo, and trap, he was poised to revolutionize the music industry when his life was tragically cut short. Executive produced by Terrence Malick, Everybody’s Everything digs deep into Lil Peep’s upbringing and how, at&nbsp;the height of his fame, he tried to be all things to all people. The film features behind-the-scenes videos, live performances, and interviews with those closest to the artist,&nbsp;who died&nbsp;tragically of a drug overdose at 21 years of age. “The juxtaposition between Peep at home as a kid, and a not-much-older Peep cast out in front of the world, is both fascinating and heartbreaking,” writes Dan Caffrey of the Consequence of Sound.&nbsp;Playing New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Seattle, Phoenix, Tucson, Columbus OH, Birmingham, Knoxville, Portland, Orlando, Denver, Oklahoma City, Indianapolis, Tampa, Atlanta, &amp; Dallas-Ft. Worth&nbsp;this weekend;&nbsp;expanding to limited screens on November 22.Waves (2019)  84%Waves, the deeply personal, semi-autobiographical third feature from indie darling director Trey Edwards Shults, hits theaters this weekend. Starring an indie fave, a network TV superstar, a Hamilton alum, and an exciting newcomer, this stylized “love story” follows a young wrestler who battles familial pressures and the burdens of minority exceptionalism.&nbsp;Critics are lauding&nbsp;outstanding performances from&nbsp;Sterling K. Brown,&nbsp;Kelvin Harrison Jr.,&nbsp;Renée Elise Goldsberry,&nbsp;and newcomer&nbsp;Taylor Russell,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;inventive narrative is set to make – yeah, we’re gonna say it –&nbsp;waves this awards season. “A stunning achievement,” writes&nbsp;Joey Magidson of Hollywood News adding,&nbsp; “Shults’ filmmaking, the score from [Trent] Reznor and [Atticus] Ross, as well as the performances by Brown, Harrison Jr., [Lucas] Hedges, and Russell are exemplary.”Playing New York and Los Angeles&nbsp;this weekend;&nbsp;expanding to more screens on November 22.Scandalous: The Untold Story of the National Enquirer (2019)  83%Scandalous: The Untold Story of the National Enquirer should be consumed en masse, given the current climate of the media landscape, but it’s a meal that may prove to be an acquired taste. Chronicling the creation and rise to prominence of the notorious tabloid magazine,&nbsp;National Enquirer, documentary filmmaker&nbsp;Mark Landsman takes an unflinching look at how the paper’s popularity once, and still, shapes modern politics and journalistic practices. Former staffers detail how what went on behind the scenes was even more outlandish than what made the front page of the magazine, a&nbsp;sometimes hero and frequent villain in the national conversation. “A fascinating and essential examination of the media we consume and what consumes us,” writes Karen Peterson of Awards Circuit.&nbsp;Playing New York and Los Angeles, Miami, Washington DC, Lafayette, Austin, Sante Fe, Albuquerque, Denver Columbus, Birmingham, Seattle, San Fransico,&nbsp; Minneapolis, &amp; Boston&nbsp;this&nbsp;weekend.&nbsp;The Report (2019)  82%Fresh off Martin Scorsese dubbing him the “greatest actor of his generation,”&nbsp;and just days away from his&nbsp;worldwide media tour for the&nbsp;final chapter of the Skywalker saga,&nbsp;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&nbsp;(in which he plays villain Kylo Ren), Adam Driver also has two Oscar-caliber performances set to hit theaters soon. One of them,&nbsp;The Report,&nbsp;hits theaters this week, and it was a big hit with critics when it premiered at Sundance earlier this year. From director Scott Z. Burns,&nbsp;The Report&nbsp;is the fictionalized retelling of how the 9/11 “Torture Report” was commissioned and eventually released to the American public, similar to other journalistic procedurals like All The President’s Men and Spotlight. Neil Pond of Parade Magzine,&nbsp;calls it “A&nbsp;crackling political intrigue thriller, about big issues that matter, made out of real-life characters and events from the not-so-distant past.”Playing New York, Los Angeles, Santa Fe, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Columbus, Dallas, Fort Worth, Denver,&nbsp; Houston, Indianapolis, Louisville, Philadelphia, Portland, Salt Lake City, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington DC,&nbsp;Miami,&nbsp;and other select markets&nbsp; this weekend.Fresh and Still in TheatersHoney Boy (2019)  94%SPOTLIGHT PICK!Last weekend,&nbsp;Shia LaBeouf‘s tale about his traumatic upbringing at the hands of his alcoholic father crashed into the specialty box office with sold-out shows, a $75,000 per-screen average, and over $300,000 in receipts. That’s right, Shia is&nbsp;back on the Indie Fresh List as our spotlight pick! Earlier this year, the&nbsp;Transformers&nbsp;star charmed his way back into our hearts&nbsp;with&nbsp;The Peanut Butter Falcon,&nbsp;playing a lovable drifter who accompanies a man with Down syndrome on a riverboat to fulfill his wrestling dreams.&nbsp;Last week, audiences finally got a glimpse at&nbsp;Honey Boy,&nbsp;his semi-autobiographical&nbsp;drama about his time as a child star and his tumultuous relationship with his father. In a screenplay&nbsp;he wrote as part of court-mandated therapy, LaBeouf plays his own troubled father, while Noah Jupe and&nbsp;Lucas Hedges&nbsp;play the fictionalized versions of the actor as a boy and young adult, respectively. Director&nbsp;Alma Har’el&nbsp;makes her narrative film debut here, and her music video and documentary roots served her well for this based-on-true-events tale. “Raw, uncompromising, and yet wholly non-judgemental,&nbsp;Honey Boy&nbsp;is a cinematic memoir for the ages,” writes&nbsp;Carmen Paddock from&nbsp;One Room With A View.Playing New York and Los Angeles&nbsp;this weekend;&nbsp;expanding&nbsp;to San Francisco and Washington, D.C. on November 15.Along with… Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019) ,&nbsp; a satire about a low-income family who try to hustle their way to a better life through their association with an affluent family. Pain and Glory (Dolor y gloria) (2019) , a drama about an aging director who reflects on his films, collaborators, and legacy after he’s sidelined by severe back pain. The Lighthouse (2019) ,&nbsp;a surreal psychological horror film about two men tortured by the elements and each other while isolated in a remote lighthouse.

Looking for something a little different than a broad comedy or candy-colored kid flick? If you’re willing to trek a little bit to your nearest arthouse or indie movie theater, you may be in luck, because there have been a wealth of outstanding independent films at the cineplexes this year, and more still to come.This week in particular is a strong one, with a pair of extremely Certified Fresh films (Hereditary at 94% on the Tomatometer and&nbsp;Won’t You Be My Neighbor at a whopping 99%) and a handful more that have amassed near universal critical acclaim. But we’ve also got a lot of incredible stuff in theaters right now, as well as some surefire hits coming up in the near future. With all that in mind, we decided to put together a small list of some of the best indie fare for you to seek out right now or plan to watch in the next few months.Opening This WeekWon't You Be My Neighbor? (2018)  97%(Photo by Jim Judkis/Focus Features)Make sure to pack some tissues for this warm,&nbsp;affectionate look at the life and career of Fred Rogers, the man behind the long-running, influential children’s show. It only opens in 29 theaters this week, so check your local listings to see if it’s playing near you. It’s already Certified Fresh at 98%, so if you can get to it, you’re sure to find it a rewarding experience.This movie is at once unapologetically admiring and intellectually rigorous.– A.O. Scott, New York TimesBy the end … no, I wasn’t crying, there was something in my eye.– Moira MacDonald, Seattle TimesFor the many generations that grew up with Rogers’ friendly face as their guide, Won’t You Be My Neighbor is like peering into the past with renewed clarity and wishing his civility had caught on.– Eric Kohn, IndieWireHereditary (2018)  89%(Photo by A24)This is one indie you won’t have to go far to see, because it’s opening in fairly wide release this week, and according to critics, it’s well worth the price of admission if you’re looking for some scares. The film premiered to rave reviews earlier this year at Sundance, with particular praise for Toni Collette’s riveting performance as a mother whose family is devastated by tragedy and terrorized by unseen forces, and it’s likely to be one of the biggest horror hits of the year… at least, until&nbsp;Halloween and&nbsp;Suspiria are unleashed.Where other actresses would play a single note, Collette plays a symphony of emotions. She will nearly bring you to tears and then make you laugh before you know it. Academy Awards don’t even feel like enough of a plaudit for this kind of performance.– Katie Walsh, Tribune News ServiceHereditary is that rare thing – a smart horror movie that doesn’t outsmart itself by refusing to deliver. Its mood is dark and forbidding and just keeps building. Its scares are genuinely shocking. And the ending…– Stephen Whitty, New York Daily NewsA deeply unsettling film, the kind of horror movie that pulls from relatable human emotions like grief and resentment to ultimately become an absolute nightmare.– Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.comHearts Beat Loud (2018)  92%(Photo by Gunpowder &amp; Sky)Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation) and Kiersey Clemons (Transparent,&nbsp;Dope) star in this heartfelt comedy about the rift that develops between a father and his college-bound daughter when they start a band together and find unexpected success,&nbsp;only for the father to&nbsp;have second thoughts about letting his daughter go. This was another Sundance favorite — incidentally, it also co-stars Toni Collette — with critics calling it a sweet and earnest story strengthened by pair of excellent performances at its center.Frank and Sam make beautiful music together. No, that’s not a metaphor; it’s an accurate description that’s central to what makes Hearts Beat Loud&nbsp;such an engaging endeavor.– Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles TimesThere’s not a rough edge in sight – and, for many viewers, that will be just fine.– Jeannette Catsoulis, New York TimesMusic is the tie that binds a Brooklyn father and daughter in a film that refuses to go sappy on us thanks to the tough core of intelligence and wit that Nick Offerman brings to the party.– Peter Travers, Rolling StoneIn Theaters NowFirst Reformed (2018)  93%Ryan FujitaniThe past couple of years have been quite strong for Ethan Hawke, and he added to his already impressive filmography with this Certified Fresh drama written and directed by Paul Schrader. Here, he plays the pastor of a historic New York church who, in addition to having a bit of a troubled life of his own, also struggles with a crisis of faith, until he sees the chance for redemption in a pregnant parishioner (Amanda Seyfried) who comes to him for help. Critics have called this Schrader’s best film in decades and one of Hawke’s finest performances.First Reformed, a mesmerizingly austere drama of one man’s apocalyptic crisis of faith, feels like the movie Paul Schrader was put on this planet to make.– Ann Hornaday, Washington PostFirst Reformed&nbsp;is an amazing examination of faith, a film that stays with you long after you have left the theater.– Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona RepublicIt is an exquisite piece of filmmaking and also a blunt, pulpy instrument, a despairing, fully sustained howl of a movie that is easily this director’s finest work in years.– Justin Chang, Los Angeles TimesRBG (2018)  93%(Photo by Magnolia Pictures)Like&nbsp;Won’t You Be My Neighbor?, this documentary focuses on&nbsp;an influential public figure — albeit a decidedly more divisive one — from a personal angle.&nbsp; The subject, of course, is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an accomplished academic and legal scholar who became a vocal advocate for gender equality and civil rights before she was appointed as a Supreme Court Justice in 1993. It may not appeal to those opposed to her politics, but critics call it an insightful and inspiring profile of a fascinating, exceptional woman.I left the theatre informed, inspired, and eager to go to sleep at a normal hour.– Sheelah Kolhatkar, New YorkerFinding reciprocity — in the eyes of the law, your partner, your colleagues — is the essence of this documentary, one that comes at a moment that desperately lacks it.– Joshua Rothkopf, Time OutGiven the partisan divide, the documentary probably will be of interest only to people who already admire Justice Ginsburg, but it’s a good story that will inspire many and should appeal to anyone with an open mind.– Mick LaSalle, San Francisco ChronicleUpgrade (2018)  88%(Photo by Blumhouse)Some of the best genre fare comes from independent studios (e.g.&nbsp;Hereditary), and Blumhouse has made a nice little home for itself in horror. This Certified Fresh sci-fi revenge thriller comes from Blumhouse offshoot BH Tilt, and it stars Logan Marshall-Green as a mechanic who&nbsp;suffers a deadly mugging attack that leaves him paralyzed and his wife dead, undergoes experimental treatment that grants him — ahem —&nbsp;upgraded abilities, and sets out to hunt the baddies who got him. It’s pure B-movie fluff, but critics say it’s well-executed, compelling, and worth a watch.Upgrade, an irresistibly gory science-fiction melodrama, is B-movie schlock done right.– Simon Abrams, RogerEbert.comA great and grimy little screw-turner of sci-fi schlock, the kind that they truly don’t make anymore, the kind that would make Carpenter and Cameron proud.– Emily Yoshida, VultureUpgrade is hugely enjoyable and delivers just about everything it promised. In another summer of computer-generated blockbusters, it’s a handmade blast of entertainment.– Rafer Guzman, NewsdayAmerican Animals (2018)  88%(Photo by The Orchard)Evan Peters and Barry Keoghan star in this Certified Fresh heist caper about four privileged college students&nbsp;in Kentucky who decide to rob their university’s library of its priceless book and art collection. Based on real events that happened in the early 2000s, the film intercuts interviews with the real people involved in the botched amateur job to add a documentary element, and critics say it&nbsp;does an admirable job of digging into the boys’ motivations and crafting a narrative that’s fun, fascinating, and ultimately a little mind-boggling.A stylish and engaging caper.– Mara Reinstein, Us WeeklyAmerican Animals is one fact-based heist frolic with a youthful slant that works in spite of itself.– Rex Reed, New York ObserverA riveting college-boy crime caper that speeds along on pure movie-movie adrenaline, before U-turning into a sobering reflection on young male privilege and entitlement.– Guy Lodge, VarietyComing SoonEighth Grade (2018)  99%Ryan FujitaniComing to&nbsp;theaters on&nbsp;July 13You’ll find no shortage of quirky coming-of-age stories in the independent movie scene, and it usually takes something special to stand out from the very crowded field. Bo Burnham appears to have done just that with his latest, a charming comedy that follows graduating eighth grader Kayla (Elsie Fisher) as she navigates the awful final week of her already awful middle school career. The film has drawn comparisons to last year’s&nbsp;Lady Bird — albeit a slightly younger version — which is already a good sign, and it doesn’t hurt that out of 35 reviews so far, not a single one is negative.Eighth Grade&nbsp;isn’t a documentary, but it hews as close to the modern coming-of-age experience as currently seems possible.– Kate Erbland, IndieWireFisher delivers a glorious symphony of awkward poignancy, from Kayla’s cringe-worthy attempts to chat up a popular girl to her ultimately sweet connection with her kind, befuddled single dad.– Moira MacDonald, Seattle TimesBurnham’s accomplished debut offers plenty for viewers of all ages, along with a filmmaking vision that is well beyond many of his comedy peers.– Nick Allen, RogerEbert.comLeave No Trace (2018)  100%Ryan FujitaniComing to&nbsp;theaters on June 29Ben Foster has always quietly snuck around the periphery of the A-list, popping up here and there in smaller, well-regarded films like&nbsp;Rampart,&nbsp;Lone Survivor, and&nbsp;Hell or High Water&nbsp;and acting the hell out of them —&nbsp;Leave no Trace is his latest winning effort. Here he stars opposite Thomasin Mackenzie in Debra Granik’s sobering drama about a military veteran living off the grid in the forests of Oregon with his 13-year-old daughter until they are discovered, forced into social services, and flee to make a break for the wilds. Count this another film that has earned unanimous praise from critics so far, adding another great entry in the filmographies of everyone involved.As a depiction of a certain corner of American life, Leave No Trace is vivid and true.– A.A. Dowd, AV ClubAn absorbing, delicately directed and acted father-daughter drama.– Jon Frosch, Hollywood ReporterIt might not have the genre elements that helped make Winter’s Bone something of a breakout, but Leave No Trace rivets and terrifies in its own way.– Bilge Ebiri, Village VoiceSorry to Bother You (2018)  93%(Photo by Annapurna Pictures)Coming to&nbsp;theaters on July 61990s hip hop heads will remember the brash, politically charged music of Oakland-based The Coup, and now that group’s frontman, Boots Riley, has delivered an equally incisive satire on film. Starring&nbsp;Atlanta‘s LaKeith Stanfield, this surreal comedy centers on a black telemarketer who learns the quickest way up the&nbsp;corporate ladder is to adopt a “white voice” on the phone, but professional success may come at the price of his integrity. The supporting cast includes Tessa Thompson, Armie Hammer, Terry Crews, and Steven Yeun, and critics have raved about it since its Sundance debut. It’s a somewhat experimental film with lots of inventive touches, so it may catch some viewers off guard, but it’s likely to be a conversation starter for anyone daring enough to check it out.What the movie lacks in focus it makes up for in flipped-bird absurdity.– David Fear, Rolling StoneSorry to Bother You is a house party of a movie, some rooms more lively than others, some you wish you could spend more time in, some downright unforgettable in the best way.– Emily Yoshida, VultureSorry to Bother You is already a whip-smart satire of racial dynamics in the workplace when it’s about a black telemarketer who uses a white voice to improve his business. Then the naked human-horse mutants show up.– Eric Kohn, IndieWireDamsel (2018)  68%(Photo by Magnolia Pictures)Coming to theaters on June 22The brotherly duo of David and Nathan Zellner do it all, from writing to directing to acting, and their new film is something of an odd twist on the traditional western. Set during the American Old West, this off-kilter comedy stars Robert Pattinson&nbsp;and Mia Wasikowska as Samuel and Penelope, a couple about to be wed when Penelope is kidnapped and Samuel embarks on a journey across the frontier to save her. The Zellners have an eccentric rhythm to their comedy that critics say is fully employed here to upend common conventions of the genre, resulting in an unusual adventure with enough surprises to keep things interesting.It takes a bit to get accustomed to the Zellners’ style – but once you do, boy, does Damsel&nbsp;really blossom.– Sara Stewart, New York PostDavid and Nathan Zellner have crafted an anti-western, lovingly poking fun at its foundation while slyly pulling the rug under the audience in humorous, forward-thinking, and genre-redefining fashion.– Jordan Raup, The Film StageDamsel manages to import any number of modern notions into a surprisingly traditional western structure, recognising the appeal of the genre while not being afraid to steer it into some distinctly modern channels.– Nick Roddick, London Evening StandardThe Miseducation of Cameron Post (2018)  86%(Photo by FilmRise)Coming to theaters on August 3Chloë Grace Moretz stars in this drama&nbsp;adapted by&nbsp;writer-director Desiree Akhavan (Appropriate Behavior) from a young adult novel about an orphaned high school girl — named Cameron Post, of course — who is sent by her guardians to a&nbsp;gay therapy center when she’s discovered making out with the prom queen. Critics so far have praised the film for its decision to focus on Cameron herself, peppering moments of humor and joy to balance out the absurd reality of her situation. It’s not lighthearted viewing by any means, but it’s an earnest, confidently directed and acted film that proves YA novels don’t have to be about the end of the world to be compelling.It beautifully articulates the need for young people to realize the validity of who they are, and even more beautifully crystalizes the moment when that starts to happen.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireGenerously peppered with biting humor and warmed by a generous spirit that extends understanding, if not forgiveness, even to the religious zealot characters.– Leslie Felperin, Hollywood ReporterWhat it is… is an honest reflection of harrowing uncertainty, broken up by moments of unbridled joy — which Akhavan captures like lightning in a bottle — as lost souls push back against a seemingly universal unfairness.– Siddhant Adlakha, Slashfilm","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"war, toy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"fight-summer-blockbuster-fatigue-with-these-acclaimed-indie-movies"},{"id":"47612043808936","title":"Certified Fresh Indie Gems You Might Have Missed In Theaters, Now Streaming","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Certified Fresh Indie Gems You Might Have Missed In Theaters, Now StreamingDo not sleep on flicks like Disobedience, Lean On Pete, and The Insult, which could sneak into awards conversations.by Jacqueline Coley | July 31, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Scott Patrick Green /© A24 )Fall is when&nbsp;indie cinema and awards chatter kicks into high gear, with the Toronto International Film Festival signaling our first look at the&nbsp;year’s likeliest awards contenders and theaters suddenly showing a slew of movies that don’t feature explosions.&nbsp;The highly competitive awards calendar usually squeezes movies that come before the fall out of contention, but there are some&nbsp;films among this group that you should keep an eye on – and that are available on streaming right now. (It’s hot out anyway, and you were looking for an excuse to stay in, right?) Check out these Certified Fresh indie gems you shouldn’t let fly under your radar.&nbsp;The Insult (L'insulte) (2018)  86%What happens when a minor offense spirals out of control.&nbsp;That is the question that Ziad Doueiri’s The Insult&nbsp;asks and the brilliantly answers.&nbsp;A simple splash of dirty water morphs into a sensational courtroom drama that threatens to divide a country.&nbsp;The fact the two male leads&nbsp;sit&nbsp;on opposite sides of the political and religious divide in Lebanon further heightens the tension:&nbsp;Tony is a right-wing Christian and Salameh’s a Palestinian.&nbsp;Katie Walsh of Tribune News Service called The Insult, “A powerful and impeccably crafted tale arguing for the crucial importance of addressing history and facing down trauma.”The Death of Stalin (2018)  95%Armando Iannucci, the creator and writer of The Thick of It and&nbsp;Veep, is a master of political satire.&nbsp;Earlier this year, Iannucci’s The Death of Stalin&nbsp;made its way into theaters with a stellar cast including Steve Buscemi, Jason Issacs, and Andrea Riseborough, and a story that chronicled&nbsp;the death of Joesph Stalin and the&nbsp;power struggle that followed in its wake. Adam Graham from Detroit News called it a “deep farce,&nbsp;but it is rooted in enough political reality that it hardly feels sensationalized.”&nbsp;Unsane (2018)  80%Steven Soderbergh returned from his self-imposed retirement completely recommitted to independent filmmaking.&nbsp;After The Knick was canceled he quickly returned to theaters with his redneck Ocean’s Eleven, Logan Lucky, and&nbsp;followed it up with&nbsp;avant-garde thriller&nbsp;Unsane.&nbsp;Claire Foy stars as Sawyer, a young woman who is&nbsp;involuntarily committed to a mental institution and who spends the movie’s runtime&nbsp;questioning what’s real and what’s a product of her delusion. The movie was shot entirely on an iPhone and the hype around the technical achievement may have overshadowed the quality of the film (trust us: it’s really good).&nbsp;Julian Wood of FILMINK reminded us to not let the marketing distract from the power of Soderbergh’s work,&nbsp;writing that the “iPhone opus is a worthy addition to the longstanding but problematic mental health thriller subgenre.”&nbsp;Chappaquiddick (2018)  81%John Curran’s Chappaquiddick was an unfortunate victim of miscalculation and lousy timing.&nbsp;Originally slated to premiere last fall with an awards season push, Entertainment Studios swapped the date for Chappaquiddick for&nbsp;Hostiles, starring Christian Bale.&nbsp;Neither would go on to make much money, or much of an awards-season splash. Which is a shame because both are worthy of attention.&nbsp;In this fictional retelling of Edward Kennedy’s Chappaquiddick scandal, Jason Clarke perfectly embodies the younger iteration of the man who would become the Lion of the Senate.&nbsp;Stephanie Zacharek of TIME Magazine wrote, “Clarke makes us feel plenty of things we’d rather not.&nbsp;His eyes are shadowed with profound decency one minute and hollowed out in the desperate calculation the next.”&nbsp;Lean on Pete (2018)  90%Here we’re going to make an impassioned plea for everyone to see this&nbsp;story about a boy and his horse. At 17,&nbsp;Charlie Plummer read the script for Lean on Pete and sent a letter to the director, Andrew Haigh, expressing his passion for the project; after a few minutes watching him on screen as Charley you’d have trouble imagining anyone else in the role.&nbsp;Charley struggles through hardship but finds belonging and friendship while caring for an aging racehorse named Lean On Pete; the movie follows his journey to find a home for the both of them. Expect to be moved.&nbsp;Danny Leigh of&nbsp;The Financial Times likened Lean On Pete to “Dickens, under a starry and menacing American sky.”Disobedience (2018)  84%A trio of Certified Fresh films centered on the Hasidic branch of Judaism premiered in 2017: Menashe, One of Us, and Disobedience.&nbsp;In his follow up to the Academy Award-winning A Fantastic Woman, Sebastián Lelio directs Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams as two Jewish women who reconnect and fall back in love.&nbsp;An initial childhood affair between the two results in Ronit’s (Weisz) banishment and Esti’s (McAdams) marriage to Dovid, their childhood friend and rabbinical protege.&nbsp;Upon the death of Ronit’s father, she returns to London and her feelings for Esti are rekindled, placing Esti in the difficult position of choosing between her faith and her one true love.&nbsp;David Ehrlich of Indiewire praised both Weisz and McAdams, calling the film a “fraught and emotionally nuanced love story about the tension between the life we’re born into and the one we want for ourselves.”Gemini (2018)  72%Hollywood noir gets a post-millennial update in Gemini.&nbsp;A young starlet’s (Zoe Kravitz) personal assistant (Lola Kirke) is tasked with solving a crime while she staves off an equally clever police detective (John Cho).&nbsp;Aaron Katz has been delivering consistently entertaining arthouse cinema for years now, but has yet to&nbsp;get much&nbsp;attention for his work outside of the festival circuit.&nbsp;The&nbsp;LA backdrop he creates here is tinted and reimagined, and the suspenseful story plays out as if behind a stylish Instagram filter.&nbsp;Not every aspect of the film lands quite so well as the look,&nbsp;but Kirke delivers a standout performance.&nbsp;Jesse Hassenger from the AV Club said: “As visually appealing as much of Gemini is, it wouldn’t work nearly so well without Lola Kirke playing Jill.”&nbsp;Revenge (2018)  93%Revenge is the type of film that happens when you point the female gaze squarely at the revenge genre, and aim to make something as bloody as possible, and mad as hell.&nbsp;Jen (Matilda Lutz) is enjoying a romantic getaway with her boyfriend when a series of events (that we don’t want to spoil) leaves her for&nbsp;dead.&nbsp;Jen miraculously survives and embarks on a no-holds-barred assault to reap furiously unrelenting wrath upon her attackers.&nbsp;In her debut film, Coralie Fargeat marries Mad Max landscapes with Tarantino-style action for sensational and disturbing results.&nbsp;Kristy Puchko of Riot Material called Fargeat’s debut “a jaw-dropping thriller that’s both nail-bitingly brutal and fiercely feminist.”The Rider (2018)  97%Chloé Zhao is incomparable when comes to sculpting raw talent.&nbsp;For the follow up to her impressive debut, Songs My Brothers Taught Me,&nbsp;she again enlisted amateur or first-time actors.&nbsp;Under her direction, these novice performers portray their characters so authentically that you might mistake this fictionalized true story&nbsp;for&nbsp;a documentary.&nbsp;Writer and director Zhao met Brady Jandreau during Songs My Brothers Taught Me and wanted to cast him.&nbsp;After an accident left him with life-changing head injuries, she decided to base the script for her next film on his story;&nbsp;Jandreau adds depth and emotion to this poignant western.&nbsp;Chandler Levak of The Globe commended Jandreau: “[He] disappears into a role largely based on his own experiences, oozing empathy from his pores.”","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"of, chucky, motion, Spectrum, on, DC, The, Warner, doctor, drama, school","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"certified-fresh-indie-gems-you-might-have-missed-in-theaters-now-streaming"},{"id":"47612152976571","title":"Ewan McGregor in Talks for Disney+ Obi-Wan Kenobi Star Wars Series","content":"TV Talkvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ewan McGregor in Talks for Disney+ Obi-Wan Kenobi Star Wars SeriesPlus: trailers for Bourne-universe series Treadstone and American Horror Story: 1984, an NBCUniversal streaming service update, and casting news.by Jean Bentley | August 16, 2019 |  CommentsThis week in TV news includes a major Star Wars story, new trailers, a Hemingway adaptation, and plenty of casting news.Ewan McGregor is in talks to reprise his role as a younger version of Obi-Wan Kenobi in a potential event series for Disney+.

An organization made up of film enthusiasts, industry professionals, academics, and filmmakers, the NBR’s is one of the first winners lists announced in 2018, quickly following Monday night’s Gotham Awards. Breaking from The Gothams’ and The Independent Spirit Awards’ smaller film focus, the National Board Review voting body favored studio awards features, with A Star is Born and Green Book sweeping the top categories&nbsp;– the latter was voted the Best Film of 2018. Last year, The Post swept the top awards categories but was shut out come Oscar night. Additionally, big winners The Shape of Water and Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri were omitted entirely from the NBR picks, so exercise caution in placing too&nbsp;much stock in today’s list for Oscar indictions.

It’s the last in a trilogy of films based on author Jenny Han’s young adult novels, which follow the starry-eyed Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor) as she accidentally — and then on purpose — falls in love with her perfect suitor (or, at least as perfect as a high school relationship can be).The films are extremely popular. The first two, which were released in 2018 and 2020, have respective Tomatometer scores of 96% and 75% and are both Certified Fresh. Fans became obsessed with Yakult, the so-called&nbsp;“Korean yogurt smoothie” that Lara Jean and her family drink in the films, and they especially became captivated with Noah Centineo, the actor who plays love interest Peter Kavinsky. In doing this, To All the Boys has followed in the tradition of other rom-coms – some of which it actually references, like Always and Forever’s re-creation of John Cusack’s boom box moment from 1989’s Say Anything … – in crossing the line from being a sweet flick to an endearing part of pop-culture canon.(Photo by Katie Yu/Netflix)“I think that people crave conflict, but not too much conflict.”But why are some rom-coms so addictive?“I think that people crave conflict, but not too much conflict,”&nbsp;Han says. “When the outside world is so tumultuous, people don’t necessarily want to be stressed out when they’re watching a movie, and they have a couple of hours just to relax… Because, ultimately, regardless of whether the two people get together in the end — which they usually do, but not always — you know that it’s still going to be like an optimistic ending.”This is further confounding because these movies’ viewpoint is diametrically opposed to the way more people have reportedly begun to feel about monogamy. Marriage rates have been dropping for years for a number of reasons and a pre-coronavirus report from the Pew Research Center&nbsp;found that “fewer than one-in-five U.S. adults say being married is essential for a man or a woman to live a fulfilling life.”(Photo by Katie Yu/Netflix)“Rom-coms, like mainstream teen films, female friendship films, bromance films and others, are ‘feel-good films.'”And yet, just because people are more woke to the complexities of modern-day relationships doesn’t mean that they haven’t traditionally been eager to watch something light and fun.“The rom-com has a long history in Hollywood back to the screwball comedies of the 1930s, the sex comedies of the 1950s, the anxious rom-coms of the 1970s and the nostalgic rom-coms of the 1980s and ‘90s,” says Shelley Cobb, an associate professor of film at England’s University of Southampton and a feminist film and media studies scholar.Cobb says that while “their popularity waxes and wanes over time” these films stick in the zeitgeist because of the promise of “the comfort of predictability, the satisfaction of a happy ending, and the comedy.”“Rom-coms, like mainstream teen films, female friendship films, bromance films and others, are ‘feel-good films,’” Cobb says, adding that “even if the relationships on screen don’t look exactly like your own, we know what it’s like to love and hate people in our lives and to be sad and be happy because of those people.”(Photo by Katie Yu/Netflix)“People have this pressure that they have to find&nbsp;the one.”But does the genre also bring with it a risk of false hope? Are some movie-goers who relate to To All the Boys’ Lara Jean raised to obsess over meet-cutes and promposals? (And then perhaps feel depressed if things don’t work out that way in real life?)Julie Spira, a Los-Angeles based matchmaker and online dating coach who runs CyberDatingExpert.com, says she still has clients who “expect me to have this digital magic wand that, you know, within three days or three weeks, they’re gonna find the one.”“People have this pressure that they have to find the one,” Spira says, adding that, especially now that we’re in a pandemic, “I’m saying you just need to expand. You need to cast a wide net. You need to expand your social circle. You need to find a pen pal; you need to find a digital pen pal. And that person is going to be a friend. And, maybe, that friendship will turn into romance. Maybe it won’t. But your life can be enriched by having a great person in your life.”It’s also helpful that the genre of romantic comedies is expanding. These films are increasingly more queer inclusive (see 2018’s&nbsp;Love, Simon&nbsp;or&nbsp;2020’s Chemical Hearts&nbsp;and Happiest Season, for example) and To All The Boys is one of many recent examples that strove for racially diverse casts.(Photo by Katie Yu/Netflix)“Singles are saying that they’re looking for a meaningful relationship, a long-term relationship, more than ever.”This series also makes a point of telling the story of a teen girl – not a couple.Michael Fimognari, who directed the second and third To All the Boys movies and was the cinematographer on the first one, says that while the films’ plots have included a love triangle and will they/won’t they dynamics, the intent of the filmmakers was always to “show the full Lara Jean Covey story” and that “it was always about her dealing with being in a real relationship.”Fimognari came to these films after a career that included a lot of horror titles – another genre that’s seen a shift in recent years – and says that “maybe, you know, 30 years ago, rom-coms could get made on the big studio level and get put out and you had [names associated with them like] John Hughes and you have these big theatrical releases with stars.” Now, he says, streaming services like Netflix have “thrived on being able to allow people to see the movie they want to see.”But does this coalesce with what the viewing public expects for its own life?Dating expert Spira says a focus on commitment-free courtships had a moment, but since COVID-19 locked people indoors, “singles are saying that they’re looking for a meaningful relationship, a long-term relationship, more than ever.”“I’m very curious to see if that will continue as things open up,” she says. “I have a feeling it will, because peoples’ brains have been rewired into thinking that they want one meaningful person to spend your life with, or at least during a crisis.”Or maybe they’ve just been stuck at home re-watching old rom-coms.On an Apple device?

Plus, news on two new seasons of Atlanta, Jessica Chastain to play Tammy Wynette, and more of the week's biggest TV and streaming news.by Jean Bentley | September 11, 2020 |  CommentsJust because the flagship is coming to an end doesn’t mean there won’t be more of The Walking Dead: AMC has announced that there are not one but two new spin-offs in the works. Other major developments this week include an update on the production of Atlanta‘s much-delayed third season, a big new TV role for former Veronica Mars guest star Jessica Chastain,&nbsp;yet another&nbsp;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&nbsp;update, and much more.&nbsp;Read on for the biggest stories in TV and streaming from the past week.TOP STORYThe Walking Dead Gets Two New Spin-offs(Photo by Jackson Lee Davis/AMC)The Walking Dead might be ending after an expanded 11th season, but the world of the AMC hit will live on in two new spin-offs —&nbsp;including an anthology series and one based on fan favorite duo Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride).The two original cast members will return for the latter series, which was created by TWD universe boss Scott Gimple and current TWD showrunner Angela Kang and is set to premiere in 2023.“It’s bittersweet to bring The Walking Dead to an end, but I could not be more excited to be working with Scott Gimple and AMC to develop a new series for Daryl and Carol. Working with Norman Reedus and Melissa McBride has been a highlight of my career, and I’m thrilled that we get to keep telling stories together,” Kang said in a statement announcing the news.The second spin-off, Tales of the Walking Dead, is an anthology that will allow the franchise to dig into the backstories of existing characters, introduce new ones, and tell new stories in the world in standalone episodes or arcs.McBride said in a statement that she’s thrilled she’ll get to explore the “Caryl” dynamic further in a spin-off with Reedus, her fellow original cast member.“Their shared history is long, and each’s own personal fight to survive, even longer — the more obvious aspect of what has kept them close and loyal,” she wrote. “But there is also a rather mysterious aspect to their fondness for one another that I enjoy, and their playfulness when the world permits.”Reedus’ statement was similar, singling out his character’s unique relationship with Carol.“Daryl’s relationship with Carol has always been my favorite relationship on the show — sorry, Rick. I love the way these characters interact and relate to each other on so many levels and can’t wait to see where their ride goes from here.”Atlanta Season 3 Is Delayed Again —&nbsp;But There’s Good News, Too(Photo by Guy D'Alema/FX)Fans of Donald Glover‘s groundbreaking comedy Atlanta are no stranger to delays —&nbsp;the second season premiered a full two years after the first —&nbsp;but the planned third season, which was supposed to film in 2020 and premiere in early 2021, has been pushed to an undetermined date thanks to COVID-19.There’s good news, though: Because of the delay, Glover and his writing team have written all of season 3 —&nbsp;and all of season 4, too.FX Networks chairman John Landgraf told reporters on Wednesday that the complications have come from scheduling all of the series’ in-demand stars, including Brian Tyree Henry, LaKeith Stanfield, and Zazie Beetz.“One of the things that’s been an unexpected boon from COVID-19 is that writers have had a lot of time to write,” Landgraf said. “However, the availability [of actors] has been pushed back because of the [pandemic].The third season will take place mainly in Europe, as Henry’s Al and Glover’s Earn flew overseas for a tour at the end of season 2, but season 4 is set back in Atlanta. The current production plan will see both seasons filmed concurrently — 10 episodes for season 3 and eight for season 4 — so they’ll both be in the can for future premiere dates.Game Shows Are Back on TBSOoooh baby, guess who’s the new host of @Wipeout on @tbsnetwork? pic.twitter.com/YKVvYrzzy8— nicole byer (@nicolebyer) September 10, 2020TBS is going really, really big with Go-Big Show, its new hourlong “extreme talent competition” featuring “monster trucks, alligator trainers, stunt archery and other radical feats, the program celebrates daring acts alongside personal, behind-the-scenes stories from the challengers as they battle head-to-head to impress the judges and advance toward the finale’s ultimate $100,000 prize.”Celebrity judges include Snoop Dogg, Rosario Dawson, Jennifer Nettles, and “The American Nightmare” Cody, and the series is hosted by comedian Bert Kreischer.

The duo will provide commentary as contestants complete the series’ trademark wacky obstacle courses (big balls included), with Camille Kostek acting as field reporter.The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, but SeriousThe upcoming original cast reunion isn’t the only new Fresh Prince of Bel-Air content headed to TV: Will Smith announced this week that Peacock has ordered two seasons of a dramatic reboot called Bel-Air.According to Peacock, the new series is a “serialized one-hour dramatic analogue of the ’90s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air that leans into the original premise: Will’s complicated journey from the streets of West Philadelphia to the gated mansions of Bel-Air. With a reimagined vision, Bel-Air will dive deeper into the inherent conflicts, emotions and biases that were impossible to fully explore in a 30-minute sitcom format, while still delivering swagger and nods to the original show.”And it’s all based on a viral parody trailer from Morgan Cooper, who will also direct, co-write, and co-executive produce alongside showrunner Chris Collins.The CW, Freeform, and Kal Penn Want the Youths to VoteFreeform has teamed up with Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle&nbsp;star (and former Barack Obama White House staffer) Kal Penn for a new unscripted series, Kal Penn Approves This Message, that will help reach out to Millennial and Gen Z voters.

But after careful consideration, we here at RT have narrowed down our picks for who will win – as well as who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win&nbsp;– in&nbsp;all 24 categories. We looked to our Awards Leaderboard and the Tomatometer for guidance, along with historical voting patterns, the state of the conversation right now, and insights from the Rotten Tomatoes staff — which is why our staff predictions in a couple of the categories differ from the recommendations in the video above. Don’t agree with our picks?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments.Follow us on social all day Sunday, February 24th for reactions, and check back with Rotten Tomatoes&nbsp;after the ceremony to hear our take on memorable moments, and the biggest snubs and surprises.Best Picture(Photo by @ Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;Win?Roma (2018)  95%What should&nbsp;win?The reigning champion of our Awards Leaderboard is also our pick to win it all. Everyone at RT agreed that Alfonso Cuarón’s semi-autobiographical period piece deserved the honor. With high-profile Academy members like Steven Spielberg still criticizing the streaming giant for competing for an Academy Award, let alone&nbsp;winning&nbsp;one, a late-season shocker&nbsp;could&nbsp;happen, but our money is still on Cuarón’s masterpiece.Best Actor(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Who&nbsp;will win?Rami Malek – Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)  60%Who&nbsp;should win?After wins at the SAGs, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes, Rami Malek has run away with the season, despite the fact that Bohemian Rhapsody&nbsp;has&nbsp;the lowest Tomatometer score of any film nominated in the top five categories. The Mr. Robot actor’s turn as Queen’s late frontman Freddie Mercury has eclipsed early front runner Christian Bale’s performance as former Vice-President Dick Cheney. We do agree Bale&nbsp;should&nbsp;be the one to win on Sunday, but history and momentum tells us that’s not likely.Best Actress(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Glenn Close – The Wife (2018)  86%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?To paraphrase a quote from her fourth Oscar-nominated performance in&nbsp;Fatal Attraction: “Glenn Close is not gonna be ignored.” After a surprise win and moving speech at the Golden Globes in January, there has been nothing stopping Glenn Close on the road to her seventh Oscar nomination and likely her first win. Adding a SAG win for Lead Actress has helped her pull away from early favorite Lady Gaga, with whom she tied at the Critics Choice Awards. In our staff discussion, there was much praise for Gaga’s take on the role played by Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand,&nbsp;but we ultimately voted that Close also&nbsp;deserved&nbsp;to win, for her entire career (which we&nbsp;chronicled in a extended chat with her earlier this year) as much as for what she did in&nbsp;The Wife.Best Supporting Actor(Photo by @ Universal Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Mahershala Ali – Green Book (2018)  77%Who&nbsp;should win?Firmly in the driver’s seat for the award season, Academy Awards winner Mahershala Ali is most likely going to win another golden statue. Green Book has had a bumpy road, but the nonsensical gaffes, Twitter apologies, and accusations of historical inaccuracy have&nbsp;had little effect on Ali’s Oscar chances. A clean sweep of the major awards (BAFTA, HFPA, Critics Choice, SAG) makes him our pick to win.&nbsp;In discussions, however, nearly our entire staff agreed that Richard E. Grant&nbsp;should&nbsp;be crowned instead. After 32 years as a working actor, Grant has melted our collective hearts with his childlike glee&nbsp;during the grueling campaign season. When we sat down with him last year to chat about the nomination, we noted how humbled he was to be in contention for his work in&nbsp;Can You Ever Forgive Me?,&nbsp;and that just makes him all the more deserving.Best Supporting Actress(Photo by @ Annapurna Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Regina King – If Beale Street Could Talk (2019)  95%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?It is good to be the King. While at the Oscar nominee luncheon earlier this month, Regina King was noticeably popular&nbsp;among her fellow nominees. (The loudest applause breaks were for her and Mahershala Ali, as they walked to stage for the iconic Oscar class photo.) As Sharon in Barry Jenkins’&nbsp;If Beale Street Could Talk, she embodied the best of what a mother should be while&nbsp;simultaneously breaking our hearts with her tear-wrenching performance. The BAFTA and SAG snubs had us concerned, and there was more than a little love for Rachel Weisz in&nbsp;The Favourite among RT staff,&nbsp;but in the end, Regina is winning – as she&nbsp;should.&nbsp;And we have been saying as much since our&nbsp;interview last year.Best Director(Photo by Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Alfonso Cuarón – Roma (2018)  95%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Why did it take so long for the Academy to nominate Spike Lee for Best Director? We may never know.&nbsp;In the end, it was BlacKkKlansman, not Do The Right Thing or Malcolm X, for which the Brooklyn director finally got his due.&nbsp;Thought-provoking and hilarious, the 1970s-set buddy cop tale of a Black police officer infiltrating the KKK has provided Lee with his best reviews since&nbsp;Inside Man.&nbsp;Everyone at RT agreed Lee&nbsp;should’ve&nbsp;won long ago, and we’re glad to see him finally recognized in this category, but this year Alfonso Cuarón is&nbsp;winning for Roma, as he&nbsp;should,&nbsp;no question.Best Original Screenplay(Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/Fox Seachlight Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Deborah Davis, Tony McNamara – The Favourite (2018)  93%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?In a surprise late-season surge, The Favourite emerged as our pick for&nbsp;Best Original Screenplay. Losing at the WGA Awards to Eighth Grade dampened the hopes of Oscar nominees Green Book, Roma, and Vice. As The Favourite was deemed ineligible by the WGA, a surprise win by Bo Burnham’s debut&nbsp;screenplay, effectively crowned Yorgos&nbsp;Lanthimos’ period dramedy as the one to beat. As far as who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win, RT staff agreed with the writers guild. We thought&nbsp;Eighth Grade&nbsp;should&nbsp;be vying for the Oscar – it&nbsp;should win – and we’re still heartbroken that it isn’t.Best Adapted Screenplay(Photo by Focus Features)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott, Spike Lee –&nbsp;BlacKkKlansman (2018)  96%Who&nbsp;should win?We predicted Spike Lee would fall short of the Best Director Oscar, but the Academy is likely to make up for it here. For all the reasons we said earlier, Spike should get his long overdue Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. We also thought that it was a shame, however, because that meant Barry Jenkins would lose. We all agreed Spike will win but we were split 50-50 on who should between Jenkins or Lee.Animated Feature(Photo by Sony Pictures Animation)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)  97%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Another near-unanimous vote. We picked&nbsp;Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse&nbsp;as the best Animated film of 2018. It should win and we think it will.Documentary Feature(Photo by National Geographic Documentary Films)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Free Solo (2018)  97%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?A staff viewing of&nbsp;Free Solo, the tale of an elite climber who attempts a “free climb” (no ropes or nets) on Yosemite’s El Capitan,&nbsp;sealed it for most of us. On pace to be the highest grossing documentary of the year, it’s our pick to walk home with a golden statuette. RBG has its fans in the Academy, but&nbsp;Free Solo&nbsp;is the kind of doc that leaves you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. That said, we are still stunned the Mr. Rogers biodoc&nbsp;Won’t You Be My Neighbor?&nbsp;failed to gain a nod. We still think it was the best doc from last year, and it’s our pick for what&nbsp;should&nbsp;win – despite the fact the Academy snubbed it.Foreign Language(Photo by Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Roma (2018)  95%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Roma. We are more certain of this win than Best Picture. Even if the Netflix naysayers win out in the Best Picture race, they have little chance of shaking Cuarón’s hold on this one.Original Score(Photo by Annapurna Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Nicholas Britell – If Beale Street Could Talk (2019)  95%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Justin Hurwitz’s snub for First Man left the door wide open for Nicholas Britell’s score, one we all agreed was haunting and brilliant. It should and will beat the others; including the Black Panther score, which also had its defenders among the RT staff.Original Song(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?“Shallow” by&nbsp; Lady Gaga &amp; Bradley Cooper – A Star Is Born (2018)  90%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?“HAAA AH AH AH AAAH” We’re off the deep end, watch Gaga will win. There’s no chance she’s losing now!In all seriousness, Laga Gaga has won every contest this year for her and Bradley Cooper’s mega-hit “Shallow.” Our only pick for&nbsp;A Star is Born is also the strongest pick we have on the ballot.Sound Editing(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer/Paramount )Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?A Quiet Place (2018)  96%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?With a premise that relied on silence — and the occasional interruption of that silence — A Quiet Place only worked as well as it did because of its top-notch sound editing, which was essential for heightening the terror of the horror hit. There was also a ton of love for First Man&nbsp;at RT, but the Academy has been fairly resounding in its rejection of the Neil Armstrong biopic. We&nbsp;agree it’s more technologically impressive and&nbsp;should&nbsp;win, but sadly won’t.Sound Mixing(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)  60%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Our staff (all of&nbsp;whom can correctly describe the difference between Sound Mixing and Sound Editing) had to admit, what was done in Bohemian Rhapsody was exceptional. Taking home the top prizes at both the sound guilds early this month only further confirmed it as our pick&nbsp;for what will and&nbsp;should win.Makeup and Hairstyling(Photo by Annapurna Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Vice (2018)  65%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Like Gary Oldman last year in&nbsp;Darkest Hour, Christian Bale was unrecognizable as Dick Cheney in Vice – due in large part to the exceptional make-up. So, just as Darkest Hour won last year, we predict&nbsp;Vice will take it this year. We adored Border’s makeup&nbsp;as well and think it should win, but the modern-day ‘fairy-tale’ has&nbsp;little chance of beating Vice.Costume Design(Photo by Yorgos Lanthimos/Fox Searchlight Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?The Favourite (2018)  93%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?We will be the first to cheer if our pick for Best Costume Design is wrong, as we think Black Panther and Ruth E. Carter should win. But Sandy Powell is nominated twice for The Favourite and Mary Poppins Returns.&nbsp;Couple that brag-worthy achievement with the Academy’s history of picking period costumes over fantasy, and&nbsp;The Favourite&nbsp;is the safer bet.Cinematography(Photo by Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Roma (2018)  95%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Roma again. If a black-and-white movie feels rich and vibrant, it’s usually due to one thing: world-class cinematography. Roma will add to its accolades as the one that should and will win for Best Cinematography.Production Design(Photo by Marvel Studios)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Black Panther (2018)  96%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Our only pick for Black Panther&nbsp;comes in Production Design, as Hannah Beachler has swept the guilds and critics associations. The throne room in Wakanda alone puts her above all other contenders&nbsp;as the one to who should and will win.Film Editing(Photo by Alex Bailey/20th Century Fox)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)  60%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?We predict another win for Bohemian Rhapsody, which brings the unconventional Oscar contender’s total to three — the tight editing of its Live Aid sequence is unmatched. Though we agreed Spike Lee’s longtime editor, Barry Alexander Brown, who is enjoying his first nomination,&nbsp;should take home the prize, Bohemian Rhapsody is the hands-down favorite.Visual Effects(Photo by Marvel Studios)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Avengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?One day, we will be able to honor&nbsp;motion-capture performances with an Oscar. Until then, we’ll have to settle for a visual effects Oscar for what Josh Brolin did as Thanos in&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War.&nbsp;Avengers is taking it, as we think it should. It’s worth noting that the very influential Steven Spielberg helmed Ready Player One, and his pedigree may sway voters (plenty of our staff picked it), but the majority voted for the first part of the Russo brothers’ Marvel epic.The Shorts(Photo by Netflix)For this section we relied on the truly obsessive members of our staff who has seen all (or most of the shorts). These are their picks and likely your&nbsp;best bet if you haven’t seen any of them.Documentary Short –&nbsp;Period.

Fan favorite Bohemian Rhapsody was a big winner, taking home four trophies, including a Best Actor win for star Rami Malek. But it was Peter Farrelly’s Green Book and Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma that came away with the highest honors — the former took Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, and and Best Original Screenplay, while the latter took Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Foreign Language Film. Another massively popular film, Black Panther, also scored three wins, including historic wins for costume designer Ruth E.

But for now the focus is a series set in the fictional African country, which is also the focus for the Black Panther sequel movie Coogler is currently at work on.The Wakanda series would be the latest in a long line of Marvel series coming to Disney+.

(Variety)George Clooney May Star in Buck Rogers Reboot Series(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)George Clooney and his Smokehouse production company partner, Grant Heslov, have joined with Brian K. Vaughn for a reboot of the 1979-81 Gil Gerard and Erin Gray sci-fi drama series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. All three will serve as executive producers on the project, and Clooney may star in the title role, if Legendary TV has its way, according to The Wrap. Meanwhile, if the series is a hit, Legendary could move forward with a Buck Rogers movie and an anime series spin-off,&nbsp;THR.com reports.There is a potential glitch in the plan to launch a new Buck Rogers universe. The trust that oversees the Buck Rogers estate sent a cease-and-desist letter to Legendary, Deadline reports, informing Legendary that the trust already has an agreement with Skydance Productions — home of Top Gun: Maverick, the most recent Star Trek films, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, and Terminator: Dark Fate — to “exploit the property” of Buck Rogers.Related: Nominations for 2021’s Golden Globes, SAG AwardsPBS Preview: Hemingway, My Grandparents’ War, and The Black Church — Plus, More Miss Scarlet?&nbsp;(Photo by PBS)PBS presented previews of its upcoming 2021 programming for TV critics this week in a virtual Television Critics Association winter press tour, and there’s plenty coming. For starters, Masterpiece executive producer Susanne Simpson teased that although she doesn’t have any official announcements about a potential second season of the currently airing Miss Scarlet and the Duke, that fans should “wait for it —&nbsp;we’ll have something soon, I think.” She also highlighted the eclectic nature of Masterpiece’s 50th anniversary.“One of the things we tried to do with our 50th anniversary was we tried very hard in January to really show off the different types of programs that we do. We felt it was a bit of a gift to our audience to do that on our 50th. So, we had [Elizabeth Is Missing&nbsp;with] Glenda Jackson, who obviously is one of the top actors of our time, so we wanted to tell everybody we’re still showing off acting royalty in Masterpiece. We have All Creatures Great and Small&nbsp;— that’s a very heartwarming show for a family audience. I think Miss Scarlet and the Duke is terrific, because it’s a woman character that’s very feisty for her time and kind of fighting off roadblocks. And then we have The Long Song, which is a really important show, very powerful, very moving.”Other highlights from the public broadcaster’s upcoming slate: Hemingway, the latest from Ken Burns and Lynn Novick featuring narration from Jeff Daniels as the famous writer and attempts to deconstruct Hemingway’s hyper-masculine image: “I think the persona of the wild man, the drunk, the bar guy, the big game hunter, the big sea fisherman is what we inherit, the baggage we carry. But almost immediately we began to see how thin and frail that was, not just for him but in fact,” Burns said.The upcoming My Grandparents’ War features stars Helena Bonham Carter, Mark Rylance, Carey Mulligan, and Kristin Scott Thomas as they trace the journeys of their grandparents during World War II, and Bonham Carter, whose family history is traced in the season premiere, said the experience helped her learn about her grandparents in a more intimate way.“I had a vague approximation, myths almost, of both my grandparents that we followed. This just filled in a lot of the detail and bought them very vividly to me,” she said. “Violet, my grandmother, I would have been her age when the Second World War happened. So I met them almost as peers. It was really extraordinary.”The two-part documentary The Black Church: This Is Our Story, This Is Our Song from Henry Louis Gates Jr. traces the history of the Black church in America through historical figures and contemporary celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, John Legend and Jennifer Hudson. Said Gates: “We wanted to make a series about the sheer transcendent power of belief, and never has that message been more important than now.”NEW TRAILERS: Maggie Returns to The Walking DeadIn the bonus episodes of The Walking Dead’s 10th and penultimate season, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) returns, which almost certainly means she’s going to have an issue with Negan’s (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) new role among her group of friends.

Night Shyamalan and&nbsp;Servant&nbsp;Cast Provide New Details on Scary New Apple TV+ Series(Photo by Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for ReedPOP)Apple TV+ has released teasers for its upcoming M. Night Shyamalan thriller series, Servant. The first two were&nbsp;unnerving in different ways:&nbsp;The first, “The Rocker,” features a baby rocking in front of a TV (happy enough, but set to some traditional horror movie sounds). The second, “Cricket,” features the sound of a ticking clock as a woman sees a cricket while brushing her teeth — “something bad [is] coming,” a voiceover warns. Apparently, it’s coming on November 28, when the series premieres on the streaming service.A third teaser, “Solitude” (above), debuted at the series’ New York Comic-Con panel on Thursday night. It features a brightly lit, sterile-feeling shot of a suspiciously still newborn baby being changed. The spot features&nbsp;an unnerving aesthetic from Shyamalan, who announced the late November premiere date during the panel — just in time to terrify your family after eating way too much turkey at Thanksgiving dinner — and revealed the first real details about the series.Servant&nbsp;follows a Philadelphia couple in mourning after an “unspeakable tragedy creates a rift in their marriage and opens the door for a mysterious force to enter their home,” according to the official description.&nbsp;Lauren Ambrose and Toby Kebbell play the well-off suburban Philadelphia couple at the center of the story, and creepy things start happening when they hire a new babysitter (Nell Tiger Free) to take care of their infant, according to a CBR.com report. Rupert Grint plays the “brash, outspoken, and blunt” brother of Ambrose’s character. The entire series will feature just those four characters and will take place in the couple’s home.Shyamalan executive produces and directs two episodes of the series alongside creator and writer Tony Basgallop.

We’ve got to let her go.”Another place we’re expecting her to revisit the role: On Saturday, when she hosts SNL for the first time. Come on, don’t you think a filmed Fleabag skit is happening?

I really enjoyed). I have almost no doubt based on his coy evasiveness that he will be in the Obi Wan Disney+ series. I’ve seen many an actor playfully evade. I’m placing a big bet that Owen will be back.— Josh Horowitz (@joshuahorowitz) October 1, 2019The upcoming Obi Wan Kenobi Disney+ series could see another face familiar to the Star Wars universe: Joel Edgerton. When asked whether he could reprise his role as Owen Lars, the adoptive father of baby Luke Skywalker first introduced in Attack of the Clones and who was entrusted with baby Luke after Padme’s death in Revenge of the Sith, Egerton was “coy.”“Evasiveness definitely feels like a confirmation by default, or at least a hint that Edgerton has at least been in talks with Lucasfilm and Disney,”&nbsp;/Film speculated.

Other films with impressive showings include&nbsp;The Death of Stalin,&nbsp;God’s Own Country,&nbsp;I Am Not a Witch, and&nbsp;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.&nbsp;The BIFA awards will be handed out on Sunday, December 10.&nbsp;Best British Independent FilmThe Death of Stalin 95%God's Own Country 98%I Am Not a Witch 96%Lady Macbeth 88%Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 90%Best DirectorArmando IannucciThe Death of Stalin 95%Francis LeeGod's Own Country 98%Rungano NyoniI Am Not a Witch 96%Alice BirchLady Macbeth 88%Martin McDonaghThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 90%Best ScreenplayArmando Iannucci &amp; David Schneider &amp; Ian MartinThe Death of Stalin 95%Francis LeeGod's Own Country 98%Rungano NyoniI Am Not a Witch 96%Alice BirchLady Macbeth 88%Martin McDonaghThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 90%Best ActorJamie BellFilm Stars Don’t Die in LiverpoolJosh O'ConnorGod’s Own CountryAlec SecareanuGod’s Own CountryJohnny HarrisJawbonePaddy ConsidineJourneynanBest ActressEmily BeechamDaphneRuth WilsonDark RiverMaggie MulubwaI Am Not A WitchFlorence PughLady MacbethFrances McDormandThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, MissouriBest Supporting ActorSteve BuscemiThe Death of StalinSimon Russell BealeThe Death of StalinIan HartGod’s Own CountrWoody HarrelsonThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, MissouriSam RockwellThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, MissouriBest Supporting ActressAndrea RiseboroughThe Death of StalinJulie WaltersFilm Stars Don’t Die in LiverpoolKelly MacdonaldGoodbye Christopher RobinNaomi AckieLady MacbethPatricia ClarksonThe PartyMost Promising NewcomerHarry MichellChubby FunHarry GilbyJust CharlieCosmo JarvisLady MacbethNaomi AckieLady MacbethLily NewmarkPin CushionThe Douglas Hickox Award (Debut Director)Francis LeeGod's Own Country 98%Rungano NyoniI Am Not a Witch 96%Thomas NapperJawbone 96%William OldroydLady Macbeth 88%Deborah HaywoodPin Cushion 90%Breakthrough ProducerBrendan Mullin &amp; Katy JacksonBad Day for the Cut 92%Jack Tarling &amp; Manon ArdissonGod's Own Country 98%Emily MorganI Am Not a Witch 96%Fodhla Cronin O’ReillyLady Macbeth 88%Gavin HumphriesPin Cushion 90%Best Debut ScreenwriterFancis LeeGod's Own Country 98%Rungano NyoniI Am Not a Witch 96%Johnny HarrisJawbone 96%Alice BirchLady Macbeth 88%Gaby ChiappeTheir Finest 90%The Discovery AwardEven When I Fall 100%HalfwayIn Another LifeIsolaniMy Pure Land 94%Best DocumentaryAlmost HeavenHalf WayKingdom of Us 100%Uncle Howard 91%Williams 93%Best International Independent FilmThe Florida Project 96%Get Out 98%I Am Not Your Negro 99%The Square 85%The winners of the British Independent Film Awards 2017 will be announced on Sunday, Dec. 4 at Old Billingsgate in London.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Sundance, indiana, Holiday, CW, Nickelodeon, period, TV, Extras, Hear, serial, movie, television, renewed, Masterpiece","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"british-independent-nominations-announced-lady-macbeth-dominates-with-15-noms"},{"id":"47612381916389","title":"Best Movies Off the Radar 2017","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Best Movies Off the Radar 2017A selection of 12 staff favorites that might not have played at your local multiplex.by RT Staff | December 28, 2017 |  CommentsThere are a lot — and we mean a lot — of movies that are released during any given year, and with all the marketing money going to big budget blockbusters and awards hopefuls, a lot of smaller films come and go without eliciting so much as a curious glance from moviegoers. With that in mind, we here at RT have picked just a handful of our favorite movies that were, for one reason or another,&nbsp;mostly overlooked by audiences at large this year. From carnivorous Polish mermaids and stray cats in Turkey to bombastic action in India and supernatural horror in Norway, here are some of the best movies of 2017 that you&nbsp;might not have seen.American Fable (2017)  75%Yes, there is a faun in American Fable (not a spoiler, you can see it in the trailer and the movie’s poster), and the story is told from the point of view of a young girl, but don’t be too quick to write it off as a Guilllermo del Toro knockoff. Gitty is the eleven year old protagonist of this film, and her life is pretty inauspicious and carefree, despite the palpable tension within her family. Then she comes upon a man in business attire, imprisoned in an abandoned silo on the family’s ailing farm. City meeting country is a common motif in horror films, but American Fable isn’t quite a horror, and writer-director Anne Hamilton manages to create a moody, enigmatic, and mysterious world that blends fairy tale with 1980s rural America. American Fable is the rare young girl’s coming-of-age film that doesn’t involve romance, where the growing up comes from gaining a greater understanding of the world around her and the many-faceted people who inhabit it. While the story may not pay off for all viewers, it’s still a striking, hypnotic representation of a point of view and a part of America that is often overlooked.&nbsp;I would be hesitant to call American Fable one of the best films of the year, but it is one of those films that you come away from in anticipation of what the director will accomplish in future endeavors. —&nbsp;Sara AtaiiyanAvailable on:&nbsp;Amazon, NetflixBaahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017)  86%Baahubali 2:&nbsp;The Conclusion plays like a shotgun wedding between Ben Hur&nbsp;and Kung Fu Hustle, seasoned with bits of Shakespeare, Kurosawa, and Buster Keaton. In other words, it’s a blockbuster that’s both gigantic and lighter than air. The story of The Beginning&nbsp;was as simple as a fairy tale and as resonant as a myth, but with The Conclusion, director S.S. Rajamouli has cranked everything to 11; rarely have action sequences this gravity- (and logic-) defying been captured on film. What separates this epic (which was a massive hit in India and within the South Asian diaspora) from its American brethren is its sincerity and optimism: its righteous titular hero (played by Prabhas) and his band of honorable men and women clash with scheming, corrupt bad guys, and it feels alternately old-fashioned and refreshingly bold. It’s the kind of film that reminds us why we love going to the movies. —&nbsp;Tim RyanAvailable on: Amazon, NetflixBirdboy: The Forgotten Children (Psiconautas, los niños olvidados) (2017)  94%2017 was a great year for animation. Pixar had Coco. Cartoon Saloon gave us the gorgeously moving The Breadwinner. At some point, there was a Boss Baby. And hidden behind them&nbsp;all was GKIDS’&nbsp;Birdboy: The Forgotten Children. Based on the Spanish graphic novel, Psiconautas, los niños olvidados, Birdboy follows four young ones as they navigate a post-ecological fall out world, and though it’s ultimately&nbsp;a coming-of-age story, that’s one of the only things it has in common with many of its animated contemporaries. It’s a haunting exploration of what happens to those left behind in society, warts and all, and the ways in which our inner selves and outer perceptions do not always align within the twisted, gorgeous landscape that surrounds us. Despite themes not often handled in animated features (including mental health issues, drug use, and sexual undertones), Birdboy finds a spark of hope amid the desolation. It’s got dashes of dark humor and a heartbreakingly beautiful finale which reminds us that, even in the darkest of times, there’s always a light that’s worth keeping alive. — Haña Lucero-ColinIn select theatersColossal (2017)  81%I can’t say it was the most obscure movie I saw this year, but Colossal was one of the most surprising. I’m constantly on the lookout for kooky stuff, so I was initially attracted by its odd premise, which essentially boils down to “a woman discovers she is psychically linked to a Kaiju.” It didn’t hurt that the woman in question was Anne Hathaway, that the supporting cast included Dan Stevens, Tim Blake Nelson, and Jason Sudeikis, and that the director was Nacho Vigalondo, who has something of a penchant for, yes, kooky stuff. But while Colossal does trade in goofy antics from time to time, there’s a real pathos at the center of the story, which sets Hathaway’s character on a path of self-examination in ways that are unexpectedly poignant and seemingly incongruous with its nutty high-concept premise. The film does stumble a bit in its attempt to deliver an “A-ha!” moment towards the end, but Hathaway is so good in her portrayal of a woman dealing with alcoholism, abuse, and the sins of her past that it was easy for me to overlook any minor quibbles. Colossal is a weird movie, and it’s not going to appeal to everyone, but it’s also a pretty effective exploration of stunted emotional maturity anchored by a phenomenal performance. And it’s got giant monsters. —&nbsp;Ryan FujitaniAvailable on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon, HuluColumbus (2017)  97%Stillness pervades Kogonada’s&nbsp;Columbus, in the steady, observant shots surveying the modernist architecture and public art that has given the city its prominent reputation among art lovers. This same impression of serenity spills over into the suspended lives of the two main characters: Jin, returning abruptly from a job abroad to watch over his comatose father, and Casey, a recent high school graduate who remains in Columbus in a self-imposed state of obligation, caring for her formerly drug-addicted mother. Their chance meeting is as natural as the relationship that follows, as the pair wanders from one architectural marvel to the next, confiding in one another but also challenging their respective inertia.&nbsp;Columbus&nbsp;poignantly depicts the difficulty of gazing inward and facing one’s fears, feelings that are particularly evident in Haley Lu Richardson’s luminous performance as Casey. Richardson’s facial nuances are a throwback from the silent era, subtly shifting from enthusiasm for the beloved buildings in her hometown to a fearful realization that she may never leave them behind. It’s this depth of emotion that makes&nbsp;Columbus&nbsp;feel like a conversation you can’t stop eavesdropping on.&nbsp;—&nbsp;Jenny JedinyAvailable on: Hulu,&nbsp;Amazon VideoThe Farthest (2017)  100%Out of all the cool stuff the movies have thrown at us this year, it hardly seems likely that one of 2017’s best limited-release films would be a documentary about the NASA nerds who launched the Voyager mission in 1977. Yet while The&nbsp;Farthest&nbsp;is definitely about space and math and stuff, it’s also about so much more: as director Emer Reynolds subtly yet persuasively makes clear, this is a group of people who overcame incredible odds — and technological constraints that may seem absurd to younger viewers — to assemble one of the most awe-inspiring quests for knowledge undertaken in all of human history. In these divided times, it’s nothing short of stirring to see a positive example of what we can do when our priorities align; when some of those NASA nerds start tearing up while looking back on the brilliantly curious spirit that fueled their life’s work, don’t be surprised if you find yourself reaching for a tissue too. —&nbsp;Jeff GilesAvailable on: Amazon, NetflixKedi (2017)  98%Ceyda Torun’s directorial debut follows the life of seven stray cats in Istanbul, a city that for centuries has lived harmoniously with the hundreds of thousands of owner-free cats who go about their business in the streets like any human. Kedi is definitely a film for cat lovers, but it’s also a treat for those who love to travel and learn about different cultures, those who are interested in History, and even those in search of&nbsp;something heartwarming to watch.Visually, Kedi is gorgeous. Torun and cinematographer Charlie Wuppermann create a beautiful portrait of the feline life, often shot from their perspective — at whisker’s height, offering a fresh picture of the city and its many peculiarities. The best part of Kedi, though, is how it depicts the very unique relationship between humans and cats in the city, something that feels almost magical to foreign eyes. There’s much to learn about cross-species respect and camaraderie from this movie, and it will most likely make you rethink the way you see the non-human citizens in the world around you. — Júlio de OliveiraAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonThe Lure (Córki dancingu) (2017)  89%Countless foreign films wash up on our collective shores each year, and as cinephiles, we pick through the flotsam and jetsam, occasionally stumbling upon some real treasures. Agnieszka Smoczynska’s The Lure is such a find from Poland. This mature fairy tale follows a pair of mermaids, Golden and Silver, who swim ashore after hearing a rock band play on the beach. They are soon employed at a nightclub, a catalyst for their grounded coming-of-age story. With musical numbers that range from large and lavish to intimate and dreamlike, The Lure introduced me to a killer pop-goth-rock soundtrack that I’ve been humming all year long. The film is colorful yet murky, with a camera that seems to float along with the action; it’s as if the mermaids brought their underwater sensibilities to the production itself. In a year of remarkable directorial debuts (Lady Bird, Get Out, Ingrid Goes West) this one still strikes me as the most confident and daring. Smoczynska has already arrived as a filmmaker, and I eagerly await to see what she bottles up next. If nothing else, I guarantee you won’t find a better Polish horror musical mermaid tale in 2017. —&nbsp;J.S. LewisAvailable on: AmazonMayhem (2017)  84%Rip and tear! For all you corporate drones out there suffering from chronic employment, here’s an antidote: Mayhem, director Joe Lynch’s jagged little pill of blood, guts, and TPS reports. Steven Yuen, having found sweet release from The Walking Dead‘s pervasive mediocrity, is now settled into a nice high-rise office as a heartless lawyer. But a virus (maybe you’re the problem, Steve) has invaded the building. So just as he’s about to be thrown into the street as the fall guy for some botched business, his coworkers devolve into uninhibited psychos lusting for cathartic sex and total carnage. Call it casualty Friday. The premise doesn’t hold up under any real scrutiny and the budget is barebones, but Mayhem‘s&nbsp;bone-breaking renegade filmmaking only needs the purpose and passion witnessed here for it to work. It’s a primal scream from your empty screen that departs with an impact. Literally. — Alex VoAvailable on: FandangoNOW,&nbsp;AmazonMommy Dead and Dearest (2017)  100%There’s been an influx of true crime docs in the last few years, but if there’s one that’s absolutely worth watching, it’s Mommy Dead and Dearest. Dee Dee, a model mother, and Gypsy, her chronically ill daughter, live what looks to be a seemingly normal life. Interviews with neighbors, doctors, family members, and Gypsy herself prove that nothing and no one are what they seem. It’s like if Hannah Montana was Mischa Barton from The Sixth Sense, but was also kind of a murderer — er, a murderer’s apprentice, if you will. (That is the most accurate description anyone will ever give you.) The story picks up in the aftermath of what looks like your standard Law and Order: SVU-type plot: Daughter meets guy online, guy convinces daughter to run away, mother stands in the way, all hell breaks loose. But once the details start to surface, a drastically different tale begins to emerge. Mommy Dead and Dearest not only provides an interesting look into the kind of toll Munchausen Syndrome by proxy takes on an individual, but also takes a deep dive into the inner workings of fraud, emotional and physical abuse, and the state of both the healthcare and criminal justice systems in the United States. —&nbsp;Zoey MooreAvailable on: FandangoNOW,&nbsp;AmazonNorman (Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer) (2017)  88%The latest by critically acclaimed director Joseph Cedar (Footnote, Beaufort) could be an ideal way to close out your year, with what quickly became my favorite Richard Gere performance yet. Gere plays Norman Oppenheimer, an aging Jewish wheeler and dealer in New York thrown into political mayhem when his new friend becomes elected Prime Minister of Israel. A classic tragic arc is made contemporarily relatable with a poignant stew — equal parts funny, heartwarming, and heartbreaking. The feeling walking out of the theater (or finishing the stream, as the case may be) is a darker one than expected at the start, and Gere somehow manages to turn one of those borderline abrasive characters that we’d often ignore in life into someone worth rooting for. — Kerr LordyganAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonThelma (2017)  93%I went into Thelma cold, only knowing that it had an intriguing poster that made me feel the same kind of fascination I felt with the VHS cover for Prom Night II (look it up, I was obsessed). Eili Harboe plays Thelma, a young woman in college who comes from a religious background. The movie is elegant and restrained, and compelled me to “solve” it. Thelma has a seizure at school, and things begin to get noticeably odd… or do they? Was I assigning value to something that meant nothing? Was this horror, sci-fi, coming-of-age, or all three? The fact that the movie takes its time to answer, while trusting the audience enough to draw some of their own conclusions, made me love it. Thelma’s journey into self-discovery is a measured kind of realistic, beautiful, and a little creepy. Watching it not only entertained me, but helped me understand how I watch films, and how wonderful moviegoing can be when you experience it rather than figure it out. —&nbsp;Grae DrakeIn select theaters","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"travel, movies, Country, Endgame, indiana, hard, Fire, Opinion, Plus, All, Musical","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"best-movies-off-the-radar-2017"},{"id":"47612431913201","title":"The 10 Scariest Horror Movies Ever","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 10 Scariest Horror Movies EverWe asked, you voted. From demonic possessions and cursed TVs to haunted hotels and killer clowns, here are movies that scared RT users the most.by RT Staff | October 29, 2020 |  CommentsIf you were poking around RT a week and a half or so ago, you might have come across a little poll we were taking on the site to try and determine the Scariest Movie Ever. Based on other lists and suggestions from the RT staff, we pulled together 40 of the scariest movies ever made and asked you to vote for the one that terrified you the most. As it happens, a British broadband service comparison website decided to conduct a science experiment to determine the same thing, and their results were… surprising, to say the least. Did Rotten Tomatoes readers agree with the findings? Read on to find out what our fans determined were the 10 Scariest Horror Movies Ever.1. The Exorcist (1973)(Photo by ©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)You may not agree&nbsp;that&nbsp;The Exorcist is the scariest movie ever, but it probably also&nbsp;isn’t much of a surprise to see it at the top of our list — with a whopping 19% of all the votes cast. William Friedkin’s adaptation of the eponymous novel about a demon-possessed child and the attempts to banish said demon became the highest-grossing R-rated horror film ever and the first to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars (it earned nine other nominations and took home two trophies). But outside of its critical and commercial bona fides, the film is well-known for the mass hysteria it inspired across the country, from protests over its controversial&nbsp;subject matter to widespread reports of nausea and fainting in the audience. Its dramatic pacing and somewhat dated effects may seem quaint compared to some contemporary horror, but there’s no denying the power the film continues to have over those who see it for the first time.2.&nbsp;Hereditary (2018)(Photo by ©A24)Writer-director Ari Aster made a huge splash with his feature directorial debut, a dark family drama about the nature of grief couched within a supernatural horror film. Toni Collette earned a spot in the pantheon of great Oscar snubs with her slowly-ratcheted-up-to-11 performance as bedeviled mother Annie, but the movie’s biggest shock came courtesy of… Well, we won’t spoil that here. Suffice it to say&nbsp;Hereditary struck such a nerve with moviegoers that it instantly turned Aster into a director to watch and shot up to second place on our list.3.&nbsp;The Conjuring (2013)(Photo by Michael Tackett/©Warner Bros. Pictures)James Wan has staked out a place among the modern&nbsp;masters of horror, directing films like&nbsp;Saw,&nbsp;Dead Silence,&nbsp;Insidious, and this inspired-by-true-events chiller based on the experiences of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The Warrens, best known for their work on the strange case that inspired the&nbsp;Amityville Horror movies (which played a part in The Conjuring 2), were portrayed by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, who grounded the effective jump scares and freak-out moments with a believable world-weariness. Together, Wan and his co-leads found fresh terror in familiar genre tropes, and the end result is a sprawling cinematic universe that only continues to grow.4.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Shining&nbsp;(1980)(Photo by ©Warner Brothers)Literally dozens of Stephen King’s novels and stories have been adapted for the big screen, and several of those films are considered classics today, like&nbsp;Carrie,&nbsp;Misery, and&nbsp;Pet Sematary (and that doesn’t even account for non-horror stuff like&nbsp;The Shawshank Redemption and&nbsp;Stand By Me). But the mother of them all is easily Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation of&nbsp;The Shining. A marvel of set and production design and a genuinely unnerving take on the traditional haunted house story,&nbsp;The Shining features a host of memorable images and an iconic Jack Nicholson performance. The film’s relatively few jumps scares are still absolutely chilling, but its true power lies in the way it crawls under your skin and makes you experience Jack Torrance’s slow descent into madness. It’s rightfully considered one of the greatest horror films ever made, and it ranked fourth in our poll.5.&nbsp;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)(Photo by Everett Collection)While the top four movies on this list collectively garnered 42% of the total votes counted, they were followed by six films that all earned around 3% of the vote each. In other words, these last six films were separated by no more than 60 votes. The first of them is&nbsp;this low-budget slasher directed and co-written by Tobe Hooper, very loosely inspired by the crimes of Ed Gein.&nbsp;Texas Chainsaw’s grimy aesthetic helped lend it an air of authenticity, which made it all the more frightening (“This could&nbsp;actually happen, you guys!”), and the massive, menacing presence of Gunnar Hansen’s Leatherface paved the way for other brutes like Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees. Multiple attempts have been made to breathe new life into the franchise — and we have another one on the way — but none have equaled the original in sheer, over-the-top, power tool-inspired terror.6.&nbsp;The Ring (2002)(Photo by ©DreamWorks courtesy Everett Collection)It’s always a tricky proposition to take something that works well for one culture and try to translate that formula successfully for another, but Gore Verbinski managed that with&nbsp;The Ring. A remake of Japanese director Hideo Nakata’s acclaimed thriller about a cursed videotape,&nbsp;Verbinski’s take kept the original film’s striking visual imagery — the&nbsp; ghost of a young girl in a white dress with long black hair covering her face — and found that it scared the hell out of audiences no matter where they were from. While the film wasn’t as well-regarded as its predecessor, it features a committed performance from a then up-and-coming Naomi Watts, and for many, it served as an introduction to East Asian horror cinema.7.&nbsp;Halloween (1978)(Photo by ©Compass International Pictures)Coming in at the seventh spot on our list is the film that introduced the world to all-time scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and put John Carpenter on the map.&nbsp;Halloween is frequently cited as one of the earliest examples of the slasher genre as we know it today, and while it may not feature the same kind of realistic gore we’ve come to expect of films in that category, it packs a lot of tension and some inventive thrills in a relatively small-scale package. The film’s legacy is also fairly untouchable: Michael Myers’ mask has become the stuff of legend, and the giant, unstoppable killer and the “final girl” have become ingrained in the horror lexicon. There’s a reason the franchise is still going after more than 40 years.8.&nbsp;Sinister (2012)(Photo by ©Summit Entertainment)For those who didn’t read the “scientific study” mentioned at the top, we’ve finally come to the film it crowned the scariest. Before he joined the MCU with 2016’s&nbsp;Doctor Strange, director Scott Derrickson had racked up a few horror films, a couple of which earned cult followings. One of them was this small-scale haunted house/possession story about a true-crime writer (Ethan Hawke) who moves his wife and kids into a house where a family was murdered, only to discover the new place might already have a rather evil tenant. Writer C. Robert Cargill was reportedly inspired to pen the script based on a nightmare he had after watching&nbsp;The Ring, and the story does share a minor similarity with that film, what with the creepy snuff film angle. But for many who saw it, the dramatic reveals and creepy set pieces far outweighed any recycled genre tropes that might have been present. Plus, there’s at least one report out there that says it’s the scariest movie ever made, so that must count for something.9.&nbsp;Insidious (2010)(Photo by ©FilmDistrict courtesy Everett Collection)James Wan has already shown up higher on the list, but before he and Patrick Wilson made&nbsp;The Conjuring, they worked together on this supernatural thriller about a young boy who falls into a coma and begins to channel a malevolent spirit. The bare bones of the story weren’t the most groundbreaking, but frequent Wan collaborator Leigh Whannell infused it with a compelling enough mythology that it spawned three more installments. Wan also stated that&nbsp;Insidious was meant to be something of a corrective to the outright violence of&nbsp;Saw, which compelled him to craft something on a more spiritual level, and the end result is an effective chiller featuring what is frequently regarded one of the best jump scares ever put on screen.10.&nbsp;IT (2017)(Photo by Brooke Palmer/©Warner Bros.)The fear of clowns is a very real thing, even if it’s become so commonplace to announce it that it feels disingenuous. If you needed any further evidence, we direct you to the box office haul of 2017’s&nbsp;IT, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, which went on to beat&nbsp;The Exorcist’s 44-year record as the highest-grossing horror film ever. Oh, and of course, its 10th-place finish on this list.&nbsp;Andy Muschietti’s big-budget adaptation drew on nostalgia to tell its story of children scarred by trauma, while Bill Skarsgard’s take on Pennywise the evil, shapeshifting clown was bizarre and unsettling in all the right ways. Add a healthy dose of jump scares, a handful of impressive set pieces, and some top-notch CGI, and you’ve got a recipe for a horror film that’s both fun and full of scares.Thumbnail image&nbsp;by&nbsp;©FilmDistrict courtesy Everett CollectionOn an Apple device?

But that’s why god invented the sidekick. They are the color to the protagonist’s black-and-white, the fiery, funny fools who often drive the story’s complications, as the protagonist runs around putting out all the fires.Because a fair number of horror films feature female leads, many of these sidekicks are also female characters. Sometimes they bolster the protagonist’s confidence, sometimes tear it down. Occasionally they take on traits of a villain, only to be revealed as the true center of the film. Often they perish, and their deaths trigger an extra significance: If this person with quick wit and endearing flaws can die, then things are about to get serious.One of the greatest – to our mind – is Barb, played by Margot Kidder, in&nbsp;the original&nbsp;Black Christmas. As we prepare for the&nbsp;release of Blumhouse’s&nbsp;Black Christmas&nbsp;remake&nbsp;this week, here are 15 of the most colorful sidekicks of horror cinema.Barb&nbsp;in&nbsp;Black Christmas (1974)  71%(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection )Played by Margot KidderVery few horror films possess the kind of joy Bob Clark’s Black Christmas emits when resident alcoholic and prankster Barb (Margot Kidder) patiently explains to a befuddled cop that her phone number begins with the word “fellatio.” Nor do they revel in a character’s tangential knowledge as much as when Barb interjects with some serious turtle-sex facts while a father is grieving his missing daughter. Barb may not be the final girl, but she fills our stockings with delightful coal.Tatum&nbsp;in&nbsp;Scream (1996)  79%(Photo by © Dimension Films )Played by Rose McGowanWes Craven consistently delivered some of the best female sidekicks, but Tatum (Rose McGowan) earns a spot for her 1990s “girl power” feminism that had her trying to convince her boyfriend, Casey (Matthew Lillard), that the new Woodsboro slasher could be a woman, because girls can do anything boys can do. Her kid-sister vibe – she’s literally Dewy’s kid sister – makes her a sparkling verbal sparrer, and she’s talking s–t right up until the very garage-door end.Annie and Lynda in Halloween (1978)  96%(Photo by © Compass International Pictures/ Courtesy: Everett Collection)Played by Nancy Kyes and&nbsp;P.J. Soles&nbsp;Before slashers were a thing, John Carpenter and producer Debra Hill’s prototype for the genre showcased the possibilities for fully fleshed-out sidekicks with sporty Lynda and sarcastic Annie, the bad and badder devils on Laurie Strode’s shoulders. They poke fun at the latter’s virginal purity with the kind of ribbing realistic for angsty teen girls. Both act as comic relief, proving there can and should be more than one funnywoman in the group.Pam in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)  89%(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection )Played by Teri McMinnTobe Hooper specifically asked for actress Teri McMinn’s costume to be backless and short to show off most of her “meat,” giving her a visually vulnerable feel in this slaughterhouse classic. Pam is a small role, but McMinn fills her out with a genuine openness and curiosity, a young woman of the perilous 1970s whose kind and trusting nature leads her to disaster.Juno Kaplan in&nbsp;The Descent (2006)  86%(Photo by © Lionsgate)Played by Natalie MendozaJuno is both the sidekick and the foil of Neil Marshall’s spelunking disaster. It’s her fiery, fierce, and selfish nature that draws her estranged best friend Sarah into the unexplored caves, but also the spirit that gives Sarah the will to leave her as bait and escape. Natalie Mendoza’s empathetic performance speaks to what one is capable of when scared, but not so much that her fate doesn’t seem a little fitting.Lambert in&nbsp;Alien (1979)  98%(Photo by © 20th Century Fox / courtesy Everett Collection)Played by Veronica CartwrightJoan Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) was the navigator of the USCSS Nostromo, and she spent just as much time trying to guide the crew of the ship in the right direction. She was the first to say exploring that distress call was a bad idea and the first to say they should “get the hell out of here.” Her hysterics are a natural and appropriate reaction to an alien attack and an extension of the audience’s reactions, so Lambert becomes the lens through which we view the film.Jeryline&nbsp;in&nbsp;Tales from the Crypt Presents: Demon Knight (1995)  38%(Photo by MCA/Universal Pictures/ Courtesy: Everett Collection.)Played by&nbsp;Jada Pinkett-SmithJeryline (Jada Pinkett-Smith) may be a criminal on work release at a rural hotel, but she’s got more smarts and morals than many.&nbsp;Demon Knight&nbsp;is the rare horror movie willing to off its protagonist, and Jeryline steps up from sidekick to lead, showing off her cunning by using the demon’s Don Juan charm against him and ultimately saving the night.Tina Gray in&nbsp;A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)  94%(Photo by © New Line Cinema)Played by&nbsp;Amanda WyssIf you’d only watched the first act of Wes Craven’s A Nightmare on Elm Street, you’d think Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss) were the protagonist of the film, but she’s in actuality the sidekick and catalyst for the film series. She exudes both vulnerability and strength, which is why her iconic demise and subsequent use as a puppet for Freddy Krueger’s mind tricks is a huge punch to the gut.Helen Shivers in&nbsp;I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)  43%(Photo by © Columbia/courtesy Everett Collection)Played by Sarah Michelle GellarThe key to Helen Shivers’ success as a sidekick is her unabashed and shameless vanity. Sarah Michelle Gellar’s portrayal of the character paints her as the beauty queen with depth, the most likely to succeed. She’s the woman with the plan to track down the killer and the guts to charge into the crowd of the Croaker Queen Pageant talent competition to save her friend. Unfortunately, luck just wasn’t on her side.Paige in&nbsp;House of Wax (2005)  26%(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Played by Paris HiltonWhen it was announced that Paris Hilton would play a supporting character in Jaume Collet-Serra’s remake of House of Wax, there was a resounding cheer that audiences would get to see this real-life heel bloodily sacrificed for the movie gods. The thing is: Hilton killed it. She infused Paige with the same detached and fascinating poppy materialism she possessed in her reality show, becoming the best love-to-hate-’em sidekick.Vasquez in Aliens (1986)  97%Played by Jenette GoldsteinThe descriptor “badass” is tossed around for really any female character who demonstrates anything remotely “strong.” But Jenette Goldstein’s Vasquez is potentially the only character worthy of being called a badass. Her barbed quips and buff biceps are perhaps the most memorable aspect of an extremely memorable film. She exudes fearlessness and feels nearly immortal… until she doesn’t.Yara in&nbsp;It Follows (2015)  95%(Photo by © RADiUS-TWC/courtesy Everett Collection)Played by Olivia LuccardiOlivia Luccardi’s Yara is more than a sidekick, she’s the one-woman Greek chorus of It Follows. At first, she seems like a typical tech-obsessed, disinterested teen, constantly reading things on her fictional clamshell e-reader, occasionally glancing up to sneer at her friends’ poor choices. But nearly everything Yara reads aloud to her friends contains a philosophical key to their situation, advice, and omens.Alexia in Raw (2017)  92%(Photo by © Focus World /courtesy Everett Collection)Played by Ella RumpfThe genius of Ella Rumpf’s Alexia in Julia Ducournau’s Raw is that Alexia at first seems the antagonist of the film, the source of all of her sister’s problematic cravings, but it turns out she’s really the sidekick. She’s a cutting bully who can turn on a dime to become the doting and generous big sister. Even as she emotionally tortures Justine, Alexia clearly wants to snap her sister out of her goody two-shoes demeanor and have some fun.Lily in&nbsp;Black Swan (2010)  85%(Photo by © Fox Searchlight Pictures)Played by Mila KunisJust like Alexia in Raw, Lily’s the false antagonist, the projection of all the protagonist’s fears and anxieties. In reality, she’s a smart, grounded ballet dancer, probably the sanest of the bunch, whose only hope is to nab the lead role and maybe coax Nina out of her cocooned and infantile life. In a story of paranoia and delusion, Lily’s the realest of the real.Nam-joo&nbsp;in&nbsp;The Host (2007)  93%(Photo by ©Magnolia Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)Played by&nbsp;Bae Doo-naThere are few things more admirable about director Bong Joon-ho than his ability to create characters who are both wildly inept and also extremely vain and self-satisfied with their limited abilities. Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na) as the protagonist’s gold medalist archer sister who rubs her mediocre success in his face is one of Bong’s greatest creations. It’s impossible for her to swallow her pride, even as she’s face-to-face with a monstrous adversary.Black Christmas&nbsp;is in theaters December 13, 2019Like this?

See the trailers and find out when they're being releasedby Matt Cabral | June 14, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by CD Projekt Red)Every year in late spring, gamers and press from around the globe converge on the Los Angeles Convention Center to get a sneak peek of the latest and greatest video games being revealed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo.For E3 2019 this week, heavy hitters Microsoft, Nintendo, and Ubisoft broke out the big guns for their latest projects, but a number of movie- and TV-based games have emerged as some of the week’s most promising prospects. Game developers no doubt hope to score the same sort of critical acclaim as last year’s Marvel’s Spider-Man.Here are 10 of those pop culture–centric projects — and&nbsp;two honorable mentions — that already have our thumbs twitching in anticipation!STRANGER THINGS 3: THE VIDEO GAMEDeveloper: BonusXPPublisher: En Masse EntertainmentPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCRelease Date: July 4Following their ravenous consumption of new Stranger Things episodes this summer, fans can dive deeper into the sci-fi horror series’ third season in a new game releasing day and date with the show. Featuring a charmingly retro visual style, complete with a pixel-perfect Sheriff Hopper, as well as solo and co-op play, Stranger Things 3: The Video Game invites fans to solve puzzles, battle supernatural baddies, and uncover Hawkins’ — and the Upside Down’s — darkest secrets.MARVEL ULTIMATE ALLIANCE 3: THE BLACK ORDERDeveloper: Koei Tecmo Games, Team NINJAPublisher: NintendoPlatforms: Nintendo SwitchRelease Date: July 19Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order easily earns its title, as it allows players to assemble teams of iconic characters from all corners of the Marvel Universe. Playing solo — or as part of a four-player super-team — fans can choose from nearly 40 characters, from the Avengers and Fantastic Four to the X-Men and Guardians of the Galaxy. Dynamic action-RPG gameplay, a gorgeous visual presentation, and an original Thanos-thwarting tale round out this fan-pleasing package.BLAIR WITCHDeveloper: Bloober TeamPublisher: Lionsgate GamesPlatforms: Xbox One, PCRelease Date: August 30The future of the&nbsp;Blair Witch&nbsp;franchise might be in limbo, but the cult-favorite&nbsp;film series’&nbsp;faithful followers can return to the Black Hills Forest this summer. A story-driven, psychological horror entry from the team behind the nerve-fraying Layers of Fear games, Blair Witch weaves a fresh, frightening tale, complete with shaky camcorder footage, atmospheric environments, and the sort of imagery that will take up permanent residence in your nightmares.STAR WARS JEDI: FALLEN ORDERDeveloper: Respawn EntertainmentPublisher: Electronic ArtsPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: November 15Gaming’s latest take on the galaxy far, far away puts players in the role of Cal Kestis, a Padawan on the run from the Empire’s Jedi-hunting Inquisitors. Set shortly after the events of Episode III, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a single-player, story-driven action-adventure featuring familiar faces from both the light and dark sides, dynamic lightsaber combat, Stormtrooper-crushing Force powers, and an adorable companion droid that could top BB-8 on the cuteness scale.JUMANJI: THE VIDEO GAMEDeveloper: FunsolvePublisher: Outright GamesPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCRelease Date: November 15Landing ahead of the holiday season’s highly-anticipated Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle sequel comes a new game based on the family-friendly franchise. Embracing the action, humor, and exotic environments of the films, the game features four-player co-op (both online and local) and a delightfully stylized take on the films’ colorful cast of characters.THE WALKING DEAD ONSLAUGHTDeveloper: SurviosPublisher: SurviosPlatforms: Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, PlayStation VRRelease Date: Fall 2019Given virtual reality’s immersion-ratcheting nature, it’s not surprising so many game developers have leveraged the tech to scare the pants off players. The Walking Dead Onslaught aims to up the ante in this regard, putting brave fans face-to-rotting-face with the franchise’s brain-craving foes. Sporting visceral combat — supported by a “progressive dismemberment system” — and a new story, the game also puts players in the boots of their favorite survivors from the AMC series.THE DARK CRYSTAL: AGE OF RESISTANCE TACTICSDeveloper: BonusXPPublisher: En Masse EntertainmentPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCRelease Date: 2019The Dark Crystal renaissance continues with a new game based on the cult-favorite film’s 10-episode prequel series set to hit Netflix this summer, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. Dubbed Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics, the title combines strategy-focused combat with deep role-playing game elements, all brought to life by a charming visual presentation that should please fans of the original Jim Henson– and Frank Oz–directed film.CYBERPUNK 2077Developer: CD Projekt RedPublisher:&nbsp;CD ProjektPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date:&nbsp;April 16, 2020Cyberpunk 2077 doesn’t find its genesis in film and TV, but the title scores whoa! points for hiring thespian&nbsp; Keanu Reeves to anchor the game. Reeves plays rocker Johnny Silverhand, a high-profile NPC who personifies the malware infecting the biochip in the player’s character. The Matrix&nbsp;trilogy star, just off Certified Fresh hit&nbsp;John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum, is soon to appear in 2020&nbsp;film&nbsp;Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music. Plus, CD Projekt Red is the company behind the hugely popular Witcher&nbsp;video game series,&nbsp;which is being turned into a Netflix&nbsp;show starring Henry Cavill (Justice League).Read Also: “Upcoming Video Game Movies and TV Adaptations”MARVEL’S AVENGERSDeveloper: Crystal Dynamics, Eidos MontrealPublisher: Square EnixPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: May 15, 2020Avengers Endgame has come and gone, but Marvel fans will get to reassemble Earth’s Mightiest Heroes in this ambitious action-adventure from the folks behind the rebooted Tomb Raider franchise. Whether saving the day solo or teaming up online with a co-op crew of four, players will unleash the skills and powers of Captain America, Black Widow, Iron Man, and the Hulk in a brand new, cinematic story that further expands on Marvel’s rich universe.LEGO STAR WARS: THE SKYWALKER SAGADeveloper: TT GamesPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCRelease Date: 2020The enormously popular and prolific LEGO video game series kicked off with 2005’s LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game. That legacy now comes full-circle with the sprawling Skywalker Saga, a collection of nine brick-based games from a galaxy far, far away. On top of revisiting previously released entries based on Episodes 1-7, the Death Star–sized compilation — which will allow fans to begin the story at any point — brings The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker to block-y life for the first time.JOHN WICK HEXDeveloper: Bithell GamesPublisher: Lionsgate Games, Good Shepherd EntertainmentPlatforms: PC, (conoles TBA)Release Date: TBAIf you were expecting a game based on the blockbuster John Wick franchise to be a brainless, button-mashing shooter, you’d be wrong. Dead wrong. A brilliant blend of&nbsp;gun-fu action and strategy, John Wick Hex will have players plan every trigger-pull behind each precision shot, just as the Baba Yaga would. Toss in a stylized visual presentation and universe-expanding story and this smart shooter is right on target. Players are the titular assassin, played by Keanu Reeves in the&nbsp;film franchise (no word on his participation here).ELDEN RINGDeveloper: FromSoftwarePublisher: Bandai Namco EntertainmentPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: TBAAnother title not&nbsp;based on an existing film or TV property, this dark fantasy entry deserves a mention for George R.R. Martin’s involvement. A brand-new universe created by Game of Thrones mastermind Martin and From Software’s Hidetaka Miyazaki (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice) Elden Ring has the potential to be a pretty big deal. At the very least, it gives Martin’ fans — patiently waiting for his next book and/or suffering withdrawals from HBO’s GoT conclusion — something new to obsess over.Like this?

Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)In Wes Anderson movies, dogs usually get the short end of the whimsy stick. The rampage began in The Royal Tenenbaums, when the family beagle is crushed by a car driven by Owen Wilson on mescaline. Since then, dogs are routinely killed, poisoned, and abandoned. As if to repent, Anderson is releasing a new stop-motion adventure all about dogs…who are crushed, killed, poisoned, and abandoned. But, hey, it’s called Isle of Dogs, a pun when said aloud about how much Anderson loves man’s best friend. Sure, dude.Seriously, though, Isle of Dogs is a terrific tribute to the purity and loyal spirit of dogs, one that also can’t help take a few potshots at cats . The cats versus dogs debate has been raging since time immemorial, but today we’re going to solve it like true 21st century people: by throwing up a bunch of numbers on your screen! We’ve taken the 20 highest-rated dog movies, and the 20 highest-rated cat movies, and averaged out a Tomatometer for each list. The animal has to be the main crux of the plot, and movies where the dogs and cats share top billing are not included — so no Incredible Journeys or Milos &amp; Otiseses.20 Best Dog MoviesOld Yeller: 100%101 Dalmatians: 98%Heart of a Dog: 96%Lassie Come Home: 94%Best in Show: 94%Lassie&nbsp;(2006): 93%Snoopy, Come Home:92%White Dog: 92%Lady and the Tramp: 90%My Dog Tulip: 90%Bolt: 89%White God: 89%Lassie&nbsp;(1994): 88%Frankenweenie: 87%Benji: 86%Wendy and Lucy: 85%A Boy and His Dog: 75%My Dog Skip: 73%Eight Below: 72%White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf: 71%AVERAGE: 88%20 Best Cat MoviesKedi: 98%Born Free: 94%The Rabbi’s Cat: 94%That Darn Cat!: 93%Duma: 93%The Lion King: 92%The Cat Returns: 90%Harry and Tonto: 88%The Black Cat: 87%Puss in Boots: 84%A Cat in Paris: 82%Two Brothers: 78%Keanu: 78%A Street Cat Named Bob: 76%The Lion King 1 1/2: 76%The Cat from Outer Space: 75%Disneynature African Cats: 71%Roar: 70%The Aristocats: 67%Cat’s Eye: 67%AVERAGE: 82%The Tomatometer speaks (or barks, in this case): Dog movies get the edge over cats! But why stop there? Continue on as we break down the stats even further.RUFF SKETCHES &amp; FE-LINE DRAWINGBuena Vista Pictures/courtesy Everett CollectionAnimated dog movies: 101 Dalmatians, Snoopy, Come Home, Lady and the Tramp, My Dog Tulip, Bolt, FrankenweenieAverage Tomatometer: 91%Animated cat movies: The Rabbi’s Cat, The Lion King, The Cat Returns, Puss in Boots, A Cat in Paris, The Lion King 1 1/2, The AristocatsAverage Tomatometer: 84%With a little imagination, you can draw a line from the earliest cave drawings to Space Chimps 2: Zartog Strikes Back. Since the beginning, we’ve observed and studied animals around us, for re-creation on whatever canvas available. So it’s no surprise that cartoons, our updated cave art, are synonymous with talking animals, and that a significant portion of the top 20 cats and dog movies are animated. For our canine pals, the average Tomatometer for the seven animated movies is 91%. For our kitty compatriots, the T-meter for the six animated movies equals 84%, thanks to Walt Disney (The Lion King), Studio Ghibli (The Cat Returns), and Dreamworks (Puss in Boots). Why has Pixar not made the effort? Are they secretly running some anti-cat ring from their basement dungeon in Emeryville? Look into it, people.DOGS &amp; CATS LIVING TOGETHER, MASS HYSTERIAOscilloscope/courtesy Everett CollectionDog documentaries: Heart of a DogTomatometer: 96%Cat documentaries: Kedi, African CatsTomatometer: 88%Two documentaries pop up on the cat list: Kedi, an endearing look at strays in Instanbul, and African Cats, featuring cheetahs and lions in Kenya. From the streets to the tundra to your apartment, cats remain in our eyes independent, mysterious, and almost otherwordly. Probably why we make more documentaries about them than dogs. Dog movies revolve around their connection with humans, good fodder for tugging at the heart strings in narrative films. And the only dog documentary here, Heart of a Dog, is indeed about a dog’s bond with its master, artist Laurie Anderson. It’s 96% on the Tomatometer, while the two cat documentaries average 88%.KILL YOUR (ANIMAL) DARLINGSMovies where the dog dies: Old Yeller, White Dog, My Dog Tulip, My Dog Skip, Eight BelowAverage Tomatometer: 86%Movies where the cat dies: The Lion King, Harry &amp; Tonto, The Black CatAverage Tomatometer: 88%Some people refuse to watch movies knowing the dog is going to die. But how does canine death affect the Tomatometer? Movies where a dog is killed (on-screen or off) average 86%, two percentage points down from the top 20’s 88%. But when the cat dies, the average Tomatometer actually goes up, also to a healthy 88%. What happened to the stereotype of film critics being cat people? Or is this all some twisted projection of resentment upon their own pets? You be the judge.BITING THE HANDCriterion CollectionMovies where the dog bites someone: White God, 101 Dalmatians, White Dog, A Boy and His Dog, White Fang 2Average Tomatometer: 85%Movies where the cat scratches someone: Two Brothers, Puss in Boots, Roar, Cat’s EyeAverage Tomatometer: 75%Enough about killing your pets. What happens when feral instinct rears its furry head and cats and dogs attack people? With dogs, critics seem pretty okay with it: the average Tomatometer only drops to 85%, and frankly, some of the people deserve it, like the burglars in 101 Dalmatians. And we’re including Blood from A Boy and His Dog; he doesn’t bite anybody, but he does help himself to some human delicacies, if you catch our post-apocalyptic drift. Meanwhile, critics are no fans of cat scratch fever: the average rating drops to 75% in movies where cats go on the offense. Keep those claws in your paws, kittens.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Rom-Com, Biopics, love","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"cats-vs-dogs-which-one-has-the-better-movies"},{"id":"47612605745439","title":"On DVD This Week: Keanu, The Lobster, The Knick, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})On DVD This Week: Keanu, The Lobster, The Knick, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | August 1, 2016 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got a high-concept comedy, some really solid television, a handful of noteworthy smaller releases, and the late Garry Marshall’s final film.

In this week’s Further Reading, Kim Newman celebrates The King of Kong.This is the most exciting, audience-involving film of any kind I’ve seen this year. At none of the previews of the summer’s blockbusters was I part of such a vocal, enthusiastic and wholly-gripped crowd as I was at a relatively small screening of a picture which has made its UK debut as a DVD retail item.The King of Kong is an aptly ragged-looking documentary which takes a completely uninviting subject — a controversy in the world of retro-computer gaming about whether longtime Donkey Kong champion Billy Mitchell should cede his title to contender Steve Weibe — and makes it the stuff of legends. Donkey Kong, for those who don’t remember, is (or, rather, was) an early, fiendishly difficult game from the Super Mario Bros stable, in which the plumber tries to ascend various ladders to rescue a princess, while avoiding missiles tossed by a malign ape. From the DVD extras, I learned that the game was originally supposed to feature Popeye, Olive Oyl and Bluto, but the Japanese designers couldn’t get the rights to the characters and came up with their own.Billy Mitchell, hailed as ‘the gamer of the century’, is a reptilian, faux-cool smarm-bucket who invokes fanatical loyalty from longtime rivals and associates, including Brian Kuh (the third-highest DK scorer), who scuttles around with Renfield-like devotion to his master, and Walter Day, the bizarre Roberts Blossom lookalike who has taken on the mantle of definitive judge for the field (an accolade confirmed when he strikes an alliance with the Guinness Book of Records).Though a patriot, a family man, a successful hot sauce tycoon and rated as ultra-cool by his circle, the goateed and distinctively coiffed Mitchell comes across onscreen as a classic villain. Even his closest friends call him devious, but he is also tragically puffed up in his idea of celebrity, flirting with the interviewer and referring to himself in the third person as if he were a world leader planning a counter-coup rather than a probable saddo whose highest achievement (a perfect Pac-Man score) means less and less with every passing minute.Wiebe, by contrast, is a classic underdog: following a run of near-miss careers in baseball and music, he took up the game after being laid off, then reinvented himself as a science teacher loved by his students. Crucially, in this showing at least, he doesn’t even seem to think that much of his knack for DK, though he is clearly as obsessively devoted to chasing the record as Mitchell is to keeping it.Director Seth Gordon intended a more general inside-retro-gaming documentary but lucked into an astonishingly potent storyline and must have sorted through acres of footage to get stuff this good. So good, in fact, a dramatised remake is reportedly in the works. It has vivid supporting characters, including Roy Schild (aka ‘Mr Awesome’), a secondary ‘evil mastermind’ in Wiebe’s camp and Wiebe’s amazing children (a young son who shouts ‘stop playing Donkey Kong‘ as Dad is on his first record-breaking attempt, a tweenage daughter who wryly observes that a lot of people ruin their lives trying to get into the Guinness Book of Records).You also get as many ups and downs as a sports fiction film, with the added plus that since it’s a true story the outcome isn’t decreed by cliché — though there are triumphs and disasters near the end, the story goes on and you can’t stop yourself looking up on the internet to find out who reigns as the current King of Kong. Everyone, including the near-saintly but not sanctimonious Wiebe, reveals more about themselves than the average reality TV contestant would, with many jaw-dropping statements about epochal achievements and grand calamities that took place in a world of game-playing marginalised by the end of the 1980s.Mitchell and cohorts act in such a way that, even if it turned out Gordon manipulated and edited the hell out of the footage, it would be impossible for your conclusions about these people not to be — to some extent – horribly true. When Wiebe sends in a tape of his first record-breaking score, Day has agents talk their way into his house to assess his personal DK machine to see if it’s been tampered with, Mitchell claims only scores achieved in public count and the record doesn’t go into the books. When Wiebe does it again at a games convention, Mitchell has protégé Doris Self (an 80-year-old Q*Bert whizz) hand over a blurry, splicey tape in which he purportedly sets a higher record which Day and company accept within ten minutes.I don’t see how this incident could be spun in a way which doesn’t suggest the tiny sub-culture was stacked against the outsider, though there’s a subtle thread later in the film, which I suspect comes from a dawning awareness of what they look like on the record, as Day and his crowd (except the loyal Kuh) begin to feel the long-time champion has been less than honest with them and respond to Wiebe’s essential decency even as they consistently mispronounce his name.There’s a stunning moment when the antagonists almost meet, for the only time in the film, as Wiebe is openly friendly to Mitchell, who cruises by ignoring him at a games machine while making a snide remark to his wife; it may be that when the cameras weren’t on them, these men have played each other or treated each other courteously, but the audience I saw it with hissed a pantomime villain and cheered for the decent contender. Even Mitchell’s obviously genuine decency towards Doris, a little old lady whose gaming career he enabled and championed, doesn’t take the sting out of his Dick Dastardly act elsewhere.It makes good use of 1980s inspirational pop music, and — like the best of these ‘American weirdo’ documentaries (American Movie, Spellbound) — works up a vein of melancholy sympathy for folks who fanatically and unselfconsciously pursue goals that seem absurd. The middle-aged guy dressed like a teenager who wistfully remembers thinking that the guys who racked up big arcade scores would have hot babes clustering about them perfectly encapsulates the delusional, funny-sad heroism of the world of Kong.Good documentaries can be made about significant subjects, like the recent Iraq/torture-themed Standard Operating Procedure and Taxi to the Dark Side, but sometimes outstanding true life films spin gold out of ostensibly ridiculous, trivial material.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Best, TV, Tubi, reviews, batman, Superheroes, Comedy, natural","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"further-reading-celebrating-the-brilliance-of-the-king-of-kong"},{"id":"47612579569944","title":"National Society of Film Critics Award Winners Announced: Lady Bird Wins Best Picture","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})National Society of Film Critics Award Winners Announced: Lady Bird Wins Best Pictureby RT Staff | January 8, 2018 |  CommentsOn Saturday, January 6, the National Society of Film Critics announced the recipients of their annual awards.

Some of the smaller movies do boast the festival accolades or the requisite star power either behind or in front of the lens to rack up some awards buzz, but far more of them flutter away without much fanfare. With that in mind, we here on staff at RT have chosen our favorite films that went mostly&nbsp;unnoticed by audiences at large in 2016. Read on for the full list of our Off the Radar picks of the year.American Honey (2016)  79%At once epic and intimate, American Honey is a film that’s completely of the moment, like a series of snapshots from the forgotten corners of America. Andrea Arnold’s episodic road movie about a group of throwaway teenagers crisscrossing the country to sell overpriced magazine subscriptions door to door has a palpable sense of discovery and danger, along with an almost tactile sense of dry heat, sweaty clothes, and buzzing insects. At the heart of everything is Sasha Lane, the preternaturally gifted actress that Arnold plucked off a beach to star in her film; as Star, Lane is alternately headstrong and naïve, tough and thoughtful. Some might be put off by the film’s nearly three-hour runtime, or by its meandering plot, or perhaps by Lane’s co-star Shia LeBeouff (who’s terrific, by the way). Me, I’d love to spend even more time in the van with these kids, just to see what else lies in store somewhere down the highway. — Tim RyanAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonThe Boy And The Beast (Bakemono No Ko) (2016)  88%Even casual fans of modern anime have seen&nbsp;director Makoto Shinkai&nbsp;declared “the new Hayao Miyazaki,” as&nbsp;Shinkai’s newest release Your Name&nbsp;becomes Japan’s&nbsp;second-highest grossing film behind Miyazaki’s Spirited Away. But with Your Name not hitting American theaters until 2017, I’m recommending a film you can see&nbsp;right now: The Boy and the Beast by Mamoru Hosada, the other new Miyazaki. Like the master himself, Hosada rose through television ranks (working on Samurai Champloo and Digimon), honing his action storytelling craft into eventual features like the breathless Summer Wars. The&nbsp;Boy and the Beast itself hews close to Spirited Away, a contemporary tale of disaffected youth in Japan who discover portals into an alternate world populated by monsters and fantastic creatures. It’s a showcase for Hosada’s punchy battle sequences and family drama, without excessive sentimentality. — Alex VoAvailable on: AmazonGimme Danger (2016)  95%Gimme Danger is an appreciative look at Iggy and the Stooges, viewed through the loving lens of filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, who considers them the greatest band of all time. Even non-devotees will enjoy the Stooges’ story, as told by Iggy Pop (aka Jim Osterberg),&nbsp;his bandmates (including Scott Asheton, Ron Asheton, James Williamson and Steve Mackay), and others close to the group during its rise and fall. Gimme Danger features great footage, excellent music, entertaining interviews, and a surprising amount of humor. Iggy Pop’s memory is a wonder to behold, especially considering everything he’s been through. His detailed recollection of the band’s origin and misadventures take you on a great rock-and-roll journey of a band discovered, lost, and then found again. It’s a great reminder, lest anyone forget, of the sweeping influence that Iggy and The Stooges continue to have to this day. And for those who are lucky enough to be learning about them for the first time, Gimme Danger is a fantastic place to start. — Beki LanePreorder on: AmazonHunt for the Wilderpeople (2016)  97%New Zealand writer, director, and actor Taika Waititi has soared off the radar with releases Boy (2012), What We Do in the Shadows (2015), and this year’s Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Hilarious vampire “documentary” Shadows went straight for the comedy jugular and scored cult status almost immediately. Wilderpeople, about a 12-year-old New Zealand boy in the foster-care system, shares a quirky pathos with 1980s-set Boy. The film stars young newcomer Julian Dennison as the hip-hop loving city kid Ricky Baker, who goes to live in the country with Bella (Rima Te Wiata), a foster mom with a heart of gold, and irascible Uncle Hec (Sam Neill). When events turn and threaten to send him to a foster care institution, Ricky runs away into the bush with Uncle Hec not far behind, kicking off a national manhunt that brings the two closer together. It’ll be interesting to see how Waititi employs his talent for storytelling as director on 2017 superhero release Thor: Ragnarok. And if you haven’t yet seen Boy and What We Do in the Shadows, get to it, you egg. — Debbie DayAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonThe Lobster (2016)  87%This is one of my favorite movies of the year. &nbsp;I’m reluctant to describe much of the plot, because I think there are sublime surprises in this movie. &nbsp;Suffice to say that it may be the darkest and sharpest satire about love and relationships that I’ve ever seen. &nbsp;Colin Farrell gives us a subtly hilarious performance as a man desperate to find love, and there are excellent supporting turns from Rachel Wiesz and John C. Reilly, among others. &nbsp;As the reviews came in, we saw references to Franz Kafka and Charlie Kaufman, which should give you an idea as to what you’re in for. &nbsp;If you like your satire with a generous helping of black humor, you’re going to love this one. — Matt AtchityAvailable on: FandangoNOW, Amazon, Amazon PrimeSing Street (2016)  95%Give John Carney this much: the man knows his niche. With 2007’s Once and 2013’s Begin Again, he demonstrated a talent for telling bittersweet yet ultimately hopeful stories about bruised hearts bonded by music — and as evidenced by this year’s Sing Street, he’s still honing his craft. Set in 1980s Ireland, it uses the travails of a pop-obsessed working-class kid as the solid underpinnings for a coming-of-age drama that’s part early MTV-era jukebox musical, part Commitments-style band picture, and part swooning romance — all bound together by a talented cast and an irresistibly uplifting story that sinks its hooks in you as deep as the effortless homages on its sing-along soundtrack. — Jeff GilesAvailable on: Netflix, FandangoNOW, AmazonSwiss Army Man (2016)  72%Swiss Army Man is one of the best bromantic comedies of the year. It’s Bridget Jones’s Diary if Bridget Jones were a suicidal castaway (played here by Paul Dano), Colin Firth was a girl on a bus (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Jude, Shazza, and Tom were actually just a dead (and kind of gassy) Daniel Radcliffe. It’s a terrific, captivating story about friendship, love, mortality, and catharsis. The directing duo, Daniels, known for their music video for DJ Snake/Lil Jon’s “Turn Down for What,” have found a way to seamlessly weave in and out of humor, sadness, whimsy, and vulnerability. The film — original, musical, and absurd — will take you on a purely imaginative and surreal journey that you’ll continue to think about once the credits have rolled. Yes, it has been dubbed the “farting corpse” movie, but it is well worth your time. — Zoey MooreAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonTrain to Busan (Busanhaeng) (2016)  94%An intense, action-packed zombie story told from a unique and terrifying perspective,&nbsp;Train to Busan&nbsp;revolves around a self-centered businessman who travels with his young daughter to visit her mother, but has his plans (and life) altered by a widespread viral outbreak that infects both passengers and the world around them, forcing him to put aside his selfish behavior and work with the other passengers to survive. Even though it only had a brief theatrical life span in the US, the movie quickly became a smash hit in South Korea, where it’s now the top grossing film of the year, having earned over $80 million in the box office. It’s a “when you think things can’t get worse, be sure that they will” kind of movie that’s guaranteed to entertain and keep you on the edge of your seat. —&nbsp;Júlio de OliveiraAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonThe Wailing (Goksung) (2016)  99%He isn’t as well known in the West as Park Chan-wook (Oldboy, The Handmaiden) or Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer), but South Korean director Na Hong-jin made a name for himself with 2008’s The Chaser, and his most recent release, this year’s The Wailing, earned widespread acclaim. The story, about a rural cop investigating a string of mysterious — and possibly supernatural — murders in his small town, takes its time, but never drags, and it successfully pulls off a couple of uncommon feats. First, the beginning&nbsp;of the film is unexpectedly funny, incorporating dry wit and elements of slapstick as two bumbling police officers try to make sense of a grisly murder. But&nbsp;over time, the story&nbsp;sheds its oddball humor and shifts into pure, bloody terror, and the transition is so seamless and effective that you hardly notice it. Second, The Wailing borrows from several genre predecessors, from zombie flicks to The Exorcist, but maintains its own distinct personality, so that you never feel like the film is merely paying lip service to its inspirations. The homages feel organic, and they’re hidden under subtle enough layers that they are recognizable without being obvious. The end of the film does raise some perplexing questions, but that’s what makes it perfect for repeat viewings. It’s well-acted, beautifully shot, atmospheric, funny, a little bizarre, and ultimately chilling, and it’s well worth a watch. — Ryan FujitaniAvailable on: Netflix, FandangoNOW, AmazonWe Are Twisted F***ing Sister! (2016)  80%Most metalheads likely don’t even know the story of Twisted Sister prior to the legendary Stay Hungry album. They were the famous New York headlining heavy metal act that was destined to stay local until the end of time. But TS fought that destiny and their struggle is the highly entertaining focus of this rock doc. The ever-engaging rivalry between band founder Jay Jay French and hired-hand vocalist Dee Snider starts off the story, showing Snider’s quick ability to become the band’s leader once his talent or stamina were questioned. Who knew that telling someone the new song he wrote was “cute” could motivate him to become one of the most famous shaggy-haired metal idols of the time? And when A&amp;R reps from big recording labels are told they’ll be fired if they ever mention the name Twisted Sister again, we — knowing the outcome — can’t help but be amused with an “I told you so” level of anticipation.

Their new creature feature opens with a scene that shocks audiences in ways&nbsp;that echo the Spielberg&nbsp;film’s famous first scene, and even goes one step further, breaking one of the biggest rules of horror (and nope, we’re not saying which).The scene was not in the original screenplay, say co-writers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods; it was something Krasinski added himself in the rewrite phase. “I’ve got to give props to John for just being a crazy person,” says Beck. “I think he just really wanted, like, the opening of&nbsp;Jaws — let’s establish this monster right out the gate, and get really, really dark.” Woods adds: “You pull that on an audience and you instill this instinctual fear: These characters are fair game, so watch around every corner.”Is it one of the scariest openings, ever, though? Time will tell — we need a few years and a lot of perspective to make those kinds of calls. For now, we at Rotten Tomatoes have voted on our favorite scary opening scenes up to now, and ranked them according to just how pinned-back-in-our seats we were the first time we saw them.20. My Bloody Valentine (1981)  58%(Photo by © Paramount)This is Quentin Tarantino’s favorite slasher flick and it’s not hard to see why: It’s gruesome as hell. It’s set in a mining town, and the slasher wears a mining get-up and uses mining tools, which means a lot of inventive swinging pickaxes and nail-gun use (so much so that the MPAA had the filmmakers slice out 9 minutes of gore from the original cut). The opening is basic, over in barely two minutes, and may have suffered a touch because of those cuts. But&nbsp;its simplicity and directness is kind of&nbsp;the point: This film isn’t wasting any time, and it didn’t come to play.19. Scream 2 (1997)  81%How did director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson choose to up the ante on awesome openings in this sequel, which is actually slightly higher on the Tomatometer than the original? They showed us that original opening again, this time as a movie-within-the-movie (Stab!), starring Heather Graham as Casey Becker, who had been played in the original by Drew Barrymore. Confused? So is Jada Pinkett Smith’s Maureen, the actual victim of this super-meta opening. She just came out to see a dumb scary movie, and has no idea why her boyfriend&nbsp;has just stabbed her and the audience is doing absolutely nothing about it. Seriously, worst movie theater audience ever.18. Final Destination (2000)  35%(Photo by (c) New Line)Movie rule #96: When a flight steward says it’s going to be fine, you can bet that it really, really isn’t. This opening set the standard for the rest of the Final Destination franchise, and was believed at the time to be inspired by the explosion of TWA Flight 800 in 1996. Like the flight shown in the movie, that real-life 747 was on its way to Paris and carrying high school kids when it blew up shortly after takeoff.17. Final Destination 3 (2006)  44%(Photo by (c) New Line)It’s hard to pick the best of the Final Destination openings — replace plane with car with roller coaster and so on and they’re essentially the same — but the Rotten Tomatoes staff votes have the third installment, starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead, nudging out the others. This time we’re at an amusement park, and the latest set of unlucky teenagers is killed (or not) on a roller coaster. It’s brilliantly staged, zeroing in on virtually every “could it happen?” thought that runs through your mind when&nbsp;strapping into a fast-moving ride:&nbsp;Will the wheels come loose? What if my seat lock comes undone? The film’s Devil’s Flight roller coaster was actually a ride called the Corkscrew in Playland in Vancouver, which was made to look higher — and much deadlier — in post-production.16. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)  89%Nothing really happens in the opening few minutes of Tobe Hooper’s infamous low-budget 1974 horror flick, and yet rarely has a movie evoked so much dread so quickly. There’s that (rather long) text scroll, laying out the movie’s “maybe-based-on-a-true-story” credentials, and then those camera flashes, shocking us to life with grisly images of decomposing eyes and&nbsp;other bits and bobs. Finally, Hooper pans out to reveal a ghastly, barely-human sculpture sat upon a grave marker. Fun fact: The Narrator is none other than John Larroquette, who has said he was paid for his efforts with a marijuana joint.15. 28 Weeks Later... (2007)  71%While 28 Days Later opens in an empty London, its sequel begins in a packed house somewhere in the countryside. We’re quickly introduced to the occupants, a sweet-seeming family and a Walking Dead-style crew of likable survivors. And then all hell breaks loose. It’s not just that director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo throws everything at the scene —&nbsp;“name” actors bite it, Scream-style, and kids are in no way off limits —&nbsp;that makes it such a gut punch. It’s the way the filmmakers upend expectations, particularly when it comes to our “hero”, played by Robert Carlyle. With each choice he makes, he reveals himself to be anything but a Rick Grimes. And frankly, when the dust settles, we’re leaning #TeamZombie.14. Jeepers Creepers (2001)  46%Did you know Victor Salva’s monster flick is based on a true story? Well, the opening scene, in which the Creeper gets into his truck to tail two kids who catch him dumping a victim, was inspired by one. In 1990, Ray and Marie Thornton were driving on a Michigan road when they spotted Dennis DePue dumping what looked like a body behind an abandoned schoolhouse (it turned out to be his wife). In their court testimony, the Thorntons said that DePue proceeded to follow them in his van for miles.13. Black Christmas (1974)  71%(Photo by (c)Warner Bros.)Scream and When A Stranger Calls may have horror-dom’s most famous problem callers, but Black Christmas’s pervy “moaner” is a close runner-up. The film’s opening sequence meanders a little, lurching from one cliché (stalker cam!) to another (hiding in the closet!), with detours into calls with mom and a bit of bathroom boozing. But when the sorority sisters circle around the phone to listen to the stalker —&nbsp;who goes from static-y groans to screechy vulgarities that we won’t repeat here — it’s as transfixing as it is disturbing.12. The Stepfather (1987)  88%(Photo by ©New Century Vista Film)Sometimes seeing the aftermath of a horrible act can be even more terrifying than witnessing the act itself. The opening sequence of The Stepfather is a case in point. With each shot we’re given an awful little breadcrumb clue to what has just happened in this bland-looking suburban home. There’s the blood on Terry O’Quinn’s face. An out-of-place toy boat. A dial tone. And then… We won’t give it away. Director Joseph Ruben would go on to make more chillers in this vein — including Sleeping with the Enemy&nbsp;and The Good Son — but none would come close to creating moments as chilling as The Stepfather’s (very) cold open.11. Piranha (1978)  69%(Photo by ©New Century Vista Film)A couple decides to go skinny dipping at night and it ends badly thanks to something bite-y in the water. Sound familiar? There is a lot that sounds and looks familiar about this Roger Corman-produced answer to Spielberg’s Jaws. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t fun in its own right —&nbsp;and memorable. A bunch of the Rotten Tomatoes staff saw this one when they were kids, and the opening scene left a mark.10. Ghost Ship (2002)  16%(Photo by (c) Warner Bros.)What’s worse than an iceberg —&nbsp;right ahead? A wire, right onboard. In the best part of this pretty mediocre movie, almost an entire ship’s worth of passengers is wiped out in one fell swoop when a wire snaps and slices across a dance floor packed with revelers. It takes the well-dressed folk a few seconds to realize they’ve all been cut in halves and quarters and thirds (depending on height), and when they do, the makeup department goes to work. Side note: The little girl who survives (she was just short enough to escape) is Emily Browning.9. The Witch (2016)  90%Robert Eggers’ unnerving opening plays on every parent’s —&nbsp;or babysitter’s —&nbsp;greatest fear: A child that vanishes the second you look away. Here, a game of peak-a-boo takes a dark turn when Thomasin’s (Anya Taylor-Joy) baby brother disappears and is then seen in the clutches of a witch. Said witch is then doing something to the baby that we can’t quite make out until… wait, is that a knife?8. 28 Days Later (2003)  87%How exactly did Danny Boyle&nbsp;film in a completely empty —&nbsp;and completely eerie —&nbsp;central London? He had some help from his then teenage daughter, it turns out. Boyle has explained that in lieu of traffic marshals and police, which he couldn’t afford, his daughter and her friends tried to hold back traffic during the seven early mornings over which they shot the sequence.7. Carrie (1976)  93%High school is terrifying, and rarely has it been as terrifying as in the opening sequence of Brian De Palma’s Carrie. The film is no conventional horror flick, and the scene is no conventional horror opening, but its mark is indelible: Just try to wipe the image of a screaming Sissy Spacek begging for help from your memory.6. Dawn of the Dead (2004)  76%Online snarks have said that Dawn of the Dead’s opening seven minutes were the peak of director Zack Snyder’s career. Frankly, they’d be the peak of most directors’ careers as far as we’re concerned. In the absolutely brutal sequence, Sarah Polley’s Ana wakes to discover her neighbor’s daughter is a ravenous zombie (the fast-moving 28 Days Later kind) who isn’t making any sort of distinctions between family and food. Eyes out for the “Here’s Johnny!” nod and ears out for the excellent use of Johnny Cash’s “When the Man Comes Around” over the killer credit sequence. [Editor’s note:&nbsp;This story originally said that Ana woke to find her own daughter was a zombie — we have corrected, and regret, the error.]5. It Follows (2015)  95%It Follows opens with an almost two-minute tracking shot that coldly&nbsp;observes&nbsp;a young girl running for her life on an idyllic suburban street. We eventually join her as she gets in her car and later find her next alone on a beach. Cut to… well, just watch it. There are no big scares or jumps or monsters in these few minutes. The key horror here is mystery: Why is she running? What is she running from? And what the hell did that to her?4. Halloween (1978)  96%(Photo by © Compass International Pictures)John Carpenter told Rotten Tomatoes recently that you have two options for opening a horror film: “You can slow things down, lull people into a false sense of security, and then smack them in the face with it,” or “kick it into gear straight away —&nbsp;let’s go!” For 1978’s Halloween, he went with the latter approach, opening with a stalker-cam single shot that took him and his crew some eight hours to execute.&nbsp;Carpenter says he was inspired by long tracking shots in films like Orson Welles’ Touch of Evil.3. It (2017)  86%Director Tommy Lee Wallace’s 1990 miniseries adaptation of Stephen King’s It doesn’t open with Georgie and Pennywise’s drain-side chat —&nbsp;it begins instead with the disappearance of a little girl and a memorably abandoned tricycle —&nbsp;but it does get to the scene eventually. When the moment does come, Wallace plays it TV safe: We see Tim Curry’s clown bearing his teeth and advancing on his victim before we cut to the next scene. Andy Muschietti takes the road less traveled in his treatment of the scene, which opens 2017’s It, showing Pennywise’s attack on poor Georgie in all of its gory glory. Yes, that’s a child getting his arm chomped off —&nbsp;and Muschietti isn’t letting us look away.2. Scream (1996)  79%Wes Craven’s big comeback film kicked off a slasher revival and gave the horror genre one of its most famous lines (“What’s your favorite scary movie?”). Most of that was thanks to the opening scene, penned by horror fanatic Kevin Williamson, which plays out like a mashup of Jeopardy and the last half hour of Halloween. It was always going to be a nerve-shattering ten minutes; what made it more than that was the casting of Ghostface’s first big target, Casey Becker. Craven said he wanted to have the film’s biggest star die straight out the gate, and had considered offering the role to Alicia Silverstone. But when Drew Barrymore, who was set to&nbsp;take the lead role, said she wanted to do the opening scene, the plan changed and Craven had his “No they didn’t!” moment.1. Jaws (1975)  98%It took a lot of innovating to pull what is arguably cinema’s most famous opening together: Actress and stuntwoman Susan Blacklinie had hooks attached to her Levi’s so that drivers could pull her to and fro to get that jerked-by-a-Great-White effect; Spielberg employed a devastatingly effective predator’s-eye view to put us inside the hungry mind of the shark; and John Williams’ score did the rest of the work. The scene was a direct lift from the opening pages of Peter Benchley’s bestselling book. In those pages, the reader —&nbsp;like Spielberg’s camera —&nbsp;mostly inhabits the perspective of the beast (the opening line reads, “The great fish moves silently through the night.”). On page,&nbsp;the opening scene is as brutal and mysterious an attack as on screen. “At first, the woman thought she had snagged her leg on a rock or a piece of floating wood,” writes Benchley. “There was no initial pain, only one violent tug on her right leg. She reached down to touch her foot, treading water with her left leg to keep her head up, feeling in the blackness with her left hand.” Then comes the kicker: “She could not find her foot.”Which scary opening scene is your favorite?

Below are their selections and why they mean so much to them, beginning with a reflection from TV writer, journalist, and author Maria Lewis.“We are the original storytellers,” Taika Waititi said as he closed out his Oscars acceptance speech when he won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in 2020 for Jojo Rabbit. Waititi famously – and by his own admission – talks a lot of s–t. Yet of all the s–t he has talked over the past two decades of his career, this was the most important. Why? Because on arguably Hollywood’s night of nights, up there on a global platform, a man of mixed Māori and Jewish heritage reminded everyone that, for “Pacific Islanders” specifically, telling stories is not just something we do, it’s an integral part of who we are, what we are, and where we come from.It’s currently AAPI – Asian American Pacific Islander – Heritage Month, which is an insanely large acronym to try and group two hugely diverse and complicated ethnicities under, but hey, it’s either this or not being acknowledged you exist… The Pacific Islander term is loaded with a complicated colonial history that is probably best broken down by Kristian Fanene Schmidt in a recent Instagram video. (Kristian’s choices can be found below, too.) For those of you playing at home, essentially it’s meant to refer to every brown person living on any one of the thousands of islands that span from Palau to Easter Island.(Photo by Anita Narbey)It’s a lot of geographical space, it’s a lot of different cultures and beliefs and languages and mythologies and history, and it’s a lot of stories to cram under one “Pacific Islander” tag. Which is why the best way to celebrate the many cinematic accomplishments of such a beautiful and broad expanse of people is not to ask one person, but many, to reflect on the movies that mean the most to them – for each to talk to stories they have connected with and have celebrated, informed by their specific lived cultural experience. Which is what we have done here.As a woman of mixed descent growing up in Australasia, the films that have shaped me, defined me, lured me, are extremely personal and they are not universal, just as “Pacific Islanders” are not universal. They’re films like 2010’s Boy, now one of the lesser-known Waititi joints but a breakthrough at the time for its equal-parts hilarious and heartbreaking portrayal of absentee fathers. They’re films like 1994’s&nbsp;Once Were Warriors, a&nbsp;brutal yet important film not just for the telling of largely untold domestic&nbsp;stories and residual&nbsp;Colonial trauma, but the ripples of opportunity that the film created for talent like Temuera Morrison, a now veteran character actor and vital part of the Star Wars universe, and director Lee Tamahori, the first person of color to direct a film with a budget over $100 million in Bond movie Die Another Day.They’re films like Whale Rider, which brought the work of one of New Zealand’s great novelists, Witi Ihimaera, to the big screen and gave us a still bafflingly great performance from Keisha Castle-Hughes, who became one of the youngest Academy Award nominees for Best Actress when she was just 13 years old. She remains only the second Polynesian actress to be nominated for an acting Academy Award, following Jocelyne LaGarde in her first and only acting role in 1966’s Hawaii. They’re films like Moana, which put an amalgamation of “Pacific Islander” culture on the world stage and gave a generation of children dolls and merchandise and characters that looked like them. For all its imperfect ambition, a glossy Disney animated feature being translated into language is invaluable for the culture now and in the future.(Photo by © Magnolia Pictures)They’re films that have slipped under the radar for many, like Toa Fraser’s heart-racing The Dead Lands, from 2014, which is best described as a Māori Apocalypto and saw its own television adaptation on Shudder just last year. It’s Born To Dance, which in 2015 spotlighted the skill and significance of movement to the culture with the work of Parris Goebel, Tia Maipi, and countless others. It’s even Training Day, maybe weirdly, but for the scene-stealing performance of Cliff Curtis as Hillside Trece gang leader Smiley and what that enabled him to do for the next 20 years as a stealthy Polynesian star in Hollywood and as a producer helping shepherd the next generation of stories like The Dark Horse. It’s the work of Chelsea Winstanely, top to bottom, the first Indigenous woman ever nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award for her work on Jojo Rabbit and her tireless efforts as a storyteller to make sure that those who came before – like Merata Mita – are featured in their own stories, such as the 2018 documentary Merata: How Mum Decolonised the Screen.It’s the Jemaine Clement of it all,&nbsp;infiltrating&nbsp;Hollywood with&nbsp;Flight Of The Conchords, then crafting a very weird and specific legacy with his skills as a&nbsp;musician, as a producer, and as an entirely&nbsp;unpredictable performer who elevates everything he’s in: whether&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;Legion or&nbsp;Men In Black 3. (I said what I said). It’s the award-winning short films by women and about women, like Purea and Hinekura; it’s the rom-coms like Sione’s Wedding; it’s the documentaries like Poi E: The Story of a Song and Dawn Raid that spotlight the impact of our music.It’s endless and infinite, which is why it’s crucial to iceberg this: skim the surface and then plunge deeper based on the suggestions and cinema recommended. Because “Pacific Islander” identity is not one thing, as the career of Dwayne Johnson demonstrates. Hollywood has long struggled to understand what to do with us, but The Rock cemented (sorry) a future where one day an Indigenous kid won’t have to be grateful for the slightest crumb of representation (looking at 13-year-old me, getting pumped over Skinny Pete in The Italian Job remake). They can be a global wrestling superstar, they can be a businessman and a business, man, they can be the franchise savior, they can be the biggest star on the planet, and they can do it all while being proudly one of the “original storytellers.”—Maria Lewis is a best-selling author, screenwriter and film curator13 Pacific Islander Movies that Showcase the Richness and Diversity of Pasifika CinemaOnce Were Warriors (1994) 93%Undoubtedly one of the most important New Zealand films of all time.&nbsp;Once Were Warriors – based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Alan Duff, with a powerful screenplay from Riwia Brown – became such a cultural touchstone that it made international stars out of its central cast (trio of Rena Owen, Temuera Morrison, and Cliff Curtis) and&nbsp;catapulted Lee Tamahori into becoming one of Hollywood’s most sought-after directors. It’s a challenging film to revisit in basically every sense given its brutal portrayal of domestic violence, poverty, sexual assault, suicide, and alcoholism for an urban Māori family. That’s not to say any of these things are untrue, yet such was Once Were&nbsp;Warriors‘ impact, they almost become over-represented and stereotyped on screen in the&nbsp;decade following. An unflinching and uncompromising look at the continued impact Colonialism has on Indigenous peoples globally.—Maria LewisSione's Wedding (Samoan Wedding) (2006) 83%To me, Pacific Islanders have an innate sense of comedy – they never take themselves too seriously and are always up for a laugh. Which is why Sione’s Wedding is so special to me, because it’s the first movie I saw where the story and characters revolved around Polynesians being funny. The premise of the film is simple and of its early 2000s time period: four largely immature friends are banned from their best friend’s wedding unless they can find girlfriends. It’s the Samoan Wedding Crashers meets The Hangover. What could go wrong?–Tali AualiitiaBoy (2012) 88%It always upsets me when someone tells me they’re a Taika Waititi fan, but haven’t seen Boy: It is the best Waititi movie and it’s a hill I will die on. Set in the 1980s, Boy centers on an 11-year-old Michael Jackson fan desperately seeking the approval of his criminal father, who re-enters his life to collect a stash of money he hid before going to jail. Of course it’s funny, but there are also moments of incredible innocence and vulnerability that make this well-rounded movie both a joy and a heartbreak to watch. Come for the laughs, stay for the Māorified version of Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” dance complete with haka and poi.–Tali AualiitiaMoana (2016) 95%I&nbsp;would be remiss not to talk about Disney’s Moana. Set in Ancient Polynesia, the movie tells the story of Moana, who must enlist the help of demigod Maui to lift the curse on her island by navigating the oceans and restoring the heart of Te Fiti. Yes, it’s inclusive Disney. Yes, it’s got a powerful strong independent female lead. But for me, it’s the music. Disney enlisted music group Te Vaka’s Opetaia Foa’i to be the voice of the Pacific, and listening to Foa’i open “We Know the Way” in Samoan instantly made it feel new and exciting, but also home and familiar. Also, the movie serves as a constant reminder that my ancestors navigated the oceans using the stars while I can barely get Google Maps to work.–Tali AualiitiaIsland Soldier (2017)In being given the task to help create a “Guide to Films from the Pacific Islands,” I wanted to be very intentional in amplifying lesser known voices and issues. While Island Soldier wasn’t directed by a Pacific Islander, it is an important documentary that gives viewers a reliable insight into the exploitative and destructive nature of US militarism in the Pacific, specifically Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia. It’s becoming more and more common for this type of content to be what tips the scales in changing policy, so I encourage audiences to take the time and educate themselves by watching stories like this one and Anote’s Ark, on climate change in Kiribati, as well as Out Of State, on addiction and incarceration in Hawai’i, all of which share colonization and capitalism as the root of our problems. These are just some of our realities that don’t get the attention and certainly not the reparation they deserve.–Kristian Fanene SchmidtVai (2019) 100%Released in 2019, Vai is a beautiful collection of eight shorts spanning the Pacific, tied together by a common thread of mana wahine. What I love most about this film is that in addition to being directed by nine Pacific women, we get to see dark-skinned grandmas, mothers, daughters, and sisters in such fullness and beauty, thanks to Solomon Islands filmmaker Matasila Freshwater and Fijian filmmakers the Whippy Sisters, respectively. Due to colorism that permeates every nation, Melanesians often get erased and excluded from Pacific discourse, so I’m looking forward to seeing more content like this and the Vanuatu love story Tanna! Vai is actually a follow-up to another great movie showcasing eight Māori women directors, Waru. Be sure to watch them together, and keep an eye out for a third installment with a focus on our Aboriginal whānau coming soon.–Kristian Fanene SchmidtKumu Hina (2013)Kumu Hina&nbsp;follows the life of Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, a Native Hawaiian activist and teacher (and also the Haku Mo’olelo and narrator of this documentary). As a queer Samoan, I would be remiss not to include a narrative that speaks to the diversity in gender expression and sexuality in the Pacific that has long been demonized and outlawed because of the church and colonization. Hina is māhū, and while some māhū may identify as trans or nonbinary, I’m going to resist labeling her as such because not all do. (The trouble with using Western terms to describe Indigenous peoples is that they do not necessarily relate to them nor are they neat translations.) Navigating a world she seldom finds acceptance in, Hina is steeped firmly in her role as a cultural and spiritual leader, fighting for her people while holding true to who she is. We’re now starting to see a rise of queer Pacific content, as evidenced by another documentary made by the same creators,&nbsp;Leitis in Waiting, along with the animated short&nbsp;Kapaemahu, in which Hina serves as both a directer and producer. Hopefully there’ll be more to come.–Kristian Fanene SchmidtPatu! (1983)This year marks the 40th anniversary of the South African Springboks 1981 Rugby Tour of New Zealand – a tour met by huge anti-Apartheid protests in NZ – and it’s time to remember this watershed of mass civil disobedience. It’s also timely to remember and honor the Māori woman, single mum, self-taught filmmaker, activist and teacher, and global Indigenous film icon, Merata Mita, and how she captured on film one of the most essential documents of civil unrest in cinema history. Māori cinema exists because of her. PATU! reminds me as a Polynesian Māori woman just what Merata sacrificed and how she and a handful of creatives bravely ushered in a new age of Māori nationalism using celluloid to tell our stories. Manaaka me te Honore.–Sonja HammerNo. 2 (Naming Number Two) (2008) 58%This is Toa Fraser’s cinematic love letter to his Fijian matriarchal culture, another part of Pasifika that is rarely represented in cinema. The film is set in the largest Polynesian city on the planet, Auckland, aka Tamaki Makaurau, “The Place of Many Lovers.” Twenty years ago, every language from Te Moana-A-Kiwa (Māori for the Pacific Ocean) could be heard in its inner-city suburbs, like Ponsonby, Grey Lynn, Freemans Bay, and Toa’s own Mount Roskill – where the filmmaker grew up and the film is set – with Tongans, Samoans, Tokelauans, Niuean, Kuki Airani, and Fijian voices. These groups, once labelled as “overstayers” and FOBs ( “Fresh off the Boats” ), today are the blended cultures of post colonial Aotearoa. Toa’s on-screen neighborhood re-imagines those Islander communities I remember where beautiful elder matriarchs like Nanna Maria – the matriarch of the Fijian family in the film – sustained them with bounties of kai and plenty of aroha.–Sonja HammerThe Orator (OLe Tulafale) (2011)This legendary film made by a Samoan, spoken in Samoan, explores the Fa’a Samoa way of life. Director Tusi Tamasese’s debut is the tale of a taro farmer, Saili, a little person who exists along with his banished wife Vaaiga and daughter as outsiders, ridiculed and stalked by nearby villagers. A showdown between the chiefly hierarchy of the village and Saili comes in the form of an oratory face off. The movie’s lingering pace and profound depth of emotion – along with its authentic sense of “Island Time” – signaled that a new age had arrived in Pasifika cinema: stories about us, told through our ways of seeing.–Sonja HammerTongan Ninja (2002)Okay, disclaimer: my heritage is Tongan. So, you know, there is an obvious bias here. But any movie with “Tonga” or “Tongan” in the title? I’m there watching it and supporting it from the jump. Sure, this New Zealand-made movie may not be up there with cinematic greats like Whale Rider or Boy, but its low-budget charm and slapstick comedy does give you a hearty chuckle. Oh, and speaking of Boy, see if you can spot a super-young Taika Waititi playing a cook in the kitchen scene.–Hau LatukefuThe Legend of Baron To'a (2020) 100%Another disclaimer: the actor in the lead role, Uli Latukefu, is my little brother. Regardless, this is a gem of a movie. Also filmed in New Zealand, The Legend of Baron To’a is a story of love, loyalty, and legacy, following the story of a man who must recover his father’s championship wrestling belt after it is stolen. The humor is on point, so too the emotional beats, which is important because those dual elements are what make up your your average Pacific Islander. Laughing one minute, crying the next.–Hau LatukefuFor My Father's Kingdom (2019)A genuine heartstring-puller. If you’re like myself, a child born outside of the islands and whose father still has a strong connection and responsibility to the homeland, then you will relate to this. As a matter of fact, you don’t have to be from the islands to feel this one: the message is universal and specific at the same time. At its core, My Father’s Kingdom explores the culture clashes that generations experience when growing up between two different worlds. Misunderstanding and miscommunication can strain relationships, and the film makes you feel that sense of frustration and hurt when watching the families go through it. Yet in the end, like all family stories, there’s still a lot of love.–Hau LatukefuMeet the Contributors:Maria Lewis is an author, journalist, screenwriter, and film curator based in Australia.

Plus, we’ve got some notable smaller releases, including an Oscar-nominated animation, a well-received David Gordon Green drama starring Nic Cage, and a handful of other indie films. Read on for details:The LEGO Movie 96%The LEGO Movie could have easily turned into a 100-minute toy commercial, but in the capable hands of co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (21 Jump Street), it became a loving tribute to the power of imagination. Chris Pratt voices Emmet, an everyman LEGO figure who stumbles into the role of LEGO savior when a mystical object fuses itself to his back. With the help of an eclectic team of “builders,” Emmett attempts to foil the nefarious plans of the evil President Business (Will Ferrell). Critics were positively charmed by The LEGO Movie, rewarding it with a Certified Fresh 96% on the Tomatometer thanks to imaginative animation, a hilarious script, and a surprisingly thoughtful conclusion. The Blu-ray includes a funny and informative commentary track featuring the directors, Pratt, Will Arnett, Charlie Day, and Alison Brie; a couple of making-of featurettes; and lots of short video tidbits, including an “Everything Is Awesome” sing-along. If you opt for the “Everything Is Awesome” Edition, you’ll also get the 3D version of the film, a 3D cast of Emmet’s face, a LEGO figurine of Vitruvius, and an exclusive “Meet the LEGO Builders” featurette.The Grand Budapest Hotel 92%A story within a story within a story, The Grand Budapest Hotel recounts the tale of Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), the charismatic concierge of a luxurious mountain hotel who frequently offers his “services” to wealthy aging women. When one of them (Tilda Swinton) dies and leaves Gustave a precious painting in her will, her family becomes irate and attempts — by any means necessary — to retrieve the painting. Critics declared Grand Budapest — Certified Fresh at 92% — another triumph for Wes Anderson, replete with his trademark visual flourishes, wry wit, and a sprawling cast full of veterans like Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, and many more. The Blu-ray includes three featurettes, three short vignettes to accompany the film, and a 4-minute short following Bill Murray as he tours the various film shoot locations.Ernest &amp; Célestine 98%One of this year’s ill-fated nominees for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, Ernest &amp; Célestine is a French-Belgian animated film that takes place in a world populated by anthropomorphized bears (who live above ground) and mice (who live below). All young mice are taught that they are a choice snack for bears, but when a young orphan named Célestine is separated from her peers and encounters a hungry bear named Ernest, the two form an unlikely bond. Though the original film is voiced in French, American audiences were treated to a cast that included Paul Giamatti, Lauren Bacall, William H. Macy, and, in the lead roles, Forest Whitaker (Ernest) and Mackenzie Foy (Célestine). Critics were positively charmed by Ernest &amp; Célestine, calling its story sweet and its old-fashioned visual aesthetic delightful. The main bonus features are a 52-minute long making-of doc and a feature-length animatic (essentially a storyboard recreation of the film).House of Cards – Season TwoNetflix had itself a bona fide hit with House of Cards, whose first season ended with Kevin Spacey’s Frank Underwood accepting the post of Vice President while journalists Zoe, Lucas, and Janine (Kate Mara, Sebastian Arcelus, and Constance Zimmer) probed deeper into his shady activities. Season two finds Frank eager to remove himself even further from any possible scandal, as he deftly continues to manipulate his way up the chain of power. Critics rated this most recent season Certified Fresh at 85% on the Tomatometer, noting that the series continued to deliver the kinds of powerful performances, strong writing, and crisp cinematography typical of contemporary premium cable drama. Extras on the season boxset include a glimpse of the show’s table reads and featurettes covering the differences between the series and the original 1990s British miniseries that inspired it, Frank’s habit of breaking the fourth wall, and more.Also available this week:David Gordon Green’s Joe (83%), starring Nicolas Cage and Tye Sheridan in a Certified Fresh drama about an ex-con who befriends a teen and becomes his protector.The Machine (78%), a sci-fi thriller about two programmers who create a self-aware AI, only to have it commandeered by the government.Walk of Shame (13%), starring Elizabeth Banks and James Marsden in a comedy about a news reporter who gets stranded in the wrong part of town after a drunken one-night stand.Authors Anonymous (7%), starring Kaley Cuoco and Chris Klein in a comedy about a support group for unpublished authors whose members are rankled when one of them becomes an overnight success.And lastly, a whopping three releases from the Criterion Collection: Georges Franju’s 1963 crime thriller Judex (100%) is available for the first time in a DVD/Blu-ray combo pack, and Peter Weir’s Picnic at Hanging Rock (94%) and Peter Davis’s documentary Hearts and Minds both get new DVD/Blu-ray re-releases. Also, an additional note for all of your Criterion aficionados out there: As per a recent announcement, The Criterion Collection will resume separate DVD and Blu-ray packages, beginning with their September releases later this year.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Super, horror, comedy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-the-lego-movie-and-the-grand-budapest-hotel"},{"id":"47612875503949","title":"New on DVD & Blu-Ray: Edge of Tomorrow, Million Dollar Arm, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})New on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Edge of Tomorrow, Million Dollar Arm, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | October 6, 2014 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got a well-received sci-fi actioner starring Tom Cruise, a feelgood sports drama starring Jon Hamm, and a western spoof starring Seth MacFarlane. Then, we’ve got loads of TV and number of noteworthy indie films, as well as a Disney classic fresh from the vault. Read on for details:Live. Die. Repeat./Edge of Tomorrow 91%Based on the popular Japanese novella All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, Edge of Tomorrow (or, alternately, Live. Die. Repeat.) was one of the early surprise hits of this summer. Tom Cruise stars as William Cage, a military PR man who finds himself thrown into the heat of battle in a suicide mission. Through a chance encounter on the battlefield, Cage discovers he can relive the day over and over each time he?s killed, and uses the opportunity to team up with a veteran soldier (Emily Blunt), train, and change the outcome of the war. Though the premise could have quickly worn out its welcome, critics found the film quite clever and surprisingly funny, and thanks to solid performances from Cruise, Blunt, and a strong supporting cast, Edge of Tomorrow thrilled its way to a Certified Fresh 90 percent on the Tomatometer. The DVD/Blu-ray combo pack includes three featurettes on the armor worn in the movie, the aliens, and the pivotal battle sequence; a short doc on the making of the film; and a handful of deleted scenes. (If you’re wondering why the title is listed that way, that’s pretty much how it’s written on the packaging.)Million Dollar Arm 65%Jon Hamm is certainly a charming fellow, so it makes sense to tap his font of likability for a feelgood based-on-true-events sports drama like Million Dollar Arm. Part underdog tale, part fish-out-of-water comedy, Arm follows struggling sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Hamm) as he travels to India to recruit the country?s best cricket bowlers as prospective pitchers in the MLB. He finds two potential winners and brings them back to the US in hopes of prepping them for the big leagues. The themes at play are familiar, and Million Dollar Arm hits all the right story beats of its genre; for some critics, this made the film too predictable to enjoy, but others were willing to overlook that for Hamm’s good guy charisma and the film’s overall pleasantness. The Blu-ray includes a look at the actors’ training sequence, a profile of the real events of the story, outtakes, deleted scenes, and more.A Million Ways to Die in the West 33%Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane made his big screen directorial debut with Ted, a live action comedy that nevertheless found MacFarlane voicing the titular stuffed bear, and the result was a sizable hit. Earlier this year, MacFarlane directed himself in the flesh for the first time in the western spoof A Million Ways to Die in the West, and the result was less impressive. When a timid sheep farmer loses his girlfriend after he backs out of a duel, he befriends a beautiful newcomer (Charlize Theron) to the town who helps him discover his courage. The only problem is, said beautiful newcomer is the main squeeze of the most dastardly outlaw (Liam Neeson) around, and he don’t like nobody touchin’ his lady. Critics acknowledged the talented cast MacFarlane was able to assemble, but lamented its overlong, meandering plot and hit-or-miss juvenile gags, resulting in a disappointing 33 percent Tomatometer. Bonus features include an alternate opening and ending, alternate scenes, a gag reel, a commentary track, and a look behind the scenes.Also available this week:Disney is releasing a new Diamond Edition DVD and Blu-ray of Sleeping Beauty (92 percent), for those who may have missed it the last time it made its way out of the vault.To Be Takei (90 percent), a Certified Fresh documentary profiling the charismatic Star Trek actor, political activist, and social media icon.Obvious Child (88 percent), starring Jenny Slate in a Certified Fresh comedy about a young stand-up comic dealing with the loss of her job, a breakup, and a new pregnancy all at once.Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon (76 percent), a Certified Fresh documentary chronicling the career of the influential talent manager.Sharknado 2: The Second One (56 percent), starring Ian Ziering and Tara Reid in the follow-up to the wildly popular Syfy shlock movie about a tornado full of sharks.Season two of The History Channel’s first foray into fiction storytelling, the historical adventure series Vikings (92 percent) is available on DVD and Blu-ray.Season two of A&amp;E’s Psycho spinoff/prequel Bates Motel (86 percent) is also available on DVD and Blu-ray.Season three of Ryan Murphy’s horror anthology series American Horror Story (81 percent), subtitled “Coven” and focusing on witches, is also available on DVD and Blu-ray.Season six of The Following (47 percent) is available on DVD and Blu-ray.Psych: The Complete Series is available in a 31-disc DVD collection and comes with a ton of bonus features on every disc.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Pacific, Awards, Cinematographers, franchise, Logo, Mindy, jamie, Grammys, New, scene, Countdown, Company, Turner, awards, Unbreakable","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-edge-of-tomorrow-million-dollar-arm-and-more"},{"id":"47612921742686","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Warm Bodies and A Good Day to Die Hard","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Warm Bodies and A Good Day to Die HardPlus, a road trip comedy, an animated flop, and few worthwhile collections.by Ryan Fujitani | June 4, 2013 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got one big franchise blockbuster and a Certified Fresh comedy, plus two more big releases that didn’t fare so well with critics. On top of that, our reissues this week are fairly impressive, even if a lot of them are films you may already own. See below for this week’s ultra-short list.A Good Day to Die Hard 14%The original Die Hard is considered by more than a few to be the greatest action film ever made, and when the franchise was brought back to life in 2007 after a 12-year hiatus, many were surprised by how good it was. Unfortunately, this year’s follow-up to that film, A Good Day to Die Hard, left most wishing the series would just (ahem) die already. Bruce Willis reprises his role as supercop John McClane, who heads over to Russia after learning his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney) is in trouble with the law. Before father and son are properly reunited, however, they’re thrust into the middle of a violent political conspiracy whose agents chase them across Eastern Europe. A Good Day jumps right into the action and rarely lets up, but for the most part, critics found it tiresome and full of predictable clichés. At 15% on the Tomatometer, it’s the lowest-rated installment of the franchise, and probably won’t do much for anyone looking for a decent story to go along with their explosions.Warm Bodies 81%Over the past several years, romantic comedies have earned a reputation for uninspired cookie-cutter storytelling and vapid, one-dimensional characters, so it’s always refreshing to see a new spin on the genre. Warm Bodies, based on the novel by Isaac Marion, comedically explores the post-apocalyptic star-crossed love between a girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) and a young zombie who goes by “R” (Nicholas Hoult). R and his fellow zombies retain bits of humanity within them, and after being initially drawn to Julie, repeated interactions with her begin to bring him back from the dark side, so to speak. Directed by Jonathan Levine (50/50) and co-starring Rob Corddry, John Malkovich, and Dave Franco, Warm Bodies charmed a good number of critics, who called it surprisingly sweet and praised the cast for immersive performances. Certified Fresh at 80%, this isn’t your average rom-com, but it’s all the better for it.Identity Thief 19%Jason Bateman hasn’t had the best of luck at the multiplex recently, at least in his starring roles, and Melissa McCarthy hasn’t fared much better, which is troubling considering how likable both of them are. Putting them together in Identity Thief, unfortunately, didn’t pan out quite the way they’d hoped. Bateman plays Sandy Patterson, unwitting victim of identity fraud when a Florida woman named Diana (McCarthy) assumes “Sandy” is a woman and begins living the lavish life on Sandy’s funds. When criminal charges begin showing up on Sandy’s record, he drives down to Miami to confront Diana and bring her back to clear his name. As you might expect, both stars do their best with the material they’re given here, but they’re able to wring precious few laughs from the film’s meandering script and plot contrivances. It currently sits at 20% on the Tomatometer, which is a disappointment for all involved.Escape From Planet Earth 35%Rainmaker Entertainment’s biggest claims to fame to date are probably the popular Transformers TV series Beast Wars and the number of Barbie-themed movies they’ve produced for Mattel, but this year they tried their hand at a feature-length animated film with Escape From Planet Earth. Anchored by the voice talents of Brendan Fraser, Ricky Gervais, Jessica Alba, Rob Corddry, Sofia Vergara, and more, the film focuses on the efforts of an alien astronaut named Scorch (Fraser) from the planet Baab, who is sent to Earth (the “Dark Planet”) to trace the origins of a mysterious SOS call. When Scorch goes missing, his pal Gary (Corddry) mounts a rescue mission; cue lots of fish-out-of-water humor and Area 51-related gags. The animation and artwork is all great to look at, many critic concede, but Escape simply relies on too many elements we’ve seen before in better movies. At 26%, this might work as a colorful distraction for the kids, but don’t expect to be similarly enthralled if you’re old enough to vote, and don’t expect Rainmaker to be competing with the likes of Pixar or Dreamworks anytime soon.Also available this week:Warner Bros. has a couple of new Blu-ray sets, the first of which is a collection of the beloved Mad Max trilogy: Mad Max (1979, 95%), Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981, 100%), and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985, 81%).The second WB collection is a boxset of 20 Clint Eastwood films, ranging from his starring roles in Pale Rider (1985, 92%) and Dirty Harry (1971, 95%) to his directorial efforts like Mystic River (2003, 87%) and Letters From Iwo Jima (2006, 91%). Included in the set are also more recent films like Invictus (2009, 76%) and Trouble With the Curve (2012, 52%), as well as two feature-length documentaries: The Eastwood Factor and Eastwood Directs: The Untold Story.Likewise, Universal is also putting out a good number of reissues this week, beginning with a Blu-ray set titled Alfred Hitchcock: The Essentials Collection. The set includes five of Hitchcock’s most celebrated films — Psycho (1960, 97%), Rear Window (1954, 100%), North by Northwest (1959, 100%), Vertigo (1958, 98%), and The Birds (1963, 96%) — and a quite a hefty helping of bonus features.Universal is also offering new Blu-rays of a handful of its classic creature features, including The Invisible Man (1933, 100%), The Mummy (1932, 92%), and Creature From the Black Lagoon (1954, 83%).","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Holidays","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-warm-bodies-and-a-good-day-to-die-hard"},{"id":"47612877083982","title":"New on DVD & Blu-Ray: John Wick, Dracula Untold, Ouija, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})New on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: John Wick, Dracula Untold, Ouija, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | February 2, 2015 |  CommentsThe biggest home video release this week is a surprisingly satisfying action flick starring Keanu Reeves, but outside of that, most of the big releases received pretty poor reviews. That said, the smaller films on this week’s list are the real highlights, with three acclaimed Certified Fresh picks and another trio of highly rated films. Read on for details:John Wick 86%John Wick is about as pure a revenge flick as you’re going to get, and critics were quite pleased with that. The story is simple: Keanu Reeves plays the titular former mob hitman, who’s mourning the death of his wife when the son of a local kingpin breaks into his home, kills his new puppy, and steals his car. This is the last straw for Wick, and he unleashes a most brutal temper tantrum upon anyone foolish enough to stand between him and the puppy-killing car thief. Directed by longtime stuntmen Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, John Wick is a stylish flurry of point blank shots to the face and brooding Keanu Reeves grimaces, and for most critics, the combination was a match made in heaven. Toss in a bit of the much talked-about “world-building” and a colorful cast of side characters, and you have the makings of an action franchise. At 83 percent on the Tomatometer, John Wick surprised a lot of folks and even took home the Golden Tomato Award in the Action/Adventure category.Dracula Untold 25%Though ostensibly not part of Universal’s plan to reboot all of their classic monsters in a shared universe (kind of like The Avengers of horror), Dracula Untold doesn’t bode well for the studio’s future efforts in the genre. Untold purports to tell the “origin story” of the famous literary bloodsucker, in which Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans), the prince of Transylvania, enters into a blood pact with a vampire to receive the power necessary to turn back a Turkish invasion and save his son. Critics didn’t buy it, for the most part; while the visuals were sometimes impressive, they also tended toward bad video game imagery, and the narrative lacked both the edge and the necessary dramatic heft to justify its epic scope. At 22 percent on the Tomatometer, Dracula Untold is a poor attempt to put a fresh spin on a familiar tale.Ouija 6%As long as you’ve got a working knowledge of horror movie mechanics, a decent cinematographer, and a few million dollars to spare, you stand a chance at making a tidy profit, regardless of what the critics say. At least, that was the case for last year’s Ouija, which was produced for about $5 million and earned a mere 7 percent on the Tomatometer but went on to gross over $95 million at the box office. This PG-13 tale of terror revolves around a group of young friends who use a Ouija board to make contact with a malicious spirit; as the participants of the original séance begin dropping one by one, the remaining survivors struggle to identify the spectre and figure out a way to defeat it. Critics found the film egregiously derivative of better movies, filled with telegraphed jump scares and bland storytelling, even if it did sport a nice professional sheen. This is probably the kind of fluff that teen horror novices might eagerly devour and quickly forget, but more discerning adults will find little in the way of a real scare here.The Best of Me 12%Don’t look now, but they’ve gone and made another Nicholas Sparks adaptation, and following recent tradition, it did not perform well with critics. At all. This would-be tearjerker stars James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan as star-crossed teenage lovers Dawson and Amanda, who are reunited after 20 years apart when a mutual friend passes away. Between flashbacks to their past relationship, the pair rekindle their romance, only to discover it’s not so easy to shake off the past and move forward. By now, most folks know where they stand with Sparks’s weepy formula, and critics agree that if you’re a fan, you’re in for more of the same, and you’ll likely be pretty satisfied with the final product. If you’re anyone else, though, you probably already know you’re going to avoid this like a snotty handkerchief, so the 8 percent Tomatometer score is somewhat irrelevant.Also available this week:Nas: Time Is Illmatic (100 percent), a documentary about the prolific and influential hip-hop artist and the creation of his seminal debut album.Starred Up (99 percent), starring Jack O’Connell and Ben Mendelsohn in a Certified Fresh drama about a violent 19-year-old inmate who is transferred to the same prison as his estranged father.The Overnighters (98 percent), a Certified Fresh documentary focusing on the rush to find jobs during the North Dakota oil boom and the hardships experienced by prospective workers there.Dear White People (92 percent), a Certified Fresh satire of race politics about a mixed-race writer and radio show host at a mostly white university who causes a stir when she becomes the head of the all black house on campus.The Retrieval (34 percent), a Civil War-set drama about a 13-year-old boy working with white bounty hunters who unexpectedly finds himself on the run with a runaway slave after he’s been sent to lure him back to the South.ABCs of Death 2 (75 percent), the follow-up omnibus film featuring 26 horror segments — one for each letter of the alphabet — helmed by 26 different directors.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Elton, Animation, foreign, News","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-john-wick-dracula-untold-ouija-and-more"},{"id":"47612931252577","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: The Wolf of Wall Street, Delivery Man, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: The Wolf of Wall Street, Delivery Man, and MoreAn Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film and a handful of smaller movies complete the list.by Ryan Fujitani | March 25, 2014 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got a couple of Oscar nominees (only one of which, unfortunately, took home a trophy) and a sweet but predictable comedy starring Vince Vaughn. Then we’ve got the latest seasons of Californication and Veep, as well as a handful of smaller films, including a couple of actioners starring old school stars. Read on for the full list:The Wolf of Wall Street 79%Back in the late 1980s and 1990s, a charismatic, ambitious, and ultimately greedy young man named Jordan Belfort made gobs and gobs of money as a stockbroker before he went to jail and served 22 months for fraud. Somewhat timely in its subject matter, Martin Scorsese’s latest film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, chronicling every sleazy aspect of Belfort’s rags-to-riches story in glorious, uproarious detail. Though it courted some controversy and drew some criticism for its assorted debaucherous depictions of sex, drug use, and animal-related shenanigans, most critics found room to praise DiCaprio and Jonah Hill in particular for a couple of brazen performances, and both of them earned Oscar nods (DiCaprio for Best Actor, Hill for Best Supporting Actor) for their efforts. Wolf earned three more nominations — for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay — and though it didn’t take home any hardware on Oscar night, it’s Certified Fresh at 77%, and critics say it’s yet another winning collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio.The Great Beauty 91%The second of the Criterion Collection’s contemporary home video releases this year comes in the form of the Italian winner of this year’s Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, The Great Beauty. Paolo Sorrentino’s thoughtful, sensuous film has drawn comparisons to the work of Federico Fellini, which is understandable: its central figure, successful one-time novelist Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), is a charming fixture in Rome’s social scene who, on the night of his 65th birthday, finds himself wandering the city streets and reflecting on his life. The result is a timeless portrait of Rome and its nightlife, framed by gorgeous cinematography and backed by an evocative score. Though critics concede The Great Beauty‘s strengths lie in its lush, stylish images rather than its narrative, most found the visuals so striking that they overcame any thematic shortcomings, and the film sits at a Certified Fresh 91% on the Tomatometer. The Criterion DVD/Blu-ray combo includes interviews with Sorrentino, Servillo, and co-writer Umberto Contarello, as well as some deleted scenes.Delivery Man 40%Vince Vaughn’s a pretty likable guy, and he often uses that to his advantage, playing characters we might otherwise find annoying in real life but for the fact that he’s just so charming. In Delivery Man, a remake of Canadian film Starbuck, Vaughn plays David Wozniak, a delivery man (of course) for his family’s butcher shop who discovers he’s fathered 533 children via sperm donations he made in college, and that 142 of them have filed a lawsuit demanding his identity be revealed. Unfortunately for Vaughn, his relatable everyman persona only went so far in Delivery Man, as critics couldn’t help but compare the film to its source material and found a bit too predictable and schmaltzy to measure up. At 39% on the Tomatometer, it isn’t a big winner by any means, but if you’re just looking for something super sweet and you don’t mind a bit of telegraphed comedy, this might make a good rental.Also available this week:The Punk Singer (83%), a documentary about Kathleen Hanna, the lead singer of Bikini Kill and Le Tigre who became a feminist icon.Odd Thomas (34%), starring Anton Yelchin in a Dean Koontz novel adaptation about a fry cook who can see dead people and leaps into action to thwart an apocalyptic evil who’s arrived in his small town.The Truth About Emanuel (28%), starring Jessica Biel and Alfred Molina in a thriller about a woman who becomes obsessed with her new neighbor, who looks just like her dead mother.Welcome to the Jungle (25%), starring Jean-Claude Van Damme in an action comedy about a corporate retreat in the wilderness gone awry.Walking with Dinosaurs (25%), a CGI film based on the BBC Earth series of the same name, featuring dinosaurs of the Late Cretaceous period.Season two of HBO’s Veep (83%), starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus in a comedy about the trials of a put-upon female vice president and her eccentric staff.Season six of Showtime’s Californication, starring David Duchovny as a lecherous, alcoholic novelist trying to navigate his various relationships.And in addition to The Great Beauty, the Criterion Collection is also releasing new DVD/Blu-ray combo packs of Ingmar Bergman’s Persona (92%) and the 1925 Harold Lloyd film The Freshman (88%).","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Exclusive, dark, Watching, of, 2021, nightmare, Black, Month, 4/20, thriller, Video, documentary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-the-wolf-of-wall-street-delivery-man-and-more"},{"id":"47612934208866","title":"Robert Englund’s Stuck-At-Home Binge Guide: True Terrors and Fairy Tales to Watch Now","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Robert Englund's Stuck-At-Home Binge Guide: True Terrors and Fairy Tales to Watch NowOne, two, Freddy's coming for you... with some excellent creepy recommendations for what to watch while you're hanging at the homestead.by Aaron Pruner | March 18, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by Travel Channel)Social distancing can be a nightmare.

The 72-year-old actor pivots from the world of horror fiction to that of bizarre fact when he begins his run as host of&nbsp;Travel Channel’s&nbsp;new historical anthology series, True Terror With Robert Englund.Featuring reenactments of news articles and tabloid stories from the 19th and early 20th centuries, Englund describes the new series as Unsolved Mysteries meets Ripley’s Believe It or Not!, and with tales that include Teddy Roosevelt’s Sasquatch sighting to the rampage of New Orleans’&nbsp;Axeman — the serial killer was portrayed by Danny Huston in American Horror Story: Coven — it’s easy to see that some of these stories&nbsp;will get pretty wild.Englund acts as the narrative glue to the series.“I bring a little bit of my Vincent Price attitude and with the little bits of the Rod Serling rhythms in the writing that I get to play with, we kind of echo Unsolved Mysteries, but for a 21st-century audience with 21st-century sensibilities,” he told&nbsp;Rotten Tomatoes. “What does that creepy, that underbelly, that dark side mean to a more contemporary audience as opposed to a more innocent audience back in the day?”He may be known for portraying monsters and killers on the big screen, but much like contemporary audiences the world over, Englund is a fan of binge-watching. And of the many genres available at the click of a button, Nordic criminal dramas (like Bordertown) is one of his absolute favorites.“I love Scandinavian serial killer shows,” he said. “Or as I call them, ‘Blood and Snow with Volvos.’ They’re always really dark and really good.”Read on for&nbsp;Englund’s bingeable list of&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;programming.Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019)  98%I use subtitles when I’m watching those Scandinavian shows, or a favorite like Peaky Blinders, whenever there’s access, because I want to learn the names, especially if they’re foreign names. It’s really opened a whole new world to me. I think that was something we all learned from the Oscars. You know, when Bong Joon-ho was so grateful for people using their subtitles for Parasite. People aren’t afraid of subtitles anymore. I love that movie, and I wouldn’t want to miss that for the world.Blue Ruin (2014)  96%Blue Ruin, oh man.&nbsp;It’s directed by Jeremy Saulnier, and just — oh my god, this guy! He’s got some great stuff, this guy. He’s working with a whole group of people out of North Carolina that are just making some extraordinary stuff. They’re really talented people.Penny Dreadful  91%The English series takes place in turn-of-the-century London. It has Dorian Gray, Dracula and Renfield, the Wolfman, and Dr. Frankenstein — along with both of his Frankenstein creations — and they’re all in Jack the Ripper London, together. It’s with Eva Green, and it’s just phenomenal.Hold the Dark (2018)  70%The dark little horror movie is, I think, maybe a year/a year-and-a-half old. Jeffrey Wright&nbsp;from Westworld&nbsp;is the star. And it’s got Alexander Skarsgård, the guy from True Blood and Big Little Lies. So it’s got that guy, Jeffrey Wright, and the granddaughter of Elvis Presley, Riley Keough. Skarsgård and Keough are a white-trash couple living in a trailer park on this Indian Reservation in Alaska. They’ve been indoctrinated, seduced, and recruited into a Native American wolf cult. To keep their child out of the cult, they send for Jeffrey Wright, who’s an expert at this type of stuff. It’s this amazing, dark, crazy movie. And it’s like nobody’s seen it but me. It has the single best shootout in the history of American cinema — or the history of cinema period.Carnival Row  56%I’m surprised that more of the Harry Potter&nbsp;fans, the Game of Thrones&nbsp;fans, the Lord of the Rings fans, and the fantasy fans haven’t been attracted to this show. What’s it about? Well let me put it this way: “fairy” is a dirty word on the show. So it’s a world where fairies are real, but they’re like slaves. It’s this kind of industrial, rebellious, steampunk world. It has humans and it has fairies, and it has another caste of people who have ram’s horns on their heads.Hinterland I just started watching this weird, dark, Welsh one. It’s about a London cop who’s the fish out of water. And he’s got some secrets that we don’t really know yet, but everybody’s very, very real. And it’s real creepy, incestuous, and strange.True Terror with Robert Englund premieres&nbsp;Wednesday, March 18 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on the Travel Channel","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"dramedy, Sundance, space, know, Arts, america","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"true-terror-robert-englund-binge-guide"},{"id":"47613014440319","title":"RT’s Oscar Picks 2013 – Results","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT's Oscar Picks 2013 - ResultsHow did we fare this year in our Academy Awards predictions?by RT Staff | February 25, 2013 |  CommentsWe at Rotten Tomatoes freely admit we’re not the world’s greatest Oscar prognosticators. Still, we did a bit better than usual this year; while there were some surprises (Sound Editing was a tie?!) and a few winners that aren’t all that surprising in retrospect, most of our predictions came true at the 85th Annual Academy Awards. Read on to see how our forecast squared with the final results! 96%Best Picture: ArgoMomentum has been building for Argo in the past few weeks; it took home best picture honors at the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs, and the Critics’ Choice Awards (and not to toot our own horns, but it won the Golden Tomato Award for Best Wide Release as well). Argo hits several sweet spots that the Academy voters find irresistible: it’s inspirational, but loaded with historical gravitas; it was both a mainstream hit and a critical favorite; and, perhaps most importantly for voters, it’s a celebration of the power of movies and the people who make them. Lincoln and Silver Linings Playbook have enjoyed some dark horse cache, but we think Argo will be the first film since Driving Miss Daisy to win Best Picture without garnering a Best Director nod.CORRECTLincoln 89%Best Actor: Daniel Day-Lewis for LincolnThis category has been in the bag since the ink was dry on Daniel Day-Lewis’ contract.CORRECTSilver Linings Playbook 92%Best Actress: Jennifer Lawrence for Silver Linings PlaybookThis was the toughest category for RT editors to whittle down. At opposite ends of the age bracket, Emmanuelle Riva and Quvenzhané Wallis each gave remarkable performances, and Riva in particular could muster some votes. Even more likely is Naomi Watts, whose physically grueling work in The Impossible has also generated buzz. Early on, it looked like Jessica Chastain had this category all sewn up, as critics societies around the country were heaping praise on her. However, in the last couple months, all the Oscar mojo has seemingly shifted toward Jennifer Lawrence; with a Golden Globe, a Critics Choice, and a SAG award under her belt, we think Lawrence will walk away with the Oscar as well.CORRECTLincoln 89%Best Supporting Actor: Tommy Lee Jones for LincolnEach of the nominees has an Oscar to his credit, so there aren’t any unjustly ignored sentimental favorites to choose from. Christoph Waltz won the BAFTA and the Golden Globe, but it seems unlikely he’ll win just a few short years after his breakout role in Inglourious Basterds. Robert DeNiro has a strong chance, especially since his work in Silver Linings Playbook helped to erase memories of the great actor’s string of mediocre films. However, we think Tommy Lee Jones – who was already honored by the Screen Actors Guild –will ultimately claim the Oscar.INCORRECT – Christoph Waltz, Django Unchained. We shouldn’t have discounted Waltz’s previous award season victories.Les Misérables 70%Best Supporting Actress: Anne Hathaway for Les MisérablesAnne Hathaway has enjoyed almost universal Oscar buzz since before Les Misérables even hit theaters, and her wins at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs confirm her status as the front-runner here. It’s possible, though unlikely, that either Helen Hunt or Jacki Weaver will steal this category; if Weaver wins, it could be an early sign that Silver Linings Playbook will have a huge night.CORRECTLincoln 89%Best Director: Steven Spielberg for LincolnSince Ben Affleck was inexplicably snubbed in this category, we think Steven Spielberg will take home the hardware as a consolation prize.INCORRECT – Ang Lee, Life of Pi. It just wasn’t Lincoln‘s night, and the Academy was obviously more enamored with Life of Pi overall. It’s still a mystery why Ben Affleck wasn’t even nominated in this category. 87%Original Screenplay: Django UnchainedThe Usual Suspects, Fargo, Lost in Translation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Juno… The screenplay awards are the place where the Academy honors innovative stuff that’s a little too wild and wooly for Best Picture. Quentin Tarantino’s consolation prize for Pulp Fiction losing to Forrest Gump was a Best Original Screenplay trophy, and he’ll pick up another one for Django Unchained this year.CORRECT 96%Adapted Screenplay: ArgoFollowing up on the last entry, we must make note of the fact that because there are two screenplay awards, it makes sense that one goes to something a little left of center, and the other goes to whatever won Best Picture. So chalk up Argo for the Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay).CORRECT 93%Best Foreign Language Film: AmourGiven that Amour was also nominated for Best Picture (not to mention noms for Michael Haneke in the direction and screenwriting categories), this one seems like a lock.CORRECT 95%Best Documentary: Searching for Sugar ManThis was another contentious award for RT editors. In a year of particularly strong choices, we think it’s down to a three-way race between Searching for Sugar Man, The Invisible War, and The Gatekeepers, with the feel-good vibes of Sugar Man carrying the day over its more somber, issue-oriented peers.CORRECT 78%Animated Feature: BraveAnother tough call. We think the competition is ultimately between Brave and Wreck-It Ralph. However, because graying Academy voters can’t tell Call of Duty from The Call of the Wild, we’re gonna go with the little redhead. (It must be noted that RT editor-in-chief Matt Atchity insists Frankenweenie will win, loudly telling the rest of the staff, “You’re all wrong.” Sure thing, chief.)CORRECT 86%Best Cinematography: Life of PiLife of Pi‘s visual splendor is so mind-blowing that it seems improbable that anyone could steal this category from its cinematographer, Claudio Miranda.CORRECT 96%Best Film Editing: ArgoArgo already took home the BAFTA in this category, and we think three-time nominee William Goldenberg will add to the film’s Oscar haul.CORRECT 89%Best Music – Original Score: LincolnJohn Williams is one of the most nominated figures in Academy history, and hasn’t won in a long time. We think he’ll win Oscar number six, but Mychael Danna’s eclectic score for Life of Pi could surprise some people.INCORRECT – Life of Pi. We had a feeling Mychael Danna could steal this one, especially since John Williams has so many Oscars to his name already. 92%Best Music – Original Song: SkyfallThese days, award shows exist for one reason, and one reason alone: to bestow trophies upon Adele.CORRECT 63%Best Production Design: Anna KareninaThis looks like a tossup between Anna Karenina and Les Misérables. We decided to go with the period piece based on a classic novel. And when we realized we were being forced to choose between two period pieces based on classic novels, we picked Anna Karenina, because Leo Tolstoy had cooler facial hair than Victor Hugo.INCORRECT – Lincoln. We got this one completely wrong. Probably should have considered the painstakingly recreated period detail of Civil War-era Washington. 63%Best Costume Design: Anna KareninaTake this one to the bank, comrades.CORRECT 91%Best Sound Editing: Zero Dark ThirtyThe controversy over Zero Dark Thirty‘s politics have hurt its Oscar chances in a number of categories. Still, few questioned the film’s technical brilliance, and we think it’s here that Zero Dark Thirty will take home the hardware.HALF CORRECT – Ties are rare in Oscar history, but not unprecedented. Zero Dark Thirty split the honor with Skyfall. 70%Best Sound Mixing: Les MisérablesA big deal was made about the fact that the cast of Les Misérables sang their songs live on camera. That’s pretty tough to record, especially with canons going off everywhere.CORRECT 86%Best Visual Effects: Life of PiDude, remember the tiger in that movie? It was all CGI. Pretty cool, huh?CORRECT 64%Best Makeup and Hairstyling: The Hobbit: An Unexpected JourneyThose ears didn’t get pointy all by themselves.INCORRECT – Les Misérables. We were so focused on the pointy ears we neglected to take note of the grit and grime that accumulated on the faces of the actors portraying 19th Century Gauls.Best Short Film – Live Action: CurfewAn idiosyncratic dramedy about a depressed writer tasked with babysitting his precocious niece, Curfew has racked up a bunch of festival awards, and we think it will add an Oscar to its haul.CORRECTBest Short Film – Animated: PapermanPaperman is the wistful tale of an office drone who goes to great lengths to reconnect with a beautiful woman he glimpsed on the subway. It’s sweet, it’s beautifully animated, and it had the benefit of being the opening act for Wreck-It Ralph in theaters.CORRECTBest Documentary Short: Open HeartThis is a particularly solemn year for documentary shorts. We think Open Heart, the tale of eight Rwandan children traveling to Sudan for heart surgery, will earn both tears and votes from Academy members.INCORRECT – Inocente, the story of a homeless girl who dreams of becoming an artist, took home the Oscar.FINAL TALLYCORRECT: 18INCORRECT: 6For our full Oscar coverage on the day, go to RT’s Awards Tour pageWritten by Tim Ryan","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Baby, Comedy, Sundance, Kids, on","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rts-oscar-picks-2013-results"},{"id":"47612945526118","title":"Best Movies Off the Radar 2013","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Best Movies Off the Radar 2013RT staffers pick the little-seen gems from 2013 that deserve another look.by RT Staff | December 27, 2013 |  CommentsIt’s the end of the year, a magical time in which critics and awards voters are hard at work making their selections for the finest that cinema had to offer. However, we at RT decided to take a slightly different tack. We’re giving some love to a few of the overlooked, underappreciated, and, in some cases, critically dismissed movies that made an impression on us. Read on for a rundown of lesser-known gems from 2013 that we think deserve another look. 77%Simon KillerTim Ryan, Senior EditorWhen we first meet Simon (Brady Corbet), he’s explaining to an acquaintance what he’s doing in Paris: he’s a recent graduate who’s in Europe trying to clear his head after a bad breakup with his long-term girlfriend. At first, he seems like a decent, intelligent guy, but it doesn’t take long for us to notice that something is a bit… off about him. We watch him lie about seemingly trivial things. Then we see him manipulate people, most notably Victoria (Mati Diop), an escort who clearly has feelings for him. Then we watch as he becomes a blackmailer and scammer. Then… well, no spoilers, but the movie’s called Simon Killer for a reason. Movie psychopaths tend to be diabolical and charming, but what makes Simon truly frightening is that he’s nothing like Hannibal Lecter or Patrick Bateman; instead, he epitomizes what Hervey M. Cleckley called “the mask of sanity.” Simon Killer is a slow-burning character study that’s not pleasant to watch, but it’s fascinating regardless. Director Antonio Campos’ visual sense is assured but unobtrusive, and he maintains a dispassionate tone that allows us to observe a monster without distraction or embellishment. It’s an uncommonly audacious and disturbing film. 60%John Dies at the EndGrae Drake, Senior EditorThis film adaptation of David Wong’s ridiculously off-the-wall book is all about Soy Sauce — but this stuff doesn’t come for free from a Chinese food place. It’s actually a drug that sends its users across time and dimensions, really giving them their money’s worth. Unfortunately, it simultaneously makes them inhuman. In every kind of body-snatchers-y type story, you need a hero with their feet planted firmly on the ground to save the world. Instead of that, you get John and David. They’re not the type of guys you want saving us from certain destruction — but that’s what makes this movie fun. John Dies at the End is directed by Don Coscarelli of Bubba Ho-Tep fame, and it features performances by Chase Williamson, Rob Mayes, and Paul Giamatti that are rock-solid, bizarre, and much better than one might expect from an indie movie about drugs named after condiments. Check this one out, and buckle up. 94%A Band Called DeathRyan Fujitani, EditorEvery year, there are a number of noteworthy documentaries that some might say go criminally underseen, and 2013 was no different. One of the mid-year triumphs of the genre, A Band Called Death gestated in distribution limbo after its 2012 LA Film Festival premiere until it finally saw a limited release in June of 2013. The film chronicles the formation, marginal success, and subsequent rediscovery of a proto-punk band comprised of an unlikely trio — three black brothers from the heart of Detroit. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, while their contemporaries were getting their funk on, Motown style, David, Dannis, and Bobby Hackney dared to play fast, trippy rock and roll, inspired by the likes of Alice Cooper and The Who. Unfortunately, this band called Death failed to gain much traction due to its controversial name, and, unwilling to compromise his artistic integrity, David, the eldest Hackney and visionary leader of the band, eventually succumbed to alcoholism. While the film does chart the musical successes and failures of the Hackneys’ professional careers, it’s also a tender, sometimes heartbreaking testament to the power of family bonds, adding a profound humanistic touch to a story that would nevertheless have been a fascinating rock doc in its own right. 83%LeviathanLuke Goodsell, International EditorGotta admit, I’m not really sure for whom certain movies are “on” or “off” the radar, because this was certainly one of my most anticipated of the year. Nonetheless, with only a handful of screens and less than $100,000 at the US box office, I’m guessing Leviathan qualifies. A lot of documentaries claim to trade in “objectivity,” but this one really is as close as a movie can get to purity. Directors Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Verena Paravel attached GoPro cameras to everything they could on a North Atlantic fishing trawler — rigs, nets, fisherman, you name it — and the result is cinema like you’ve never seen before. It’s queasy viewing at times, to be sure — hilariously, there were a lot of walkouts at my screening, presumably from people who thought they’d paid to see a gentle nature doc about seagulls — but for anyone into adventurous, next wave moviemaking, this is the real deal. 31%Gangster SquadAlex Vo, EditorDespite the big-name cast (Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone) and Zombieland‘s Reuben Fleischer in the director’s chair, Warner Bros had to steer Gangster Squad under the radar. Originally set as a late 2012 summer release, Gangster Squad‘s trailer had gentlemen in trench coats blasting Tommy guns through a movie theater screen, a trailer that was seen by every victim of the Aurora, Colorado Dark Knight tragedy. Subsequently, WB pushed Gangster Squad out to January and shot a new ending. The movie is a quirky cocktail: the wardrobe and production capture the smoky, languid flavor of L.A. noire, but the storytelling is strictly western classic. Mythic heroes, public showdowns, children in the crosshairs, and even a sharp-shooter cop in the form of Robert Patrick complete with revolver holster and cowboy hat. It’s not perfect by any means, but Gangster Squad is a unique ode to classic genres. 93%This Is Martin BonnerJeff Giles, Associate EditorIt tells far too quiet and uneventful a tale to make much of an impact at the box office during our tentpole-driven times, but for those who can hold their craving for CG spectacle at bay for 90 minutes or so, This Is Martin Bonner offers some of the most richly rewarding filmmaking you’re liable to see in 2013. Driven by Chad Hartigan’s empathetic direction and powered by a pair of note-perfect performances from Paul Eenhoorn and Richmond Arquette, Bonner offers a gentle plea for acceptance — not only of other humans with their idiosyncrasies and their flaws, but of ourselves, and the way our changing relationship with the world around us can provoke unexpected circumstances. 86%Much Ado About NothingBeki Lane, Editorial CoordinatorI’m not quite sure how any Joss Whedon movie can wind up “off the radar” in 2013, but that’s exactly what happened with his adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing. Shot in secret at Whedon’s house over two quick weeks while on break from filming The Avengers, this film features many Whedon regulars, including Nathan Fillion, Clark Gregg, Sean Maher, Amy Acker, and Alexis Denisof. It was also a family affair; the movie was co-produced by his wife, Kai Cole, who also designed the home where the film is set, and the soundtrack features songs performed by his brother Jed. The result is a film that makes many bold choices: it’s filmed in black and white, it’s set in contemporary times, and it’s performed with modern American speech. It takes a few minutes for such anachronisms to settle in, but once they do, this Much Ado About Nothing is an interesting ride that keeps you engaged throughout, even if it’s just to see what they do with this unique setup. The cast’s ability with Shakespeare is varied; many are good (and Nathan Fillion is brilliant; I wish he’d been playing Benedick, but the scenes with Dogberry are hands-down the best) and a couple are painful, but that’s all part of the fun and charm if you go in understanding the intended spirit of the film. And it’s Certified Fresh at 84 percent, in case you need any extra convincing. 56%Frankenstein’s ArmyKerr Lordygan, Review AggregatorIn the final days of World War II, Russian troops discover some revolting developments in an abandoned German town. On behalf of the Nazis, Dr. Viktor and a group of scientists had been building an army of patched-together soldiers constructed from humans merged with found objects, including, in some cases, regular household appliances. No plane propeller or blender is safe! Some viewers may want to bring Dramamine to watch Frankenstein’s Army — this is a hand-held found-footage film that might induce occasional motion sickness. But I was so intrigued by the innovative creatures (the designs are terrifying) and humor (Czech actor Karel Roden is remarkable in his ability to make Dr. Frankenstein likeable) in this low-budget feature that I became a fast fan. And I didn’t even need a bucket. 66%The IcemanCatherine Pricci, Review AggregatorChris Evans as a serial killer? Sign me up! Ok, so he’s not the main character in The Iceman, but the only other time I’ve seen Evans play a bad guy was in Fierce People, so I had to check this out. Oh, and did I mention he’s barely recognizable as the ruthless hitman Mr. Freezy? Alright, let’s move on to the actual film itself. Michael Shannon brilliantly portrays Richard Kuklinski, an infamous contract killer who’s also a devoted family man. He starts out doing small jobs for Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) but after being asked to cut back, he goes out on his own to kill. That’s when he teams up with Mr. Freezy and the two are a truly dynamic serial killing duo. Shannon’s performance is fantastic — he manages to make me feel for him even after he gets caught. It was clear he loved his family and the fact that his extracurricular activities were on the illegal side tested my moral judgment when it came to his undoing. Winona Ryder stars as his wife, and there’s a surprising cameo from David Schwimmer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Freeform, batman, indie, Bowl, RT, Comedy, movies, frames, die, PlayStation, Countdown, and, football, on","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"best-movies-off-the-radar-2013"},{"id":"47617856058865","title":"Play Ball With RT’s Top Sports Movies!","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

With The Act of Killing arriving on Blu-ray and DVD this week — and collecting an Oscar-nomination for Best Documentary — we spoke with Oppenheimer on how the film has generated new forms of dialogue with audiences, the nature of what he calls “the humanity of evil,” and his conflicted relationship with his “star” — charismatic mass murderer Anwar Congo.It’s been a tremendous year for this film: people are still discussing it, it topped Sight and Sound‘s year-end poll — even though you got a bad review in the magazine. How does it feel to still be talking about The Act of Killing, all this time later?Joshua Oppenheimer: Well, above all it’s been pleasing, and a great honor, that viewers and critics — but especially viewers all over the world, above all in Indonesia but everywhere — have opened themselves to the film’s painful, mysterious, and complicated message. By allowing themselves to approach men like Anwar Congo and his friends through my intimacy with them, through my closeness with them, they choose to become close to Anwar and his friends, and see a small part of themselves in men like Anwar. I think in that moment something else happens that I think is pretty radical — the whole paradigm in which we divide up the world into good guys and bad guys collapses, and people start to ask all kinds of questions about their own humanity and the nature of evil. I think that reaction, and the courage that it takes people to go through that, is really heartening to me. Especially when that reaction has taken place in Indonesia.So yes, it’s a long time to be talking about the same thing [laughs], but I’ve learned a lot about the film through the audience. You finish a film not in the editing, but in the conversations that audiences have with themselves — and in that sense every viewer is making a slightly different film. And that’s wonderful. I’ve learned a lot. Of course, there is some repetition, but above all it’s invigorating, because the film that took eight years to make has grown millions of manifestations of itself when everyone sees it.It’s interesting that you say the film invites a dialogue with the audience, because it doesn’t take the easy path of condemning these men. What’s something you learned about the film from that dialogue — say from an audience reaction — that you perhaps didn’t think about before?Oppenheimer: That’s a really good question. How would I answer that? There’s so many things I’ve learned, but what’s the most interesting thing I’ve learned from an audience reaction? Two things, I guess, and they’re related. First of all, there was a very striking moment when someone said, “You have forgiven Anwar.” And I said, “I don’t feel that that’s my role. I don’t feel like either forgiving or condemning is my role. It’s not my purpose, for me to do that; I’m not a court.” And the viewers have corrected me there on a number of occasions, and said, “No, by seeing the human being beyond the actions, that is forgiveness. That is what forgiveness is.” And that left a pretty strong impression on me as I thought about who I am after making this film. And whatever viewer told me that — I don’t remember, for such a precious lesson it’s a pity I don’t remember who told me that — that left a strong impression on me.The other thing that’s somehow related to that is about where Anwar is at the end of the film. I’ve resisted the notion that Anwar is in any way redeemed, and I think that’s correct — I don’t think that he is redeemed. I think that some people have been quick to say that there’s this catharsis at the end. It may be cathartic for the viewer to discover in Anwar that, despite everything, there remains this indigestible residue of humanity that physically and morally rejects what he’s done. Once I was asked very, very plainly, “Does Anwar regret what he’s done?” Instead of saying “Did Anwar feel remorse?” which would involve Anwar more reflectively considering his own feelings, the question “Does he regret what he’s done?” stood out as immediately easy to answer. I said, “Yes, of course he regrets what he’s done; he’s been tormented by it for years.” That also was a discovery.And then of course, what I was trying to emphasize, the biggest discovery about the film was its capacity to stand as a mirror for people. The whole method is that it’s a dark mirror for Anwar, but it’s also a dark mirror for Indonesian society as a whole, and it’s a dark mirror for all of us. And perhaps that capacity of the film to stand as a mirror, and the willingness of people from all over the world to look into that mirror, however dark the image they see there, has been really heartening and, by implication, a real discovery for me.It’s that familiar scenario that many have commented on: the banality of evil. Because the killers are very human, it makes it possible for an audience to see themselves in them.Oppenheimer: You made a leap there, which is good, but I think that it’s worth pausing and reflecting on. The film shows something by approaching Anwar and his friends as human beings. Unless we see them as human we won’t be able to understand how we do this to each other, and the effects — how we as humans, after having done such things, live with ourselves, and the effects of the stories, the lies, we tell ourselves to justify our actions because we’re human. You talk about the banality of evil, but what I think the film is really exploring, somehow, is the humanity of evil; the involvement of our humanity and morality — not immorality — in the practice of evil. And what I mean by that is, I think one of the most frightening things the film witnesses, and you see it all the more starkly in the longer director’s cut of the film, is the way that because we’re human, after we commit atrocities we have to lie to ourselves to justify what we’ve done. And that is not a sign of our immorality, that’s a sign of our humanity, and our morality — our vulnerability to the tormenting effects of guilt.Anwar and his friends have won, and in having won they’re been part of writing a victor’s history. As one of them says in the film, If you can get away with killing and you get paid enough for it, go ahead and do it. But then you must make up an excuse so you can live with yourself afterwards, and you must cling to that excuse for dear life. Well Anwar and his friends — and there’s a whole section about the anti-communist propaganda in the longer version of the film — have clung to the lies justifying what they’re done for dear life, so that they can live with their selves. Although they know they’re false, they’ve acted as if they’re true, because that’s the only way that they can live with themselves. To maintain those lies, it inevitably leads to a downward spiral of further lies and corruption that can only end, somehow, in a moral vacuum. Now they have to blame their victims for what they’re done, because that’s what the propaganda says — that it’s the victim’s fault. They have to dehumanize the victims, because it’s much easier for them to live with themselves if the victims are not fully human in their eyes. And above all, they must kill again, or torture again, because the government now says to Anwar and his friends, “Kill this group of people, for the same reason that you killed the first group.” If they refuse, it’s equivalent to admitting it was wrong the first time.So the repetition, this hypothetical repetition that I’m talking about, happens not because Anwar is a sadistic monster who carries on blindly committing evil, but because he’s a human, and being human he knows what he’s done is wrong and he can’t cope with that. So we see here, in the longer cut of the film, in the terrible sequence of film noir scenes that culminates in Anwar playing the victim at the end. In that movement through sadism, before Anwar finds himself in the victims’ chair, I think we somehow start to feel that remorse that he starts to feel in the nightmare sequences when he burns down the village. Remorse is painful for Anwar. Instead of reacting to it with more remorse, he reacts to it with sadism. He pushes it away. He gets angry, because he feels hurt. Having killed has damaged him, and who does he blame for that? He blames the victims, and throws himself all the more readily and despairingly into his sadism, and finds himself playing the victim. If there’s a single omission from the shorter version of the film, it’s that sequence. The whole rhythm of the director’s cut, the pace, the peculiar pauses that allow you to rest after moments of real violence, the whole structure and pace is all building up to that final descent into Hell.But both versions of the film witness that so much of what we call evil may stem from our morality. And this is counter-intuitive and it’s very frightening, because it shows that not only are there not evil people among us who we could somehow deal with if we could find them, but evil is not a sectioned-off part of ourselves — it is an integral part of who we are, and it has something to do, I think, with despair, and surrender, and anger. It ultimately comes down to humanity, and in witnessing that last act in The Act of Killing, certainly in the long version, viewers are seeing “Oh no, this is who we are” in a very frightening way.Next, Oppenheimer on how he got access to the death squads to tell their stories, and his thoughts on the relationship he’s developed with Anwar Congo.The scene is frightening because, like a lot of the film, it’s mixed up in not only real terror but a very dark humor at the same time. There’s something I did want to ask you about, for the people who perhaps haven’t read this before. Going back to the beginning, you originally set out to make a documentary on the survivors of the massacres, before you were put in touch with these guys. Did you come up against any resistance? Weren’t they suspicious of you?Oppenheimer: Oh yeah, that’s right — when we began making the film. Did I come up against resistance when I started working with the perpetrators? I started this whole project working with survivors in this small plantation village, and when the army got wind of the fact that the survivors were participating in the film, they told them not to participate any more. They survivors with whom I was living said, “Okay, Josh — if you can’t film with us, before you give up you should try and film the aging death squad leaders living around us, because they may be able to tell you how our loved ones were killed.” So I approached these men — one of them was living directly across from where I was staying — I approached these men cautiously, unsure if it was safe to talk to them about the past and the killings, but to my horror every single one of them was immediately open and boastful about what they’d done. I don’t know why those first perpetrators I met weren’t suspicious of me, given that I was living with the relatives of the people they’d killed, but perhaps that coexistence was so normal to them that it didn’t signify much. Perhaps the army, not wanting to worry them, hadn’t told them that I was exploring that stuff that happened in 1965.In any case, we got away with it in the first village. Then, when I showed that footage to those survivors that wanted to see it, and the human rights community, they told me to continue. They said, “Keep filming the perpetrators, you’re on to something terribly important. Through this material you can expose the entire regime.” So I obliged and filmed every perpetrator I could find over two years, by which time I’d moved far enough away from the orbit of the small community of survivors that there wasn’t so much of a risk of people finding out what I was up to. If I was being monitored by the military or the government, I had worked myself so far up the chain of command of the perpetrators that I thinking the low-level intelligence officers — if they were monitoring me — wouldn’t dare raise suspicions with such powerful men at that level. Some of them will be in my next film, which is forthcoming. So through the process I don’t think there was much suspicion of me.What was your pitch?My pitch was very simple. As I filmed perpetrator after perpetrator they would tell me stories, often with smiles on their faces, often in front of their wives, children or little grandchildren, and then afterwards say “Hey, I can take you to the place where I killed?” and the next day we would go. At the location they would tell me what they had done and then launch into these sort of spontaneous demonstrations of how they killed, and often they would bring along props. If they’d forgotten to bring along props they would complain: “Oh, I should have brought along a machete.” Sometimes they’d bring along friends to play victims, as well. So the scene on the roof with Anwar, where he shows how he killed the wire and dances the Cha, Cha, Cha, that in fact was the very first day that I met him; that was typical of a first day of filming with a perpetrator in North Sumatra. Anwar was the 41st perpetrator I’d filmed, so by that time I’d filmed dozens, and long before I’d said to them, “Look, you’ve participated in one of the biggest killings in human history, I want to understand what it means to you and your society; you want to tell me what you’ve done, so go ahead and show me in whatever way you wish. I will film the process, but I’ll also film you and your fellow death squad members talking about preparing those reenactments. In that way I’ll make a film that shows what this means to your society, and how you want to be seen.”I could be that open with them because they were that open with me — if not about their feelings about what they’d done, but at least about the facts of what they’d done. The method was not a trick to get them to open up — this method of reenactment — it was a response to their openness, a way of trying to understand why they’re so open. I lingered on Anwar, not because I was looking for the right main character, but because his pain was close to the surface — even if he was doing something as grotesquely boastful as dancing where he’d killed hundreds of people. In fact, it’s not boastful — it’s a manifestation of radical denial. I started to intuit that his boasting was not really a sign of pride, but a sign of the opposite — that all of these men know what they’ve done is wrong. They’re boasting because they’ve never been forced to admit it was wrong by some invading army or a court.The oblivion that Anwar and Herman exist in often makes them come off like big kids. It reminded me a little of Idi Amin. Did you ever see the Barbet Schroeder documentary on him?Oppenheimer: Yeah, it’s wonderful. One of my very, very favorite films.In that film, even though you know what Amin’s up to, you can’t help but laugh because he’s very charming — albeit in an entirely deranged manner. I felt a little of that in Anwar, although, as you say, you can see the denial bubbling under.Oppenheimer: I’ve always talked about that humanity, but I think with Idi Amin there’s something else going on with his enjoying an act. There’s a way with which Idi Amin is filmed enjoying an act. And Anwar is enjoying his act, and enjoying acting in the film, but because he’s told us that he would walk out of the cinema, out of an Elvis Presley vehicle in 1965, and enjoy the intoxication of his cinematic identification with Elvis and dance across the street and kill happily, there’s a kind of radical denial into which Anwar slips, into which I slip with him, as he enjoyed the act of making the film much in the same way as he would have enjoyed the act he had to throw himself into in order to carry out the act of killing.There’s a very strong sense that you’re empathizing with Anwar as the film progresses, and I know that you’ve stayed in touch with him. Did you find yourself at a point where you were enjoying making this film? Not in the sense that you were enjoying the subject matter, but that perhaps you had warmed to Anwar’s company.Oppenheimer: There were many levels of enjoyment in making the film. I had the most wonderful Indonesian crew. They were my second family and dearest friends. We had a lot of fun making this film, although it was very painful as well. The making of this film gave many of us pretty tough nightmares and insomnia and so on. Of course I could enjoy Anwar as another human being: he’s funny, he’s charming; you’ve seen it in the film. That open view to Anwar is an essential part of how the film works. We open to Herman and Anwar because they’re funny, they’re generous, they’re charming — and then they do something terrible, and we’re forced to confront the humanity of evil. I opened to him as well. I think I had to, in order to deal honestly with him as a human being. I made a decision that I would never make the leap from thinking because Anwar has done something monstrous I will treat Anwar as a monster at all times; I will treat him as human at all times. And to treat someone as human is to be open to them and allow yourself to be close to them and be charmed by them or to like them. So of course I liked Anwar at times; of course I liked parts of Anwar. The frightening aspect of that is what that reveals: that liking somebody — whether someone’s likeable or nice — is wholly immaterial. In fact, being likeable and nice may make it easier for some people to commit evil. It’s the very thing I was saying earlier: committing evil does not depend on being a monster. And yet I will say one thing as well. I would feel a deep internal resistance every time I would have to go back to Anwar unexpectedly. If, say at the end of a day of shooting I’d forgotten something at his house and I had to go back and collect it, or if I had to call Anwar an extra times, or if I had to go visit — and even now I stay in touch with him; I want to stay in touch with him; I care for him — I’m conflicted about it.The Act of Killing is released on Blu-ray and DVD this week, and is available through iTunes, Netflix and VOD.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Awards, Fresh, Brie, Skip, heist, of, Tumblr, TV+, Classic, camera, slashers, Games, golden, CBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"interview-oscarnominated-act-of-killing-director-on-the-humanity-of-evil"},{"id":"47612997762424","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-ray: Haywire and Joyful Noise","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-ray: Haywire and Joyful NoisePlus, a music legend's biopic, Madonna's latest directorial effort, and something for Tim Burton fans.by Ryan Fujitani | May 1, 2012 |  CommentsThis week on home video brings us a couple of gems and a couple of duds. Some notable Blu-ray reissues hit stores this week: Clueless, Men in Black II, Jeremiah Johnson, Pillow Talk, and About a Boy. But we’ll be focusing on the brand new releases, which include Steven Soderbergh’s gritty actioner, Garry Marshall’s latest holiday-themed rom-com, a gospel musical, Madonna’s second directorial effort, a Beatle biopic, and a collection of Tim Burton’s Warner Bros. films. See below for the whole shebang.Haywire 80%Steven Soderbergh expanded his resume to cover the action genre with Haywire, and the result was a critical (if not quite commercial) success. Soderbergh spotted MMA fighter Gina Carano on television and approached her about doing a film, specifically about a government contract operative (Carano) who is double crossed and must uncover the truth about the betrayal. With Soderbergh at the helm, Carano performing all of her own stunts, and a top notch supporting cast, Haywire earned a Certified Fresh 80% and provided an early-year adrenaline boost for moviegoers.New Year’s Eve 7%If critics were unkind to Garry Marshall’s last holiday-themed ensemble rom-com, Valentine’s Day (18% Tomatometer), they displayed downright contempt for New Year’s Eve, a similarly constructed collection of loosely interconnected stories populated by famous people like Halle Berry, Robert De Niro, Ashton Kutcher, and Sarah Jessica Parker, among many others. New Year’s Eve earned a paltry 7% on the Tomatometer, leaving many to wonder if Marshall might finally achieve the rare 0% with his next feature. Arbor Day, maybe, or Ash Wednesday if we’re really lucky.Joyful Noise 32%Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton make an interesting, if unlikely, duo in Joyful Noise as two women battling to decide the direction of their competition-level church choir. Critics sung the praises of the film’s two leads, whose chemistry — along with a few solid musical numbers — was one of the few good things about Joyful Noise. It’s not subtle, and it doesn’t do anything you wouldn’t expect from a feelgood musical film, but if you’re looking for a simple, pleasant time-waster, there are those who would say you could do worse.W.E. 12%Everyone ultimately wants “to direct,” and Madonna is no different. Her first effort, 2008’s Filth and Wisdom, was considered ambitious but wildly incoherent, and if you thought she couldn’t do much worse, critics say you’re wrong. W.E., about a young woman (Abbie Cornish) obsessed with the romance between King Edward VIII and his American divorcee lover, earned a 13% from critics, who again offered up a chorus of, “It’s ambitious and it’s got style, but she doesn’t really know what she’s doing here.” The movie intercuts between the present and the past, but it’s a convention you’ve likely seen pulled off more effectively elsewhere.George Harrison: Living in the Material World 86%When former Beatle George Harrison died in 2001, his wife Olivia turned away various would-be documentarians, explaining that he had wished his story to be told through videos from his personal archive. Then came Martin Scorsese, who earned Mrs. Harrison’s blessing and slowly began to piece together what would eventually air on HBO in two parts as George Harrison: Living in the Material World. The response was overwhelmingly positive, earning an 89% on the Tomatometer and inspiring critics to call it not only an insightful and fascinating rock doc, but also a worthy entry in Scorsese’s filmography.Tim Burton Collection – Blu-RayArriving exclusively on Amazon is a new Blu-ray collection of director Tim Burton’s work, featuring movies made under the Warner Brothers banner. While this means a few of his most beloved films, like Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, won’t be included, there are still some good picks here, like Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure, Batman, and Beetlejuice, along with Batman Returns, Mars Attacks!, Corpse Bride, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The set also comes with a “premium hardcover book,” making this a decent pickup for die hard Burton fans.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Turner, cancelled, VOD, 72, action, thriller, USA, Series, streaming, comic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-haywire-and-joyful-noise"},{"id":"47613046068616","title":"Awards Tour 2012: Writers Guild of America Awards Nominations","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Awards Tour 2012: Writers Guild of America Awards Nominationsby RT Staff | January 5, 2012 |  CommentsThe Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) and the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) have announced nominations for outstanding achievement in writing for the screen during 2011.

Whether you’re looking for dumb fun, Academy darlings, arthouse favorites, or something for the kids, we’re sure you’ll like the selection hitting stores tomorrow. We’ll just start off by listing the five (that’s right, five) Certified Fresh new releases: The Descendants, The Adventures of Tintin, Melancholia, My Week with Marilyn, and Young Adult. Not bad, eh? Then we’ve got two not-so-well-reviewed films, but they’re both geared towards the younger demographic, so that may not matter. And lastly, we’ve got a controversial Scorsese film getting a shiny hi-def upgrade in the Criterion Collection. See below for the full list!The Descendants 87%We kick off this week with an Oscar-winner, made by and starring previous Oscar-winners, and though The Descendants only took home one of the five trophies for which it was nominated, most still agree it’s a thoughtful drama worth watching. Best Actor nominee George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawaii about to complete a significant family real estate deal when his wife suffers a boating accident that leaves her in a coma with no hope of waking. With his wife now hospitalized and on the verge of passing, Matt must reconnect with their two daughters, come to terms with the fact that his wife was unfaithful to him, and decide whether or not to go through with the land sale. Based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and directed by Academy Award-winner Alexander Payne (Sideways), The Descendants not only nabbed the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, but also earned a Certified Fresh 89% on the Tomatometer, with critics calling it funny, moving, and beautifully acted. Kudos also went to young Shailene Woodley, playing Matt’s older daughter, and the supporting cast is solid all-around.The Adventures of Tintin 74%Up next, another Oscar nominee (for Best Original Score) and Steven Spielberg’s first foray into motion capture technology, The Adventures of Tintin. An animated 3D spectacle, Tintin is based on a series of classic Belgian comics bearing the same title, and features a young journalist (Tintin, voiced by Jamie Bell) and his faithful dog sidekick Snowy as they travel the globe in search of a sunken treasure from the 17th Century. Featuring an all-star voice cast that includes Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost, Tintin drew comparisons to an earlier Spielberg franchise starring a certain treasure-hunting Archaeology professor by the name of “Indiana,” which could be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. Fortunately, most critics chose to look at it as a good thing, and the film earned a Certified Fresh 74%, marking it as a nice little animated throwback to classic adventure serials with some serious visuals to boot.Happy Feet Two 45%Back in 2006, WB had a hit with Happy Feet, an animated film about an emperor penguin named Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood) who couldn’t sing worth a lick, but who could tap dance his tail off. Fast forward five years, and the inevitable sequel, Happy Feet Two, hit theaters last November. This time around, Mumble is all grown up with a kid of his own, Erik (Ava Acres), who refuses to dance like his papa and runs away, only to meet Sven (Hank Azaria), a unique penguin who can fly. When the entire population of emperor penguins is trapped by an iceberg, Mumble must bring all his friends together to save the day and win back his son’s respect. Unfortunately, while the first film was Certified Fresh and took home the Oscar for Best Animated Film, critics weren’t too thrilled with Happy Feet Two, calling its narrative noisy and incoherent, even if its animation was expectedly top notch. At 44%, it’s not terrible, but it won’t be taking home any awards either.My Week with Marilyn 83%Michelle Wiliams sure has come a long way since her days on network television. The former Dawson’s Creek star has come into her own, and her feature film career of late has proven her to be an indie movie darling, with acclaimed roles in films like Wendy and Lucy and Blue Valentine. Her latest is a turn as iconic starlet Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn, a profile of the week she spent with filmmaker Colin Clark (played by Eddie Redmayne), fresh out of college on his first movie gig as an assistant director to Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) on 1957’s The Prince and the Showgirl. The nuanced portrayal of the Hollywood legend earned Williams her third Oscar nomination (and second specifically for Best Actress), and Kenneth Branagh earned his second for acting (Best Supporting Actor), though neither took home the statue. At a Certified Fresh 84% on the Tomatometer, My Week with Marilyn is worth seeing, if only for the fantastic performances.The Three Musketeers 26%Paul W.S. Anderson’s name isn’t exactly synonymous with what one might call “quality cinema;” despite the fact that the Resident Evil franchise (only two installments of which Anderson directed) has gained a cult following, he has never been behind the camera of a Fresh movie. So it was no surprise that his rock ’em, sock ’em 3D update of Alexandre Dumas’ The Three Musketeers was met with tepid reviews; even the Oscar-winning talent of Christoph Waltz could do little to save it. The story, pretty much recycled and beefed up with big action sequences and CGI, is familiar: Brash, young D’artagnan (Logan Lerman) must team up with the titular trio (Ray Stevenson, Matthew MacFayden, Luke Evans) to take down the scheming Cardinal Richelieu (Waltz), who has disbanded the musketeers. Throw in a big supporting cast that includes Orlando Bloom, Mads Mikkelsen, Milla Jovovich, Juno Temple, Til Schweiger and more, and one would think it had a chance. Unfortunately, critics found Anderson’s The Three Musketeers had nothing new to set it apart from the long line of adaptations that preceded it, yet executed what it did have so poorly that it earned a meager 26% on the Tomatometer. In other words, almost any other version is probably better than this one.Melancholia 80%Danish director Lars von Trier (Breaking the Waves, Dogville) got into a bit of trouble last year when he made some controversial comments at the Cannes Film Festival, where he had previously enjoyed a great deal of success with his films. It’s unfortunate, because the film he premiered there, Melancholia, was well received, even earning its lead, Kirsten Dunst, the festival’s award for Best Actress. The film, split into halves, focuses on two sisters — Justine (Dunst), whose wedding reception makes up the first half of the film, and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), in whose house the reception is held and where Justine spends the second half of the movie suffering from depression. At the same time, Earth is on a collision course with another planet called Melancholia, guaranteeing the end of human life, and each character finds different ways to cope. Melancholia earned a Certified Fresh 78% on the Tomatometer, bolstered primarily by Dunst’s powerhouse performance and by von Trier’s distinct and personal vision of depression and destruction. It’s not what you would call a “feelgood” movie, but it’s poignant and beautifully shot, for those who are interested.Young Adult 80%Jason Reitman’s got quite the streak going. After achieving critical success with his debut (Thank You for Smoking) in 2005, Reitman proved he wasn’t a one-hit wonder by earning Academy love for his next two films, Juno and Up in the Air. In his latest effort, Young Adult, Charlize Theron stars as Mavis Gary, a selfish, self-absorbed former prom queen-turned-writer who returns to her hometown in hopes of winning back her happily married high school sweetheart (Patrick Wilson), instead reconnecting with a former classmate (Patton Oswalt) she barely remembers. Working from a script by Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody, Young Adult drummed up a little bit of early awards buzz, but ultimately got no love, despite a Certified Fresh 81% on the Tomatometer. Some have speculated that audiences didn’t quite know how to respond to the film’s bittersweet themes, and Mavis is such an unlikable character that it may have turned off others. At the end of the day, most agreed that Theron’s performance was outstanding and that the story is both funny and powerful enough in its examination of prolonged adolescence to warrant a watch.The Last Temptation of Christ – Criterion Collection Blu-Ray 81%The Last Temptation of Christ remains Martin Scorsese’s most controversial film to date; a scene in which Jesus (Willem Defoe), in a dream, forsakes the cross to marry Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) drew thunderous protests from religious groups before the movie was even released in 1989. However, The Last Temptation of Christ was hardly an empty provocation; while the film deviates from Scripture, it’s a sincere, deeply-felt attempt by Scorsese, a dedicated Catholic, to explore the mysteries inherent in Jesus’ tale — most notably, the grey area between his divinity and his humanity. The Last Temptation of Christ is austere, serious moviemaking, and though it isn’t always easy to watch, it’s a brilliant example of Scorsese’s ability make transcendent cinema out of inner tumult. The new Criterion Blu-ray contains plenty of bonus goodies, including an audio commentary from Scorsese, Dafoe, and screenwriters Paul Schrader and Jay Cocks, on-set footage shot by Scorsese, and an interview with Peter Gabriel, who composed the film’s score.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"docudrama, Freeform, of, on, DC, the, crossover, serial, christmas, strong, movies, high","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-The-Descendants-Tintin-and-More"},{"id":"47613016393088","title":"2013 Academy Awards Winners","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})2013 Academy Awards Winnersby RT Staff | February 24, 2013 |  CommentsThe 85th Academy Awards are scheduled to take place on Sunday, February 24th in Los Angeles, and if you’re looking for the winners, you’ve come to the right place.

The biggest news we have is that Martin Scorsese’s latest, a family film and loving tribute to the cinema, is available tomorrow, after having taken home five statues last night. After that, we’ve got a spy spoof sequel, a failed bromance (of sorts), a critically acclaimed Mexican drama, and a new Criterion edition of a Louis Malle film. See below for the full list!Hugo 93%The 84th Academy Awards are officially in our collective rear view mirror, and though Hugo didn’t take home statues for any of the top honors, Martin Scorsese’s love letter to the cinema did score a solid five Oscars (Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, and Visual Effects). Based on the best-selling Brian Selznick novel, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, the film stars Asa Butterfield as the titular boy, the orphaned son of a clockmaker who loved the films of Georges Melies. In his quest to repair the mysterious automaton that his late father left behind, Hugo befriends a young girl named Isabelle (Chloe Moretz) whose toymaker godfather (Ben Kingsley) may or may not be intimately connected to his father’s automaton. Lavishly shot in 3D, Hugo evokes a strong sense of cinematic nostalgia, demonstrating Martin Scorsese’s very personal love for the magic of the movies, and Certified Fresh at 93%, it’s a delightful treat for all families, whether they’re full of cinephiles or not. Now, it is available in Blu-ray 3D, but whether or not it will be able to duplicate the lush effects seen in theaters is still sort of up in the air; here’s hoping they re-release it for a post-Oscar run. For those curious about the extras, the Blu-ray 3D package comes with a handful of featurettes, including a making-of doc and short videos dedicated to the automaton, Georges Melies, one of the special effects shots, and Sacha Baron Cohen.Johnny English Reborn 38%Because the world was simply chomping at the bit to get more of bumbling secret agent Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) back in 2003, he made a return to the big screen eight years later and Johnny English Reborn was… born. Critics, however, found the sequel only slightly more bearable than the first film and another unfortunate waste of Atkinson’s comedic talents. Reborn finds our wacky hero off the grid and training deep in Asia when he is called upon once again by MI7, this time to help thwart an assassination attempt on the Chinese premier; double crosses and pratfalls ensue. If you’re familiar with Rowan Atkinson’s previous work, then you know what you’re getting here. Expect a lot of broad, slapsticky humor in service of well-worn spy spoof clichés, and if that’s your thing, then have at it. But at 37% on the Tomatometer, there’s no guarantee this will appeal to anyone outside of its target PG demographic.I Melt With You 16%Early Bret Easton Ellis novels (please, forgive us this comparison) and their subsequent film adaptations (like Less Than Zero and The Rules of Attraction) were famous for portrayals of disaffected youth doing naughty things and contemplating life. Now, imagine a handful of characters in their forties doing the same thing, and you’ve got I Melt With You. Rob Lowe, Jeremy Piven, Thomas Jane, and Christian McKay are old college buddies who meet up annually at Big Sur to celebrate a birthday, but with their own families and hidden secrets plaguing them, they embark on a week of drugs and parties until a tragedy forces them to face their past. Most critics would tell you to steer clear of I Melt With You, which earned a mere 13% on the Tomatometer; they generally agree that the film’s laughable script and ludicrous plot points do nothing to help the actors trying so desperately to make something of the material. For better or for worse, it’s available this week.Miss Bala 87%Mexico’s entry for this year’s Best Foreign Language Film Oscar (though it didn’t make the cut), Miss Bala is another one of those movies you probably haven’t heard of, much less seen, unless you keep close watch on our weekly Critics Consensus and live in a major city. Loosely based on true events, the film follows a young Mexican beauty queen who becomes wrapped up with a gang of drug-runners as she competes for her crown. Though it received just a little buzz and opened for a short time in limited release, critics found a lot to praise about the movie; it’s a loaded film whose subject matter is already heavy, but is made even more powerful by some interesting directorial choices and an assured filmmaking style. Certified Fresh at 89%, Miss Bala is an unflinching, timely look at a side of Mexican culture much talked about but rarely explored in this fashion.Vanya on 42nd Street – Criterion Collection 89%Vanya on 42nd Street‘s highbrow credentials are impeccable: it’s a modern take on Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya, adapted by David Mamet, directed by French maestro Louis Malle, and featuring Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn (the later three were responsible for the minimalist classic My Dinner with Andre). If that sounds like a snooze to you, it’s your loss; Vanya is a deliciously unconventional filmed play featuring some of New York’s finest stage talent (and Julianne Moore in a key early role). A new Criterion Blu-ray features a fresh digital transfer of the film, plus a making-of documentary that includes interviews with the actors.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Apple, what, Spike, 78th, MCU, adventure","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Oscar-winner-Hugo-Hits-Shelves"},{"id":"47613085614487","title":"Sam Taylor-Wood talks John Lennon and Nowhere Boy","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sam Taylor-Wood talks John Lennon and Nowhere BoyThe British director on the journey to her debut feature, a biopic of the teenage rock icon.by Luke Goodsell | October 8, 2010 |  CommentsEarly on in her career, British visual artist Sam Taylor-Wood and her then-partner recreated the famous portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, originally taken by Annie Leibovitz for Rolling Stone just hours before the Beatle was shot dead. “What was I thinking?” Taylor-Wood laughs. Now, of course, that art project has a whole other meaning for the director, who makes her feature film debut with this week’s Nowhere Boy, a depiction of the teenage life of the young John Lennon. Set in 1950s Liverpool, the movie presents a displaced Lennon (Aaron Johnson) torn between two key women — long-time guardian Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott-Thomas) and free-spirited birth mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff) — and how that turmoil fed into the creation of the rock ‘n’ roller he would become.We caught up with Taylor-Wood and asked her about some of the pressures surrounding the project, casting her leading man, and what Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney thought of her handiwork.RT: At what point did you decide to take on this film?Sam Taylor-Wood: Well, I’d been looking for material. I’d been reading so much crap, basically, and this one was given to me by a fellow director, Joe Wright, who directed Atonement, and he said to me: “I’m looking for my film and I’ve read this but it’s definitely your film, not mine.” That was such a blessing from him. I read it and just thought it’s the most powerful script I’d read, and felt completely and utterly compelled to make it. And then I had to fight for it because there was another director on it. So there was a little bit of drama before I got there.Why did Joe think it was your film?I don’t know, I think it was mainly because he knew a little bit of my background. I’d made a short film about two teenagers losing their virginity to Buzzcocks records, so I guess this was a coming-of-age story centered around music. So there might have been a similarity there.The script was written by Matt Greenhalgh, who also wrote [Joy Division film] Control, and there’s a similarity between those two in that they’re both about the influence that two different women had on a musical icon. Was that something that also appealed to you?Oh definitely. I had seen Control. It was definitely something that interested me because it was a great thing to think, “Behind every great man,” you know. [laughs] This was two very interesting women. I think the contrast between the two women was also very interesting to me — one being very stoic, post-War, and the other a seemingly free-spirited, pre-’60s kind of woman, very vivacious and larger than life; especially with Lennon looking for his mother and then finding this completely exotic woman who was different to the one that had brought him up. All of that was really fascinating to me.The film is very much about the influence of the “two mothers,” so to speak. Was there ever a point where you were thinking of pushing it more toward the music?I was trying to strike a balance between the emotional content and the coming-of-age story with the birth of a musician and rock ‘n’ roll and Lennon as we know him, and trying to give the music fair play and also the influence of rock ‘n’ roll on his life. So all of that was kind of in the melting pot together to try and create this.This is the rather obvious question, but was it a daunting subject, John Lennon?Yeah, it was. Well — you know what — it wasn’t daunting when I read it. I just thought, “Wow, this is such an incredible script; this is the film I wanna make.” And then because I had to fight for it I kind of lost sight of the fact that it was about Lennon; I was more just trying to get my hands on this project, and when I did I was caught up in the whirlwind of excitement that I had the film. It wasn’t until I went to Liverpool and put my feet on the earth that I suddenly felt the weight of the icon on my shoulders, you know: going to The Beatles museum, and every second thing is Beatlemania, and every person I met had their opinions here and there. So that was when I started to really feel the weight. And then second to that was when I then wrote to Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney for whatever memories they wanted to share, or their blessing, or whatever; that was when it started to dawn on me.Speaking of the weight of expectations. So, Yoko approved the use of songs for the film — what was her initial take on it?I don’t think she read the script; she might have, but she told me to remember one important thing: Aunt Mimi had been very demonized in a lot of biographies, and she said, “You have to be fair to Aunt Mimi because she really loved John; and John really loved her.” And that was all she needed to say, really, for me to have a better understanding. Here was a woman who, yes, was formidable and stern, but who was also the woman that nurtured and loved and cared for him. The other detail that Yoko gave me was that Aunt Mimi had taught John about poetry and painting, about Van Gogh and Oscar Wilde and all those things, so it sort of gave me a much more rounded picture of her than I’d had before.Along with Yoko’s approval to use songs, you had obtain permission from Paul McCartney. What were his thoughts?Well, he was reluctant at first, because I felt that he was nervous as to how he was going to be portrayed in the film, or about another film on The Beatles — which it wasn’t. At first he was very forthcoming with details, and said, “Lennon was like this… ” and offered some funny stories, and then he gave me details of equipment, and really valuable things. And then both he and Yoko I felt got nervous and sort of stepped away and let me get on with it. Then at the end, he saw it, and we’d shot three scenes without music rights — rather frighteningly, the whole film had to be done and dusted without music rights for them to approve. It was a nerve-wracking experience, because we either did or didn’t have a film depending on what McCartney and Yoko would say. Thankfully he liked it enough to give us the rights, so that was enough of a validation.Aaron said that Paul couldn’t remember being punched in the face by John, as happens in the film. Was that a little embellishment?Yeah, it was. In the scene following that scene, it was important for us that we have a scene in which Lennon and McCartney come together in a sort of recognition that they’d both lost their mothers. And to get to that moment, without it being sappy and wet, Matt had written this whole angry, violent outburst by Lennon; so it came from that. It kind of needed a crescendo to reach that moment. Someone hits someone, and of course, our film is about Lennon, so… [laughs]The way the shot pulls out on them embracing is great.Yeah, that’s one of my favorite shots that one, because it’s such a moment of two men just having that moment of loss and acknowledging that.You’ve said that you knew Aaron was Lennon when he walked in the door. What was it about him, especially as he was in the middle of filming Kick-Ass at the time?He’s a perfectionist, as I’ve since come to know. When we were auditioning I knew he was shooting Kick-Ass so I didn’t have high expectations, because I thought he’d be in the world of, you know, Superbad and that kind of genre, and be that kind of geeky kid. So when I opened the door to him and he was already talking and being Lennon-like, I was already impressed. I thought for him to pull that off in such a short space of time was kind of incredible. He just had an intensity and a slight sort of madness to him, because he was sitting there talking to himself, as Lennon, and having conversations with himself. He didn’t want to speak to me as Aaron, so I just had to listen to him be Lennon. It showed me that he had the intensity to take on the role — and also the courage to take on the icon.The film opens with the chord from “A Hard Day’s Night” — was that a sort of wink that, “This is a music film, but it’s not really about the music?”Well, yeah — there was a slight “Eureka!” moment when I was editing. I knew that opening scene needed something else and I thought, “People are coming to this film, or a lot of people, because they’re Lennon or Beatles fans,” and it was almost like an acknowledgment of who this film was about and who he goes on to become. So in a way, that whole opening scene, I wanted it to be like a vision of the future, if you like — so he’s sort of running, with the girls screaming and the noise in his head. Slightly dream-like. I just wanted to get the heartbeat thumping of all the fans. [laughs]Nowhere Boy is out now.Click here to read our chat with Nowhere Boy star Aaron Johnson, and find out his Five favorite Films.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Teen, Thanksgiving, Company, FOX, television, Land, Tubi, The, Syfy, GIFs, name, Sundance, fiction","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"sam-taylorwood-talks-john-lennon-and-nowhere-boy"},{"id":"47613068068239","title":"5 Family-Friendly Holiday Movies You Might Have Missed","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})5 Family-Friendly Holiday Movies You Might Have Missedby Alonso Duralde | December 16, 2015 |  CommentsWhile the holidays are certainly all about tradition – wearing the same sweaters, baking the same cookies, playing the same Andy Williams CD, washing your hands with the same fir-scented liquid soap – sometimes it makes Christmas better to throw a little something new into the rotation. As you spend time with the kids this month, or even just park them in front of a TV so you can get some decorating done, check out these family-friendly movies that might be new to you and/or the young’uns. (And for more seasonal film options, check out my book Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas.)Arthur Christmas (2011)  92%Released at the same time as the bigger-budgeted Hugo and Tintin, and saddled with both a terrible marketing campaign and a titular pun that doesn’t really work outside the UK, this import from Aardman fell between the cracks in its original Stateside release, although its cult among Yanks grows every December. Arthur (voiced by James McAvoy) is the son of the current Santa Claus (Jim Broadbent). Santa’s older son Steve (Hugh Laurie) has turned the gift-distribution functions of the North Pole into a ruthlessly well-oiled machine, but it’s Arthur who keeps the spirit of Christmas alive, especially when one final present needs to be delivered before the sun rises on December 25.Lassie (2006)  93%This is not the “What’s that? Timmy’s trapped in Dead Rock Canyon?” Lassie that you’ve gotten to know from the American TV series; this sweeping (and tear-jerking) British movie faithfully adapts the original novel by Eric Knight. Director Charles Sturridge (the Brideshead Revisited&nbsp;miniseries) assembles a powerhouse cast that places talented newcomers alongside vets like Peter O’Toole, Peter Dinklage and Samantha Morton. The brave collie makes her way across Scotland and England to be reunited with her impoverished young master – but will she come home in time for Christmas?Millions (2005)  88%With a filmography that ranges from Steve Jobs to Trainspotting&nbsp;to Slumdog Millionaire, director Danny Boyle generally defies categorization, although you might not necessarily apply “kid-friendly” to his work – unless you’ve seen this delightful 2004 comedy. Young Damian (Alex Etel) is reeling from the recent death of his mother when a satchel of money falls down from heaven (actually, a passing train). With the clock ticking toward the New Year, when the UK will convert from pounds to Euros – this is a fantasy, after all – Damian has to figure out what to do with the money while staying a step ahead of the gangsters who want it back.Prancer (1989)  67%The British don’t have a monopoly on the genre; this made-in-the-USA tale introduces us to Christmas-obsessed Jessica (Rebecca Harrell), who’s convinced that the ailing reindeer she’s nursing back to health is actually Prancer, who has somehow gotten separated from his brethren at the North Pole. With an ensemble that includes Sam Elliott, Cloris Leachman and Abe Vigoda, this disarming movie captures the magic and the power of childhood belief without ever overstating its case or getting too precious about it. And even adults might want to keep a hanky on hand.Unaccompanied Minors (2006)  29%After Freaks and Geeks and before Bridesmaids, director Paul Feig crafted this energetic and clever farce about a group of kids stuck at a snowed-in airport on Christmas Eve. While it’s been unfairly lumped in with other post–Home Alone comedies about kids outsmarting adults, this one’s actually based on a story from All Things Considered, and Feig once again casts some amazing young actors (including Tyler James Williams of Everybody Hates Chris and Dear White People) alongside an army of comic greats, including Mindy Kaling, Jessica Walter, Lewis Black, Teri Garr, Rob Corddry and three of the Kids in the Hall, to name just a few.Alonso Duralde is the author of the quintessential holiday film guide Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas.
