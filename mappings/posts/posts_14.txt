Leading the chart for the second weekend in a row was the animated hit The LEGO Movie with an estimated $48.8M over the Friday-to-Sunday span dropping a low 29% from its record opening.After just ten days, the PG-rated hit has grossed a sensational $129.1M making it the top-grossing film of 2014. Warner Bros. looks on course to finish its domestic run in the neighborhood of $250M which would be a remarkable accomplishment for a toon outside of the key play periods of summer and holiday.Word-of-mouth was strong, reviews have been awesome, and no new movies opened for families so LEGO easily dominated the marketplace for a second time. After the Presidents Day holiday on Monday, the 11-day sum could soar to about $140M. Mid-week business is expected to be solid too as many schools nationwide will be closed for winter break.Red hot comic Kevin Hart delivered his second hit comedy in as many months with the date flick About Last Night which debuted to muscular numbers with an estimated $27M from 2,253 locations for a fantastic $11,984 average. The Sony release was the only R-rated pic among the weekend’s four new titles and also grossed the most money. Reviews for the remake of the 1986 Rob Lowe-Demi Moore film were quite strong.Mature women drove the success as studio research showed that the audience was 63% female and 57% over 30. With the opening day also being Valentine’s Day, Friday registered a massive $13M in ticket sales which slightly edged out LEGO that day. Hart’s brand of humor has been extremely popular and his lead roles in About Last Night and last month’s Ride Along will lead to over $200M in combined domestic grosses. 2014 is a breakout box office year for him, much like 1994 was for Jim Carrey.Another 80s remake from Sony, the futuristic action thriller RoboCop, stumbled into third place with less firepower than the studio was hoping for. The PG-13 pic debuted to an estimated $21.5M from 3,372 locations including IMAX venues averaging $6,376 per site. With its soft mid-week launch on Wednesday, the five-day cume was only $26.4M. Including the Presidents Day holiday on Monday, the six-day debut period should end up at about $30M. The studio was publicly expecting it to reach the $35-40M range.The performance was below the levels of other 1980s action properties recently recycled for today’s audiences. Exactly one year ago, the sequel A Good Day to Die Hard bowed to $36.9M over five days during the same holiday weekend and 2012’s Total Recall debuted to $25.6M over a regular summer frame.Young male action fans used to be the bread and butter of Hollywood. But today, they are much harder to attract to multiplexes except with huge sequels or superhero films. In fact, very few male-skewing action movies have overperformed at the domestic box office over the past year with an alarmingly high number flopping. The upside is that these films, like RoboCop, often perform well overseas and later on video platforms.Budgeted at about $100M, RoboCop earned lackluster reviews from critics and played to an older male crowd. Studio research showed that 62% of the crowd was male and 64% was over 25. Overseas, the metal man took in $35M from 76 markets this weekend boosting the international total to $69.9M with the worldwide box office breaking $100M on Monday.Sony also owned fourth place with The Monuments Men which dropped a reasonable 32% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $15M. The George Clooney period drama has banked $43.7M to date and could be headed for the vicinity of $80M.Teen girls and young women powered the new romance Endless Love putting it into fifth place with an estimated $13.4M. The Universal release averaged a decent $4,627 from 2,896 sites and was driven by Valentine’s Day business on Friday which accounted for a whopping 55% of the weekend gross. The PG-13 film played to one quadrant as studio data showed the audience to be 80% female and 76% under 25. The CinemaScore was a good A-.Kevin Hart made his second appearance in the top ten with his other smash hit Ride Along. The comedy displayed tremendous strength in its fifth weekend easing a scant 8% to an estimated $8.8M boosting the total to date to a stellar $116.1M. Many Hart fans sold out of About Last Night had the option of checking out this one. Universal could be on its way to $140M or more making Ride Along a bigger hit than Will Ferrell’s recent heavily hyped comedy sequel Anchorman 2.Striking out with audiences over Valentine’s Day weekend was the critically-panned romance Winter’s Tale starring Colin Farrell, Russell Crowe, and Jennifer Connelly which settled for a seventh place opening. The Warner Bros. pic grossed an estimated $7.8M from 2,965 theaters for a weak $2,626 average. Reviews were terrible and the B CinemaScore indicated that ticket buyers were only modestly satisfied.Frozen, the highest-grossing original toon of all-time, dipped 15% to an estimated $5.9M and ended an amazing streak of 11 consecutive weekends in the top five. The Disney smash upped its total to $376M putting it at number 23 on the all-time domestic blockbusters list right behind the $377M of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The worldwide tally soared to $955.7M and is less than two weeks away from breaking the coveted billion dollar barrier.Universal’s Lone Survivor followed with an estimated $4.1M, down 26%, for a new total of $118.4M. Rounding out the top ten was the comedy That Awkward Moment which fell 36% to an estimated $3.3M for a sum to date of $21.4M for Focus.The top ten films grossed an estimated $155.6M which was up 28% from last year when A Good Day to Die Hard opened at number one with $24.8M over three days; and up 13% from 2012 when Safe House took the top spot in its second round with $23.6M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Hulu, Calendar, Poppins","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-LEGO-and-Kevin-Hart-Lead-Solid-Holiday"},{"id":"47509116194530","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Frozen is Back On Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Frozen is Back On TopParanormal Activity: The Marked Ones and The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | January 5, 2014 |  CommentsAs many parts of the country were freezing over, the box office was busy being conquered by Frozen as the Disney megahit reclaimed the number one spot in its sixth frame of wide play and came within striking distance of the triple century mark. Only one new film opened with Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones scaring up a respectable second place showing. With little incoming competition, holiday holdovers for the most part held up well although grosses did get affected for all films by the winter storms especially in the northeast and midwest. But despite weather issues, overall spending was actually even with the first weekend of January from both last year and 2012.Moviegoers kept flocking to multiplexes to see the singing sisters of Arendelle as Frozen slipped only 28% to an estimated $20.7M which was good enough for first place. It was its fifth weekend with sales above $20M. The animated smash has grossed an eye-popping $297.8M to date and may smash through the $300M barrier on Tuesday with much more cash to come.With competing studios doing an awful job of programming other compelling animated offerings this winter, the road ahead is still mostly wide open for Frozen to take advantage of. January 17 sees the debut of the month’s only new toon The Nut Job which may not be a huge rival making all of January a great play period for Disney to see its cume rise. Word of mouth and repeat business have been solid. Reaching the $360M domestic mark seems likely and surpassing the $367.9M of Despicable Me 2 is still possible which would make Frozen the toon champ from 2013. The fact that it is not a sequel speaks even more to the incredible performance.Overseas movie fans have been going gaga too for Anna and Elsa with the global tally crushing the $600M mark this weekend. The frame saw an estimated $52.5M from international markets boosting that cume to $342.1M and the worldwide haul to a sensational $639.9M. Look for the $700M barrier to come crashing down next weekend with Frozen on a trajectory to reach $900M and beyond with openings in Japan and China still to come.Opening in second place was the horror franchise flick Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones with an estimated $18.2M from 2,867 locations for a decent $6,348 average. It was a sharp drop from the opening of the last film in the franchise – 2012’s Paranormal Activity 4 – which bowed to $29M. However, the new chapter presented a new cast and was released in January instead of the fright-friendly month of October.Compared to other R-rated horror films opening in early January, Marked Ones debuted on the low end of the usual range. High teens and low 20s are common for this time of year for this type of film. This new saga took a bold turn by presenting a mostly Latino American cast with its Southern California setting. Given the expected erosion that a scary movie franchise would see in its fifth film, the non-Halloween release date, and some sales being lost to the winter storms, the opening weekend of Marked Ones was commendable.The CinemaScore grade was a C- which is lousy even by horror movie standards. Paranormal Activity 4 scored a C and the prior pic earned a C+. The gender split was even and 68% were under 25. With a low $5M production cost, and a marketing spend that was probably more than that, Marked Ones should still end up being another profitable chapter in the series. Its overseas opening this weekend brought in $16.2M from 13 markets for a $34.4M worldwide launch with Russia, Brazil, and many other Latin American territories to open next week. Paramount may need to juice up excitement to keep the franchise relevant this October when Paranormal Activity 5 is unleashed.Following its three-week reign atop the box office charts, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug fell to the bronze medal position with an estimated $16.3M. Its 44% decline represented the worst drop in the top ten while the domestic total rose to $229.6M. Released by Warner Bros., Smaug did rank number one on the international chart with an estimated $58M this weekend from 62 overseas markets. That drove the cume to $527M and the worldwide haul to $756.6M with Japan and China still to open in late February. Compared to last winter’s An Unexpected Journey, the new Hobbit saga is running 13% behind domestically and 8% behind globally. Getting to $1 billion is still a possibility, though.A pair of star-driven Oscar hopefuls followed with nearly identical grosses. Based on estimates, Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street inched ahead with an estimated $13.4M, off only 27% from its first weekend. Paramount’s 12-day total is $63.3M and the legendary filmmaker is well on his way to scoring another Leo-driven $100M hit. Sony’s American Hustle grossed an estimated $13.2M, off 30%, for a total of $88.7M on its way to the century club as well.Will Ferrell scored the seventh $100M hit of his career with Anchorman 2 which dropped 44% to an estimated $11.1M lifting the cume to $109.2M for Paramount. Disney followed with Saving Mr. Banks which slipped 33% to an estimated $9.1M while Fox’s The Secret Life of Walter Mitty followed with an estimated $8.2M, off 36%. Cumes stand at $59.3M and $45.7M, respectively.In its seventh weekend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire still ranked in the top ten pulling in an estimated $7.4M, off 27%, propelling the domestic cume to a staggering $407.5M. The Katniss series is now the first movie franchise in history to score $400M+ grosses on each of its first two installments. On Monday, Catching Fire should surpass the $408M of the first Hunger Games and by mid-week it will exceed the $409M of Iron Man 3 to become 2013’s highest-grossing North American film. Fire currently sits at number 15 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters and its worldwide tally has risen to $830.9M.Rounding out the top ten was a movie that did not make the list last weekend when it opened — Grudge Match. The Stallone-De Niro comedy eased only 23% to an estimated $5.4M and put its 12-day gross at a lackluster $24.9M for Warner Bros.Three less popular films opening on Christmas Day saw big tumbles on their second weekends. Universal’s big-budget bomb 47 Ronin fell 50% to an estimated $5M for a weak $32.6M to date for Keanu Reeves. Mandela dropped 51% to an estimated $1.1M giving The Weinstein Co. only $7.1M to date. Justin Bieber fans lost faith in Believe which grossed an estimated $573,000, down a disastrous 72%, for a puny $6M total to date for Open Road.Awards hopefuls kept chugging along as they awaited the Oscar nominations on January 16 which could give some a major commercial boost with broader audiences. Inside Llewyn Davis took in an estimated $1.2M, off only 6%, for a $7,532 average and $7M cume for CBS Films. Warner Bros. held in 47 sites for Joaquin Phoenix’s Her with an estimated $1.1M, up 11%. The average was a solid $15,362 with the sum at $3M. It expands nationwide next weekend.Paramount’s Nebraska slipped 9% to an estimated $670,000 with a mild $2,792 average and $7.1M total. The older-skewing story is just what Academy members often like so a Best Picture nomination could result. The Meryl Streep-Julia Roberts pic August: Osage County showed some weakness dropping 21% to an estimated $141,000 from five theaters in its second weekend. The average from platform release was a sturdy $28,177, cume is at $483,000 for Weinstein.The top ten films grossed an estimated $122.9M which was up 6% from last year when Texas Chainsaw 3D opened at number one with $21.7M; and up 2% from 2012 when The Devil Inside debuted in the top spot with $33.7M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Musical, watch, south, song","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Frozen-is-Back-On-Top"},{"id":"47509114445528","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman Takes the Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman Takes the Top Spot300: Rise of an Empire and Need For Speed round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | March 16, 2014 |  CommentsThe top ten was littered with new faces as smaller films performed better than larger ones. The street racing actioner Need For Speed and Tyler Perry’s comedy The Single Moms Club both underperformed while indie pics The Grand Budapest Hotel and Veronica Mars jumped onto the list with the best averages. Overall, the domestic marketplace performed at normal levels for mid-March but it was a cartoon holdover that seized control of the number one spot.DreamWorks Animation captured the box office crown with its latest film Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman which declined by only 34% to an estimated $21.2M in its second weekend to lead all films. The Fox release has collected $63.2M in ten days and could find its way to $135M or more in North America which would improve upon recent DreamWorks titles Turbo and Rise of the Guardians.Peabody enjoyed a better second weekend hold than most previous animated films opening in March including The Croods, The Lorax, Horton Hears a Who, Monsters vs. Aliens, and the first two Ice Age flicks. The drop was equal to How To Train Your Dragon‘s from 2010 which was a durable hit that went on to gross five times its opening weekend take. The road ahead will not be easy for Sherman. Disney attacks this Friday with its heavily-hyped kidpic sequel Muppets Most Wanted followed three weeks later by Fox’s Rio 2.Falling from the box office throne was 300: Rise of an Empire which dropped by a reasonable 58% to an estimated $19.1M for second place. For a male-skewing action sequel, the decline was not too bad. The original 300, a pop culture phenomenon, fell by 54% in its sophomore frame this same month in 2007. Warner Bros. has taken in $78.3M in ten days and could be headed for a domestic final of $110-120M. Overseas, Empire grossed an estimated $41.3M from 62 markets this weekend boosting the international cume to $158M and the worldwide take to $236.3M.Selling over 140 million video games apparently means little at the multiplexes. The game-inspired action thriller Need For Speed disappointed in its debut weekend grossing only $17.8M, according to estimates, for a $5,717 average from 3,115 locations. Produced by DreamWorks Pictures and released by Disney, the PG-13 film played heavily to young men as expected. Studio research showed that guys made up 70% of the crowd while 56% were in the 18-34 age bracket. 3D accounted for 43% of the gross which was not bad by today’s standards on a film like this which is more driven by stunts than special effects.Need For Speed opened with less than half of the strength of the original Fast &amp; Furious film which relied on 2001 ticket prices and no 3D. That surprise street racing hit debuted to $40.1M and an average of more than $15,000 which would be north of $20,000 at today’s 2D prices. The CinemaScore on Need was a moderate B+.Speed was banking on fans of the game to come out and buy tickets. But young males have become incredibly difficult to lure into multiplexes in recent years, especially outside of tentpole sequels and VFX-driven super hero flicks. Plus, Speed had no major names in the cast and awful reviews from critics. Outside of Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-winning Lincoln, it’s been tough times for DreamWorks Pictures with a string of duds like Delivery Man, The Fifth Estate, People Like Us, and A Thousand Words before Need For Speed came out.International markets presented a brighter picture for Need For Speed. China opened strong this weekend with $21.2M (including $2.4M from 138 IMAX screens) beating out the domestic debut. $45.6M was grossed overseas this weekend making for a global start of $63.4M with key markets like Germany, France, Spain, Korea and Japan still to come. Produced for $66M and requiring a loud marketing push including a pricey Super Bowl commercial, Speed will need success from foreign markets to break even.Liam Neeson enjoyed another good weekend for his action thriller Non-Stop which grossed an estimated $10.6M falling only 33% in its third round. The Universal hit has collected $68.8M thus far.Tyler Perry’s star continued to fade this weekend as the media mogul suffered the worst opening of his directing career with The Single Moms Club which bowed to an estimated $8.3M. That was less than half of the usual $20M or so that he routinely delivers on the first weekend of most films. The PG-13 pic averaged a mild $4,378 from 1,896 locations – again, low by Perry standards.Club did earn a good A- CinemaScore grade and the audience skewed heavily towards adult women. Studio research showed that 79% was female and 80% was over 25. After releasing all his other work, Lionsgate recently decided not to renew its deal with Perry. His last film A Madea Christmas opened to $16M which was by far a new low for that character’s films, however somewhat understandable for a pic opening during the holiday shopping season when debuts are generally lower. It did go on to break $50M like all past Madea flicks. Meet the Peeples, presented by Perry but not written or directed by him, was a clunker last summer with a $4.6M debut.Toon hit The LEGO Movie followed with an estimated $7.7M, off 29%, for a robust $236.9M cume for Warner Bros. Worldwide tally is now $378.4M. Fox’s Biblical film Son of God fell 48% to an estimated $5.4M and has banked $50.9M to date.Wes Anderson’s newest offering The Grand Budapest Hotel pulled off a perfect expansion jumping from four to 66 locations and grossing an estimated $3.6M for an eye-popping $55,152 average. Ranking eighth nationwide despite a limited release, Fox Searchlight’s indie smash became the first film playing in under 100 theaters to hit the national top ten since the director’s own Moonrise Kingdom from June 2012. With $4.8M to date, Hotel will expand into 40 new markets next weekend with roughly 300 total theaters. The film has posted numbers even bigger than Anderson’s past hits suggesting his newest has appeal beyond his loyal fan base.The music-filled juggernaut that is Frozen ranked ninth with an estimated $2.1M, down only 28%, for a $396.4M domestic haul on its way past the $400M mark, possibly by month’s end. Disney’s Oscar-winning smash has now spent its first 16 weeks of wide release in the top ten matching Chicago for the most among all films released since 1997’s Titanic which spent 15 straight weeks at number one. Overseas, Frozen opened in its final market of Japan with a rare Friday release resulting in a big $9.4M debut weekend ahead of what should be a long run. The overseas tally soared to $630.2M for a global haul of $1.027 billion charging towards a $1.1 billion final. It releases domestically on Blu-ray this week while simultaneously being in the top ten theatrically.Snow sister Anna also found herself in tenth place as Kristen Bell’s Veronica Mars debuted to an estimated $2M from 291 theaters for a good $6,945 average. Backed by fans of the television series through a Kickstarter campaign, the indie film was extremely front-loaded as half of the sales came on opening day with Saturday plunging 39%. Fans who donated also got a digital copy to download, although many had technical problems with that platform. Warner Bros. handled distribution and reviews were fairly positive. Tied for tenth place was George Clooney’s The Monuments Men, also with an estimated $2M weekend, putting Sony at $73.8M to date.A year after conquering the box office with Identity Thief, Jason Bateman unleashed his directorial debut Bad Words in platform release and attracted commendable numbers from New York and Los Angeles. The raunchy spelling bee comedy bowed to an estimated $120,000 from six locations for a strong $20,000 average. Reviews were mixed for the R-rated pic which Focus expands Friday into the Top 20 markets before going nationwide the following week. Expanding at the same time as Budapest Hotel will be challenging, though, given the audience overlap.The top ten films grossed an estimated $97.9M which was up 6% from last year when Oz the Great and Powerful stayed at number one with $41.3M; and up 5% from 2012 when 21 Jump Street took the top spot with $36.3M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Chernobyl, San, TV, Marvel, police, Black, 2017, Premium, Nominations, TNT, golden, disaster, 2020, of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Mr-Peabody-and-Sherman-Takes-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509114449625","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: 300 Reigns Supreme at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: 300 Reigns Supreme at #1by Gitesh Pandya | March 10, 2014 |  CommentsExactly seven years after the record-breaking opening of the blockbuster Spartan battle pic, the historical action sequel 300: Rise of an Empire conquered the global box office with international growth helping to make up for understandable domestic shrinkage. The brutal R-rated war epic debuted to an estimated $45.1M in North America capturing the top spot with ease driven by a carnage-loving male fan base. Warner Bros. averaged a strong $12,983 from 3,470 locations including 343 IMAX screens (up from only 62 on the first film) which did tremendously well.Rise opened 36% weaker than the $70.9M debut of 300 from 2007, however it was never expected to come close to that runaway smash. The first film offered a different graphic novel style to the worn out genre of historical epics and became a ground-breaking smash with one of the best trailers from the past decade. Rise featured a mostly new cast and a new director while 3D was added to the fun. With much of the film and backgrounds being computer-generated, that format lent itself well to the audience as the 3D share of the gross was 63% – very high by today’s standards.Reviews were lackluster for the $110M-budgeted production, but moviegoers came out for the action, intense war violence, and special effects. In fact, it opened better than several recent VFX-driven action movies – some with A-list stars – including Elysium, Oblivion, Riddick, The Lone Ranger, Pacific Rim, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation as well as Wrath of the Titans which was another Warner Bros. period action sequel opening in March. Breaking $40M on opening weekend for action movies has become difficult these days except for super hero flicks or top literary brand like The Hunger Games and The Hobbit.Long-term playability looks tough for Rise of an Empire. Its lukewarm B grade from CinemaScore shows that customer satisfaction is not too high, plus sequels like these are usually very front-loaded. IMAX screens contributed a robust $6.8M of the weekend gross accounting for a high 15% of the tally with an average of nearly $20,000. Males made up 62% of the crowd.Overseas, the new 300 launched in 58 markets and captured an estimated $87.8M which was 10% better than comparable results for the Gerard Butler flick. Global opening was a towering $132.9M since Wednesday. Factor out higher ticket prices today and 3D surcharges and the attendance was still extremely close to the first film’s making for a remarkable performance for this follow-up. The brand is still strong and with international markets growing significantly in recent years, especially for 3D and IMAX formats, Rise could be on its way past the $400M global box office mark just like its predecessor.The DreamWorks Animation offering Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman enjoyed a respectable debut in second place with an estimated $32.5M from 3,934 locations for a solid $8,261 average. The PG-rated comedy based on the 1960s cartoon characters opened in the same range as other 3D toons like Epic ($33.5M) and both Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs movies ($30.3M, $34M) and edged out the five-day $31M debut last summer of the studio’s last film Turbo.Reviews were very positive for the Fox release and audiences liked the film too as evidenced by its A CinemaScore grade. Studio research showed that females made up 56% of the audience and 52% were over 25. The genius dog and his boy should have smooth sailing for the next week with no kidpics opening next weekend, but will face competition on March 21 when Disney rolls out the heavily-marketed The Muppets Most Wanted. But Peabody does seem to be on track to join 300 in becoming the latest $100M+ domestic grossers for 2014 with plenty of international potential as well.Liam Neeson enjoyed a moderate hold for his latest action hit Non-Stop. The airline thriller fell 47% in its second weekend to an estimated $15.4M for a ten-day cume of $52.1M. Look for the Universal release to end up with around $90M. Toon juggernaut The LEGO Movie took a big hit from the new DreamWorks competition and dropped 47% in its fifth round, the largest decline of its month-long run. The Warner Bros. smash grossed an estimated $11M and boosted its total to a hefty $225M.The Jesus pic Son of God tumbled 61% in its sophomore weekend to an estimated $10M suffering the worst drop of any film in the top ten. Fox has banked $41.5M in ten days and is headed for a $60M final. The George Clooney hit The Monuments Men grossed an estimated $3.1M, off 37%, for a $70.6M total.The Kevin Costner actioner 3 Days to Kill followed with an estimated $3.1M, down 38%, putting Relativity at $25.6M. Double Oscar winner Frozen eased only 17% to an estimated $3M boosting the phenomenal domestic cume to $393.1M. The Best Animated Feature champ has now spent 15 consecutive weekends in the top ten which is even more than Avatar. The global tally rose to $1.009 billion with Japan set to open this Friday as its final major market.The winner of the top trophy at the Academy Awards, 12 Years a Slave, more than doubled its screens and jumped back into the top ten for the first time since November with an estimated $2.2M more than doubling last weekend’s take. Fox Searchlight has taken in an impressive $53.1M for the indie film. Rounding out the top ten were two action titles with an estimated $2M each. The Kevin Hart-Ice Cube comedy hit Ride Along was down 34% with a robust $130M cume for Universal while Sony’s RoboCop fell 56% for $54.7M to date from North America but a potent $220M globally.Wes Anderson’s latest film The Grand Budapest Hotel rocked the specialty box office soaring even higher than his usual muscular standards with a platform bow of an estimated $800,000 from four theaters in New York and Los Angeles for an eye-popping $200,000 average. Most locations were triple-screening the well-reviewed comedy helping it score the best average in box office history among regular film releases. Budapest’s average was significantly better than the $130,749 registered by the director’s last film Moonrise Kingdom from May 2012, also in four theaters, which itself was phenomenal. The director has long had a large and loyal fan base. Fox Searchlight will expand quickly on Friday into most major markets nationwide into about 75 total playdates.The top ten films grossed an estimated $127.3M which was up 2% from last year when Oz the Great and Powerful opened at number one with $79.1M; and up 10% from 2012 when The Lorax took the top spot with $38.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Trek, laika, independent, Spring","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-300-Reigns-Supreme-at-1"},{"id":"47509116187359","title":"Box Office Wrap-up: Ride Along Says Bye, Frankenstein","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrap-up: Ride Along Says Bye, FrankensteinHorror flop comes in well behind recent holdovers.by Gitesh Pandya | January 26, 2014 |  CommentsIt was a sluggish session at the North American box office as Hollywood offered just one new movie which was rejected by audiences allowing the top five to be filled by the same faces as last week. The action-horror thriller I, Frankenstein flopped while the hit buddy comedy Ride Along once again took first place for a second weekend in a row with a reasonably good hold. Moviegoers did spend some time sampling the Academy Award nominees for Best Picture as eight of the nine contenders found themselves in the Top 20.Kevin Hart and Ice Cube once again ruled the box office with their runaway hit Ride Along which collected an estimated $21.2M in its sophomore round easily beating all competitors. The Universal hit dropped 49% which was a decent hold considering it was coming off of a holiday weekend when Sunday numbers were stronger than usual. With a robust $75.4M grossed in the first ten days, look for the PG-13 film to end up with roughly $125M which would be a career high for each star in a lead role, and also five times bigger than its $25M production cost. Ride Along is also set to soar higher than many of last year’s big comedy titles like This is the End, Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa and The Hangover Part III and will reach the same vicinity as Anchorman 2.Mark Wahlberg and his fellow soldiers held their ground in second with Lone Survivor which fell back 43% to an estimated $12.6M in its third round of wide release. The Universal hit has grossed an impressive $93.6M and will cross the $100M mark before the Super Bowl. The studio is off to a fantastic start in 2014 topping the charts over the last three weeks with two films about to join the century club.Advertising itself as the #1 family movie in America, the animated comedy The Nut Job finished its second weekend in third place with an estimated $12.3M after a good hold that saw sales drop just 37%. The Open Road release has banked $40.3M in ten days and could be headed for a $75M final. A sequel has already been announced and will follow the same release pattern opening over the Martin Luther King holiday in 2016.Toon juggernaut, and double Oscar nominee, Frozen enjoyed great stamina again dipping only 23% to an estimated $9M in its ninth weekend of wide release boosting the remarkable domestic haul up to $347.8M. Next weekend, Disney will replace over 1,000 of the runs with a new sing-along version of the popular film in hopes of generating even more repeat business.Frozen now sits at number 27 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters just two spots behind last year’s sensation Despicable Me 2 which had the added advantage of being a sequel playing in summer when kids were out of school. The snow sisters will surpass the Minions in a couple of weeks to steal away the animated box office crown for 2013. Frozen also zoomed past the $800M global mark this weekend with a worldwide tally of $810.3M and counting. With China and Japan still to open, breaking the billion dollar mark is looking more and more likely.The CIA reboot Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit followed its weak opening weekend with a moderate 43% decline to an estimated $8.8M for a disappointing ten-day take of $30.2M. With a reported production cost of $60M, the Paramount release should end its domestic run with only $50M or so. Overseas sales, though, are at a respectable $46.5M early in its run with nearly half coming from China.Moviegoers showed no interest in paying to see the new monster movie I, Frankenstein which opened poorly in sixth place with an estimated $8.3M. Averaging a weak $3,006 from 2,753 locations, the PG-13 film starring Aaron Eckhart failed to generate much heat and the higher-priced 3D and IMAX options did not seem to be premium experiences that ticket buyers felt like spending cash for on this particular title. The opening was even worse than the $11.2M debut of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein from back in 1994 when tickets cost half as much as today.Films like I, Frankenstein used to be able to count on teen males to turn out. But that demo’s lower attendance today (especially for non-tentpoles) is once again hurting big-budget action films. This one reportedly cost $65M to produce. Lionsgate research showed that 60% of the audience was over 25 and 62% was male. The CinemaScore grade was a B which was decent for this genre of action-horror fare. But past films of this category have opened much better like Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters’ $19.7M from this same weekend last year and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter’s $16.3M.A handful of Oscar nominees caught business from the public led by American Hustle with an estimated $7.1M, off just 28%, for a strong $127M cume to date for Sony. The Weinstein Co. added 360 theaters to the run of August: Osage County and saw sales dip 32% to an estimated $5M. Sum to date is $26.5M.Paramount’s The Wolf of Wall Street followed dipping 29% to an estimated $5M as well raising the total to $98M. Later this week it will become the fourth consecutive $100M+ grosser for the dynamic duo of Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Dicaprio.Rounding out the top ten with an estimated $2.8M was the fright flop Devil’s Due which tumbled 67% in its second weekend. The Fox release has scared up a lousy $12.9M in ten days and should end off with only $17M.The seven remaining Oscar nominees for Best Picture not in the top ten were all still out in national release looking to cash in on the awards attention with some adding screens. Dallas Buyers Club expanded by 691 theaters more than doubling its run and saw a 117% spike to an estimated $2M this weekend and $20.4M to date for Focus. Fox Searchlight’s 12 Years a Slave, seen by many as the one to beat, widened by 470 locations and grossed an estimated $2M, up 31%. Total is now $43.5M.Adding 316 runs was Gravity which rose 8% to an estimated $2M for a new total of $261.2M. The Warner Bros. smash earned the prestigious DGA Award on Saturday for director Alfonso Cuaron. Paramount’s black-and-white film Nebraska more than doubled its run adding 560 extra screens and collected an estimated $1.4M – the biggest weekend gross yet of its 11-week run. Cume is $11.6M.The offbeat romance Her with Joaquin Phoenix and the voice of Scarlett Johansson lost 404 locations and fell 43% to an estimated $2.3M giving Warner Bros. $19.2M overall. Judi Dench’s Philomena held steady in 505 locations and took in an estimated $1M, off 18%, for a $25.8M total. After an expansion last weekend, Captain Phillips lost two-thirds of its screens and collected an estimated $328,000, down 37%, for a $106.3M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $92.1M which was up 13% from last year when Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters opened at number one with $19.7M; but up 1% from 2012 when The Grey debuted in the top spot with $19.7M as well.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Awards, TV, HBO, TV, 20th","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Ride-Along-Says-Bye-Frankenstein"},{"id":"47509117932274","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Insidious Soars to Chilling $41M Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Insidious Soars to Chilling $41M Debutby Gitesh Pandya | September 15, 2013 |  CommentsFall moviegoers were in the mood to be scared as the horror sequel Insidious Chapter 2 dominated the North American box office with a spectacular opening that ranked among the best of all-time for its genre. FilmDistrict’s follow-up to its 2011 sleeper hit thriller bowed to a stunning $41.1M, according to estimates, averaging a sensational $13,463 from 3,049 locations.It was the second largest opening ever during the month of September coming in a hair behind the $42.5M of last year’s animated comedy Hotel Transylvania. Chapter 2 also generated the second best horror opening of all-time during the August-to-November corridor which is the most popular time of year for that genre due in part to Halloween. The only bigger debut was the $52.6M of another supernatural thriller sequel – 2011’s Paranormal Activity 3. For scary movies, first weekend audiences don’t get much bigger than this and there was no 3D gimmick to jack up prices.Many factors contributed to the Insidious success. The first installment was a leggy hit that created a large fan base and the cast was back for the sequel. A PG-13 rating made it commercially-friendly to younger teens who often look for something compelling to see during this back-to-school month. A Friday the 13th release date made sitting in that multiplex extra creepy and director James Wan was red hot coming off of his last film The Conjuring which was a monster hit this summer opening to a similar $41.9M in July. It enjoyed terrific legs, strong word-of-mouth, and currently sits at $136M domestic and an amazing $271M worldwide.Bad reviews didn’t matter as Chapter 2 got the weekend started with a scorching $20.1M opening day on Friday including $1.5M from Thursday night late shows beginning at 10:00pm. Saturday tumbled by a third to $13.5M and Sunday is estimated to fall by 45% to $7.4M. Horror films that use Friday the 13th as their launch date can often make half of their weekend sales in that first day and the latest Insidious was no different. Friday accounted for 49% of its weekend gross.Produced for a mere $5M, Chapter 2 should shoot ahead of the $54M of its predecessor and become one of the most profitable wide releases of 2013. Studio research showed that the audience was 52% male and 62% under 25 as teens made up a major component. The CinemaScore grade was a B+ which would be decent for most films, but is actually pretty good for the horror genre. The Conjuring scored a notch better with an A- while the year’s second biggest fright film, the January supernatural hit Mama, received a B-. With Insidious Chapter 2 and last spring’s Olympus Has Fallen, FilmDistrict has had a solid year beating out its peers at the box office.The witness protection action-comedy The Family debuted in second place with respectable results grossing an estimated $14.5M from 3,091 theaters for a decent $4,691 average. Relativity’s R-rated film starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer earned lackluster reviews from critics which helped to dampen the overall potential with its target audience of mature adults. But it did deliver one of the best openings for De Niro in a lead role over the past decade. Luc Besson directed and executive producer Martin Scorsese’s name was used in advertising to make moviegoers take the film seriously. A lousy C CinemaScore grade indicates a fast fade ahead.Last week’s number one film Riddick suffered the kind of sophomore tumble expected of a sci-fi sequel with lukewarm word-of-mouth. The Universal release fell 63% to an estimated $7M pushing the ten-day total to $31.3M. It was a bit larger than the 61% crash that its predecessor, 2004’s The Chronicles of Riddick, experienced in its second weekend in June of that year. Produced for $38M, the new Riddick should finish its domestic run with a mediocre $45M.A pair of leggy hits from August reached milestones this weekend. If estimates hold, Forest Whitaker’s The Butler will cross the $100M mark on Sunday night. The Weinstein Co. release declined by 34% to an estimated $5.6M spending its fifth frame in the top five and is now the distributor’s fifth film to break the nine-digit domestic mark. The other four all went on to earn Oscar nominations for Best Picture – Inglourious Basterds, The King’s Speech, Django Unchained, and Silver Linings Playbook. Meanwhile, the Warner Bros. sleeper hit We’re the Millers became the first live-action film of 2013 to remain in 3,000+ theaters for six weeks. That marks exceptional staying power especially given how competitive the marketplace has been over the last month. The pot smuggling comedy slipped 30% to an estimated $5.4M for $131.6M to date and will soon become Jennifer Aniston’s highest-grossing film in a lead role.The Spanish-language hit Instructions Not Included dropped 48% to an estimated $4.3M in its third round boosting the cume for Lionsgate up to $26.6M. Disney’s animated flick Planes held up well again slipping only 26% to an estimated $3.1M for $83M to date.Sony released a new fan cut of the boy band concert doc One Direction: This Is Us and saw the title slip by 41% to an estimated $2.4M giving the teen girl magnets $26.9M to date. Studio stablemate Elysium followed with an estimated $2.1M, down 35%, and a total of $88.4M. Rounding out the top ten was the fantasy offering Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters which slipped 25% to an estimated $1.8M putting Fox at $62M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $87.1M which was up 34% from last year when Resident Evil: Retribution debuted at number one with $21.1M; and up 5% from 2011 when The Lion King 3D opened in the top spot with $30.2M.Follow the Gitesh on the Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"The, popular, transformers, Shondaland, Pet, Crackle","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Insidious-Soars-to-Chilling-41M-Debut"},{"id":"47509117927152","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 Wins the Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 Wins the WeekendPlus, Rush, Baggage Claim, Don Jon end up at 3, 4, and 5.by Gitesh Pandya | September 29, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, Sony hit the top spot in North America with its new animated sequel Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 which grossed more than the frame’s other three wide openers combined. The PG-rated 3D pic bowed to an estimated $35M from an ultrawide 4,001 theaters delivering a $8,748 average. Compared to the first Cloudy from this same month four years ago, the sequel’s opening weekend gross was 16% higher but its average fell 10%. The original, also in 3D, was released in nearly 900 fewer locations bowing to $30.3M on its way to $124.9M, or four times its opening weekend.Meatballs 2 had a solid debut for sure, but considering how well-liked the first film was and how empty the marketplace is right now for family movies, the opening was not stellar. A year ago this weekend, the same studio found itself with a $42.5M opening for the animated comedy Hotel Transylvania which did not have the benefit of a built-in audience. It did boast the voice talents of box office titan Adam Sandler, however the toon was not promoted as a Sandler vehicle per se.But the road ahead for Meatballs looks promising as the entire month of October lacks new kidpics. It’s a rare case for studios to just give up on a whole month like this. Also audiences did like the new $78M-budgeted food flick as the CinemaScore grade was an A- so reaching past the $100M domestic mark is certainly possible. Reviews were decent, but not outstanding.Falling 46% in its second weekend and landing in second place was last week’s top film Prisoners with an estimated $11.3M. The Warner Bros. release has grossed $39M in ten days and should end up with $65-70M, a solid amount for an adult drama opening in September.Ron Howard’s Formula One drama Rush expanded nationwide after a one-week platform run and raced into third place this weekend with an estimated $10.3M. It was a respectable showing as the Universal release averaged $4,490 from 2,297 theaters. With a non-American cast and subject matter, the R-rated film was a tough sell to U.S. crowds and a marketplace filled with other options for adults did not help any. Cume is now $10.6M.With solid buzz from the Toronto International Film Festival, stellar reviews, and an encouraging A- CinemaScore grade, Rush hopes to keep attracting business in the weeks ahead thanks to word-of-mouth. However, direct competition for adults will only get more fierce each week in October especially with Gravity starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney looking to deliver a powerful debut next weekend. Studio research showed that the 1970s-set Rush played 52% male and skewed old — 53% were 40 or above.The comedy Baggage Claim premiered in fourth place to decent results collecting an estimated $9.3M from 2,027 locations for a moderate $4,588 average. Panned by critics, the PG-13 film starring Paula Patton as a woman determined to get engaged before her younger sister’s wedding skewed towards an audience of African-American women. Customers liked what they paid for as the CinemaScore grade was an A-.Joseph Gordon-Levitt made a modest debut in fifth place with his first directorial effort Don Jon which grossed an estimated $9M from 2,422 theaters for a soft $3,716 average. The R-rated pic about a ladies man addicted to porn who finally meets Ms. Right (Scarlett Johansson) garnered strong reviews from critics, but was rejected by those who actually paid to see the movie.Its CinemaScore grade was a disappointing C+. That was close to the C- from Ryan Gosling’s Drive from 2011 which was another September pic centered around a hot young male star which won over critics, but got a thumbs down from ticket buyers. Sometimes quality doesn’t sell. A crowded marketplace for adult stories made things tough and the Don Jon opening was almost identical to the $8.6M bow and $3,517 average of the actor’s cancer comedy 50/50 from two years ago this very weekend.Dropping 51% in its third scare was the hit fright sequel Insidious Chapter 2 with an estimated $6.7M giving FilmDistrict a stellar $69.5M to date. Relativity collected an estimated $3.7M for The Family, down 48%, for a $31.7M cume.Falling 37% was the Mexican comedy Instructions Not Included with an estimated $3.4M and a total of $38.6M for Lionsgate. It now stands as the highest-grossing Spanish-language film of all-time in the U.S. surpassing Pan’s Labyrinth.The Jennifer Aniston comedy We’re the Millers became only the second summer film this year to last for eight weeks in the top ten joining Iron Man 3, the year’s top-grossing blockbuster. The sleeper smash took in an estimated $2.9M, off 37%, for a $142.4M sum to date. Rounding out the top ten was the White House hit The Butler with an estimated $2.4M, down 42%, putting The Weinstein Co. at $110.3M.Fox Searchlight enjoyed a solid expansion for its indie romantic comedy Enough Said starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini. Widening from four to 227 locations, the well-reviewed pic grossed an estimated $2.1M for a promising $9,317 average. Enough has banked $2.5M to date. Next weekend’s expansion will see the theater count double, though it will have to lure eyeballs away from Bullock and Clooney.The concert-thriller hybrid Metallica Through the Never opened outside the top ten with its IMAX 3D release debuting to an estimated $1.7M from 308 locations for a $5,429 average which was only moderate given the higher prices. Tickets cost as high as $21.50 each in New York City. The R-rated title earned good reviews and was distributed by Picturehouse which goes wider next weekend into about 650 playdates including conventional screens.The top ten films grossed an estimated $94M which was down 9% from last year when Hotel Transylvania debuted at number one with $42.5M; but up 13% from 2011 when Dolphin Tale climbed into the top spot with $13.9M.Follow the Gitesh on the Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"lord, One, 2020, Marvel, all-time","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Cloudy-with-a-Chance-of-Meatballs-2-Wins-the-Weekend"},{"id":"47509117926127","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Gravity Stuns with Record $55M Launch","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Gravity Stuns with Record $55M Launchby Gitesh Pandya | October 6, 2013 |  CommentsAlfonso Cuarón’s outer space survival thriller Gravity defied conventions both creatively and commercially and smashed the opening weekend record for October with a sensational $55.6M, according to estimates, to lead the North American box office accounting for half of all ticket sales in the top ten. The Warner Bros. release starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney took advantage of a perfect storm of sensational reviews, strong starpower, and awards buzz attracting a huge turnout which was especially impressive given that it was an original film with no built-in audience. It opened like a summer tentpole.Gravity averaged a scorching $15,538 from 3,575 theaters over the weekend and was a major shot in the arm to the 3D and IMAX formats. With its captivating visuals and intense use of CG effects, moviegoers found it a film experience worthy of paying premium ticket prices for. A mind-boggling 80% of the weekend gross came from 3D screens. That’s double the rate that many 3D action films enjoy these days. $11.2M, or 20%, of the gross came from the 323 IMAX locations for a sizzling $34,754 average.Both Bullock and Clooney set new opening weekend career records with Gravity. Bullock just gave herself a new benchmark this past June with the $39.1M debut of The Heat while Clooney, who doesn’t normally have big openings outside of his signature Ocean’s franchise, beat his previous best of $42.9M set way back in 1997 with the mega-flop Batman &amp; Robin.After this weekend, Bullock cements her status as Hollywood’s most bankable actress. Four of her last six films have opened to more than $30M. She was the primary lead in all four and none were franchise movies with built-in audiences. With the romantic comedy The Proposal, the football drama The Blind Side, the buddy cop comedy The Heat, and the space thriller Gravity, the Oscar-winning actress sells across all genres. That sets her apart from Angelina Jolie who struggles to open movies outside of her action safety zone.After generating ample awards buzz by playing a trifecta of key film festivals – Venice, Telluride, and Toronto – Gravity became red hot and then generated fantastic reviews from all around. The PG-13 pic became that rare breed – a prestige picture with broad commercial appeal. Strong marketing helped attract the sci-fi crowd allowing it to pull from multiple audience segments. Friday kicked off with a solid $17.5M while Saturday saw an impressive 31% surge to $23M. Sunday is estimated to drop by 35% to $15M.For October, the space disaster film beat the month’s previous record for best opener which was $52.6M set in 2011 by Paranormal Activity 3. The margin of victory may not have been too much, and the horror hit didn’t have premium ticket prices to boost grosses, however Gravity’s performance was amazing considering it was an original film. The other seven biggest October openings of all-time are either sequels or animated films and until now, no original live-action film had ever opened to north of $40M in either September or October.According to studio research, Gravity skewed more towards the guys with 54% of the audience being male. Not surprising for a movie set almost entirely in space. A very high 59% were over the age of 35 and audience satisfaction was good as the pic earned an A- grade from CinemaScore.Produced for roughly $100M, Gravity opened like a summer blockbuster. In fact, it debuted better than every live-action film released since June’s World War Z starring Clooney’s pal Brad Pitt. Plus the road ahead seems bright given the positive buzz and older audience. That means holdover competition it will give to upcoming mature-skewing adult dramas Captain Phillips and The Fifth Estate will be even stronger.Gravity is just getting started with international territories but it’s already looking to become a fall behemoth with the majority of fans paying extra for the 3D and IMAX formats, just like their North American comrades. 27 markets opened this weekend delivering $27.4M with 3D accounting for an average of 70% of the gross. Russia led with $8.1M, 75% from 3D. The format’s share in Germany was a phenomenal 97% this weekend and 95% in Italy. Key markets like Brazil, Korea, Mexico, France, Japan, and the U.K. are still to come and the studio is still trying to confirm a release in China, the most lucrative overseas market for 3D and IMAX content.Declining by a reasonable 37% from its opening weekend, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 settled for second with an estimated $21.5M for a ten-day tally of $60.6M. That made for a better hold compared to the summer’s pair of toon sequel juggernauts – Monsters University fell 45% and Despicable Me 2 dropped 47%. The first Cloudy dipped just 17% in its sophomore round, but was an original pic with less of a built-in audience. Produced for $78M, the second Cloudy looks to end its domestic run a few notches below the $124.9M of its predecessor.Stumbling into third place was the critically-panned online gambling drama Runner Runner which debuted to just $7.6M, according to estimates, from 3,026 locations for a weak $2,512 average. Fox’s R-rated film starring Justin Timberlake and Ben Affleck (in a lead role but taking the “and” credit) was rejected across the board by reviewers and opened below the $12.1M of the ‘N Sync star’s sci-fi pic In Time from October 2011. Runner cost $30M to produce and after its overseas bow a week ago, worldwide grosses stand at $31.1M.A number of September leftovers followed with each collecting a modest amount. Former number one Prisoners dropped 48% to an estimated $5.7M for a $47.9M total for Warner Bros. Ron Howard’s awards hopeful Rush starring Chris Hemsworth stumbled 56% and took in an estimated $4.4M giving Universal a soft cume of only $18.1M.Don Jon fell a sharp 52% in its sophomore round grossing an estimated $4.2M and just $16.1M after ten days for Relativity. Star Joseph Gordon-Levitt along with Hemsworth and Timberlake make up members of the new generation of male leads, but all have failed to attract notable sales with their recent films this fall.Falling 54% to an estimated $4.1M was Fox Searchlight’s romantic comedy Baggage Claim which has taken in $15.2M to date. Horror hit Insidious Chapter 2 followed with an estimated $3.9M, down 41%, putting FilmDistrict at an impressive $74.8M.The second Spanish-language hit of the fall entered the top ten as the Mexico City-set romantic comedy Pulling Strings debuted to an estimated $2.5M from 387 locations for a respectable $6,460 average. The PG-rated film earned a glowing A+ CinemaScore for Lionsgate and was produced by Latino studio Pantelion which saw its last film Instructions Not Included spend the past five weeks in the national top ten following its $7.8M opening weekend. Its current total is a stellar $41.3M.Rounding out the top ten was the arthouse comedy Enough Said starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini which nearly doubled its run and collected an estimated $2.2M from 437 locations for a $4,920 average. Cume for Fox Searchlight is $5.4M.Ahead of next weekend’s nationwide roll-out, Sony’s Somali pirate drama Captain Phillips starring Tom Hanks got a round of 800 sneak previews on Saturday night to help bolster buzz for the tough-to-sell pic. The studio reported that the sneaks were 75% full on average and that many shows were sold out across all regions of the country. Research showed that the audience was split evenly between males and females and that the crowd was very mature with 71% being over 35.

In North America, the Katniss sequel debuted to an estimated $161.1M making it the second largest debut of the year and the fourth biggest of all-time. The only stronger films all benefited from 3D ticket prices — The Avengers with $207.4M, this year’s Iron Man 3 with $174.1M, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 with $169.2M.If estimates hold, Fire will edge past the $160.9M of The Dark Knight Rises which until now held the record for the biggest opening of a 2D film (it was also affected by a shooting tragedy). Sunday estimates are guesses after all and final numbers to be reported on Monday will indicate whether it ends at number four or five on the all-time list. Playing in 4,163 theaters — a new record for a non-summer release – the PG-13 pic averaged a scorching $38,704. The gross was 6% better than the $152.5M launch of the first Hunger Games movie a year and a half ago. That film also set the all-time 2D record. Regardless of how the final numbers shape up, Catching Fire easily set new all-time highs for both November and non-summer debuts beating the $142.8M of The Twilight Saga: A New Moon set in 2009.What was truly remarkable about the new Hunger flick was how it held up on Saturday. Its decline from opening day was the exact same as for its predecessor which was amazing considering how Fire is a sequel and also had an earlier start with shows beginning at 8:00pm on Thursday night instead of midnight for the first Panem pic. Fire was expected to be more front-loaded and have a larger Saturday fall.The fireworks began with the official Friday opening day gross of $70.9M including $25.3M from Thursday night shows. Saturday dipped 25% to $53M while Sunday is estimated to slide by 30% to $37.3M. The first Hunger Games fell 31% on Sunday although that was a March release when there was no NFL football that day. Should Catching Fire end up with a 35% decline on Sunday, that would put the opening weekend at about $158M. A deep freeze across the northeast and midwest on Sunday may also impact the entire moviegoing landscape. Many industry observers were expecting an even larger debut north of $170M, however regardless of expectations, this tentpole delivered sensational results and will certainly be a profitable venture.Book franchises work in mysterious ways. The second Twilight opened in November a year after the first and saw twice as much business on opening weekend. But Hunger Games seems to be performing more like the Harry Potter series. The first wizard pic broke the all-time opening weekend record and then its follow-up one year later opened a tiny bit below it. Fans made a mad rush to see the debut film and then attendance dipped a notch on the second installment. For Fire, it inched up a tad but was basically in the same neighborhood. Reviews for Fire were terrific with most major critics finding it better than its predecessor. Audiences liked what they paid for as the CinemaScore grade was an A just like last time.Like most 2D and 3D tentpoles, Catching Fire had an IMAX version which was quite popular with hard-core fans willing to pay a premium for a better experience. $12.6M of the gross (8%) came from those large-format screens setting a new three-day opening record in November edging out the $12.5M from last year’s Skyfall. Worldwide IMAX grosses stand at more than $18M. Studio research showed that the new Hunger Games played 59% female and those over and under 25 were evenly split.Overseas, Catching Fire rolled out across 62 territories this weekend grossing a sensational $146.6M including the first full week in Brazil which opened a week earlier. Lionsgate reported that it more than doubled the first movie’s openings in most major territories. The global tally sits at $307.7M and the smash hit could crush the half-billion mark after next weekend.Far back in second place with an estimated $14.1M was the comic hit Thor: The Dark World which tumbled 61% due to competition from another event sequel (and Hemsworth lad). The Disney release has grossed $167.8M so far in North America and $548.8M worldwide. China still leads the international marketplace with $48.3M and Japan is the final major market still to open.Yet another November sequel followed. The Best Man Holiday fell 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $12.5M lifting the cume to $50.4M. Despite the A+ Cinemascore, the Universal release played like a sequel with a built-in audience and dropped sharply. A final near the $75-80M range could result and a third film in the series is being developed.Stating once again that they will not pay money to see Vince Vaughn do the same character for the 25th time, audiences rejected the actor’s latest effort Delivery Man which opened in fourth with a lousy $8.2M, according to estimates. Averaging a wimpy $2,706 from 3,036 locations, the PG-13 film about a man whose sperm donations helped create 533 children followed the disappointing $17.3M bow of Vaughn’s The Internship from last summer as well as the $12.8M of his previous film The Watch. Although the funnyman anchored five hits opening to $30M+ between 2004 and 2009, he has not had any hits in four years now. Reviews were weak.Relativity’s toon Free Birds grossed an estimated $5.3M, down 35%, for a $48.6M total. The comedy Last Vegas witnessed its biggest drop yet sliding 48% in its fourth frame to an estimated $4.4M with $53.9M to date for CBS Films.Getting to within striking distance of the century club, Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa fell 54% to an estimated $3.5M giving Paramount $95.5M so far. The Sandra Bullock megahit Gravity placed eighth with an estimated $3.3M, down 46% in its eighth round, for a domestic take of $245.5M. A massive $35.5M China opening over six days propelled the overseas total to $331.5M and the global tally to a sensational $577M.Two potential Oscar contenders rounded out the top ten. Fox Searchlight’s 12 Years A Slave slipped 39% to an estimated $2.8M and has banked $29.4M to date. Focus expanded its Matthew McConaughey drama Dallas Buyers Club from 184 to 666 locations and collected an estimated $2.8M as well for a lukewarm $4,159 average and $6.5M total.In a special exclusive engagement at one Disney-owned L.A. theater, the studio’s animated feature Frozen got off to an explosive start grossing a phenomenal $238,000 this weekend from the solo venue in a run leading up to Wednesday’s nationwide release in over 3,600 theaters. The exclusive event featured special bonuses for moviegoers and tickets were priced between $13 for just the film for kids to $51 for a VIP package that included breakfast, popcorn, soda, reserved seating and no waiting in line. Several Disney toons in the past started with a very limited platform run including The Lion King, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast.The top ten films grossed an estimated $218M which was down 9% from last year’s pre-Thanksgiving frame when tentpole The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 opened at number one with $141.1M; but up 2% from 2011 when Breaking Dawn Part 1 debuted in the top spot with $138.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"series, Rom-Com","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Catching-Fire-Toasts-the-Competition"},{"id":"47509116210923","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Ender Bender as Game Wins No. 1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Ender Bender as Game Wins No. 1Meanwhile, Thor thunders out globally, Bad Grandpa stays strong, and Orson Scott Card loves our headline.by Gitesh Pandya | November 3, 2013 |  CommentsA week before the Hemsworth brothers begin their double feature of November tentpoles, the sci-fi entry Ender’s Game opened atop the North American box office and was joined in the top five by fellow new releases Last Vegas and Free Birds, all of which posted moderate or respectable launches.Debuting to an estimated $28M, the effects-driven futuristic action pic Ender’s Game landed in the number one spot with a performance that was reasonably good, but not especially impressive for an expensive production. Based on the best-selling novel, the PG-13 film averaged $8,218 from 3,407 locations including higher-priced IMAX and other large-format screens. Reviews were mixed for the Lionsgate release and the CinemaScore grade was a middling B+. Tapping into a built-in audience, not having any standout buzz, and facing the arrival of Thor: The Dark World next weekend, Game is not likely to last very long and should finish up with a front-loaded theatrical run.Bad Grandpa enjoyed the best second weekend hold ever for a Jackass film dipping only 36% to an estimated $20.5M giving Paramount a healthy $62.1M in ten days. The low-cost $15M comedy should end its domestic run with about $110M making for yet another profitable installment for the eleven-year-old franchise. Fan feedback has been excellent.The old timers comedy Last Vegas opened in third pace with an estimated $16.5M from 3,065 theaters for a respectable $5,390 average. Starring Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Kline, the PG-13 film about a group of old friends reuniting for a bachelor party in Sin City played to a mature crowd as expected. Critics were not too impressed, but moviegoers came out for the CBS Films release for the starpower and premise.Audience data showed that 53% were female and an understandably high 83% were 25 and older. With a promising A- CinemaScore grade, a much older target audience, and no major direct competition coming, Vegas should be able to hold up well throughout the November weeks ahead and reach a domestic gross that doubles the $28M production cost.2013 has been a tough year for animated films – especially those that are not on the very top tier – and Free Birds was the latest to lack excitement with family audiences. The PG-rated turkey flick debuted to an estimated $16.2M from 3,736 theaters for a mild $4,336 average. Relativity had relatively clear sailing for its launch as the only other kidpic out there – Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 – was in its sixth weekend. But the target audience was not excited to spend top dollar for this toon and reviews were lousy.No animated films open until Thanksgiving so the distributor is hoping that lack of competition will help in the days and weeks ahead. The A- CinemaScore indicates that customers were fairly pleased with their purchase. Even bigger players like DreamWorks, Fox, and Sony have struggled to make toons work this year.Space juggernaut Gravity fell back to fifth place but still posted a solid frame grossing an estimated $13.1M making for the best fifth weekend gross for any film since The Avengers. Warner Bros. has banked a stunning $219.2M to date making it the highest-grossing non-franchise film of 2013, and number eight overall. The Bullock blockbuster also smashed the $200M international and $400M global marks this weekend. The $27.1M overseas weekend gross pushed the offshore cume to $207.5M with worldwide climbing up to $426.7M.Captain Phillips, another star-driven survival thriller getting Oscar buzz, followed with an estimated $8.5M. Down only 27%, the Tom Hanks film stands at $82.6M to date.Fox Searchlight gave another expansion to its awards hopeful 12 Years A Slave which widened from 123 to 410 theaters and more than doubled its weekend gross in the process. The acclaimed period drama took in an estimated $4.6M and posted another promising average with $11,220 putting it in good shape for the road ahead. Many prestige films stumble when expanding to this many markets but Slave is remaining a relevant and much-talked-about film bringing in new audiences thanks in part to stellar reviews. Cume is $8.8M and next weekend it expands again into roughly 1,000 locations.Three C’s rounded out the top ten. Toon sequel Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 dropped 33% to an estimated $4.2M for a $106.2M cume for Sony. Horror flick Carrie grossed an estimated $3.4M, down 43%, giving Sony $32M to date. Fox’s crime drama The Counselor tumbled 59% in its sophomore round to an estimated $3.3M putting the total at just $13.6M.Rachel McAdams saw lackluster results for her latest romance About Time which was given a limited release in only 175 locations this weekend by Universal. The R-rated time travel love story bowed to an estimated $1.1M for a mild average of $6,046 which does not bode well for next weekend’s nationwide expansion. Reviews have been mixed.Generating plenty of must-see awards buzz – especially in the acting categories – was Dallas Buyers Club which delivered a superb platform launch over the weekend as the final release for the current incarnation of Focus Features. The Matthew McConaughey film bowed to an estimated $264,000 from only nine locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto for a strong $29,333 average. The R-rated true story expands on Friday to a dozen new markets – including Dallas – and will be everywhere by November 22. Reviews were sensational and McConaughey is seen as a major contender for the Academy Award for Best Actor.A week ahead of its domestic launch, the super hero tentpole Thor: The Dark World opened across much of the planet this weekend taking in a sensational $109.4M from 36 markets led by $13.4M in the U.K. The second Thor flick lands in over 3,800 North American theaters this Friday (with first shows beginning at 8:00pm on Thursday night) and has scared away all other new wide releases. China also opens next weekend so the global tally will soar by the end of next weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $118.3M which was even with last year when Wreck-it Ralph opened at number one with $49M; but up 18% from 2011 when Puss in Boots stayed in the top spot with $33.1M in its second weekend.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Arrowverse, ITV, Kids, Arts, America, Awards, 2018, toy, Musical","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Ender-Bender-as-Game-Wins-No-1"},{"id":"47509117922029","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Gravity Still #1, Heading to $500M+ Global","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Gravity Still #1, Heading to $500M+ Globalby Gitesh Pandya | October 20, 2013 |  CommentsGrossing more than all the new releases combined, the space smash Gravity led the North American box office with ease for the third straight time collecting an estimated $31M. The Warner Bros. blockbuster displayed tremendous legs once again by slipping only 28% allowing the 17-day cume to soar to an eye-popping $170.6M. Only one 2013 film has grossed more in its third weekend – the year’s top hit Iron Man 3 which did $35.8M. And The Butler was the only other film this year to spend three weeks at number one with its third frame winning only thanks to a holiday.Gravity is tapping into repeat business and is broadening its audience as newcomers are finding the Sandra Bullock-George Clooney disaster pic through stellar word-of-mouth. A final trajectory towards the $250-275M range seems likely for the domestic market which would be third best for the year. These are summer-like grosses in the fall. An incredible $38M has come from the 318 IMAX screens representing 22% of the total and that amount could climb up to about $60M which is more than what most new films opening this month will make from all screens.Bullock has now become the first star of 2013 to anchor two different hits grossing over $150M domestic each. Her summer action-comedy The Heat has grossed $159.3M to date and also had a leggy run thanks to high customer satisfaction. The Oscar-winning actress has now led four hits past the $150M mark over the last four years and is arguably the most bankable star in Hollywood today, male or female.Overseas, Gravity was tops again pulling in $33.5M from 51 markets pushing the international total to $114.2M and the worldwide tally to $284.8M. Korea and Mexico scored solid openings this weekend with $7.1M and $5.7M, respectively, while Russia leads overall with $17.3M after its third weekend. Some huge markets are still to come such as France, the U.K., China and Japan so surpassing $500M next month will not be a problem for the Alfonso Cuaron-directed thriller.Tom Hanks enjoyed a solid hold for his hostage thriller Captain Phillips which followed its strong opening with a 33% decline to an estimated $17.3M for an impressive ten-day tally of $53.3M. The sophomore weekend gross was even bigger than the first weekend debuts of all of the actor’s live-action films from this decade – Larry Crowne ($13.1M), Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close ($10M), and Cloud Atlas ($9.6M). Sony is on track to surpass the $100M mark with Phillips which is especially remarkable given the competition for adults from Gravity. Hanks and Bullock have banked substantial likability points over their careers and are now cashing them in with well-made films about Americans in peril.The horror flick Carrie opened in third place with an estimated $17M from 3,157 theaters for a lukewarm $5,385 average. Sony’s remake of the high school fright tale was aimed at today’s generation of teens and young adults and opened at the low end of expectations. Given that it was the only horror title for the Halloween month of October, the performance was a bit underwhelming. The production cost was reportedly near the $30M mark.Studio research from Sony showed predictable results – 54% of the crowd was female and 56% was under 25. Reviews were mixed, but not bad enough to scare away the target audience of young adults. And the B- CinemaScore grade is respectable for this genre. Positioned in part as a supernatural thriller, the poster featuring star Chloe Grace Moretz’s blood-soaked head may have been a turn-off for many young women who prefer spooks over gore.Getting to within striking distance of the century club, the toon sequel Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 followed with an estimated $10.1M sliding by only 27%. Sony has banked $93.1M to date and after four weekends the 3D food pic is running only 3% behind the pace of its 2009 predecessor.Former box office kings Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger teamed up for the new prison action thriller Escape Plan but pulled in a soft amount of business with an estimated $9.8M opening weekend. Averaging a mild $3,399 from 2,883 locations, the R-rated pic played to older men. Studio research showed that males made up 55% (surprisingly low for this type of testosterone flick) and 61% over 30. Reviews were not too great but audiences were fairly pleased as Escape earned a B+ CinemaScore grade. The actors fared worse early this year with solo projects as Stallone’s Bullet to the Head bowed to $4.5M while Schwarzenegger’s The Last Stand debuted to $6.3M. International and ancillary markets should deliver better results for this type of product.The kidnapping thriller Prisoners dropped 43% to an estimated $2.1M this weekend and Warner Bros. has taken in a solid $57.3M so far. Adding 151 theaters, Fox Searchlight’s indie comedy hit Enough Said jumped back into the top ten with a remarkable hold easing a scant 6% to an estimated $1.8M. Cume is now $10.8M from 757 theaters.Audiences showed no interest in paying to see the new WikiLeaks movie The Fifth Estate. The Disney release opened poorly to an estimated $1.7M from 1,769 locations for a miserable $969 average. Rarely do wide openers fail to crack an average of $1,000 per location and this R-rated drama about Julian Assange and his web site for whistleblowers had no subject matter that could draw in moviegoers. Bad reviews hurt and the cast lacked any stars that could pull in business, although lead Benedict Cumberbatch did win praise for his performance. Competition for sophisticated adult audiences crushed it too. Openings in Spain and the U.K. have also been weak. Estate won the high-profile opening night slot of last month’s Toronto International Film Festival, but attracted negative buzz once more critics and industry people saw the film.The Justin Timberlake-Ben Affleck online gambling thriller Runner Runner fell 57% to ninth place with an estimated $1.6M giving Fox only $17.5M to date. Rounding out the top ten was this year’s second biggest horror hit Insidious Chapter 2 with an estimated $1.5M, off 44%, for a $80.9M total.Leveraging sensational reviews and loads of Oscar talk, the acclaimed period drama 12 Years A Slave debuted to fantastic results in limited release with an estimated $960,000 from only 19 theaters in six markets for a promising $50,526 average. Directed by Steve McQueen (Shame), the R-rated film stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard and Fifth Estate’s Cumberbatch.Fox Searchlight will take Slave into more than 100 sites next weekend opening in additional markets hoping for a prolonged fall run that can reach a broad spectrum of audiences thanks to reviews and buzz. The film is currently seen as one of the front-runners to win the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor, although it is still incredibly early in the awards race. Academy voting runs from February 14 to 25 with the ceremony on March 2.The top ten films grossed an estimated $94M which was down 19% from last year when Paranormal Activity 4 debuted at number one with $29M; and down 11% from 2011 when Paranormal Activity 3 opened in the top spot with $52.6M. This is the first October in ten years without a Paranormal or Saw installment.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Netflix, BBC, TV+","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Gravity-Still-1-Heading-to-500M-Global"},{"id":"47509119437564","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Despicable Me 2 Crushes Holiday Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Despicable Me 2 Crushes Holiday WeekendPlus, Lone Ranger underwhelms, and Kevin Hart surprises.by Gitesh Pandya | July 7, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, toon bad guy Gru dominated the box office with a gargantuan debut for his animated sequel Despicable Me 2 which drove the marketplace to a new record for the Independence Day holiday frame. Meanwhile, Johnny Depp attracted disappointing numbers to his new summer tentpole The Lone Ranger which finished in second. People caught up on a wide variety of holdovers (and free air conditioning) as the top ten surged to a scorching $218M.Universal overperformed and took in an estimated $82.5M this weekend for its toon giant Despicable Me 2 with the full debut period clocking in at an astounding $142.1M since its first shows starting at 7:00pm on Tuesday evening. The PG-rated smash averaged a sizzling $20,645 over the Friday-to-Sunday portion from 3,997 theaters. By comparison, the summer’s other big animated sequel Monsters University grossed $105.3M in its first five days, although over a non-holiday period.The first Despicable debuted three years ago in July 2010 to $56.4M and was a leggy hit finishing with nearly five times its opening with $251.5M. Fan love for Gru and his Minions grew over the years and now the sequel has capitalized on it. And like Shrek 2 before it, DM2 scored huge numbers by being both a toon for families and a mainstream comedy for teens and young adults.Reviews were quite good for a sequel and audiences gave a big thumbs up with a glowing A grade from CinemaScore. Studio research showed that the crowd was 60% female and 55% under 25. With a $76M production cost, DM2 is sure to be a major moneymaker spawning more sequels (and fat paychecks) for Steve Carell and company. Universal already has a spin-off film for the Minions on the calendar for December 2014.International grosses were fantastic too. Despicable Me 2 grossed a stellar $88.8M over the weekend from 45 markets pushing the overseas take to $151.1M and the global gross to an eye-popping $293.2M with much more to come. Reaching the billion mark cannot be ruled out at this point.Debuting in second place with less than spectacular results was Johnny Depp’s big-budget Western adventure film The Lone Ranger with an estimated $29.4M over three days and $48.9M since its Tuesday night launch at 7:00pm. Directed by Gore Verbinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the PG-13 period pic even opened below the $70.6M five-day launch of the team’s Pirates of the Caribbean from ten years ago this very month. Factor in a decade worth of ticket price increases and the audience was roughly half the size.Reviews were very negative and a film based on the Lone Ranger brand was not exactly something audiences were asking for. Last summer, Dark Shadows proved that ticket buyers will no longer come out automatically to see Depp do yet another eccentric role. The film actually needs to be good and look compelling. With a reported production budget of at least $215M not counting an aggressive marketing push, this is a huge investment from Disney which will be difficult to recoup. The CinemaScore was a B+ which was decent, but nothing special. And new action films will open every Friday over the next several weeks so the road ahead looks treacherous for Tonto.Overseas, Lone Ranger opened in 24 markets representing only 30% of the international marketplace so it was not a full upfront roll-out. The weekend delivered $24.3M with a global take so far of $73.2M. Russia easily led with $6.6M while key markets Australia, Italy, and Korea were not impressive.The Sandra Bullock-Melissa McCarthy cop comedy The Heat held up well in its second weekend taking in an estimated $25M slipping only 36% thanks to a potent combo of a holiday session plus solid buzz. With $86.4M so far, look for the Fox hit to reach $150M or more.Disney and Pixar’s Monsters University took a direct hit from the Minions tumbling 57% to an estimated $19.6M after spending back-to-back weekends at number one. Cume sits at $216.1M while the global tally crossed $400M. Brad Pitt captured an estimated $18.2M with the zombie thriller World War Z, off 39%, putting Paramount at $158.8M to date domestic and $366.2M worldwide.More action offerings followed for those moviegoers who wanted their fireworks on the big screen this weekend. Sony’s actioner White House Down dropped a reasonable 46% to an estimated $13.5M and $50.5M total. Man of Steel was still in eight-digit territory with an estimated $11.4M in its fourth round, down 45%, for a $271.2M sum. $300M domestic is still within reach.The standup comedy concert Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain made a sparkling debut with an estimated $10.1M from 876 theaters for a superb three-day average of $11,530. Since its Wednesday launch, the R-rated Lionsgate release has banked an impressive $17.5M after just five days. That’s already more than twice the $7.7M total gross from the comedian’s last concert pic Laugh at My Pain which played in under 300 theaters. The success of that low-budget hit opened the door to Explain getting a high profile holiday slot and triple the theaters and the gamble paid off.Sony’s doomsday comedy hit This is the End followed with an estimated $5.8M, off just 33%, for a $85.6M cume to date heading towards the century mark. Rounding out the top ten was the sleeper success Now You See Me which fell 51% to an estimated $2.8M giving Lionsgate $110.4M so far.As if ruling the holiday box office wasn’t enough, Steve Carell also made an impressive debut on the specialty scene with the indie comedy The Way, Way Back which opened to an estimated $575,000 from 19 theaters across eight markets for a potent $30,263 average for Fox Searchlight. The critically acclaimed summer vacation pic expands to most other major cities over the next two weeks.The top ten films grossed an estimated $218.3M which was up 23% from last year when The Amazing Spider-Man opened at number one with $62M; and up a healthy 55% from 2011 when Transformers: Dark of the Moon debuted in the top spot with $47.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Biopics, razzies, TV, Festival, A24, Teen, Lifetime, and, Academy, ABC, of, of, Con","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Despicable-Me-2-Crushes-Holiday-Weekend"},{"id":"47509117949689","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Wolverine Tops Weekend with $55M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Wolverine Tops Weekend with $55Mby Gitesh Pandya | July 29, 2013 |  CommentsHollywood’s latest super hero offering took command of the box office as Hugh Jackman’s return to Adamantium action in The Wolverine resulted in a number one opening. The popular Marvel character took in an estimated $55M from 3,924 locations for a solid $14,016 average. The debut was almost identical to the $55.1M debut of the franchise’s last film X-Men: First Class which opened in June 2011. That summer’s Thor and Captain America films bowed to about $65M a piece.It can be argued that Wolverine could have attracted a slightly larger audience given its more well-known character and marquee star. However, every action film this month has debuted at or below expectations following an endless number of action titles since the first week of May. The clawed hero did deliver the biggest live-action opening in over a month. The character’s last full feature was 2009’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine which opened to $85.1M, but against zero competition. Bad will from that poorly-received film may have taken part of the fan base out of the equation this time around.Set mostly in Japan, The Wolverine played to an expected crowd that skewed towards adult males. Studio research showed that 58% of the audience was male and 58% was 25 and older. Reviews were generally positive and paying moviegoers liked the PG-13 film giving it a good A- CinemaScore grade.A massive global roll-out this weekend led to a big $86.1M international opening weekend from 101 territories for a powerful $141.1M worldwide launch. Most key markets opened this weekend though Japan will not release until September. The Wolverine cost a reported $120M to produce and had no expensive players outside of the lead actor.Horror smash The Conjuring followed its spectacular opening with a terrific second weekend with an estimated $22.1M boosting the ten-day total to an incredible $83.9M. Off only 47%, the Warner Bros. release enjoyed an unusually low decline for a fright film and continues to benefit from strong audience buzz. A final domestic gross of about $140M is likely – among the best in history for a scary movie. Conjuring cost only $20M to produce.Mega-toon Despicable Me 2 eased just 36% in its fourth round and cracked the triple-century mark with an estimated $16M for a cume to date of $306.4M for Universal. Gru’s audience love and longevity has taken some of the speed out of rival animated offering Turbo which nonetheless held up well in its sophomore lap with an estimated $13.3M, off just 38%. With $55.8M in 12 days, Fox’s final domestic total might end in the $90-100M range. Kid competition will ramp up starting this Wednesday with Smurfs 2.Sequels for grown ups followed. Adam Sandler’s Grown Ups 2 fell 42% to an estimated $11.5M for Sony putting the total at $101.7M – the bankable star’s 14th $100M+ domestic grosser. Lionsgate saw its action pic Red 2 take in an estimated $9.4M, down 48%, resulting in a $35.1M sum.Hoping to reach nine-digit territory, the sci-fi monster jam Pacific Rim collected an estimated $7.5M, down 53%, giving Warner Bros. $84M thus far on its way to $100M.Leggy cop comedy The Heat dipped only 26% to an estimated $6.9M raising the total to $141.2M for Fox. Universal’s R.I.P.D., Hollywood’s umpteenth action offering this summer, fell apart in its second weekend with an estimated $5.9M falling 54%. The pricey flop has banked a miserable $24.4M and should end with a dismal $35-40M, one of the most memorable failures of this year.Indie hit Fruitvale Station expanded nationwide and jumped into the top ten with a decent, but not spectacular showing. The Weinstein Co. release about the final day in the life of a young unarmed man shot and killed by the police grossed an estimated $4.7M from 1,064 locations for a mediocre $4,377 average. Total stands at $6.3M. Based on a true story, the urban drama attracted publicity for its similaritires to the killing of Trayvon Martin which has been a major news story over the last two years. But as with mainstream films, indie pics with dark and serious tones can often struggle to find a large audience in the summer when people crave lighter, more upbeat fare.Making a major splash on the specialty scene was Woody Allen with his latest comic creation, Blue Jasmine starring Cate Blanchett, which grossed an estimated $613,000 from only six theaters for a jaw-dropping $102,167 average per site. Sony Classics will continue to roll out the well-reviewed film in the weeks ahead as the actress attracts Oscar buzz.Opening to soft results was the indie comedy The To-Do List with an estimated $1.5M from 591 locations for a weak $2,597 average. The CBS Films release stars Aubrey Plaza as a high school nerd trying to lose her virginity.The top ten films grossed an estimated $152.3M which was up 23% from last year when The Dark Knight Rises remained at number one with $62.1M; but off 9% from 2011 when Cowboys &amp; Aliens opened in the top spot with $36.4M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Islander, thriller, SXSW, Premiere, Universal, Epix, Fire","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Wolverine-Tops-Weekend-with-55M"},{"id":"47509119443711","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Man of Steel Sets June Record","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Man of Steel Sets June RecordThis Is the End follows at #2, and Now You See Me holds on to #3.by Gitesh Pandya | June 16, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, Superman was reborn at the box office as the big-budget gamble Man of Steel paid off handsomely with a spectacular opening weekend in North America plus impressive launches overseas in only a portion of the international marketplace. The Warner Bros. summer tentpole grossed an estimated $113.1M domestically, breaking the record for the biggest June opening ever. Adding in $12M from Thursday night group sales led by Walmart’s promotion for 7:00pm shows, the total stood at a stellar $125.1M. The Friday-to-Sunday portion for the PG-13 film averaged a muscular $26,879 from 4,207 theaters including 331 IMAX screens. Toy Story 3 held the June record since 2010 with $110.3M.The 3.5-day performance exceeded the extended seven-day holiday opening of 2006’s reboot Superman Returns which amounted to $108.1M during the week leading up to Independence Day. That mega-budgeted film eventually inched its way into the double century club ending with $200.1M but was seen as a creative and commercial disappointment which failed to lead to a new franchise being born. The new reboot may match the last one’s gross by the end of next weekend.Man of Steel was directed by Zack Snyder with Henry Cavill taking on the title role and also featured an Oscar-caliber cast including Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Michael Shannon and Laurence Fishburne. Christopher Nolan, who successfully rebooted the Batman franchise for the studio, produced Steel and lent much to the box office pull of the film. After getting the origin story out of the way in 2005’s Batman Begins, grosses soared even higher for the next two chapters leading to a $2.5 billion global trilogy, so it was crucial for Warner Bros. to relaunch Superman in a way that brought in the masses.Reviews were mixed but paying audiences gave the super hero flick an encouraging A- grade from CinemaScore. Friday debuted to $44.1M including $9M in midnight shows. Saturday fell an understandable 18% to $36.3M while Sunday was projected to dip by only 10% to $32.7M thanks to the Father’s Day holiday. Much of the film’s story involves Superman’s two dads from Krypton and Earth and how they molded him.Studio research showed that Man of Steel skewed towards men as expected with 56% being male. But that made for a better female turnout than usual for a comic book pic. Iron Man 3 and Avengers were both 61% male and last summer’s Spider-Man reboot played 58% male. The stronger cross-gender appeal could allow it to play well over the coming weeks especially with the Fourth of July holiday around the corner.3,350 theaters offered a 3D option with those screens accounting for 41% of the gross. With conversions, even for effects-driven action pictures, audiences nowadays typically prefer the original 2D version at regular prices instead. IMAX venues contributed 12% of the total gross with $13.3M and a sturdy average of $40,181 since Thursday night. Tickets cost as much as $21.50 to experience Man of Steel in IMAX 3D in New York City. Massive cross-promotions with brand partners helped to drive in business too for the event film.The international launch for Man of Steel was also quite strong even though many top markets open later. The weekend saw $71.6M from 24 markets led by the U.K., Mexico, and Korea which were the only majors to open this week. 27 new countries will launch next weekend including key territories like France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia and China so Man of Steel has much more ahead this summer. But so far, the first weekend delivered $196.7M in global sales.Opening far behind in second place was the new doomsday comedy This is the End with an estimated $20.5M over three days and $32.8M since its launch on Tuesday night with 7:00pm shows. It was a respectable opening for the Sony release especially considering the distraction Clark Kent had over the target audience of young men. Playing in 3,055 locations, the raunchy R-rated comedy starring Seth Rogen, James Franco, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill and Jay Baruchel averaged $6,710 over the Friday-to-Sunday period. The full gross was below the $41.3M five-day debut of Pineapple Express in August 2008 which was from many of the same team members.Reviews were very solid for End but the CinemaScore grade was a B+ which is commendable, not glowing. The road ahead features plenty of new action movies which will continue to lure in young men so it will not be easy. But Rogen and company hope that word-of-mouth will help it reach many more moviegoers over the weeks ahead, especially those who want a rowdy laugh and are all actioned out. Studio research showed that the crowd was 60% male and 52% over 25. With a $32M production budget and marketing costs not in the same league as summer tentpoles, the comedy should turn out to be a moneymaker regardless of how it plays overseas.Holding steady in third place was Lionsgate’s heist thriller Now You See Me with an estimated $10.3M, down 46%, for a robust cume to date of $80M. Now the top-grossing installment of the franchise, Universal’s Fast &amp; Furious 6 followed with an estimated $9.4M dropping 52% pushing the domestic tally to a muscular $219.6M. Worldwide, it’s also the highest-grossing Furious flick with a total now of $636.9M and still growing.Last week’s top film The Purge got beaten down tumbling a frightening 76% to an estimated $8.2M. The micro-budgeted $3M pic has nonetheless raked in a healthy $52M in ten days for Universal. The Fox comedy The Internship fell a troubling 60% in its second weekend to an estimated $7M putting the Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson pic at a disappointing $31M.Dropping 50% to an estimated $6M in its fourth round was the animated film Epic which has collected $95.4M to date for Fox. Star Trek Into Darkness followed with an estimated $5.7M, off 51%, for an impressive $210.5M for Paramount.The summer’s most notable flop so far, Will Smith’s critically panned father-son sci-fi adventure After Earth, crumbled 65% to an estimated $3.8M for a lousy $54.2M cume to date for the pricey $130M gamble. Flirting with the quadruple century mark, Iron Man 3 rounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.9M in its seventh weekend, down 50%. Disney has grossed $399.6M to date and $1.2 billion globally.The top ten films grossed an estimated $186.8M which was up a stellar 55% from last year when Madagascar 3 remained at number one with $34.1M; and up 29% from 2011 when Green Lantern debuted in the top spot with $53.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Winners, psychological","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Man-of-Steel-Sets-June-Record"},{"id":"47509119451907","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Star Trek Softer Than Expected at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Star Trek Softer Than Expected at #1by Gitesh Pandya | May 20, 2013 |  CommentsVulcans and their comrades came out to power the sci-fi sequel Star Trek Into Darkness into the number one spot at the North American box office, however grosses were substantially below industry expectations across the board. The Paramount franchise film had an extended release and grossed $70.6M over the Friday-to-Sunday period with a total of $84.1M since its start on Wednesday night in IMAX locations making for a debut that was smaller than its 2009 predecessor’s.The studio chose to make the highly anticipated 3D tentpole available to fans earlier via premium large-format screens. The release kicked off on Wednesday with about $2M in ticket sales from 336 higher-priced IMAX 3D screens with shows starting at 8:00pm. Thursday was the official full opening day with $11.5M in business. The figure was not too impressive, however the release date was changed very late in the game from Friday so not all moviegoers knew about the earlier debut. Friday jumped 91% to $22.1M, Saturday climbed another 25% to $27.5M and Sunday was estimated to drop 24% to $21M. Over the Friday-to-Sunday period, the new Trek averaged $18,241 from 3,868 locations.Four years ago, Star Trek opened in a slightly different format. It was slotted into the second weekend of May with a Friday release kicking off with Thursday night shows in all theaters starting at 7:00pm. It had an IMAX release in 138 locations, but was all 2D. Its opening was $75.2M over the three-day period and $79.2M including $4M from Thursday night shows. Add in that film’s Monday gross to make a similar 4.5-day start, and its $86.7M was bigger than the $84.1M of Darkness despite the new chapter having higher 2D ticket prices plus 3D surcharges plus 200 additional IMAX screens.Studio research showed that the audience was 64% male and 73% 25 and older. A very high 16% of the gross ($13.5M) came from IMAX indicating that fans were willing to pay extra in this case given that about 30 minutes of the film were shot with those special cameras making for a premium experience. Overall, 45% of the gross came from 3D screens including IMAX.The underperforming numbers of Into Darkness were downright baffling. Paramount made a good product and picked a fine time to release it giving it two weeks distance from the summer’s other action tentpole Iron Man 3. Reviews were mostly positive (more than good enough for a sci-fi sequel) and audiences also liked the film with opening day ticket buyers giving an A grade from CinemaScore. The marketing push was strong and normal for May action tentpoles. 2009’s Star Trek not only opened well, it also had solid legs with 70% of its domestic business coming after the first weekend. Sequels to leggy blockbusters like these usually open bigger, especially if 3D is added in.Before the film’s release, Paramount openly predicted a $100M opening through Sunday. Studios routinely low-ball these forecasts so the final numbers end up looking like they are above expectations. So the performance was probably much lower than what the studio internally believed was likely.If internal factors were not to blame, it may have been external ones that were in play – namely competition and erosion of audience interest. Competition that the two Trek movies faced was almost identical, although allocated differently. The rest of the Top 15 films this weekend grossed $77M which was 10% more than the $70M that 2009’s Trek faced. Factor in four years of ticket price increases and the same number of people saw competing movies each time.But what was in fact different was how much the second and third place films dominated the rest of the marketplace while all other movies made chump change. In both years, the runnerup pic was a superhero flick (Iron Man 3 and 2009’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and the third place film was a female-skewing pic (The Great Gatsby and 2009’s Ghosts of Girlfriends Past). This year’s duo grossed a stellar $58.6M, up a whopping 60% from 2009’s $36.7M. This weekend’s two holdovers were an awesome twosome that combined for the highest gross in box office history for the second and third place movies on the critical third weekend of May and they may have taken away some of Trek’s potential audience.Darkness also came out four years after the Star Trek reboot and some fans, especially those who are not die-hard ones, may have lost interest in the franchise during that gap. The first nine Star Trek films spanned two decades and never had a gap this big. 2002’s Nemesis came out after a four-year void, ended up as the lowest-grossing film in series history, and was credited with killing the franchise. Until J.J. Abrams rebooted it six and a half years later.Most franchises in recent years have not taken that much time off in between installments including Twilight, Harry Potter, Iron Man, Transformers, and the Star Wars prequels. Even newer ones like Hobbit and Hunger Games have told fans that they will get a new chapter every year. Last year, however, there were a pair of films that came out exactly four years after their last installments and opened bigger without even needing 3D – The Dark Knight Rises and Skyfall. Both were threequels to a reboot and followed sequels that were also very successful so audiences were more hooked to the brands. The love shown for 2009’s Star Trek could have been somewhat of an anomaly. It certainly brought in a broader more mainstream crowd, but many may have lost the excitement this time around especially with popular alternative options from Mr. Stark and Mr. Gatsby out there right now.This is not the first time this year that Paramount has found itself in this situation. March’s G.I. Joe: Retaliation was the follow-up to the studio’s summer 2009 hit The Rise of Cobra and also had a 3D upgrade and a shift in opening day from Friday to Thursday with Wednesday night previews. The new pic (with added starpower) opened to $51M over 4.5 days which did not match up to the $54.7M three-day opening of the 2D Cobra. The sequel is on track to end with $122M, short of the first film’s $150.2M, but is seeing much better numbers from overseas markets.The road ahead will be tricky for Into Darkness. It is well-liked for the most part and it has the Memorial Day holiday weekend on its second frame. But the core adult male audience will be tempted away with two more big sequels opening at the end of this week – Fast &amp; Furious 6 and The Hangover Part III. Also sci-fi sequels tend to draw the bulk of their audiences upfront, even if word-of-mouth is very good.Overall, Into Darkness is not likely to match the $257.7M final domestic gross of the last Star Trek. However, it still has a shot at $200M if it can hold up relatively well next weekend. Budgeted at $190M, the Kirk-and-Spock sequel will definitely see substantial growth on the international side as several key overseas markets have become much more lucrative since 2009.This weekend, the new Trek launched in 33 international markets and grossed an estimated $40M from those plus seven holdover territories that bowed last week. Cume outside of North America is $80.5M with the global gross at $164.6M. Russia led the new markets with $8M (quadruple the opening of the last Trek) while the U.K. led the holdovers with a $5.9M weekend and $24M total. Half of the international marketplace has yet to open so plenty of potential is ahead with debuts scheduled in China (May 28), Korea (May 30), France (June 12), Italy (June 13), Brazil (June 14), Spain (July 5) and Japan (August 23).Dropping a notch down to second place was two-time chart-topper Iron Man 3 which pulled in an estimated $35.2M in its third weekend of release. The Disney title declined by 52% which was not bad considering it had such direct competition to face with Trek’s launch playing to the same adult male action crowd. Marvel’s hit 3D threequel has now soared to a domestic cume of $337.1M putting it at number 25 on the list of All-Time Domestic Blockbusters and passing the $336.5M of 2007’s Spider-Man 3. Iron Man 3 is still on a trajectory to break the $400M mark.Overseas, the latest Tony Stark smash remained a key contender collecting an estimated $40.2M, although sales dropped by more than half from last weekend. Iron Man 3’s international total climbed to $736.2M propelling the global gross to a towering $1.07 billion on its way to about $1.3 billion. Currently, it sits at number nine among all-time worldwide hits.The lavish Leonardo DiCaprio drama The Great Gatsby enjoyed another big weekend grossing an estimated $23.4M in third place. The 53% decline was quite respectable considering the weak word-of-mouth, negative reviews, and huge upfront turnout last weekend. After ten days, the Baz Luhrmann film has raked in $90.2M driven by adult women and is already the studio’s top-grossing film this year. No third place film has ever grossed this much money on the third weekend of May and Gatsby’s success may have chipped away at some of Star Trek’s potential. DiCaprio hardly ever does sexy heartthrob roles any more so this rare turn is pulling in audiences despite mixed buzz on the quality of the picture.Following its debut on Wednesday as the opening night film of the Cannes Film Festival, The Great Gatsby rolled out across international markets and grossed a strong $42.1M from nearly 8,400 screens in 49 territories. Leading the way was Russia with $6.2M followed closely by the U.K. with $6.1M. Major markets still to come include the director’s Australia (May 30), Mexico (May 31), Brazil (June 7), and Japan (June 14).The rest of the top ten was filled with leftovers that attracted small crowds with each grossing in the rough range of $1-3M. Paramount’s Pain &amp; Gain dropped 38% to an estimated $3.1M for a cume to date of $46.6M. In its ninth weekend of being the only toon game in town, The Croods slipped only 24% to an estimated $2.8M boosting Fox’s total to a robust $176.8M. The cavepeople comedy will finally face competition next weekend with the studio’s own release of the animated adventure Epic.The baseball drama 42 followed with an estimated $2.7M, off 41%, giving Warner Bros. a solid $88.7M. Universal’s sci-fi offering Oblivion fell 47% to an estimated $2.2M giving the Tom Cruise film $85.5M so far domestically. International sales are now up to $173M putting the global gross at $258.5M.Adding some more screens in its fourth weekend was the indie hit Mud which grossed an estimated $2.16M sliding only 15%. Roadside Attractions has collected $11.6M with the rural tale on its way to the vicinity of $20M. The Tyler Perry-produced flop Peeples tumbled 53% in its sophomore round to an estimated $2.15M and a weak $7.9M to date. Rounding out the top ten was another Lionsgate release The Big Wedding with an estimated $1.1M, down 56%, for a $20.2M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $145.3M which was up 9% from last year when The Avengers remained at number one with $55.6M; but down 7% from 2011 when Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides opened in the top spot with $90.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Christmas, Netflix, lord, who, star, films, Premium, Sundance, Awards, drama, streaming","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Star-Trek-Softer-Than-Expected-at-1"},{"id":"47509119429371","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Carell &amp; Sandler Sequels Rule Box Office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Carell &amp; Sandler Sequels Rule Box Officeby Gitesh Pandya | July 14, 2013 |  CommentsHumor was in demand as A-list funnymen Steve Carell and Adam Sandler dominated the box office with their hit sequels Despicable Me 2 and Grown Ups 2, respectively, while the raunchy laughs of The Heat with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy also finished among the top four movies for the frame. The big-budget sci-fi actioner Pacific Rim opened in third and helped lead another weekend when ticket sales were substantially ahead of last year’s.Staying at number one for a second weekend, Despicable Me 2 delivered a solid sophomore frame with an estimated $44.8M dropping only 46%. The toon smash has now amassed a staggering $229.2M and could be on its way to doing $350M or more from North America alone. By next weekend, it will surpass the $251.5M domestic total of its 2010 predecessor.The Minions continued to win over audiences around the world too. The international marketplace took in a hefty $55.5M from 50 markets boosting the offshore sum to $243.2M and the global tally to $472.4M and rising quickly. By midweek, the worldwide haul will crush the half-billion mark.Adam Sandler scored another box office hit, this time with his first-ever sequel, as the comedy Grown Ups 2 debuted close behind in second place with an estimated $42.5M. The Sony release averaged a sturdy $12,174 from 3,491 locations with no help from 3D. That edged out the $40.5M debut of its 2010 predecessor which went on to finish with $162M domestically. Grown Ups 2 tied last fall’s animated hit Hotel Transylvania for Sander’s second biggest opening weekend ever trailing only the $47.6M of 2005’s The Longest Yard.The funnyman’s live-action films since the first Grown Ups ranged from disappointing to pathetic at the box office indicating that fans may have tired of his brand of humor. But the sequel opened at the high end of Sandler’s usual first weekend range cementing his status as one of the most reliable box office draws in the business. He is well on his way to having his 14th $100M+ domestic grosser over the past 15 years.Grown Ups 2 – which also brought back Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Salma Hayek – skewed 53% female giving that audience a funny and light alternative to the macho action fare. 54% was under 25. Reviews were among the worst of the year which is usually the case with Sandler’s films. They don’t win over critics, but they do sell to mainstream moviegoers looking for light-hearted fun that requires no thinking. The CinemaScore grade was a mediocre B.Opening in third place was the sci-fi actioner Pacific Rim with an estimated $38.3M from 3,275 theaters for a good $11,695 average. That was about even with the $37.1M bow of April’s futuristic thriller Oblivion with Tom Cruise. Both were sci-fi action pics not based on known brands which also had 3D and IMAX contributing. Oblivion was star-driven but Pacific had a prime summer slot. District 9 from the summer of 2009 opened to a similar $37.4M.Ordinarily this would be a very strong opening for an original action film with no major box office stars. However, Pacific Rim carried an enormous budget, reportedly in the $200M range, so it will take a long road to reach break-even. Directed by Guillermo del Toro, Rim tells the story of a time in the near future when humans build humungous robots to do battle with alien monsters on a mission to exterminate Earth’s inhabitants.Reviews were very positive and the CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A- which was the same as for other summer action flicks like Man of Steel, White House Down, and The Heat. This might indicate a good road ahead, although fanboy pics typically draw their main audience upfront. Studio research showed that males made up 61% of the crowd while 53% were over 25. The special effects were a big draw as 19% of the gross came from IMAX screens and 50% overall came from the 3D format. That share represented the highest of any film in that format this summer.About half of the international marketplace opened Pacific Rim this weekend with $53M collected from 38 markets for a global debut of $91.3M. Most, but not all, markets were impressive led by $9.6M in Korea and $9.3M in Russia. More key markets are to come including France and Germany next weekend and China, which could be a huge one for an IMAX film like this, on July 31.Enjoying the best hold in the top ten was the Sandra Bullock-Melissa McCarthy comedy hit The Heat which grossed an estimated $14M in its third weekend, off 44%. The Fox release surged to $112.4M becoming the sixth live-action $100M+ domestic grosser for Bullock and third for McCarthy in a major role.Disney contributed the next two films. The mega-budgeted adventure The Lone Ranger tanked in its second frame with an estimated $11.1M falling a steep 62%. That was especially troubling considering that the opening day did not fall on the first frame’s Friday-to-Sunday take. The Johnny Depp misfire should end its domestic run just under the $100M mark. Overseas grosses are not exactly on fire. Only $48M has been collected so far from 33 markets representing a third of the overall foreign marketplace with the worldwide figure at just $119.1M. Additional major territories don’t open until August.Among suppliers, the studio is seeing much better results from Pixar than from Jerry Bruckheimer. The toon sequel Monsters University declined by 46% to an estimated $10.6M in its fourth round pushing the total to $237.8M. The global score has risen to $474.2M on its way to over $600M.Hunk-led disaster movies followed. Brad Pitt’s zombie thriller World War Z fell 49% to an estimated $9.4M while Channing Tatum’s White House Down dropped 54% to an estimated $6.2M. Totals are $177.1M for Paramount and $63M for Sony.Standup concert film Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain followed with an estimated $5M, off 50%, giving Lionsgate $26.4M to date. Rounding out the top ten was the superhero smash Man of Steel which tumbled 58% to an estimated $4.8M putting Warner Bros. at $281M thus far. A final in the $290-295M range should result.In the limited release scene, The Weinstein Co. attracted sensational business to its Sundance winner Fruitvale Station which bowed in just seven sites to an estimated $377,000 for a scorching $53,857 average. Reviews have been terrific and Oscar buzz is already growing. The Hindi film Bhaag Milkha Bhaag debuted to an estimated $670,000 from 139 theaters for a $4,820 average for distributor Reliance Entertainment. Indie comedy hit The Way, Way Back expanded from 19 to 79 locations and grossed an estimated $1.1M for a solid $14,051 average. With $1.9M to date, Fox Searchlight will expand to nearly 300 theaters on Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $186.7M which was up 25% from last year when Ice Age: Continental Drift opened at number one with $46.6M; but down 25% from 2011 when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 debuted in the top spot with a record $169.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, directors, Academy, psychological, comedy, TV, Plus","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Carell-and-Sandler-Sequels-Rule-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509117944567","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Elysium Tops Crowded List of Newcomers","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Elysium Tops Crowded List of Newcomersby RT Staff | August 12, 2013 |  CommentsNorth American multiplexes were hit with a traffic jam as four new wide releases took all the leading spots with the top ten beating out both last weekend’s and last year’s numbers. Leading the way with a number one debut was the sci-fi action thriller Elysium starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster which opened to $30.5M from 3,284 locations for a good $9,287 average. Considering the original story, R rating, and the fact that 14 other summer action films came before it, the debut was respectable though not stellar.The opening came in below the $37.4M of director Neill Blomkamp’s debut feature film District 9 which released around the same time on the calendar three years ago, but with no stars and a fraction of the production budget. That film won rave reviews, hot buzz out of Comic Con, and eventually an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. Sony acquired worldwide rights for Elysium for $115M. It’s been a tough summer for the studio with After Earth, White House Down, and The Smurfs 2 all underperforming. Comedies This is the End and Grown Ups 2 have done well though.The futuristic film lacked female appeal which held back some of its potential. Hollywood has bombarded summer audiences with 15 action titles since early May and this weekend a comedy like We’re the Millers proved to be a better option for many adult couples looking for a fun time at the movies. Studio research showed that a high 61% of the crowd was male and 52% was under 30. IMAX sales were solid, though.Despite generally positive reviews, paying audiences were not too jazzed by Elysium as the CinemaScore grade was only a B. That was the same grade earned earlier this summer by After Earth and The Hangover Part III which both fell by more than 60% in the second weekend. In fact, the only action film this summer to score a lower grade was the universally-panned R.I.P.D. with its C+. Among this year’s original sci-fi action pics, Elysium debuted below Oblivion and Pacific Rim which each opened to $37M and change. But those were both PG-13 so given the rating difference, it was not too much weaker. Since May, action films have generally been good, but not amazing. And amazing is what many moviegoers need in order to open their wallets at this point.Jennifer Aniston scored the seventh $25M+ opening of her career in a major role with the new comedy We’re the Millers which debuted strongly in second place with an estimated $26.6M over the weekend and a hefty $38M since its Wednesday launch. The Warner Bros. release averaged a potent $8,146 over three days from 3,260 locations. Critics slammed the R-rated comedy about a fake family trying to smuggle pot into the country from Mexico, however regular audiences felt differently. The CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A- as those looking for raunchy summer laughs that don’t require much thinking were satisfied with what they paid for.Millers benefited from solid cross-gender appeal as studio research showed that males made up 51% while the overall skew was towards mature adults with 61% being over 25. Aniston has been a bankable actress over the years and her starpower trumped the bad reviews as the film has no other star with a proven box office track record. Millers may just become the sixth $100M+ domestic grosser of her career, fifth among major roles.Landing in third with a respectable bow was Disney’s animated film Planes with an estimated $22.5M from 3,702 locations for a $6,085 average. It was the best opening among all the kidpics released since the juggernaut Despicable Me 2, but was not an especially impressive turnout. The PG-rated film was heavily marketed as being connected to Pixar’s Cars franchise even though it was made by filmmakers from the direct-to-DVD world. Planes earned an A- CinemaScore which is common for toons and had limited appeal beyond the core family crowd.Another new kidpic followed with a similar gross, though it needed five days to reach it. Fox’s fantasy sequel Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters debuted to an estimated $14.6M over the weekend and $23.5M since its Wednesday bow. The five-day debut was down a troubling 39% from the four-day holiday bow of its 2010 predecessor Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians. With weak reviews, a glut of mediocre titles for kids, and a moderate B+ CinemaScore grade, the PG-rated film did not attract huge sales. The effects-driven pic averaged only $4,817 from 3,031 theaters.Consistently bankable Denzel Washington suffered a drop that was larger than usual for his latest action pic 2 Guns which fell 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $11.1M. Incoming competition from the many new releases hurt all films but this Universal release also has seen audience buzz that was mediocre and not stellar. With $48.5M, look for 2 Guns to finish with about $75-80M. Fellow sophomore The Smurfs 2 declined by 46% to an estimated $9.5M and has given Sony a disappointing $46.6M after 12 days. The final tally might end at around $70M which would be half of what its 2011 predecessor made.Tumbling 63% to an estimated $8M was The Wolverine which has banked $112M so far for Fox. The spooky smash The Conjuring grossed an estimated $6.7M in its fourth weekend, down 49%, for a cume of $120.7M for Warner Bros.The latest hits from a pair of A-list funnymen rounded out the top ten. Steve Carell’s monster blockbuster Despicable Me 2 ranked ninth with an estimated $5.7M, off 44%, for a domestic haul of $338.3M. The Universal sensation also watched its international cume soar to $407.5M while the worldwide tally hit $745.8M. Breaking $800M will be simple as key markets like Russia, Korea, and Italy are still to open between now and October. Adam Sandler’s first sequel Grown Ups 2 fell 53% to an estimated $3.7M putting Sony at $123.8M to date.On the specialty scene, UTV’s action-comedy Chennai Express broke the record for the biggest Bollywood opening ever with an estimated $2.2M from 196 locations for a $11,352 average. Cume since the Thursday launch is $2.5M. Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine expanded well again with an estimated $2.5M from 119 sites for a $21,202 average and $6.2M sum for Sony Classics.The top ten films grossed an estimated $138.9M which was up 8% from last year when The Bourne Legacy debuted at number one with $38.1M; and up 3% from 2011 when Rise of the Planet of the Apes remained in the top spot with $27.8M.Follow Gitesh on the Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"screenings, Month","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Elysium-Tops-Crowded-List-of-Newcomers"},{"id":"47509117946616","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: 2 Guns Shoots Its Way to the Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: 2 Guns Shoots Its Way to the TopPlus, The Smurfs 2 stumbles into third.by Gitesh Pandya | August 4, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg seized the number one spot at the North American box office with their new action thriller 2 Guns, which opened to an estimated $27.4M. Universal’s seventh top spot debut of the year averaged a solid $9,045 from 3,025 locations and ended up in the mid-20s range where so many of Washington’s films have opened before. It was an impressive bow given that the film was rated R, was not part of a well-known brand, and arrived as the 14th action movie of the summer. Audiences have had a plethora of choices in this genre lately and no action movie has overperformed since World War Z in mid-June.Earning mixed reviews, 2 Guns played to a broad audience of older adults. Studio research showed that cross-gender appeal was substantial with females taking a slight edge at 51% while those over 25 made up a very high 77% of the audience. The CinemaScore grade was a mediocre B+ so buzz is not anything too special. The undercover cop pic cost $61M to produce.For Washington, 2 Guns delivered the fifth best opening of his career and now his top eight debuts are all for R-rated pictures. While he doesn’t do mega-budgeted tentpoles, the Oscar winner has been among the most bankable and reliable box office draws in the film industry over the last decade. In fact, over the last thirteen years, 14 of his 15 films have opened above $20M and none were sequels. 2003’s Out of Time was the sole exception with a $16.2M debut and this does not count his two directorial efforts which featured him in supporting roles. When Denzel Washington picks a project to star in, audiences know they will be entertained. This consistency is especially remarkable given that the actor turns 60 next year. Stars of this age rarely keep headlining hits.The superhero flick The Wolverine dropped down to second place in its sophomore session with an estimated $21.7M falling 59% in the process. The drop fell between the 61% suffered by 2011’s Captain America at the same point in the summer and the 56% of X-Men: First Class from early June that same season. All were based on Marvel characters. The decline was much smaller than the awful 69% tumble that the much-despised X-Men Origins: Wolverine had in May 2009. Hugh Jackman’s latest turn as the clawed mutant has collected $95M in its first ten days, putting it just below the $98M of First Class over the same span. Produced for $120M, look for The Wolverine to end its domestic run at about the $140M mark.Hollywood’s rocky summer saw another casualty of war open in third place. The kidpic sequel The Smurfs 2 debuted to an estimated $18.2M over the weekend and $27.8M since its Wednesday bow. Even the extended five-day launch came in below the three-day opening of the first Smurfs movie which was also in late July with $35.6M two years ago. Competition was a factor as the leggy Despicable Me 2 was still in eight-digit territory in its fifth weekend while the DreamWorks toon Turbo took away a bit of the family audience too. Parents and kids have had more than their fair share of movies this summer and more new choices are not in demand.Smurfs 2 earned an A- CinemaScore grade which is common for family flicks, however reviews were negative across the board. Insults from critics do not always affect the box office of these types of films, as evidenced by the Alvin and the Chipmunks trilogy, which grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide. Smurfette and her gang are counting on overseas markets to bring in the coin since the last Smurfs movie made a whopping $564M globally with 75% coming from international. The sequel fared better abroad this weekend with an estimated $52.5M from 43 territories for a global opening of $80.3M. Sony reported that the overseas bow was off just 4% from its predecessor with Russia and the U.K. leading the way this weekend with number one debuts of $5.4M and $5.1M respectively.The runaway blockbuster The Conjuring smashed the $100M mark this weekend and continued to hold up well with an estimated $13.7M in its third scare. Off 39%, the Warner Bros. release has now grossed an amazing $108.6M while costing only $20M to produce. The supernatural thriller has become that rare summer film that doesn’t need to rely on international success to become a moneymaker. A final gross of $140-150M is likely from North America alone for the crowdpleasing haunted house flick.Toon behemoth Despicable Me 2 became the first movie this summer to spend five weekends in the top five as it captured another $10.4M, according to estimates, declining by just 37%. The Universal smash’s amazing staying power has resulted in a gold mine for the studio, but competing kidpics over the past month have taken a beating at the multiplexes. The latest Gru pic has amassed a staggering $326.7M making it the year’s second biggest blockbuster in North America after Iron Man 3. The overseas gross surged to $387M putting the worldwide gross at a towering $713.7M on its way past $800M with Russia still to come.Adam Sandler’s latest nine-digit hit Grown Ups 2 followed with an estimated $8.1M in its fourth round, down only 30%, for a $116.4M cume for Sony. The original toon Turbo got hit hard by the arrival of Papa Smurf and company, falling 53% to an estimated $6.4M. The Fox release upped its sum to $69.5M and looks unlikely to reach the $100M mark.Dropping 40% to an estimated $5.7M was the action sequel Red 2 which has banked a not-so-impressive $45.2M to date for Lionsgate. Fox’s sleeper hit The Heat enjoyed another low decline slipping just 32% to an estimated $4.7M with a remarkable $149.6M overall. Rounding out the top ten was the sci-fi pic Pacific Rim with an estimated $4.6M, down 41%, giving Warner Bros. a $93M domestic cume. It also rocked China with a five-day opening of roughly $45M driven by 3D and IMAX success propelling the overseas cume past $200M and the global tally to $293.4M on its way to over $400M worldwide with some key markets still to come.Following its sensational platform bow in six locations last weekend, Woody Allen’s latest film Blue Jasmine enjoyed a good expansion to 50 theaters resulting in an estimated $2M frame for a potent $40,440 average. The Sony Classics cume stands at $3M with another round of cities to launch next weekend. Elsewhere on the indie scene, Fox Searchlight’s comedy The Way, Way Back slipped only 17% to an estimated $2.9M for a solid $13.7M total. The Weinstein Co. saw its Fruitvale Station drop 41% to an estimated $2.7M with $11M overall. Both films are playing in just over 1,000 theaters.With the final month of the summer movie season starting, studio offerings from mid-season are winding down their domestic runs. Current totals for recent big-budget offerings include $258.6M for Monsters University, $195.9M for World War Z, $86.7M for The Lone Ranger, and a lousy $30.4M for R.I.P.D.The top ten films grossed an estimated $120.8M which was up 8% from last year when The Dark Knight Rises remained at number one with $35.7M; but down 22% from 2011 when Rise of the Planet of the Apes opened in the top spot with $54.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"scene, Best, Black, awards, spain, Infographic, directors, the, Pictures, cars, nightmare, PlayStation, boxing, Golden, Christmas","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-2-Guns-Shoots-Its-Way-to-the-Top"},{"id":"47509119449858","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious Leads Record Memorial Day","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious Leads Record Memorial Dayby Gitesh Pandya | May 27, 2013 |  CommentsMoviegoers gorged themselves on high-profile sequels powering the North American box office to a record-breaking Memorial Day frame with the top ten films grossing over $250M during just the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the long weekend. The marketplace expanded to incredible levels making for one of the five biggest overall box office weekends ever.The busy frame was led by the high-octane opening of the action smash Fast &amp; Furious 6 which generated the best debut in its 12-year franchise history with an estimated $98.5M over the three-day portion of the holiday frame. Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Dwayne Johnson, the latest PG-13 installment averaged a muscular $26,927 from 3,658 theaters with no help from any 3D gimmickry. Universal is projecting an eye-popping four-day holiday opening of $122M.Since Diesel’s return to the popular series with 2009’s Fast &amp; Furious (the fourth pic), the opening weekends and final grosses have risen sharply with every new chapter. Producers know to add something new each time to keep customers interested. Instead of franchise fatigue, audiences have become even more excited and international audiences have been contributing more and more. The last film, Fast Five from April 2011, opened to $86.2M on its way to a $209.8M domestic final and $629M worldwide total – all franchise highs. Part 6 is now looking to beat all of those marks. The well-liked Five’s good will is paying dividends now.Three of the four biggest opening weekends in company history for Universal are from the last three Fast installments. So not only is this a critical franchise for the studio, it’s also one that is still growing bigger which bodes well for the years to come.From day one in June 2001, the series has invested in ethnically diverse casts which has broadened the consumer base. Sales from urban youth have always been key. And appeal has been strong with women too. This weekend’s audience breakdown showed a 49% female crowd which is incredibly high for a macho action sequel. 57% were age 25 or older and 32% were Latino. Reviews were generally good and the CinemaScore grade for the $160M budgeted film was a solid A. The ending of the sixquel even sets up the new cast addition for part 7 which is already slated to open on July 11 next summer.Overseas, Furious grossed a whopping $158M this weekend from 59 markets upping the cume to $177M including the U.K. which opened strong a week earlier. Worldwide is $275.5M and rising rapidly with many new franchise records being set. Australia is still to open in June followed by China and Japan in July. By the end of this week, the franchise six-pack will race past the $2 billion cumulative mark.Suffering the opposite franchise trajectory was The Hangover Part III which opened in second place with an estimated $42.5M over the Friday-to-Sunday period which was half of what its predecessor did over the same holiday weekend two years ago. Both sequels opened on the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend although III was moved from a Friday release just recently so not all fans knew it was available earlier. The new chapter grossed $54.2M from Thursday-to-Sunday, down 54% from II. Though a huge commercial blockbuster, the second part was widely criticized by audiences as being a lazy copy of the first film’s plot and that prompted many to lose interest in a third entry.Over three days, the Hangover finale averaged $11,931 from 3,555 locations. Part II was powered by the good will of the first Hangover pic from the summer of 2009 and bowed to a stellar $135M over five days. Part III may not even reach that amount by the end of its run. The 2011 film went on its way to $254.5M domestically and $581.5M worldwide. Reviews were once again negative on the latest sequel and audiences gave a lukewarm B grade from CinemaScore. Overseas, Part III opened at number one in three markets – the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand – grossing $19.2M. Unlike domestic, most international markets will get a one week gap between the Hangover and Furious sequels with over 50 territories launching Part III next weekend.Star Trek Into Darkness fell from its number one spot but held up well in its sophomore frame given the intense competition. The Friday-to-Sunday gross dropped 46% to an estimated $38M pushing the cume up to $146.8M. After opening below expectations, the Paramount release is benefiting from good word-of-mouth with a decline that was commendable for a sci-fi sequel. The domestic gross now has a chance of ending up in the vicinity of $225M (helped by 3D) which would be not far from the $257.7M of its predecessor. International rose to $102.1M and the worldwide take stands at $248.9M with major markets China and Korea to open next weekend. Those are the two highest-grossing overseas markets for another effects-heavy May actioner, Iron Man 3.The animated adventure Epic did not fail and scored with family audiences opening to an estimated $34.2M from 3,882 theaters for a $8,810 average. The PG-rated film had young kids all to itself and is expected to pull in about $44M over the four-day holiday span. Studios have not been serving up enough options for families this year as Epic is the first animated film since March’s The Croods which is now in its tenth weekend of release, and still in the top ten. Both were released by Fox. Reviews were generally good for the leaf people pic and the A CinemaScore grade bodes well for the road ahead especially since the next kidpic doesn’t arrive until June 21 with Pixar’s Monsters University. Epic opened in 20 new international markets this weekend with $23.1M lifting the overseas cume to $44M and the early global take to $78.2M with 26 additional territories launching next weekend.Dropping 46% to fifth place was the year’s biggest hit Iron Man 3 which pulled in an estimated $19.4M in its fourth weekend. The Marvel smash upped its cume to $367.5M putting it at number 22 on the list of All-Time Domestic Blockbusters right behind the $373.4M of 2004’s Spider-Man 2. Disney’s megahit is now the fifth biggest global blockbuster of all-time with a jaw-dropping $1.14 billion, 68% from international markets.Leonardo DiCaprio scored the eighth $100M blockbuster of his career with The Great Gatsby which ranked sixth. The Warner Bros. pic grossed an estimated $13.7M, down 43%, giving the lavish film a solid $114.4M to date. Despite weak reviews and a lackluster audience score, Gatsby has been holding up well against all the competition in part due to an audience of mature women not as interested in the other major offerings. The global gross hit $200M this weekend.The rest of the top ten featured films taking in small morsels. Indie hit Mud eased just 14% to an estimated $1.9M while losing some screens. The Roadside Attractions release has grossed $14.5M to date. Warner Bros. saw its baseball hit 42 take in an estimated $1.2M, off 56%, for a $91M cume.With families flocking to a new toon, The Croods tumbled 60% to an estimated $1.2M making for a total of $179.6M for Fox. The Tom Cruise sci-fi drama Oblivion took in an estimated $815,000, down 65%, with a total tally of $87.3M for Universal. Worldwide sums are $565.6M and $266.8M, respectively.The Ethan Hawke-Julie Delpy indie drama Before Midnight platformed to sensational results thanks to a built-in audience and stellar reviews. Sony Classics opened the pic in New York, Los Angeles, and Austin and grossed an estimated $274,000 from only five locations for a sizzling $54,800 average. Midnight expands out to about 30 total theaters next weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $251.4M over the Friday-to-Sunday span which was up a stunning 90% from last year when Men in Black 3 opened at number one with $54.6M; and up 18% from 2011’s record holiday when The Hangover Part II debuted in the top spot with $85.9M.Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up — follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Box, VICE, Fox, TCA, indie, shows, Trailer, saw, batman, Hulu, spanish, Amazon, adventure, Paramount","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Furious-Leads-Record-Memorial-Day"},{"id":"47509121142539","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Croods, Olympus Drive March Madness","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Croods, Olympus Drive March Madnessby Gitesh Pandya | March 24, 2013 |  CommentsThe North American box office enjoyed a spring surge as two new films both scored terrific debuts bringing in business from different audiences. Families led the way driving the animated comedy The Croods to the top spot while the violent action thriller Olympus Has Fallen opened with authority in second place with better than expected results. Add in hot holdover Oz the Great and Powerful and it was a rare March weekend that saw three films gross north of $20M a piece.DreamWorks Animation, and new distribution partner Fox, had much to celebrate as The Croods bowed at number one with an estimated $44.7M. That was on par with recent March non-sequel toons like How to Train Your Dragon ($43.7M in 2010), Rio ($39.2M in 2011), and the 2D Horton Hears a Who ($45M in 2008) and much better than the performance of the last effort from DreamWorks Rise of the Guardians. That holiday season offering debuted to $23.8M over three days and $32.3M across five days over last Thanksgiving’s holiday frame. Reaching $103.2M total from North America, it caused concern over whether the powerhouse animation factory was losing its touch and producing too much content. The studio has now had three 3D toons over the last nine months.Croods didn’t have an A-list voice actor like Steve Carell or Jim Carrey from Horton and was not part of a top brand with a built-in audience like last year’s The Lorax so the performance was encouraging. Plus the road ahead looks bright for a number of reasons. Easter holidays will give children plenty of time off over the coming two weeks so the target audience will be very available – not only on the weekends but during weekdays too. Croods earned a great A grade from CinemaScore meaning consumers are liking the entertainment on screen so word-of-mouth should be good. Plus, there are no other big-ticket options for kids opening for the rest of March and April so the cavepeople flick will have its audience to itself for a while. Expect good legs here as reaching $170M domestic is possible.Featuring the voices of Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, and Ryan Reynolds, the PG-rated toon averaged a sturdy $11,048 from 4,046 theaters. Friday kicked off with $11.6M, Saturday surged an impressive 63% to $18.9M, and the studio is estimating a 25% dip to $14.2M on Sunday. The weekend gross ended up in the middle of the same $40-50M neighborhood as the top toons from the last nine months like Hotel Transylvania ($42.5M), Ice Age: Continental Drift ($46.6M), and Wreck-it Ralph ($49M).DreamWorks will be hoping for the kind of legs witnessed by its March 2010 hit Dragon which was seen as a disappointment after its first weekend but then went on to show amazing longevity that resulted in a final domestic take of $217.6M, five times its opening. Croods and Dragon both earned the same grade from CinemaScore, though critics were much more impressed by the latter. Reviews were good for Croods, but not glowing. 3D screens accounted for 38% of the gross, up slightly from the 35% for Guardians. Females made up 57% of the audience while 55% was 25 and older.Worldwide, Croods raked in a towering $108M with $63.3M (including previews) coming from 47 international markets representing 60% of the overseas marketplace. Russia, a red hot market for Hollywood animation, led the way with a superb $12.9M start (74% from 3D screens) followed by Mexico’s $9.5M and the United Kingdom’s $8.3M. The prehistoric family was number one in 44 of those markets this weekend and will open in 19 additional territories next weekend for Easter. With school holidays coming up around the world, and overseas audiences more willing to pay 3D surcharges, the long-term outlook is incredibly promising.Gerard Butler scored his first hit in three years with the presidential kidnapping thriller Olympus Has Fallen which opened in second place with a muscular $30.5M, according to estimates. The R-rated action film about the White House being seized by North Korean terrorists averaged a stellar $9,845 from 3,098 locations and delivered the actor’s second biggest debut ever after the $70.9M of his career-making role in 300. Olympus also gave distributor FilmDistrict its best opening ever.In a year when action films have been underperforming in almost every case, Olympus generated genuine audience excitement and brought out ticket buyers. Reviews were mixed and didn’t help much. Audiences responded instead to the intriguing concept, effective marketing materials, and starpower with Butler back into a gritty hero role joined by Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, and Aaron Eckhart. A dose of patriotism added to the success too. Those polled by CinemaScore liked what they paid for as the grade was an encouraging A-.Adult men made up the largest demographic group for Olympus. Studio data showed that 53% was male and 73% was over 25. The opening weekend was especially impressive considering that the action film had to compete with the start of the NCAA college basketball tournament which has been attracting strong ratings everyday all weekend long.Following its two-week reign atop the charts, the megahit Oz the Great and Powerful dropped down to third place but still posted a solid showing with an estimated $22M in business. The Disney smash declined by 47% which was not bad considering all the competition that entered the marketplace this weekend. With $177.6M to date, Oz has captured an additional $178.8M overseas for a potent $356.4M global gross to date with sales split evenly between North America and the rest of the world for this very American story.The kidnapping thriller The Call ranked fifth dropping 49% to an estimated $8.7M for Sony. Halle Berry’s hit film has banked an impressive $30.9M in ten days and could finish with roughly $50M.Moviegoers had little interest in the new comedy from Tina Fey and Paul Rudd, Admission, which debuted to soft results in fifth with an estimated $6.4M. The Focus release averaged a weak $2,984 from 2,160 locations and was hurt by bad reviews which Fey’s more upscale fan base pays attention to. A dull B- CinemaScore indicates a rocky road ahead. Rudd has also struggled at the box office with his film Wanderlust with Jennifer Aniston flopping last spring with a puny $6.5M debut. With bigger options all doing well with adult women right now, Admission faced intense competition and failed to stand out as a must-see film.After a scorching hot platform debut last weekend, Spring Breakers expanded nationwide and landed in the top ten but saw sales slump to just passable levels. The Selena Gomez-Vanessa Hudgens pic grossed an estimated $5M from 1,104 theaters for a lukewarm $4,529 average. Co-starring James Franco – who has two films in the top ten this weekend with Oz seeing much more cash – the R-rated drama has collected $5.4M for distributor A24 and has earned good reviews.Tumbling a troubling 58% in its second weekend, the comedy flop The Incredible Burt Wonderstone grossed an estimated $4.3M for a weak ten-day tally of $17.4M. The Warner Bros. release should end up with a disappointing $25M or so. The studio’s big-budget fairy tale adventure Jack the Giant Slayer also fell sharply dropping 53% to an estimated $3M for only $59.1M to date.The hit comedy Identity Thief followed with an estimated $2.5M, off 43%, for a $128M cume to date. Dwayne Johnson’s first of many 2013 releases Snitch rounded out the top ten falling 45% to an estimated $1.9M and a nice sum of $40.3M for Lionsgate. The wrestler-turned-action-star is now on week five of what could turn out to be a 20-week consecutive streak in the top ten. Next up, G.I. Joe Retaliation attacking over 3,500 theaters Thursday with the first shows at 7:00pm this Wednesday.Some solid debuts occurred in the specialty marketplace. The critically-acclaimed Australian girl-group pic The Sapphires debuted in four locations with an estimated $41,000 for a $10,232 average. The Weinstein Co. will roll out the PG-13 film into more markets this spring. Also getting raves from critics, My Brother the Devil bowed to an estimated $12,000 from a pair of New York sites for a $6,070 average. Released by Paladin and 108 Media, the Sundance award winner expands next to Los Angeles on April 5.The top ten films grossed an estimated $129M which was down 36% from last year when The Hunger Games opened at number one with a record $152.5M; but up 23% from 2011 when Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules debuted in the top spot with $23.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Mudbound, italian, Wars","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Croods-Olympus-Drive-March-Madness"},{"id":"47509119456005","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Iron Man 3 Soars Above the Rest","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Iron Man 3 Soars Above the RestTony Stark and company have one of the biggest opening weekends in history.by Gitesh Pandya | May 5, 2013 |  CommentsTony Stark obliterated the competition as the much-anticipated super hero sequel Iron Man 3 generated the second biggest opening weekend in box office history and also became the top-grossing global blockbuster of 2013. Domestic audiences spent a jaw-dropping $175.3M this weekend, according to estimates, seeing the third installment in the Marvel franchise including grosses from Thursday night shows starting at 9:00pm. Playing in 4,253 theaters, the PG-13 actioner averaged a scorching $41,218 per location and was helped by surcharges for the 3D conversion.9% of the weekend gross ($16.5M) came from the 326 higher-priced IMAX screens. Overall, 45% of the frame came from 3D screens representing a drop from The Avengers which was 52% a year ago this same weekend. That Marvel assembly of super heroes still holds the all-time record for opening weekend with a staggering $207.4M putting Robert Downey Jr. in the two biggest debuts in industry history. Both films were released by Disney on the first weekend of May kicking off the summer movie season against zero competition.Iron Man 3‘s gargantuan run started off with $15.6M in Thursday night shows from 9:00pm into the post-midnight hours. The full opening day gross (including all Thursday night business) was $68.3M. That stands as the eighth best opening day ever. The real magic for the Stark-vs-Mandarin pic came on Saturday when the film declined by only 9% to $62.2M. By comparison, last year Avengers witnessed a larger 14% dip on Saturday coming off of a Friday gross that did not include Thursday night business starting so early. Iron Man 2‘s Saturday drop was 11%.With threequels usually eroding faster than their predecessors – especially when release weekends are identical – it was extraordinary that Iron Man 3 held up so well in its second day. Disney projected that Sunday would drop by 28% to $44.8M. Sunday falls for Avengers and Iron Man 2 were 18% and 32%, respectively.Iron Man 2 was seen as disappointing creatively by many fans and normally that would have prompted some of the audience to skip out on another chapter in the series. However, Avengers was so well-liked that it erased that bad taste and even expanded the overall fan base which Iron Man 3 capitalized on this weekend. Word of mouth is good so far as the CinemaScore grade was an A and also reviews have been fairly positive. Avengers scored higher in both categories, however for a threequel to earn these marks is terrific and bodes well for the weeks ahead. The next big action tentpole is Star Trek Into Darkness opening on IMAX on May 15 and in conventional theaters on Thursday May 16 so Iron Man 3 has a good week and a half of clear sailing to soar past the $200M and $300M marks. Even if it plays out with the same declines as Iron Man 2, it would break $400M as well by the end of the domestic run.The new blockbuster was once again anchored by superstar Robert Downey Jr. who can now claim to be the only movie star with $500M+ global blockbusters over the last six consecutive years. This comes from three Iron Man films, two Sherlock Holmes movies, and of course Avengers. Once hitting rock bottom in his career, the acclaimed actor has used his immense skills to turn things around and make himself into the world’s top box office draw.Audience breakdown for Iron Man 3 was identical to Avengers when it came to gender – 61% male. But the new Stark movie played a little older with 55% being over 25 compared to 50% for the super hero value pack. As for the entire marketplace, with Iron Man 3 absorbing all the free screens within each multiplex it accounted for a whopping 80% of the entire box office this weekend with no other wide releases daring to open and no holdover hitting double digit millions. Iron Man completely dominated the marketplace. Avengers commanded the exact same share of the box office one year ago this weekend when it crushed its foes.This is the seventh consecutive year that Marvel seized control over the lucrative first weekend in May to kickoff the summer movie season. Though its characters have done it before, the current streak started in 2007 with Sony’s Spider-Man 3 continuing with 2008’s Iron Man, 2009’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine, 2010’s Iron Man 2, 2011’s Thor, and Avengers last year. The comic giant has no intention of giving up this prime piece of box office real estate and has already planted its flag on May 2 next year with Sony’s The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as well as May 1, 2015 for The Avengers 2 which could conceivably score an opening weekend that breaks the $250M mark. They are essentially telling every other film to backoff. And it would surprise nobody if Marvel and Disney claim May 6, 2016 for a fourth Iron Man film. But next up are super sequels with Thor returning this November and Captain America next April.Iron Man 3 was also a colossal behemoth at the overseas box office this weekend where it played in its second round in most territories. The Marvel hero grossed a stellar $175.9M driven by new openings in China ($63.5M in 5 days), Russia ($21.7M in 4), and Germany ($10M in 5). That boosted the international total to a mammoth $504.8M and the global haul to a jaw-dropping $680.1M in under two weeks. That’s even more than the $655M that Avengers grossed in the same 12 days last year. Release dates were mostly the same as it too opened in most overseas markets one week before domestic to capitalize on the May Day holiday which is not celebrated in the U.S. The main difference is that Iron Man 3 opened in China three days earlier. With local partner DMG involved in producing the film, extra footage for a special version only for Chinese audiences, and Chinese stars added in, the results were record-breaking for Iron Man 3 in that market where it smashed the all-time opening day record on Wednesday with an estimated $21.5M.Trailing lucrative China, the next best results for Iron Man 3 came from two-week cumes in Korea ($42.6M), the U.K. ($38.3M), Mexico ($35.8M), Brazil ($30.1M), Australia ($28.4M), France ($27.8M), and Russia’s $21.7M from just the opening weekend. With nearly two weeks of clear sailing in most offshore markets (Star Trek Into Darkness debuts in six markets next weekend plus previews in others), Iron Man 3 could very well be on a trajectory towards the $1.3 billion mark in worldwide box office.The rest of the top ten featured scraps of spring leftovers fighting over what was left of the box office pie. The Mark Wahlberg-Dwayne Johnson action-comedy Pain &amp; Gain tumbled from the number one spot and lost 63% of its business. Paramount grossed an estimated $7.6M putting the ten-day take at $33.9M. Produced for a reported $26M, the Michael Bay film should end its domestic run with about $45M.The baseball drama 42 held up well dipping 42% to an estimated $6.2M giving Warner Bros. $78.3M to date. Tom Cruise’s sci-fi adventure Oblivion followed with an estimated $5.8M, down 67%, for a $76M domestic total to date for Universal. Hit toon The Croods eased by just 37% to an estimated $4.2M and upped its cume to $168.7M.Dropping 49% was the critically-panned Lionsgate title The Big Wedding with an estimated $3.9M for a lousy $14.2M cume in ten days. Matthew McConaughey’s new film Mud jumped into the top ten in its second weekend of moderate play with an estimated $2.2M from 576 locations for a mild $3,733 per theater. Roadside Attractions added 213 new sites boosting the theater count by 59% following its eleventh place debut last week. The weekend dip in grosses was only 3% and the cume is $5.2M.Also making about as much this weekend as last time was the year’s top domestic blockbuster (for now) Oz the Great and Powerful with an estimated $1.8M, even with last weekend. Disney coupled the fantasy adventure with Iron Man 3 for many drive-in double features nationwide and got to loot some extra cash off of Tony Stark’s popularity. The studio did the same thing with John Carter and The Avengers a year ago. Oz has now banked $228.6M from North America and $485.6M worldwide.Crashing 58% was the spoof sequel Scary Movie 5 with an estimated $1.4M giving The Weinstein Co. $29.6M to date. The Focus title The Place Beyond The Pines rounded out the top ten with an estimated $1.3M, down 52%, for a $18.7M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $209.7M which was down 15% from last year when The Avengers debuted at number one with a record $207.4M; but up 37% from 2011 when Thor opened in the top spot with $65.7M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"composers, streaming, Summer, kong, reviews, History, Fall, harry","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Iron-Man-3-Soars-Above-the-Rest"},{"id":"47509121143564","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Oz Powerful, Burt Not-So-Incredible","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Oz Powerful, Burt Not-So-Incredibleby Gitesh Pandya | March 17, 2013 |  CommentsMoviegoers cared about only one magician as the blockbuster Oz the Great and Powerful easily led the North American box office for a second time while dueling magic men Steve Carell and Jim Carrey saw their new comedy The Incredible Burt Wonderstone get flat out rejected. Meanwhile, the Halle Berry thriller The Call overperformed and enjoyed a solid second place debut.Disney’s big-budget Wizard of Oz prequel Oz was both great and powerful grossing an estimated $42.2M in its sophomore frame to boost the ten-day cume to $145M. The PG-rated witchfest dropped a moderate 47% which was in line with Johnny Depp’s 3D fairy tale extravaganza Alice in Wonderland from three years ago which declined by 46% in its second weekend which was also in mid-March. That film amassed $209.3M in its first ten days, or 63% of its eventual $334.2M domestic final. Neither Oz nor Alice had a new competing kidpic open on that sophomore session.Overseas, Oz hauled in another $46.6M from 55 territories boosting the international total to $136.8M and the global gross to $281.8M. With audiences generally liking the costly $215M-budgeted fantasy film, the current trajectory puts it on course for $230M-240M from North America and over $550M worldwide.Halle Berry scored a big hit this weekend with her new kidnapping thriller The Call which exceeded expectations and landed in second place with a $17.1M opening, according to estimates. The R-rated film which finds the Oscar-winning actress playing a 911 operator who takes matters into her own hands to capture a serial killer averaged a sturdy $6,821 from 2,507 locations powered by a female audience. Studio data showed that women made up 61% of the crowd while 53% were over 30. Abigail Breslin co-starred.Reviews were lackluster but moviegoers responded to the marketing push of this crime thriller. Berry has had little luck at the box office in recent years when not starring in a franchise film with built-in audiences. In fact, The Call delivered her third best opening ever for a non-franchise pic trailing only 2001’s Swordfish and 2003’s Gothika. The B+ CinemaScore indicates that audiences were generally pleased with what the Sony film had to offer so the long-term outlook seems promising. As an action hero, Berry can now say that she beat out openings this year from The Rock, Mark Wahlberg, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, and Colin Farrell.Barely breaking double digit millions, the all-star comedy The Incredible Burt Wonderstone opened to dismal results in third place with an estimated $10.3M for A-list comic stars Steve Carell and Jim Carrey. The PG-13 flick about an iconic Las Vegas magician threatened by the success of a popular new street performer featured two of the biggest box office names in the world of comedy but failed to excite ticket buyers. Burt averaged a middling $3,261 from 3,160 locations and boasted a cast that also included Steve Buscemi, James Gandolfini, Alan Arkin and Olivia Wilde.Critics slammed the Warner Bros. release and unfunny trailers and TV spots did little to change people’s minds. Over the past decade, Carell has anchored many broad comedy hits while Carrey has done very few spending more time instead on big kidpics and smaller indies. Among wide releases bowing in 2,000+ theaters, Wonderstone was the worst opener ever for Carell and the third lowest for Carrey after the Majestic and Man in the Moon. Studio research showed that Burt skewed 55% male and 56% over 25. CinemaScore audiences gave a disappointing C+ grade indicating a fast fade ahead.With nothing new for kids, the fairy tale adventure Jack the Giant Slayer held up well in its third round with an estimated $6.2M dipping 37%. The pricey Warner Bros. title has still only collected $53.9M from North America on its way to about $70M. Identity Thief, a hit with a much lower cost and much higher gross, followed in fifth place with an estimated $4.5M. Off just 29%, the Universal smash has grossed a terrific $123.7M to date.Dwayne Johnson’s Snitch has been that rare action movie with good legs slipping 31% in its fourth round to an estimated $3.5M for a $37.3M cume to date for Lionsgate. Relativity’s party comedy 21 and Over fell 49% to an estimated $2.6M with $21.9M overall.Oscar contender Silver Linings Playbook dropped 29% to an estimated $2.6M for The Weinstein Co. lifting the total to a sturdy $124.6M. Its been in the top ten for the past nine weekends. The Relativity romance Safe Haven followed close behind with an estimated $2.5M, off 34%, putting the tearjerker at a solid $67M. Rounding out the top ten was the kidpic Escape From Planet Earth which dipped only 28% to an estimated $2.3M. The total stands at $52.2M for The Weinstein Co.Making a spectacular splash in platform release was the bikini-clad-girls-with-guns pic Spring Breakers which sold out shows with an estimated $270,000 from only three theaters (2 in New York, 1 in Los Angeles) for a jaw-dropping $90,000 average. Distributed by A24, the R-rated film stars Disney Channel gals Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens in more sexually provocative roles along with James Franco who this weekend ruled both the mainstream and specialty scenes. Reviews were generally positive and Breakers will expand nationwide this Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $93.9M which was even with last year when 21 Jump Street opened at number one with $36.3M; but off 5% from 2011 when Limitless debuted in the top spot with $18.9M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"ITV, Poppins, cancelled, talk, Sabrina, 2017, composers, Vudu, See","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Oz-Powerful-Burt-NotSoIncredible"},{"id":"47509121140490","title":"Box Office Guru: G.I.

Joe Rocks Easter Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | April 1, 2013 |  CommentsTestosterone ruled the Easter frame as the 3D action sequel G.I. Joe: Retaliation opened at number one, but Tyler Perry’s latest offering Temptation also scored a strong debut of its own in third place. The animated holdover The Croods held up well in its second weekend pulling in families over the school holiday helping the box office beat Easter business from the past two years.Paramount topped the charts with the franchise hit G.I. Joe which debuted to an estimated $41.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and $51.7M since its launch on Wednesday night with 7:00pm shows. The PG-13 flick averaged a muscular $11,078 from 3,719 locations over the three-day weekend period with 45% of the business coming from 3D screens including 303 IMAX sites which kicked in $4.8M.Though definitely a strong opening, the 4.5-day figure still came in below the $54.7M three-day non-holiday opening of its 2009 predecessor G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. The first pic was released over the busier summer period in 4,000+ locations but the sequel had higher 3D prices and added starpower from Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis. Channing Tatum, who played a central role in the first film, had a more supporting role in the followup which was delayed from its original June 29, 2012 date.But Retaliation should still be a big moneymaker thanks to a smaller production budget ($130M vs $175M) and substantial growth from international markets which should more than make up for domestic shortfalls allowing the new film to finish higher than Cobra’s $302M global final.Domestically, the bullet-filled action pic skewed heavily male as expected. Studio research showed that males made up 68% of the crowd while 59% were 25 or older. Reviews were weak – standard for these types of sequels – but audiences liked what they paid for as the CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A-.Joe kicked off its run with $10.5M on Thursday, including $2.2M from Wednesday night shows. The Good Friday holiday saw sales climb 48% to $15.5M, Saturday was flat with $15.6M, and Easter Sunday is estimated to dip by 35% to $10.1M. Action sequels like these tend to be front-loaded but the domestic final should be able to break $100M and possibly end near the $110M mark. Cobra grossed $150.2M.Retaliation really saw its good fortune from overseas markets which generated an estimated $80.3M debut resulting in a spectacular global opening of $132M this weekend. Compared to the same markets for Cobra, Retaliation’s opening was nearly twice as big thanks in part to 3D prices and key markets becoming more lucrative since 2009. Russia led the way with $11M, Korea banked $6M, and Mexico scored $6M. The new Joe still has 25% of the world to come including China on April 15 and Japan on June 8 so a worldwide haul of $400M is possible.Families flocked to the animated comedy The Croods over the Easter school holidays as the DreamWorks pic grossed an estimated $26.5M, sliding 39% in its second weekend. Compared to other spring toons with the bunny holiday helping the sophomore frame, the pre-historic family dropped a little harder than 2011’s Rio (33%) and 2010’s How To Train Your Dragon (34%), but fell a little less than 2008’s Horton Hears a Who (45%).With a sturdy $88.6M in ten days, Croods should be able to keep its momentum going for weeks to come since there are absolutely no kidpics with G or PG ratings opening for nearly two months. A final domestic tally of about $160M could result making it the best performance for a DreamWorks Animation non-sequel since Dragon. Overseas, Croods used the holiday to bank a sizable $52.5M from 59 markets shooting the international total to $230M. Global is $296.6M and will smash $300M on Monday.The Tyler Perry brand showed off its strength and durability with the impressive debut of the infidelity drama Temptation which opened to an estimated $22.3M from 2,047 theaters for a stellar $10,894 average. That was almost identical to G.I. Joe’s average. Rated PG-13, Temptation delivered the best opening ever for a Perry film that wasn’t a sequel or featured his signature Madea character. Plus it was the tenth Tyler Perry film (ninth as director) over eight years to debut north of $20M. Despite having so much content, the filmmaker’s fans continue to come out and spend on his new offerings.Temptation was positioned a bit more as an erotic thriller which made it look like something a bit different. The audience breakdown was similar to past films from the mogul – 70% female and 79% 25 and older. Easter has been used successfully many times in the past to launch new Perry films and it worked for Lionsgate yet again as the fan base came out in better than expected numbers. The gross even doubled the opening of last fall’s Alex Cross which featured Perry as just an actor and in the title role. The CinemaScore was an A- and Perry’s fourteen films over the past eight years have now grossed a stunning $696M domestically with all carrying modest budgets.The White House kidnapping thriller Olympus Has Fallen dropped a large 54% thanks in part to a new action tentpole hitting the marketplace. Gerard Butler’s hit film grossed an estimated $14M raising the ten-day total to a sturdy $54.7M for FilmDistrct heading to an impressive final in the $85M vicinity. Flirting with the double century mark, Disney’s Oz the Great and Powerful took in an estimated $11.6M on Easter weekend, down 46%, for a $198.3M domestic total. Thanks to a new opening in China (official figures not yet released, but estimated to be near $10M over three days), the franchise flick grossed an estimated $22.2M from overseas markets boosting the international cume to $214M and the worldwide haul to $412.3M on its way to the $500M mark.The critically-panned sci-fi romance The Host failed to pull in business from Twilight fans and finished outside the top five in sixth place with an estimated $11M. Averaging a dull $3,436 from an aggressive release in 3,202 locations, the PG-13 pic was based on the best-selling book by author Stephenie Meyer which followed her mega-successful vampire saga. Critics trashed the Open Road release and fans decided to skip this one. The target audience consisted of young females and its B- CinemaScore indicated not much satisfaction from those ticket buyers that did come out.The Halle Berry hit The Call dropped 46% to an estimated $4.8M giving Sony $39.5M to date. Tina Fey followed with a similar 47% decline for her new comedy Admission which grossed an estimated $3.3M putting Focus at a disappointing $11.8M.The bikini-girls-with-guns pic Spring Breakers ranked ninth with an estimated $2.8M, off 43%, and a modest $10.1M overall for A24. Tumbling 70% in its third round was the all-star comedy flop The Incredible Burt Wonderstone which collected an estimated $1.3M. Warner Bros. has taken in a weak $20.6M and won’t finish with much more.After being MIA for a year and a half, red hot actor Ryan Gosling returned to the big screen in the platform release The Place Beyond The Pines along with co-star Bradley Cooper and found sensational results with an estimated $270,000 opening from just four theaters for a scorching $67,546 average. Focus will expand beyond New York and Los Angeles next weekend with 13 additional markets and will go nationwide on April 12. The R-rated drama earned good reviews from critics.The top ten films grossed an estimated $138.7M which was up 20% from last year’s Easter frame when The Hunger Games stayed at number one for a third time with $33.1M; and up 21% from 2011’s holiday when Rio remained in the top spot with $26.3M in its sophomore session.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Amazon, parents, kong, Netflix, Crunchyroll, nightmare, Interview, competition, scary, psychological","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-GI-Joe-Rocks-Easter-Weekend"},{"id":"47509121153809","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Identity Thief Scores Big in Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Identity Thief Scores Big in DebutWarm Bodies slids into second, and Soderbergh's final film nabs third.by Sujit Chawla | February 10, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, Universal’s Identity Thief blew onto the scene with a surprisingly strong opening, while Steven Soderbergh’s supposed last directorial effort debuted mildly in third. Returning films held on reasonably well, especially those of the Oscar variety.Exploding into first place was Identity Thief, starring Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy, with an estimated $36.6M from 3,141 theaters, for a potent per-screen average of $11,650. Despite the controversial review of formerly influential critic Rex Reed, audiences dug the film, which outgunned the opening weekends of Bateman’s Horrible Bosses ($28.3M) and McCarthy’s Bridesmaids ($26.2), both from the summer of 2011. Instead Identity Thief opened in line with last year’s spring hit 21 Jump Street which debuted with $36.3M on its way to $138.7M. If last year was the year of Tatum, could this year be the year of McCarthy, who has The Heat co-starring Sandra Bullock on tap for later this summer.Second place belonged to the warm and fuzzy zombies of Warm Bodies. Dipping a reasonable 43% from its debut weekend, the Summit release ate up an estimated $11.5M bringing its cume to $35.5M.Third place belonged to Side Effects directed by Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh, who claims this will be his last film. The thriller, which stars last year’s “It Boy” Tatum, couldn’t live up to the pair’s last collaboration Magic Mike ($39.1M from last summer) and opened mildly with $10M, according to estimates, from 2,605 theaters for a per-screen average of only $3,845. I have a hard time imagining Soderbergh will be happy to go out on a note like this, so I’m betting he’ll be back in the next couple of years.The rest of the top 10 had a familiar look to it as Oscar films continued their push to Super Sunday on the 24th of this month. Leading the pack in its 13th weekend was Silver Linings Playbook, which fell a slim 11% to $6.9M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its total to $89M. Fifth place belonged to the fairy tale darlings Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters which dropped 39% from last weekend to an estimated $5.8M, bringing its cume to $43M.Sixth place belonged to the horror-thriller Mama which slipped 34% to an estimated $4.3M and a current total of $63.7M, impressive for a horror film. Jennifer Lawrence’s biggest rival for the Best Actress Oscar landed in seventh place as Jessica Chastain and Zero Dark Thirty slid 23% from last weekend to $4M, according to estimates, bringing the war thriller to $83M.On an amazing award winning streak, Ben Affleck’s Argo added 470 theaters this weekend and jumped back into the top 10 in its 18th weekend, adding an additional $2.5M, according to estimates, bringing its total to $123.2M. Fellow Best Picture nominee Django Unchained took in an estimated $2.3M this weekend, bringing Quentin Tarantino’s highest grossing film to $154.2M. And rounding out the top 10 was the Sylvester Stallone flop Bullet to the Head which dropped 56% from its dull opening to an estimated $2M, bringing its miserable total to $7.9M. One other film of note, the 3D IMAX re-release of Tom Cruise’s classic Top Gun debuted just outside the top 10 with $1.9M from 300 screens for a per screen average of $6,333, second best in the top 20.The top ten films grossed $85.8M which was down 49% from last year when The Vow and Safe House both debuted north of $40M; and down 33% from 2011 when the triumvirate of Just Go With It, Justin Bieber: Never Say Never and Gnomeo &amp; Juliet all opened between $25M and $30M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"the, History, review, richard, Month, Channel, Brie, Country, Company, the, finale, Talk, versus","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Identity-Thief-Scores-Big-in-Debut"},{"id":"47509121154834","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers Heat Up to Warm Bodies","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers Heat Up to Warm Bodiesby Gitesh Pandya | February 4, 2013 |  CommentsSuper Bowl weekend was ruled by the adorable undead as the zombie romantic comedy Warm Bodies opened at number one leading a dull frame with lackluster ticket sales. The Big Game routinely crushes ticket sales on Sunday weakening weekend numbers and studios either avoid programming any good films, or use it as an opportunity to counter-program to young women – the demographic least affected by America’s biggest sporting event. The Top 20 sank to just $82M, down a sharp 31% versus last year.Delivering a solid opening weekend, Warm Bodies easily topped the chart with an estimated $20M debut averaging a commendable $6,655 from 3,009 theaters. The PG-13 film about a zombie who develops feelings for a human gal offered an interesting new twist on the decades-old genre and connected with young women. The rating helped especially since six of the next seven films on the chart were rated R. Warm Bodies played to a 60% female audience and 65% were under 25. This demographic has been mostly turned off by the barrage of action films over the last few weeks but responded to something more appealing. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+ for the Summit film and reviews were very positive.Paramount’s chart-topper Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters fell 53% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.2M giving the studio $34.5M after ten days. A $50M final seems likely for the $50M-budgeted actioner. Academy Award contender Silver Linings Playbook once again enjoyed the best hold in the top ten taking in an estimated $8.1M for a slim 14% decline. The Weinstein Co. has now amassed $80.4M.Down 49% in its third round was the supernatural thriller Mama with an estimated $6.7M and $58.2M to date for Universal. Sony’s Oscar contender Zero Dark Thirty followed with an estimated $5.3M, sliding 45%, to $77.8M thus far.The unlucky streak for action movies continued as audiences steered clear of the new Sylvester Stallone flick Bullet to the Head which crapped out in sixth place with an estimated $4.5M from 2,404 theaters for a dismal $1,872 average. For the aging action hero it was his worst opening for a wide release in over three decades and fell below the dreadful debuts in recent weeks for his Expendables co-stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jason Statham who anchored The Last Stand ($6.3M opening) and Parker ($7M), respectively.Stallone successfully rebranded himself in recent years with Rocky Balboa, Rambo, and the two Expendables hits. But Bullet featured no beloved character that audiences were familiar with plus no known co-stars to help bring in the loot. The audience skewed older male as studio research showed that men made up 60% of the crowd while 81% were over 25. The CinemaScore was a disappointing B-.Parker followed in seventh with an estimated $3.2M tumbling 54% in its sophomore frame. The FilmDistrict release should end with just $18M. The rest of the top ten was filled up by a trio of blockbuster Oscar nominees for Best Picture with decent holds considering it’s Super Bowl weekend. Quentin Tarantino hopped over the $150M mark for the first time with Django Unchained which grossed an estimated $3M, off 39%, for a $151M cume for The Weinstein Co. Former front-runner Lincoln dipped 38% to an estimated $2.4M while the musical Les Misérables collected the same amount after a 43% decline. Disney has banked an impressive $170.8M for the Daniel-Day Lewis hit while Universal has taken in $141.5M with rival Best Actor contender Hugh Jackman.Among other nominees for Hollywood’s top trophy, awards season juggernaut Argo took 11th place in its 17th weekend of release with an estimated $2.1M after jumping up 16% after adding 47% more theaters to the run. Ben Affleck’s hostage crisis hit has won all three top guild awards from the PGA, SAG, and DGA and is now in a commanding position as Oscar voting begins. However, it does lack the Best Director nomination which has been such a critical component for most – but not all – Best Picture winners. Argo will now follow the path of one of two films. 1995’s Apollo 13 won the same three guild titles only to lose the Best Picture Oscar to Braveheart. It also had no Academy nod for Director. But 1989’s Driving Miss Daisy won Best Picture without even earning a Best Director nomination. One of these rare cases will repeat itself this year.Fox’s Life of Pi, another of this year’s Best Picture contenders, dropped 30% to an estimated $1.8M upping the total to $106.1M. The French-language film Amour expanded screens by 47% and watched its weekend gross inch up 6% to an estimated $497,000. Sony Classics has collected $2.5M so far. By Oscar night, seven of the nine Best Picture nominees could be over the $90M mark. That should drive TV ratings higher since so many of the contenders have been seen by so many people. This year’s crop has a substantial amount of mainstream appeal.Oscar winners Al Pacino, Christopher Walken, and Alan Arkin failed to draw in any sales for their new old-timers dramedy Stand Up Guys which flopped with an estimated opening weekend of just $1.5M, according to estimates. The Lionsgate release averaged a weak $2,276 from a moderate release in 659 locations and attracted lackluster reviews.The top ten films grossed an estimated $64.9M which was down a sharp 26% from last year when Chronicle opened at number one with $22M; and down 5% from 2011 when The Roommate debuted in the top spot with $15M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"WarnerMedia, psycho, The, king, Mudbound","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Moviegoers-Heat-Up-to-Warm-Bodies"},{"id":"47509121151760","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Latest Die Hard Leads Presidents’ Day Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Latest Die Hard Leads Presidents' Day Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | February 17, 2013 |  CommentsThe Presidents’ Day holiday frame saw three films generate $20-25M in ticket sales but the action sequel A Good Day to Die Hard made enough to earn the number one spot. Comedy holdover Identity Thief dropped to second place while the new romance Safe Haven bowed in third. Overall box office was down from last year’s robust holiday while Oscar contenders for Best Picture remained popular with moviegoers looking for quality cinema.Bruce Willis anchored his first solo number one hit in thirteen years with his return as John McClane in A Good Day to Die Hard which grossed an estimated $25M over the Friday-to-Sunday period. The R-rated Fox release averaged a good but not stellar $7,036 from 3,553 locations and grossed $33.2M since its Thursday launch on Valentine’s Day. The five-day debut including Monday Presidents’ Day should end up about $10M less than the $48.4M five-day Wednesday-to-Sunday opening of the last film in the series, Live Free or Die Hard from June 2007 which was the only PG-13 chapter in the series. The new Russian-set story enjoyed higher ticket prices plus some IMAX premiums. The prior film, 1995’s Die Hard with a Vengeance, bowed to $22.2M which would be roughly $40M at today’s prices.Reviews were dreadful for the poorly-titled Good Day, easily the worst ever for the quarter-century-old franchise. The story found the wisecracking cop heading to Moscow to help his son, a CIA agent in trouble with master criminals. Older action heroes have been rejected by audiences lately with both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone striking out in recent weeks with The Last Stand and Bullet to the Head, respectively. But based on his most popular character, Bruce saw more box office on his opening day of Die Hard than those films took in on their entire opening weekends.A Good Day to Die Hard skewed as expected to older men. Studio research showed that 55% of the crowd was male and 65% was 25 and older. The CinemaScore grade was a respectable B+. While domestic interest in Die Hard has cooled, overseas numbers were hot. The fifth Die Hard grossed $61.5M from 63 markets this weekend upping the international total to $80.1M including some Asian markets like Korea and Taiwan which debuted last weekend. Leading the way were the U.K. with $7.6M, Japan with $6.8M, Russia’s $6.7M, and Germany with $6.4M. Korea stands at $8.8M after its sophomore frame with France and Brazil opening next weekend plus China and Australia launching in March. Many Latin American markets more than doubled the openings of the last Die Hard. A final worldwide cume of over $350M is possible for the new pic. Action franchises like these usually continue on thanks in large part to overseas revenue potential.Last weekend’s muscular number one smash Identity Thief found another sizable audience in its second round with an estimated $23.4M for an encouraging decline of only 32%. Universal has amassed a sizable $70.7M in ten days and could be headed for a finish in the vicinity of $130M. That is an impressive amount for a film that cost only $35M to produce.Young women propelled the new romance Safe Haven into third place with an estimated $21.4M from 3,223 theaters for a solid $6,649 average. The Relativity release debuted at number one on Thursday with $8.8M because of Valentine’s Day but held its own over the weekend too leading to a $30.3M four-day start from Thursday-to-Sunday – just $3M behind the much more expensive Die Hard.Reviews were dreadful, but that is common for romance movies based on Nicholas Sparks novels. Starring Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough, the PG-13 film played to an audience that was 71% female and 68% under 25. Safe Haven’s four-day start was even with the $30.5M three-day debut of 2010’s Dear John, also based on a Sparks book, which had much more starpower with Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried.The Weinstein Co. scored a victory in fourth place with the 3D animated film Escape From Planet Earth which bowed to an estimated $16.1M over the three days since its Friday debut. With zero kidpics released by studios so far this year, the PG-rated toon had the family market all to itself and averaged a decent $4,886 from 3,288 locations. The CinemaScore was a B+.Hollywood has programmed an excessive number of R-rated action films into the first two months of the year to go along with the string of adult-skewing Oscar contenders which have been mostly rated R. That created a huge void for this segment of the audience and with schools off for the long holiday frame, parents had no other options. The performance of Escape was especially good for a movie not based on a well-known brand, not from a big supplier of animated movies like Pixar or DreamWorks, and not featuring any major names in the voice cast. The Monday holiday should add plenty more for the long four-day weekend. Reviews were poor.The hit zombie romance Warm Bodies scored a hot sophomore frame dipping only 21% against stiff competition collecting an estimated $9M. The Summit film has now grossed a stellar $50.2M in just 17 days and should continue to see much more thanks to terrific word-of-mouth. Picking up lost business due to last weekend’s east coast blizzard played a factor, but audiences are liking this unique story which is becoming a sleeper hit.Bodies may have siphoned off some of the target audience for the supernatural tale Beautiful Creatures which bombed debuting to just $7.5M from 2,950 locations for a weak $2,529 average. Taking in $10M since its Thursday release, the PG-13 film based on the best-selling young adult novel hoped to connect with young women. But competition was tough and reviews were not encouraging. A middling B CinemaScore does not bode well for a teen-skewing film made to make most of its money upfront.Steven Soderbergh’s drama Side Effects enjoyed a decent hold in its second weekend dipping 32% to an estimated $6.3M pushing the ten-day cume to $19.1M for Open Road. Best Picture contender Silver Linings Playbook once again eased by a scant amount. The Weinstein Co. hit grossed an estimated $6.1M, off only 5%, for a $98.5M total. It will crack nine digits on Monday or Tuesday.Falling 40% to an estimated $3.5M was Paramount’s Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters which has banked $49.7M to date. Rounding out the top ten was Oscar contender Zero Dark Thirty which slipped just 23% to an estimated $3.1M giving Sony $88M overall.In the final full weekend before the Academy Awards, moviegoers kept sampling all the major contenders with four more Best Picture nominees filling up spots on the chart with small declines. Front-runner Argo dipped only 6% to an estimated $2.2M putting Warner Bros. at $126.9M domestically and $204M worldwide. The Ben Affleck hit lands on Blu-ray this Tuesday and is preparing itself for a new audience on multiple platforms should it win Best Picture next Sunday. Lincoln, another big player, eased 10% to an estimated $1.7M for a cume to date of $176.3M. Worldwide is $235.3M.Ang Lee’s Life of Pi declined by only 13% in its 13th weekend to an estimated $1.5M for $110.8M so far in North America and a stunning $577M globally. The Weinstein Co. collected an estimated $1.5M as well for Django Unchained, down 35%, with $157M domestic to date. Worldwide is now up to $365.6M. Les Misérables suffered the worst drop of any Best Picture contender falling 45% to an estimated $855,000 with $145.6M overall. Sony Classics expanded the French-language hit Amour and saw sales surge 92% to an estimated $721,000. Cume is $3.9M.All eight Best Picture contenders that are still in theaters now finished in the Top 20 this weekend. The nine nominees together have grossed a whopping $918M domestically and an eye-popping $2 billion worldwide. Oscar ratings should see a boost this year since so many movie fans have actually seen so many of the top contenders.The top ten films grossed an estimated $121.3M which was down 12% from the Friday-to-Sunday portion of last year’s Presidents’ Day frame when Safe House climbed into the number one spot with $23.6M; and down 4% from 2011 when Unknown debuted in the top spot with $21.9M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"festival, The, talk","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Latest-Die-Hard-Leads-Presidents-Day-Weekend"},{"id":"47509119465225","title":"Box Office: Evil Dead Possesses America","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Evil Dead Possesses AmericaPlus, dinosaurs rule IMAX with the release of Jurassic Park 3Dby Gitesh Pandya | April 8, 2013 |  CommentsThe horror remake Evil Dead led a solid session thanks to a number one debut while holdovers G.I. Joe: Retaliation and The Croods fared well giving the marketplace three films grossing north of $20M each. Plus the 3D re-release of the dino-smash Jurassic Park also scored points with audiences driving the top ten to over $125M in ticket sales. Ticket buyers also caught up on recent hits as four films in the top ten enjoyed low declines of 20-30%.Sam Raimi scored his second number one hit of the year, this time as just producer, with the horror remake Evil Dead which topped the box office this weekend with an opening of an estimated $26M. Averaging a sizzling $8,595 from 3,025 theaters, the R-rated fright flick earned good reviews and capitalized on a built-in fan base of genre lovers who idolized the 1983 original which Raimi directed. The filmmaker’s Oz ranked seventh and remains the highest-grossing film of the year.The Evil Dead performance was driven by upfront business and all signs show that sales will drop sharply in the days and weeks ahead. Friday kicked off with $11.9M in opening day business which included $1.8M from shows starting at 10:00pm on Thursday night. Saturday then tumbled a disturbing 26% while audiences gave the remake a lousy C+ grade from CinemaScore indicating low customer satisfaction. Sony estimates that Sunday will dip 40% to $5.3M. Studio research showed that 56% of the crowd was male while 56% was 25 and over.It bested the $21.7M opening of Texas Chainsaw 3D from the first weekend of this year but did nearly match that film’s $8,193 average from about 400 fewer theaters. But Evil did not benefit from any 3D surcharges. Dead nearly matched the $28.4M opening of the PG-13 spookfest Mama from January which remains the top horror opening of the year.Two former number ones held up well and tied for second place with weekend estimates of $21.1M each. Paramount’s G.I. Joe: Retaliation fell 48% which was good for an action sequel raising the cume to $86.7M after 11.5 days. The patriotic flick opened midweek taking opening day business off of Friday, but the Easter holidays helped pump up the Friday-to-Sunday opening frame so the decline was quite respectable given the way the film was launched. Joe should reach $130-140M domestically. Overseas markets grossed an estimated $40.2M boosting the international take to $145.2M and the worldwide tally up to $231.9M with China and Japan still to come. Produced for $130M, Retaliation may find itself with global grosses of $450M or more easily beating the $302M of its 2009 predecessor which cost more to make.Pulling in the same weekend gross, but with a slimmer 21% dip, was the animated hit The Croods from Fox and DreamWorks Animation. The cavepeople pic, still the only toon in town for families, lifted its cume to a stellar $125.8M after 17 days and is now on course to reach roughly $190M from North America. If it continues to post strong holds – no new kidpics open this entire month – then it even has a shot at hitting the $200M mark.Croods is now playing out much like the leggy DreamWorks hit How To Train Your Dragon from three years ago. Opening weekends were $43.6M and $43.7M, respectively. Second weekend declines were 39%/34% and third weekend drops were 21%/14%. After the same number of days, Croods is running less than 6% behind the $133.4M of Dragon which eventually ended with $217.6M. Worldwide, the pre-historic comedy has now amassed $332.6M surpassing the $304M final of the last DreamWorks title, Rise of the Guardians, on its way to the $500M mark and beyond.The 3D re-release of Steven Spielberg’s dinosaur mega-hit Jurassic Park found a sizable new audience grossing an estimated $18.2M from 2,771 theaters for a solid $6,585 average. Compared to recent 3D upgrades, it was better than the $16.7M of September’s Finding Nemo and the $17.3M bow of Titanic from this same weekend last year, but below the $22.5M of Star Wars Episode I from February 2012. An amazingly high 32% ($6M+) of the weekend gross came from 312 IMAX screens. Moviegoers felt this was an experience worth paying extra for. Universal spent $10M to convert the film to 3D.As a brand name, Spielberg remains popular with audiences continuing to pay to see his imaginative and thrilling adventures on the big screen. Studio research showed that 55% of the audience was male and 54% was 25 and older. Jurassic Park grossed $357.1M during its original run in 1993 and now stands at $375.3M lifetime putting it at number 20 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters. The 3D re-release was also aimed at re-invigorating the Jurassic Park brand since the fourth chapter in the series will be shot soon for a summer release next year. As with the last installment, Spielberg will produce but not direct.Two spring hits tied for fifth place with $10M a piece, according to estimates. The FilmDistrict actioner Olympus Has Fallen declined by an encouraging 29% in its third round pumping the cume up to a sturdy $71.1M. Look for a final gross of more than $90M with an outside chance of even reaching $100M if positive buzz from action fans keeps spreading. Next weekend will see no new action titles opening. Tyler Perry’s Temptation fell by 54% in its second weekend which was average for the filmmaker. With $38.4M in ten days, Lionsgate could end up with around $55M.Oz the Great and Powerful held up well in its fifth weekend grossing an estimated $8.2M, off just 30%, for a $212.8M cume to date. With international markets kicking in an additional $13.6M, the worldwide total now stands at $454.1M as 2013’s top blockbuster. The sci-fi flop The Host fell 51% in its sophomore round to an estimated $5.2M. Open Road has collected a dull $19.7M in ten days and will finish off with roughly $30M.Female-driven movies The Call and Admission rounded out the top ten with estimated weekend takes of $3.5M and $2.1M, respectively. The Halle Berry thriller dipped only 29% for a healthy $45.5M cume for Sony while the Tina Fey dramedy declined by 37% giving Focus a lackluster $15.4M to date.It was an active weekend in the specialty marketplace. Danny Boyle’s new psychological crime thriller Trance debuted to sparkling results with an estimated $136,000 from only four theaters in New York and Los Angeles for a potent $34,000 average. Fox Searchlight goes nationwide into nearly 400 theaters on Friday. Sony Classics opened Robert Redford’s newest film The Company You Keep in just five locations grossing an estimated $146,000 for a sturdy $29,200 average. The Shia LaBeouf pic will take a slower path with another 25 sites next weekend, an additional 75 on April 19, and then nationwide on the 26th.Focus enjoyed solid results for its second weekend expansion of the Ryan Gosling-Bradley Cooper starrer The Place Beyond The Pines which went from four to 30 playdates collecting an estimated $695,000 this weekend for an encouraging $23,167 average. Friday marks its national break with about 450 theaters in play.The top ten films grossed an estimated $125.4M which was up 9% from last year when The Hunger Games stayed at number one for a third time with $33.1M; and up 28% from 2011 when Hop stayed in the top spot with $21.3M in its sophomore session.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"SundanceTV, DC, Arts, First, Television, curtis, Dead, Alien, Kids, Month, Broadway, Disney+, your, Winners, cancelled","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Evil-Dead-Possesses-America"},{"id":"47509121165078","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ultraviolent Pics Lead First Weekend of 2013","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ultraviolent Pics Lead First Weekend of 2013by Gitesh Pandya | January 7, 2013 |  CommentsJust as with last year, 2013 kicked off its first frame with an overperforming horror flick debuting at number one as audiences powered Texas Chainsaw 3D to the top spot. Holiday holdovers fared well with most dropping by about 30% from last weekend’s sturdy session.Lionsgate generated a better-than-expected debut for its fright sequel Texas Chainsaw 3D which bowed to an estimated $23M from 2,654 locations for a muscular $8,666 average. The R-rated film which gives a 3D update to the continuing story of horror icon Leatherface played to a young adult audience which had very little product to be excited about in December. Studio research showed that 64% of the crowd was under 25 and 52% was female.Chainsaw attracted business from the horror crowd thanks to a well-known brand but also tapped into urban audiences thanks in part to the casting of musical artist Trey Songz who has over 5 million followers on Twitter and 14 million fans on Facebook. He actively promoted the movie to his fans who came out in huge numbers. $1.15M of the weekend gross came from shows starting at 10pm on Thursday night. Moviegoers polled by CinemaScore gave the fright flick a C+ grade.Early January is a lucrative time for Hollywood to open scary movies. The cheery mood of Christmas is over so fans are ready for some creepy violence plus a large number of college students are still on their winter breaks. The Devil Inside smashed expectations a year ago this weekend with its $33.7M debut at number one while the first weekend of next year has already been claimed by The Amityville Horror: The Lost Tapes launching on January 3, 2014.Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained was tops among all holdovers and broke the $100M mark in just its second weekend of play. The R-rated revenge pic declined by only 33% to an estimated $20.1M boosting the 13-day cume since its Christmas Day bow to a sturdy $106.4M. It joined the century club on Saturday in its 12th day of release. With its strong hold and expected Academy Award nominations this week, Django stands a good chance of reaching the $150M barrier and will easily become the director’s highest grossing film ever.Suffering the largest drop of any film in the top ten, three-time box office champ The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey took in an estimated $17.5M falling by 45% from last weekend. The Middle Earth adventure has now grossed $263.8M in 24 days and cracked the quarter-billion mark in only 22 days. Warner Bros. still has a shot at reaching $300M on this one. Hobbit raked in another $57.1M overseas this weekend with the international total climbing to $561M putting the worldwide haul at a towering $824.8M.As former Academy Award host Anne Hathaway prepares her Oscar acceptance speech, her hit musical Les Miserables landed in fourth place in its sophomore frame with an estimated $16.1M with a decent 41% decline. The Universal hit broke the $100M mark after 13 days of release with a cume so far of $103.6M. Cash will keep rolling in over the weeks ahead. On Thursday it will receive many nominations from the Academy which could help broaden appeal and next Sunday it may just sweep the Comedy/Musical category at the Golden Globes which attracts a very large TV viewing audience, especially adult women. Les Miserables grossed an estimated $14.5M overseas from only 17 territories boosting the international total to $81M and the global gross to $184.6M. Korea and Japan lead the way offshore with $28.9M and $25.2M, respectively.Fox’s family comedy Parental Guidance followed in fifth place with an estimated $10.1M, off 30%, raising the cume to $52.8M. Enjoying a similar hold was Tom Cruise’s action title Jack Reacher which slipped 32% to an estimated $9.3M in its third round. Paramount has banked $64.8M to date domestically while 15 new international markets opened this weekend leading to an overseas frame of $22.3M for an international cume of $55.6M and a worldwide tally of $120.4M.The Judd Apatow comedy This is 40 placed seventh with an estimated $8.6M, down 31%, for a sum of $54.4M thus far. Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln spent its eighth straight weekend in the top ten (none at number one) by sliding only 28% to an estimated $5.3M for $143.9M to date for Disney. International openings through Fox will begin soon after it secures its boatload of Oscar nominations this week.Barbra Steisand’s road comedy The Guilt Trip followed by dropping 31% to an estimated $4.5M giving Paramount $31.2M. The Matt Damon drama Promised Land expanded nationwide after a week in limited release but didn’t find many takers with an estimated $4.3M weekend. Focus averaged a weak $2,573 from 1,676 locations and has collected a measly $4.7M to date. Land had no awards buzz, mixed reviews from critics, heavy competition, and featured a big action star that does not sell well in dramas.In limited release, Oscar hopeful Zero Dark Thirty expanded from 5 to 60 theaters in major cities and delivered a rock solid performance with an estimated $2.75M weekend and potent $45,833 average. Sony goes fully nationwide on Friday into 2,400+ locations and aims to get extra ammunition for its marketing assault the day before when Academy nods are announced. Total is now $4.5M.Summit went national with its tsunami drama The Impossible which grossed an estimated $2.8M from 572 sites (up from 15) for a mediocre $4,825 average. Total is just $3.4M. More theaters will be added Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $118.8M which was off 1% from last year when The Devil Inside opened at number one with $33.7M; but up 33% from 2011 when True Grit remained in the top spot with $14.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Television, latino, TV, Wars, Kids","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ultraviolent-Pics-Lead-First-Weekend-of-2013"},{"id":"47509122870047","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ralph &amp; Flight Make B.O.

Soarby Gitesh Pandya | November 4, 2012 |  CommentsThe holiday box office season started with a bang thanks to the one-two punch of two new releases that pulled in sold-out audiences – the animated video game comedy Wreck-It Ralph and the Denzel Washington drama Flight. The pair led the top ten to a healthy 19% jump over the same frame last year. And with tens of millions affected last week by the deadly hurricane Sandy, it was questionable what impact theaters would see but compelling product brought people out of their homes and into the multiplexes putting the film industry in a good position going into the final weeks of the year.Disney topped the box office with its video game-inspired 3D toon Wreck-It Ralph which opened at number one with a muscular $49.1M, according to estimates. The PG-rated film about a bad guy from a game who wants to become a hero scored a fantastic result thanks in part to its appeal outside of just kids and parents. The studio launched the pic in 3,752 locations and averaged a potent $13,086 per theater.Studio research showed that 54% of the audience was male and that families made up only 68% of the crowd indicating good business from teens and young adults, many of whom were drawn in by the concept and humor. 38% of the gross came from 3D screens. Reviews were good further encouraging moviegoers to give this one a try and the solid A grade from CinemaScore suggests that word-of-mouth will be strong moving forward. With holidays coming up and no competing family films hitting theaters until Thanksgiving, Ralph should hold up well and could reach the neighborhood of $175M or more from its domestic release alone.Generating the third biggest opening in history for an R-rated film bowing in under 2,000 theaters was Denzel Washington’s pilot drama Flight with an estimated $25M from only 1,884 locations for a spectacular $13,275 average. The Paramount release capitalized on the bankability of its leading man and also benefitted from glowing reviews from major critics as well as Oscar buzz. Also assisting was director Robert Zemeckis who returned to live-action filmmaking after a decade of work in the motion-capture field. The only R-rated films to ever open higher while launching wide in fewer than 2,000 locations were 1999’s The Blair Witch Project ($29.2M) and 2006’s Borat ($26.5M).Washington has proven to be one of the most durable stars in the business who brings out his fan base each and every time and 2012 has been a landmark year for the 57-year-old double Oscar winner. His CIA thriller Safe House opened powerfully with $40.2M last February on its way to $126.2M. Both figures are second best in his career trailing just American Gangster‘s $43.6M and $130.2M from 2007 which, like Flight, launched on November 2. Washington has proven repeatedly that he can draw in millions of fans when playing an anti-hero role.Budgeted at just $31M, Flight carried broad appeal across genders as the split saw just a tiny edge towards males with 51%. Older adults made up the bulk of the crowd as a whopping 89% was over 25. The CinemaScore was an encouraging A- and with holidays ahead, the film stands an excellent chance of reaching the $100M mark. Despite the reduced theater count (Safe House bowed in 3,119 sites), Paramount has no plans to expand next weekend. Competition for adults will get tough soon with Friday’s launch of Skyfall which is expected to follow sensational results in international markets and also open huge. Then Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln debuts wide the following week on November 16.Despite Denzel distracting adults coast to coast, Ben Affleck’s hostage crisis hit Argo still showed exceptional strength dipping a mere 15% to an estimated $10.2M bumping up the total to date to an impressive $75.9M. Warner Bros. should easily cross $100M from North America alone on this one.The martial arts actioner The Man with the Iron Fists made a soft debut in fourth place with an estimated $8.2M from 1,868 locations for a mild $4,400 average. The R-rated action pic from hip hop veteran RZA who makes his feature directorial debut co-stars Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu and skewed towards young urban males. Budgeted at $15M, the Universal release attracted an audience that was 64% male and 53% under 30. Reviews were not too great and audiences were not especially pleased with their investment of time and money as the CinemaScore grade was a dull C+.In its fifth frame, Liam Neeson’s action sequel Taken 2 showed the kind of stamina that its predecessor enjoyed by slipping just 22% to an estimated $6M. Fox has banked an impressive $125.7M to date driven by older adults. The sci-fi epic Cloud Atlas fell by a reasonable 45% in its second weekend to an estimated $5.3M giving Warner Bros. a dismal $18.3M in ten days. A $30M domestic final seems likely for the $100M+ budgeted project.The fall’s top-grossing film Hotel Transylvania took a direct punch from Ralph and fell 52% to an estimated $4.5M boosting the cume to $137.6M for Sony. Until now, its drops had always been in the range of 25-36%. The horror fourquel Paranormal Activity 4 grossed an estimated $4.3M, down 50%, and has scared up $49.6M to date.Holding up well in its fourth round was the Kevin James comedy Here Comes the Boom which declined by 31% to an estimated $3.6M and a $35.6M total. Rounding out the top ten was the fright flick Silent Hill: Revelation which tumbled 59% during the post-Halloween frame to an estimated $3.3M giving Open Road $13.9M after ten days.Overseas action was once again dominated by James Bond as Skyfall, the 23rd film in the lucrative series, invaded most of the rest of the world in its second weekend grossing a jaw-dropping $156M propelling the international cume to a towering $287M in just ten days. Germany led the new markets with a $23.9M opening which was an impressive 77% bigger than Quantum of Solace, the last in the 007 franchise. The United Kingdom dipped just 25% in its second round to a stunning $25.7M for an amazing ten-day score of $85.8M. Skyfall drops into North America on Friday and will help the Sony release on its way to a global tally of $800M or much more.The top ten films grossed an estimated $119.5M which was up 19% from last year when Puss in Boots remained at number one with $33.1M; but down 13% from 2010 when Megamind opened on top with $46M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Amazon, in, song, El, King, Walt, movies, Office, WGN, Video","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ralph-and-Flight-Make-BO-Soar"},{"id":"47509122866974","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Skyfall Scores Bond’s Biggest-Ever Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Skyfall Scores Bond's Biggest-Ever OpeningSpielberg's Lincoln has a strong limited release bow.by Gitesh Pandya | November 11, 2012 |  CommentsJames Bond won a landslide victory at the North American box office which finally got the latest 007 adventure Skyfall which continued to break franchise records. The 23rd film in the 50-year-old series opened to an estimated $87.8M this weekend from 3,505 theaters for a stunning $25,050 average beating out lofty industry expectations to become the biggest Bond opening ever. Adding in Thursday’s $2.2M from an early full-day launch in 463 premium large format screens (including 320 IMAX) the four-day bow came to an eye-popping $90M. Daniel Craig anchored for the third time, Judi Dench returned for her third decade in the series, and newcomers Javier Bardem and Ralph Fiennes joined the cast in this installment.The Friday-to-Sunday debut was a sturdy 30% bigger than the $67.5M opening of the last Bond picture Quantum of Solace in 2008 and a whopping 115% better than the $40.8M of 2006’s Casino Royale which was Craig’s first turn in the tuxedo. Skyfall also blew away Pierce Brosnan’s best opening as the dashing MI6 agent – $47.1M for 2002’s Die Another Day. These last three 007 films all opened in mid-November and finished with $160-170M domestically.Directed by Oscar-winner Sam Mendes (American Beauty), Skyfall earned glowing reviews from film critics and also won over ticket buyers with an encouraging A grade from CinemaScore. Add in the 7% jump in sales from Friday to Saturday (fellow sequel Quantum dipped 4%) and the newest Bond is set up well for the weeks ahead as positive word-of-mouth should lead to continued strength into December. Competition from A-list action vehicles is also minimal over the next few weeks. Rival studios were scared away by Skyfall which arrived as the only new wide release this weekend.Friday kicked off with $31.7M, Saturday rose to $33.9M and Sunday is estimated by Sony to slide 35% to $22.2M. A fantastic $13.1M of the weekend business came from IMAX screens marking that company’s best non-summer opening ever. Studio research showed that 60% of the audience was male and 75% was over 25. That marked a much older and more male skew than Quantum which was 54% male and 58% over 25. Due in part to MGM’s bankruptcy issues, a very long four-year gap was created in between 007 films. Brosnan’s first three spy films were released just two years apart while his final one was three years after the previous installment. Together, the four pictures grossed $1.5 billion worldwide making for some mighty big shoes that Craig had to fill, which he has since done with authority.Domestically, Skyfall delivered the seventh biggest November opening in history and the best for anything outside of the Twilight and Harry Potter franchises. The final Bella pic Breaking Dawn Part 2 opens next weekend in over 4,000 locations and will easily swipe the top spot. For 2012, Skyfall was the fourth best debut of the year and was in good company behind The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises, and The Hunger Games. Based on past Bond trends, Skyfall has a very good chance of climbing past $250M by the end of its domestic run and will beat out every past Bond, Jason Bourne and Mission Impossible film domestically, internationally and worldwide.Speaking of the rest of the planet, Skyfall remained a juggernaut collecting an estimated $89M in its third weekend of international release. That propelled the overseas cume to $428.6M and the global haul to a stunning $518.6M smashing the half-billion-dollar barrier in a mere 17 days. Even more impressive is the fact that this massive tally includes just one weekend from North America and nothing yet from Japan which opens on December 1 and China which is still finalizing release plans. To date, Craig’s trio of 007 blockbusters have grossed a combined $1.7 billion worldwide and counting.On Monday, the new Bond will surpass the $432.2M of Casino Royale to set a new franchise record for international grosses. That pic also holds the global record with $599.6M and that mark should be obliterated next weekend. Also on Monday, Skyfall will become the second biggest blockbuster of all-time in the U.K. trailing just Avatar. It has amassed a towering $117.5M there to date and is holding up exceptionally well with $18.2M, off just 30% in its third frame. The global gross is on course to pass $900M and with such lucrative markets still to come, it may just become the first billion-dollar Bond.For those not interested in Javier Bardem’s bleached blonde hair, another bad guy seized second place with the 3D animated hit Wreck-It Ralph collecting a stellar $33.1M, according to estimates. in its sophomore round. The Disney hit dropped by only 33% and watched its ten-day cume soar to a terrific $93.7M. Compared to original toons opening on the first weekend of November, Ralph‘s second weekend drop was better than the 37% of 2010’s Megamind but on par with the 33% of 2007’s Bee Movie. Wreck-It Ralph will crack the $100M mark later this week thanks in part to Monday’s school closings due to the observance of Veterans Day, and then could end up with $170M+. Direct competition does not arrive until the Thanksgiving release of DreamWorks Animation’s Rise of the Guardians.Paramount saw a respectable hold for its Denzel Washington drama Flight which dropped 39% to an estimated $15.1M lifting the ten-day total to a solid $47.8M from under 2,100 theaters. The R-rated pic expanded slightly in its second weekend upping its theater count by 9%. while the average fell by 44%. A final gross near the $85M mark may result which would be encouraging given that Washington and director Robert Zemeckis lowered their fees to make the pic at a cost of only $31M. In its sophomore round, Flight averaged $7,377 from 2,047 sites.Ben Affleck’s Oscar hopeful Argo dropped 34% (its biggest dip yet) to an estimated $6.7M and raised its cume to $85.7M for Warner Bros. on its way to the century club. Fox’s kidnapping sequel Taken 2 followed with an estimated $4M, off 32%, for a total of $131.3M.Despite the arrival of an 800-pound gorilla in Skyfall, the overall marketplace remained robust with the top five holdovers all declining by less than 40% each. And the top four movies are all big studio offerings that have won plenty of praise from film critics so multiplexes are filled with quality product right now.The rest of the top five featured films in a tight range separated by just $200,000 so the final order may change on Monday when official weekend grosses are reported. Sony’s comedy Here Comes the Boom has been holding up well and took in an estimated $2.55M, down just 28%, putting the sum at $39.1M. Close behind with an estimated $2.53M was the Wachowski flop Cloud Atlas which fell 53% giving Warner Bros. only $22.7M to date which won’t even cover marketing expenses.The martial arts actioner The Man with the Iron Fists collapsed in its sophomore frame falling 68% to an estimated $2.5M and $12.7M in ten days for Universal. The testosterone flick tied with the estrogen comedy Pitch Perfect which bounced back into the top ten thanks to amazing legs. The college comedy enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten easing just 18% pushing the cume up to an impressive $62M. Rounding out the list with an estimated $2.35M was the hit toon Hotel Transylvania which fell 47% and has banked $140.9M to date. It is now the fifth highest-grossing film of Adam Sandler’s career which has included 13 entries into the century club.Steven Spielberg’s much-hyped political drama Lincoln got off to a sensational start in platform release opening to an estimated $900,000 from only 11 locations for a scorching $81,818 average. Earning strong reviews, the PG-13 film stars Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th U.S. president during his time after re-election as he fought with Congress to pass an amendment to abolish slavery. Lincoln was produced by DreamWorks and distributed through its deal with Disney. It expands nationwide this Friday into over 1,500 theaters as it tries to establish itself as a serious Oscar contender that can also play to paying audiences. Spielberg’s subject matter is much more American this time compared to his one-two punch last holiday season when he directed The Adventures of Tintin and the World War I saga War Horse.The top ten films grossed an estimated $159.1M which was up 28% from last year when Immortals debuted at number one with $32M; and up 48% from 2010 when Megamind remained on top with $29.1M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"politics, drama, Pet, play, Paquin, Emmys, History, awards, Fall, review","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Skyfall-Scores-Bonds-BiggestEver-Opening"},{"id":"47509122841369","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Dominates Global Box Office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Dominates Global Box Officeby Gitesh Pandya | December 17, 2012 |  CommentsFans of Middle Earth ended their long wait and charged into North American multiplexes powering the new fantasy adventure The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey into the number one spot breaking the December opening weekend record in the process. Audiences around the world made the Peter Jackson film the most popular movie on the planet as no other studio dared to challenge Bilbo Baggins and his gang with any other new releases.The Hobbit scored an estimated $84.8M in ticket sales this weekend accounting for about 60% of the marketplace. Warner Bros. opened the first chapter of this new trilogy in 4,045 total domestic theaters (also a new December record) and averaged a sensational $20,958 per location. The adventure tale was offered in many different viewing formats including 3D, IMAX, and High Frame Rate (HFR) as well as combinations of these formats. 3D was offered in 3,160 of the locations (6,500 total screens) while HFR was in 461 sites and 326 theaters had IMAX. 3D and IMAX screens had higher ticket prices which helped to boost the overall gross. Audiences were evenly split on paying extra for the additional dimension. 2D accounted for 51% of the gross while 49% was from the 3D screens.A new December opening weekend record was set by Hobbit. The previous high was set five years ago this very weekend when Will Smith’s I Am Legend bowed to $77.2M with no help from 3D. Avatar had the biggest December debut for a 3D film with $77M in 2009. Factoring in three years of ticket price increases, Hobbit’s opening weekend audience size was roughly the same as Avatar’s. Both were near-three-hour effects-driven 3D epics from Oscar-winning directors opening on a mid-December Friday.The turnout for the new Gandalf flick was extremely front-loaded. Friday kicked off with $37.5M including a stunning $13M from Thursday night post-midnight shows. Saturday tumbled 25% to $28.2M while the studio is projecting a 32% drop on Sunday to $19.1M. The breakdown over the three-day period was very similar to the debut frame of The Hunger Games from last March which, like Hobbit, had a huge midnight start, did 44% of its weekend gross on Friday and had a 25% drop from Friday-to-Saturday. Both films also earned a solid A grade from CinemaScore. After its front-loaded start, Hunger went on to have strong legs topping the charts for four consecutive weeks. Hobbit has the Christmas and New Year’s holidays still to come plus no competing event films are opening soon so its road ahead looks promising.Males made up 57% of the audience and those over 25 were 58% of the crowd. IMAX venues grossed $10.1M accounting for a solid 12% of the weekend take. This was a brand that fans felt was worth paying extra for. Plus IMAX screenings offered a special preview featuring the first nine minutes of next summer’s Star Trek Into Darkness from Paramount. Last December, it was Paramount’s Mission: Impossible IMAX release which was coupled with the opening scenes of The Dark Knight Rises from Warner Bros. The studio did not have a breakdown for the HFR sales on Unexpected Journey.The Hobbit invaded much of the world this weekend and opened to an excellent $138.2M from 56 international markets since its Wednesday launch in initial territories. That amounts to a worldwide opening of $223M with the holidays still to come. Also, major markets like Russia (December 19), Australia (December 26), and China (TBD) are still to open. 3D was more popular outside of North America where the screens accounted for 60% of the gross. Leading the way were the U.K. with $18.3M, Germany with $16.3M, France with $12.7M, and Korea with $8.5M.Produced with MGM, the new Middle Earth trilogy will continue with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug which bows this same week next year on December 13, 2013, followed by the final chapter The Hobbit: There and Back Again opening the following summer on July 18, 2014. Warner Bros. has slotted the final Hobbit into the key July frame that the studio found enormous success with in past years with its recent Dark Knight and Harry Potter films.Slipping only 29% and rising into the second place slot was the animated adventure Rise of the Guardians with an estimated $7.4M. Paramount has grossed $71.4M to date and is hoping that strength over the coming Christmas holidays will get it into the century club. After securing seven Golden Globe nominations, the most for any film, Disney expanded the run of its historical drama Lincoln which placed third with an estimated $7.2M. Adding 271 locations, the Steven Spielberg hit dipped only 19% in its sixth round upping the cume to $107.9M. On Thursday, the presidential pic became the director’s 15th $100M+ domestic grosser and the first for Daniel Day-Lewis who is currently seen as the front-runner to win the Best Actor Oscar.The James Bond smash Skyfall followed in fourth with an estimated $7M, down 35%, for a total to date of $272.4M. Agent 007 collected an additional $12.2M overseas boosting the international gross to $678.7M and the global haul to a staggering $951M. It should break the $1 billion mark before the year is up.Off 35% in its fourth round was the 3D epic Life of Pi with an estimated $5.4M giving Fox’s Ang Lee film $69.6M to date. Pi earned three Golden Globe nominations including Best Picture – Drama and Best Director. This weekend saw an estimated $11.5M from a limited number of international markets for an overseas total of $129.4M led by China’s humongous $84.3M. The worldwide figure stands at $199M. The vampire juggernaut The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 fell 44% to an estimated $5.2M pushing the cume to $276.9M. It is currently running $10.5M (4%) ahead of Part 1 from this time last year.Hit toon Wreck-It Ralph slipped 33% to an estimated $3.3M giving Disney $168.8M to date. Close behind with an estimated $3.2M was the Gerard Butler flop Playing for Keeps which fell 44% in its second weekend. The FilmDistrict release has banked a puny $10.8M in ten days.Grossing an estimated $2.4M was FilmDistrict stablemate Red Dawn which declined by 44% for a $40.9M cume to date. Rounding out the top ten was Silver Linings Playbook which jumped back onto the list thanks to its scant 4% dip to an estimated $2.1M despite having no extra screens added. The Weinstein Co. release scored four big Globe nods including Best Picture – Comedy or Musical and showed that while the awards may not have much prestige or industry respect, they do make an impact on general moviegoers and studio marketing campaigns and can drive extra ticket sales. Total is now $17M from 371 theaters with an expansion planned for Christmas.The top ten films grossed an estimated $128M which was up 21% from last year when Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows opened at number one with $39.6M; and up 2% from 2010 when TRON: Legacy debuted in the top spot with $44M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"satire, Kemper, cancelled, movies, cooking, Turner, Awards, Comics, Arrowverse, Holidays, DC, Superheroes","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hobbit-Dominates-Global-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509121168151","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Threepeats, Western &amp; Musical Rock","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Threepeats, Western &amp; Musical Rockby Gitesh Pandya | December 30, 2012 |  CommentsFor a third consecutive frame, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey led the North American box office but this time was joined by a trio of new releases opening on Christmas Day which filled up the next spots on the charts over a red hot final weekend of 2012.Smashing through the $200M barrier, The Hobbit collected an estimated $32.9M in its third journey pushing the 17-day cume up to a sizable $222.7M. Warner Bros. enjoyed a slim 11% decline and fared very well during this past Christmas week. Finishing with $290M seems very likely while reaching the $300M mark remains a possibility as well. Hobbit should surpass $700M globally before the start of 2013.Quentin Tarantino enjoyed the biggest debut of his career with his latest film Django Unchained which took in an estimated $30.7M over the weekend and a superb $64M in the six days since its Christmas Day launch on Tuesday. That’s already bigger than his old career best opening week (first seven days) of $53.7M for his last film Inglourious Basterds which debuted on a summer Friday in 2009.The slave Western starring Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, and Leonardo DiCaprio averaged a strong $10,195 from 3,010 locations making for the best average of any wide release. That is especially impressive for an R-rated film that runs nearly three hours long. Controversy related to Django’s language and violence resulted in extra press coverage and more buzz and multiplexes enjoyed the benefits.The Weinstein Co. is positioning the revenge film as both an awards contender and a commercial blockbuster and so far is succeeding on both fronts. Reviews have been very positive and the CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A-. Django Unchained already seems on track to beat the $120.5M of Basterds to become Tarantino’s highest grossing film ever.Finishing close behind in third place was the acclaimed musical Les Miserables with an estimated $28M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a sturdy $67.4M since its Christmas launch. The Universal release averaged a terrific $9,960 from only 2,814 locations and is aiming for a long run ahead thanks to excellent word-of-mouth and upcoming awards activity including Oscar nominations and Golden Globe wins which are expected.The Hugh Jackman-led film started off with the second best Christmas Day opening in history with $18.2M on Tuesday trailing only the $24.6M Friday of Sherlock Holmes in 2009. Compared to Django, Les Miserables has seen more erosion over the six-day launch period. But since it is based on a world-famous musical, the run was expected to have a big upfront showing of die-hard fans. Studio exit polls showed that the audience was 67% female with the overall CinemaScore being a glowing A grade.Produced for $61M, the PG-13 film enjoyed international success too with $38.3M this weekend from only eight markets, mostly in the Pacific Rim, for a $48.7M cume and $116.2M worldwide total so far with plenty more to come. Korea accounts for nearly half of the overseas tally with a sensational $20.1M beating the opening of The Hobbit.Opening in fourth place was the Billy Crystal-Bette Midler family comedy Parental Guidance with $14.8M and $29.6M since its Christmas Day bow. The PG-rated pic about grandparents having to care for their modern grandkids averaged a moderate $4,396 over the weekend period. With few clean options this holiday season that the whole family can enjoy together, Guidance connected with its target audience and will now try to keep it going through January when direct competition will still be light. Fox’s $25M production played to a crowd that was 52% female and 55% over 25. Reviews were lousy.Tom Cruise dropped down to fifth place with his latest action entry Jack Reacher which dipped a reasonable 10% to an estimated $14M pushing the ten-day total up to $44.7M for Paramount. Judd Apatow’s new comedy This is 40 climbed up 14% from last weekend and grossed an estimated $13.2M for a ten-day take of $37.1M. The Paul Rudd-Leslie Mann pic picked up steam after Christmas once its target audience became more available, however the Universal title still sits far behind the $65.9M that Knocked Up grossed in its first ten days in 2007.Moviegoers with extra time on their hands caught up with one of the hottest Oscar hopefuls out there, Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln. The Daniel Day-Lewis starrer surged 36% from last weekend – the best jump in the top ten – and took in an estimated $7.5M bumping the cume up to a sturdy $132M for Disney. The Republican president has been cleaning up at the box office and has plenty of firepower left especially with the expected boatload of Oscar nominations coming in less than two weeks. Lincoln is now the top-grossing drama of 2012. Another older-skewing film that saw sales climb from last weekend was the Barbra Streisand comedy The Guilt Trip which banked an estimated $6.7M, up 24% from its disappointing debut. The Paramount title has collected only $21.1M in 12 days.Animated films rounded out the top ten. Disney’s 3D re-release of Monsters, Inc. shot up 33% and grossed an estimated $6.4M for $18.5M after 12 days. The Pixar hit’s lifetime total now stands at $274.4M. Rival DreamWorks Animation suffered a 17% decline for its holiday adventure Rise of the Guardians which did an estimated $4.9M upping the cume to $90.2M. Studios missed out on a major opportunity by not releasing any major new toons this Christmas.The James Bond cash cow Skyfall fell from the top ten in its eighth round, however it reached a key milestone by breaking the $1 billion barrier in worldwide box office. Sony’s spy actioner captured an estimated $4.6M domestically, off a scant 2%, raising its sum to an incredible $289.6M. Overseas, Daniel Craig and company took in $10.3M boosting the hefty international tally to $710.6M and the worldwide haul to a cool $1B. In the U.K, Skyfall has become the top-grossing film of all-time and the first blockbuster ever to cross the £100M mark.The Weinstein Co. went fully nationwide with its awards contender Silver Linings Playbook widening the seven-week old comedy from 371 to 745 locations and made an estimated $4.1M for a $5,517 average – commendable for a film this old. The average was higher than last weekend’s despite the expansion which indicates that audiences are still interested in the Bradley Cooper-Jennifer Lawrence pic regardless of the flood of other Oscar hopefuls out there. Cume to date is $27.4M.The acclaimed Osama bin Laden manhunt pic Zero Dark Thirty suffered a 23% drop from its red hot debut last weekend which was unusual for a holiday frame when moviegoers are more available. Still, Sony’s Kathryn Bigelow-directed thriller averaged a sensational $63,000 from only five theaters in New York and Los Angeles. Zero expands to more cities on Friday including San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston and goes nationwide on January 11, one day after Oscar nominations are announced.Lacking awards buzz, Matt Damon’s new film Promised Land attracted a mild debut in limited release grossing an estimated $190,150 from 25 locations for a $7,606 average. Focus plans to expand nationwide on Friday into an aggressive 1,500 theaters which will be challenging given the opening weekend performance and the fact that rival arthouse pic The Impossible – which has earned better reviews and stronger box office – also goes wide on the same day. Reviews have been mixed for Promised Land.The top ten films grossed an estimated $159.1M which was up 18% from last year when Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol was number one with $29.4M; and up 16% from 2010 when Little Fockers remained in the top spot with $25.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Pictures, spanish, 2016, IFC, breaking, Annual, TCM, WGN, psychological, finale, 2019, Channel, Rocketman, Tomatazos, 99%","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hobbit-Threepeats-Western-and-Musical-Rock"},{"id":"47509122857756","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Twilight Leads Feeding Frenzy on Record Thanksgiving","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Twilight Leads Feeding Frenzy on Record Thanksgivingby Gitesh Pandya | November 26, 2012 |  CommentsMoviegoers across North America stampeded into theaters driving the box office up to a record-breaking Thanksgiving holiday frame led by a mix of commercial hits, family films, and Oscar hopefuls. It was a true team effort as no one film broke through $45M over the Friday-to-Sunday weekend period. However, the top ten did see seven movies in double-digit millions, five over $20M, and four pictures averaging more than $10,000 each. Almost every dish on the turkey menu connected with audiences with the five-day Wednesday-to-Sunday span witnessing a jaw-dropping $290M in consumer spending, not counting the overpriced popcorn.Staying put at number one for a second time was the final chapter of the vampire soap opera The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 with an estimated $43.1M dropping 70%, exactly like Part 1 did one year ago last Thanksgiving. The Summit film has banked an impressive $227M after ten days (up 3% vs. Part 1’s $220.8M at the same point) on its way to a final of about $290M from the domestic market. The five-day Wednesday-to-Sunday tally was an incredible $64M.Overseas, Bella and Bella Junior grossed a stellar $97.4M from 73 territories boosting the international sum to $350.8M and the worldwide haul to $577.7M allowing the five-film franchise to smash the $3 billion mark in cumulative grosses. Part 2 will become the highest-grossing installment in the series with possibly $800M or more from around the world. Four of the five Twilight films were released on the lucrative weekend before Thanksgiving and Summit’s new owner Lionsgate has already planted flags on those frames over the next three years for its remaining Hunger Games films.Another fan of mid-November is James Bond (6 of his last 7 pics launched then) and the secret agent found himself in second place once again with Skyfall grossing an estimated $36M for an encouraging decline of just 12%. That was a better Thanksgiving weekend hold than for past pics. Quantum of Solace fell by 30% (also in its third round) while Daniel Craig’s first outing in Casino Royale saw a 25% dip in its sophomore frame. Audiences are liking Skyfall and it’s the only action movie on a grand scale that is in the marketplace right now. Releasing it everywhere else in the world before America hasn’t stopped it from becoming a megahit here. With a stellar $51M over the long five-day holiday session, the 007 pic raised its domestic total to an amazing $221.7M becoming the first Bond film to crush the double-century mark. It should now be able to surpass $275M and even has an outside chance at hitting $300M.Sony’s international markets grossed an estimated $41.3M on Skyfall this weekend while MGM’s distribution partners did not have updates as of Sunday. Australia generated a hefty $12.5M debut this weekend while the United Kingdom’s cume surged to $144.5M after its fifth round. That put the global gross at over $790M with Japan set to open on Saturday. Craig’s three-pack of Bond films have collectively grossed just under $2 billion.Posting an incredible take for a two-and-a-half-hour historical drama in its second weekend of wide release, Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln followed with an estimated $25M over three days and $34.1M across five from only 2,018 playdates. The Daniel Day-Lewis presidential pic rose a healthy 19% from last weekend’s wide break. Part of that was due to the addition of 243 locations but even the per-theater average of $12,398 inched up 5% from a week ago signaling strength with its audience and sustained interest. Lincoln has collected $62.2M to date and Disney should expect a trip to the $100M club, the 15th for Spielberg as a director. With lots of Oscar talk and Day-Lewis seen as the frontrunner to win Best Actor (some industry insiders call him a lock), the sturdy legs should continue into December.A trio of PG-rated 3D films followed. Leading the way among the holiday weekend’s new releases was the DreamWorks Animation offering Rise of the Guardians which came in below expectations with an estimated $24M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and $32.6M over five days. Playing in 3,653 sites, the comedic adventure pic about Santa Claus, Jack Frost, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, and Sandman all teaming up to fight the Boogey Man from hurting kids averaged a mediocre $6,577 per theater. The five-day holiday opening came in below the three-day non-holiday debuts of past DreamWorks films like Puss in Boots, Bee Movie, Over the Hedge, and How to Train Your Dragon. In fact, Guardians suffered the worst opening for a DreamWorks Animation production since the $10.1M five-day holiday launch of the 2003 bomb Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas.With Christmas ahead and Rise having a winter and holiday theme to it, the $145M production could certainly display legs for the rest of the year. But 3D animated movies from the industry’s mightiest players with huge marketing pushes and coveted holiday release slots always do better. Reviews were generally positive and good enough for what these types of family films require. But competition may have been a factor with the next two films on the charts, Life of Pi and the resilient Wreck-It Ralph, taking away some of Guardian’s audience. The animation giant’s distribution deal with Paramount ends this year with Fox taking over the releasing duties in the spring.A glowing A CinemaScore grade bodes well for the future as the toon hopes to benefit from solid recommendations from those who did come out this long weekend. Only 35% of the business was from 3D screens. Rise opened in China last week, Russia this weekend (at the top spot) and invades 50 international markets next weekend for its major overseas push. 3D animated films tend to do significantly more business outside of North America.Opening in fifth place was Ang Lee’s 3D adventure drama Life of Pi which captured an estimated $22M over the weekend from 2,927 theaters and a robust $30.2M over the five-day holiday. Averaging a solid $7,516 over three days, the PG-rated film about a teen from India stranded in the Pacific on a boat with a tiger has earned strong reviews from critics and plenty of Oscar talk in the Best Picture race. A high 68% of the gross came from 3D which was widely praised in reviews.The opening was on par with how Martin Scorsese’s Academy Award-winning Hugo did this same weekend a year ago. Both films were from Oscar-winning directors using 3D for the first time, based on best-selling books, had adolescent protagonists, great reviews, awards chatter, and were set outside of the U.S. The major difference was that Hugo was released in less than half the number of theaters. It bowed in fifth place over the turkey frame as well to the tune of $11.4M from 1,277 theaters for a $8,899 three-day average and $15.4M five-day debut. Given how the more narrow release packs more people into the available showtimes, the difference in averages between Pi and Hugo was not too significant. The Scorsese picture did go on to expand out to 2,600+ locations during December and then re-expand in late January when Oscar nominations were announced while Life of Pi is already very wide and so has less room to widen in future weeks. But the road ahead looks bright since word-of-mouth is good and critics lists and awards nominations can keep momentum going. The CinemaScore grade was an A-, good but not amazing.Studio research showed that Pi skewed 52% male and 60% 25 and older. The film was never an easy sell given that it had no major stars, no American connection, plus the marketplace had no shortage of high-profile options for those looking for a powerful drama or something for the whole family. Overseas, Pi launched in four markets with $17.5M led by $10.5M from China on 4,500 3D screens and $3.4M from India in 697 locations. It rolls out around the world over the weeks ahead with many launching right before Christmas.Still pulling in strong business in its fourth round of play, Disney’s Wreck-It Ralph took in an estimated $16.8M representing a slim 10% slide from last weekend. That was an impressive hold especially with Guardians and Pi both coming into the marketplace as last Thanksgiving’s holdover toons dropped 31-37% each. It was also the best gross all year for any toon in its fourth frame beating out hits like The Lorax and Brave. With a hefty $23M in business across the five-day turkey span, Ralph has now smashed up $149.5M and has plenty more to go as it entertains kids as well as older nostalgia-loving gamers. 19 international territories have added $41.2M so far for a global gross of $190.7M to date.Posting a respectable opening in seventh place was the long-delayed remake Red Dawn with an estimated $14.6M over three days and $22M across the long five-day frame. Produced by MGM and released by FilmDistrict, the PG-13 film starring Chris Hemsworth (Thor) averaged a decent $5,358 over the Friday-to-Sunday period. Males overwhelmingly led the way making up 62% of the audience for the tale of a group of American teens that must defend a small town from an invasion by the North Korean military. 52% were 25 and older. The 1984 original led by Patrick Swayze featured Soviet baddies. With weak reviews and a lukewarm B CinemaScore grade, the road ahead looks bleak.Films in the thick of the race for a Best Picture Oscar nomination rounded out the top ten. Denzel Washington’s Flight held up incredibly well grossing an estimated $8.6M, off a scant 2%, boosting Paramount’s cume to $74.9M. The Weinstein Co. successfully expanded the latest of its handful of awards contenders, the critically-acclaimed Silver Linings Playbook, into wider play and nabbed ninth place with an estimated $4.6M from just 367 locations for a terrific $12,597 average. The Bradley Cooper-Jennifer Lawrence indie comedy has collected $6.5M to date and will continue to expand in December.Rounding out the top ten in its seventh weekend on the list was the Oscar player Argo with an estimated $3.9M, down 4%, giving Warner Bros. $98.1M to date. Ben Affleck’s hostage crisis drama is a week away from breaking into the century club. Overseas, Argo has taken in an additional $50M to date with most of awards season still ahead.The period costume drama Anna Karenina expanded modestly in its sophomore round taking in an estimated $832,000 from 66 locations (up from 16) for a $12,606 average. The figure was solid, but should get diluted down as it rolls out into second-tier markets in the weeks ahead. Fox Searchlight debuted its Anthony Hopkins-Helen Mirren pic Hitchcock on Friday in 17 locations and grossed an estimated $301,000 for a $17,706 average. Reviews have been mixed and not at the level of top awards contenders, although the lead actors have gotten good marks.The top ten films surged to an estimated $198.6M which was up a hearty 34% from last year when The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 held at number one with $41.7M; and up 18% from 2010 when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 stayed on top with $49.1M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Television, live, Mary, high, potter, slashers, Century","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Twilight-Leads-Feeding-Frenzy-on-Record-Thanksgiving"},{"id":"47509122872096","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Argo Leads a Lackluster Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Argo Leads a Lackluster WeekendPlus, none of the new releases performs very well.by Gitesh Pandya | October 29, 2012 |  CommentsThis weekend, with moviegoers yawning at the four new releases that Hollywood served up, the hit hostage crisis thriller Argo climbed up into the number one spot in its third frame leading an overall lackluster session. Ticket sales took an extra hit on the east coast as people prepared for the arrival of a monster storm set to impact highly populated areas putting an extra dent into an already weak marketplace.Declining by just 25% in its third weekend, the Warner Bros. hit Argo won the box office crown with an estimated $12.4M which boosted the 17-day cume to a solid $60.8M. A final gross at or above the $100M mark still seems possible during its initial run. A re-release in January around the time when Oscar nominations are announced is a possibility which would all but guarantee an invitation to the century club. Argo became the first movie since 2010’s True Grit to rise up to the top spot in its third weekend.Terrific word-of-mouth is helping the Ben Affleck film reach new audiences and its pro-America ending is attracting business from red, blue, and swing states alike. Timing the release to the peak part of the presidential election season was no accident and the strategy is paying off. Upcoming films like Denzel Washington’s Flight, Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln, and the latest James Bond actioner Skyfall will provide stiff competition during the November weeks ahead but Argo hopes to hold its own and capitalize on strong reviews and glowing buzz.It was a tight two-way race for second place but according to Sunday estimates, Sony inched ahead with its blockbuster toon Hotel Transylvania which slipped only 27% to an estimated $9.5M in its fifth weekend. The Sony hit has grossed a stellar $130.4M to date. Over the last 13 years, no September release has grossed more.Opening close behind in third, if estimates hold, was the big-budget sci-fi epic Cloud Atlas which disappointed with an estimated $9.4M launch. The R-rated saga from the Wachowski siblings did manage to score the best per-theater average of any wide release with $4,681 from 2,008 locations including higher-priced IMAX screens. Starring Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, and others, the nearly-three-hour extravaganza turned out to be too experimental for mainstream audiences who could hardly tell from the advertising what the movie was even about.Atlas mixes together multiple stories from various times spanning 500 years with actors playing different roles jumping across race and gender barriers in the various eras. Reviews were mixed but generally more on the positive side. Warner Bros. was hoping that fans of the directors of the Matrix trilogy would come out for their newest adventure. However, these filmmakers have not had a film that truly excited all sci-fi fans since the first Neo pic in 1999 which put them on the map in the first place. The Matrix sequels from 2003 left a bad taste in the mouths of many while their 2008 take on Speed Racer was a commercial and critical bomb.Cloud Atlas will have a difficult road ahead as indicated by its troubling C+ CinemaScore grade. Studio research showed that the audience was mostly split evenly with males making up 51% of the crowd. The age breakdown was different as the film skewed much older with 77% being over 25. With a budget of over $100M, the sci-fi pic will be hoping for a sizably better response from international audiences which just may happen. Last year’s period action epic The Three Musketeers, also co-financed by German money, opened in North America to a similarly weak $8.7M but fared well overseas with the rest of the world accounting for a whopping 85% of its global gross.Suffering the worst second weekend drop yet for the franchise, Paranormal Activity 4 crumbled by 70% to an estimated $8.7M and raised its total to $42.6M since opening at 9pm two Thursdays ago. Last October’s third installment in the hit Paramount series tumbled by 65%. Look for the new chapter to end its run quickly in the area of $55M, or about half of the $104M of the last film, putting the domestic total for the four-pack of thrillers at about $350M with combined production costs of only $13M. Paranormal Activity 4 grossed $14.1M overseas this weekend from holdover markets and a dozen new territories. The international total sits at $48.3M while the global tally is now $90.9M with Japan, France and other markets set to open this next week..Two more sequels followed and were tied for fifth place with an estimated $8M each. Liam Neeson’s Taken 2 declined by a reasonable 40% pushing the cume to $117.4M for Fox. Open Road debuted its offering for Halloween with the 3D horror pic Silent Hill: Revelation but was met with a dismal $2,728 average from 2,933 theaters. The sequel came out a long time after its predecessor which debuted to a strong number one showing with $20.2M in April 2006. With a weak brand and ample competition from other fright films like Paranormal and Sinister, Revelation failed to generate any excitement. Poor reviews did not help any.Dropping only 35% was the Kevin James comedy Here Comes the Boom with an estimated $5.5M and a cume of just $30.6M for Sony. Word-of-mouth has been helping the horror hit Sinister which dipped only 43% in its third weekend to an estimated $5.1M for a solid $39.5M to date for Summit and Lionsgate. The companies also saw an estimated $5.1M for their detective thriller Alex Cross which fell a sharp 56% in its sophomore frame. With $19.4M in ten days, look for a $30M final.The Halloween teen comedy Fun Size crashed and burned with a poor tenth place bow collecting an estimated $4.1M from a very wide 3,014 locations for a pathetic $1,347 average. Paramount earned a B CinemaScore from audiences and the crowd was heavily young female. Studio research showed that 67% was female and 73% was under 25 for the PG-13 party pic. Fun Size cost $14M to produce.Following in the footsteps of the other new titles on the menu this weekend, Gerard Butler’s surfing film Chasing Mavericks flopped and was rejected by moviegoers. The Fox release opened to an estimated $2.2M, failed to make the top ten, and generated a dismal $1,099 average from 2,002 theaters. Reviews were bad and the audience was split evenly between men and women. The PG-rated film skewed older with 59% being over 25 while the CinemaScore grade was a respectable B+.Skyfall launched to impressive results in Europe and other territories this weekend with a stellar opening of $77.7M from 25 markets hitting the top spot everywhere. The United Kingdom led the way with $32.4M which was the second biggest Friday-to-Sunday opening in history trailing the final Harry Potter pic which was in 3D. The British debut was 30% higher than Quantum of Solace, the last film in the franchise. Other top openings included $9.1M in France, $8.6M in Russia, $6.5M in Brazil, and $6.1M in Korea. Additional countries get Skyfall next weekend while North America is among the final markets for the Sony smash with its November 9 debut. Bond films typically open stateside in mid-November close to the Thanksgiving holiday when overall moviegoing is robust. Domestically, Quantum opened one week before the first Twilight film while the latest 007 debuts a week prior to the vampire franchise’s closing installment.The top ten films grossed an estimated $75.6M which was down 16% from last year when Puss in Boots debuted at number one with $34.1M; and off 10% from 2010 when Saw 3D opened on top with $24.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"directors, First","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Argo-Leads-a-Lackluster-Weekend"},{"id":"47509124457262","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Fourth Ice Age Pic Opens On Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Fourth Ice Age Pic Opens On Topby Gitesh Pandya | July 16, 2012 |  CommentsIn the calm before the Batstorm, just one new release dared to enter the marketplace. Fox’s 3D animated sequel Ice Age: Continental Drift topped the North American box office in its domestic debut leading a weekend session that fell below year-ago levels. Most holdovers enjoyed relatively low declines with just one title in the top ten falling by more than half. Studios mostly avoided opening anything big in fear of getting pulverized a week later by The Dark Knight Rises.Playing to a young audience that PG-13 comic book pics don’t cater to, Ice Age: Continental Drift opened at number one with an estimated $46M from 3,881 locations for a $11,853 average. It was the fourth chapter of the lucrative series, and second in 3D. The debut did not reach the levels of recent 3D summer toons Brave and Madagascar 3 which bowed to $66.6M and $60.3M, respectively. As the third big-brand offering in this genre over the last six weeks, some families may have felt they did not need to reach into the wallet again so soon for another pricey group outing to the multiplex. Reviews were not too positive but audiences were pleased giving the PG-rated film an A- grade. The demographic breakdown was basically even between males and females, and those over and under 25, indicating a broad audience.Drift opened just like the first installment of the series. The original Ice Age premiered to $46.3M in March 2002 on its way to $176.4M. But ticket prices were a lot lower then and there were no 3D surcharges so admissions on the new installment were much less. However, the prehistoric comedy franchise makes the bulk of its money overseas nowadays and Fox’s international launch two weeks ago got business going early. This weekend, Drift topped the offshore box office with a mammoth $95M propelling the international total to a stellar $339M and the global gross to $385M. Overseas cash for the first three films skyrocketed with the titles going from $207M to $461M to $691M. The entire Ice Age franchise has now raised its worldwide haul to an amazing $2.3 billion and the newest chapter should easily surpass $750M globally at its current trajectory.Sony took second place with its super hero reboot The Amazing Spider-Man which posted a strong hold in its second weekend taking in an estimated $35M for a 44% decline allowing the 13-day total to top the double century mark with $200.9M. Compared to other tentpoles opening midweek near the Fourth of July holiday, the webslinger fared well beating the 48% drop of 2007’s Transformers, the 49% of 2008’s Hancock, the 51% of 2010’s The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, and the 52% of last summer’s Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Of course, none of them faced a humongous juggernaut like The Dark Knight Rises in its third frame so chances are Amazing will get flattened from this Thursday night onwards. Still, a domestic final of around $280M could result.As with so many action franchises and 3D event films, The Amazing Spider-Man is seeing robust results around the world. It ranked second at the overseas box office with $66.6M pushing the offshore tally to $320.4M and global gross to $521.3M on its way to more than $800M. This weekend, the four-installment Spider-Man franchise broke the $3 billion mark in global box office.Leading the way among non-franchise films was the runaway hit comedy Ted which posted another terrific hold grossing an estimated $22.1M for a slender 31% decline. The R-rated hit smashed the $150M mark in just 16 days and has banked an incredible $159M to date. The $50M production is benefitting from strong word-of-mouth, low competition from raunchy comedies, and the starpower of Seth MacFarlane. If you’re a grown-up and want to laugh, there have hardly been any other good options this summer. A final gross of around $215M seems likely putting it ahead of such higher profile and more expensive summer offerings like Men in Black 3, Prometheus, and Snow White and the Huntsman. Early in its international run, Ted is doing gangbusters in Australia with $25.5M after its second weekend at number one, plus a slim sophomore slide.With a new 3D toon in town, Pixar’s Brave dropped 46% to an estimated $10.7M putting the 24-day sum at $195.6M. The Scottish princess continues to play like the animation studio’s 2008 flick WALL?E which dropped 46% to $10.1M in its fourth frame in July 2008 when it faced the opening of The Dark Knight. Brave looks capable of reaching more than $230M domestically.Male beefcake landed in fifth place as Channing Tatum and pals collected an estimated $9M with their stripper flick Magic Mike, off 42%, giving Warner Bros. $91.9M to date. The R-rated hit will cross the $100M mark in another week. Oliver Stone’s latest film Savages enjoyed a decent sophomore hold dropping 45% to an estimated $8.7M for a ten-day total of $31.5M. The $45M production is playing to an older more patient audience and had zero competition from newcomers so Universal’s decline was not exactly fabulous.Lionsgate followed with Madea’s Witness Protection which took in an estimated $5.6M, down 45%, for a $55.6M cume. Falling 48% in its second weekend was the music doc Katy Perry: Part of Me with an estimated $3.7M for a total of just $18.6M in 11 days.Enjoying the best hold by far in the top ten was Wes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom which continued to please the smarthouse crowd with an estimated $3.7M slipping a mere 19% in its eighth round. Focus has grossed an impressive $32.4M to date on its way to $45M+. Suffering the worst drop in the top ten was the 3D toon sequel Madagascar 3 which fell an understandable 54% to an estimated $3.5M as it took a severe hit from Scrat. But the Paramount release broke the double century mark and has now banked $203.7M domestically and $473.8M worldwide.The top ten films grossed an estimated $148.1M which was down a steep 40% from last year when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 opened at number one with an industry record $169.2M; and down 13% from 2010 when Inception debuted on top with $62.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Nominations, X-Men, Wars, FX, book, indiana, E!, rt, Out, Television, Podcast, The","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Fourth-Ice-Age-Pic-Opens-On-Top"},{"id":"47509124451115","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Bourne and The Campaign Dethrone the Batman","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Bourne and The Campaign Dethrone the Batmanby Gitesh Pandya | August 12, 2012 |  CommentsUniversal scored its industry-leading third number one opening of the summer with its franchise spy thriller The Bourne Legacy which knocked The Dark Knight Rises out of the top spot after a three-week reign atop the North American box office. Moviegoers also came out in healthy numbers for two new star-driven comedies as the political comedy The Campaign starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis and the marital tale Hope Springs with Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones both connected with their target audiences. After back-to-back weekends when the Top 20 was down by more than 25% from last year, the marketplace rebounded back to normal levels for this time of year.Jeremy Renner anchored a solid, but not spectacular, opening for his latest franchise pic The Bourne Legacy which debuted to an estimated $40.3M from 3,746 theaters for an encouraging $10,749 average. The PG-13 film pulled in action fans despite the fact that star Matt Damon who played the title character of all three previous films, and director Paul Greengrass who helmed the last two installments, were gone this time. Adjusting for ten years of ticket price increases, Legacy sold roughly 400,000 more tickets on opening weekend than the first film in the franchise The Bourne Identity from June 2002.But given the cast and crew changes, Renner having no track record of anchoring a major film, and being among the last in a long line of summer action offerings, Legacy’s performance was reasonably good. The weekend gross was also close to the $40.8M of 2006’s Casino Royale which asked James Bond fans to forget Pierce Brosnan and accept newcomer Daniel Craig. Universal’s decision to bump its release date back a week from August 3 to August 10 certainly paid dividends as it would have split the action crowd with Total Recall last weekend. Plus the juggernaut The Dark Knight Rises was a week older this frame.Legacy played well across gender lines with men making up 52% of the crowd, according to studio research. Those 30 and older were a very high 69% as teen appeal was not strong. Produced for $125M, a reasonable cost for today’s franchise action films, The Bourne Legacy earned mixed reviews from film critics and audiences alike. The CinemaScore grade was a B which means word-of-mouth going forward will probably be only so-so. And the Friday-to-Saturday bump of 6% was just slightly better than the one posted last week by Recall which fell apart in its second weekend. Also challenging its legs will be the opening of another adult-skewing action sequel this Friday in The Expendables 2.Opening to good results in the runner-up spot was the Will Ferrell-Zach Galifianakis political comedy The Campaign with an estimated $27.4M from 3,205 theaters for an impressive $8,562 average. It was the third best opening of the year for an R-rated comedy behind only the $54.4M of surprise smash Ted, and the $36.3M of 21 Jump Street. Ferrell, who has not been seen on-screen with a major film in two years, flexed some starpower and fans eager to see him again turned out. The story involving rival bumbling political candidates provided very relevant subject matter which sparked interest in comedy fans. Plus the marketplace had almost nothing else offering laughs for grown-ups and reviews were better than necessary to sell this type of broad comedy.Produced for $60M, The Campaign will have no problem reaching a domestic gross that beats its production cost. Legs may not be that great as the CinemaScore grade of B- indicates that consumers were not terribly satisfied so word-of-mouth should be mixed. Campaign opened much like Ferrell’s last R-rated comedy Step Brothers which opened four years ago in late July with $30.9M when it also faced competition from both a Dark Knight hit and the Summer Olympics. Ferrell does have fans around the world and huge global crowds saw Galifianakis in both Hangover films so international potential is there, although a story about the world of American elections is not an easy sell.It was two for Batman Begins, four for The Dark Knight, and now The Dark Knight Rises ends its reign at the top of the box office at three weeks. With another franchise action film making a solid debut, the final Batman film from Christopher Nolan dropped 45% to an estimated $19.5M boosting the domestic total to $390.1M after 24 days for Warner Bros. Its 2008 predecessor enjoyed a smaller 39% decline in its fourth frame despite having to compete with the start of the Beijing Olympics. TDKR rose up to number 15 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters passing the $381M of last summer’s final wizard flick Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 which had the benefit of 3D surcharges.The Bane blockbuster is running 12% behind the pace of the Joker flick and still seems to be on a trajectory to end with roughly $445M from North America. Overseas, Rises made $34.2M, off a troubling 49%, for an international total of $445.3M and global haul of $835.4M. Nolan’s Gotham City trilogy has now amassed an incredible $2.2 billion worldwide and counting.Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones enjoyed a respectable start for their relationship comedy Hope Springs which bowed to an estimated $15.6M from 2,361 playdates for a $6,607 average. The PG-13 film about a middle-aged couple seeking counseling to enliven their marriage grossed $20.1M since its Wednesday release and played, as expected, to the Meryl crowd. Studio research showed that the audience was overwhelmingly adult female – 66% were women and 69% were 40 or over. Reviews were positive but not very enthusiastic and paying audiences were not especially excited as the CinemaScore grade was a B.Older skewing films tend to have good legs so Sony is hoping to keep Springs in theaters until the fall and make its grosses over the long-term. The studio has utilized the first half of August to target older women before with 2009’s Julie &amp; Julia starring Streep which debuted to $20M representing only 21% of its final gross of $94.1M, and 2010’s Eat Pray Love with Julia Roberts which opened to $23.1M which was 29% of its $80.6M total. Both were adapted from best-selling books, though, whereas Hope came from an original screenplay. Plus with Sunday’s close of the Olympics, the target audience will become more available in the days ahead. Sony and MGM acquired domestic rights for a fee in the mid-teen millions and Sony handled marketing and distribution duties.A pair of sophomores followed with each dropping on a different trajectory. Fox’s kid sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days fell a reasonable 44% to an estimated $8.2M pushing the ten-day total to $30.6M. A final take close to the $52.7M of the last installment of the series should result. Sony’s much more expensive sci-fi remake Total Recall was not as lucky and tumbled by a troubling 68% to an estimated $8.1M. By comparison, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 1990 original opened at the same level but dropped only 41% to $15.1M in its second weekend. The Colin Farrell actioner has collected a disappointing $44.2M in ten days and looks headed for a $60-65M finish from North America putting even more pressure on international markets to deliver big crowds. An overseas expansion this weekend into new territories like Russia, Japan, and Mexico resulted in an estimated $18.7M frame from 38 markets raising the offshore cume to just $27.5M.The top ten’s only toon Ice Age: Continental Drift held up well again with an estimated $6.8M, off a slender 22%, lifting the sum for the 3D Fox pic to $144.1M. Universal’s hit comedy Ted followed with an estimated $3.3M, down 42%, and a cume to date of $209.9M. 3D dance sequel Step Up Revolution fell 52% to an estimated $2.9M giving Lionsgate $30.2M to date.Two films tied for the ten spot with estimates of $2.2M each. Fox’s alien comedy The Watch crumbled 66% and has banked only $31.4M to date while Sony’s 3D super hero reboot The Amazing Spider-Man fell 50% with a domestic total of $255.5M thus far.The reality stunt pic Nitro Circus the Movie 3D debuted to poor results outside of the top ten with an estimated $1.2M from 800 locations for a dismal $1,460 average. Since debuting on Wednesday, the R-rated Jackass-type flick aimed at young men has grossed $2.2M in five days. Opening to good results in platform release was Spike Lee’s Red Hook Summer with an estimated $42,100 from four New York locations for a $10,525 average. The Variance/40 Acres release earned decent reviews and expands to new markets later this month.The top ten films grossed an estimated $134.2M which was even with last year when Rise of the Planet of the Apes stayed at number one with $27.8M; but up 5% from 2010 when The Expendables debuted on top with $34.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"ABC, discovery, based, 21st, CBS, comics, Dark, Amazon, comic, universal","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Bourne-and-The-Campaign-Dethrone-the-Batman"},{"id":"47509124460335","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Amazing Spider-Man Leads Six-Day Frame","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Amazing Spider-Man Leads Six-Day FrameThe latest Spider-Man film makes $65M for the weekend, and $140M in six days.by Gitesh Pandya | July 8, 2012 |  CommentsThe summer of super heroes continued with the top spot debut of The Amazing Spider-Man which captured the number one spot over its extended holiday opening in North America. Sony’s 3D reboot of the lucrative movie franchise grossed an estimated $65M over the Friday-to-Sunday frame and an exceptional $140M over the six days since its Tuesday launch. It was the fifth best extended opening over the Independence Day holiday trailing Transformers: Dark of the Moon ($180.7M in 6.5 days in 2011), Spider-Man 2 ($180.1M in 6 days in 2004), The Twilight Saga: Eclipse ($176.4M in 6 days in 2010), and Transformers ($155.4M in 6.5 days in 2007). Comparisons are not entirely fair since films debut in different ways with the actual 4th of July holiday falling on a different day each year.Amazing averaged $15,053 from 4,318 locations over the weekend portion. Appeal was broad but older males led the way. Studio research showed that 58% of the crowd was male and 54% was 25 and older. 44% of the gross came from 3D screens which was not too high. $14.3M came from IMAX screens accounting for 10% of the six-day box office. The overall results were solid especially for a property being rebooted so soon. The first Spider-Man opened one decade ago in May 2002 swiping the all-time opening weekend record from Harry Potter while the most recent webslinger flick bowed just five years ago in May 2007 when Spider-Man 3 also set a new all-time opening weekend record taking the crown from Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest. Amazing told the origin story once again before heading into a new hero tale. Many fans felt there was no need to reboot the series at this point in time but actively making a new film allowed Sony to retain the rights to the movie franchise. The studio has the sequel already set for release on the first weekend of May in 2014.The Andrew Garfield-led tentpole began its run with a $35.9M opening day on Tuesday. Sales fell 35% to $23.3M on Wednesday for the 4th of July and then dipped 32% to $15.8M on Thursday giving it $75M in the bank before the weekend period began. Friday rose 31% to $20.7M, Saturday climbed 15% to $23.9M and Sunday is estimated to fall 14% to $20.5M. Reviews were mixed but generally upbeat and audiences were happy with what they paid to see as the CinemaScore grade was an A-. The webslinger has 11 days of super hero business to itself before the July 20 launch of The Dark Knight Rises which is expected to deliver the second largest debut of the year crushing all foes in the process.Overseas, where The Amazing Spider-Man could really mint most of its money, results were strong with an estimated $129.1M this weekend from 70 markets boosting the international total to $201.6M and the worldwide haul to $341.2M. Top new debuts were $18.1M in the U.K., $10.8M from Russia, Mexico with $9.6M, $8M in France, and Australia at $7.5M. Holdover cumes were led by $25.2M in Korea and $20.7M in Japan.Last week’s top film Ted enjoyed a solid sophomore hold despite the arrival of a super hero tentpole grossing an estimated $32.6M for second place. The Seth MacFarlane comedy is benefiting from good word-of-mouth and a lack of competition for comedies for grown-ups right now. Dropping only 40%, the Universal release has upped its ten-day tally to $120.2M and seems headed for an amazing finish near the $200M mark. Ted cost only $50M to produce. Also faring well was the 3D animated hit Brave which slipped 41% to an estimated $20.2M in its third round holding steady in the bronze medal position. The Disney/Pixar release has collected an impressive $174.5M to date.Oliver Stone was back with his latest film Savages which opened in fifth place with a solid $16.2M, according to estimates. The Universal release averaged $6,150 from 2,628 locations and played to mature adults and the director’s fan base. It was the third biggest career debut for Stone after last fall’s Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps and 2006’s World Trade Center. Produced for $45M, the drug thriller Savages was based on the best-selling novel and stars Taylor Kitsch, Blake Lively, John Travolta, Benicio Del Toro and Salma Hayek. Reviews were mixed. The R-rated film skewed older with 61% of the audience being 30 and older while the gender split was even with females accounting for 51% of the crowd. A troubling C+ CinemaScore puts into question the road ahead, however no new films aimed at adults will open next weekend.Channing Tatum’s hit stripper drama Magic Mike fell badly in its second weekend dropping 60% to an estimated $15.6M. The Warner Bros. pic tumbled 41% in its second day of release last weekend hinting at a rocky road ahead and the sophomore performance fell sharply as expected. With $72.8M in ten days, Mike will need to hold up better in the days ahead in order to finish with $100M.Madea’s Witness Protection suffered the usual steep sophomore fall that Tyler Perry films see. The Lionsgate pic fell 60% to an estimated $10.2M boosting the cume to $45.8M on its way to a $60M conclusion. Paramount and DreamWorks Animation followed with their 3D winner Madagascar 3 which took in an estimated $7.7M, off just 35%, for a cume of $196M thus far.The 3D pop music doc Katy Perry: Part of Me bowed in eighth place with modest results grossing an estimated $7.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday span and $10.3M since opening on Thursday. The Paramount release was aimed at teen and tween girls and failed to make it past the multi-platinum singer’s fan base. Playing in 2,730 theaters, the PG-rated pic averaged a dull $2,619 over the weekend. Reviews were good but mostly irrelevant from a commercial perspective since the target audience puts zero value into what middle-aged film critics have to say.The studio saw much better results from pop prince Justin Bieber last year when his 3D concert biopic Never Say Never bowed to $30.3M. Katy had similar marketing gimmicks like special advance showings and interactive engagement with fans over social media. Studio research showed that 81% of the audience was female and 72% was under 25. What little good news the film saw was from its A CinemaScore and low $12M budget.Wes Anderson’s critical darling Moonrise Kingdom eased a scant 6% to an estimated $4.6M giving Focus $26.9M to date. The upscale crowd is still turning out for this as the top smarthouse choice of the moment. Woody Allen’s latest offering To Rome With Love expanded nationwide in its third frame and grossed an estimated $3.5M from 806 theaters for a modest $4,345 average. It was a weaker showing than the veteran filmmaker’s hit from last summer Midnight in Paris which made $5.8M in its first weekend of wide play last June in its fourth round. Rome has met with far less love from critics than Paris did and sits at a total of $5.3M for Sony Classics.The top ten films grossed an estimated $182.7M which was up 30% from last year when Transformers: Dark of the Moon remained at number one with $47.1M; and was even with 2010 when Despicable Me debuted on top with $56.4M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"cars, films, Walt, BAFTA, on, Movies, Esquire, spider-man, Globe, supernatural, lord, Avengers, of, archives, movie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Amazing-SpiderMan-Leads-SixDay-Frame"},{"id":"47509124453164","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Dark Knight Rises Again","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Dark Knight Rises AgainTotal Recall and Wimpy Kid take #2 and #3 in another sluggish weekend.by Gitesh Pandya | August 6, 2012 |  CommentsThis weekend, a pair of new franchise films could not stop Bane and Batman from ruling the North American box office for a third straight time as The Dark Knight Rises continued to reign supreme, once again taking the gold medal position. The big-budget sci-fi remake Total Recall took home the silver while the bronze went to the kidpic Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days. Neither of the new releases showed major muscle and the overall Top 20 slumped 27% from last year’s levels as overall moviegoing continued to be affected by a lack of exciting titles and the ongoing drama of the London Olympics.For a third consecutive weekend, audiences made The Dark Knight Rises the most popular film in the land as the super hero saga grossed an estimated $36.4M, down a reasonable 41% from last weekend. The Warner Bros. smash has now grossed a mammoth $354.6M in only 17 days with $48M of that sum (14%) coming from 332 IMAX locations.If estimates hold, the decline will be slightly less than the 43% dip that 2008’s The Dark Knight suffered during its third frame while on the same calendar. That mega-smash did face stiffer competition as the new action release that weekend, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, bowed to $40.5M which was $14M higher than Total Recall‘s debut. But with threequels often eroding faster, the solid hold Rises saw this weekend could be partly due to moviegoers that skipped the film in the aftermath of the Colorado shooting coming out now. New action sequels are scheduled to launch on the next two weekends, but The Dark Knight Rises could be on course to reach $440-450M domestically.Currently, Rises is running 10% behind the pace of its predecessor which banked $393.8M in its first 17 days with a $42.7M third-weekend gross. The Bane flick has tied Avatar as the third fastest film in history to break the $350M barrier. Only The Avengers and The Dark Knight have done it faster in 10 and 14 days, respectively. TDKR shot up to number 21 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters passing the $352.4M of last summer’s 3D tentpole Transformers: Dark of the Moon.Another impressive weekend gross was collected from overseas markets where the latest Batman film captured an estimated $67M from 58 markets, down a sizable 47%, boosting the international total to $378.4M and the global gross to $733M making it the second largest worldwide hit of 2012 after Avengers which grossed twice as much. The offshore cume is only about a week away from matching the $469M of TDK. Rises is now playing in most major markets around the world, however Italy is still to open at the end of the month and China – which has a quota on foreign films – has not yet been set. Breaking the $1 billion global box office mark seems very possible, putting the Christopher Nolan trilogy on course to gross a combined $2.4 billion or more.The big-budget sci-fi remake Total Recall debuted in second place with an estimated $26M and failed to generate too much excitement with action movie fans. Averaging $7,220 from 3,601 theaters, the PG-13 redo opened only a hair above the $25.5M bow of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger hit despite having ticket prices that were nearly twice as high and playing in 1,500 more theaters. The effects-driven film skewed 58% male while 53% of the audience was 30 and older, according to studio research. A lack of female appeal prevented it from attracting a broader crowd.The Colin Farrell pic never did electrify ticket buyers too much and played out as yet another remake that people did not ask for. Critics and audiences agreed on the quality of the film. Reviews were mostly negative and moviegoers polled by CinemaScore gave it a pitiful C+ grade. And with The Bourne Legacy set to open this Friday and The Expendables 2 on the following weekend, large declines should be in order putting the $150M-budgeted pic on course to reach the neighborhood of $70M from North America. Recall opened at number one in a number of Asian markets this weekend collecting a modest $6.2M from a dozen territories led by Taiwan and Malaysia.Opening in third place was the tween sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days with an estimated $14.7M from 3,391 locations for a mild $4,335 average. The third chapter in the film franchise debuted well below the levels of the first two which each launched in mid-March over the past two years to $22.1M and $23.8M. The summer vacation storyline drew an upfront audience as Saturday sales tumbled 14% from Friday’s opening day score. As a threequel, it could indicate a rocky road ahead although those polled by CinemaScore liked the film which earned an A- grade.Reviews were mostly negative which is common for a kidpic franchise going into its third installment. Studio research showed that the audience was 58% female and 62% under 25. Dog Days cost only $22M to produce and summer yields stronger midweek grosses since students are out of school so surpassing the $50M mark like the last two films is still possible.Two more Fox titles followed. The 3D animated comedy Ice Age: Continental Drift slipped 37% to an estimated $8.4M for a cume to date of $131.9M from North America. Overseas grosses vaulted to an incredible $587M putting the worldwide figure at $718.9M. The studio’s underperforming alien comedy The Watch fell 50% from its opening weekend despite no new comedies for adults entering the marketplace. With $25.4M in ten days, the Ben Still-Vince Vaughn pic should end with just $40M.The film that has really been getting grown-ups to laugh this summer, Seth MacFarlane’s Ted starring Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, smashed the $200M mark this weekend and enjoyed a major expansion into international waters. Domestically, Universal’s leggy hit dipped only 26% to an estimated $5.5M for a total of $203.4M. But a potent $32M was made from 20 overseas markets boosting the offshore total to $77.3M and the global tally to $280.7M. Ted generated a sensational top spot debut in the U.K. with $14.3M and was also number one in a handful of other new markets like Germany and Russia.The dance drama Step Up Revolution tumbled 55% in its sophomore round to an estimated $5.3M pushing the ten-day total to $23.1M for Lionsgate-owned Summit. The decline was similar to the 56% drop that the last film in the franchise, Step Up 3D, suffered two summers ago when it banked a better $29.8M in its first ten days. Look for Revolution to finish with less than $35M.Sony’s super hero reboot The Amazing Spider-Man crossed the quarter-billion threshold in North America this weekend thanks to its estimated $4.3M take in its fifth weekend. Down 36%, the big-budget Sony tentpole upped its sum to $250.6M. Overseas added $6.1M this weekend for a new international haul of $427.1M giving the studio $677.7M worldwide.Two more summer blockbusters rounded out the top ten, one for daughters and the other for moms. The Disney/Pixar hit Brave grossed an estimated $2.9M, off 33%, for a $223.3M cume. With $16.5M from overseas, the Scottish princess broke the century mark internationally with $118M for a worldwide take of $341.3M. Channing Tatum’s Magic Mike fell 47% to an estimated $1.4M giving Warner Bros. $110.9M to date.Opening well in platform release was the Andy Samberg-Rashida Jones relationship comedy Celeste and Jesse Forever which debuted to an estimated $112,000 from only four houses for a sparkling $28,000 average. Sony Classics will expand into San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago, and Washington D.C. on Friday and adds more major cities throughout August before going nationwide over Labor Day weekend. Reviews have been good and indie comedies have been hot this year so the road ahead seems promising.The top ten films grossed an estimated $111.2M which was down 28% from last year when Rise of the Planet of the Apes opened at number one with $54.8M; but up 4% from 2010 when The Other Guys debuted on top with $35.5M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Tubi","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Dark-Knight-Rises-Again"},{"id":"47509124444968","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Possession Opens #1 As Summer Ends","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Possession Opens #1 As Summer Endsby Gitesh Pandya | September 3, 2012 |  CommentsThe summer of super heroes came to a close with a pair of new releases taking the top two spots at the North American box office over the four-day Labor Day holiday frame while comic book hits continued their global domination passing new milestones. The horror pic The Possession debuted at number one, the period crime drama Lawless bowed in second place and holdovers filled up the rest of the top ten with mostly small declines thanks to Monday being a holiday. Overall ticket sales were on par with what the industry has seen recently over this summer-ending frame.Lionsgate enjoyed a solid opening for its supernatural thriller The Possession which spooked up an estimated $21.3M over the long Friday-to-Monday period from 2,816 locations for a sturdy $7,564 per-theater average over four days. The three-day portion was $17.7M. The PG-13 film about a demon living in a creepy box became the first fright film in five years to open at number one over Labor Day weekend. The last was 2007’s Halloween remake with $26.4M over three days and $30.6M over the four-day holiday span. This is the second best opening ever for any film over this holiday after the Michael Myers redo.As with many creepy thrillers of this type, young females drove the business. Studio research showed that 59% of the audience was female and 54% was under 25. Producer Sam Raimi’s name was heavily promoted and a targeted campaign aimed at Latinos also paid dividends. Reviews were negative and audiences polled by CinemaScore gave a mediocre B grade.Opening with modest results in second place was the crime drama Lawless with an estimated $13M from 2,888 locations for a mild $4,501 average across four days. $10M came from the three-day portion. The Weinstein Co. release starring Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, and Gary Oldman collected $15.1M since its Wednesday launch. Reviews were generally positive but overall consumer interest was never very high for the Prohibition-era tale. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+.After its two-week run in the top spot, the action sequel The Expendables 2 dropped to third place with an estimated $11.2M. That gave Lionsgate a cume of $68.6M in 18 days. Universal’s own franchise actioner The Bourne Legacy held up better slipping to an estimated $9.4M over the long weekend upping the cume to $98.4M. It will join its three predecessors in the century club later this week.PG-rated kidpics followed. The Focus toon ParaNorman dropped to an estimated $8.9M while Disney’s dramedy The Odd Life of Timothy Green jumped up to an estimated $8.5M. With the extra time off, Labor Day weekend is often a popular time for parents to go to the movies with their kids before the new school year gets busy. Totals stand at $40.2M and $38.4M.Batfans came out again for The Dark Knight Rises which in its seventh round collected an estimated $7.9M propelling the domestic cume to $433.2M. The four-day gross rose 10% compared to last weekend’s three-day score. That was slightly better than the 6% uptick that The Dark Knight posted over Labor Day weekend four years ago when it cracked the half-billion mark. A final North American haul of roughly $450M seems likely for Rises.Worldwide, the Bane flick cracked the $1 billion mark thanks in part to a solid debut in China this past week. The Christopher Nolan smash collected a rough estimate of $28.5M there across the seven-day opening of Monday-to-Sunday finishing behind the $33.3M launch over the same period for The Amazing Spider-Man which was in 3D and released at the exact same time. For this current weekend in all 64 markets – including Italy which also launched – Rises took in an estimated $46.4M lifting the international take to $574M and the worldwide haul to $1.007 billion edging out the final global gross for 2008’s Joker hit.Another super hero flick hitting a milestone this weekend was The Avengers which crossed the $1.5 billion barrier – only the third movie in history to reach this level and the first one not from James Cameron. Disney re-released it, along with Brave, into over 1,700 theaters for an extra round of cash pushing the domestic figure to $620.3M. Most theaters split one screen programing showtimes for both films. It was a summer of super heroes as the three comic book behemoths grossed a combined $3.25 billion across the globe. To no surprise, a string of new super hero films are already scheduled on the calendar for the coming years including next summer’s Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel.After a stellar nationwide expansion last weekend, the political documentary 2016 Obama?s America fizzled out in wider play grossing an estimated $7.1M for a $4,057 average over four days. The Rocky Mountain release widened from 1,091 to 1,747 theaters but saw its three-day weekend gross drop 22% which was a larger decline than many films in the top ten which had no expansion. The bigger footprint and the buzz coming out of last week’s Republican National Convention was expected to give more of a boost. Still, 2016 has grossed an impressive $20.3M to date and may be headed for the neighborhood of $30M which would be enormous for a documentary.Will Ferrell’s election comedy The Campaign followed with an estimated $7M for a $74.6M cume to date for Warner Bros. Rounding out the top ten with a good hold was Sony’s Hope Springs with an estimated $6M over the long weekend and $53.4M overall.Finding no takers this weekend was the new kidpic The Oogieloves which debuted outside the Top 20 with a pitiful $602,000, according to estimates, over four days. The G-rated film for pre-schoolers averaged a dismal $279 from 2,160 theaters which averaged out to about three tickets sold per showtime.Two new films opening in limited release posted respectable numbers. The phone sex comedy For a Good Time, Call… bowed to an estimated $186,000 from 23 sites for a $8,090 average for Focus. Indomina’s martial arts epic Flying Swords of Dragon Gate starring Jet Li took in an estimated $125,000 from 15 of AMC’s IMAX 3D venues averaging $8,333.With another big movie season coming to an end, the top five domestic blockbusters ended up being The Avengers ($620.3M), The Dark Knight Rises ($433.2M), The Amazing Spider-Man ($260M), Brave ($232.3M), and Ted ($216M).The top ten films grossed an estimated $100.3M over four days which was up a scant 1% from last year when The Help was number one for a third straight frame with $19.9M; and up 7% from 2010 when The American opened on top with $16.7M.Follow Gitesh on The Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"batman, Cannes, america, spider-man, franchise, york, black, hist, green","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Possession-Opens-1-As-Summer-Ends"},{"id":"47509124462384","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Have Wild Time with Ted and Mike","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Have Wild Time with Ted and Mikeby Gitesh Pandya | July 1, 2012 |  CommentsA pair of new R-rated films dominated the North American box office sending ticket sales soaring to a new record for the biggest June weekend in history. The comedy Ted and the drama Magic Mike both overperformed and connected with their target audiences while Tyler Perry’s latest effort Madea’s Witness Protection delivered his usual potent numbers. Overall, it was the third best weekend of 2012 as success came from a handful of original movies and not from one big franchise juggernaut opening. The marketplace is now in great shape entering what will be a gigantic July.Family Guy fans came out in droves for creator Seth MacFarlane’s directorial debut Ted which debuted at number one with an estimated $54.1M from 3,239 theaters for a sizzling $16,705 average. The raunchy buddy comedy about a man and his talking teddy bear scored the third largest opening ever for an R-rated comedy behind two major brand-based hits – The Hangover 2 ($85.9M) and Sex and the City ($56.8M). An original story not based on a well-known brand doing this level of business is incredible and reinforces the starpower of MacFarlane. Actors Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis also added star wattage and positive reviews helped too.The Universal release cost $50M to produce and skewed towards men as expected. Studio research showed that males made up 56% of the crowd while 52% were 30 and older. The CinemaScore grade was a good A-. While distributors only retain a portion of the gross, and marketing costs are additional expenses, it is always good news to a studio when its opening weekend gross is higher than its film’s budget. Friday saw a spectacular $20.7M bow, Saturday dipped 14% to $17.9M, and Universal is optimistically projecting a 13% slide on Sunday to $15.5M. Most other studios are estimating 20-30% declines for their films on Sunday. But with the Independence Day holiday falling on Wednesday and many young adults having extra leisure time this week, Ted should find its way to a solid showing in its first full week even though Tuesday sees the debut of the summer tentpole The Amazing Spider-Man which will start damaging competitors on Monday night when it begins its first midnight shows.Channing Tatum scored his third hit of the year with the much-talked about male stripper movie Magic Mike which opened in second place with an estimated $39.2M from 2,930 locations for a sturdy $13,363 average. Women dominated the audience and business was incredibly front-loaded thanks to girls-night-out crowds that planned opening day outings. Friday premiered to a dazzling $19.4M which eventually accounted for half of all the weekend sales. Saturday tumbled by an alarming 41% to $11.4M while Warner Bros. expects Sunday to dip down 26% to $8.4M.But the promise of beefcake with the likes of the red hot Tatum and co-star Matthew McConaughey was enough to spark excitement and good reviews didn’t hurt either for the Steven Soderbergh-directed drama loosely based on producer/star Tatum’s real-life stint as an exotic dancer. Studio data showed that 73% of the crowd was female and 57% was under 35. The CinemaScore grade was just a mediocre B. 2008’s Sex and the City also saw a massive opening day rush from its audience of adult women. Its Saturday decline was 34% and its female share was 85%. If Magic Mike can hold up and keep attracting customers, it will become Tatum’s third $100M+ grosser in six months. He’s already seen his February romance hit The Vow reach $125M and his March buddy cop comedy 21 Jump Street make $138.3M.Ted and Magic Mike offered a one-two punch of raunchy fun which paying audiences found irresistible as the overall box office broke the record for the biggest June weekend in history beating the last frame of June 2009 which saw the massive launch of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Even more impressive was that the top three films this weekend were not sequels and the top five had no action tentpoles. The R-rated newbies proved that young adults will still come out and pay for original stories that truly excite them.Those looking for clean family-friendly entertainment found it in the Disney/Pixar hit Brave which dropped from first to third place with an estimated $34M. The 49% decline was sizable given how the film is not a sequel and that the new releases provided virtually zero competition. It also pleased crowds on opening weekend earning an encouraging A grade from CinemaScore. Brave has grossed $131.7M in its first ten days and has performed much like Pixar’s 2008 offering WALL?E which debuted in late June to $63.1M, fell 49% in its sophomore session to $32.5M for a ten-day start of $127.2M. Brave had the advantage of some 3D surcharges while the robot pic had the Independence Day holiday help it. With a big holiday week coming up, Brave may find its way to the neighborhood of $235M by the end of its domestic release.Tyler Perry scored yet another hit film with the Lionsgate comedy Madea’s Witness Protection which debuted in fourth with an estimated $26.4M from 2,161 theaters for a potent $12,193 average. The filmmaker’s fourth movie with Madea in the title played to his loyal fan base which continued to come out. This was Perry’s first summer release as most of his offerings went out in the spring or fall. Witness Protection’s debut was in line with the $25.1M bow of the last Madea pic Big Happy Family.Holding up well again in its fourth round was Paramount’s animated sequel Madagascar 3 which collected an estimated $11.8M, off just 40%. The DreamWorks Animation hit has now taken in $180M domestically matching the gross of its 2008 predecessor. Europe’s Most Wanted will surpass the $193.2M of 2005’s original Madagascar next weekend and find itself going past $200M too. International markets saw an estimated $16.2M pushing the overseas haul to $244.2M for a global take of $424M.In its second weekend, the action-horror-history mashup pic Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter suffered a steep 63% tumble to an estimated $6M for $29M in ten days for Fox. Four films rounded out the top ten falling into the $4-5M range. Fox’s sci-fi epic Prometheus took in an estimated $4.9M, down 50%, raising its total to $118.3M. The global haul now stands at $284.8M. Wes Anderson’s indie hit Moonrise Kingdom jumped into the top ten for the first time thanks to an expansion from 395 to 854 theaters with an estimated $4.9M as well. The Focus release averaged $5,706 and has banked an impressive $18.4M to date with much more to come as its cume should double in the coming weeks.Universal’s effects-heavy fairy tale adventure Snow White and the Huntsman dropped 46% to an estimated $4.4M with $145.6M domestic to date. Disney’s uplifting drama People Like Us was dead on arrival in its debut just barely making the top ten with an estimated $4.3M from 2,055 locations for a pitiful $2,095 average. With mixed reviews, the PG-13 pic starring Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks failed to excite any demographic and should fade away quickly.Two big July tentpoles kicked off their global releases this weekend overseas ahead of their U.S. openings. Fox’s animated comedy Ice Age: Continental Drift – the fourth installment in the franchise and second in 3D – debuted to an estimated $78M from 34 markets ranking number one in all of them. In some Latin American markets like Argentina and Columbia it broke the all-time opening weekend box office record. Drift is the latest chapter in a lucrative franchise that has now broken the $2 billion mark this weekend in global box office. Though results in North America have been mostly flat over the years, overseas growth has been mammoth with international grosses soaring from $207M to $461M to a stunning $691M for the last film Dawn of the Dinosaurs which accounted for 78% of its global tally. All signs indicate that interest for the Ice Age franchise – overseas at least – remains quite high. It opens domestically on July 13.Over in Asia and parts of Europe this weekend, Sony’s reboot The Amazing Spider-Man set off fireworks of its own with a $50.2M debut from 13 territories led by Korea’s $13.4M and Japan’s $11.4M. The results were phenomenal with the 3D webslinger crushing the opening for Avengers in both Korea and India by more than 70%. The Andrew Garfield starrer hits U.S. screens this Tuesday one day before the 4th of July holiday. Sam Raimi’s trio of Spider-Man films – all in 2D – grossed a combined $2.5 billion worldwide from 2002 to 2007.After eight long weeks in the domestic top ten, the super hero sensation The Avengers finally dropped from the list finishing in eleventh place with $4.2M and a total of $606.3M from North America and $1.45 billion worldwide. Following in the footsteps of other recent franchises, Sony’s newest alien installment Men in Black 3 will end up as the lowest-grossing pic in the series domestically, but will be the top title globally thanks to growth in international markets for action and 3D films. Will Smith’s comeback vehicle stands at $169.6M from North America and will conclude with $175-180M including 3D surcharges and today’s higher ticket prices. The first two MIB flicks did $250.1M in 1997 and $190.4M in 2002. But the overseas tally on MIB3 rose to $429.8M putting the global take at $599.4M with the $600M barrier ready to fall on Monday. The first Agent J pic sold more tickets but its worldwide gross from fifteen years ago was $589M.Summer moviegoers continued to flock to new independent films as Fox Searchlight’s Sundance award-winner Beasts of the Southern Wild debuted to terrific results in its platform bow in New York and Los Angeles with an estimated $169,000 from four locations for a powerful $42,309 average per theater. Cume since the Wednesday launch was $220,000. It was especially impressive given that it had no stars and was from a first-time director. The critically acclaimed drama adds more markets this week on Wednesday and Friday and then goes much wider on July 13.Woody Allen’s latest European postcard To Rome with Love fared well in its second weekend expansion grossing an estimated $750,000 from 29 playdates (up from five last week) for a $25,862 average. The Sony Classics title has banked $1.3M to date and is scheduled to widen across the country this Friday. With Moonrise Kingdom heading to $35M+ and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel already above $40M, independent films this summer have carved out solid sales from upscale moviegoers interested in movies with more substance in a sea of mindless popcorn flicks.The top ten films grossed an estimated $189.9M which was up 2% from last year when Transformers: Dark of the Moon opened at number one with $97.9M; and up 6% from 2010 when The Twilight Saga: Eclipse debuted on top with $64.8M. Both of those frames were helped by the 4th of July holiday.Folllow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"2015, Arrowverse, Television, movies, cults","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Audiences-Have-Wild-Time-with-Ted-and-Mike"},{"id":"47509124448042","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Expendables Seizes #1 spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Expendables Seizes #1 spotby Gitesh Pandya | August 20, 2012 |  CommentsElderly adrenaline ruled the North American box office as the bullet-filled action sequel The Expendables 2 opened at number one although with less muscle than its predecessor. Three other new films, each targeting a specific segment of the moviegoing public, also debuted and attracted respectable but not stellar grosses. But the variety of content from new and holdover pictures worked together to deliver a strong overall performance as the marketplace was substantially larger than normal for the middle of August with seven different movies breaking double-digit millions over the weekend.Sylvester Stallone rounded up his boys and packed the guns for his latest action offering The Expendables 2 which captured the top spot with an estimated $28.8M opening weekend. The R-rated mega-pack of testosterone and lead averaged a good $8,670 from 3,316 theaters and played to the same older male fan base that powered its 2010 predecessor to a beefier $34.8M bow in mid-August of that summer. The new Lionsgate release tried to add more to the table. Joining returning stars like Jason Statham, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren were action heroes from yesteryear like Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme along with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis who took on bigger roles and more screen time. Stallone did not direct this $90M production as the chair was given to Simon West (Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider).The original Expendables was the first of its kind to combine so many macho action heroes under one roof. But that novelty was gone with the sequel which essentially followed the same formula adding some new faces to the mix for action fans that loved the machine gun flicks of the 1980s. Recent audience sensitivity to guns in the wake of several shootings around the country, and bomb scares at Carmike Cinemas on opening day, may have had some contribution to the 17% drop in opening weekend sales for the latest Expendables installment. But it is impossible to tell how much. Overall marketplace conditions may also have had an impact as every action movie over the past two months has opened either at or below expectations.Demographics were about the same this second time around with males making up 63% of the audience, compared to 61% for the first flick. 65% were 25 or older. For a Stallone action sequel, reviews were actually quite good. And those that paid to see Expendables 2 did like it as the film earned an encouraging A- grade from CinemaScore. The first all-star combo pack went on to gross an impressive $103.1M domestically and $274M worldwide. This one too should rely on overseas audiences to kick in the bulk of the cash.Rival August action pic The Bourne Legacy settled for second place and took a sequel-like fall of 55% to an estimated $17M. Universal has banked $69.6M in its first ten days for the new Jeremy Renner installment in the spy series. The last two Matt Damon films did slightly better in their second weekends with declines of 53% for 2007’s The Bourne Ultimatum and 54% for 2004’s The Bourne Supremacy although those were at or above the $100M mark by the sophomore session. Look for Legacy to end its run with roughly $115M as it joins this summer’s latest chapters for Spider-Man, Ice Age, Step Up, and Men in Black as the lowest-grossing installment domestically of its franchise.Focus gave a big launch to its 3D toon ParaNorman and scored a third place debut with an estimated $14M from a very wide 3,429 locations for a mild $4,085 average. The PG-rated stop-motion flick about a young boy who sees ghosts won rave reviews from film critics and had to compete with multiple other choices for kids from Disney and Fox. The CinemaScore was a respectable B+. With nothing new for youngsters next weekend, ParaNorman hopes to keep playing to its target audience until schools reopen for the new academic year.Will Ferrell’s political comedy The Campaign dropped 50% in the polls and collected an estimated $13.4M in its second term boosting the ten-day tally to $51.7M. The Warner Bros. release should end its run with about $85M which would be a solid result for an R-rated comedy.Sony’s summer recycling program of sequels, reboots, and remakes continued with the musical drama Sparkle which debuted in fifth with an estimated $12M from 2,244 theaters for a decent $5,348 average. Starring American Idol champ Jordin Sparks and the late Whitney Houston in her final role, the PG-13 film played overwhelmingly to an older female crowd as studio research showed that the audience was 74% female and 62% over the age of 35. A remake of the classic film from 1976, Sparkle earned mixed reviews from critics but truly won over paying audiences. Its CinemaScore grade was a solid A. But despite that high score, sales slipped on Saturday and the overall weekend average was not as high as those for many other films aimed at mature African-American women. Direct competition is minimal over the next couple of weeks so it may have a chance to hold up giving the low cost $14M production a profitable run.Super hero juggernaut The Dark Knight Rises fell out of the top five in its fifth frame with an estimated $11.1M, off a respectable 41%. The Warner Bros. threequel smashed the $400M mark on Friday in its 29th day of release and has upped its domestic total to $409.9M allowing Bane and his goons to climb up to number 12 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters passing the $407.7M of last spring’s blockbuster The Hunger Games. A sensational $58.8M of the Batgross has come from IMAX locations. Overseas, Rises rose up to $487.8M surpassing the $469.7M lifetime international gross of The Dark Knight while stabilizing its decline to 42%. The worldwide haul now stands at $897.7M with Greece, Italy, and the key Chinese market still to open over the next two weeks.Opening in seventh place was the tween dramedy The Odd Life of Timothy Green with an estimated $10.9M over the weekend and $15.2M over the five days since its Wednesday launch. The PG-rated film averaged a lukewarm $4,199 from 2,598 sites over three days and played mostly to moms and kids. Families made up 53% of the crowd while females were 68%. Reviews were not too good but moviegoers were satisfied with their experience as the Disney pic earned an A- from CinemaScore. Opening head-to-head against ParaNorman certainly split some of the family crowd which already had other brand-based options to choose from.Sony’s older-skewing comedy Hope Springs with Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones held up well in its second weekend as expected slipping 38% to an estimated $9.1M for a ten-day total of $35.1M. A final of $60-70M could result. Fox’s kid sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days tumbled 52% to an estimated $3.9M while Sony’s remake Total Recall rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.5M falling a steep 56%. Cumes stand at $38.8M and $51.8M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $123.7M which was up 27% from last year when The Help climbed into the number one spot in its second weekend with $20M; and up 21% from 2010 when The Expendables remained on top with $17M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"competition, Pet, impossible, fresh, watch, Reviews, space","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Expendables-Seizes-1-spot"},{"id":"47509126047549","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hunger Games Still #1, Breaks $250M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hunger Games Still #1, Breaks $250Mby Gitesh Pandya | April 2, 2012 |  CommentsDespite a big drop, the teen-killing-teen epic The Hunger Games remained the most popular film leading the box office with more ticket sales in its second frame than the two new releases combined. The 3D action sequel Wrath of the Titans debuted in second place while the Snow White pic Mirror Mirror opened in third leading the marketplace to another sizable lead over year-ago levels.Falling a large but understandable 60% from its record bow, The Hunger Games scored another $61.1M this weekend, according to estimates, propelling the ten-day cume to an eye-popping $251M. That allowed the Lionsgate release to break Avatar’s record for the fastest non-sequel to break the quarter-billion mark. The Na’vi pic needed 12 days in December 2009 including the Christmas frame whereas Hunger had no holiday help. In fact, only three films in box office history have ever reached the milestone faster – The Dark Knight in eight days as well as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen which both did it in nine days. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest did it in ten days. All four were July releases when weekday numbers were much stronger thanks to students being out of school and the Potter figures included a boost from 3D surcharges.The fact that Games could collect so much in such a short period of time outside of summer is nothing short of incredible. Overall, it was the seventh best performance for any film in its sophomore weekend and fourth biggest among non-sequels behind Avatar ($75.6M), Spider-Man ($71.4M), and Alice in Wonderland ($62.7M). Among second weekends, Hunger beat out every installment of the Harry Potter and Twilight franchises although the first wizard flick sold more tickets in its Thanksgiving-boosted sophomore round.Katniss and pals saw a daily breakdown of $18.9M on Friday, $25M on Saturday (up 33%), and $17.3M on Sunday (-31%). At its current trajectory, the final domestic tally should reach the vicinity of $375M. Hunger Games just may stay at number one for a third weekend in a row as next weekend it will face the blast-from-the-past debuts of American Reunion in 3,200 locations and the 3D re-release of Titanic which sets sail on Wednesday in 2,500 sites. The Good Friday holiday should keep Games above the $30M mark in its third round putting the $300M barrier within reach by Easter Sunday after 17 days.Overseas, The Hunger Games saw a 41% decline to an estimated $34.8M lifting the international total to $113.9M and the worldwide cume to $364.9M. Top market cumes are $17M in Australia, $13.1M in the U.K., and $11.3M from Russia. A final global gross near $600M is possible for the $75M production.Opening in second place was the big-budget 3D action sequel Wrath of the Titans with an estimated $34.2M representing a sharp 44% fall from the $61.2M of its predecessor Clash of the Titans this weekend two years ago. The PG-13 Greek God pic averaged $9,647 from 3,545 theaters and saw an impressive 14% of the gross come from its 292 IMAX screens and 65% from all 3D venues (including IMAX). Clash, a remake of the 1981 film of the same name, was a massive box office hit grossing $163.2M domestically and $493M worldwide. However, its 3D conversion was widely panned as the film was conceptualized to be in 2D and was only converted at the last minute in order to generate higher grosses in the post-Avatar era. Many who came out and were disappointed in Clash skipped out on Wrath this time. Still, not many action films open north of $30M in the March-April corridor and this one is more intended for a global audience. The breakdown saw no surprises as males made up 66% of the crowd while 55% were over 25. Reviews were mostly negative and audiences gave a decent B+ grade from CinemaScore.Overseas and worldwide, Wrath of the Titans stole the number one spot from Hunger Games. A massive launch across 60 markets resulted in a weekend bow of $78M for a worldwide opening weekend of $112.2M. With Hollywood’s action and 3D titles performing extremely well overseas, and Wrath having a non-American setting and international cast, Warner Bros. is hoping to keep the grosses going over the coming weeks. Easter holidays will give students and adults extra time off too so more potential lies ahead. Red hot Russia led the way with $14M with China estimated to follow as second biggest although exact figures were not available because of holidays. Mexico ranked third with a $5M debut and Japan, the only major territory to not open this weekend, launches three weeks from now.The fairy tale adventure Mirror Mirror starring Julia Roberts landed in third place with an estimated $19M in its first weekend in theaters. The PG-rated telling of the Snow White story averaged a respectable $5,273 from 3,603 and played to a more female-skewing family audience. Studio data showed that the audience was three-fourths female and 63% 25 and older. Produced for over $80M, the lavish fantasy pic earned mixed reviews from critics and a moderate B+ grade from CinemaScore. With the top two films in the country featuring high death counts, and The Lorax having been out for a month now, families with younger children found Mirror Mirror to be the only major game in town. Boys, not surprisingly, were hard to reach. Though the opening weekend was not exceptionally high, the long-term outlook is encouraging since many schools will be closed over the next two weeks for spring breaks and Easter holidays plus direct competition will be light.Still pleasing the crowds was the action-comedy 21 Jump Street which slipped only 27% to an estimated $15M giving Sony $93.1M to date on its way to the century club by the end of the week. Soon to join the double century club, Universal’s hit 3D toon The Lorax grossed $8M, down 39%, for a $189.6M cume to date. The big-budget actioner John Carter continued its rapid descent falling 61% to an estimated $2M for a total of only $66.2M to date. The Disney pic has suffered declines of 55-63% each weekend.The British fly-fishing drama Salmon Fishing in the Yemen expanded again in its fourth week of play and jumped into the top ten at number seven with an estimated $1.3M. Averaging a mild $2,638 from 483 locations, the CBS Films title took advantage of weak grosses from current holdovers to make it so high on the chart. Before Hunger Games arrived last week, no film all year made it into the top ten with less than $2M on the weekend. This weekend there were five films at or below that level. Salmon’s sum stands at $3.2M.The low-budget Navy SEAL flick Act of Valor followed with an estimated $1M, off 51%, for $67.7M for Relativity. Eddie Murphy’s latest flop A Thousand Words has amazingly spent four straight weeks in the top ten. The Paramount release took in an estimated $915,000, down 53%, for a weak cume of only $16.5M. Rounding out the top ten with only $835,000, according to estimates, was the adventure sequel Journey 2: The Mysterious Island which has banked $98.5M so far.The critically acclaimed documentary Bully got off to a good start in platform release opening to an estimated $115,000 from only five theaters in New York and Los Angeles for a solid $23,000 average. The figure included a very optimistic 15% Saturday-to-Sunday dip as reported by The Weinstein Co. so the final gross may end up somewhat lower. Manufacturing a controversy out of its R rating led to plenty of nationwide publicity which helped fuel ticket sales. Harvey and company similarly spun PR gold out of their unsuccessful MPAA appeal for Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004 which smashed box office records for docs. Although all kids can be admitted to an R-rated film as long as they are accompanied by someone 17 or older, the campaign pushed the notion that students were being deprived from getting an important message because of the MPAA. The fight-the-system plan worked wonders connecting to the activism element in the target audience. Bully expands Friday to six more markets including San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston.The top ten films grossed an estimated $143.3M which was up 30% from last year when Hop opened in the top spot with $37.5M; but down 14% from 2010 when Clash of the Titans debuted at number one with $61.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"best, 2019, stand-up, Starz, spanish, diversity, King","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hunger-Games-Still-1-Breaks-250M"},{"id":"47509124485942","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Avengers‘ Reign Continues","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Avengers' Reign ContinuesIn other news, people like blood sausage too.by Gitesh Pandya | May 21, 2012 |  CommentsDominating the box office for a third weekend in a row and turning all competitors into casualties of war, The Avengers held on firmly to the number one spot breaking more records in the process. Audiences were not very excited about the new releases as the big-budget action tentpole Battleship suffered a poor opening in second place, the Sacha Baron Cohen comedy The Dictator failed to match the raunchy funnyman’s past performances, and the all-star pregnancy comedy What to Expect When You’re Expecting debuted in fifth with weak results. It was the first time in fourteen years that the normally-busy weekend before the Memorial Day holiday frame failed to deliver any $35M+ openings causing the top ten to fall below both last year’s and 2010’s levels.The shawarma-loving super heroes continued to rule the box office as The Avengers grossed an estimated $55.1M in its third weekend on top, dropping a reasonable 47%. Disney’s Marvel juggernaut has now amassed an eye-popping $457.1M in 17 days and broke two more speed records breaking $400M in 14 days and $450M after 17. The Dark Knight held both of those milestones before with 18 and 27 days, respectively. The S.H.I.E.L.D. team zoomed up to number six on the list of all-time-domestic blockbusters sitting right behind the $461M lifetime of Star Wars with a final North American take of near $600M likely.Moviegoers have been loving Avengers and really have not been moved by all the other offerings that Hollywood has programmed into May. Studios knew that it would be a heavy hitter so they avoided slotting in any high-profile sequels into the first three weeks of its run for fear of being crushed. But the Iron Man-led film opened much stronger than expected and has been holding up very well utterly dominating the movie conversation and reaching beyond the core fan base of comic book geeks.Avengers enjoyed the second largest third weekend gross in history trailing only the $68.5M of Avatar which had help from the New Year’s holiday that frame. Both films enjoyed a boost from 3D surcharges although more of those screens are installed now. 2002’s Spider-Man grossed $45M ten years ago this weekend while in its third session but actually sold about 30% more tickets than Avengers. 2008’s The Dark Knight grossed $42.7M which was about even with Avengers in terms of tickets sold on the third weekend. The Batpic enjoyed a slightly better hold with its 43% decline.With Avengers grossing so much, industry eyes will shift to the highly-anticipated The Dark Knight Rises which opens July 20. Being a 2D film, it’s not expected to break the $207.4M record opening of Avengers. However, with stronger midweek grosses when students are out of school in July, its final tally could challenge the Marvel team’s especially if it can hold up like its predecessor. While the gross is unprecedented, the Avengers audience size is not record-setting. Four years ago, Dark Knight pulled in $393.8M in its first 17 days which would equate to roughly $440M at today’s 2D prices. Factor in 3D surcharges and the rough admissions totals would be 55 million for Dark Knight and 50 million for Avengers. Of course, Rises will not have the Heath Ledger factor but the good will created by the last Knight will certainly pay dividends this July.Overseas, The Avengers banked another $56M in its fourth round for a $111.1M global weekend. The international cume has rocketed to $723.3M bringing the worldwide tally to a staggering $1.18 billion putting it at number four on the all-time global list right behind Avatar, Titanic, and the final Harry Potter. In another week or so, Nick Fury and pals will beat the Hogwarts clan and settle into what should be its final resting place with a bronze box office medal. Leading markets continue to be the U.K. ($72.3M), China ($69.3M), Mexico ($56.2M), and Brazil ($51.9M). Avengers has become the top-grossing movie of all-time for Disney which expects more cash to come from future films from Marvel which it owns.Universal suffered a pricey misfire with the big-budget action film Battleship which just didn’t connect with moviegoers. Costing at least $209M to produce with no other studios sharing the financial risk, the PG-13 naval adventure opened to only $25.4M, according to estimates, with an average of only $6,870 from 3,690 theaters. It would barely be a respectable performance for a film costing half as much. Audiences in the mood for a large-scale effects-driven action picture had Avengers to see – even if it was for a second time – and Battleship just did not stand out as a must-see film.Critics and audiences were not too thrilled with what Battleship delivered. Reviews were mixed but more on the downbeat side while patrons polled by CinemaScore gave the film a mediocre B grade. As expected, the alien attack film loosely based on the alien-less board game skewed towards men as studio research showed that 57% of the crowd was male while 55% was 30 or older. An aggressive marketing campaign including Super Bowl spots failed to excite audiences who felt that the pic basically looked like Transformers at sea without Michael Bay at the helm. The cast included Liam Neeson, pop singer Rihanna, Brooklyn Decker, and Taylor Kitsch who after John Carter now enjoys the distinction of starring in the year’s two biggest flops. The more expensive Carter opened to $30.2M including 3D surcharges and has stalled at $283M worldwide for Disney.Battleship set sail over a month ago in international waters where it found more success. Entering most markets at least two weeks before Avengers it was able to scoop up a decent amount of cash before getting pummeled by a superior action film. This weekend saw an estimated $6.5M bumping the offshore take to $226.8M and the global sum to $252.1M. But given its current grosses and the calendar ahead, the worldwide figure looks to finish in the neighborhood of $325M which will be a big disappointment given the massive production and marketing investments which add up to nearly the same amount.Also underperforming and costing a lot (for its genre) was Sacha Baron Cohen’s latest comedy vehicle The Dictator which bowed to an estimated $17.4M over the weekend and $24.5M since debuting on Wednesday. The three-day average was $5,790 from 3,008 locations. Over five days, the R-rated film grossed less than the three-day openings of the last two films the funnyman anchored. 2006’s sleeper hit Borat opened to $26.5M from just 837 theaters while 2009’s Brüno bowed to $30.6M from 2,756 locations. Both R-rated comedies landed at number one and were based on popular characters that Cohen had developed on his television series. Dictator brought some of the same brand of raunchy satire to a new character, an eccentric tyrant that ruled a fictitious North African oil-rich nation.Reviews were generally good, however audiences were not pleased with what they paid for as the Paramount release earned a troubling C grade from CinemaScore. Brüno scored the same grade and quickly eroded away at the box office tumbling 73% in its sophomore frame. Cohen has been promoting his film in character on numerous talk shows and at prestigious film events like the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Awards in an attempt to make his product stand out as something buzzworthy. But American audiences may be getting tired of the same humor from the British comedian. And the budget of $65M was high for a comedy not driven by special effects or having a proven star like Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell.Studio research showed that a steep 65% of the crowd was male and 56% was under 25. The Dictator had extremely limited female appeal and males had two huge effects-driven action films to go and see so competition took its toll. Political comedies usually skew older but Cohen’s bold humor led to a young adult crowd taking interest. But with low customer satisfaction ratings and Men in Black 3 opening Friday, the domestic road ahead looks grim.However, The Dictator fared well elsewhere in the world. The Wadiya pic debuted to an estimated $30.3M overseas from 29 markets – most of which are not among the world’s top-grossing territories – taking the number one spot in 25 of them. Cohen’s home market of the U.K. led with $7.2M over five days followed by Australia with $5.7M in five days. Both opened smaller than Brüno, though. Germany debuted to $4.5M which was bigger than the fashionista pic. The underwhelming American response may end up meaning little in the long run if international markets continue to embrace the film and perform well. With $54.8M globally in its first extended weekend, and France, Italy and Japan still to come over the months ahead, The Dictator seems positioned to recover its costs.Johnny Depp and Tim Burton saw their fans flee this weekend as their latest project Dark Shadows tumbled 57% in its sophomore round to an estimated $12.8M. Word-of-mouth has not been very good for the pricey film which cost an estimated $150M+ to produce. Warner Bros. has collected a disappointing $50.9M in ten days and looks headed for a $70-75M domestic finish putting tremendous pressure on international markets to deliver. Overseas, Shadows grossed an estimated $30.4M this weekend from 52 markets including a $5M debut in Japan boosting the international cume to $81.3M and the worldwide gross to $132.2M.Lionsgate tried to offer counter-programming for adult women not interested in testosterone action tentpoles by releasing the all-star pregnancy comedy What to Expect When You’re Expecting but was met with modest results. The PG-13 film starring Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez, Elizabeth Banks, Chris Rock, Dennis Quaid, and Brooklyn Decker in her second new film of the weekend bowed to an estimated $10.5M from 3,021 theaters for a sluggish $3,476 average. Reviews were more negative than positive but often times with these comedies starpower can trump bad buzz from critics. That wasn’t the case here. With men being repelled by the subject matter, Johnny Depp taking in more money from adult women, and Avengers still sucking up all business from broad audiences, What to Expect failed to generate much excitement with its intended audience despite being based on a best-selling book. A B- CinemaScore for the $30M film indicates that the film should exit theaters soon.The indie comedy The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel expanded once again by doubling its run from 178 to 354 theaters and climbed up two spots to number six with an estimated $3.3M. The Fox Searchlight release averaged a solid $9,181 per location raising its total to $8.2M. Hotel is connecting with a crowd not interested in big studio tentpoles (all films above it on the chart are playing in 3000+ theaters) and is carving out its own piece of the box office pie. The ensemble hit will go nationwide on Friday for the long Memorial Day holiday frame reaching more than 1,100 playdates.Lionsgate’s franchise flick The Hunger Games held up well again dropping only 33% to an estimated $3M putting the stellar cume at $391.6M as it inches closer to the quadruple-century mark. Sony’s hit comedy Think Like a Man followed with an estimated $2.7M, off 54%, for a $85.9M cume.Falling 57% was the romance The Lucky One with an estimated $1.8M while Sony’s 3D toon The Pirates! Band of Misfits dropped 54% to an estimated $1.5M. Totals stand at $56.9M and $25.4M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $133.3M which was down 15% from last year when Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides opened at number one with $90.2M; and down 6% from 2010 when Shrek Forever After debuted on top with $70.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"razzies, theme, rom-coms, nbcuniversal, fresh, anime, festival, Lifetime, Plus","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Avengers-Reign-Continues"},{"id":"47509126055744","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Lorax Holds on to Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Lorax Holds on to Top SpotPlus, John Carter trails behind, and Silent House takes #4.by Gitesh Pandya | March 12, 2012 |  CommentsThis weekend, Hollywood studios suffered failures of every kind with their new releases. The pricey actioner John Carter debuted in second place putting it far from where it needed to be to recover its enormous costs, the horror entry Silent House scored the lowest audience grade of the year, and Eddie Murphy’s latest comedy A Thousand Words earned the worst reviews of 2012 from film critics. Instead, moviegoers once again made the animated comedy The Lorax the most popular film in North America and the overall box office continued to beat out last year’s levels, although by a narrow margin.Easily leading all movies in the marketplace, Universal held onto the number one spot with the Dr. Seuss toon The Lorax which slipped an acceptable 44% to an estimated $39.1M. The PG-rated hit averaged a sensational $10,430 in its second weekend from 3,746 theaters and continues to play to families and beyond. 3D and IMAX ticket prices have helped along the way and on Sunday, Lorax became the highest-grossing film of 2012 after just ten days of release with a cume of $122M. Breaking the $200M barrier should be no problem for the $70M production.Landing in second place in its opening weekend was the mega-budgeted 3D sci-fi epic John Carter with an estimated $30.6M from 3,749 theaters for a $8,163 average. The gross itself was not all that bad for a sci-fi actioner releasing at this time of year. But it was far from what was needed to make a project with such a mammoth cost become a financial winner. Conservative estimates put the production cost alone at $250M while some industry insiders put it higher. Add in a lavish global marketing and distribution push and the total cost to make and release this PG-13 adventure came to nearly $400M. That eye-popping level is often reached by Hollywood tentpoles but with known brands like Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, and Harry Potter which result in billion-dollar global grossers. Last summer saw all three of those franchises come out with their first-ever 3D installments and each reached ten digits at the worldwide box office.Disney’s risky investment featured Pixar guru Andrew Stanton directing his first live-action film after his wildly successful toons Finding Nemo and WALL-E. The source material was a century-old novel which is cherished only in the hardcore sci-fi world and virtually unknown elsewhere. Reviews were mixed at best and the trailers and TV spots failed to generate much excitement with a broader action audience. Females had incredibly low interest and there was no starpower to pull in mainstream crowds. Overall, John Carter from the start had little in its arsenal to become a giant hit making the insanely large budget hard to justify.Of course, international markets drive global box office and 3D action films are tops among those that work well overseas so the studio is counting on moviegoers around the world to show up. Carter‘s international debut was indeed impressive with an estimated $70.6M this weekend from 51 markets. All major territories bowed day and date except for China and Japan which are sure to contribute solid numbers in the months ahead.In North America, John Carter played mostly to adult men. Studio research showed that 63% was male and 59% was over 25. IMAX 3D represented 16% of the gross ($4.9M) and overall, 64% ($19.6M) came from 3D screens which was an encouraging ratio by today’s standards. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+. Friday kicked off slowly with $9.8M while Saturday enjoyed a healthy 25% boost. Sunday is estimated to drop by only 31% to $8.5M.Other effects-driven action films released in the spring have opened in the $30M range like 10,000 BC ($35.9M), Constantine ($29.8M), The Scorpion King ($36.1M), and Jumper ($27.4M). However, none carried the towering budget of John Carter and none had 3D surcharges. Disney even released its red planet pic Mission to Mars this very weekend in 2000 to the tune of $22.9M which at today’s 2D ticket prices would put it ahead of Carter. Last year this weekend, the studio had a costly bomb with Mars Needs Moms which bowed to a pitiful $6.9M weekend and $2,218 average. Chances are the company will stay away from opening Mars movies in March for the time being.Those young men that didn’t show up for the Mars flick were busy partying it up with the raunchy comedy Project X which held up surprisingly well in its second weekend with an estimated $11.6M representing a 45% decline. With a Friday-to-Saturday drop on opening weekend and lackluster exit polls, the Warner Bros. title was expected to fall harder the way these types of films do. Instead, the target audience was uninterested in the three new offerings and showed up for this one which has now banked $40.1M in just ten days. Project X cost only $12M to produce and should finish with a promising $65M or so, joining Chronicle and The Devil Inside as low-cost found-footage pics that scored big bucks this year from young adult audiences.Audiences hated the ending and gave a dismal F CinemaScore grade to the new horror pic Silent House which debuted in a tie for fourth place with an estimated $7M. The Open Road release averaged a weak $3,300 from 2,124 locations and saw no growth in sales on Saturday from opening day. The R-rated chiller starring Elizabeth Olsen as a young woman terrorized in her family cabin earned mixed reviews but featured a twist ending that ticket buyers were not at all entertained by. CinemaScore grades are often affected by the mood that polled moviegoers are in immediately after walking out of a theater so many vote on how satisfied they were with the final parts of the film. Devil Inside from January also met with an F before collapsing 76% in the second weekend.Also collecting an estimated $7M this weekend was former number one Act of Valor which fell by 48% which was the largest decline in the top ten. Relativity has taken in a stellar $56.1M for the low-budget action film.Eddie Murphy’s latest career embarrassment came in the form of his new comedy A Thousand Words which tanked in its debut grossing only $6.4M, according to estimates. The Paramount release about a fast-talking agent that must refrain from speaking or else he will die (yes, that’s the plot) failed to excite moviegoers and averaged a weak $3,360 from 1,890 theaters. The PG-13 film was eviscerated by critics and had the rare distinction of earning a Rotten Tomatoes score of 0%. Postponed for years, the DreamWorks production cost $40M to produce.If there was any good news for Murphy it was that Words beat the openings of his recent box office disasters Meet Dave and Imagine That — both PG-rated summer pics — which bowed to $5.2M and $5.5M, respectively. This would be the only thing that could count as good news. The audience breakdown was 55% female and 61% 25 and older while the CinemaScore was a B-.Universal’s action hit Safe House followed with an estimated $5M, off 33%, for a $115.8M cume with solid legs going into its fifth frame. The Sony smash The Vow also held up well dropping only 34% to an estimated $4M raising the total to $117.6M. Channing Tatum aims for his second number one hit in as many months with Friday’s release of 21 Jump Street.Reese Witherspoon’s action-romance This Means War is another film that audiences continue to flock to. The Fox title wasn’t super strong out of the gate but has been posting good holds each week. This weekend saw a 33% dip to an estimated $3.8M lifting the sum to $46.9M. Yet another action title followed as Journey 2: The Mysterious Island collected an estimated $3.7M, off 44%, giving the Warner Bros. sequel $90.7M to date.A pair of indie films enjoyed solid results in their limited debuts. The relationship comedy Friends With Kids opened in 374 theaters and landed in the number 13 spot nationwide with an estimated $2.2M and a good $5,799 average which was third best in the entire Top 20. Starring Maya Rudolph, Kristin Wiig, and Jon Hamm, the R-rated film from Roadside Attractions earned mostly positive reviews.The Ewan McGregor-Emily Blunt pic Salmon Fishing in the Yemen opened in just 18 locations but took in an estimated $240,000 for a solid $13,333 average. Reviews were generally good for the CBS Films release which played to older women as exit polls showed that the audience was 61% female and 71% over 50. Yemen widens in existing markets Friday and then expands to new markets on the following weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $118M which was up 5% from last year when Battle: Los Angeles opened in the top spot with $35.6M; but down 9% from 2010 when Alice in Wonderland remained at number one with $62.7M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"hidden, Games, singing, Awards, watch, to, Video, MTV, elm, Comics, films","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Lorax-Holds-on-to-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509126038330","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Think Like a Man Is New #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Think Like a Man Is New #1Plus, The Lucky One takes #2, and The Hunger Games finally falls.by Gitesh Pandya | April 23, 2012 |  CommentsThis weekend, proving for the umpteenth time that African American casts can bring in the big bucks, Sony’s Think Like a Man exploded into the top spot at the box office while the romance of The Lucky One debuted solidly in second. Both films knocked 4-time champ The Hunger Games from the top slot.Based on the bestselling book by Steve Harvey, Think Like a Man dominated the box office with a stellar $33M opening this weekend, according to estimates, for a powerful $16,377 per screen average. Starring Michael Ealy, Regina Hall, Kevin Hart and Taraji P. Henson (amongst others), the film managed to make back its entire production budget (approximately $12M) in its first day in theaters. The industry should no longer be surprised when a film starring a primarily African American cast proves successful at the box office, but instead should be asking why more of them aren’t made. There is obviously a large audience ready to devour these films. Reviews were mixed but audiences dug what they saw, giving the film an A grade at CinemaScore. This was also the fourth number one film of the year for Sony, following Underworld: Awakening, The Vow and 21 Jump Street.Debuting in second place was the latest film adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel, The Lucky One which brought in an estimated $22.8M this weekend, for a per screen average of $7,228. As expected, the film played mostly to young women, with an audience breakdown of 76% female, and 52% under the age of 25. Reviews were mostly poor, but people who are suckers for romance didn’t care as the film garnered a CinemaScore grade of a B+.Making it a book-to-film trifecta, following its four-week reign at the top — the first film since Avatar to do that — the spring juggernaut The Hunger Games continued to pull in solid business by sliding only 31% to an estimated $14.5M in its fifth round. The Lionsgate smash upped its cume to a staggering $356.9M allowing Katniss and pals to rise up to number 19 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters just ahead of the $352.4M of last summer’s 3D threequel Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The next films to fall to the icy stare of Katniss will be Jurassic Park ($357M), and then Jesus himself in The Passion of the Christ ($370.8M).Disney’s yearly Earth Day documentary Chimpanzee opened nicely at number four this weekend with an estimated $10.2M. The film opened higher than the Earth Day films from the past three years which included Earth in 2009 ($8.8M opening/$32M total), 2010’s Oceans ($6M/$19.4M) and last year’s African Cats ($6M/$15.4M). I fully expect next year for Disney to hit their pinnacle with a documentary on puppies and kittens putting the past behind them and living together in harmony.The Three Stooges stumbled to fifth place dropping 46% to an estimated $9M giving Fox $29M after ten days. Look for a final gross in the $45M range for Larry, Moe and Curly (but not Shemp). Falling 47% in its sophomore round was the horror flick The Cabin in the Woods with an estimated $7.7M for a $27M ten-day cume for Lionsgate. Look for a finale in the $40M range. Universal’s comedy fourquel American Reunion collected an estimated $5.2M, off 50%, and has lifted its tally to $48M, which is about what American Pie 2 made in its opening weekend nearly 11 years ago.James Cameron’s Titanic 3D fell a steep 58% to an estimated $5M and has collected $53M for Paramount during this run. Somehow I don’t imagine Cameron or the studio feel too badly about the dip as the lifetime total now stands at $653M. Sony’s hit comedy 21 Jump Street fared well again dropping only 30% to an estimated $4.6M for an impressive $127M take to date. The stylish fairy tale adventure Mirror Mirror declined by 40% grossing an estimated $4.1M for a $55M sum.The top ten films grossed an estimated $116M which was up 1.6% from last when Rio stayed in the top spot with $26.3M; and up 35.6% from 2010 when How To Train Your Dragon reclaimed number one with $15.4M in its fifth frame.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"IFC, Fox, composers, Network","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Think-Like-a-Man-Is-New-1"},{"id":"47509124480821","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Men in Black III Dethrones The Avengers","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Men in Black III Dethrones The AvengersThreequel debuts on top for the four-day weekend, albeit to lower attendance than its predecessors.by Gitesh Pandya | May 28, 2012 |  CommentsWill Smith made his long-awaited return to multiplexes and seized the number one spot at the North American box office with his new sci-fi sequel Men in Black 3 which booted The Avengers down to second place in its fourth weekend. But fewer people came out to greet the 3D alien comedy compared to the two previous installments prompting the top ten to fall by a troubling 31% from last year’s four-day Memorial Day holiday session.Sony topped the box office with Men in Black 3 which opened to an estimated $70M over the long Friday-to-Monday weekend and an estimated $55M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion. Boosted by higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screens, the PG-13 film averaged $12,947 over three days and $16,478 over four days from an ultrawide 4,248 theaters. Comparisons to the first two Men in Black films are uneven since those both debuted mid-week ahead of the Fourth of July holiday frames. Plus they did not have 3D surcharges and ticket prices were significantly lower back in 1997 for the original film and 2002 for the first sequel. Still, those Friday-to-Sunday debuts were $51.1M and $52.1M respectively indicating a big drop in admissions this time around for the aging franchise.Reviews were fairly good for MIB3 which reunited Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and director Barry Sonnenfeld with Josh Brolin added to the cast of the new time-travel story. The production cost is estimated to be $230M which is to be expected for a star-driven threequel. Smith has not had a film since the flop Seven Pounds from December 2008 and has not had a number one hit, or any action movie, since Hancock from July 2008. The new alien pic earned a good B+ grade from CinemaScore.Rejuvenating a franchise after a decade-long absence was a challenge as was attracting audiences when The Avengers is doing so well with action-hungry moviegoers. The four-day opening does not even rank among the top ten best Memorial Day weekend debuts despite the help from 3D prices. Historically, sequels debuting over this holiday are very front-loaded putting Agents J and K on course to finish their third domestic trip in the $150-175M range which would be the lowest tally of the trilogy.Sony reported that Men in Black opened at number one in 104 international territories this weekend too with an overseas bow of $133.2M and global launch of $203.2M. A series of red carpet premieres in Asia and Europe helped to drive excitement with the leading markets being China ($19.5M), Russia ($18.9M), Korea ($8.5M), and Japan ($8M). Thanks to growth overseas since the last MIB, domestic shortfalls could be made up from strong international sales.Dropping out of the number one spot didn’t stop The Avengers from racking up more impressive numbers and breaking additional records. The assembly of super heroes took in an estimated $46.9M in its fourth weekend with the three-day portion of $36.8M declining by only 34% making for a terrific hold as holiday moviegoers caught up on the most-talked-about movie of the year. With “see it again” ads hitting the marketplace for the long weekend, movie fans of all types are responding by seeing a blockbuster film that delivers the escapist entertainment people are looking for.After 25 days, the amazing cume shot up to $523.6M and broke the half-billion domestic mark on Saturday in a record 23 days. Avatar previously held that record with 32 days so this was quite a fast achievement. Avengers is now on track to surpass The Dark Knight’s $533.3M by next weekend to take over the number three spot on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters trailing the James Cameron double feature.International crowds are still coming out spending an estimated $28.1M this weekend in the fifth round boosting the overseas haul to $781.9M and the global gross to $1.305 billion. Currently the fourth biggest worldwide grosser, the Marvel gang will soon surpass Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 to take the number three spot on a global basis too. Avengers may just end its run with close to $1.5 billion. Pleasing movie fans everywhere, the Disney juggernaut has been sucking the life out of the worldwide box office for a month now.Following its weak launch, the mega-priced action tentpole Battleship just could not stay relevant with moviegoers and plunged 57% over the Friday-to-Sunday period to an estimated $10.9M which was a sizable drop given that Sunday was stronger than usual with a holiday following it. The four-day weekend was $13.8M. After 11 days, the board game pic has grossed only $47.3M and is on course to end its domestic run with a very disappointing $70M or so. With a production cost of at least $209M, that just isn’t what the studio needed to turn it into a moneymaker, much less a franchise. Sandwiched in between Avengers and MIB3, Battleship did not become a must-see action pic for summer audiences this month. Overseas grosses rose slightly to $232.7M putting the worldwide total at $283M which is still lower than what a costly project like this needed. The final global tally won’t go too much higher than $300M.The Dictator, another big May offering from Hollywood that isn’t exciting too many ticket buyers, fell in its second weekend to an estimated $11.8M over the long weekend putting the 13-day sum at $43.6M. Paramount will struggle to get its final domestic gross to match the $65M production cost. Overseas audiences also fled from the Sacha Baron Cohen political satire with an estimated $11.8M from 29 international markets, down 53%. With $50.3M from outside of North America, Dictator’s worldwide total rose to $94M. Johnny Depp’s vampire comedy Dark Shadows followed with an estimated $9.4M across four days for a total of only $64.9M for the expensive Warner Bros. release.The new horror pic Chernobyl Diaries opened poorly with an estimated $9.3M over the long weekend from 2,433 theaters for a slow $3,822 average over four days. Audiences instantly disliked the Warner Bros. film as Saturday sales tumbled 33% from the opening day with the CinemaScore grade being a horrible D+. Fright films rarely succeed in the month of May when much bigger summer popcorn movies are rolling out for young adult audiences.Lionsgate’s underperforming all-star comedy What to Expect When You’re Expecting dipped to an estimated $8.9M and has collected just $23.9M in 11 days. Expanding nationwide, Fox Searchlight’s indie hit The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel climbed up to an estimated $8.2M over four days doubling its weekend gross after widening to 1,233 locations. The British pic averaged $6,671 per location and has banked $18.4M so far.The blockbuster The Hunger Games placed ninth with an estimated $2.9M remaining a popular choice for fans in its tenth weekend. With $395.9M to date, the Lionsgate smash looks set to break the $400M mark. Sony’s hit comedy Think Like a Man rounded out the top ten with an estimated $1.8M over four days for a $88.7M total.Focus generated a spectacular platform debut for Wes Anderson’s latest film Moonrise Kingdom which opened in just four theaters with an estimated $669,000 over four days for a jaw-dropping average of $167,372. Generating buzz from its opening night slot at the Cannes Film Festival, the quirky dramedy was loved by critics and will expand in the weeks ahead becoming a major force on the indie scene. The filmmaker’s loyal fans in New York and Los Angeles routinely come out for his latest stories and soon it will test the waters in more parts of the country.The top ten films grossed an estimated $182.9M over the Friday-to-Monday period which was down 31% from last year when The Hangover Part II opened at number one with $103.4M over the long weekend; but even with 2010 when Shrek Forever After stayed on top in its second frame with $57.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"critic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Men-in-Black-III-Dethrones-The-Avengers"},{"id":"47509127072582","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Grey Takes the Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Grey Takes the Top SpotPlus, Underworld holds at #2, and One for the Money takes third.by Gitesh Pandya | January 30, 2012 |  CommentsThis weekend, audiences turned out for Liam Neeson’s latest thriller The Grey which topped a busy frame that saw three new action entries attack a North American box office that already had plenty of action offerings. Marking the first number one debut for rookie distributor Open Road, the R-rated Alaskan survival pic bowed to an estimated $20M from 3,185 theaters for a solid $6,279 average. Following Taken and Unknown, Neeson has emerged as a more cerebral action hero and has now anchored three number one hits over the past three years which is more than most other Hollywood stars like Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Angelina Jolie, Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Smith, Matt Damon, or Denzel Washington.Reviews were favorable for The Grey but audiences were not too thrilled with the outcome as the wolf attack flick earned a disappointing B- grade from CinemaScore. Social media chatter on Twitter included plenty of disappointment from people who thought that Neeson would have a bigger presence in the film given his prominence in the advertising campaign. But after the shocking $24.7M debut of Taken over Super Bowl weekend in 2009 and the brawny $21.9M debut of Unknown over last year’s Presidents Day holiday frame, it made sense that Neeson was far and away the top commercial selling point for the $25M production which boasted no other major stars. Coming up on his 60th birthday, the busy Irish actor could possibly star in a whopping five number one hits this year thanks to the February 10 re-release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, the March 30 bow of Wrath of the Titans, the May 18 launch of Battleship, and the July 20 release of The Dark Knight Rises.Despite all the action competition, last week’s box office champ Underworld: Awakening held up incredibly well dropping 51% to an estimated $12.5M for the lowest sophomore decline in the history of the four-film franchise. The first three pics each fell by 55-65% after their debuts and generally fourth chapters in a sci-fi or horror series draw such a big part of the built-in audience upfront that they crumble in the second frame. Sony has taken in $45.1M after ten days with its Kate Beckinsale vehicle and can expect a final take in the $65-70M range helped in part by 3D surcharges.Katherine Heigl landed in third place with a respectable debut for her latest film One for the Money which bowed to an estimated $11.8M from 2,737 sites for a decent $4,293 average. Lionsgate refrained from screening the PG-13 action-comedy for critics but reviews that eventually came out were brutal making it the front-runner for next year’s Razzie Awards at this early stage in the race. Heigl’s films routinely open in double digit millions despite horrible reviews and lame plots although this one lacked a notable male lead. Money, which finds the actress playing a bail bondswoman hunting down an old flame, skewed heavily towards women with studio research showing that the audience was 79% female and 74% over 25. With a lackluster B- CinemaScore, the road ahead looks grim.The fighter pilot actioner Red Tails dropped 45% from its impressive debut and took fourth place with an estimated $10.4M. Fox’s release of the George Lucas production has collected $33.8M in ten days and a final tally of $55-60M seems likely which is more than most expected.Scoring the worst opening of the frame’s three new releases, but the best audience feedback, was Summit’s Man on a Ledge with an estimated $8.3M. The PG-13 film averaged a weak $2,752 per theater from 2,998 locations and just couldn’t compete with the wide range of other action offerings in the marketplace. Reviews were dull and lead actor Sam Worthington has never anchored an action hit outside of pre-existing brands like Clash of the Titans or James Cameron. But Ledge did have broad appeal with men and women represented equally and 56% of the crowd being under 25. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+ and the Friday-to-Saturday increase was 44% – both tops among the freshmen.A pair of Oscar nominees for Best Picture followed, each exploiting the nominations in a different way. The Tom Hanks-Sandra Bullock drama Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close dipped only 29% to an estimated $7.1M in its second weekend of wide release to raise the cume to $21.1M. Warner Bros. has used a Million Dollar Baby-style strategy with this 9/11 pic by opening in just a small number of theaters in late December in order to qualify and then waiting until nomination time to go nationwide letting others duke it out during awards season in hopes that it will be a fresh new option for voters and mainstream audiences alike. The plan worked for Baby which triumphed over the presumed front-runner The Aviator that year. But it may not be repeat this time as Loud only scored one other Academy Award nomination and was left out of the Director race. Still, the Oscar heat could help the film’s legs at the box office over the next few weeks as mature audiences catch up on Academy-endorsed films.George Clooney’s The Descendants expanded on Friday more than tripling its run on the heels of earning five Oscar nods and jumped back into the top ten at number seven with an estimated $6.6M. Now getting a second life in its 11th week of release, the Fox Searchlight film boosted its theater count by 257% from 560 locations to 2,001 and watched its weekend gross jump 176% although its average fell by 23%. The Alexander Payne-directed pic has banked $58.8M to date and could rake in a lot more thanks to the Oscar heat and the fact that it has some star power and mainstream appeal.Former number one Contraband followed with an estimated $6.5M, down 46%, giving Universal $56.4M to date for the Mark Wahlberg actioner. Disney’s 3D makeover of Beauty and the Beast dropped 39% to an estimated $5.3M for $41.1M so far. The animated film’s lifetime gross including the 1991 original release plus the 2002 special edition is now $212.5M. Rounding out the top ten was Steven Soderbergh’s action thriller Haywire which fell a sharp 53% in its second weekend to an estimated $4M putting the Relativity title at $15.3M in ten days.Oscar nominees all hustled this past week to turn nominations into extra box office. Distributors worked hard to cash in as Academy endorsements and media hype can translate into broader moviegoer interest, especially for smaller films that need more convincing. But with this game comes added expenditures as more prints are needed and additional advertising is purchased so the net “Oscar bump” is nearly impossible to calculate.The undisputed front-runner The Artist expanded from 662 to 897 theaters and saw its weekend take rise 40% to an estimated $3.3M giving The Weinstein Co. a total of $16.7M with plenty more to come. Its average of $3,696 was not too impressive but it did inch up 3% from last weekend. A near-impossible sell in the U.S. market, The Artist is now fully in the spotlight and positioned to pull in audiences that would not have purchased tickets before. There will still be resistance to the silent 1930s-set French-produced film from the broader mainstream crowd so the cume will only rise so high. But with numerous wins including the top film prizes from both the PGA and DGA, the Golden Globe for Best Picture – Comedy or Musical, Critics Choice awards for Picture and Director, plus ten Academy Award nominations, The Artist is clearly the film to beat and can extend its box office fortunes past Feb 26 if it pulls off a big victory.Martin Scorsese’s Hugo, which led all films with 11 Oscar nods, enjoyed a similar expansion from 650 to 965 sites and grossed an estimated $2.3M. Its boost of 143% was much greater as the 3D film is more accessible and includes characters speaking to each other. Paramount’s total is $58.7M. The incredibly expensive production did not fare too well during its initial run but now has a chance add to its cume by reaching those who missed it the first time around. Fellow Best Picture contender War Horse did not benefit much as the Spielberg pic fell 37% to an estimated $2M raising the sum to $75.6M. The war drama lost nearly 700 screens but also saw its average drop too.Following its qualifying run, Glenn Close’s Albert Nobbs opened in limited release after nabbing three Oscar nominations and grossed an estimated $773,000 from 245 theaters for a sluggish $3,155 average. The overall cume is $823,000 for Roadside Attractions and reviews have been mixed for the film but solid for Close’s performance as a woman playing a man.Elsewhere below the top ten, Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol achieved a pair of notable milestones this weekend. The domestic haul broke the $200M mark with $202.6M thus far while the international run continued to shine raising the overseas tally to $369M. The action hit is now the top-grossing installment of the popular franchise with a global gross of $571.6M and counting thanks in part to a solid debut in China where it raked in $12.7M in only two days more than quintupling the opening of the last Mission: Impossible picture there. The $600M barrier will be crushed soon.The top ten films grossed an estimated $92.5M which was up 6% from last year when The Rite opened in the top spot with $14.8M; but down 11% from 2010 when Avatar stayed at number one yet again in its seventh frame with $31.3M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"vampires","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Grey-Takes-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509127270215","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Contraband Steals Box Office Crown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Contraband Steals Box Office Crownby RT Staff | January 15, 2012 |  CommentsMark Wahlberg’s action-thriller Contraband took control of the box office this weekend, while the latest Disney 3D re-release did relatively well and last weekend’s champ crashed and burned in its second go around.Giving off some good vibrations this weekend was Universal’s Contraband, which opened with an estimated $24.1M this weekend from 2,863 playdates, for a per screen average of $8,418. Wahlberg is a surprisingly strong draw at the box office, with all of his wide releases over the last decade opening in the double digits. His box office history reminds me of a poor man’s Denzel Washington, just without the accolades. Audiences dug the film as evidenced by its A- grade from Cinemascore.Second place went to the 3D re-release Beauty and the Beast, which follows last year’s huge re-release of The Lion King. Beast opened with $18.5M, according to estimates, for a per screen average of $7,044. It didn’t quite reach the heights of The Lion King, which opened last September to $30.2M, but for a 20 year old film, it’s still pretty strong, especially when you consider the 3D Blu-ray has been on sale for 3 months already. Beast also now holds the record for highest opening weekend for an animated film in January, taking down Hoodwinked from this weekend in 2006. If there’s any company that knows how to milk their products for all they’re worth, it’s Disney. They’ve got Finding Nemo ready for 3D later this year.Tom Cruise’s latest impossible mission fell to number three this weekend, with Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol taking in $11.5M, according to estimates, a drop of 42% from last weekend. Its total now stands at $186.7M, with the $200M barrier ready to fall.The musical notes of Joyful Noise opened in fourth place this weekend, with an estimated $11.3M, for a per screen average of a decent $4,148. Starring Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah, the film also received an A- from Cinemascore, meaning that it might have some legs over the next few weeks.A franchise star arrived in the next spot. Robert Downey, Jr. (star of not one, but two current major franchises) landed in fifth place this week with Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows which dipped 39% to an estimated $8.4M, bringing its cume to $170M after five weeks.And the moment we’ve been waiting for… last weekend’s shocking box office champ The Devil Inside completely collapsed in its second weekend tumbling 76.6% to an estimated $7.9M. The drop was one of the worst in box office history, which isn’t surprising considering a) horror films generally are front-loaded and b) the reviews were downright horrible (which still may be too nice). Still, with a total take of $46.2M so far, Paramount is laughing all the way to the bank, and we can expect to see even more of these low budget, found footage films in the future.Seventh place belonged to Craig, Daniel Craig and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo which fell 40% to an estimated $6.8M, bringing its total up to $88M. Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked followed in eighth place with an estimated $5.8M, a drop of 39% from last weekend, bringing its cume to $118.8M after five laps. Ninth place belonged to even more animals as the Steven Spielberg-directed War Horse brought in $5.6M, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $65.8M.Meryl Streep’s latest bid for a third Oscar, the Margaret Thatcher political drama The Iron Lady, did well in its nationwide expansion after two weeks of platform release. The Weinstein Co. title grossed an estimated $5.4M from 802 sites (up from 5) averaging a solid $6,716 per theater. It was almost identical to last weekend’s expansion of another British political drama Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy which debuted in 809 locations for a similar $6,772 average playing to an older upscale crowd.The top ten films grossed an estimated $105.3M which was down 2% from last year when The Green Hornet opened in the top spot with $33.5M; and down 29% from 2010 when Avatar remained at number one with $42.8M in its fifth frame.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"SDCC","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Contraband-Steals-Box-Office-Crown"},{"id":"47509127287630","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Immortals Debuts at the Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Immortals Debuts at the TopPlus, Jack and Jill and J. Edgar aren't far behind, and Puss in Boots stays hot.by Gitesh Pandya | November 14, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, Greek Gods conquered the North American box office as the 3D adventure epic Immortals opened at number one while Adam Sandler’s new comedy Jack and Jill and two-time chart-topper Puss in Boots fought over second place with virtually identical grosses. The new FBI biopic J. Edgar opened more like a Clint Eastwood film than a Leonardo DiCaprio one, settling into fifth place in its first weekend. Overall the marketplace saw healthy double digit gains over last year, thanks in part to the Veterans Day holiday falling on Friday instead of Thursday this year. Multiplex activity is set to go even higher very soon with the Twilight juggernaut right around the corner.Relativity Media shot to number one with Immortals, which bowed to an estimated $32M from 3,112 theaters for a muscular $10,283 average. It was the third biggest opening this year for an R-rated film — and best for a non-sequel — trailing The Hangover Part II and Paranormal Activity 3, which debuted to $85.9M and $52.6M, respectively. Opening above industry expectations, Immortals received mixed reviews from critics but connected with action and fantasy fans who powered the opening day Friday to $15M. Saturday sales dropped a sharp 32% from Veterans Day and Sunday is estimated to slide by another 33% to $6.8M.Original action films that are not part of an existing brand like James Bond or The Lord of the Rings rarely open above $30M during the football season when millions of males are occupied on Saturdays and Sundays. Studio research showed that the stylishly violent war epic played to an audience that was 60% male, and 75% was under 35. 70% of the business ($22.4M) came from non-white audiences while the CinemaScore grade was a B. 3D was a popular option for Immortals as 66% of the grosses came from the higher-priced format.Produced for $75M, Immortals also opened overseas in 35 territories this weekend including Japan, Germany, the U.K., China, and Russia grossing an estimated $36M for a global debut of $68M.If estimates hold, Adam Sandler’s latest laughfest Jack and Jill will open in second place with an estimated $26M, a figure that rival studios believe is too optimistic. The Sony release averaged $7,563 from 3,438 theaters and did not make it into the $30-40M range that the funnyman usually finds himself in with broad comedies. Friday started with $9.9M, Saturday eased 2% to $9.6M while Sunday is estimated to drop by only 32% to an estimated $6.5M. That would be a small Sunday drop for a Sandler comedy during the football season, although this PG-rated pic is hoping for family business which would yield a stronger-than-usual Sunday performance.Critics slammed Jack and Jill with some of their harshest words of any film this year. Moviegoers were only somewhat satisfied with what they got as the pic got a B CinemaScore grade. Studio research showed that the childish humor played broadly as the audience was 52% female, 57% 25 and older, with 53% being families. Despite the atrocious reviews, Jack could continue to bring in respectable grosses as no new mainstream comedies will open over the next three weeks.Following close behind according to estimates but hoping to finish in second place when final figures are tallied on Monday was two-time box office leader Puss in Boots, which dipped only 23% to an estimated $25.5M. The 3D toon smashed the $100M mark on Saturday in its 16th day of release and has grossed a stellar $108.8M to date. Tougher competition will start on Friday with the arrival of the rival 3D animated kidpic Happy Feet Two followed five days later by The Muppets, but a final domestic haul of $160M or more still seems likely. Paramount has had a red hot year in 2011 and has now seen eight of its eleven wide releases join the century club, while the ones that didn’t have performed well too.Only $500,000 separated Jack and Jill and Puss in Boots according to studio estimates. Final numbers to be released on Monday will include actual sales figures for Sunday and could see the two films switch positions, making Jack that rare broad comedy from Sandler that opens outside of the top two positions.Universal’s action-comedy Tower Heist fell a moderate 45% to an estimated $13.2M in its second weekend and has raised its ten-day tally to a decent $43.9M. The $85M Ben Stiller-Eddie Murphy vehicle could end its domestic run at about $70M meaning a strong overseas run will be needed.Clint Eastwood’s latest film debuted in fifth place. The biopic J. Edgar headlined by Leonardo DiCaprio bowed to an estimated $11.5M from 1,910 locations for a solid $6,005 average. The opening was on par with the nationwide debut of the director’s last film Hereafter which opened to $12M and a $5,510 average in October of last year on its way to a disappointing $32.7M final. Reviews were mixed with many top ones being negative and audiences also were not too thrilled as the R-rated drama earned only a B grade from CinemaScore. J. Edgar platformed in seven theaters in top markets on Wednesday to get a jump on the weekend, putting the total at $11.6M for Warner Bros.The stoner threequel A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas suffered an understandable 55% drop in its second weekend collecting an estimated $5.9M putting the ten-day tally at $23.2M. Produced for only $20M, the Warner Bros. release fared a bit better than its predecessor, Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay, which tumbled 59% in its sophomore frame, although it faced the opening of the superhero juggernaut Iron Man, which stole the attention of young men. Christmas looks set to finish with about $35M putting it just behind Guantanamo‘s $38.1M but ahead of the $18.2M of 2004’s Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle.Fox’s sci-fi thriller In Time declined by 45% in its third round to an estimated $4.2M giving Fox $30.7M in 17 days. Paramount’s horror hit Paranormal Activity 3 joined the century club with its estimated $3.6M weekend, off 57%, putting the low-cost $5M chiller at $100.8M and counting. It should finish near the $107.9M of the first film in the highly profitable series.The studio’s dance remake Footloose followed with an estimated $2.7M, down 39%, for a $48.9M sum. Rounding out the top ten was Hugh Jackman’s boxing hit Real Steel which dropped 42% to an estimated $2M and $81.7M to date for Disney. The robot flick is now the actor’s second-biggest non-Wolverine hit after 2004’s Van Helsing, which grossed $120.1M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $126.6M which was up a healthy 18% from last year when Megamind remained in the top spot with $29.1M; and up 2% from 2009 when 2012 opened at number one with $65.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"jones, Television, TV, toronto, CW, movies, canceled, Amazon, TCA, Fire, E3, christmas, awards, Superheroes","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Immortals-Debuts-at-the-Top"},{"id":"47509127277385","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Sherlock Holmes Wins the Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Sherlock Holmes Wins the WeekendPlus, Alvin and the Chipmunks and Mission: Impossible take #2 and #3.by Gitesh Pandya | December 18, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, three big Hollywood sequels led the North American box office pumping in some badly needed new content but that didn’t stop the overall marketplace from suffering double digit losses over last year and the year before. Studios are hoping that audiences are just busy right now with holiday shopping and end-of-year activities and that their films will be well-positioned to take advantage of the extra free time people will soon have in the days ahead.Doing what its predecessor couldn’t, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows debuted at number one with an estimated $40M from 3,703 theaters for a solid $10,807 average. The $145M-budgeted Warner Bros. sequel debuted 36% below the $62.3M of the first Holmes which launched in second place behind Avatar on the Christmas frame two years ago over what was the largest weekend in box office history. Since audiences are historically less available in mid-December, the follow-up was never expected to open at the same heights. Shadows earned good reviews from critics and an encouraging A- grade from moviegoers polled by CinemaScore. Sales on Saturday, however, showed virtually no growth over Friday’s opening day. The marketplace for adults will get crowded very quickly in the days ahead so early positive buzz will be crucial as audiences start making up their decisions for what to see over the upcoming holiday break.Sherlock entered only six international markets day and date with domestic and grossed an estimated $14.7M from 2,113 screens including $5.8M in the United Kingdom where it ranked number one by a wide margin. Italy was close behind with $5M while Korea and Germany open later this week.[rtimage]siteImageId=10248329[/rtimage]Opening in second place was Fox’s kidpic threequel Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked which took in an estimated $23.5M from 3,723 locations for a $6,312 average. It was well below the debuts of its two predecessors as the first Alvin gave families something new and fresh on the same weekend of 2007 with a $44.3M debut while the second installment launched over the lucrative Christmas frame with $48.9M in 2009. Chipwrecked opened while kids were still in school and parents were busy with holiday shopping so it was expected to have a softer bow. And aside from a cruise ship storyline, Chipwrecked offered almost nothing new to the table. Last year this weekend Yogi Bear bowed to $16.4M and finished with over six times that amount after playing through the holidays.But while the start was slower, the road ahead looks promising since most films rolling into theaters this holiday season are aimed at adults and there are no new G-rated films for kids opening for the rest of the year. Fox is hoping to capture the family crowd as more children get out of school and more parents get time off to take trips to the multiplexes for some holiday fun. PG-rated competitors will include Steven Spielberg’s The Adventures of Tintin which is based on a brand that is less familiar to American kids and Matt Damon’s We Bought a Zoo which is less zany for kids looking for laughs. Studio research showed that females made up 54% of the crowd and the film earned a good B+ overall grade from CinemaScore.Chipwrecked opened overseas on 3,800 screens in 38 markets and grossed an estimated $14.5M with only a handful of the major markets debuting like the United Kingdom, Korea, and Spain.[rtimage]siteImageId=10248330[/rtimage]Paramount found itself in third place with a unique limited release of its action tentpole Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol which grossed an estimated $13M from only 425 locations which included about 300 IMAX venues plus other large-format sites. The $145M-budgeted Tom Cruise spy flick averaged a sensational $30,588 per location helped by the higher ticket prices. Including the first shows on Thursday evening starting at 6:00pm, the total was $13.6M. It was a sensational start for an unorthodox move designed to showcase the action film with limited availability in only the biggest possible screens in hopes of sparking strong word-of-mouth that would fuel interest for the film’s regular nationwide run which begins this Wednesday. Adding to the grosses was the special prologue for the Warner Bros. tentpole The Dark Knight Rises which played on selected full large-screen IMAX sites.The tactic was needed for three reasons. First, the franchise is old having been around for over 15 years with the last installment underperforming in 2006. This helps to eventize the film adding to the excitement. Second, Cruise has suffered from serious popularity issues over the last several years with many moviegoers being repelled just by his name alone. He is not the box office draw that he used to be and this special IMAX release allows action fans to focus on the high-octane entertainment and thrills they get and shifts attention away from the star. Indeed, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol earned the best reviews of any action film this year. And third, the marketplace for grown-up fare will be super-competitive this holiday season so this release aims to get buzz going so audiences choose it first instead of other franchise offerings flooding theaters.The studio’s $13M weekend estimate was quite aggressive as it includes a projected dip of only 13% on Sunday. That is unusually low especially for an action film during the football season when adult males become less available on Sundays. Last weekend, the smallest Saturday-to-Sunday drop in the top ten was 36%. The limited nature of the release has led to sell-outs which would cause more business than usual to spill over into Sunday, however the final gross to be reported on Monday could very well see this figure go down and closer to $12M. The resulting average would still be north of $28,000 and incredibly impressive.[rtimage]siteImageId=10248331[/rtimage]Overseas results were spectacular with the new Mission: Impossible ruling the international box office with an opening of an estimated $68.2M from 6,079 theaters across 36 markets with many seeing the IMAX version open a few days ahead of conventional screens. Leading the way was Korea with a stellar $11.1M, Japan with $9M, Russia with $6.1M, and India with $4M. Cruise and company have been on a worldwide tour hosting premieres and generating plenty of publicity to help drive in business. Much of Latin America will see openings this coming week including Mexico and Brazil.With box office down once again versus last year, 3D became a much smaller part of the picture this year. Last year, four of the top five films this weekend enjoyed 3D surcharges. But this frame, the top seven films were all presented in 2D only and just one new opener for the rest of the year will be a 3D one – Tintin.Dropping from first place was the star-packed holiday comedy New Year’s Eve which fell a reasonable 43% to an estimated $7.4M giving Warner Bros. a mere $24.8M in ten days. A final gross near the $50M mark seems likely. Fellow underperforming sophomore comedy The Sitter tumbled 55% to an estimated $4.4M bumping its ten-day take to only $17.7M. Look for Fox to end its run with the Jonah Hill pic at $30M. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 followed with an estimated $4.3M, off 45%, putting Summit’s total at $266.4M.Four films each squeezed into the $3-4M range filling up the rest of the slots in the top ten with estimates that were within $200,000 of each other. Final grosses to be reported on Monday should show a change in the chart positions.[rtimage]siteImageId=10248332[/rtimage]Taking seventh place, for now, was the Charlize Theron film Young Adult with an estimated $3.7M while expanding nationwide from eight to 986 theaters in its second weekend. Averaging a dull $3,702 per site, the $12M-budgeted Paramount release fell below the wide breaks of past end-of-year expansions for director Jason Reitman. His last film Up in the Air, also released by Paramount, fared much better with $11.3M and $5,947 average from 1,895 theaters over the Christmas holiday frame in 2009 while 2007’s Juno did $10.6M and a $10,436 average on the session in between Christmas and New Year’s. Both widened later in their runs in their fourth round. Paramount reported a projected 17% Saturday-to-Sunday decline for Young Adult which was very modest so the final gross and chart position may come out lower. Total stands at $4.1M including the limited run and a wider release is planned for January 13.The studio’s acclaimed Martin Scorsese film Hugo, which earned three Golden Globe nominations including Best Picture and Best Director, dropped 40% to an estimated $3.6M giving the pricey train station saga $39.1M to date. With chipmunks stealing away kids, Arthur Christmas fell by its largest amount yet falling 45% to an estimated $3.6M giving Sony only $38.5M so far. The 3D toon grossed an additional $9.7M overseas this weekend to raise the international sum to $72.8M and global tally to $111.3M. Rounding out the top ten was Disney’s The Muppets with an estimated $3.5M, down 51%, for a $70.9M total.With moviegoers about to get extended breaks from work and school this week, the marketplace is about to get awful crowded, awful fast. Studios are hoping to mine the riches as weekday sales will soon start to get stronger with an assortment of high-profile films hitting theaters in the coming days. Wednesday will see Sony release The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in 2,800 locations while Paramount debuts Steven Spielberg’s The Adventures of Tintin in 3,000 houses and expands Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol into a full wide release in 3,400 total sites. On Friday, Fox opens the Matt Damon starrer We Bought a Zoo in 3,000 theaters which will be followed on Sunday by the Christmas Day bows of Spielberg’s other offering War Horse from Disney in 2,300 and Summit’s suspense thriller The Darkest Hour in 2,200 locations. Plus, many awards contenders will open or expand throughout the next two weeks.[rtimage]siteImageId=10248333[/rtimage]Opening to good but not stellar results in platform release was the Sony Classics release Carnage with an estimated $86,000 from five houses for a $17,139 average. Based on the hit play about two sets of parents dealing with trouble between their kids, the Roman Polanski film starring Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, John C. Reilly, and Christoph Waltz earned good reviews but has not been a major player during awards season outside of its recent double Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress – Comedy or Musical for Foster and Winslet.Other indie films continued to expand. The Focus thriller Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy widened from four to 16 theaters and grossed an estimated $452,000 for a strong $28,250 average and $852,000 cume. The Artist, which led all films with six Globe nods, expanded slightly from 16 to 17 sites and collected an estimated $287,000 with a $16,882 average. The Weinstein Co. has taken in $1.3M so far.David Cronenberg’s A Dangerous Method took in an estimated $159,000 from 17 playdates for a $9,353 average while the Michael Fassbender drama Shame averaged $5,980 with an estimated $305,000 from 51 locations. Totals stand at $728,000 and $1.2M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $107M which was down 14% from last year when TRON: Legacy opened in the top spot with $44M; and down 15% from 2009 when Avatar debuted at number one with $77M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Elton, cults, rings, 2020","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Sherlock-Holmes-Wins-the-Weekend"},{"id":"47509127282507","title":"Box Office Guru: Breaking Dawn Threepeats Over Weak Frame","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru: Breaking Dawn Threepeats Over Weak Frameby RT Staff | December 5, 2011 |  CommentsThe annual post-turkey blues smacked the North American box office as The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 topped a sluggish frame that saw no new films open in wide release. The rest of the top ten featured the same Thanksgiving leftovers although in different positions thanks to some awards contenders that expanded into more theaters. Overall, ticket sales slumped to their second lowest level of 2011 beating only the weekend after Labor Day which often is the worst session of the entire year. Hollywood is hoping this was the calm before the storm as the final wave of new movies for the holiday season begins this Friday.Breaking Dawn became the first Twilight movie to ever rule the box office for three weeks in a row with its $16.9M frame, according to estimates. The Summit blockbuster fell 60% from its Friday-to-Sunday take over the Thanksgiving holiday which represented a better hold than 2009’s New Moon which fell by 64% in the exact same situation. With $247.3M in 17 days, Dawn is running 3% behind its predecessors Eclipse and Moon which each had just over $255M in the bank in the same number of days despite being released in different seasons of the year. The Bella-and-Edward wedding flick now ranks as the fourth biggest grosser of the year trailing fellow sequels Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 ($381M), Transformers: Dark of the Moon ($352.4M), and The Hangover Part 2 ($254.5M). A final North American gross of roughly $290M seems likely.The fourth Twilight installment was still a big player at the overseas box office taking in another $40.2M in its third weekend. That boosted the international total to a stellar $341M while the worldwide tally climbed up to $588.3M. The four films in the franchise have now grossed a combined $2.4 billion globally averaging an amazing $600M per film.Staying put in the runner-up spot was Disney’s The Muppets which tumbled 62% to an estimated $11.2M bumping the cume to $56.1M after 12 days. The Kermit-and-Piggy pic suffered the worst fall of any film in the top ten despite winning a solid A grade from CinemaScore last week. The well-known brand and the Black Friday school holiday contributed to a very strong showing upfront and now business is fading away. Muppets should stabilize next weekend since no new kidpics are opening and find its way to a final gross in the $80-90M range.Martin Scorsese’s big-budget 3D film Hugo rose two spots to third place thanks to a wider expansion plus strong word-of-mouth and reviews. The PG-rated film went from 1,277 locations to 1,840 and grossed an estimated $7.6M for an average of $4,144. The director’s acclaimed use of the 3D format continued to find audiences as 76% of the weekend’s gross came from 3D screens – the highest rate for any film in the format currently. Hugo upped its profile in the Oscar race on Thursday when it was named the best picture of 2011 by the National Board of Review with Scorsese taking the director prize too. If it earns top nominations next week from the Golden Globes, the Paramount release can continue to stay in the game at the box office at least until the next wave of family films arrives with Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked on December 16 and Steven Spielberg’s The Adventures of Tintin on December 21. But with $25.2M in 12 days, Hugo should be able to cross the $50M domestic mark.Enjoying the smallest decline in the top ten for a film not expanding, Sony’s holiday toon Arthur Christmas placed fourth with an estimated $7.4M in its second weekend dipping only 39%. The 3D kidpic has taken in a modest $25.3M in its first 12 days but its yuletide theme should allow it to have good legs for a few more weeks. Both of next weekend’s new wide releases – New Year’s Day and The Sitter – will play to adults and not hurt the family marketplace too much. A final domestic take in the neighborhood of $50M seems likely. Overseas, where Arthur Christmas has been playing longer, the weekend saw a haul of an estimated $11.4M putting the international sum at $45.3M and the worldwide figure at $70.6M.Warner Bros. saw an estimated $6M for its expensive animated sequel Happy Feet Two which collected an estimated $6M in its third round. With $51.8M in 17 days, the 3D toon is running a disturbing 57% behind the pace of its predecessor which held the number one spot during all three of its first weekends. The domestic final should reach about $65M and the studio will hope for much better results from international markets where 3D animation can deliver much stronger results. This weekend, the penguin pic opened in Russia, the U.K., Germany, and Spain and collected an estimated $16.3M from 40 markets for an international total of $34M and a worldwide take of only $85.8M.Finishing in sixth place was Adam Sandler’s latest Razzie hopeful Jack and Jill which made an estimated $5.5M, down 45%, for a cume to date of $64.3M. The Sony release looks to end with $75-80M making it one of the actor’s worst-performing broad comedies.George Clooney’s dysfunctional family saga The Descendants continued to score big points with ticket buyers in moderate release rising two spots to number seven with an estimated $5.2M. For the third weekend in a row, the Fox Searchlight release posted the best per-theater average in the top ten with a sturdy $9,059 from 574 locations, up 141 from last weekend. All other films in the top ten averaged between $1,100 and $4,200. The Hawaii-set film earned a handful of nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards this past week including best picture and director and will continue to add new theaters throughout December. Descendants saw its gross dip by only 29% and its average fall by 47% thanks to the expansion. The current cume of $18.1M is sure to double by the end of the month.Dropping 51% in its fourth attack was the 3D actioner Immortals which collected an estimated $4.4M pushing the Relativity Media film’s domestic gross past its $75M budget to $75.6M. Overseas, the Greek mythology adventure has taken in north of $100M. Look for the North American figure to end up at around the $85M mark.The Ben Stiller-Eddie Murphy action-comedy Tower Heist held up surprisingly well sliding only 42% to an estimated $4.1M. Universal has banked $70.8M so far and could be headed for a $80M finish. Rounding out the top ten was the 3D animated pic Puss in Boots which tumbled 59% to an estimated $3.1M and $139.5M total. The second highest grossing film since Labor Day after Twilight, the Paramount release will end up in the $145-150M range putting it in the same company as last year’s November offering from DreamWorks, Megamind, which grossed $148.4M. Puss grabbed an estimated $23M overseas this weekend to raise the international sum to $89.2M and the global tally to $228.7M.Platforming in just 10 theaters in six top markets and generating plenty of heat was Fox Searchlight’s Shame which debuted to an estimated $361,000 for a potent $36,100 average. The NC-17 film starring Michael Fassbender as a New York bachelor addicted to sex has won positive reviews as well as universal praise for its leading man who is currently one of the favorites in the competitive Best Actor Oscar race. Shame will take a slow and steady approach to its roll-out expanding to nine more theaters on Friday in such markets as Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, and Philadelphia.Awards hopefuls in limited release continued to reach out to arthouse crowds with mixed results. Fassbender saw encouraging results from his other indie release, David Cronenberg’s Sigmund Freud pic A Dangerous Method co-starring Viggo Mortensen and Keira Knightley, which collected an estimated $123,000 from four sites for a solid $30,750 average for Sony Classics. The Weinstein Company’s silent film The Artist, which last week won best picture and director honors from the New York Film Critics Circle, widened slightly in its second weekend from four to six houses and grossed an estimated $206,000 for a strong $34,333 average. Cumes are $416,000 and $496,000, respectively.The biopic My Week with Marilyn saw a more subdued response from audiences grossing an estimated $1.2M from 244 theaters for a mild $4,836 average. The Weinstein Co. has taken in $3.9M to date for the Michelle Williams film which should earn the actress plenty of nominations in the coming months from various awards givers.The top ten films grossed an estimated $71.4M which was down 5% from last year when Tangled rose to the top spot with $21.6M; and down 17% from 2009 when The Blind Side climbed into number one with $20M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, Office, Family, hollywood, venice, television, See, child's, Schedule, Star, christmas, fast","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Breaking-Dawn-Threepeats-Over-Weak-Frame"},{"id":"47509126065987","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Washington Rules Presidents Day with Safe House","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Washington Rules Presidents Day with Safe Houseby Gitesh Pandya | February 21, 2012 |  CommentsThe long Presidents Day holiday frame saw a close battle between four films competing for the top spot but it was Denzel Washington who audiences selected as commander-in-chief of the box office as his action holdover Safe House beat all competitors in its second weekend to claim first place. The next two spots also went to two of last week’s overperforming films which both remained popular with North American ticket buyers. Rounding out the top five were new releases with Nicolas Cage’s Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengenace targeting males in fourth and Reese Witherspoon’s This Means War playing to women in fifth. The overall marketplace over the four-day Friday-to-Monday period once again beat last year’s levels as spending was spread out across a variety of titles with no one film dominating the scene.Washington’s action thriller Safe House led the long weekend as Universal’s CIA pic grossed an estimated $28.4M thanks to a 41% decline over the Friday-to-Sunday span. The 11-day total surged to $82.6M and the film marked the first time a holdover ruled Presidents Day weekend since 2005’s Hitch. House’s ten-day take of $78.1M was just a bit off from the $80.4M that his 2007 hit American Gangster made over the same period of time. That film’s $130.2M total stands as the Oscar winner’s career best, however Safe House has a shot at beating it if it continues to play well in the coming weeks.Swapping positions from last weekend’s close race, The Vow settled for the runner-up spot this time with an estimated $26.6M including a 44% drop over the three-day period. Sony has banked a stellar $88.5M after 11 days easily beating the $56.1M that Channing Tatum’s 2010 romance Dear John grossed over the same span. A finish near the $130M mark could result for this hit as well. Vow cost about $30M to produce, though, which was about one-third as much as Safe House’s $85M budget.Posting the best hold in the top ten was the effects-driven adventure sequel Journey 2: The Mysterious Island which slipped to an estimated $26.4M for a three-day decline of only 27%. The Warner Bros. franchise film starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has banked an impressive $59.5M in its first 11 days and could end up beating the $101.7M of its 2008 predecessor which was headlined by Brendan Fraser. This is the second consecutive action franchise that The Rock has stepped into with encouraging results. Last April’s Fast Five went on to score the highest gross ever in the decade-long series and this summer the former wrestler steps into G.I. Joe: Retaliation hoping to give that series a boost too.Leading the weekend’s new releases was the Nicolas Cage sequel Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance which landed in fourth place with an estimated $25.7M over four days. Averaging $8,097 from 3,174 theaters, the 3D action pic took in half the business of its 2D predecessor which opened a year ago shattering the Presidents Day opening weekend record with $52M over the four-day session. According to studio research, the audience was 61% male and 52% over 25 while the CinemaScore grade was a poor C+. The new Rider installment was reportedly produced for a lower cost than the first film.Opening in fifth place was the romantic action-comedy This Means War starring Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine, and Tom Hardy with an estimated $20.4M. The Fox release about a pair of CIA studs using their agency tricks to compete for the same woman averaged $6,397 from 3,189 theaters. Reviews were dismal but audiences were mostly satisfied with what they got as the CinemaScore grade was a good A-. As expected, adult women made up the primary audience as studio research showed that the crowd was 65% female and 60% 25 and older. The three-day take of $17.4M was in the same neighborhood as the openings for some of Witherspoon’s previous starring vehicles like the $16.8M of last year’s Water for Elephants and the $16.4M of 2005’s Just Like Heaven.Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace 3D fell sharply in its second weekend to an estimated $10.2M for an 11-day total of $36M. In lifetime box office terms, that allowed the Jar Jar Binks tale to surpass the original Star Wars for the number four spot on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters with $467.1M. The sci-fi pic Chronicle held up well in its third round with an estimated $9.2M for a $52.7M cume for Fox.Following in eighth with an estimated $8.1M was the Miyazaki animated film The Secret World of Arrietty which debuted in 1,522 locations for a mild $5,323 average for Disney. The supernatural thriller The Woman in Black grossed an estimated $7.9M for a $46.5M total. Rounding out the top ten was Liam Neeson’s The Grey with an estimated $3.8M and a cume to date of $48.7M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $166.6M over the four-day holiday frame which was up 11% from last year when Unknown opened in the top spot with $25.5M; but down 22% from 2010’s holiday when Valentine’s Day debuted at number one with $63.1M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"romance, Marvel, news, Larson, Red","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Washington-Rules-Presidents-Day-with-Safe-House"},{"id":"47509127286605","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Twilight Destroys the Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Twilight Destroys the CompetitionPlus, Happy Feet Two takes second, and The Descendants cracks the top ten.by Gitesh Pandya | November 21, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, the wedding of the year attracted Bella and Edward fans around the world as the highly anticipated vampire sequel The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Pt. 1 crushed the competition across the globe debuting at number one. Not as warmly received in their return were the animated penguins of Happy Feet Two which opened in second place with only half the debut of its predecessor ahead of what will be a very competitive holiday season for kidpics. George Clooney’s The Decendants rocked the specialty box office and even made it into the top ten despite playing in very few theaters. Overall, Twilight led the marketplace to a healthy improvement over last year which is quite a statement given that a new Harry Potter film launched at that time.Delivering the second biggest opening of the year, and the fifth best of all-time, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Pt. 1 triumphed at the box office grossing an estimated $139.5M over the Friday-to-Sunday period. The fourth film in the lucrative Summit series averaged a stunning $34,351 from 4,061 locations despite having no help from 3D or IMAX, which have boosted grosses for many of the largest debuts of all-time. The bow was just 2% behind the $142.8M of New Moon from two years ago this same weekend. Both films played to the Twilight faithful, were only in 2D, and were released in just over 4,000 locations. The new pic, though, carried a much higher budget of $110M.Breaking Dawn Pt. 1 now sits at the number five spot on the list of the biggest opening weekends ever trailing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 ($169.2M), The Dark Knight ($158.4M), Spider-Man 3 ($151.1M), and New Moon. The weekend began with a $72M opening day which included $30.3M from Thursday night’s post-midnight shows. That was the second best post-midnight ever after Deathly Hallows 2 ($43.5M) and the third highest opening day after Hallows 2 ($91.1M) and New Moon ($72.7M). Breaking Dawn‘s Saturday suffered an understandable 43% plunge to $40.7M while Summit is estimating a 34% decline on Sunday to $26.8M. New Moon, which had the exact same type of calendar, fell a nearly identical 42% Saturday and then 34% on Sunday. Given the rise in 2D ticket prices over the last two years, it seems that the Twilight audience has declined by 8-10% between New Moon and Breaking Dawn.As with previous films in the series, women dominated the audience. Studio research showed that a whopping 80% of the crowd was female which was in line with New Moon‘s 80% and the first Twilight‘s 75%. The only summer title in the franchise — last year’s Eclipse which released in late June — had a broader audience that was 65% female. It was also the only pic released in IMAX and still stands as the top-grossing installment with $300.5M. The series will conclude this weekend next year with the launch of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Pt. 2, which opens on November 16, 2012.Sales were red hot overseas too this weekend. The roll-out into 54 international territories resulted in an estimated $144M from 9,950 venues since mid-week bows in certain markets putting the global debut at a stellar $283.5M. Top markets included the U.K. ($22M), Russia ($15M), France ($14.5M), Australia ($12.2M), Italy ($12M), Spain ($11.6M), and Brazil ($10.2M). With Breaking Dawn Part 1, the Twilight franchise this weekend shattered the $2 billion global box office mark.The animated penguin sequel Happy Feet Two finished the weekend in second place as expected but generated sales that were below expectations. The PG-rated film bowed to an estimated $22M from 3,606 theaters (including a super-wide 293 IMAX 3D venues) averaging a moderate $6,108 and came in at roughly half the level of the $41.5M debut of the first Feet from this same very weekend five years ago. That film topped the charts for three weeks in a row on its way to $198M. Reviews for the followup were mostly bad.The Feet debut was also well below those of other big studio toon offerings this year like Rio ($39.2M), Puss in Boots ($34.1M), Gnomeo &amp; Juliet ($25.4M), and The Lion King 3D ($30.2M), as well as sequels like Kung Fu Panda 2 ($47.7M) and Cars 2 ($66.1M). Parents have spent heavily on 3D toons this year and Happy Feet Two may have been too little, too late. 49% of the penguin gross came from the 3D screens which was about even with the 51% of Puss a few weeks ago. Warner Bros. will try to catch up with kids and families over the coming Thanksgiving week, however there will be stiff competition for this audience with studios unwisely launching three more PG-rated films aimed at families on Wednesday — Disney’s The Muppets, Paramount’s Hugo, and Sony’s Arthur Christmas.Last week’s top film Immortals fell sharply in its second weekend grossing an estimated $12.3M, down 62%. Most holdovers suffered larger than usual declines as last Friday was the Veterans Day holiday when most schools closed. The Relativity Media release has collected $53M in ten days and looks headed for the $75M vicinity.Adam Sandler’s latest helping of immature humor lost the usual half of its audience in the second weekend coming in fourth place. Jack and Jill fell 52% to an estimated $12M and has laughed up $41M in ten days heading to what should be a final gross in the neighborhood of $70M for Sony.The leggy toon Puss in Boots took a tumble in its fourth round thanks in part to the arrival of Happy Feet Two and dropped a steep 57% to an estimated $10.7M for a cume to date of $122.3M. Previous declines were only 3% for the sophomore session and 25% for the third weekend which included Veterans Day. Paramount and DreamWorks Animation were widely criticized for moving the release date earlier from November 4 to October 28, but the move paid off with a stellar $111.6M banked before the penguin pic arrived in the marketplace.Universal’s action-comedy Tower Heist followed with an estimated $7M, down 46%, giving the Ben Stiller-Eddie Murphy project $53.4M to date. Clint Eastwood’s political biopic J. Edgar did not hold up well in its second weekend falling 47% to an estimated $5.9M raising the cume to only $20.7M for Warner Bros. Clint pics used to show strong legs at the box office thanks to good word-of-mouth and an older audience. But recent projects have earned mixed feelings from critics and audiences alike with second weekend drops being 47% for last year’s Hereafter and 51% for 2009’s Invictus.Dropping 51% in its third try was the stoner sequel A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas which grossed an estimated $2.9M with $28.3M in 17 days so far. Fox’s sci-fi pic In Time fell apart crumbling 59% to an estimated $1.7M and $33.4M overall.George Clooney’s critically-acclaimed film The Descendants became the year’s smallest release to reach the top ten. The Fox Searchlight pic bowed in just 29 locations but grossed an estimated $1.2M for a hefty $42,138 average, putting the awards contender into the number ten spot. Only one other film this year made the top ten by playing in fewer than 500 theaters — Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris, which jumped up to number six in its second frame while in 58 playdates over Memorial Day weekend. The Descendants, a likely Oscar contender in picture, actor, and other races, will quickly expand to most major markets on Wednesday when it reaches over 425 theaters for the long five-day Thanksgiving frame as an alternative option for adult audiences at a time when kidpics will be flooding the marketplace.The top ten films grossed an estimated $215.2M which was up a healthy 17% from last year when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 opened in the top spot with $125M; but down 13% from 2009 when The Twilight Saga: New Moon opened at number one with $142.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"on, films, all-time, Oscars","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Twilight-Destroys-the-Competition"},{"id":"47509127295827","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Real Steel Is the Real Deal","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Real Steel Is the Real DealPlus, The Ides of March finished 2nd, and Dolphin Tale holds onto 3rd.by Gitesh Pandya | October 10, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, Hugh Jackman scored an easy victory over George Clooney in the battle of People magazine’s former sexiest men alive as the robot boxing actioner Real Steel punched up a number one debut well ahead of the political thriller The Ides of March which played in one-third fewer theaters. Overall box office during the Columbus Day holiday weekend was decent but not exceptional with holdovers filling up the rest of the top ten.Topping the charts for six of the last eight weeks, Disney enjoyed another number one hit with the big-budget pic Real Steel which bowed to an estimated $27.3M marking the third largest opening ever over the Columbus Day holiday frame. The PG-13 film starring Jackman averaged a muscular $7,936 from 3,440 theaters and got some help from higher-priced tickets from its 270 IMAX locations. Produced for more than $100M by DreamWorks, Steel follows the sleeper sensation The Help in the Spielberg company’s recent rebound after a string of films that struggled at the box office.Jackman also found good news from the opening as his past non-Wolverine roles have never generated big numbers in the American market. Mixed but generally positive reviews from critics helped but audiences mostly responded to the exciting look of the marketing of the picture. Plus it was the first major action film with broad appeal to hit theaters since the summer. According to studio research, males made up 66% of the audience while 70% were under 35. Real Steel earned an encouraging A CinemaScore grade which could bode well for the long-term run of the film.Overseas, the robotic pic grossed an estimated $22.1M from 19 territories making for a $49.4M global debut. Russia, where the cast and crew traveled to for a lavish premiere, led the way with $6.9M while Jackman’s home country of Australia saw a $5.3M bow. Given that the star and the action genre play much better abroad, Real Steel could continue to post impressive global numbers as it rolls out into more markets. That will be crucial to the film breaking even since the marketing push has been elaborate and pricey.Opening in second place with a good but not stellar performance was the political thriller The Ides of March with an estimated $10.4M from 2,199 theaters for a respectable $4,729 average. The R-rated election pic starring Ryan Gosling, George Clooney (who also directed), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, and Evan Rachel Wood earned very good reviews from critics, however it did not wow paying audiences as the Sony release scored only a B grade from CinemaScore. Ides played exactly like a Clooney vehicle as its gross and average were in line with the actor’s recent films including The American ($13.2M opening, $4,668 average), Michael Clayton ($10.4M, $4,131), The Men Who Stare At Goats ($12.7M, $5,201), and Up in the Air ($11.3M, $5,947). Without Brad Pitt at his side adding extra box office muscle, the polarizing actor/director’s films only sell to so many people.Sony is expecting a strong multiple given the Oscar buzz for Ides and the fact that Clayton also opened to the same gross in mid-October finishing with $49M for a multiple of nearly 5. However, $10M of that figure was collected during the film’s re-release when Oscar nominations were announced. The lawyer flick grossed $39.4M during its initial run giving it a multiple of 3.8 in that period. Sony’s other fall awards contender Moneyball is on course to finish its run with a multiple of about 3.7 while last fall’s well-reviewed dramas The Town and The Social Network enjoyed multiples of 3.9 and 4.3, respectively.Ides, the story of a press spokesman for a presidential candidate who finds himself swept into the vicious world of politics, is a lower cost film so it carries less financial risk thanks to a production cost of only $12.5M. Sony acquired domestic rights to the title for an undisclosed amount and paid for the marketing. Having Clooney and Gosling certainly upped the female interest as exit polls showed that a very high 58% of the audience consisted of women. The thriller skewed much older as 60% was over 35. Over the last three months, Gosling has won raves from critics for his performances in Ides, Drive, and Crazy, Stupid, Love but still eluding him is the abiliity to draw in a sizable crowd at the multiplexes. If Ides succeeds in earning a Best Picture nomination, a January re-release would certainly be possible especially since it would be right at the start of the 2012 presidential primaries.For the third weekend in a row, Seven co-stars Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were side by side on the charts with their inspirational films which have grossed the same amount of money over the last 17 days. The Warner Bros. release Dolphin Tale dropped from first to third with an estimated $9.2M, off 34%, for a $49.1M cume. Sony’s Moneyball fell 38% to an estimated $7.5M giving the baseball drama $49.3M to date. Both look set to end up with around $70M.The cancer comedy 50/50 enjoyed the best hold among last weekend’s four new releases dipping only 36% to an estimated $5.5M. The Summit release has collected a modest $17.3M in ten days and hopes to reach the $30M vicinity. The faith-based fatherhood pic Courageous lost 49% of its crowd and took in an estimated $4.6M giving Sony $15.9M. The low-budget $2M drama is headed for $25M or so.Two-time chart-topper The Lion King 3D followed with an estimated $4.6M tumbling a steep 57% now that the updated film is available in stores on Blu-ray. Still, the re-release has banked an impressive $86M to date boosting the lifetime total for Simba and pals to $414.5M. Later this week, it will surpass the $415M of last year’s Toy Story 3 to reclaim the title of top-grossing animated film ever for Disney. 2004’s Shrek 2 from DreamWorks still holds the crown for all toons with $436.7M.Universal’s spookfest Dream House dropped 45% after its lousy debut to an estimated $4.5M for a ten-day tally of only $14.5M. Falling 44% from its dismal start was the Anna Faris comedy What’s Your Number? which collected an estimated $3.1M and $10.3M across ten days. Final totals should reach $25M and $15M, respectively. Taylor Lautner’s action vehicle Abduction rounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.9M, down 48%, for a $23.4M sum for Lionsgate.The top ten films grossed $79.4M which was up 3% from last year when The Social Network remained in the top spot with $15.5M; but down 14% from 2009 when Couples Retreat debuted at number one with a new Columbus Day weekend record of $34.3M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"superman, school","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Real-Steel-Is-the-Real-Deal"},{"id":"47509128839006","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: New Comedies Can’t Stop Transformers","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: New Comedies Can't Stop TransformersAutobots fend off Horrible Bosses and a Zookeeper.by Gitesh Pandya | July 10, 2011 |  CommentsA pair of star-driven comedies couldn’t keep the 3D juggernaut Transformers: Dark of the Moon from holding onto the number one spot at the worldwide box office as the Autobots held up well for an action sequel coming off of a holiday putting it on course to possibly reach the $1 billion global box office mark. The Michael Bay behemoth grossed an estimated $47M in its second weekend falling 52% from its debut frame – not bad for the third chapter in a sci-fi tentpole franchise. Last weekend’s Friday-to-Sunday take did not include the opening day which helped keep the decline manageable, but still the hold for this type of film was commendable. The third Transformers flick has now banked a stellar $261M in under two weeks making it the top-grossing domestic blockbuster of 2011.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244596[/rtimage]Moon is running 11% behind the pace of the last chapter Revenge of the Fallen which had banked $293.4M in 2009 after its second weekend. A final North American take of $350-360M could result putting Optimus Prime and pals in a position to possibly finish the year as the box office champ. Next weekend, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 invades and will give Transformers a major challenge. Each of the last four installments finished near the $300M mark, though 3D surcharges and fan excitement over the conclusion of the franchise should take this new one higher. Also giving a challenge will be November’s The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 which follows a pair of chapters that also collected about $300M a piece.Overseas, the new Transformers continued its red hot run with an estimated $93M boosting the international take to $384M and the global haul to $645M. Some key markets showed amazing strength like Korea which dipped by 33%, the United Kingdom which slipped only 27%, and Brazil which eased just 29%. However, Russia tumbled 58%, France fell 56%, and Germany dropped 51%. Helped by 3D – both with grosses and audience excitement – Moon looks on track to smash through $600M from outside of North America.Among non-robot films, the raunchy revenge comedy Horrible Bosses led the way opening in second place with strong results to the tune of $28.1M, according to estimates. The Warner Bros. release averaged a sturdy $9,247 from 3,040 theaters with an opening that fell in between recent successful R-rated summer comedies Bad Teacher ($31.6M) and Bridesmaids ($26.2M). With an all-star cast including Jason Bateman, Jason Sudekis, Charlie Day, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Farrell, and Jamie Foxx, Horrible Bosses offered an intriguing concept about three men fed up with their bosses who conspire to kill them. Reviews were mainly favorable helping the film reach its target audience of adults and paying ticket buyers were generally pleased with the product as its CinemaScore grade was a B+.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244594[/rtimage]The Kevin James comedy Zookeeper enjoyed a respectable debut in third place with an estimated $21M from 3,482 theaters for a $6,031 average. Directed by Frank Coraci (The Wedding Singer, Waterboy), the PG-rated entry marks only the second major film for James to anchor solo following the sleeper hit Paul Blart: Mall Cop which debuted to a heftier $31.8M on its way to $146.3M. But the magic didn’t work this time as the critically-panned summer laugher scored a decent debut, but did not reach the kind of heights needed for an expensive $80M comedy. Rosario Dawson co-stars along with the voices of Adam Sandler, Cher, and Sylvester Stallone who take on the roles of the talking animals.Originally produced at MGM with an expensive script, financial turmoil at the studio led to Zookeeper shifting over to Sony. The story of an animal caretaker that gets dating advice from his zoo attractions scored a mediocre B+ grade from audiences polled by CinemaScore. 53% of the crowd was female while 59% was over 25. James did, however, fare better than the last big-name comedian offering an animal-oriented kidpic beating the $18.4M bow of last month’s Mr. Popper’s Penguins. That Jim Carrey project earned better reviews plus a higher CinemaScore grade and is on course to end with 3.5 times its opening weekend tally.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244597[/rtimage]After hitting the brakes in its second lap, the 3D toon Cars 2 stabilized in its third weekend dropping 42% to an estimated $15.2M boosting the 17-day total for Disney and Pixar to $148.8M. That puts it 5% behind the $156.7M of the first Lightning McQueen pic from the summer of 2006. Though a small gap, it will quickly get bigger as the first Cars banked a stronger $23M in its third frame and the Fourth of July holiday didn’t occur until later. Cars 2 looks on course to finish its domestic run in the same vicinity as Ratatouille‘s $206.4M which was the lowest-grossing Pixar film from the last dozen years.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244595[/rtimage]Cameron Diaz’s comedy Bad Teacher followed with an estimated $9M, off a good 38%, for a $78.8M total for Sony. It looks set to become the 11th $100M+ grosser for Diaz. Tom Hanks, another star with a string of hits making it into the century club, saw a large decline for his directorial flop Larry Crowne which fell 52% to an estimated $6.3M. Universal was hoping that the older-skewing dramedy would have legs since mature adults don’t rush out on opening weekend, but bad word-of-mouth ruined the day. With only $26.5M in ten days, Crowne should fizzle out with a disappointing $40-45M by the end of its run.The J.J. Abrams sci-fi hit Super 8 slipped 39% to an estimated $4.8M giving Paramount $118.1M to date. Led by young stars but not filling up theaters, Fox’s Monte Carlo dropped 49% to an estimated $3.8M in its sophomore session. With only $16.1M in ten days, the Selena Gomez vehicle should end up with about $25M.Fading fast, the super hero pic Green Lantern fell 52% to an estimated $3.1M lifting the underwhelming cume for the big-budget production to only $109.7M. Rounding out the top ten was Jim Carrey’s kidpic Mr. Popper’s Penguins with an estimated $2.9M, down 49%, for a $57.7M sum.The critically-acclaimed music documentary Beats, Rhymes and Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest platformed to solid results in just three New York theaters and a solo Los Angeles house grossing an estimated $120,000 for an impressive $30,004 average. Fans rushed out upfront as the opening day accounted for 38% of the weekend – high for a specialty film – while Saturday dropped by 16%. Showered with glowing reviews, the R-rated hip hop film expands Friday to 15 more sites and will continue to reach more markets through August.The top ten films grossed an estimated $141.2M which was down 23% from last year when Despicable Me opened in the top spot with $56.4M; but up 7% from 2009 when Brüno debuted at number one with $30.6M.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"live, Disney, Office, Disney, TCA, Turner, TBS, Guide, and","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-New-Comedies-Cant-Stop-Transformers"},{"id":"47509128827740","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Captain America is Super","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Captain America is SuperHarry Potter, Friends With Benefits round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | July 25, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, the fourth and final super hero film of the summer arrived and like its predecessors, Captain America: The First Avenger also debuted at number one although this one had to defeat the Harry Potter juggernaut in the process. Fellow freshman entry Friends With Benefits, a new sex comedy starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, debuted in third place. In between was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 which suffered a steep fall in its second weekend but still posted a near-record 10-day cume. The overall box office was robust thanks to the recent wave of franchise films.The final piece of the Avengers puzzle fell into its place as Captain America scored a muscular opening weekend with an estimated $65.8M from 3,715 locations for a powerful $17,719 average. If the estimate holds, it will edge out by a slim margin the $65.7M bow of the season’s first comic book pic Thor from the first weekend of May. Both are Marvel films distributed by Paramount and presented in 3D. The extra dimension did not prove to be too popular for Captain America as only 38% of the weekend take came from 3D screens whereas Thor‘s rate was a much higher 60%. With Captain being the ninth 3D film this summer alone, with more still to come, audiences have been growing tired of the format and have become more choosy in selecting which films truly warrant the extra cost.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244935[/rtimage]The super soldier easily beat out the $53.2M opening of last month’s Green Lantern which was also in 3D as well as the $55.1M of the 2D pic X-Men: First Class which like Captain was a period film. Studios took a big risk programming four super hero origin films into a three-month period. Thor has done the best with $180.1M to date and over $445M worldwide while X-Men performed moderately well with $144.2M. Captain America should approach Thor‘s domestic tally although it could be less popular overseas. All three are Marvel projects. The big-budget Green Lantern from DC Comics was the sole casualty with $113.9M to date and little traction from its international openings so far. Next summer is sure to be a record breaker for comic book movies with top characters like Batman, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and the Hulk all returning to the big screen in The Dark Knight Rises (July 20), The Amazing Spider-Man (July 3), and The Avengers (May 4).Directed by Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park III) and starring Chris Evans (Fantastic Four), Captain America skewed to adult men as expected with exit polls showing that the audience was 64% male and 58% over 25. The PG-13 film scored generally positive reviews from critics. Friday kicked off with $25.8M including $4M from Thursday night’s midnight grosses and all-day showings Thursday at a San Diego theater during Comic-Con. Saturday dropped 15% to $21.9M and Paramount is projecting a 17% Sunday slide to $18.2M. An encouraging A- CinemaScore could be good news for the days and weeks ahead. Thor and X-Men, which both did better with critics, each earned a B+ while Green Lantern scored a B.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244936[/rtimage]After breaking almost every box office record in the industry, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 took an understandable freefall in its second weekend since most fans came out already in the first week for the can’t-miss franchise closer. The Warner Bros. title tumbled 72% to an estimated $48.1M boosting the ten-day total to $274.2M. Only studio stablemate The Dark Knight has ever grossed more in the first ten days with $313.8M in July 2008. The last Voldemort pic Part 1 fell 62% in its second weekend, but that tally was helped by Thanksgiving and a Friday that was a day off for most people.Past July Potter films also saw large declines in the second weekend only to stabilize in subsequent weekends with 40-50% declines. The second Hallows is likely to be more front-loaded but the final domestic tally may still end up in the $360-380M range which would give it a shot at surpassing the newest Transformers to become the highest-grossing film of 2011.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244734[/rtimage]Overseas, the wizard film was still doing gangbusters. The international weekend brought in an astounding $121.3M, down 61%, boosting the cume to a jaw-dropping $560.4M That puts the 12-day global haul at a mesmerizing $834.6M. With China still to open on August 4, the final Potter may be able to reach the $1.2 billion mark by the end of its run.The R-rated romantic comedy Friends With Benefits opened in third place with an estimated $18.5M following a long line of raunchy laughers this summer. Though a commendable debut, the figure did not reach the levels of this season’s past offerings like Bridesmaids, Bad Teacher, and Horrible Bosses which all bowed in the $26-32M range. Averaging $6,323 from 2,926 theaters, the Justin Timberlake-Mila Kunis pic about pals that try to keep feelings out of a sex-only relationship may have seen some of its target audience stay away thanks to its similarity to No Strings Attached with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher which basically offered the same story six months ago. That R-rated film bowed to $19.7M on its way to $70.7M. The Friends debut was still good though and reviews were better with many critics highlighting the chemistry between the two leads.Adult women made up the primary audience as studio research showed that 62% of the crowd was female while 56% was over 25. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+. Strong word-of-mouth will be needed as each of the next three weekends will see a new comedy contender for adults enter the marketplace with Steve Carell’s Crazy, Stupid, Love, The Change-Up starring Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds, and the Ben Stiller-produced 30 Minutes or Less.Placing fourth with an estimated $12M was the year’s top-grossing film Transformers: Dark of the Moon which declined by 44% in its fourth battle. The Paramount release has now grossed a brawny $325.8M and is on course to end its domestic run with $350-360M. Shooting with actual 3D cameras has helped it win over more audiences than action films converted in post-production as 3D shares of this weekend’s grosses were 50% for the latest Autobots pic compared to 42% for Potter and 38% for Captain America.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244736[/rtimage]With China re-opening its doors to American films this weekend, Transformers scored a record $40M debut — the best ever for a U.S. picture there. That led the international frame which delivered an estimated $62M allowing the overseas total to climb to $556.6M which represented a new company high for Paramount outside of North America. The latest Michael Bay effort has now grossed a stunning $882.4M worldwide and has Japan opening this coming weekend which will help it pass the billion dollar barrier.Despite the arrival of a new R-rated comedy, the workplace laugher Horrible Bosses held up well again in its third frame dipping only 34% to an estimated $11.7M for a 17-day cume of $82.4M. Warner Bros. will probably see a larger gross with this title than it will with its big-budget gamble Green Lantern which is heading for a $115M final.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244594[/rtimage]Three kidpics with small declines followed. The Kevin James comedy Zookeeper dipped only 29% to an estimated $8.7M and has banked $59.2M in 17 days for Sony. The Disney/Pixar vehicle Cars 2 followed with an estimated $5.7M, off just 32%, for a $176.4M cume. In its sophomore frame, the G-rated toon Winnie the Pooh slipped only 35% and grabbed an estimated $5.1M. The ten-day total for Disney is $17.6M.Adults looking for laughs rounded out the top ten with a pair of popular comedies. The Cameron Diaz pic Bad Teacher fell 50% to an estimated $2.6M bumping its tally to $94.4M for Sony. Sony Classics continued its phenomenal run for Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris which inched up 1% to an estimated $1.9M despite losing 85 theaters. Cume is at $44.9M and will easily break the $50M mark.The top 10 films grossed an estimated $180.2M which was up 20% from last year when Inception remained in the top spot with $42.7M; and up 30% from 2009 when G-Force debuted at number one with $31.7M.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, transformers, rt, composers, comic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Captain-America-is-Super"},{"id":"47509128812378","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Apes Mighty in #1 Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Apes Mighty in #1 Debutby Gitesh Pandya | August 8, 2011 |  CommentsAudiences all hailed Caesar as the primate at the center of the sci-fi prequel Rise of the Planet of the Apes conquered the North American box office with an opening that rose well past industry expectations. Conversely, the latest in this summer’s parade of R-rated comedies The Change-Up generated a lackluster debut finishing in fourth place. But the overall marketplace remained robust thanks to the incredible breadth of titles. For the first time all year, seven different films made over $10M over the weekend.Fox scored another solid top spot debut this summer with a franchise origin story as Rise of the Planet of the Apes soared to an estimated $54M opening weekend. Playing in 3,648 theaters, the PG-13 film averaged a muscular $14,803 and ranked as the third best debut of the summer for a 2D-only film after The Hangover Part II ($85.9M) and X-Men: First Class ($55.1M) which like Apes revisited a popular sci-fi franchise by exploring the origins. Both X-Men and Apes were well-liked by critics.Starring James Franco as a scientist that discovers a way to boost intelligence in chimpanzees, Apes lacked any major starpower and was the twelfth action film of the summer leading to expectations not being too high. But an exciting marketing push and strong reviews helped to spark interest allowing Apes to generate the fifth biggest August opening in history. The new technique of a human actor playing the apes through motion-capture technology created intrigue too. An encouraging A- CinemaScore grade bodes well for the road ahead and next weekend does not have any new action films opening so Rise may not fall the way most pics of this genre do. With a reported budget of $93M, the revenge-against-humans pic got off to a terrific start.Internationally, Rise debuted in 25 markets and bowed to an estimated $23.4M. Most of the markets were not major. Bigger territories like Germany, France, and the United Kingdom open next week.Sony’s family hit The Smurfs enjoyed a terrific hold in its second weekend dropping only 41% to an estimated $21M for a solid ten-day start of $76.2M. With no new choices for parents, and opening weekend audiences spreading positive word-of-mouth all week, the PG-rated comedy remained the most popular item for kids as they near the end of their summer vacations. Smurfs, which can continue using “#1 Comedy in America” in its ads for another week, should find its way past the $125M mark and could go much higher if it continues to show strong August legs. The pint-sized gang made a big splash overseas where it debuted in much of the world this weekend with an estimated $45.2M from about three dozen international territories for a $52.7M cume including the early launch in Spain. The worldwide tally for the $110M production sits at $128.9M.After opening last weekend a bit ahead of Smurfs, the sci-fi Western hybrid Cowboys &amp; Aliens fell a much larger 57% in its second outing to an estimated $15.7M giving Universal $67.4M after ten days. The Daniel Craig-Harrison Ford actioner may break $100M domestically, but won’t go much higher. That makes for a disappointing run for the expensive $163M budgeted production which involved top-tier Hollywood names like Jon Favreau, Steven Spielberg, and Ron Howard. By comparison, Spielberg’s other sci-fi production this summer Super 8 fell by only 39% in its sophomore session after an opening weekend that was about even with Cowboy‘s. With a much more modest $55M budget, that creature feature broke the $200M global box office mark this weekend.Opening in fourth place to disappointing results was Universal’s body-switching comedy The Change-Up which grossed an estimated $13.5M from 2,913 locations for a mild $4,635 average. It was the latest in a long line of R-rated summer comedies and many moviegoers felt they had enough already. Plus bad reviews told audiences that this was not some special film worth taking another trip to the multiplex for. Ticket buyers have already spent an incredible $760M+ this summer on Crazy, Stupid, Love, Friends With Benefits, Horrible Bosses, Bad Teacher, The Hangover Part II, Midnight in Paris, and Bridesmaids. All are comedies aimed at adults, most with R ratings. The Change-Up was too little, too late.Starring Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds as friends with different lives who swap bodies, the raunchy pic carried a cost of $52M which is high for a comedy. Females made up 59% of the audience while those over and under age 30 were evenly split. A discouraging B CinemaScore indicates a rough road ahead, especially with four new releases hitting theaters next weekend including yet another R-rated comedy, 30 Minutes or Less. Bateman and Reynolds both scored $100M+ grossers earlier this summer with Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern, respectively. But Reynolds is surely having a summer he would like to put behind him as Lantern has been a big-budget dud with only $160M worldwide to date. Cameron Diaz has made more with her comedy Bad Teacher which has banked over $180M globally with only a fraction of the budget.Close behind in fifth with an estimated $13M was the super hero flick Captain America: The First Avenger which declined by 49% in its third frame. Paramount’s domestic total stands at $143.2M. International markets brought in an estimated $27.5M this weekend sending the overseas cume into nine-digit territory with $103M for a worldwide gross to date of $246.2M. Marvel’s three-pack of comic book pics this summer – Thor, X-Men: First Class, and Captain America – have now smashed the $1 billion mark in combined global box office. Next summer is sure to be even bigger with The Avengers kicking off the season on May 4 and reboot The Amazing Spider-Man landing on July 3.Ranking sixth was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 which also became the top-grossing global hit of 2011. The final wizard pic dropped 45% domestically to an estimated $12.2M elevating the 24-day total to a massive $342.8M putting it at number 18 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters just behind the latest Transformers. Overseas delivered huge numbers again thanks to a robust opening in China. Official estimates were not available for that market but the studio reported a rough count of $25.5M contributing to the international weekend haul of $61.8M allowing the cume to surge to $791.1M. Potter’s worldwide total rose to a stunning $1.13 billion surpassing the $1.04 billion of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides to become 2011’s number one global grosser. In addition, the 3D franchise closer now ranks third on the all-time worldwide box office list behind the James Cameron duo Avatar and Titanic. A final haul north of $1.3 billion seems likely.A trio of comedies aimed at adults followed. Steve Carell’s Crazy, Stupid, Love held up very well in its second weekend slipping only 37% to an estimated $12.1M for a solid ten-day tally of $42.2M. A final gross in the neighborhood of $75M could result for Warner Bros. Sony’s Friends With Benefits fell a sharp 49% to an estimated $4.7M bringing the 17-day gross to $48.5M. The revenge tale Horrible Bosses followed with an estimated $4.6M, off 36%, for a $105.2M cume for Warner Bros.Falling 51% in its sixth round was the worldwide smash Transformers: Dark of the Moon with an estimated $3M lifting the domestic haul to $344.2M. That puts Michael Bay’s latest robot warfare flick at number 17 on the all-time list. Overseas, the Autobots film kept rising with an estimated $17.5M for an international haul of $693.5M and a mammoth global gross of $1.04 billion. The biggest market outside of the United States continues to be China which has now banked a stunning $137M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $153.8M which was up a healthy 43% from last year when The Other Guys opened in the top spot with $35.5M; and up 22% from 2009 when G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra debuted at number one with $54.7M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter: @giteshpandya","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"78th, Family, Emmy, action, Awards, movie, Cartoon, shows, travel, Association, historical, Black, Islander","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Apes-Mighty-in-1-Debut"},{"id":"47509127292753","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Paranormal Activity 3 Scares Up A Huge Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Paranormal Activity 3 Scares Up A Huge OpeningReal Steel and Footloose round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | October 24, 2011 |  CommentsScaring up more business than the rest of the films in the top ten combined, the horror prequel Paranormal Activity 3 shattered records with its top spot debut proving that the low-budget fright franchise still has a lot of life in it. But despite the massive debut and low declines for most holdovers, the overall box office was still down compared to last year as other newcomers like the adventure film The Three Musketeers and the comedy sequel Johnny English Reborn failed to contribute much to the North American marketplace.Paramount kept growing its found-footage-based horror series as Paranormal Activity 3 opened ahead of expectations with a staggering $54M, according to estimates, leaping 33% ahead of the $40.7M debut that its predecessor enjoyed exactly one year ago this weekend. Landing in 3,321 locations, the R-rated chiller averaged an astounding $16,266 which was a 29% improvement over last year’s installment. Also going up was the production cost from $3M to $5M. While horror films tend to be low cost anyway, the Paranormal films have carried the lightest of budgets with the first pic being made for a cool $15,000.Set in 1988 and telling the story of the sisters from the first two films when they were young girls, Activity 3 kicked off its record scare with $26.3M on Friday including $8M from Thursday night’s 10pm and midnight shows. Saturday dropped 35% to $17.2M and the studio is projecting a 39% fall on Sunday to $10.4M. Part 2 witnessed an identical Saturday decline and a slightly larger 42% fall on Sunday. The $54M weekend figure broke the records for the biggest October opening ever and the best debut for a horror film. Last year’s Paramount double feature of Jackass 3D and Paranormal Activity 2 held those respective records with their bows of $50.4M and $40.7M. It can be argued that films like 2002’s Signs ($60.1M) and 2001’s Hannibal ($58M) were sold as scary movies, but neither was a true horror film.The Paranormal Activity franchise has fully replaced the Saw series as the public’s favorite fright brand during the Halloween season with the first two chapters reaching totals of $107.9M and $84.8M and also seizing the number one spot this very weekend each year. The first Paranormal was a sleeper hit thanks in part to one of the most brilliant marketing and distribution campaigns in recent years that allowed the fear to build over time resulting in it climbing into the top spot in its fifth frame. That forced the latest Jigsaw pic Saw VI to lose fans prompting that franchise’s worst opening ($14.1M) and lowest overall gross ($27.7M). Saw 3D closed out that series last year and Paranormal Activity 3 is now in a marketplace that not only is lacking a Saw competitor for the first time, but has no other horror films whatsoever coming up allowing Paramount to have full control over the market for scary movies this Halloween.Horror threequels are notoriously front-loaded but Activity 3 amazingly saw its opening day account for the same 49% share of the whole weekend gross that part 2 did despite the new installment having many more screens offer the Thursday night shows. Also notable was how the new chapter succeeded in bringing in older adults. The over-25 crowd was 47% of the audience, up from 40% for last year’s installment. The studio credited the very positive reviews it received which again were astonishingly good for a horror threequel. A low C CinemaScore grade, however, meant many fans were underwhelmed with their experience. Activity 2 saw 48% of its total gross come from the opening weekend, however it also faced a new Saw chapter in its second weekend. With a larger opening and weaker competition, Activity 3 may become that rare fright film to top the $100M mark joining the first installment.Paramount rolled out its new chiller into 42 overseas markets this weekend and banked an estimated $26M for a stellar worldwide debut of $80M. The three-part series has now grossed a staggering $450M worldwide in cumulative grosses while the combined production costs have amounted to a puny $8M.Two-time box office ruler Real Steel stepped down into second place but still witnessed a very healthy hold dipping only 31% to an estimated $11.3M. The Disney release has collected a brawny $67.2M in 17 days and could be headed for a final tally in the $90-100M range. Also sliding one spot while enjoying a low decline was the dance remake Footloose which grossed an estimated $10.9M in its sophomore frame for a dip of only 30%. Younger skewing movies typically fade fast but the Paramount pic is generating strong buzz and giving many women a fun, non-violent form of entertainment. A $55-60M final could result.Summit’s 3D period adventure The Three Musketeers struggled in its North American launch opening to just $8.8M, according to estimates, from 3,017 theaters for a dull $2,917 average. The PG-13 film starring an ensemble cast including Milla Jovovich, Orlando Bloom, and Christoph Waltz saw 55% of its gross come from higher-priced 3D screens. With the extra-dimensional format and the cast members holding much more weight around the world, international numbers have been — to no surprise — much stronger. Musketeers has taken in $64.4M overseas so far from more than 50 markets for a global tally to date of $73.2M. The pricey production plans to keep the run going since there have been so few high-profile action titles this fall internationally. Domestically, the swashbuckling pic earned a B CinemaScore grade and played to an audience that was 64% 25 or older and evenly split between males and females.George Clooney’s political thriller The Ides of March held up well again dipping only 31% to an estimated $4.9M for a $29.2M total for Sony. Dolphin Tale followed with an estimated $4.2M, off just 33%, giving Warner Bros. $64.4M to date. Brad Pitt’s baseball pic Moneyball was once again right next to the Morgan Freeman drama and eased only 26% to an estimated $4.1M putting the Sony release at $63.7M overall.The Rowan Atkinson spy sequel Johnny English Reborn failed to connect with American movie fans as the comedy debuted to weak results in eighth place with an estimated $3.8M. The Universal release averaged a poor $2,450 from 1,552 locations and didn’t even reach half of the opening weekend tallies for the actor’s previous films Johnny English and Mr. Bean’s Vacation. Reviews were lackluster. But overseas, where the star and character are much more popular, Reborn vaulted past the $100M mark thanks to an estimated $13.5M frame from 44 territories with 15 international markets still to open. The $45M-budgeted film has now collected $104.5M offshore after a month of play and $108.3M worldwide. Domestically, the PG-rated film played to an audience that was 57% male and included lots of kids and families. The CinemaScore grade was a B.Rounding out the top ten were the horror flop The Thing which plunged 63% to an estimated $3.1M and the cancer dramedy 50/50 which took in an estimated $2.8M slipping only 34%. Totals are $14.1M for Universal and $28.8M for Summit.Outside of the top ten, the inspirational softball drama The Mighty Macs struck out with audiences debuting to only $1.1M, according to estimates, from 975 theaters for a dull $1,090 average. The Carla Gugino starrer was released by Quaker Media and failed to connect with moviegoers the way many other inspirational true stories have this fall.In limited release, the smarthouse thriller Martha Marcy May Marlene enjoyed a solid debut grossing an estimated $138,000 from only two theaters a piece in New York and Los Angeles for a strong $34,500 average. The Fox Searchlight release scored very positive reviews including glowing notices for lead actress Elizabeth Olsen and will expand to ten more major markets on Friday.Roadside Attractions enjoyed a good start for its financial thriller Margin Call which opened wider in 56 locations grossing an estimated $582,000 for a commendable $10,393 average. Reviews were encouraging and the performance was especially impressive given that it was also made available day and date on numerous cable video-on-demand systems plus other digital platforms like iTunes, Amazon, PlayStation, and YouTube.Pedro Almodovar’s latest film The Skin I Live In In fared well in its second weekend expansion grossing an estimated $261,000 from 21 sites for a healthy $12,429 average. The Sony Classics release expanded from its original four playdates and has banked $569,000 so far.The top ten films grossed an estimated $107.9M which was down 8% from last year when Paranormal Activity 2 debuted in the top spot with $40.7M; but up 7% from 2009 when Paranormal Activity climbed into the number one spot with $21.1M.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"cults, nature, Christmas, thriller, mission:, joker, festival, tv, aapi, space, Lucasfilm, game-of-thrones, cats, Holidays, psycho","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Paranormal-Activity-3-Scares-Up-A-Huge-Opening"},{"id":"47509128802136","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Help Helps Itself to #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Help Helps Itself to #1Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Spy Kids round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | August 22, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, the sleeper hit The Help ruled the North American box office in its second weekend climbing into the number one spot beating out four new releases which all stumbled in their debuts. The book-based drama grossed an estimated $20.5M slipping a mere 21% in its sophomore session setting up what will be a long-lasting run into blockbuster territory. The Disney release averaged a stellar $7,613 from only 2,690 theaters and raised its 12-day cume to a solid $71.8M. Help should have no problem making its way to $130M and could even soar much higher beating out many of this summer’s big-budget action offerings. Great reviews and strong word-of-mouth have made it into an event film for adults and appeal has been expanding beyond older females with more demographics discovering the story.After two weekends on top, Fox’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes dropped down to second place with an estimated $16.3M. Off 41%, the sci-fi pic upped its total to $133.8M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10245608[/rtimage]Leading the four-pack of new wide releases was the only kid-friendly one, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D, which generated an estimated $12M from 3,295 theaters for a $3,648 average. Presented in 4D (a 3D film with scratch-n-sniff cards that give off story-related aromas, the PG-rated film played to a family audience but was met with dismal reviews which turned many parents off. Plus the core fan base for the first three films which were released from 2001 to 2003 has grown too old to care anymore so targeting a new generation proved too difficult for the Robert Rodriguez pic.Another new 3D film not exciting moviegoers was Conan the Barbarian which debuted in fourth with an estimated $10M from 3,015 locations for a not-so-muscular $3,317 average. The R-rated remake was the summer’s 13th action film and audiences did not feel that the expensive production was worth the money in the late days of summer. 3D screens did account for a good 61% of the gross for the Lionsgate release though.[rtimage]siteImageId=10245609[/rtimage]Another piece of 1980s nostalgia followed as the horror remake Fright Night did little to attract fans of scary movies opening to an estimated $8.3M. The Disney release invaded an aggressive 3,114 theaters but averaged a weak $2,665 per site. 61% of the gross came from 3D screens which was the one bit of good news. Reviews were mostly favorable, but competition for horror fans came from Final Destination 5 which just bowed last week with its own style of branded 3D chills.Sony’s The Smurfs grossed an estimated $8M, down 42%, boosting the hit film’s cume to $117.7M. The horror sequel Final Destination 5 followed by falling 57% to an estimated $7.7M giving Warner Bros. $32.3M in ten days. A $45-50M final seems likely. 30 Minutes or Less dropped by 53% in its second weekend taking in an estimated $6.3M. With a ten-day sum of $25.8M, look for a $40M final for Sony.[rtimage]siteImageId=10245610[/rtimage]The fourth and final new wide release of the weekend, the Anne Hathaway drama One Day, failed to make much of a dent with women debuting to only $5.1M, according to estimates. The Focus release averaged a mild $2,980 from 1,721 theaters and faced intense direct competition from The Help which has much more must-see buzz surrounding it. Reviews were very negative too.Rounding out the top ten was the comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love with an estimated $5M, off just 30%, for a $64.4M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $99.2M which was down 3% from last year when The Expendables remained in the top spot with $17M; and off 7% from 2009 when Inglourious Basterds debuted at number one with $38.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"animated","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Help-Helps-Itself-to-1"},{"id":"47509127298900","title":"Box Office: It’s Good To Be The Lion King","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: It's Good To Be The Lion KingMoneyball, Dolphin Tale also strong; Abduction, Killer Elite weak.by Gitesh Pandya | September 26, 2011 |  CommentsMultiplexes across North America were busier than normal for this time of year as the hit re-release The Lion King 3D held onto the number one spot for a second frame driving the box office to a new record high for the month of September. Moviegoers also lined up for Seven partners Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as their new releases Moneyball and Dolphin Tale both debuted higher than expected in a close battle for second place. For the first time in history, three different films grossed north of $20M on the same September weekend as the Top 20 soared to a stellar $115M – a new record for the back-to-school month.Thanks to a remarkable sophomore hold, The Lion King 3D ruled over the charts for a second weekend in a row just as the original blockbuster did back in June 1994. The G-rated re-release slipped only 27% and grossed an estimated $22.1M boosting its ten-day cume to a fantastic $61.7M. Despite intense competition for kids and parents, the Hakuna Matata pic remained wildly popular with a wide array of moviegoers allowing it to cling to the number one spot. King’s lifetime total (including 2003’s IMAX release) climbed to $390.2M putting it at number 12 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters.Stunted as a two-week-only event, the updated Lion King is scheduled to leave theaters this Thursday and hit Blu-ray 3D the following week on October 4. However, the studio’s past two-week runs for Toy Story and Miley Cyrus films were extended and the same is expected for Simba given how much money it is still making. Despite its current home video availability, people still want to experience the beloved film on the big screen and many are introducing it to a new generation of children or just reliving their younger days. An extended theatrical run could deposit another $40M+ into Disney’s vault and allow the re-release to surpass the $100M barrier.Actor/producer Brad Pitt clinched second place but still scored a major victory with crtics and movie fans alike with his baseball drama Moneyball which opened to an estimated $20.6M. The Sony release averaged a solid $6,883 per site from 2,993 locations and played to a much older adult crowd although the gender split was about even. Studio research showed that 64% of the audience was over 35 while males made up 51%. Based on the true story of how the 2002 Oakland A’s rebuilt their team after losing their best players, Moneyball earned high praise across the board from film critics. Moviegoers were equally pleased with the PG-13 pic earning a promising A CinemaScore.With strong reviews, stellar word-of-mouth, and an older audience not likely to rush out on opening weekend, Moneyball is well-positioned to enjoy solid legs in the weeks ahead. Baseball is about to start its post-season so the film will remain topical for weeks to come. Plus Pitt is earning plenty of Oscar buzz for his acting performance which will keep the film hot too. Overseas prospects are promising too despite the baseball theme because of Pitt’s incredible box office pull around the world. With a reported $50M production cost, Moneyball may be able to find its way to $250M or more worldwide.Another uplifting film based on a true story opened close behind in third. The Warner Bros. release Dolphin Tale scored big points with audiences collecting an estimated $20.3M this weekend averaging a good $5,777 from 3,507 locations. Playing in 2D and 3D, the PG-rated tale about an injured dolphin and the people who help her saw 50% of its gross come from the extra-dimensional screens. Reviews were very good and audiences loved what they saw giving Tale an amazing A+ CinemaScore grade. Saturday saw a tremendous 70% leap in ticket sales over opening day giving it the best jump in the top ten. Strong legs will keep this feel-good film going in the weeks ahead. Starring Morgan Freeman, Harry Connick Jr., and Ashley Judd, Dolphin Tale’s performance was especially impressive given how much of the family audience is already distracted by The Lion King right now.If none of next weekend’s four new releases truly pop then Moneyball and Dolphin Tale could find themselves in another fierce battle – this time for the number one spot. Breaking the $100M mark this fall is certainly a possibility for each film.Teen girls came out in lukewarm numbers for their favorite shirtless wolf Taylor Lautner who saw an estimated $11.2M opening for his first starring vehicle Abduction. Lionsgate went very wide with the PG-13 thriller going out in 3,118 theaters which resulted in a mild $3,592 average. The distributor rarely releases a film in 3,000+ playdates. Studio research showed that the audience was 68% female and 56% under 25 indicating that the critically-panned film struggled to find appeal outside of its primary young-female quadrant. But at least Lautner found more success than his Twilight co-stars and broke double digit millions. Kristen Stewart’s Adventureland bowed to just $5.7M while Robert Pattinson’s Remember Me debuted to $8.1M. The vampire heartthrob did score a nice hit earlier this year with the romance Water for Elephants which opened to $16.8M, however that film was led by bankable Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon.Rookie distributor Open Road saw a slow start with its first release Killer Elite which posted the worst opening among the four new films this weekend with an estimated $9.5M. The R-rated actioner starring Jason Statham, Clive Owen, and Robert De Niro averaged a weak $3,182 from 2,986 theaters. Its 9% Friday-to-Saturday bump was also the lowest for any freshman flick. Reviews from critics were mostly negative but audiences were somewhat kinder to film which earned a mediocre B grade from CinemaScore.Holdovers rounded out the top ten with mixed results. The virus thriller Contagion held up well with an estimated $8.6M, off 41%, for a $57.1M cume for Warner Bros. All the love showered by critics on the crime drama Drive failed to do much as the FilmDistrict release fell 49% to an estimated $5.8M giving the Ryan Gosling starrer $21.4M in ten days. That may seem like a lot for an art film, but its 2,900-theater release does not come with low P&amp;A expenses. Drive averaged a slow $1,987 per location this weekend from 2,904 sites.The Help followed with an estimated $4.4M, down just 32%, giving Disney $154.4M to date. Sony’s remake Straw Dogs collapsed in its second outing tumbling 59% to an estimated $2.1M and a measly $8.9M in ten days. Also rejected by moviegoers, Sarah Jessica Parker’s comedy I Don’t Know How She Does It dropped 53% to an estimated $2.1M. The Weinstein Co. has taken in a paltry $8M.Gerard Butler’s Africa-set drama Machine Gun Preacher got off to a good start in platform release with an estimated $44,000 from two theaters each in New York and Los Angeles for a $11,000 average. Drawing mixed reviews, the R-rated film expands to 15 major markets on Friday through Relativity Media.The top ten films grossed a September record $106.6M which was up 20% from last year when Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps opened in the top spot with $19M; and up 34% from 2009 when Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs remained at number one with $25M in its second weekend.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Action, video, Superheroe, chucky, Trek, Esquire, Spring, japanese","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Its-Good-To-Be-The-Lion-King"},{"id":"47509127293778","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Real Steel Holds Off Footloose","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Real Steel Holds Off FootlooseAlso, The Thing takes third, and Ides drops to fourth.by Sujit Chawla | October 17, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, the worldwide protests against remakes came out in full force as the robot boxers of Real Steel squeaked out a victory over the 80s remakes of Footloose and The Thing, while the weekend’s other new release The Big Year crashed and burned. Overall the box office dropped nearly 37% from last year.Holding on for a second straight weekend at the top of the charts was the Hugh Jackman robot boxing family drama Real Steel which fell a respectable 40% from last weekend to an estimated $16.3M, bringing its total to $51.7M. With two more weeks before Puss in Boots comes gunning for the family audience, a final in the $90-100M range is likely, with that century mark a definite possibility.The heavily hyped remake Footloose landed in second place this weekend with an estimated $16.1M from 3,549 dance halls, for a per screen average of a so-so $4,536. The film opened at #1 on Friday, but lost steam as the weekend went along and families came out to see Real Steel, which was #1 on Saturday and Sunday. With a CinemaScore of an astounding A, it seems the people who actually went out to see Footloose really liked it, but getting past the stigma of remaking a beloved 80s classic was apparently a bit too much to overcome for Paramount.Another 80s remake landed with a thud in third place as Universal’s horror flick The Thing grossed an estimated $8.7M from 2,996 screens, for a per screen average of a very sad $2,904. Other horror remakes have done reasonably well with tremendously front-loaded opening weekends before falling apart (Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street to name a couple) but it seems the name recognition of The Thing didn’t have quite the cache of the others. With a CinemaScore of a B-, expect The Thing to see a quick trip to DVD.Holdovers took the next five spots on the charts, each falling less than 31% from last weekend. Fourth place belonged to George Clooney with his political thriller The Ides of March which dropped a slim 28% in its second weekend to an estimated $7.5M, bringing its cume to $22M. A final in the $50M range seems likely unless it manages to pick up a bunch of year-end awards, at which point the idea of a re-release (or re-expansion) seems likely to happen, which could push its total higher. Fifth place went to the dolphin tale Dolphin Tale, which took in an estimated $6.3M bringing its total to $58.7M. And the film it’s been running neck and neck with since their openings last month came in close behind in sixth as Moneyball took in $5.5M, according to estimates, seeing its total rise to $57.7MTwo tales of courage took seventh and eighth this weekend. The cancer dramedy 50/50 had the lowest drop in the top 10, falling only 23.7% to an estimated $4.3M, bringing its cume to $24.3M. And the religious-themed Courageous held on well in its third weekend, falling 30% to an estimated $3.4M, bringing its total to $21.4M for distributor Sony.We had to take out a pair of binoculars to see the Steve Martin/Owen Wilson/Jack Black comedy The Big Year on the charts, but there it is, tucked into 9th place this weekend with an estimated $3.3M from 2,150 screens, for a dismal per screen average of $1,547. With a CinemaScore of a B- this is another film that won’t last very long in theaters. Apparently it’s not just sequels and remakes that people are protesting against. Rounding out the top 10 was the animated mega-hit The Lion King which roared its way to an estimated $2.7M in the 5th weekend of its 2-week limited release. Its total for the re-release is $90M, with its overall total now at $419M, putting it at #9 on the all-time blockbuster list, just ahead of Disney stablemate Toy Story 3 ($415M in 2010) and just behind yet another Disney film, 2006’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest ($423.3M).Outside of the top 10, Sony Picture Classics had a limited release for the Pedro Almodovar thriller The Skin I Live In starring Antonio Banderas. Released on only 6 screens, the film grossed an estimated $231,000 for a scorching per screen average of $38,500.The top ten films grossed $74.2M which was down 36.6% from last year when Jackass 3D opened in the top spot with a new October record of $50.4M; and down 40.5% from 2009 when Where the Wild Things Are debuted at number one with $32.7M.Compared to projections, Footloose, The Thing and The Big Year all debuted below Gitesh’s respective predictions of $20M, $13M and $6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"park, doctor, Disney+, disaster, Masterpiece, on","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Real-Steel-Holds-Off-Footloose"},{"id":"47509128833885","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Harry Potter Breaks Weekend Records","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Harry Potter Breaks Weekend RecordsPlus, Transformers falls, and Winnie the Pooh debuts at No. 6.by Gitesh Pandya | July 18, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, box office records of all kinds were demolished by the wildly anticipated franchise closer Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 which generated the biggest opening in Hollywood history. The eighth and final chapter in the decade-long fantasy series opened to an eye-popping $168.6M from North America, according to estimates, plus an additional $307M from overseas markets which began running the film on Wednesday leading to a scorching worldwide launch of $475.6M. All three figures broke the all-time records beating The Dark Knight‘s $158.4M domestic opening weekend in July 2008, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides‘ $260.4M international bow this past May, and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince‘s $394M global debut in July 2009.Domestically, the new Potter also smashed records for the best ever midnight launch with $43.5M on late Thursday night including 3:00am shows that many theaters added, and a colossal $92.1M opening day including those midnights. The previous records were held by the Twilight franchise with last summer’s Eclipse having a $30M midnight bow and 2009’s New Moon posting a $72.7M first day. Like a boxer unifying multiple titles, Harry Potter pulled off a remarkable feat setting new box office records in five major categories.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244733[/rtimage]The new Potter installment opened ultrawide in 4,375 theaters – including a record 274 IMAX venues – and was the first in the franchise to be presented in 3D which helped to boost the grosses. As with most action epics, North American moviegoers were less interested in the 3D conversion as 43% of the weekend gross came from the extra-dimensional screens while overseas the rate was much higher at 61%. The domestic per-theater average stood at a sturdy $38,526.The concluding chapter’s opening weekend was a healthy 35% bigger than the $125M bow last November of Part 1 which was in 2D and went on to finish with $295M. The first seven Potter films have grossed a sizzling $6.36 billion worldwide and the franchise now sits at $6.84 billion with the launch of the final saga. The series will shatter the $7 billion mark in a matter of days.Critics and audiences both loved the new Deathly Hallows. Reviews were not only among the best for the series, but also rank as among the most positive for any wide release this year. Warner Bros. will be hoping that the regular Oscar attention it receives for the wizard franchise will this time go beyond the technical categories and into other areas including Best Picture. Moviegoers polled by CinemaScore gave the PG-13 pic an overall A grade. This does not necessarily mean the film will have legs as Potter pics are always heavily front-loaded with this one being even more so.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244734[/rtimage]The historic frame began with the stunning $92.1M Friday which included the intense demand from fans to see right away how the saga ends on the big screen. Saturday sales crumbled by a very high 54% to $42.9M which did not come close to breaking the record for the largest Saturday. Spider-Man 3 still holds that distinction with $51.3M from May 2007. The studio estimated a 22% dip on Sunday to $33.6M. With such upfront demand, Friday accounted for a whopping 55% of the three-day gross.IMAX also broke domestic and global records with the new Hallows. Fans spent $15.5M from the North American sites beating the $12.2M of last weekend’s Alice in Wonderland and $23.5M from 394 screens worldwide beating the most recent Transformers which did $20.4M. The previous recordholders were also in 3D.Being a global phenomenon, it was no surprise that grosses around the world were sensational for Harry’s last stand with nearly a half-billion dollars collected in just five days. The jaw-dropping $307M overseas debut came from 20,000 screens across 59 countries with China still to come on August 4. Leading the way this weekend (with different numbers of days depending on local launches) were the United Kingdom with $36.6M, Australia with $26.7M, Germany with $25.7M, France with $23.9M, and Japan with $21.5M. Like in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia set all-time opening weekend records too.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244735[/rtimage]Despite rising ticket prices over the years, the first film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (Philosopher’s Stone overseas) still holds the series records for total domestic and worldwide grosses with $317.6M and $970M, respectively. Those could crumble too as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 may find its way north of $325M from North America and $1 billion globally.Michael Bay took a hit by the teen wizard as his latest action juggernaut Transformers: Dark of the Moon fell 55% in its third frame to an estimated $21.3M. But the latest Autobots film burst through the triple century mark finishing the weekend at $302.8M. Declines for previous chapters when a new Potter debuted were lower with 48% in 2007 and 44% in 2009. However, both of those Hogwarts films debuted on a Wednesday diluting the weekend figures. With both new chapters of Transformers and Harry Potter being in 3D, the fight for those special screens also played into this weekend’s showdown.With rival summer action films Captain America: The First Avenger, Cowboys &amp; Aliens, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes opening over each of the next three weekends, more large declines are likely in the weeks ahead putting Dark of the Moon on course to finish with about $360M domestically. Overseas, Transformers felt the heat of Hogwarts too with the weekend take falling 58% to an estimated $39M. With the international cume now up to $460M – a new high for the franchise thanks in part to 3D prices – the global tally surged to a stunning $762.8M with China and Japan still to open. Korea has led all overseas markets with $61.6M to date.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244736[/rtimage]The Warner Bros. comedy Horrible Bosses held up quite well in its second weekend grossing an estimated $17.6M for a relatively low 38% decline. The R-rated workplace pic has banked an impressive $60M in just ten days and could end up breaking the $100M mark. Fellow sophomore comedy Zookeeper fared well too dipping only 39% to an estimated $12.3M. Sony has taken in $42.4M in ten days with the expensive Kevin James project and could be on the way to around $75M.A pair of G-rated toons from Disney followed. The Pixar sequel Cars 2 fell 45% to an estimated $8.3M for a $165.3M sum to date. By comparison, the first Cars enjoyed a $14.6M gross in its fourth lap. Breaking $200M may be a tough mission to accomplish for Mater and pals who may end closer to the $190M mark. The Mouse House saw a soft debut for its well-reviewed animated tale Winnie the Pooh which debuted to an estimated $8M from 2,405 locations for a mild $3,326 average.The Cameron Diaz comedy Bad Teacher dropped 42% to an estimated $5.2M giving Sony a solid $88.5M to date. Diaz’s My Best Friend’s Wedding co-star Julia Roberts, who is also on screen now as a bad teacher, followed with the Tom Hanks film Larry Crowne which suffered another steep fall sliding 57% to an estimated $2.6M. Universal has collected a mere $31.6M to date.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244737[/rtimage]Rounding out the top ten with estimates of $1.9M each were the sci-fi drama Super 8 and the Woody Allen comedy Midnight in Paris. The Paramount actioner tumbled 60% with Potter‘s arrival putting the cume at $122.2M. The Sony Classics release dipped only 28% and has taken in $41.8M so far making it the veteran director’s all-time top-grossing film passing the $40.1M of 1986’s Hannah and her Sisters. Of course, Hannah and films like Annie Hall and Manhattan all sold a much larger amount of tickets.New domestic totals for top summer grossers outside the top ten include $251.9M for The Hangover Part II, $237.3M for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, $209.1M for Fast Five, $179.5M for Thor, $161.3M for Bridesmaids, $160.1M for Kung Fu Panda 2, $143.4M for X-Men: First Class, $112.7M for Green Lantern.The top ten films grossed an estimated $247.7M which was up a potent 46% from last year when Inception opened in the top spot with $62.8M; and up a huge 65% from 2009 when Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince debuted at number one with $77.8M over the weekend and $158M over five days.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"fiction, Company, E3, comedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Harry-Potter-Breaks-Weekend-Records"},{"id":"47509128874851","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: X-Men Is First Class","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: X-Men Is First ClassThe Hangover Part II and Kung Fu Panda 2 round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | June 6, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend Fox rebooted its mutant super hero franchise and scored a top spot launch with the comic book pic X-Men: First Class which stood as the frame’s only new wide release. The PG-13 film debuted to an estimated $56M over the weekend from 3,641 theaters for a solid $15,380 average. It was in line with other Marvel super hero films of the same type, most notably 2008’s reboot The Incredible Hulk which debuted to $55.4M in June of that summer. Both followed films that were widely disliked and featured new directors, cast, and storylines in hopes of winning back fans.First Class also reached about the same number of people as last month’s Thor which bowed to $65.7M which included higher-priced tickets from 3D and IMAX screens that helped to boost the grosses. Take out those extra fees and the two films were very close in opening weekend sales. The new X-Men was only presented in 2D and lacked any big star names that would attract a broader crowd like Thor‘s Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243797[/rtimage]The new tale that documented the origins of Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto played to an adult male crowd. Studio research showed that 58% of the audience was male while 54% was over 25. Reviews were terrific while the CinemaScore grade from paying moviegoers was just a decent B+.First Class attacked most of the international marketplace this weekend and hauled in an estimated $64M from 74 territories for a robust $120M worldwide debut. The first four X-Men films showed steady growth in the international share of the global total and the latest installment is continuing that trend with 53% of its global opening coming from overseas this weekend.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243622[/rtimage]Following its record-breaking holiday opening, the comedy sequel The Hangover Part II tumbled 62% in its second weekend to an estimated $32.4M lifting the 11-day total to a hefty $186.9M. The drop was understandable given the upfront demand for the Warner Bros. film and the fact that it was coming off of a holiday. The Bangkok-set film is on track to finish in the neighborhood of $250M. Overseas, the Hangover pic took in an estimated $62M thanks to new openings in Germany and Russia. The international cume rose to $151.5M while the worldwide tally stands at $338.4M.Kung Fu Panda 2, the other sequel that launched over Memorial Day weekend, grossed an estimated $24.3M falling by a moderate 49%. Paramount has banked $100.4M after 11 days and looks headed for the $160M vicinity from North America. Overseas, the Jack Black vehicle took in an estimated $40M giving the 3D toon an international total of $125M and $225.4M worldwide.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243625[/rtimage]Continuing with its rapid erosion domestically and hefty numbers overseas was Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides which approached the $800M global mark. The Johnny Depp adventure fell 55% to an estimated $18M for a North American cume of $190.3M. The international take was still huge with $69.4M this weekend bumping the massive total to $600.4M. Worldwide, the latest Pirates is at a towering $790.7M with a hearty 76% coming from offshore.Kristin Wiig scored her first $100M+ grosser as a lead with Bridesmaids which still showed fabulous legs with an estimated $12.1M, off only 27%, for a $107.3M total. Universal’s sleeper hit now looks likely to reach $140M if not more.The pair of action hits that kicked off the summer movie season followed. Paramount’s Thor dropped 56% to an estimated $4.2M while Universal’s Fast Five grabbed an estimated $3.2M falling 49%. Totals are now $169.1M domestic and $427.1M worldwide for the super hero flick and $202.1M and $568.6M for the racing sequel.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243626[/rtimage]Still doing stellar business in limited release was Woody Allen’s indie comedy Midnight in Paris which is expanding nicely with an estimated $2.9M from 147 playdates. The Sony Classics film averaged $19,837 and raised its sum to $6.9M with many more markets yet to open.Wedding comedies that have been side-by-side on the charts rounded out the top ten. Sony’s Jumping the Broom grossed an estimated $865,000, down 53%, while Something Borrowed fell 55% to an estimated $835,000 for Warner Bros. Cumes are $35.9M and $36.7M, respectively.Opening to good results in platform release was the Ewan McGregor pic Beginners which bowed to an estimated $135,000 from only five sites for a $27,000 average. Focus will expand throughout June. Fox Searchlight saw a strong expansion for its Terence Malick film The Tree of Life which widened from four to 20 theaters for a weekend estimate of $621,000 and a solid average of $31,050. Total is $1.3M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $154.9M which was up a healthy 29% from last year when Shrek Forever After remained in the top spot for a third time with $25.5M; but off 2% from 2009 when The Hangover debuted at number one with $45M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Grammys, anthology, streaming, Pictures, Walt, The, TV, spider-man, superhero, Esquire, Review, Emmys, Purge","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-XMen-Is-First-Class"},{"id":"47509128867682","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Super 8 Captures #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Super 8 Captures #1 SpotGo Super 8 OK.by Gitesh Pandya | June 13, 2011 |  CommentsExceeding expectations, the new kid-driven monster movie Super 8 shot straight to number one at the North American box office while fellow newcomer Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer failed to make a dent with a weak debut in seventh place. Most holdovers fared well as the overall marketplace fell from last year’s numbers, but only by a small margin.Paramount scored a hit with its 1979-set sci-fi action-drama Super 8 which opened impressively with an estimated $37M this weekend from 3,379 theaters for a solid $10,950 average. The PG-13 film about a group of middle school kids trying to solve the mystery behind a train crash that unleashes a creature in their small town had no starpower and instead relied on the brand names of director J.J. Abrams and producer Steven Spielberg who both worked overtime promoting the $50M production. The studio opened the film one day early in over 300 theaters on Thursday, including all 239 IMAX sites, and grossed an estimated $1M that day giving Super 8 a cume of $38M. IMAX accounted for 12% of the gross, or about $4.5M and a sparkling $19,000 average.Reviews were mostly positive and the marketing campaign purposely held back much about the film so audiences would be intrigued and then experience all the excitement inside the theater. It was a risky move in today’s world of information overload, but it paid off. Opening day audiences gave the creature feature a B+ grade which was good, but not exceptional. But Saturday sales rose 15% from $12.2M to $14M. Even for an original film with no real built-in audience, it indicates a promising road ahead.Super 8 played much older than most other films in the marketplace. The audience was 71% over 25 and 56% male which was similar to the crowd for the well-reviewed summer action entry Thor which played 72% over 25. The Abrams film did better with cross-gender appeal as Thor was 63% male. Older moviegoers do not rush out on the first weekend as much as younger ones do and with an original non-franchise film like Super 8, there could be substantial sales still to come.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243962[/rtimage]The opening of Super 8 was very close to the $37.4M debut of another recent one-word-one-number summer monster movie – 2009’s District 9. Though it was rated R, took place in another country, and was centered on adult characters, the Sony film won praise from critics with an original story about regular people coping with odd beasts in their town. That film fell 51% in the second weekend before ending its run with a terrific $115.6M – a little more than three times its opening.Overseas, Super 8 had a limited bow in just nine markets with Australia being the only major one. The estimate was $6.7M and next weekend will see the first major overseas showing with numerous marketing opening including Russia and Korea.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243960[/rtimage]Dropping from number one in its second weekend was the super hero reboot X-Men: First Class which fell by an understandable 55% to an estimated $25M giving Fox $98.9M in ten days. The PG-13 origin flick earned good reviews and positive buzz which helped it hold up relatively well for this type of film. Plus it had a competing sci-fi film also playing to adult men to deal with. It was a smaller drop than the 60% fall that Universal witnessed in June 2008 with its Marvel reboot The Incredible Hulk and beat out the 59% slide that Fantastic Four suffered in July 2005. However it was larger than the 47% dip that Thor experienced last month in its sophomore session. That pic introduced a brand new character to the screen and did not have a major action film opening against it in the second weekend. Look for the domestic total to end with around $140M. The overseas weekend brought in an estimated $42.2M, down just 33%, for a $124.2M cume and $223.1M worldwide tally.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243958[/rtimage]The Bangkok mayhem of The Hangover Part II attracted an estimated $18.5M worth of business for a reasonable 41% fall in the third session. Warner Bros. smashed the $200M mark on Friday after just 16 days setting a new speed record for live-action comedies. The old record of 19 days was held by 2004’s Meet the Fockers. The new Hangover pic has now reached an impressive $216.6M in 18 days and could be headed past $260M. Global audiences are also having fun with the hungover boys as holdover markets overseas dropped by just 37%. The weekend brought an estimated $38.3M pushing the international take past the double century mark as well to $215.5M. Worldwide, The Hangover Part II has grossed $432.1M. While the film’s domestic final may end a bit short of its predecessor’s, the international figure has already zoomed past the $191.6M of the first Hangover.Despite facing two new films with kids as their lead characters, the animated comedy Kung Fu Panda 2 held up very well dropping only 30% to an estimated $16.6M in its third weekend. The Paramount/DreamWorks title has now banked $126.9M in 18 days and could be headed past the $170M mark. Panda opened at number one in 17 international territories fueling a strong $56.5M offshore frame lifting the overseas gross to $205M and the global take to $331.9M. Top spot bows this weekend in the U.K., Mexico, and Brazil helped keep the global roll-out going and an amazing hold in China has propelled the local total to a stellar $71.2M. The Panda sequel debuts in a number of European markets next weekend including France and Germany. Adding foreign to domestic, Kung Fu Panda 2 was the world’s most popular film this weekend.Dropping 40% to fifth place was Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides with an estimated $10.8M boosting Disney’s take to $208.8M. The latest Johnny Depp adventure is the second biggest domestic grosser of the year behind the Wolf Pack, however overseas business remained red hot with the film collecting an estimated $41.1M boosting the international haul to an eye-popping $678M. That makes Tides the sixth biggest blockbuster of all-time overseas. By the end of the week, the Fountain of Youth pic will sail past the $690.1M of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and the $690.2M of Depp’s own Alice in Wonderland to take the number four spot trailing only the third Lord of the Rings and a pair of James Cameron megahits. The new Pirates now stands at a towering $886.8M worldwide with a steep 77% coming from overseas and the one billion mark likely within reach. Top international markets are Japan ($74.5M), Germany ($66.7M), China ($65.2M), Russia ($60.7M), and the United Kingdom ($48M).For the fourth straight weekend, Bridesmaids posted the lowest decline in the top ten slipping a mere 16% to an estimated $10.2M. If the estimate holds, the Kristin Wiig hit will become the only film of 2011 to gross over $10M for five weekends. With $123.9M, the Universal sleeper hit is cashing in on great word-of-mouth as more audiences continue to discover the raunchy wedding comedy. Bridesmaids should have no problem breaking the $150M mark now and may even reach the $164M of The Proposal from two summers ago which was PG-13.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243957[/rtimage]Stumbling into seventh place with an estimated $6.3M in its opening weekend was the tween girl comedy Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer which didn’t excite too many kids. The PG-rated film starring Jordana Beatty and Heather Graham averaged a weak $2,483 from 2,524 theaters and could not carve out a big audience despite being based on a popular series of books. The budget was under $20M with producer Smokewood Entertainment paying that plus the marketing tab. Relativity distributed the critically-panned film in the U.S. for a fee. The overall CinemaScore grade was a B+ and females made up 78% of the audience. Playing mostly to moms and daughters, Judy generated 88% of its business from children under 12 plus their parents.After three sizzling weeks in limited release, Woody Allen’s new hit comedy Midnight in Paris accelerated its expansion plan and went nationwide this weekend taking in an estimated $6.1M from 944 locations for a good $6,511 average. Sony Classics has taken in $14.2M to date and could have a lot more to go as it positions the Owen Wilson starrer as an alternative choice for mature adults in a marketplace dominated by sci-fi actioners, sequels, and kidpics. Critics have been singing praises so the PG-13 film could enjoy good legs in the weeks ahead as buzz spreads and the long Fourth of July holiday weekend approaches.Rounding out the top ten were the summer kickoff films that went head-to-head around the world. The 3D comic book pic Thor fell 44% to an estimated $2.4M for $173.6M to date for Paramount with $434M worldwide. Universal’s bigger hit Fast Five grossed an estimated $1.7M, off 46%, putting the domestic cume at $205.1M and the worldwide tally at a muscular $583.4M. The Vin Diesel vehicle is now the third biggest domestic grosser of the year but second highest globally behind only the Pirates sequel.Top-tier specialty films continued to perform well as they expanded to more markets. Terence Malick’s The Tree of Life starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn went from 20 to 47 theaters and grossed an estimated $875,000 for a solid $18,617 average for Fox Searchlight. Focus widened its Ewan McGregor pic Beginners from five to 19 playdates and collected an estimated $255,000 for a $13,421 average. Totals stand at $2.4M and $465,000, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $134.6M which was off 4% from last year when The Karate Kid opened in the top spot with $55.7M; but up 4% from 2009 when The Hangover remained at number one with $32.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"winner, History, Reality, Review, of, what, Originals, book, chucky, TIFF, romantic, Nickelodeon","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Super-8-Captures-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509130433384","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Fast Five Finishes First","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Fast Five Finishes FirstProm and Hoodwinked Too! don't fare so well...by Gitesh Pandya | May 2, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, the summer movie season got off to an early and explosive start with the record-breaking debut of the action sequel Fast Five which raced to the top of the North American box office with an opening that was miles ahead of any other film’s from this year. But the two other new offerings were flat out rejected by ticket buyers as the high school comedy Prom and the 3D toon Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil sparked no interest from audiences. Overall ticket sales were up sharply versus last year which came as great news for the industry which is trying desperately to generate momentum going into the potent month of May.Universal scored the biggest opening in studio history with Fast Five which debuted to a stunning $83.6M, according to estimates, leading the marketplace with a sturdy 54% market share. The PG-13 film averaged a muscular $22,950 from 3,644 theaters including a record 243 IMAX sites where tickets cost as much as $19 each. 10% of the weekend gross came from those large-format screens. The opening was critical for Universal which has struggled over the last couple of years at the box office. Fast Five broke the long-standing opening weekend record for the studio which was set back in May 1997 by Steven Spielberg’s The Lost World which took in $72.1M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of its Memorial Day weekend launch setting the all-time industry record at the time. Of course, ticket prices were much lower back then.[rtimage]siteImageId=10242969[/rtimage]By bringing back the main cast members of the first movie – 2001’s The Fast and the Furious – the franchise got re-energized two years ago when the fourth installment Fast &amp; Furious opened to a stunning $71M proving there was still solid interest in the franchise. Fast Five improved on that by an impressive 18% and plans are developing for a sixth installment. Universal made sure it was offering something new and exciting by reuniting stars Vin Diesel and Paul Walker with actors from previous chapters like Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‘Ludacris’ Bridges, and Sung Kang. Plus the sequel got taken to another level with the casting of Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson creating a high-octane testosterone vehicle that had to be experienced on the big screen. Critics helped out too giving what were by far the best reviews the series had seen yet.Fast Five also generated the biggest opening ever in April, beating out Fast &amp; Furious, and more than doubled 2011’s previous best debut – Rio‘s $39.2M. During the January-to-April periods in 2009 and 2010 there were five films each year that opened north of $40M. This year saw none until Five rolled in.The busy weekend started off with $34.5M on Friday including $3.7M from Thursday night’s post-midnight showtimes. The Brazil-set heist film then fell 12% on Saturday to $30.2M which was commendable given that the last film in the franchise tumbled 19% on Saturday. Universal is estimating a 37% Sunday decline to $18.9M. Five earned a great A CinemaScore grade as fans have been liking what they have been seeing. The usual sophomore tumble is likely next weekend, especially since rival action entry Thor is opening, but good word-of-mouth may prevent the declines that the last Furious suffered.[rtimage]siteImageId=10242970[/rtimage]Produced for $125M after counting tax rebates and other incentives, the adrenaline-pumping actioner played to an audience that was 56% male, 52% under 25, and 65% non-Caucasian. Overseas, Fast Five was a big ticket item too and grossed an estimated $45.3M from just 14 markets boosting the international total to $81.4M and the global gross to $165M with much more to come. All ten new markets opened at number one including Russia, Germany, and Spain. Even more encouraging for Universal, the new chapter posted franchise record debuts everywhere just as it did domestically meaning the road ahead is lucrative for the series. 45 more international territories open next weekend as Fast Five may have enough fuel to reach the $500M mark worldwide.Moviegoers wanting a less violent trip to Brazil lined up for the animated hit Rio which fell to second after two weeks at number one and grossed an estimated $14.4M. The 3D film dropped by only 45% and crossed the century mark after 17 days of release with a cume to date of $103.6M for Fox. A trajectory towards about $140M seems likely as no films aimed at families will open over the next two weeks. Rio‘s overseas total has now climbed to $263M putting the global take at $366M with a whopping 72% coming from outside of North America. Brazil, home to the director and the film’s setting, has contributed a stellar $36M to date.[rtimage]siteImageId=10242971[/rtimage]Tyler Perry suffered a predictable 60% sophomore fall for his latest comedy Madea’s Big Happy Family which ranked third with $10.1M, according to estimates. Lionsgate has banked $41.1M in ten days and should end up with $50-55M. The Reese-and-Robert romance Water for Elephants followed with an estimated $9.1M dropping by a moderate 46% in its second round. Fox has collected $32.3M in ten days and should finish with about $55M as well.The weekend’s two new releases not involving high-speed theft both stumbled at the box office failing to excite moviegoers. Disney’s high school comedy Prom bowed to an estimated $5M from 2,730 locations for a weak $1,832 average. The PG-rated story about teens preparing for their big dance was aimed at the tween audience and girls in particular. Reviews were not too strong and Prom had no major star to anchor the project.Parents told Hollywood that there are way too many 3D toons these days by ignoring the animated sequel Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil which debuted in sixth place with an estimated $4.1M from 2,505 theaters. Averaging a dismal $1,653, the PG-rated follow-up to The Weinstein Company’s 2006 hit lacked must-see buzz and faced intense competition from other kidpics like Rio. Critics also savaged the Hoodwinked sequel.[rtimage]siteImageId=10242972[/rtimage]Sony’s inspirational drama Soul Surfer held up nicely again slipping 39% to an estimated $3.3M for a sum of $33.8M so far. The horror hit Insidious fell to an estimated $2.7M, down 48%, and has grossed $48.3M for FilmDistrict.Box office gravity caught up with the hit kidpic Hop. After surging last weekend in its fourth frame thanks to the Easter holiday, the Universal release plunged 79% this time to an estimated $2.6M for a cume to date of $105.3. Rounding out the top ten was the action pic Source Code with an estimated $2.5M, off 50%, and a $48.9M total.Overseas, Paramount’s super hero epic Thor made a mighty splash opening in dozens of major markets with an estimated $83M from 56 territories making for the year’s top wide international debut weekend. The pricey 3D action pic opened last weekend in star Chris Hemsworth’s home country of Australia and dipped 42% this weekend in its second frame for a sizable local cume of $13.1M. Fast Five fell a similar 41% in its second round Down Under and has taken in $20.9M. Thor has raked in a total of $93M from all markets so far and will invade well over 3,500 theaters across North America this Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $137.4M which was up a mighty 56% from last year when A Nightmare on Elm Street opened in the top spot with $32.9M; but down 6% from 2009 when X-Men Origins: Wolverine kicked off the summer debuting at number one with $85.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TCA, king, show, Paramount, venice, documentary, Hulu, Paquin, Trophy, Columbia, Animation, Kimmy, Kids, deadpool","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Fast-Five-Finishes-First"},{"id":"47509130443628","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hop Rules First April Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hop Rules First April WeekendSource Code, Insidious open to decent numbers.by Gitesh Pandya | April 4, 2011 |  CommentsNew releases all fared well as the April box office kicked off with the Easter-themed hit Hop which powered its way to number one playing well to family audiences. Older adults drove the action thriller Source Code to a second place debut while fright fans lined up for the new horror pic Insidious which finished in third. But overall ticket sales continued to struggle as last year’s top four films alone grossed more than all films this weekend combined.Universal delivered the biggest opening ever for a kidpic in April with its Easter Bunny flick Hop which bowed to an estimated $38.1M. The PG-rated hybrid of animation and live-action averaged a potent $10,650 from a very wide launch in 3,579 theaters and connected with its target audience of children and their parents with a debut that exceeded pre-release expectations. Universal and its promotional partners attacked the marketplace from all angles with marketing tie-ins designed to engage consumers – and especially those all-important decision-making moms – in numerous ways. The estimate matched the bow of Rango which currently holds the record for 2011’s largest opening weekend. Final numbers to be released on Monday will determine if the rabbit film can edge Johnny Depp’s lizard toon.With no huge stars appearing on screen or providing voices, the $63M-budgeted Hop was promoted as being from the producer of Despicable Me and the director of Alvin and the Chipmunks. Those overachievers grossed a combined $469M from North America alone and were crowd-pleasers with kids so families felt safe coming out for this new offering. A familiar Easter Bunny storyline and colorful trailers helped too as did a release date a few weeks before the family-friendly holiday. With a CinemaScore grade of A- and no new kidpics slated for next weekend, the road ahead looks promising although the 3D toon Rio will cause a major distraction on April 15. Overall, Hop enjoyed the fifth-biggest opening ever for April which generally is a slow month at multiplexes.The well-reviewed sci-fi film Source Code opened in second place with an estimated $15M from 2,961 theaters for a good $5,076 average. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a soldier that takes multiple trips back in time in hopes of preventing a train disaster, the PG-13 film attracted some of the best reviews of the year for an action film and debuted just a few notches behind recent adult-skewing thrillers like Limitless ($18.9M), The Adjustment Bureau ($21.2M), and Unknown ($21.9M). But its B CinemaScore suggests that the coming weeks may not be smooth sailing. Produced for $32M, Source Code played to older men with studio research showing that 54% of the audience was male and 64% was over 30.New distributor FilmDistrict got off to an encouraging start with its first release, the horror picture Insidious, which bowed to an estimated $13.5M in third place. The PG-13 chiller averaged a good $5,605 from 2,408 locations and took advantage of a severe lack of competition as 2011 has barely seen any scary movies be released. Marketed as being from the makers of Paranormal Activity and Saw helped it to reach its target audience and the rating certainly broadened the appeal to younger teens looking for a non-gory scare. Reviews were quite good for this genre and Saturday sales enjoyed a 12% bump – something not often seen with horror titles. Insidious debuted ahead of expectations establishing FilmDistrict as a distributor to watch for.Tumbling 57% from its top spot debut was the kidpic sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules which took in an estimated $10.2M in its second weekend for fourth place. The Fox release, which cost just $20M to produce, has grossed a solid $38.4M in ten days and is headed for the vicinity of $55M, or just slightly below the $64M of its predecessor from last spring.The Bradley Cooper-Robert De Niro hit Limitless followed with an estimated $9.4M, off only 38%, for a $55.6M total in 17 days for Relativity. Lionsgate’s Matthew McConaughey legal drama The Lincoln Lawyer also held up well in its third round slipping only 34% to an estimated $7.1M for a $39.6M cume to date. Both films are benefiting from strong word-of-mouth.On the other hand, audiences abandoned the stylish action fantasy Sucker Punch which collapsed in its sophomore outing falling a steep 68% to an estimated $6.1M. The pricey $75M production has banked just $29.9M in ten days and is not likely to collect much more with a $35-40M final likely for Warner Bros. Rango, the year’s top-grossing title, dropped 53% and took in an estimated $4.6M pushing Paramount’s sum to $113.8M.Alien flicks Paul and Battle: Los Angeles were once again neighbors on the box office chart and this time rounded out the top ten. Universal’s comedy collected an estimated $4.3M, down 45%, and has taken in $31.9M to date. Sony’s action pic fell harder with a 54% decline to an estimated $3.5M. The invasion film’s domestic total stands at $78.5M while the overseas tally crossed the century mark this weekend with $100.7M putting the global cume at $179.2M.In limited release, Sony Classics platformed this year’s Oscar and Golden Globe winner for best foreign language film In A Better World in four sites in New York and Los Angeles and grossed an estimated $35,400. The Danish film averaged a respectable $8,850 per theater and earned mostly good reviews from U.S. film critics. The bullying drama played numerous film festivals like Toronto and Sundance and was released in Scandinavia last fall.The top ten films grossed an estimated $111.8M which was down a sizable 33% from last year when Clash of the Titans opened in the top spot with $61.2M; and off 24% from 2009 when Fast &amp; Furious debuted at number one with $71M. The two films still stand as April’s biggest opening weekends by a wide margin.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"curtis, Purge, parents, supernatural, Awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hop-Rules-First-April-Weekend"},{"id":"47509130441579","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hop Stays On Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hop Stays On TopArthur and Hanna round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | April 10, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend Universal’s hit kidpic Hop became the first film of 2011 to spend back-to-back weeks at number one as the bunny pic fended off competition from four new wide releases to remain the most popular film in North America. Its star Russell Brand also claimed second place with his comedy remake Arthur making the British comedian that rare star to hold the top two spots at the box office. The frame’s other debuting titles had mixed results with the teen girl-led films Hanna and Soul Surfer faring well while the raunchy fantasy comedy Your Highness failed to make much of a splash. As usual, the overall box office was down by double digits compared to last year.Dropping a reasonable 42% in its second turn with moviegoers, Hop grossed an estimated $21.7M boosting its ten-day total to a healthy $68.2M. The Universal release cost only $63M to make so the studio has a solid moneymaker on its hands that could possibly find its way to $120-130M from North America alone. So far the animation/live-action hybrid is following the same path as Johnny Depp’s Rango from early March. After a similar $38.1M debut, the lizard toon declined by 41% putting its ten-day tally at the exact same figure as Hop’s. Rango now sits at $117.5M after its sixth session on its way to $120M+. Hop follows an eleven-week streak of new films opening at number one each frame.Russell Brand’s Arthur remake finished in second place for the weekend thanks to the widest release of any new title and grossed an estimated $12.6M. The PG-13 redo of the 1981 Dudley Moore hit averaged a lackluster $3,848 per theater from 3,276 locations. Slammed by critics, the Warner Bros. release was meant to bring the story of a rich lovable drunk playboy to a younger audience by using the British comic as the anchor. But unfunny trailers and Brand’s not-so-sizable box office power led Arthur to a disappointing debut as moviegoers stayed away for the most part. The actor’s only other lead role in a film came in last summer’s Get Him To The Greek which carried an R rating and bowed to a better $17.6M on its way to $61M. Arthur co-starred Helen Mirren and Jennifer Garner who also failed to contribute commercial muscle. Though it ranked second overall, the comedy placed fifth in the top ten when comparing per-theater averages. The reported production budget was $40M with a hefty marketing tab added on top of that.Focus landed in third with a commendable performance from its new action title Hanna which debuted to an estimated $12.3M from 2,535 playdates. The PG-13 espionage thriller averaged $4,861 and was the only action film in the top five. Starring Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett, the pic earned strong reviews from critics which helped it appeal to upscale adult audiences looking for something without talking bunnies or bumbling drunks. Few films are anchored by a teen girl assassin so the fresh feel and the strong marketing push helped Hanna stand out as an option paying top dollar for.The inspirational family drama Soul Surfer exceeded expectations and debuted in fourth with an estimated $11.1M. Posting the best average among the new titles, the PG-rated true story of a teen surfer who gets her life back on track after a shark bites off her arm averaged a good $5,014 from 2,214 sites. Sony’s TriStar unit handled distribution while FilmDistrict took marketing duties. Starring AnnaSophia Robb, Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt, and superstar singer Carrie Underwood in her film debut, earned mixed reviews from critics. Moms and daughters made up a big portion of the audience. Exit polls showed that a whopping 80% of the crowd was female and 56% was under 25. Soul Surfer earned an A+ grade from CinemaScore which is rare these days so word-of-mouth should allow the pic to play well for the rest of the spring season especially with the Easter holiday still to come.The horror film Insidious posted a shockingly low second weekend decline of only 27% and ranked fifth with an estimated $9.7M in ticket sales. Fright films routinely lose over half of their opening weekend take in the sophomore frame so this result is indeed rare. With a solid $27.1M in its first ten days, rookie distributor FilmDistrict’s first release could find its way to an impressive $50M or more. With Insidious, four of the top five films had one-word titles.Faring worst among the weekend’s four new wide releases was Universal’s fantasy comedy Your Highness which bowed to an estimated $9.5M from 2,769 locations for a dull $3,438 average. The R-rated action laugher starring Danny McBride, James Franco, and Natalie Portman tried to attract older teens and young adults by mixing an effects-driven Medieval quest with crude sexual humor but failed to impress. The $50M production skewed towards young men with 58% of the audience being male and 55% being 25 and older. A weak C+ CinemaScore and horrible reviews indicate a fast fade in the weeks ahead. Saturday sales dropped 9% while all other new releases – even rival comedy Arthur – enjoyed increases.The sci-fi thriller Source Code dropped 39% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.1M. Holding up well despite plenty of competition, the Summit release has grossed $28.6M in ten days and looks headed for a $50M finish. Relativity’s action pic Limitless fell by an identical 39% to an estimated $5.7M boosting the impressive cume to $64.4M.The kidpic Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules tumbled 51% to an estimated $4.9M giving Fox $45.5M to date. Lionsgate’s The Lincoln Lawyer enjoyed another moderate drop with an estimated $4.6M, off only 33%, for a $46.5M sum rounding out the top ten.New films in limited release did not fare very well over the weekend. The IMAX 3D animal documentary Born To Be Wild debuted in 206 locations and took in an estimated $850,000 for a mild $4,126 average per site. The G-rated pic about orangutans and elephants was narrated by Morgan Freeman. Running only 40 minutes in length, Born played to regular ticket prices despite being an IMAX 3D presentation. Many exhibitors were able to squeeze in seven or eight showtimes per day meaning each showing attracted just 20-25 people. Reviews were terrific across the board. Lionsgate released the Spanish-language romantic comedy No Eres Tu, Soy Yo (It’s Not You, It’s Me) in 226 theaters but averaged a weak $2,655 with its estimated $600,000 take.The top ten films grossed an estimated $101.2M which was down 14% from last year when Clash of the Titans remained in the top spot with $26.6M; and off 17% from 2009 when Hannah Montana The Movie debuted at number one with $32.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Superheroes, service, fresh, Disney, PlayStation, renewed","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hop-Stays-On-Top"},{"id":"47509130425189","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Pirates Attacks With Huge Global Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Pirates Attacks With Huge Global DebutJack gets some nice booty.by Gitesh Pandya | May 22, 2011 |  CommentsJohnny Depp and his jolly pals seized control of the North American box office with the adventure tentpole Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides which registered the year’s biggest opening while internationally the latest Captain Jack saga commanded much more power smashing records with the largest overseas opening of all-time. Most holdovers suffered large drops, however the hit comedy Bridesmaids took advantage of sensational buzz to post a fantastic hold putting it on track to break the $100M mark.&nbsp;Disney scored its first number one hit of the year with the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series which opened with an estimated $90.1M from an ultrawide launch in 4,155 theaters for a mighty $21,685 average. The PG-13 pic was the first in the franchise to be presented in 3D and the grosses were also helped by a record launch in 256 IMAX locations which charged as much as $20 per ticket. Opening on the lower end of industry expectations, Tides enjoyed the biggest opening of 2011 beating the $86.2M of last month’s Fast Five which was only in 2D but did include IMAX sales. But moviegoers were cautious with their dollars as less than half of the Tides weekend gross came from 3D screens with more opting for the 2D version.&nbsp;The Tides bow was down 22% from the $114.7M debut of the last installment, At World’s End. But that figure was part of the long Memorial Day holiday session and the film was the cliffhanger finale after 2006’s massively successful Dead Man’s Chest. Widely disliked by many critics and fans, End prompted many moviegoers to skip the new chapter which also featured a new director in Rob Marshall and new cast members Penélope Cruz and Ian McShane while bringing back fan favorites Geoffrey Rush and Depp who stands to collect one of the largest compensation packages in Hollywood history since ticket buyers would not show up without him. Reviews were mostly negative and a moderate B+ CinemaScore grade suggests that the road ahead should be on par with what tentpole sequels normally see.&nbsp;[rtimage]siteImageId=10243451[/rtimage]Starting out the weekend, Friday took in $35M including $4.7M from Thursday night’s post-midnight shows. Saturday dipped by only 8% to $32M – good for a poorly-reviewed fourth chapter of an action series – and Sunday is estimated to drop by only 28% to $23.1M.&nbsp;What Tides lost out on domestically, it more than made up for in international waters which have always been friendly to this franchise. Since attacking its first wave of markets on Wednesday, the new Pirates grossed a stunning $256.3M over five days overseas setting a new all-time record by beating the five-day $236M launch of 2009’s Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. 3D and IMAX certainly helped as did several star-studded red carpet premieres in Cannes, London, Madrid, Munich, and most importantly Moscow. Russia, which is fast becoming one of Hollywood’s most important overseas markets, led all international territories with an eye-popping $28.6M over five days (an all-time industry record) which already is more than what the last Pirates did there during the entire life of its run. Look for more action tentpoles to plan premieres in the Russian capital.&nbsp;Another emerging market that was red hot was China where Tides opened to a robust $20M in three days which again is already better than the local lifetime take of the last Pirates which co-starred Chow Yun-Fat. Russia and China delivered the top two overseas openings for Tides beating out the usual big three – Japan, Germany, and the U.K. – which contributed $18-20M each during their respective debut periods. Significant film industry growth in Russia and China since 2007 when the last Captain Jack flick opened is now being taken advantage of.&nbsp;Globally, Tides hauled in a massive $346.4M since Wednesday making it the fourth largest worldwide launch of any film behind Half-Blood Prince ($394M) and the 2007 threequels Spider-Man 3 ($381.6M), and At World’s End ($357.2M). It should be noted that these figures include openings on different days in different countries so they are not for the exact same time periods.&nbsp;Clearly, Disney was looking at the world and not specifically the U.S. when developing and marketing On Stranger Tides. The first three Pirates saw an increasing share of the global gross come from overseas from the 53% of Curse of the Black Pearl, to the 60% of Dead Man’s Chest, to the 68% of At World’s End. Tides, which cost a reported $250M to produce, will likely see more than 70% of its worldwide haul come from outside North America and another global tally north of $900M could certainly result.&nbsp;The wedding comedy Bridesmaids officially became a sleeper hit thanks to its incredible second weekend hold. Kristin Wiig’s raunchy R-rated pic dipped by only 20% and collected an estimated $21.1M lifting Universal’s ten-day tally to a robust $59.5M. The sophomore gross was more than what most expected from the first weekend. The decline was less than those seen by past leggy R-rated comedies like Wedding Crashers (24%), The 40-Year-Old Virgin (24%), and The Hangover (27%). Instead, the Bridesmaids drop was identical to the decline seen by 2003’s Old School which made 49% of its overall total in the first ten days, though it was earlier in the year when college students were in school during weekdays. The Wiig pic has the benefit of having a major holiday next weekend so it could be on course to finish with at least $125M giving Universal its third $100M+ grosser in two months after Hop and Fast Five.&nbsp;[rtimage]siteImageId=10243449[/rtimage]Rival action films fell sharply against Pirates which stole away numerous 3D and IMAX screens. Paramount’s Thor dropped 55% in its third frame to an estimated $15.5M giving the super hero saga $145.4M in 17 days. The street racing sequel Fast Five raced past the $500M worldwide mark this weekend thanks to terrific business overseas. Domestically, the Universal hit grossed an estimated $10.6M, down 48%, pushing the 24-day sum to $186.2M. Overseas markets kicked in an additional $25M this weekend putting the offshore tally at $320M bumping the global gross to a stellar $506.2M.&nbsp;[rtimage]siteImageId=10243448[/rtimage]Finishing in fifth was the 3D toon Rio with an estimated $4.7M, down 44%, for a $131.6M total for Fox. Sony’s supernatural thriller Priest collapsed in its second weekend tumbling 69% to an estimated $4.6M giving the vampire pic $23.7M in ten days. A $30M final seems likely.&nbsp;[rtimage]siteImageId=10243447[/rtimage]A two-pack of wedding comedies followed. Off 48%, Jumping the Broom grossed an estimated $3.7M for Sony while Something Borrowed fell 50% for Warner Bros. Totals are nearly identical after 17 days standing at $31.3M and $31.4M, respectively.&nbsp;The Fox romance Water for Elephants placed ninth with an estimated $2.2M, down 49%, giving the Reese Witherspoon film $52.4M to date. Rounding out the top ten was Lionsgate’s comedy Madea’s Big Happy Family which dropped 55% to an estimated $1M for $51.8M overall.&nbsp;Making a spectacular debut in platform release was Woody Allen’s latest romantic comedy Midnight in Paris which opened in the number twelve spot nationwide despite playing in only six theaters. The Sony Classics release collected an estimated $579,000 for a jaw-dropping average of $96,500. Starring Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, and Adrien Brody, the PG-13 film opened only in four New York houses and a pair of Los Angeles sites and earned glowing reviews from critics. All theaters had multiple screens offering up to 20 showtimes daily. Midnight expands to 29 more theaters on Friday for the holiday weekend including markets such as San Francisco, Chicago, Minneapolis, Boston, and Washington D.C.&nbsp;[rtimage]siteImageId=10243450[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $156.8M which was up 11% from last year when Shrek Forever After opened in the top spot with $70.8M; but down 7% from 2009 when Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian debuted at number one with $54.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the Memorial Day holiday session.&nbsp;Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"OWN, BAFTA, canceled, Cannes, award, fast, worst, Universal, show, emmy, Western, streaming, hispanic, globes, target","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-pirates-attacks-with-huge-global-debut"},{"id":"47509132354425","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Narnia Leads Lackluster Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Narnia Leads Lackluster WeekendAlso, The Tourist nabs #2, and Black Swan opens wide.by Gitesh Pandya | December 13, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, two big-budget new releases topped the North American box office but moviegoers were not too enthusiastic about either one. Debuting at number one was the fantasy sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader while the Johnny Depp-Angelina Jolie spy flick The Tourist opened in second place. The overall marketplace remained sluggish as ticket buyers continued to wait for that one blockbuster that truly excites them.The third installment in the Narnia franchise opened at number one with an estimated $24.5M but failed to reach even half of the debut weekend grosses of its two predecessors. Released by Fox and presented in 3D, the new chapter averaged $6,892 from 3,555 locations. Openings for the first two 2D films, which were distributed by Disney, were $65.6M for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from this same weekend in 2005 and $55M for Prince Caspian from May 2008. Dawn Treader even opened below the $25.8M of 2007’s The Golden Compass, another effects-heavy fantasy adventure debuting in early December. That pic failed to triple its opening weekend and ended its domestic run with $70.1M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239211[/rtimage]December films tend to have better legs than those released in the other eleven months since holiday shopping makes moviegoing a lower priority earlier in the month and the Christmas holidays boost attendance in the final week. But sequels and films with built-in audiences tend to have weaker legs. Fox reported that the audience for Dawn Treader was broad with 51% being female and 52% being under 25. The CinemaScore was a good A-. Overseas markets saw much better results with an estimated $81M for a healthy global bow of $105.5M. The production cost was an estimated $150M.Opening in second place was the Johnny Depp-Angelina Jolie vehicle The Tourist which collected an estimated $17M from a more narrow release in 2,756 theaters for a similar $6,168 average. Boasting more starpower than what should be allowed by law in Hollywood, the PG-13 pic tells of an American math teacher visiting Venice who is lured into a dangerous world by a seductive British agent. The Sony release earned lackluster reviews and instead was sold on the star wattage of the leads who are undoubtedly among the world’s most popular superstars.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239212[/rtimage]But with a generic story that wasn’t properly explained in the trailers, audiences hesitated. The debut for the $100M-budgeted pic fell a little short of the star-driven spy pic Knight &amp; Day from this past summer which bowed to $20.1M and a $6,501 average on its way to $76.4M. Tourist also debuted with less than half of the $36M that Jolie’s last film Salt opened to in July. A weak B CinemaScore indicates a shaky road ahead. Exit polls showed that the crowd was 55% female and 53% over 30.Rapunzel dropped from first place but the 3D toon Tangled held up well sliding only 33% to an estimated $14.6M in its third weekend. Disney has grossed $115.6M to date with its hit princess pic and the road may lead to about $175M after the holidays.Dropping 50% in its fourth round was the wizard hit Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 which took in an estimated $8.5M lifting the 24-day cume to $257.7M. It was the lowest fourth-weekend gross for any film in the long-lasting franchise despite the fact that it enjoyed the highest ticket prices. The last film Half-Blood Prince did $8.9M in August 2009 while the last holiday season chapter Goblet of Fire managed $10.3M in December 2005 which coincidentally also featured the top spot debut of a Narnia film. The first 24 days accounted for 84% of Goblet‘s $290M total and 89% of Prince’s $302M final. Even with the Christmas and New Year’s holiday boosts around the corner, Deathly Hallows still looks on course to finish its domestic run at or just shy of the $300M mark.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238691[/rtimage]Denzel Washington’s leggy action hit Unstoppable dipped 37% in its fifth frame to an estimated $3.8M with Fox’s sum rising to $74.3M.Fox Searchlight orchestrated a wildly successful expansion of its awards contender Black Swan by widening from 18 to 90 theaters and jumping up to number six. Films with so few theaters almost never get this high on the charts. The Natalie Portman ballet thriller grossed an estimated $3.3M for an incredible $37,022 average becoming only the second film of the last two years to crack the national top ten while playing in less than 100 theaters. Cyrus, the distributor’s indie comedy hit from July, was the other. With more cities to come this Friday, and with Portman likely to score awards and nominations from various industry groups in the days and weeks ahead, look for Swan to remain a major box office force in the long-term. So far, it has beaten the numbers of last December’s Up in the Air which was released in a similar manner over the same weeks with better averages on the first weekend ($80,212 vs $78,763) and second ($37,022 vs $33,255).Sony’s musical Burlesque followed with an estimated $3.2M, down 48%, for a $32.6M tally to date. Fox’s comedy Love and Other Drugs grossed an estimated $3M, down 47%, and put its total at $27.6M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238692[/rtimage]Comedies rounded out the top ten with the Robert Downey Jr. film Due Date taking in an estimated $2.5M, down 38%, for a $94.9M cume and the 3D toon Megamind dropping 49% to an estimated $2.5M raising Paramount’s total to $140.2M.Paramount generated an explosive platform debut for its Oscar hopeful The Fighter starring Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale which grossed an estimated $320,000 from just four theaters in three markets for a scorching $80,000 average. Based on a true story of half-brothers that were both boxers, the R-rated film played in New York and Los Angeles plus Boston and Lowell, Massachusetts which is where the brothers are from. Reviews have been very positive and Bale is already being touted as the front-runner to win all the Best Supporting Actor trophies this awards season. Rather than expand the film gradually and let word-of-mouth build over time, the studio is quickly going nationwide on Friday into more than 2,200 theaters over a very competitive frame that will see rival films Tron: Legacy, How Do You Know, and Yogi Bear all entering the ring. The Fighter is hoping for some Golden Globe nominations this week as it goes into its wide break.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239213[/rtimage]Disney platformed Miramax’s Helen Mirren-led The Tempest in five theaters and bowed to an estimated $45,000 for a solid $9,000 average.

Also generatingmuscular results by bringing a property with a large built-in fan base to thebig screen was TheLast Airbender which counter-programmed Bella and company by appealingto boys resulting in a strong finish in the runner-up spot despite some of theyear’s worst reviews. With Toy Story 3 stillattracting large crowds, the overall marketplace swelled delivering spectacularresults to kick off the second half of 2010.Summit’s crown jewel kept getting bigger. Eclipse,the third installment of the lucrative five-film Twilight franchise,debuted to heated anticipation and generated a stunning $161M in ticket sales inits first five days of release from Wednesday to Sunday, according to estimates.The figure consisted of $92M during the week on Wednesday and Thursday and $69Mover the Friday-to-Sunday period. The weekend figure, which matched the debut ofthe first Twilight pic from 2008, was deflated by the mid-week bow whichpushed the intense upfront demand to Wednesday, but the overall extended startis truly remarkable. Summit is estimating another $20M on Monday which is aholiday for many bringing the six-day tally to an estimated $181M which,conveniently, would break the record for the biggest Fourth of July openingedgiing past the $180.1M six-day score of Spider-Man 2 from 2004 when thecalendar was exactly the same. Ticket prices have risen significantly sincethen, though.[rtimage]MapID=1210749&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=35&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Still,the PG-13 Eclipse flexed major muscles with a stellar $68.5M on Wednesdaybecoming the second largest opening day in box office history trailing just the$72.7M Friday of The Twilight Saga: New Moon from last November. Eclipseset a new benchmark as the widest release ever playing in 4,468 locations. Theweekend average hit $15,443. Exit polls showed a broadening of the audience withthe new pic’s crowd being 65% female compared to 80% for New Moon.Eclipse was also the first in the series to play on IMAX screens which helpedout the grosses too. That format has pulled in a remarkable $8.2M to date from193 playdates.Overseas, Eclipse was red hot too with an estimated $100.2M sinceWednesday from 42 territories with major markets like the UK, France, Germany,Japan, and Korea still to come. New Moon grossed $709M worldwide and thisnew saga could beat it.M. Night Shyamalan enjoyed the best opening – and total gross – for any film insix years with the 3D fantasy adventure The Last Airbenderwhich debuted in second place with an estimated $40.7M over theFriday-to-Sunday period. The PG-rated film based on the popular Nickelodeoncartoon series aveaged a sturdy $12,827 from 3,169 locations and has collectedan impressive $58M in its first four days since its Thursday launch. Paramountreported an early five-day estimate of $70M for the extended Thursday-to-Mondaydebut which would put it ahead of the director’s last two films The Happeningand Lady in the Water which grossed $64.5M and $42.3M, respectively.All three share a common trait – they were all panned by critics. Airbender,with a reported production cost of $150M, has been met with the worst reviews ofthe filmmaker’s career, but the target audience of young males came out onopening weekend anyway for the special effects and the franchise’s brand name. Alate-in-the-game upgrade to 3D added to the ticket prices too. Despite whatshould be large declines in the days and weeks ahead, market share leaderParamount should still score its fifth $100M+ grosser of2010.[rtimage]MapID=1213190&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=45&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Bumped downto number three over the holiday weekend was Toy Story 3 whichpulled in an estimated $30.2M in its third frame. Down 49%, the Disney/Pixarsensation watched its cume soar to an amazing $289M putting it at number 42 onthe list of all-time domestic blockbusters behind the $290M of 2005’s HarryPotter and the Goblet of Fire. Toy Story 3 could shatter the $300M mark onMonday after only 18 days and may still reach the $400M barriertoo.[rtimage]MapID=1196045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=42&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Adam Sandlerand his comedy pals landed in fourth with Grown Ups whichgrossed an estimated $18.5M, down an understandable 54%. The decline was similarto the 52% fall the funnyman’s 1999 hit Big Daddy suffered in its secondweekend when Independence Day also fell on a Sunday. Grown Ups could beheaded for a final tally in the neighborhood of $140M proving that Sandler stillhas what paying audiences want.[rtimage]MapID=1223577&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=27&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Onthe other hand, Tom Cruise is learning that moviegoers are losing interest inhim as his latest entry Knight and Dayis turning into one of the lowest-grossing action films of his career. The Foxrelease dropped 49% to an estimated $10.2M this weekend and lifted its 12-daysum to only $45.5M. Knight is on course to end its run in the samevicinity as Cruise’s 1990 summer action pic Days of Thunder which made$82.7M at a time when the average movie ticket price was just $4.23.80s remakes followed as The Karate Kidtook in an estimated $8M in sixth while the less successful The A-Team collectedan estimated $3M in seventh place. Sony’s Jaden Smith pic dropped 49% and hastaken in a stellar $151.5M to date and Fox’s action title upped its total to$69.1M after declining by 51%.Universal’s hit comedy Get Himto the Greek tumbled 62% to an estimated $1.2M raising its cume to$57.4M.

With no other movies opening in wide release, most holdovers in the top ten remained strong with three enjoying drops of less than 30%. The top ten generated the best showing over the Halloween or pre-Halloween frame in six years thanks in part to a pair of 3D sequels in the top five charging higher ticket prices.Lionsgate trapped audiences over the pumpkin frame with Saw 3D which opened to an estimated $24.2M from 2,808 locations for a potent $8,618 average. The R-rated torturefest enjoyed a healthy 71% boost over the weak $14.1M bow of last October’s Saw VI which was crushed by competition from the first Paranormal Activity movie. The new Jigsaw flick was slotted into the calendar a week after Paranormal Activity 2 so it would have less competition. Saw 3D’s debut was well below the $40.7M launch of the latest Activity.As one of the most popular fright franchises of all time, Saw 3D supposedly marks the end of the series. Being the so-called “final chapter” was a key part of the marketing campaign as was the extra dimension. First shows for the seven-quel began on Thursday at 8:00pm, but Lionsgate chose to bundle those ticket sales into the Friday figure which was $10.7M which included $1.7M from Thursday night. But the Thursday night take cannot be fully removed from the Friday figure since it includes shows from 12:01am onwards which are considered part of Friday. Saturday fell a sharp 26% to $7.9M while Halloween Sunday is estimated to drop by 30% to $5.6M. Saw 3D was not screened for the press ahead of time, but critics that reviewed it upon release slammed the film with some of the worst reviews of the series.Following its terrifying top spot debut last week, the supernatural sequel Paranormal Activity 2 tumbled 59% to an estimated $16.8M claiming the second spot over Halloween weekend. Paramount’s ten-day total stands at $65.7M and a final gross of $80-85M looks possible. Though the new demon flick won’t match the $107.9M of last year’s first Paranormal, it will still end up extremely profitable thanks to a slim $3M production cost. Marketing expenses were extra. The thriller’s sophomore drop is in line with how horror sequels perform, especially when another fright flick enters the marketplace.Holding steady in third place was the action-comedy Red starring Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman with an estimated $10.8M in its third weekend. The Summit release slipped only 28% thanks to great word-of-mouth and has taken in a strong $58.9M in 17 days. At its current pace, a final tally of $80-90M seems likely.Paramount’s hit sequel Jackass 3D broke through the $100M mark this weekend with the help of 3D surcharges. Johnny Knoxville and pals took in an estimated $8.4M, down 61%, and boosted the cume to $101.6M after just 17 days. Produced for under $20M, Jackass has easily beaten the $64.3M and $72.8M final totals of the first two films in the series. All three have sold roughly 11 million tickets, though the new pic’s admissions figure is still rising.Clint Eastwood isn’t seeing the kind of audience love he normally gets for his latest film Hereafter which fell 47% to an estimated $6.3M for a total of $22.2M to date. The director often enjoys strong legs for his films but his latest is not getting strong word-of-mouth and Matt Damon’s name is doing little to bolster the numbers. A disappointing $35-40M final seems likely for Warner Bros.On the other hand, Disney’s feel-good horse movie Secretariat continues to show exceptional legs thanks to positive buzz and little direct competition. The Diane Lane starrer slipped only 28% in its fourth lap to an estimated $5.1M raising the total to $44.8M.The David Fincher hit The Social Network followed with an estimated $4.7M, off 35%, for a $79.7M cume for Sony. The comedy Life As We Know It declined by 35% to an estimated $4M and lifted its cume to $43.5M.Warner Bros. stablemate The Town made off with an estimated $2M in its seventh weekend dropping only 29% for a $87.6M total to date. Jumping into the top ten for the first time was Hilary Swank’s legal drama Conviction which expanded in its third weekend from 55 to 565 theaters grossing an estimated $1.8M. The Fox Searchlight film averaged a mild $3,230 and has collected $2.4M thus far.Opening with decent but not stellar numbers in limited release was the Swedish film The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest which bowed to an estimated $915,000 from 153 theaters for a moderate $5,980 average. The third installment in the acclaimed Millennium trilogy enjoyed a wider North American launch than its predecessors. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo debuted in 34 sites in March while the first sequel The Girl Who Played With Fire debuted in 110 locations. Reviews were mixed for Hornet’s Nest.The top ten films grossed an estimated $83.8M which was up 8% from last year when This Is It opened in the top spot with $23.2M; and up 21% from 2008 when High School Musical 3: Senior Year stayed at number one for a second weekend with $15.3M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"toy, dramedy, E!, movie, 2019, versus, rt, universal, Larson, Britbox, Paramount","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Saw-3D-Traps-The-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509132373885","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Megamind Seizes #1 Spot Over Busy Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Megamind Seizes #1 Spot Over Busy WeekendDue Date and Colored Girls deliver.by Gitesh Pandya | November 8, 2010 |  CommentsThe holiday movie season started off with a bang as three new releases pumpedin over $100M in ticket sales allowing the top ten to surge to its highest levelsince July. Leading the charge was the animated comedy Megamind whichdidn’t have a mega opening, but still delivered a solid debut at number one.Premiering in second place with strength was the R-rated comedy Due Date while theTyler Perry film For Colored Girls enjoyed a sturdy debut of its own in third place.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238235[/rtimage]DreamWorks Animation scored its third number one 3D hit of the year with the Will Ferrellvehicle Megamindwhich bowed to an estimated $47.7M from 3,944 locations for a strong $12,082average. The PG-rated film earned generally good reviews and played to a broadaudience of families and young adults. Tina Fey andBrad Pittalso lent their voices to the tale of a supervillain who discovers how to be agood guy. The opening was only slightly better than the $43.7M debut of thestudio’s March release HowTo Train Your Dragon, which had less star wattage but much betterreviews, and well below the $59.3M of its 2009 offering Monsters vs.Aliens. All were 3D toons that took advantage of higher ticket pricesalthough Megamind arguably had the most starpower. The company’s Shrek Forever Afterdebuted to $70.8M in May, however it was a franchise film with a built-inaudience.Even older non-sequel Pixar films launching on the first weekend of November didbetter than Megamind like the $70.5M of 2004’s The Incrediblesand the $62.6M for 2001’s Monsters Inc.Ticket prices were much less back then and they didn’t benefit from 3Dsurcharges. In fact looking at admissions, the superhero toon Incrediblessold twice as many tickets on opening weekend than the blue supervillain.Paramount and DreamWorks invested heavily into the film’s extensive marketingcampaign but the long-term picture does look bright. 3D toons tend to have goodlegs and play amazingly well overseas and having Brad Pitt involved certainlywill give a boost around the world. A final global gross in the area of $500M ormore is certainly possible.Those looking for more racy laughs lined up for the R-rated road trip comedy Due Date whichdebuted in second place with terrific results grossing an estimated $33.5M.Playing in 3,355 sites, the Warner Bros. release starring RobertDowney Jr. and ZachGalifianakis averaged a muscular $9,985 per location. Reviews were nottoo upbeat and certainly did not match those for director ToddPhillips‘ last film The Hangoverwhich enjoyed a bigger debut with $45M in June 2009. Starpower and a priceymarketing tab helped to open Due Date, but word-of-mouth will decide thefate from here on out.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238234[/rtimage]Tyler Perryventured into new territory by directing someone else’s story and making anR-rated film with For Colored Girls which debuted in third place with an estimated $20.1M.The Lionsgate release averaged a stellar $9,450 from 2,127 locations and likethe filmmaker’s prior work played heavily to black adult women. According tostudio data, 82% of the crowd was female, 87% was over 25, and 81% was AfricanAmerican. Based on the popular play, Girls covered disturbing subjectmatter but brought out a large targeted audience thanks to the brand names ofthe director and the play, plus starpower from cast members likeJanet Jackson,Thandie Newton,PhyliciaRashad, andWhoopiGoldberg. The gross was just somewhat below the $23.4M bow of Perry’s lastfall release I Can DoBad All By Myself from last year.Leading all the holdovers was the four-week-old geezer action hit Red which slipped only18% to an estimated $8.9M boosting the cume to a sturdy $71.9M. The Summitrelease now looks to have a shot at breaking the $100M mark. Tumbling 66% in itssecond weekend was the horror sequel Saw 3D which fell fromfirst to fifth with an estimated $8.2M. Recent installments have generated about80% of their totals in the first ten days so with $38.8M in the bank so far, theLionsgate fright flick should finish with just under $50M making it thesecond-lowest-grossing film in the seven-part series ahead of just last year’sSaw VI.Rival horror sequel ParanormalActivity 2 suffered a big loss of its own declining by 56% in its thirdsession to an estimated $7.3M.

The comedy The Dilemma anchored by a different dynamic duo — Vince Vaughn and Kevin James — debuted in second place with not-so-impressive numbers. Awards contenders rounded out the top five with each posting solid results.Driving into the number one spot with an estimated $40M over the Friday-to-Monday holiday weekend was The Green Hornet starring Seth Rogen as the crime-fighting anti-hero with a supercharged sense of humor. The 3D action flick opened very wide in 3,584 theaters and averaged a commendable $11,161 per site over four days with 3D surcharges helping along the way. If estimates hold for the PG-13 pic, that would be the second best MLK debut ever trailing the $46.1M four-day tally of Cloverfield from 2008. Should the estimate prove to be too aggressive, it may fall to third behind the studio’s own Paul Blart: Mall Cop which bowed to $39.2M two years ago.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239899[/rtimage]Regardless of where it ends up ranking, Hornet successfully connected with its target audience of young males. According to studio research, 61% of the crowd was male. Appeal was broad across different age groups with 50% being under 25. Reviews were mixed and the CinemaScore grades were a good B+ overall and an encouraging A- for under 25 patrons.Hornet‘s opening was still below the numbers posted by other expensive super hero films released in the early part of the year. 2007’s Ghost Rider bowed to $52M over four days while 2003’s Daredevil debuted to $45M across four days as well. Both were February titles launched over Presidents Day weekend and had lower ticket prices and no 3D surcharges. However, they also came from the pages of Marvel comic books and had larger built-in audiences. Studios often use the first quarter of the year to launch super hero films that are not strong enough to compete with the big boys of summer.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239900[/rtimage]A whopping 69% of the weekend gross came from 3D screens which were offered in 2,704 playdates including 174 IMAX 3D sites. Outside of TRON: Legacy, there have been no major action movies for teens and young adults to be excited about over the past month so Hornet took advantage of an audience that was underserved. Super hero films usually burn out fast at the box office so Sony is trying to take in as much cash as it can upfront for the pricey movie which carries a production cost of at least $100M. With French director Michel Gondry at the helm and Asian star Jay Chou in the sidekick role, Hornet hopes to earn significant amounts around the world where action movies sell very well.Vince Vaughn and Kevin James saw a mediocre start to their new comedy The Dilemma which debuted in second with an estimated four-day take of $20.7M from 2,940 theaters for a moderate $7,041 average. The PG-13 film about a man who learns of his best friend’s wife’s infidelity also starred Winona Ryder, Jennifer Connelly, Channing Tatum, and Queen Latifah and was directed by Ron Howard who has been away from the comedy genre for over a decade. Over the Friday-to-Sunday period, Universal’s gross was estimated to be $17.4M. The debut was well below the opening weekend figures of Vaughn’s recent efforts like Four Christmases ($31.1M), Couples Retreat ($34.3M), and The Break-Up ($39.2M). It also did not come close to the $32.5M four-day gross of 2004’s Along Came Polly starring Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston which was another relationship comedy launching over MLK weekend.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239901[/rtimage]Budgeted at a hefty $70M with big paychecks for all the actors, The Dilemma played as expected to an adult crowd that skewed more towards women. Studio research showed that 60% of the audience was female and 58% was 30 and older. Reviews were bad and moviegoers felt mostly the same way as the CinemaScore grade was a disappointing B. Trailers and TV spots were unfunny leading many fans of the stars to skip this one. Vaughn has been able to sell tickets despite being slammed by critics before, but the magic didn’t work this time. Plus an abundance of critically-acclaimed awards contenders playing to adults provided plenty of stronger alternatives.The hit Western True Grit dropped from the top spot but still held up well slipping to an estimated $13.1M over four days boosting the total to $128.3M. Paramount’s acclaimed drama has now entered the Top 20 list of 2010’s highest-grossing releases and should have much more to collect in the weeks ahead.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239746[/rtimage]Colin Firth’s The King’s Speech finally expanded into wide national play with its expansion this weekend from 700 to 1,543 locations which resulted in an estimated $11.2M over the extended Friday-to-Monday span. Ranking fourth for the frame, the Weinstein Co. release averaged a solid $7,247 in its eighth frame and has banked $46.7M to date. The distributor patiently waited out the holidays and chose Golden Globes weekend to expand fully in hopes of capitalizing on awards buzz. Plus it will be a newer film in many markets when Oscar nominations are announced next week. Another expanding awards contender followed as Black Swan grossed an estimated $10.4M over four days with its $8.4M three-day score inching ahead of its Friday-to-Sunday gross from last weekend. Fox Searchlight widened the ballet thriller from 1,584 to 2,328 sites and has taken in an impressive $75.2M so far.Universal’s comedy threequel Little Fockers took in an estimated $8.4M in its fourth round for a $135.5M cume. Holding up well over the school holiday was Yogi Bear which grabbed an estimated $7.4M raising the sum for Warner Bros. to $84.2M. The kidpic has now grossed over five times its opening weekend take and may finish just below the $100M mark. The sci-fi reboot TRON: Legacy followed with an estimated $6.8M boosting the tally to $158.1M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239417[/rtimage]Dropping slightly was the acclaimed boxing drama The Fighter with an estimated $6.2M giving Paramount $66.8M thus far. Disney’s Tangled charmed up an estimated $5.5M and has taken in $182.5M to date. Nicolas Cage’s latest action offering Season of the Witch tumbled in its second weekend grossing an estimated $5.3M for a 11-day tally of just $18.8M. Luckily for Relativity, the production cost was just $40M. A final domestic gross of about $25M seems likely.The top ten films grossed an estimated $129.6M over four days which was down a sharp 29% from last year when Avatar stayed in the top spot with $54.4M; and down 30% from 2009 when Paul Blart: Mall Cop opened at number one with $39.2M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Star, Valentine's, Reality, york, Mindy, Worst, thriller, disaster, Film, ABC, latino, renewals","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Green-Hornet-Buzzes-To-The-Top"},{"id":"47509132324723","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Roommate Moves To The Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Roommate Moves To The TopSanctum and No Strings Attached round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | February 7, 2011 |  CommentsWith the Packers and Steelers squaring off in the Super Bowl, moviegoers avoided the multiplexes as the North American box office slumped to the third worst frame of the past two years. Of the two new releases that dared to compete against football, the collegiate thriller The Roommate fared well opening at number one by targeting young females but the older-skewing 3D action film Sanctum debuted poorly in second. The NFL championship game always commands the attention of the entire nation but this weekend’s Top 20 plunged to just $84.2M falling well below recent Super Bowl sessions from the past three years.Teenage girls and young women, the demographic least affected by football, turned out in solid numbers for the college-set thriller The Roommate which debuted at number one with an estimated $15.6M. The PG-13 film about a freshman gal with a creepy obsession with her new living partner averaged a good $6,156 from 2,534 theaters and marked Sony’s eighth film over the past eleven years to bow on top over Super Bowl weekend. Most were suspense thrillers from the studio’s Screen Gems unit like Roommate which play to this dependable audience.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240435[/rtimage]Produced for just $16M, The Roommate drew in its target audience with a relatable storyline and starpower from TV stars Leighton Meester (Gossip Girl) and Minka Kelly (Friday Night Lights). Studio research showed that 65% of the crowd was female and 61% was under 21. A targeted marketing campaign made sure that too much wasn’t spent on other demographic groups that would never come out anyway. Moviegoers polled by CinemaScore gave the pic a weak B- average grade.The underwater survival actioner Sanctum sank in its opening weekend grossing just $9.2M, according to estimates, despite playing very wide in 2,787 locations including over 2,000 3D screens and 178 IMAX venues. Averaging a weak $3,310, the R-rated film failed to spark much interest with ticket buyers despite being heavily promoted as a project from James Cameron who was one of the executive producers. In fact, Sanctum opened just below the $9.3M debut of the Oscar-winning director’s 1989 underwater adventure The Abyss which had significantly lower ticket prices, no 3D surcharges, and 1,200 fewer theaters.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240436[/rtimage]Universal and Relativity Media paid only $12M to acquire distribution rights (and paid for marketing) so the $30M-budgeted Sanctum should not turn into too problematic of a title financially. IMAX screens accounted for 17% of the gross, but overall moviegoers showed that paying a premium for this particular film was not worth it. The aquatic actioner suffered one of the worst openings for a live-action 3D film during the format’s current era and was about even with the two-day $6.3M bow of Gulliver’s Travels this past Christmas. According to studio research, females made up 53% of the audience and 65% was 30 and over so the film skewed much older than other titles. A poor C+ CinemaScore grade indicates a quick fade in the weeks to come. Reviews were mostly lackluster. Overseas, Sanctum debuted in second place in Australia with $1.6M and in fifth place in the U.K. with $1.5M.With only one new release generating good results and most holdovers fading away, the Top 20 suffered troubling declines compared to recent Super Bowl weekends – 23% vs. 2010, 29% vs 2009, and 30% vs. 2008. The aftermath of last week’s massive blizzard also played a role as people in many top markets in the Midwest and Northeast were still digging themselves out of the latest round of winter snow.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240049[/rtimage]The Natalie Portman-Ashton Kutcher romantic comedy No Strings Attached remained a popular item with audiences sliding only 37% in its third session to an estimated $8.4M. Paramount’s sex comedy has laughed up an impressive $51.8M in 17 days and is playing as effective counter-programming for women against all the football hoopla.Stepping closer to the $100M mark, Oscar front-runner The King’s Speech ranked fourth with an estimated $8.3M enjoying the smallest drop in the top ten with its 25% dip. The Weinstein Co. has reached $84.1M and will join the century club before the February 27 awards.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240050[/rtimage]The Green Hornet fell 46% to an estimated $6.1M placing fifth for the weekend giving Sony $87.2M to date for 2011’s top-grossing new release. Last week’s top performer The Rite suffered the worst drop of any film plunging 62% to an estimated $5.6M in its sophomore scare. Bad buzz and competition from a new fright flick contributed to the steep tumble. Warner Bros. has grossed $23.7M for its Anthony Hopkins supernatural thriller and should end up with $30-35M.Jason Statham’s latest action platform The Mechanic plunged 53% to an estimated $5.4M in its second weekend. The CBS Films release has grossed $20.1M in ten days and should end with about $30M. Jumping the $150M mark this past week was Oscar contender True Grit which took in an estimated $4.8M, down 37%, for a cume to date of $155M for Paramount. Along with TRON: Legacy, Jeff Bridges has raked in a stellar $324M this winter from his pair of blockbuster hits.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240052[/rtimage]Dropping 39% to ninth place was Vince Vaughn’s comedy The Dilemma with an estimated $3.4M bumping the total to $45.7M for Universal. Best Actress front-runner Natalie Portman rounded out the top ten with Fox Searchlight’s Black Swan which collected an estimated $3.4M, off 34%, for a $95.9M. Look for the ballerina thriller to cross the $100M mark by Valentine’s Day.The top ten films grossed an estimated $70.2M which was down 26% from last year when Dear John knocked Avatar out of the top spot with a $30.5M opening; and off 27% from 2009’s Super Bowl frame when Taken opened at number one with $24.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Writers, Horse, Box, child's, love, John, anime, Creative, Summer, Pop, media","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Roommate-Moves-To-The-Top"},{"id":"47509130457970","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Sandler Beats Bieber","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Sandler Beats BieberPlus, gnomes soar higher than eaglesby Gitesh Pandya | February 13, 2011 |  CommentsComedy king Adam Sandler and pop prince Justin Bieber fought over the North American box office crown with the funnyman winning a narrow victory according to studio estimates. Still, his comedy Just Go With It and the 3D concert flick Justin Bieber: Never Say Never each pulled in over $30M and were joined by the 3D animated film Gnomeo &amp; Juliet which exceeded expectations to power the marketplace to its best showing of 2011.Adam Sandler’s latest comedy Just Go With It didn’t soar to the heights of his summer offerings, but it delivered a sturdy debut nonetheless with an estimated $31M. Sony’s latest PG-13 vehicle from one of the industry’s most bankable stars averaged a sturdy $8,737 from a very wide 3,548 sites. Dennis Dugan directed his sixth Sandler vehicle and Jennifer Aniston co-starred in the story of a single doctor who must stretch a lie about being married with kids to extreme levels. As with most Sandman projects, critics piled on the insults.Just Go debuted well behind the $40.5M of the comedian’s last film Grown Ups but beat out the $22.7M of his previous offering, the R-rated Funny People. Non-summer debuts for Sandler in years past have been better like the $42.2M for Anger Management from April 2003 and the $39.9M for 50 First Dates from Valentine’s Day weekend in 2004. Just Go played to an older adult crowd with 60% of the audience being over 25 and 58% being female. The film’s budget was about $80M which on par with other comedies starring top A-list talent. It was the eleventh number one hit for Sandler who has been a consistent draw at the box office with $100M hits in 10 of the last 13 years.If estimates hold, teen pop sensation Justin Bieber will narrowly miss out on a number one opening with his 3D concert biopic Justin Bieber: Never Say Never which debuted impressively with an estimated $30.3M this weekend. Powered by his tween girl fan base, and their moms, the G-rated film averaged a stellar $9,746 from 3,105 theaters playing in 443 fewer locations than Sandler’s pic. A very high 84% of the gross came from 3D screens which included extra surcharges. Including $743,000 in sales from special Wednesday night previews held in selected cities, the total stands at $31M. Ticket packages for those shows were sold at $30 and included fan merchandise too so Paramount only counted a portion of that towards the box office gross.Budgeted at a mere $13M, Never Say Never tells the story of how a young Canadian kid turned himself into an internet sensation and then a multi-platinum superstar in just a couple of years. The audience was exactly as expected with females making up 84% of the crowd and 67% being under 25. Reviews were the best among the weekend’s four new releases and audiences liked what they got as the CinemaScore grade was a solid A. Despite the high score, sales are likely to decline fast as they generally do with movies that tap into intense fan demand. But with Valentine’s Day Monday expected to be a strong day and next weekend’s Presidents’ Day holiday frame, Never Say Never will certainly end up being a very profitable venture.Breaking down the days, Friday saw an easy Bieber victory with $12.4M compared to Just Go With It‘s $9.6M. The films swapped positions on Saturday with Sandler surging 41% to $13.5M and the teen singer dropping 13% to $10.8M. Sony is projecting a 41% decline on Sunday to $8M for Just while Paramount is estimating a 35% dip to $7M for Justin.Disney scored a solid debut for its 3D animated comedy Gnomeo &amp; Juliet which bowed to an estimated $25.5M by playing to families that have had very few good options this year. The G-rated pic about two feuding groups of garden gnomes set to the classic Shakespeare tale averaged a healthy $8,517 from 2,994 locations. Reviews were mixed but generally decent for what has become the biggest toon opening in February ever. With the Presidents’ Day holiday next week and many schools taking winter breaks this month, the road ahead seems bright and a run to the $100M mark cannot be ruled out.Opening to disappointing results in fourth was Channing Tatum’s historical epic The Eagle which grossed an estimated $8.6M from 2,296 theaters for a soft $3,741 average. The PG-13 film came nowhere near the $30.5M bow of the actor’s hit drama from last year Dear John and even fell below the $11M of his action film Fighting from April 2009. Reviews for Eagle were not too kind.Last weekend’s number one film The Roommate fell down to fifth place but fared well given all the competition dropping 44% to an estimated $8.4M. With $26M in ten days, Sony’s $16M-budgeted thriller should finish with $35-40M.Two weeks away from what The Weinstein Co. hopes will be the biggest night in the young company’s history, The King’s Speech remained popular with moviegoers dipping a mere 4% to an estimated $7.4M in its twelfth weekend. With ticket buyers continuing to catch up with what is the most likely film to win the Best Picture Oscar, the Colin Firth hit has raised its cume to $93.9M and should reach $100M before Presidents’ Day. It also swept the BAFTAs winning seven awards including Best Film.Natalie Portman’s golden touch helped her sex comedy No Strings Attached which slipped only 30% to an estimated $5.6M giving Paramount $59.9M to date. Universal’s 3D underwater adventure Sanctum tumbled 46% to an estimated $5.1M in its second weekend. With just $17.5M in ten days, the James Cameron pet project should finish with a disappointing $27-30M putting it at around half of the $54.2M of 1989’s The Abyss.The blockbuster Western True Grit grossed an estimated $3.8M, down 19%, putting Paramount’s sum at $160.3M. Sony’s super hero flick The Green Hornet followed falling 40% to an estimated $3.6M and $92.3M overall. With $107.2M overseas, the Seth Rogen film will jump the $200M global mark on Monday.In limited release, the indie comedy Cedar Rapids debuted to an estimated $311,000 from just 15 theaters for a solid $20,733 average for Fox Searchlight.The top ten films grossed an estimated $129.3M which was down 29% from last year when Valentine’s Day opened in the top spot with $56.3M; and down 15% from 2009 when Friday the 13th debuted at number one with $40.6M. However, both of those frames were during the lucrative Presidents’ Day holiday session.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!twitter.com/giteshpandya","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Rom-Com, 71st, Calendar","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Sandler-Beats-Bieber"},{"id":"47509132333941","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: No Strings Attached Wins Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: No Strings Attached Wins WeekendPlus, The Way Back fails to crack the top ten.by Gitesh Pandya | January 24, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, Hollywood’s current princess Natalie Portman reigned supreme over the North American box office as her new comedy No Strings Attached debuted at number one giving the Black Swan actress two films in the top ten a week after her big Golden Globe win. With no other films opening in wide release, most holdovers fared well with awards contenders enjoying the best legs thanks to strong word-of-mouth and buzz. But overall, the marketplace remained in poor shape falling below last year’s levels for the eleventh consecutive weekend.Audiences came out in healthy numbers for the sex comedy No Strings Attached spending an estimated $20.3M on its opening weekend. The R-rated film starring Portman and Ashton Kutcher about a couple that tries to have a sex-only relationship played heavily to young adult women. The debut was slightly better than the openings for R-rated non-summer comedies like I Love You, Man ($17.8M) and Forgetting Sarah Marshall ($17.7M) and matched the $20.2M bow of Kutcher’s PG-13 summer comedy What Happens in Vegas co-starring Cameron Diaz. That film went on to reach $80.3M. Portman has only opened one other film at number one while in the lead role – V For Vendetta which bowed to $25.6M in March 2006.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240049[/rtimage]According to studio research, women made up a whopping 70% of the audience while 60% were over 25. Critics gave mixed reviews and audiences felt the same as Strings scored a not-so-impressive B CinemaScore grade. Starpower and a lack of exciting films aimed at young women right now helped the top spot performance. Produced for just $25M, the Paramount release may come close to tripling that amount in its final domestic tally. Female-skewing comedies are often programmed into January as an alternative option for older teen girls and young women during a time when the football playoffs are taking lots of men out of the picture. Sunday’s games are expected to have a big impact on the multiplexes, especially in the Northeast and Midwest where the four Super Bowl-hopeful teams are from.Last week’s top film The Green Hornet fell to second and experienced a decent hold for the superhero genre falling 46% to an estimated $18.1M. Sony has collected $63.4M in ten days for its Seth Rogen action comedy and may find its way to just over the $100M mark domestically. Overseas, the 3D pic grossed an estimated $18.7M thanks to some new countries opening upping the international take to $37.4M and the global gross to $100.8M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240050[/rtimage]Universal suffered a larger-than-hoped-for drop for its Vince Vaughn-Kevin James buddy comedy The Dilemma which fell 45% to an estimated $9.7M for a ten-day total of $33.4M. Upon opening last weekend to a soft $17.8M, the studio was comparing the Ron Howard-directed film to adult comedies like Something’s Gotta Give and As Good As It Gets which had sophomore declines of 29% and 3% respectively. Budgeted at $70M, The Dilemma may end its run with about $60M.Awards contenders all hoping for Best Picture nominations on Tuesday from the Academy followed with each showing sturdy legs. The King’s Speech, which surprised the industry Saturday by upsetting The Social Network for the prestigious PGA prize, grossed an estimated $9.2M matching its performance from last weekend. With no decline and another frame in the number four slot, the Colin Firth-Geoffrey Rush period drama pushed its cume up to $58.6M and is now on track to jump the $100M mark if it can land the wide range of Oscar nods it’s expected to get.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240051[/rtimage]The Weinstein Co. projected an aggressive estimate projecting a slim 20% Saturday-to-Sunday drop when other adult dramas were forecasting 40-50%. Speech is hoping to be a strong upscale alternative to football on Sunday but even a final take of under $9M would keep it in fourth place. The royal drama is following a strategy similar to Million Dollar Baby by waiting until later in the race to expand nationally and become a bigger part of the Oscar conversation thus making it a fresher film to vote for over an overexposed front-runner. The King’s Speech wants to do to The Social Network what the Clint Eastwood pic did to The Aviator six years ago.Western powerhouse True Grit placed fifth with an estimated $8M, off only 27%, upping Paramount’s take to $138.6M. Natalie Portman popped up again with her second film in the top ten with the red hot Black Swan which took in an estimated $6.2M in its eighth round. Off just 26%, the Fox Searchlight film has banked $83.6M thus far. Paramount’s brother tale The Fighter, which won both supporting acting Golden Globes last weekend, dipped a mere 12% to an estimated $4.5M and has punched up a solid $73M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240052[/rtimage]The King’s Speech and Black Swan are both on course to join True Grit in the $100M+ club and Fighter could break in too proving that quality adult dramas can sell tons of tickets, especially during awards season. The quartet of acclaimed films has already grossed a combined $354M and will probably reach $475M or more. The combined production costs for the four hits is under $100M. Best Picture nominations will open the doors to more moviegoers curious to see the year’s best films so expect these titles to stick around for a while. And with very few exciting new releases scheduled between now and Oscar night, there is plenty of mileage left.Christmas leftovers rounded out the top ten. Universal’s comedy Little Fockers fell 39% to an estimated $4.4M raising the cume to $141.2M. Despite today’s higher ticket prices, the third pic in the series will end as the lowest-grossing installment finishing below the $166.2M of 2000’s Meet the Parents and well below the $279.2M of 2004’s Meet the Fockers.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240053[/rtimage]Warner Bros. enjoyed another good hold from Yogi Bear which grossed an estimated $4.1M, off 24%, for a $88.9M total. A lack of competing kidpics is helping the 3D pic head towards $100M. TRON: Legacy did well too slipping 35% to an estimated $3.7M for an impressive $163.3M to date.The top ten films grossed an estimated $88.2M which was down a troubling 27% from last year when Avatar stayed in the top spot with $34.9M; and down 26% from 2009 when Paul Blart: Mall Cop remained at number one with $21.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Crunchyroll, tv, CW, TV, thirty, WGN, movie, game, killer, Nat, renewed, SXSW, Christmas, 20th","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-No-Strings-Attached-Wins-Weekend"},{"id":"47509134073741","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences show love for Despicable Me","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences show love for Despicable MePlus, Twilight holds on at #2, and Predators knocks Toy Story down to fourth.by Gitesh Pandya | July 12, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, moviegoers flooded the multiplexes spending plenty of cash on a variety of movies led by the better-than-expected opening for the 3D animated comedy Despicable Me which easily took control of the number one spot. The sci-fi action pic Predators also debuted well taking third place while most holdovers showed considerable strength suffering only small declines. The top ten surged to its second best showing of the year with a powerful $191M in ticket sales.Steve Carell’s evil plan for world domination worked as his new toon Despicable Me hauled in an estimated $60.1M this weekend from 3,476 theaters for a muscular $17,295 average. For struggling Universal, it was the best opening for the studio in the 15 months since Fast and Furious bowed to $71M in April 2009. Expected to debut in the $30-40M range, the PG-rated pic took advantage of great reviews plus highly effective trailers and TV spots that made the film appeal to both families as well as teens and young adults. Parents with kids under 12 made up only 55% of the crowd while the CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A. The performance was especially impressive considering the fact that Toy Story 3 and The Last Airbender are pulling in kids and together grossed nearly $40M this weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1214097&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=34&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Despicable Me outgunned the openings of other non-sequel 3D toons like How to Train Your Dragon and Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs which bowed to $43.7M and $30.3M, respectively. Both were embraced by critics and audiences alike and went on to gross four to five times their opening weekend grosses. With Despicable‘s summer play period, its domestic gross could easily go on to triple the $69M production budget in North America alone and add much more from overseas markets plus worldwide home video.Following an explosive opening week that saw a staggering $187M in seven days, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse fell to second place in its sophomore weekend collecting an estimated $33.4M propelling the 12-day haul to a massive $237M. The third Cullen pic dropped only 49%. The decline was not too high since the Friday-to-Sunday period last week did not include the opening day turnout. But Summit should be very happy with the hold as it was much lower than the sophomore falls for the last two highly anticipated Harry Potter films which also launched on summer Wednesdays. 2007’s Order of the Phoenix dropped 58% and last year’s Half-Blood Prince fell 62%.[rtimage]MapID=1210749&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Overseas, Eclipse banked an additional $81.1M from 63 markets and boosted the overseas cume to $219M and the global haul to $456M. In North America, the latest Bella tale should be able to beat New Moon‘s $296.6M and finish in the neighborhood of $310M.Fox’s sci-fi reboot Predators landed in third place opening to an estimated $25.3M from 2,669 theaters for a sturdy $9,479 average per location. The R-rated action film was produced by Robert Rodriguez and starred Adrien Brody and Laurence Fishburne. Budgeted at just under $40M, the ultraviolent pic took advantage of a marketplace dominated by movies for women and kids leaving a big opportunity that a franchise-based testosterone flick could take advantage of. The weekend was heavily frontloaded with Friday accounting for 41% of the three-day gross and Saturday falling 19% from the opening day. Reviews were quite good for this genre.[rtimage]MapID=1229154&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=11&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Despite another 3D toon stealing away potential business, Toy Story 3 held up very well in its fourth frame grossing an estimated $22M slipping only 27%. The Woody threequel upped its total gross to a stellar $340.2M after only 24 days making it the highest-grossing film ever for Pixar edging past the $339.7M of 2003’s Finding Nemo. The fish flick has sold about 40% more tickets, though, as prices were lower seven years ago and there were no 3D surcharges added in to its tally. Toy Story 3 rose up to number 17 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters behind the $340.7M lifetime take of 2002’s The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.Paramount’s The Last Airbender suffered the worst drop in the top ten tumbling 58% to an estimated $17.2M in its second weekend. The M. Night Shyamalan-directed sci-fi actioner raised its 11-day total to a solid $100.2M making it the director’s first film to break the century mark since 2004’s The Village. Airbender could conclude its domestic run in the vicinity of $140M.[rtimage]MapID=1213190&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=45&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Adam Sandler crossed the $100M mark for the eleventh time in his career over the weekend as his latest comedy Grown Ups enjoyed a sensational hold slipping only 14% to an estimated $16.4M boosting the 17-day tally to $111.3M for Sony. Despite the usual dreadful reviews, audiences are continuing to turn out for this dose of mindless summer laughs. Tom Cruise won’t be joining the century club with his action-comedy Knight and Day which slipped 25% to an estimated $7.9M for $61.9M to date for Fox.80s pals The Karate Kid and The A-Team have spent all five of their weeks next to each other on the charts. Sony’s Kid fell 29% to an estimated $5.7M while Fox’s Team dropped 44% to an estimated $1.8M. Totals thus far are $164.6M and $74M, respectively.Holding onto tenth place was the indie hit comedy Cyrus which expanded from 77 to 200 locations and watched its weekend gross climb 78% to an estimated $1.4M. The Fox Searchlight release averaged a solid $6,875 and has banked $3.5M to date with many more cities to open in the coming weeks.[rtimage]MapID=1223778&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]There was plenty of good news to go around for other independent films in limited release too. Focus enjoyed sensational results for its Sundance acquisition The Kids Are All Right which platformed in only seven locations but grossed an estimated $505,000 for a scorching $72,143 per theater. Winning praise from critics, the R-rated film about teen children of a lesbian couple wanting to meet their biological father was picked up for nearly $5M after wowing the film industry in Park City in January.Also performing very well was the Swedish thriller The Girl Who Played With Fire which opened at number eleven nationwide with an estimated $965,000 from only 110 locations for a strong $8,773 average. Fire is the sequel to March’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo which has grossed $9.3M to date. Other notable indie holdovers include Roadside Attractions’ Winter’s Bone with an estimated $507,000 and $4,783 average in its fifth weekend with $2.6M to date, and Anchor Bay’s Solitary Man with an estimated $457,000 and $3.5M cume.[rtimage]MapID=10012413&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $191.1M which was up 45% from last year when Brüno opened in the top spot with $30.6M; and up 37% from 2008 when Hellboy II debuted at number one with $34.5M.

Grossing more than the next six films combined, theR-rated action pic from Sony’s Screen Gems unit debuted to an estimated $27.7Mhelped, of course, by 3D surcharges. The fourth in the successful line ofMilla Jovovichfilms averaged a muscular $8,648 from 3,203 theaters outgunning the $23.7M ofthe last film in the series, 2007’s ResidentEvil: Extinction, which was the previous franchise high. Admissionsremained mostly the same with just over three million tickets sold.Shot in 3D and offering a popular brand and formula, Afterlifeattracted fans that have enjoyed the film series and video game over theyears. According to studio research, 58% of the crowd was male while those overand under 25 were about even. Over 2,000 of the playdates offered 3D screensincluding 141 digital IMAX venues charging as much as $18 per ticket. Facingzero competition thanks to a mix of no new wide releases and aging holdoversmade the newest Alice flick the only game in town.

Add in the fact that American‘sWednesday launch meant its opening weekend gross did not include the opening daytally and the fact that no new films targeting its mature adult audience openedthis weekend and the 55% fall becomes quite troubling.

Among new releases, the Steve Carell-Paul Rudd comedy Dinner for Schmucks delivered a good opening in the runnerup spot while the 3D family film Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore and the teen melodrama Charlie St. Cloud both disappointed in their debuts.Christopher Nolan’s mind games on moviegoers continued with Inception pulling in an estimated $27.5M in its third weekend to rule the box office once again. The Warner Bros. sensation dropped only 36% and boosted its 17-day total to a stellar $193.3M with the $200M barrier set to fall on Tuesday in its 19th day of release. The average was a solid $7,763 from 3,545 sites with 247 theaters being shed. It was only the third new release of the year to threepeat following Alice in Wonderland and Shrek Forever After, and the first 2D film to do so since 2008’s Tropic Thunder which followed the four-week reign of Nolan’s last film The Dark Knight.[rtimage]MapID=1217219&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Inception has become the second biggest hit ever for DiCaprio after just Titanic and has surpassed Clash of the Titans to become the studio’s top-grossing film of the year. Warners can sure use it since its other summer bets Sex and the City 2, Splice, and Jonah Hex have all been underperformers. With good legs, Inception still has a chance at reaching $300M from North America alone. Overseas, the mind-bending thriller grossed an estimated $53.7M from 51 markets lifting the international tally to $170M and the worldwide gross to a huge $363M.Paramount’s star-driven comedy Dinner for Schmucks opened in second place with a respectable bow of $23.3M, according to estimates. The Steve Carell-Paul Rudd pic averaged $8,004 from 2,911 locations and came in close to Carell’s last live-action hit Date Night which debuted to $25.2M and a $7,471 average in April. With its more accessible PG-13, Schmucks also opened better than Rudd’s recent R-rated ventures like I Love You, Man ($17.8M) and Role Models ($19.2M).[rtimage]MapID=1223752&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Summer has been surprisingly light on star-driven broad comedies with many of the laughs coming from cartoons or action titles instead. At this point last summer, The Hangover and The Proposal had grossed a combined $405M. Dinner came in and played to an underserved audience. Produced for about $60M, Schmucks played to a crowd that was 55% male and 54% over 25. The CinemaScore grade was just a B and this Friday’s arrival of the Will Ferrell comedy The Other Guys will provide direct competition so the road ahead will not be an easy one.Angelina Jolie enjoyed a solid second weekend for her spy thriller Salt which dropped 47%, reasonably low for a summer action movie, to an estimated $19.3M in third place. Sony has banked $70.8M in ten days and looks headed for the vicinity of $120M coming close to the $134.5M of her 2008 stylish effects-heavy action title Wanted. Overseas, Salt’s roll out continued this weekend with top spot bows in South Korea, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Ukraine, and the Philippines. The international take over the frame was $24.5M upping the cume to $32.8M for a global gross of $103.6M to date with much more to come. With a production cost north of $100M, the stunts-heavy pic could be heading for a worldwide tally of $300M or more.[rtimage]MapID=1213717&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Despicable Me spent its fourth weekend in the top five collecting an estimated $15.5M for another slim decline of 34%. Universal has taken in an impressive $190.3M in just 24 days and is less than a week away from scoring its first double-century smash in three years. The studio’s spy sequel The Bourne Ultimatum scored a $227.5M gross in the summer of 2007 and it’s been a rough ride since for the distributor.Proving that parents can’t be fooled into seeing just any 3D kids movie, Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore opened poorly in fifth place with an estimated $12.5M from a very wide 3,705 theaters for a weak $3,381 average despite the added surcharges collected for the format. The followup to the 2001 hit which grossed $93.4M generated little interest and with the target audience of families already having paid large sums of cash for this year’s numerous other 3D kidpics, Kitty Galore just didn’t warrant the extra expenditure. The opening was on par with the $11.6M of June’s Marmaduke, another franchise pet movie that nobody asked for.Debuting outside the top five was Zac Efron’s starring vehicle Charlie St. Cloud which bowed to an estimated $12.1M from 2,718 sites for a mediocre $4,465 average. The PG-13 film was extremely front-loaded drawing the bulk of its young female audience on opening day with $5.5M on Friday. Saturday tumbled a disturbing 32% to $3.8M and Sunday is projected by Universal to dip by 30% to $2.7M. Produced for $44M, pricey for this type of drama, Charlie drew an audience that was 79% female and 59% under 25. Reviews were terrible.[rtimage]MapID=1196045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=36&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney and Pixar dropped to seventh with Toy Story 3 which grossed an estimated $5M in its seventh session, off 44%, for a $389.7M total. Adam Sandler broke the $150M mark for the fourth time in his career with the leggy comedy hit Grown Ups. The Sony release fell 39% to an estimated $4.5M lifting the cume to $150.7M. The comedian’s only bigger grossers were 1999’s Big Daddy ($163.5M), 1998’s The Waterboy ($161.5M), and 2005’s The Longest Yard ($158.1M).Nicolas Cage’s The Sorcerer’s Apprentice suffered the worst decline in the top ten tumbling 55% to an estimated $4.3M for a weak $51.9M sum for Disney. The Twilight Saga: Eclipse rounded out the top ten with an estimated $4M, down 45%, and $288.2M to date.In the limited release world, the César Award-winning French film The Concert enjoyed a good platform debut grossing an estimated $20,121 from a pair of theaters for a solid $10,061 average for The Weinstein Company. Focus expanded its indie hit comedy The Kids Are All Right nationwide to 847 locations and grossed an estimated $3.5M for a decent $4,090 average. Total stands at $9.6M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $128.1M which was up 20% from last year when Funny People opened in the top spot with $22.7M; but down 9% from 2008 when The Dark Knight remained at number one for a third consecutive weekend with $42.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Horse, TLC, indiana, Now, visit, Christmas, cancelled, Disney","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Inception-Beats-Schmucks-for-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509134070667","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Inception Retains the Top Spot","content":"\n\n                                            Weekend Box Office\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Box Office Guru Wrapup: Inception Retains the Top Spot\n                        Plus, Salt performs well, while Ramona and Beezus debuts at #6\n                        by Gitesh Pandya | July 26, 2010                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis weekend, Warner Bros. enjoyed a sensational second weekend for its sci-fi thriller Inception which capitalized on amazing buzz to remain the most popular film in North America. Angelina Jolie’s new action pic Salt had to settle for second place but the spy thriller still generated a healthy opening. Like last weekend, funny films had the best holds while everything else dropped harder.\n\n\nDeclining by a slim 31%, Inception topped the charts once again with an estimated $43.5M rocketing its ten-day tally to a stellar $143.7M. It was the second lowest drop witnessed all year for a wide release in its sophomore frame and put the Leonardo DiCaprio hit on track to break the $250M mark and possibly the $300M barrier as well. Playing in 3,792 theaters, including 197 IMAX sites, the mind-bending film averaged a muscular $11,473 which was tops among all wide releases.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1217219&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nInception has an incredible road ahead of it. Word-of-mouth is amazing, repeat business is solid, competition over the coming weeks is not too fierce, and midweek sales have been enormous. It may even extend its streak to three weeks at number one. The hold was especially impressive given the arrival of another star-driven action thriller in Salt.\n\n\nThat Angelina Jolie starrer debuted well in the runner-up spot with an estimated $36.5M from 3,612 locations for a meaty $10,105 average. The Sony espionage thriller about a CIA agent on the run when suspected of being a Russian secret agent played to an adult audience and had cross-gender appeal. Studio research showed that 53% of the crowd was female and 59% was over 25. Reviews were mixed and moviegoers responded to the starpower of the lead and the promise of action and stunts. Unlike Inception, Salt featured very few special effects.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1213717&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nThe media gave extensive coverage to the fact that Tom Cruise passed on doing the film and opted for another spy flick, Knight and Day, instead. But paying customers were more excited by Jolie as Salt grossed more in its first 3 days than Knight did in its first 9 days. Cruise’s latest project is set to end its domestic run with less than $80M while Salt stands a great chance of breaking $100M.\n\n\nAudience favorite Despicable Me held up remarkably well in its third frame sliding only 27% to an estimated $24.1M boosting the 17-day total to a stunning $161.7M. Universal’s highest-grossing film in three years, the 3D toon is well on its way to reaching at least $225M and could go even higher as competition in the coming weeks is not too strong for its target audience.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1214097&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=34&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nDisney’s big-budget misfire The Sorcerer’s Apprentice fell to fourth place with an estimated $9.7M failing to break double-digit millions in its second weekend in theaters. With only $42.6M in 12 days, the effects-driven Nicolas Cage action title looks to reach $70-80M which would be only half of its production cost.\n\n\nGiving the Mouse House better news was Toy Story 3 which still had good legs dipping only 25% to an estimated $9M in its sixth round. The 3D toon has banked $379.5M rising to number 12 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters behind the $380.3M of 2005’s Star Wars Episode III. The $400M barrier will come crashing down in August.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1196045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=36&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nFox bowed its new girl pic Ramona and Beezus in sixth place with a quiet $8M, according to estimates. The G-rated film based on the popular children’s books by author Beverly Cleary averaged a mild $2,942 from 2,719 theaters and played mostly to young girls and their moms. The low cost $15M production attracted an audience that was 69% family and 75% female.

Funny holdovers held up well while most others fell sharply as the overall marketplace remained strong.Following much anticipation, Warner Bros. unleashed its Leonardo DiCaprio-led crime thriller Inception and was met with a strong response from ticket buyers taking in an estimated $60.4M in its opening weekend. The studio released the Christopher Nolan-directed pic in 3,792 theaters including a record 197 IMAX sites and averaged a sizzling $15,928 per location. It was the actor’s biggest opening ever beating out the $41.1M of Shutter Island from just five months ago. Inception also delivered the third biggest opening of the year for a 2D film following the high-profile summer sequels Iron Man 2 and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.[rtimage]MapID=1217219&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=25&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fans had been waiting for Nolan to follow up on his 2008 megahit The Dark Knight and Inception provided a thinking person’s pic thanks to an original story written by the director. Films with openings like this are usually based on some kind of pre-existing source material or are headlined by stars that routinely open pictures at this level. Reviews and word-of-mouth so far have been very strong and the complex storyline does encourage repeat viewing so the road ahead could be promising. The PG-13 pic cost $150M to produce.Overseas, Inception premiered in Nolan’s native U.K. plus a half-dozen Asian territories to a solid estimate of $15.6M and rolls out into 29 more markets this coming weekend including Japan, France, Mexico, Australia, Korea, and Russia. Thirteen more countries including Germany open on the following frame.[rtimage]MapID=1214097&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=34&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Knocked down to number two but still packing quite a punch was the 3D toon Despicable Me which grossed an estimated $32.7M in its second weekend. The Universal hit fell just 42% which represented a terrific hold considering all the summer competition. Steve Carell’s turn as a lovable supervillain has pulled in a stellar $118.4M in its first ten days and with strong midweeks could very well be headed past the $200M mark. The struggling studio has had only two other films join the double-century club over the last five years — King Kong and The Bourne Ultimatum — and is now well-positioned as one of the last major studio players in the lucrative animation world.Superproducer Jerry Bruckheimer suffered one of the worst openings of his career with the weak launch of the big-budget adventure film The Sorcerer’s Apprentice which bowed to just $17.4M in third place, according to estimates. With $24.5M in the five days since its Wednesday start, the PG-rated pic managed to average $4,958 from 3,504 theaters. Apprentice stars Nicolas Cage as a wizard that takes on a protégé to help him in his long battle with a rival wizard.[rtimage]MapID=1212688&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The performance was about even with the producer’s 2004 summer adventure King Arthur which also bowed midweek in July in third place and opened to $15.2M over the weekend ($4,923 average) and $23.6M in five days. That film, still ranking as one of Bruckheimer’s biggest failures, sold about 13% more tickets in its five-day debut and ended its domestic run at just $51.9M.Reportedly costing around $150M to produce, the flop follows Bruckheimer’s other pricey summer action offering Prince of Persia which has been a disappointment in North America grossing less than $90M to date despite a budget that was much higher. The veteran producer has long been a steady supplier of hits for Disney but this summer marks a rare case of back-to-back clunkers from his signature genre of loud and expensive summer action movies. Apprentice offered impressive special effects, but its generic feel prevented audience members from getting any excitement.[rtimage]MapID=1210749&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Summit’s teen smash The Twilight Saga: Eclipse cracked the Top 50 chart of all-time domestic blockbusters this weekend. The vampire pic dropped 57% to an estimated $13.5M bumping the total to an impressive $264.9M putting the third installment of the franchise at number 48 behind Shrek which grossed $267.7M in 2001. Toy Story 3 rose up to number 15 on the all-time list this weekend with its estimated $11.7M three-day take. Off 44%, the Disney/Pixar smash has hauled in $362.7M to date and now sits behind The Passion of the Christ‘s $370.3M.Sony’s Grown Ups still played well as the summer’s big broad comedy grossing an estimated $10M in its fourth frame, down 37%, boosting the cume for the Adam Sandler pic to $129.3M. Fantasy flick The Last Airbender fell 55% in its third weekend to an estimated $7.5M giving Paramount $114.8M in 18 days.[rtimage]MapID=1229154&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=11&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Producer Robert Rodriguez’s Predators collapsed in its sophomore frame tumbling 73% to an estimated $6.8M and lifted its ten-day total to a decent $40.1M. Fox stablemate Knight and Day took in an estimated $3.7M, off 52%, for a $69.2M cume. Sony’s reboot hit Karate Kid dropped 59% to an estimated $2.2M and has taken in a terrific $169.2M to date.The top ten films grossed an estimated $165.9M which was up 10% from last year when Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opened in the top spot with $77.8M; but down 34% from 2008 when The Dark Knight debuted at number one with a record $158.4M. This is the third year in a row that Warner Bros. opened a new film at number one on this particular frame.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"hollywood, cinemax, Calendar, Horror, jamie, Central, psychological, criterion, godzilla, scene, TV, Country, spinoff","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Inception-Soars-to-No-1"},{"id":"47509134057347","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Wall Street Is In The Money","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Wall Street Is In The MoneyLegend of the Guardians and The Town round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | September 27, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, Michael Douglas and director Oliver Stone reteamed for the financial crisis drama Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps and scored the best openings of their careers with an estimated $19M topping a sluggish box office that saw the top ten fail to break $90M for the fifth consecutive weekend. The PG-13 film marking the return of corporate raider Gordon Gekko (a role that won Douglas the Best Actor Oscar) averaged a decent $5,330 from 3,565 theaters for Fox. Stone’s previous best opening was $18.7M for World Trade Center which bowed on a Wednesday in August 2006 while Douglas beat his previous high (in a lead role) of $17.1M for the kidnapping thriller Don’t Say A Word which bowed this very weekend in 2001 when it led a box office resurgence just weeks after the 9/11 attacks.Co-starring Shia LaBeouf, Carey Mulligan, and Josh Brolin, the Wall Street sequel was met with mixed reviews from film critics who didn’t love it as much as the first one which opened in December 1987, just two months after the stock markets crashed. The new Gekko pic marked Fox’s first number one opener of 2010, something the studio was waiting some time for. It did, however, top the first five weekends of the year with 2009’s Avatar. Wall Street played to an older crowd with 65% of the audience being over 30 while males and females were evenly split. Formidable competition for review-reading adults came from last week’s acclaimed champ The Town which held up quite well in its sophomore frame.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237401[/rtimage]Warner Bros. landed in second place with the opening of its 3D adventure film Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole which bowed to an estimated $16.3M from a very wide 3,575 theaters. The PG-rated kidpic based on the popular book series averaged $4,569 per location which was not too strong considering the higher ticket prices at the more than 2,400 3D locations including 193 IMAX 3D sites. Reviews were mixed and starpower from the voices of Geoffrey Rush, Helen Mirren, and Sam Neill did little to excite families. Plus, how many owl movies soar at the box office?The book series did not come with as large of a built-in fan base as other literary properties have had when making the move to the multiplexes. The Ga’Hoole launch amounted to about half of the bows from last fall’s book-turned-kidpics Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Where the Wild Things Are which opened to $30.3M and $32.7M, respectively.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237261[/rtimage]Strong word-of-mouth is helping Ben Affleck’s bank robbery thriller The Town become that elusive type of film that all studios want — the durable box office winner with legs. The Warner Bros. hit suffered the smallest decline among all wide releases dipping only 33% to an estimated $16M in its second weekend for a solid ten-day score of $49.1M. That puts the Boston-set drama not far behind the pace of the studio’s Martin Scorsese winner The Departed which dropped 29% in its sophomore outing with a $57M take in ten days. Town lags by just 14% in terms of gross sales. The critically acclaimed film also scored the weekend’s best per-theater average among wide releases with $5,556 in its sophomore session edging out Wall Street and others. Affleck and company should easily be able to make off with $90M in the end and may even reach nine-digit territory.The high school comedy Easy A followed in fourth with an estimated $10.7M dropping a respectable 40% in its sophomore frame. With $32.8M in ten days, the Sony release could be headed for $55-60M.Opening one spot below was another female-driven comedy that mines high school for laughs — You Again. The PG-rated pic starring Kristen Bell, Jamie Lee Curtis, Sigourney Weaver, and Betty White debuted with an estimated $8.3M from 2,548 locations for a mild $3,257 average. Despite the starpower, the Buena Vista release was affected by direct competition from Easy A which still pulled in a sizable number of young women. Even the male-driven dramas Wall Street and The Town have been seeing about half of their business come from females. Critics gave You Again unfavorable marks.The M. Night Shyamalan production Devil fell 47% in its second weekend — not too bad for a horror film — and grossed an estimated $6.5M. After ten days, the Universal release has collected $21.7M and should finish with $32-35M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237263[/rtimage]Falling 51% in its third weekend was Sony’s 3D zombie sequel Resident Evil: Afterlife with an estimated $4.9M for the frame and $52M total. International markets brought in an additional $24M boosting the overseas cume to an impressive $150.7M for a stellar global tally of $202.7M and counting. Afterlife is now the top-grossing Resident Evil pic both domestically and worldwide, thanks to higher 3D ticket prices and continued fan interest in the franchise.Proving that not all 3D films are big sellers, the animated pic Alpha and Omega dropped 48% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $4.7M for a ten-day take of only $15.1M. The Lionsgate release looks to end with around $24M. Sony’s hit heist film Takers followed with an estimated $1.7M, off 46%, for a $54.9M total.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237403[/rtimage]Christopher Nolan’s Inception became the only 2010 release to spend eleven weekends in the top ten thanks to its estimated $1.2M frame. The long-running Warner Bros. smash eased by only 37% and raised its sum to $287.1M from North America.In limited release, the documentary Waiting for Superman which examines the pitfalls of the American educational system earned a terrific grade in its platform debut with an estimated $141,000 from just four locations for a scorching $35,250 average. Winning the Documentary Audience Award at Sundance earlier this year, the PG-rated film from the director of An Inconvenient Truth bowed in only New York and Los Angeles this weekend and expands to the top ten markets on Friday. Reviews have been overwhelmingly positive and Paramount used an aggressive online pledge campaign to boost interest and engage moviegoers in the release.Lionsgate saw a solid debut for its horror entry Buried starring Ryan Reynolds which scared up an estimated $104,500 from just 11 locations for a $9,500 average. The R-rated chiller opens wider on October 8 against Wes Craven’s 3D fright flick My Soul to Take splitting the Halloween month’s horror crowd that weekend.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237402[/rtimage]The Will Ferrell-produced sex comedy The Virginity Hit failed to score with audiences opening to a pathetic $300,000, according to estimates. Sony’s no-budget pic averaged a puny $429 from an unusually wide release in 700 theaters and showed no signs of being a breakout hit deserving so many playdates.The top ten films grossed an estimated $89.3M which was up 13% from last year when Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs stayed in the top spot with $25M; and up 9% from 2008 when Eagle Eye debuted at number one with $29.2M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"nfl, NBC, Wars, Movies, Turner, telelvision, television, dramedy, twilight, review","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Wall-Street-Is-In-The-Money"},{"id":"47509135698842","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Date Night Battles Titans for Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Date Night Battles Titans for Top SpotAlso, How To Train Your Dragon shows staying power.by Gitesh Pandya | April 12, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, in a virtual dead heat for first place, Fox’s new comedy Date Night opened with about as much in ticket sales as the second session of the Warner Bros. 3D epic Clash of the Titans. Sunday estimates from the studios had the films separated by only $225,000 which is not enough to claim a decisive victory, but both films certainly pulled in solid amounts powering the overall marketplace to another very strong spring frame. Final grosses to be reported on Monday, after Sunday sales are counted, will determine the official rankings.[rtimage]MapID=1226635&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The new Steve Carell-Tina Fey film Date Night attracted an impressive turnout grossing an estimated $27.1M in its first weekend of release. Debuting in 3,374 locations, the PG-13 film about a married couple’s disastrous evening out averaged a very impressive $8,032 per theater. Reviews were mixed but generally upbeat as audiences instead responded to the starpower of the two leads who have enjoyed much success in television and at the movies. In fact, this is Fey’s third number one hit comedy in April following 2004’s Mean Girls which she wrote and co-starred in as well as 2008’s Baby Mama. Produced for $55M, Date played as mainstream entertainment for adult audiences. Fox estimated a 34% Saturday-to-Sunday drop nearly matching the 35% decline Warner Bros. estimated for its Titans. If the rankings stay the same after final numbers are reported, Date Night will be the first 2D movie to take the top spot in six weeks.[rtimage]MapID=1212698&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=49&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]As expected, the 3D mythology remake Clash of the Titans fell sharply in its second weekend falling 56% to an estimated $26.9M. If estimates hold, it will finish the frame close behind in second place with a cume of $110.5M after 10.5 days. Titans was number one on Saturday and is estimated to be tops on Sunday too, but Date Night‘s stronger Friday on its opening day gives it the advantage over the three-day period. Warner Bros. could end up with roughly $160M by the end of Clash‘s run.The big story this weekend came in third place where the 3D animated film How To Train Your Dragon witnessed a remarkably low 13% decline in its third round for an estimated $25.4M gross boosting the 17-day total to a terrific $133.9M. Short-sighted film industry watchers and impatient Wall Street investors prematurely dismissed Dragon and DreamWorks Animation after its less-than-stellar opening weekend two weeks ago. The company’s stock dropped 8% on the first trading day after the debut with analysts lowering their estimates for the final domestic take to just $152M. Dragon will now crush that mark next weekend and looks on course to break the $200M barrier too becoming the second biggest 3D toon of all-time behind just the $293M of Up.[rtimage]MapID=1194522&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=25&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Beating Pixar’s Oscar winner may not be possible, but outgrossing other competitors like Monsters vs. Aliens, Ice Age 3, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs makes Dragon a powerful performer. The PG-rated film was indeed slow out of the gate, but amazing word-of-mouth coupled with school holidays for spring have made Dragon the must-see film for kids and parents. Competition for families and 3D screens remains extremely light for the next five weeks so the Viking pic’s strong run should continue. Reaching $250M cannot be ruled out at this point given the road ahead since Dragon will be able to earn at least five times its opening figure, if not more.[rtimage]MapID=1210444&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Tyler Perry’s latest film Why Did I Get Married Too? followed his usual pattern – big opening, big drop. The Lionsgate release grossed an estimated $11M in its second frame tumbling 62% for a ten-day tally of $48.5M. A final take of roughly $65M seems likely. Fellow sophomore The Last Song starring Miley Cyrus fared much better declining by just 37% to an estimated $10M. With $42.4M in 12 days, Disney should reach a similar $65M.The Mouse House also claimed the number six slot with its 3D juggernaut Alice in Wonderland which grossed an estimated $5.6M, off only 32%, for a $319.3M cume. The Johnny Depp smash now sits at number 22 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters behind Shrek the Third which hauled in $321M in 2007. The ogre returns next month with his own 3D installment.[rtimage]MapID=1200459&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A trio of comedies followed. The time-travel pic Hot Tub Time Machine took in an estimated $5.4M, down 33%, for a $37M total for MGM. Sony’s The Bounty Hunter dipped 29% to an estimated $4.3M for a $56M sum to date. And the kidpic em&gt;Diary of a Wimpy Kid eased by just 23% grossing an estimated $4.1M for Fox lifting the cume to $53.8M.Vivendi opened the faith-based drama Letters to God in tenth place with weak results. The PG-rated film about a boy battling cancer bowed to an estimated $1.3M from 897 locations – very wide for this type of pic – for a poor $1,394 average.The top ten films grossed an estimated $121M which was off 1% from last year which was Easter when Hannah Montana The Movie opened in the top spot with $32.3M; but up 56% from 2008 when Prom Night debuted at number one with $20.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"zombie, watch, history","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Date-Night-Battles-Titans-for-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509135694744","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dragon Retakes the Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dragon Retakes the Top SpotThe Dreamworks Animation film claims #1 in the worst Box Office weekend so far this year.by Gitesh Pandya | April 26, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, with Hollywood dumping its weakest films into theaters, moviegoers understandably stayed away from the multiplexes as the North American box office slumped to its lowest level of the year. New releases The Back-up Plan and The Losers generated unimpressive results allowing the five-week old 3D cartoon How to Train Your Dragon to reclaim the number one spot thanks to its continued durability. For the first time all year the top ten films failed to gross at least $90M.After coming within a hair of nabbing the box office crown last weekend, How To Train Your Dragon won a decisive victory this time grossing an estimated $15M in its fifth weekend for another slim decline of only 24%. The DreamWorks blockbuster has now amassed a fantastic $178M and should bust through the $200M mark the same weekend as when Paramount stablemate Iron Man 2 arrives to kick off the summer movie season. The Viking toon is still on course to finish its run in the neighborhood of $225M which would be more than five times its opening weekend take thanks to amazing legs. Dragon‘s drops to date have been 34%, 14%, 21%, and 24%.[rtimage]MapID=1194522&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fans didn’t exactly turn out in large numbers for Jennifer Lopez who returned to theaters with her first major wide release in five years. Her pregnancy comedy The Back-up Plan collected an estimated $12.3M from a very wide 3,280 locations for a lackluster $3,735 average. Slammed by poor reviews, the PG-13 film about a woman who finds Mr. Right after being impregnated artificially played mostly to adult women, and failed to appeal to a broader audience. Females made up 71% of the audience, 57% were over 30, and 21% were Latino, according to distributor CBS Films. This is only the company’s second release following the disastrous Brendan Fraser-Harrison Ford flop Extraordinary Measures which debuted to a terrible $6M and $2,363 average in January.Lopez has generally been a reliable draw at the box office with her films and the opening of Plan does not necessarily mean she no longer has box office clout any more. The generic story, lack of additional starpower, and poor marks from critics all helped to prevent an opening like those of her past films. The last major Lopez vehicle was 2005’s Monster-in-Law which bowed at number one with $23.1M in May, a month usually topped by big-budget action films each weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1226387&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=30&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Audiences made Date Night the number three choice again this weekend as the Steve Carell-Tina Fey comedy slipped just 37% to an estimated $10.6M. Fox has laughed up a solid $63.5M in 17 days and could be headed for the $90M mark.Opening in fourth with weak results was the action film The Losers with an estimated $9.6M from 2,936 locations for a poor $3,271 average. The Warner Bros. release featuring Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan didn’t have the starpower to pull in paying audiences and the story involving a group of renegade ex-soldiers seeking revenge on a criminal mastermind failed to spark any interest. Reviews were mixed for the PG-13 pic.Kick-Ass stumbled in its second weekend falling 52% to an estimated $9.5M giving the super hero flick $34.9M in ten days. Lionsgate should end up with roughly $55M from its much-buzzed-about action film. The 3D action pic Clash of the Titans grossed an estimated $9M, off 42%, pushing the total for Warner Bros. up to $145.6M. Sony’s comedy remake Death at a Funeral tumbled 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $8M. With $28.4M in ten days, the Chris Rock-Martin Lawrence film should finish its run with $45-50M.[rtimage]MapID=1217700&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=17&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s new underwater documentary Oceans scored the best per-theater average of any film in wide release this weekend. The G-rated pic debuted in moderate national release with 1,206 locations and grossed an estimated $6M for a $4,975 average. Add in grosses from the Thursday opening on Earth Day when it ranked number one in the marketplace and the four-day cume stands at $8.5M. On a per-theater basis, the bow was almost identical to the studio’s doc from this same frame last year when Earth bowed to $8.8M from a wider debut in 1,804 sites for a $4,892 average.The Mouse House rounded out the top ten with a pair of hits. The Miley Cyrus teen romance The Last Song dropped 38% to an estimated $3.7M for a $55.4M total to date. Alice in Wonderland, the biggest non-Pandora 3D movie of all-time, fell 39% to an estimated $2.2M boosting the total to $327.5M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $85.9M which was down 14% from last year when Obsessed opened in the top spot with $28.6M; but up 13% from 2008 when Baby Mama debuted at number one with $17.4M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Day, Mudbound, italian, crime, Network, York, child's, america, war, DC, rom-coms, Dates","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Dragon-Retakes-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509135687572","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Shrek dethrones Iron Man 2","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Shrek dethrones Iron Man 2Plus, Robin Hood slips to third, and MacGruber, well, bombs.by Sujit Chawla | May 24, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend The fourth film in the Shrek series took the box office crown in the fourth weekend of the 2010 summer movie season, but with a much smaller gross than anticipated. Meanwhile, the SNL curse continued as Universal’s MacGruber crashed and burned on impact.Shrek Forever After took charge of the box office this weekend, debuting to $71.3M from 4,359 locations (which includes 194 IMAX and 2373 3D screens) for a per screen average of $16,345. The opening, while extremely good for most movies, is a big let down for the franchise.Each film in the Shrek series had a higher opening weekend gross than the previous one (taking into account that Shrek 2 opened on a Wednesday). While Shrek Forever After wasn’t expected to meet the heights of Shrek the Third, with the 3D and IMAX surcharges added in to a huge theater count, the $72M has to be seen as disappointing. As you can also see, the opening weekend percentage of the final total has been going up as well, as the grosses become more and more front loaded. With less-than-stellar reviews it is distinctly possible that Shrek Forever After may not make as much money as stablemate How To Train Your Dragon, which is currently at $211M and counting.[rtimage]MapID=1194517&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=35&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After two weeks in the top spot, Robert Downey, Jr. and Iron Man 2 took a step back into the second spot this weekend, falling 49% to an estimated $26.6M, bringing its cume to $251.3M. By comparison, the original Iron Man had grossed $223.1M by the end of its third weekend back in 2008. Third place belonged to fellow hero Robin Hood which fell 48% from last weekend to an estimated $18.7M, bringing its total to $66.1M. Look for a final gross in the $115-120M range.We’re now at fourth place with still no sighting of MacGruber… Taking up residence in the fourth spot was Summit Entertainment’s Letters to Juliet, which took in an estimated $9.1M this weekend, a drop of only 33% from last weekend’s opening. Its cume now stands at $27.4M and it looks to end its run in the $55-60M range.

It’s MacGruber! Oh no, he didn’t make it! Crashing into sixth place this weekend, the Saturday Night Live sketch-turned-movie bombed at the box office, pulling in only $4.1M, according to estimates, from 2,551 screens for a per screen average of $1,607. The $4.1M opening is one of the worst openings of all time from a film with at least 2,500 screens. How bad was this opening? 1999’s Chill Factor, starring that dynamic duo of Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Skeet Ulrich opened to $4.5M from 2,558 theaters.Seventh place belonged to the film that just wouldn’t quit, Date Night, which had the best hold in the top 10, dropping a slim 26% to an estimated $2.8M. Its total now stands at $90.6M. In eighth place was the horror remake A Nightmare on Elm Street which fell 51% to an estimated $2.3M, bringing its cume to $59.9M. It looks to end its run with a total nearly identical to 2009’s remake du jour, Friday the 13th which finished with $65M.[rtimage]MapID=1211478&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=21&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]DreamWorks Animation’s second film in the top 10 ended up in 9th place this weekend as How to Train Your Dragon fell sharply with the latest animation offering taking most of its business.

The big-budget Disney film debuted to a gargantuan $116.3M over the Friday-to-Sunday span, according to estimates, smashing box office records left and right. It was the biggest March opening ever soaring past the $70.9M of 300 from 2007 and the best debut for a 3D film beating the $77M of Avatar from last December.Alice also generated the all-time largest IMAX opening weekend with $11.9M from 188 sites which easily surpassed the $9.5M from 178 locations of Avatar. Plus, the Burton fantasy scored the top opening ever for a non-sequel edging out the $114.8M of 2002’s Spider-Man. The webslinger flick sold more tickets however as admission prices were much lower eight years ago and there were no 3D surcharges involved. Overall, Alice in Wonderland enjoyed the sixth biggest opening weekend in box office history after The Dark Knight ($158.4M), Spider-Man 3 ($151.1M), The Twilight Saga: New Moon ($142.8M), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest ($135.6M), and Shrek the Third ($121.6M). New Moon is the only film opening outside of summer to debut better than the Mad Hatter pic.[rtimage]MapID=1211803&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=24&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Wonderland performance zoomed ahead of industry expectations which were mostly in the $70M range. The starpower of Depp and Burton combined with the new eccentric 3D spin on a familiar fairy tale made for a must-see event. Disney’s marketing push was powerful and the utter lack of compelling film choices for kids since Christmas helped to fuel demand. Four of the next five films on the chart were rated R. The studio must now send a thank you card to Depp as the actor has anchored the three biggest openings in company history – Dead Man’s Chest, Alice, and Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End ($114.7M). It should come as no surprise that a fourth Jack Sparrow pic is in the works with a release date set for May 20 of next year.The actor-director combo attracted more lackluster numbers for their last two films Sweeney Todd and Corpse Bride which were more experimental movies. Alice in Wonderland carried the Disney brand name and a PG rating, despite a smoking caterpillar, and featured very broad appeal exciting teens and young adults as well as families. The Alice bow more than doubled the $56.2M opening of the duo’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which was a huge achievement at the time.[rtimage]MapID=1211803&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=27&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Avatar and Alice have reinforced the industry’s faith in 3D technology, and its moneymaking potential, as moviegoers clearly have no problem spending extra for the special experience for the right event film. Studios have been feverishly reviewing their upcoming release slates to see which tentpoles can be done in 3D. Also making audiences wear those black glasses this year will be Clash of the Titans, Shrek Forever After, Toy Story 3, and the next Harry Potter film among others.Opening in 40 additional territories overseas, Alice in Wonderland commanded a giant opening weekend haul of $94M offshore bringing the total global debut to an eye-popping $210.3M. That was more than enough to end Avatar‘s 11-week reign at number one at the international box office and there are major markets like France, Spain, Japan, and China still to come. Depp’s incredible worldwide appeal will surely carry this title forward around the globe.[rtimage]MapID=1211803&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Two R-rated crime thrillers were virtually neck-and-neck fighting for second place. Final numbers to be reported on Monday could change the order, but Sunday’s estimates showed a slight $200,000 edge for the cop drama Brooklyn’s Finest which debuted with an estimated $13.5M from 1,936 locations. Averaging a strong $6,973 per theater, the Overture release stars Richard Gere, Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawke, and Wesley Snipes and played to an adult ethnic audience. According to studio research, 60% of the crowd was African American with a total of 86% being non-Caucasian. 52% was female and 60% was over 30. Reviews were mostly negative.Brooklyn beat Shutter Island on Friday, lagged behind on Saturday, and is estimated to win Sunday by a slim margin. The Saturday-to-Sunday declines are estimated at 35% by Overture for Brooklyn and 46% by Paramount for Shutter. The two films could end up swapping positions when final numbers are counted.[rtimage]MapID=1198124&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Close behind in third place for now was Shutter Island which followed two weeks at number one with a estimated $13.3M in its third round. The 41% decline was commendable given the record opening of Alice which played to a broad audience. Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio had to make room for that other director-actor team but have upped their cume to an impressive $95.8M. Paramount will break the $100M mark on Thursday or Friday.The Bruce Willis-Tracy Morgan police comedy Cop Out ranked fourth with an estimated $9.1M in its second weekend dropping by an understandable 50%. With $32.4M in ten days, Warner Bros. seems headed for $50-55M.Jake Sully and company took fifth as Avatar suffered the largest drop of its 12-week run thanks to Alice seizing control of most of the nation’s 3D screens this weekend. The James Cameron juggernaut fell 44% to an estimated $7.7M and lifted its mammoth cume to $720.2M from North America. It had never fallen by more than 31% before. The overseas drop was slightly better with the Pandora pic grossing an estimated $21.7M, off 40%, boosting the international tally to $1.88 billion. The worldwide take now stands at a towering $2.6 billion. The historic run may end in the neighborhood of $2.75 billion.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=15&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The horror flick The Crazies dropped by 56% in its second weekend to an estimated $7M for Overture for a $27.4M cume in ten days. A $40M final seems likely which is good for a fright flick. Fox’s fantasy Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians collected an estimated $5.1M, down 47%, raising its total to $78M.The hit date movie Valentine’s Day followed in eighth falling 53% to an estimated $4.3M bumping the sum to $106.4M. With Oscar gold expected to come its way, Fox Searchlight’s Crazy Heart saw sales climb 36% to an estimated $3.4M giving the Jeff Bridges film $29.6M to date. Dear John rounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.9M, off 41%, for a $76.7M gross.[rtimage]MapID=1220192&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In limited release, Summit re-released its Academy Awards darling The Hurt Locker into 276 theaters and collected an estimated $439,000 for a mild $1,602 average. The Kathryn Bigelow-directed film has been available on DVD since January 12, but the distributor wanted to capture some sales from those who missed it last summer (which includes almost everyone) and wanted to see it on the big screen. It is also positioned to capture post-Oscar business too and will take advantage of all the free publicity. Total to date is still a modest $14.7M.The top ten films grossed a stunning estimate of $182.5M which was up a whopping 87% from last year when Watchmen opened in the top spot with $55.2M; and up a staggering 110% from 2008 when 10,000 B.C. debuted at number one with $35.9M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Mirror, DC, drama, Mystery, Century, The, Countdown, 007, 2015","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Alice-Dazzles-Audiences"},{"id":"47509134077840","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Toy Story 3 Soars to No. 1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Toy Story 3 Soars to No. 1Plus, The Karate Kid stays strong, but Jonah Hex tanks.by Gitesh Pandya | June 21, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, Pixar once again showed off its box office muscle with the record opening for Toy Story 3 which delivered the best debut in company history. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the comic book-inspired Jonah Hex was shot dead on arrival suffering one of the worst openings ever for a summer action film. The overall marketplace bounced back after a few sluggish weeks with the top ten reaching a stellar $184M — the second best performance of 2010 including holiday frames.Disney and Pixar scored their eleventh consecutive hit with Toy Story 3 which bowed at number one with a staggering $109M, according to estimates. The G-rated reteaming of Woody the Cowboy, Buzz Lightyear, and other memorable characters generated a red hot $27,061 from 4,028 theaters helped by higher 3D ticket prices. It was the second biggest opening ever for a 3D film after Alice in Wonderland‘s $116.1M from March and the second highest for an animated film trailing Shrek the Third‘s $121.6M from 2007. Woody and Buzz also tied the $109M opening of last summer’s Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen for number ten on the list of all-time biggest debuts and number one on the list of best June premieres.[rtimage]MapID=1196045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Critics were all raves for Toy Story 3 which was not surprising since Pixar films hardly ever attract bad reviews. The animation studio’s previous best debut was $70.5M for 2004’s The Incredibles which translates to about $85M at today’s 2D prices. Last summer’s Up was Pixar’s first 3D entry and bowed to $68.1M but Story‘s built-in audience helped to bring out a larger audience on opening weekend.Toy Story 3 launched on Friday with a stunning $41M ranking as the largest opening day ever for an animated film. The CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A. Surprisingly, Saturday sales actually dropped 10% to $37M. Family films tend to jump up on Saturdays but Friday was bigger for Toy due to so many schools being out for the summer and the nature of sequels attracting more demand upfront. Plus, the Friday gross included healthy midnight sales from Thursday night. Shrek Forever After, another recent 3D toon that was a sequel, enjoyed a solid 39% bump on its first Saturday, however schools were all in session in mid-May.[rtimage]MapID=1196045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=36&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The road ahead is still expected to be a bright one for Toy Story 3 thanks to amazing reviews, strong word-of-mouth, and more schools closing for the summer everyday this week. The Independence Day holiday session is not too far away either and will lead to continued strength into July.After a surprisingly strong opening weekend, Sony’s hit remake The Karate Kid fell 48% to an estimated $29M and broke the $100M mark after just ten days of release. The decline was not bad considering the competition for families that Toy Story gave. Total stands at $106.3M to date with the Jaden Smith vehicle possibly heading for the neighborhood of $175M. That would be some Father’s Day gift to producer-dad Will Smith beating many of his own blockbusters like I, Robot, Shark Tale, and the Bad Boys films.[rtimage]MapID=1226668&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The A-Team dropped a moderate 46% to an estimated $13.8M in its second weekend boosting its ten-day total to $49.8M. Fox’s 1980s nostalgia trip looks to end its run with $80-90M. Universal’s rock star comedy Get Him to the Greek held up well in its third frame with an estimated $6.1M, off 39%, for a $47.9M cume.Four films snuggled into the tight $5M to $5.5M range according to estimates from their distributors. Final grosses to be reported on Monday could see a change in the rankings. With Buzz Lightyear taking away the 3D toon audience, Shrek Forever After tumbled 65% to an estimated $5.5M bumping its total to $223M. A final gross of $230-235M seems likely. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time enjoyed a remarkably impressive hold dipping only 19% to an estimated $5.3M giving Disney $80.5M to date. Killers followed with an estimated $5.1M, down 36%, for a $39.4M sum for Lionsgate.[rtimage]MapID=1229157&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=32&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Eighth place saw the debut of the year’s biggest disaster, Jonah Hex. The PG-13 comic adaptation grossed a microscopic $5.1M from 2,825 theaters for a puny $1,800 average. The Warner Bros. release generated no interest with moviegoers and won over no fans with critics either. Even the reliable comic book crowd stayed away from this one. Starring Josh Brolin, Megan Fox, and John Malkovich, Hex never caught on as a must-see film with audiences and was not based on material with much of a built-in fan base. Rolling the dice with films based on Iron Man, Green Lantern, and Thor make some kind of sense, but nobody asked for a Jonah Hex movie. The turnout was even worse than for Fox’s last film Jennifer’s Body which bowed to $6.9M in the weak month of September. The only good news for Hex is that the film didn’t cost too much. Its reported production budget was about $40M.Rounding out the top ten with estimates of $2.7M a piece were Paramount’s comic book hero Iron Man 2 and Fox’s comic strip pooch Marmaduke. The super hero blockbuster fell 41% raising its total to $304M putting it at number 33 on the list of all-time domestic hits. The dog pic tumbled 56% and has collected a mere $27.9M thus far.[rtimage]MapID=1223778&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The critically-acclaimed comedy Cyrus became the summer’s first major indie hit with its platform bow in just four theaters in New York and Los Angeles resulting in an estimated $180,000 for a scorching $45,000 average. The Fox Searchlight release stars John C. Reilly, Jonah Hill, Marisa Tomei, and Catherine Keener and expands to more cities in the weeks ahead.The top ten films grossed an estimated $184.2M which was up 32% from last year when The Proposal opened in the top spot with $33.6M; and up 36% from 2008 when Get Smart debuted at number one with $38.7M.Written by Gitesh Pandya of Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"and, Poppins, heist, twilight, ABC, Bravo","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Toy-Story-3-Soars-to-No-1"},{"id":"47509135684498","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Shrek Still King Over Sluggish Frame","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Shrek Still King Over Sluggish FrameNo sugar and spice for Splice.by Gitesh Pandya | June 7, 2010 |  CommentsThe summer box office slump spilled into a new month as the North Americanbox office delivered the worst June frame in five years. Four new releasestargeting different audiences were sprinkled throughout the top ten but nonemanaged to unseat reigning chart king Shrek Forever Afterwhich held the number one spot for the third straight time. Ticket sales wereonce again down sharply compared to last year as the films Hollywood hasprogrammed are still not generating the usual summer excitement.Shrek ForeverAfter became the first of the four ogre toons to top the box office forthree consecutive weekends as the 3D pic grossed an estimated $25.3M falling bya relatively light 42% from the Friday-to-Sunday portion of last weekend’sMemorial Day holiday session. It was the smallest drop suffered by any widerelease. Paramount and DreamWorks Animation have taken in $183M after 17 dayswhich still trails the performances of the previous Mike Myers sequels. Shrek 2,the top-grosser of the franchise, had collected $314.5M by this point whileShrek the Third stood at $255.9M. Those films had lower ticket prices and no 3Dsurcharges. Forever After is on track to finish its run in the vicinity of$250M.[rtimage]MapID=1194517&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=41&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Universalenjoyed a solid opening for its raunchy comedy Get Himto the Greek which laughed up an estimated $17.4M leading a quartet ofnew releases. The R-rated film about a record company assistant assigned toescort an unstable rock star from London to Los Angeles averaged a good $6,460from 2,697 theaters. Jonah Hill, Russell Brand, and Sean Combs starred and JuddApatow produced. The debut was almost identical to the $17.7M second place bowand $6,335 average of 2008’s Forgetting Sarah Marshall which inspired the AldousSnow character played by Brand in Greek. Both films were directed by NicholasStoller. Budgeted at $40M, Greek skewed a bit towards adult men as studioresearch showed that 53% of the audience was male while 55% was under30.[rtimage]MapID=1212410&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=51&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Ashton Kutcherand Katherine Heigl followed close behind in third place with their newaction-comedy Killerswhich launched with an estimated $16.1M from 2,859 sites for a respectable$5,631 average. The PG-13 film about a woman who discovers after getting marriedthat her husband is a secret assassin opened a few notches below the $20.2Mdebut of Kutcher’s last summer offering What Happens in Vegas with Cameron Diazfrom May 2008. Killers was not screened for the press before its release, butcritics reviewing it on opening day panned the film.[rtimage]MapID=10011824&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disneysaw a steep 54% drop for its expensive adventure film Princeof Persia: The Sands of Time which grossed an estimated $13.9M followingits disappointing holiday opening. With only $59.5M collected after ten days,the Jerry Bruckheimer production looks to end its run near the $90M mark.Overseas and home video revenue need to be stellar in order to recoup theestimated $150-200M in production costs plus the additional cash spent onworldwide marketing.Suffering the worst decline of any film in the top ten was Sex and the City 2which tumbled 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $12.7M. Warner Bros. hasbanked only $73.4M in 11 days trailing 28% behind the $101.8M that the first Sex rang up in the same number of days. The gals should end up near the$100M mark at the end of the domestic run.Fox learned this weekend that Marmaduke is no Marley &amp; Me. The new comic strip pic bowed to an estimated $11.3M from 3,213theaters for a lackluster $3,517 average and did not come close to the $36.4Mdebut of the studio’s other Owen Wilson-led dog flick. Marmaduke wasbased on a property with only limited popularity and it lacked the dazzle of 3Dthat kids are now used to from other family films. With The Karate Kidopening Friday and ToyStory 3 in 3D debuting a week later, the road ahead looks difficult forthe Great Dane.[rtimage]MapID=1226669&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Paramountand Marvel took in an estimated $7.8M with Iron Man 2, off53%, raising the total to $291.3M.

Next week should see the Robert Downey Jr. hitjoin its predecessor in the $300M club.Opening poorly in eighth was Splice, a newsci-fi horror entry released by Warner Bros., with an estimated $7.5M. TheR-rated thriller averaged just $3,041 from 2,450 locations and became the latestfright flick to fail to connect with paying audiences during the early summerperiod which has never been kind to the genre.

Fox’s tween comedy Diary of a Wimpy Kid beat expectations to open in second place while Sony’s Jennifer Aniston-Gerard Butler vehicle The Bounty Hunter enjoyed a solid debut of its own close behind in third. But Universal’s new action entry Repo Men flopped in fourth with a miserable showing. The overall box office was up over 2009 for the fourth straight weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1211803&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Audiences lined up again for some 3D fun with Johnny Depp with Alice in Wonderland easily defending its crown with an estimated $34.5M in its third round boosting the 17-day cume to a stellar $265.8M. It was Disney’s first three-peat at number one since Depp’s megahit Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest from July 2006. Staying atop the box office chart for this long is rare these days. Outside of Avatar, the last film to spend three weekends in first place was Tropic Thunder from the summer of 2008.Alice smashed the $250M mark on Saturday after only 16 days and looks headed for the $350M mark. The Tim Burton pic is already the second highest-grossing film to ever open in the January-to-April corridor trailing just The Passion of the Christ which hauled in $370.3M in 2004 after a late February debut. This weekend, Alice also joined the list of the Top 50 all-time domestic blockbusters sitting at number 45 between Shrek ($267.7M) and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets ($262M).[rtimage]MapID=1211236&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fox posted brawny numbers for its kidpic Diary of a Wimpy Kid from 3,077 playdates for a strong $7,085 average. Based on the popular middle school-set book, the PG-rated film had no stars but instead capitalized on a built-in audience of fans attracting an impressive amount of business considering how Alice in Wonderland is still playing well to kids of all ages. With a budget of under $20M, the studio should not only see a healthy profit from box office and DVD sales but will also have a new franchise since there are still three more books in the series that can keep the cash coming in. Studio research indicated that 59% of the audience was under 25 and 51% was female. Fox is expecting upcoming spring and Easter school closings to keep the film going.[rtimage]MapID=10012049&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Opening close behind in third place was the battle-of-the-exes film The Bounty Hunter which seized an estimated $21M from 3,074 theaters for a solid $6,831 average. The PG-13 pic starring Gerard Butler as a bounty hunter assigned to capture his bail-jumping ex-wife played by Jennifer Aniston catered to an audience of adult women. Studio research showed that 58% of the crowd was female with the 50/50 age split at 30 instead of 25. The opening was almost identical to the $21.6M debut of 2008’s Fool’s Gold starring Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson. Both were battle-of-the-sexes action-comedies directed by Andy Tennant with poor reviews that were sold on the starpower of the beautiful people on screen. Gold, which enjoyed a holiday on its second weekend, ended with $70.2M and Bounty could approach the same vicinity which would be an encouraging performance given the budget that was in the low $40M range. Overseas potential looks solid as Aniston has been a bankable draw and Butler has seen his star wattage rise in the last year.[rtimage]MapID=1226671&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=39&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The new sci-fi actioner Repo Men failed to capture any meaningful business in its first weekend with a poor opening of $6.2M, according to estimates. The ultraviolent R-rated pic starring Jude Law and Forest Whitaker averaged a wimpy $2,440 for Universal from 2,521 theaters. Critics panned the futuristic film.[rtimage]MapID=1202804&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Universal found more bad news in fifth place as its other March action title Green Zone tumbled 58% to an estimated $6M for a weak ten-day total of only $24.7M. The studio did what it could to hide the film’s Iraq setting and pushed it instead as a film from the Jason Bourne guys but audiences didn’t buy into it. With a production cost of more than $100M, Zone will end up with a domestic take of just $35-40M. The early overseas tally is $20.4M with many markets still to open, but recovering production and marketing costs internationally will also be a challenging task.[rtimage]MapID=1208134&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Paramount claimed the next two spots with the comedy She’s Out of My League which grossed an estimated $5.9M and the thriller Shutter Island which took in an estimated $4.8M. The R-rated laugher declined by only 40% in its second round and upped its ten-day sum to $20M with a $35M final likely – not bad for a low-profile and inexpensive pic that is sure to do even better on DVD. The Scorsese-DiCaprio flick dropped 41% and has banked $115.8M to date.Avatar spent its 14th weekend in the top ten with an estimated $4M, off 39%, and a $736.9M cume. Fox’s overseas total climbed to $1.937 billion making the global haul $2.674 billion. Fox Searchlight’s Our Family Wedding fell 50% to an estimated $3.8M for $13.7M in ten days. Fellow sophomore Remember Me crumbled 60% to an estimated $3.3M giving Summit only $13.9M to date. Final grosses will be near the $20M mark for each.[rtimage]MapID=1223281&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In limited release, Focus scored the best average with its Ben Stiller pic Greenberg which bowed to an estimated $120,432 from only three sites for a muscular $40,144 average. Anchor Bay averaged a sturdy $17,500 from each of two locations for its Andy Garcia film City Island. The 45-minute IMAX science film Hubble 3D debuted to an estimated $453,000 from 39 large-screen venues for a $11,608 average. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo opened to an estimated $340,408 from 34 for a $10,012 average for Music Box.

Paramount released the Marvel production in a mammoth 4,380 theaters including 181 venues with IMAX screens making it the widest bow in history edging out the 4,366-theater release of The Dark Knight in July 2008. The new Tony Stark film averaged a scorching $30,502 per site.\n[rtimage]MapID=1197264&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=97&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nHollywood’s only blockbusters to open bigger were Knight with $158.4M, Spider-Man 3 with $151.1M, The Twilight Saga: New Moon with $142.8M, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest with $135.6M. Iron Man 2 registered the largest debut in company history for Paramount beating Shrek the Third‘s $121.6M and was second-best among May titles behind another Marvel sequel launching over the first weekend of the month – the third Spidey flick.\nRobert Downey Jr. once again played the title role with Jon Favreau directing and Gwenyth Paltrow co-starring. New players this time for the $170M production were Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, and Don Cheadle. Samuel L. Jackson’s cameo in the first installment was expanded into a supporting role this time giving the actor the coveted ‘and’ credit. Rourke snagged the almost-as-cool ‘with’ credit. Numerous promotional partners added marketing muscle to the campaign including Burger King, Audi, 7-Eleven, Dr. Pepper, Oracle, and Hershey’s Reese’s brand. \n[rtimage]MapID=1197264&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=89&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nFans powered the first Iron Man to an opening of $102.1M (including Thursday night shows starting at 8pm) two years ago over the first weekend of May ahead of a leggy run that reached $318.4M. The sequel’s opening was 31% better and benefited from 7% more theaters, two years of ticket price increases, and the addition of an IMAX release which took advantage of higher ticket prices. IM2 set a new record for biggest 2D IMAX opening with $10.2M from 181 screens beating the $8.5M from 138 of last May’s Star Trek, also a Paramount release.\nAs with its predecessor, Iron Man 2 scored an encouraging A grade from CinemaScore indicating great satisfaction from paying audiences. Critics were not as enthusiastic this time around but in general reviews were good, especially for a comic book sequel. Exit polls showed that 60% of the crowd was male and 60% was over 25. Friday kicked off with a stunning $52.3M in ticket sales including $7.5M in Thursday night post-midnight shows, Saturday dipped 11% to $46.5M, and Sunday is estimated to slide by 25% to $34.9M. The metal man accounted for a whopping 78% of all sales for the top ten movies this weekend as competition hardly existed and rival studios steered clear of releasing anything big against it.\n[rtimage]MapID=1197264&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=41&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nOverseas, where the Stark gang debuted a week earlier, ticket sales hit an estimated $57.2M this weekend lifting the international tally to $194M. That makes for a massive $190.8M global weekend gross and a $327.6M cume to date worldwide in under two weeks. Even with large sequel-type declines in the weeks ahead, Iron Man 2 should have no problem zooming past the $582M global haul of its predecessor paving the way for a third chapter which Marvel is already planning.\n[rtimage]MapID=1211478&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nFreddy Krueger took a tumble as expected. The horror remake A Nightmare on Elm Street fell a sharp 72% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.2M putting it in a distant second place. It was a larger sophomore fall than those for other fright redos like Halloween (64%) and Prom Night (58%) but did not reach the incredibly high 80% crash suffered by Friday the 13th last year. With $48.5M in ten days, Nightmare should end up with a solid $60-65M nearly matching the $65M of the Jason remake.\n[rtimage]MapID=1194522&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nHolding up well yet again in its seventh weekend of release was the 3D sensation How To Train Your Dragon which slipped only 36% to an estimated $6.8M boosting the hit toon into the double-century club with $201.1M to date. A final domestic take of $220-225M seems likely.\nFox’s leggy comedy hit Date Night followed with an estimated $5.3M in its fifth weekend, down only 30%, for a $80.9M cume to date. The Jennifer Lopez pic The Back-up Plan dropped 40% to an estimated $4.3M giving CBS Films $29.4M thus far.\nSummit’s family flop Furry Vengeance fell 40% to an estimated $4M resulting in a poor ten-day tally of just $11.6M. Clash of the Titans took a big hit from Iron Man 2 tumbling 61% to an estimated $2.3M. After its sixth frame, the Warner Bros. 3D adventure has banked $157.8M.\n[rtimage]MapID=1226860&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=47&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nChris Rock’s latest comedy Death at a Funeral followed with an estimated $2.1M, off 49%, for a $38.3M sum for Sony. The Losers ranked ninth collapsing 69% to an estimated $1.8M with $21.5M to date for Warner Bros.\n[rtimage]MapID=1226677&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nThree films fought over tenth place with estimated grosses between $1.5M and $1.6M but if Sunday estimates are to be believed, the documentary Babies narrowly won the race. Opening to weak results, the PG-rated film about the first year of life for four babies growing up in different parts of the world grossed an estimated $1.6M from 534 theaters for a lackluster $2,951 average. Focus went unusually wide with the launch as most non-Michael Moore documentaries do not bow in this many theaters on the first weekend. Disney’s nature films Oceans and Earth are two examples of wide releases for the genre as both were tied into Earth Day. Babies was slated for Mother’s Day weekend, however its target audience of new parents rarely get time to go out to the movies at that stage of life. A much larger crowd is likely to catch it on DVD and VOD. Reviews for the French-produced doc were generally positive.\nThe top ten films grossed an estimated $171M which was up 23% from last year when Star Trek opened in the top spot with $75.2M ($79.2M including Thursday night); and up 48% from 2008 when Iron Man remained at number one with $51.2M. During those two years, this was the second weekend of summer and not the kickoff.\n                                            \n                \n            ","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"comic, Pet, movies, Comics, Hallmark, dramedy, christmas, wars, Games, cinemax, Emmys","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Iron-Man-2-Draws-Fifth-Biggest-Opening-of-AllTime"},{"id":"47509135683473","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Karate Kid K.O.s the Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Karate Kid K.O.s the CompetitionPlus, The A-Team claims #2, while Shrek finally loses the top spot.by Gitesh Pandya | June 14, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, eleven-year-old Jaden Smith defeated four grown men in a battle of the 1980s remakes as The Karate Kid soared above expectations easily outgunning The A-Team at the North American box office. Kid powered its way to an estimated $56M over the weekend from 3,663 theaters for a sensational $15,288 average.Produced for only $40M, the PG-rated film presented a modern take on the 1984 Ralph Macchio-Pat Morita favorite and starred Jackie Chan as the mentor. The setting was shifted to Beijing and despite the title, the film centered on kung fu instead of karate. Sony launched the marketing campaign with a highly effective trailer that used the son of Will to generate excitement with kids while also using nostalgia to pump up parents and other adults. Add in an end-credit song from teen sensation Justin Bieber (with a rap by Jaden) and a much-talked-about promotion at last weekend’s MTV Movie Awards and young people were hyped up and ready to buy tickets.[rtimage]MapID=1226668&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Despite a lengthy 140-minute running time, Karate pleased audiences with an encouraging A CinemaScore grade and even scored an exceptionally high 94% in the top two boxes from exit polls. Females made up 53% of the crowd while 56% was under 25. It was the ninth biggest June opening of all-time and sixth best when only counting live-action films. Will Smith routinely opens summer blockbusters in the $50M range and contributes to his own soundtracks and now has a son following in his footsteps. Overseas potential is formidable especially across Asia.Opening far back in second place was The A-Team with an estimated $26M coming in below expectations. The Fox release launched very wide in 3,535 locations and averaged $7,355 per theater. A remake of the 1980s action television series, the PG-13 film starring Liam Neeson and Bradley Cooper witnessed a slight 4% dip on Saturday and may not have the positive buzz needed for a long summer run. Reviews were mixed. In the battle of the 80s flicks, The A-Team and The Karate Kid were expected to have been much closer in ticket sales this weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1197695&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After a three-week reign at number one, Shrek Forever After continued to show off the strong legs seen by most 3D films these days. The ogre flick declined by only 38% which was impressive given how much Karate Kid was taking away business from family audiences. Forever broke the $200M mark and boosted its cume to $210.1M.Universal’s Get Him to the Greek enjoyed the smallest decline among last weekend’s four new releases dipping 43% to an estimated $10.1M in fourth place. The raunchy rock star comedy has collected $36.5M in ten days and could be headed for a finish in the neighborhood of $65M. Fellow sophomore Killers fell by 48% to an estimated $8.2M giving Lionsgate $30.7M. Look for a $50M final.[rtimage]MapID=10011824&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Filling up the next four spots were a video game, comic strip, television show, and comic book all turned into feature films. Tumbling 53% to an estimated $6.6M was Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time which has collected just $72.3M in 17 days for Disney. Fox’s Marmaduke fell 48% in its second round to an estimated $6M putting the ten-day sum at $22.3M. Falling 55% to an estimated $5.5M in its third lap was Sex and the City 2 which has taken in a disappointing $84.7M to date.Iron Man 2 came within a hair of joining the triple-century club with its weekend estimate of $4.6M. Off 43%, the Paramount release jumped up to $299.3M putting it at number 34 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters surpassing the $296.6M of last November’s The Twilight Saga: New Moon.

Debuting far back in second, butalso surging past industry expectations, was Sandra Bullock’s new football picThe Blind Sidewhich got off to a fantastic start. The two new female-driven films attractedover $175M in combined ticket sales leading the top ten to soar to ajaw-dropping $245M.Audiences wanted monster love as The TwilightSaga: New Moon stunned the film industry by beating what were alreadysky-high expectations opening to an estimated $140.7M over the Friday-to-Sundayperiod. That gave Summit the third best opening weekend ever trailing the superhero duo of TheDark Knight ($158.4M in July 2008) and Spider-Man 3($151.1M in May 2007). However, New Moon did break the all-time recordsfor highest post-midnight grosses on the night before opening day with $26.3Mand the best opening day with $72.7M. The records were formerly held by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Dark Knight with$22.2M and $67.2M, respectively. The Twilight sequel cost only $50M toproduce while the others cost well over $200M each.[rtimage]MapID=1206167&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=52&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Bella Swan love story grossed more in its first day than its predecessor Twilight did in its entire opening weekend. That film bowed this weekendwith $69.6M on its way to $191.5M from North America and $384M worldwide.Following New Moon‘s record opening day, the PG-13 film tumbled 41% to$43.2M on Saturday and is estimated to drop another 43% to $24.8M on Sunday. TheFriday-to-Saturday decline was identical to Twilight‘s which is quiteremarkable given how the new installment had much more fan hysteria surroundingit and 605 more theaters leading one to think it would absorb more of its totalbusiness upfront on the first day. Both installments earned 52% of the totalweekend gross on Friday.Other records set include best November bow and best non-summer openingsurpassing the $102.3M of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which had set both of thosemilestones four years ago this very weekend. Young women have been the drivingforce behind the Cullen franchise since the publication of the popular books,but mature women have also made up a sizable portion of the fan base. Studioresearch showed that 80% of the audience this weekend was female with those overand under age 21 evenly split. That translates to females under the age of 21spending about $56M this weekend to see Kristin Stewart choose between RobertPattinson and Taylor Lautner.[rtimage]MapID=1206167&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=50&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]As if the domestic performance was not impressive enough, New Moonattacked 25 foreign markets this weekend too and hauled in an estimated $118.1Mmaking for a staggering global debut of $258.8M. Summit has worldwide rights buthas assorted distributors doing the releases across the globe. The company hasalready filmed the third pic in the series, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,which will be ready for a June 30 release when students will be out of schooland ready for more from the vampire-werewolf teen tale. The date is theWednesday before the long Independence Day holiday frame.Led by Twilight, the overall marketplace surged to the second highesttotal in box office history trailing only the July 18-20 frame last year when The Dark Knight had its record bow and Mamma Mia debuted well insecond. The Top 20 that frame pulled in $257.6M while this weekend’s will comevery close with $254M, if estimates hold. Also amazing this weekend was thatdespite the sheer domination of New Moon, moviegoers still found time tospend another $105M on the rest of the films in the top ten. That bodes well forthe upcoming five-day Thanksgiving holiday session which kicks off on Wednesday.Five months after breaking her career opening weekend record, Sandra Bullock didit again with the football drama The Blind Sidewhich performed much better than expected with a $34.5M debut, according toestimates. The figure edged out the $33.6M bow of her hit summer comedy TheProposal which gave America’s favorite bus driver her previous best mark.Opening in 3,110 locations, the Warner Bros. release averaged a sturdy $11,096per site. Reviews were generally good and football movies often draw largecrowds. Based on a true story, Blind Side tells of a homeless black youthtaken in by a rich white family that helps him launch a successful footballcareer.[rtimage]MapID=1206167&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=54&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The PG-13 film was expected to collect about half as much since its older femaleaudience would be distracted by Twilight which has a large fan base ofmoms. But the marketplace expanded and had plenty of room for both. The blondeBullock’s film skewed 59% female and 75% to those 25 or older, according tostudio research. The road ahead looks bright with the actress set to score hersecond $100M blockbuster of the year after nearly a decade without any.[rtimage]MapID=1212694&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=28&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After ahuge top spot debut last weekend, the doomsday actioner 2012 plunged 59% to anestimated $26.5M and ranked third for the frame. The pricey $200M film hasgrossed $108.2M in ten days in North America and looks to reach the vicinity of$160M domestically. Overseas, the global disaster pic remained a red hotperformer grossing an additional $100.5M to boost its international tally to$341.1M and the worldwide haul to a stunning $449.3M. 2012 is already theseventh biggest global blockbuster of the year and in another week it willshatter the half-billion mark and leap into the top five.Sony didn’t fare too well with the animated comedy Planet 51 whichbowed in fourth with a lukewarm $12.6M, according to estimates. The PG-ratedtoon landed in 3,035 theaters and averaged a mild $4,152 per site. Produced bySpain’s Ilion Animation Studios, the pic features Dwayne Johnson voicing a U.S.astronaut that touches down on a planet he thinks is barren only to discover acivilization of green beings that resembles 1950s America. Reviews were bad andthe 2D look just wasn’t what kids were looking for in a world now dominated by3D animation. Sony is hoping to pick up some more families over the comingholiday weekend, although that audience will get fragmented since Disneylaunches the Robin Williams-John Travolta starrer Old Dogs and Fox goesnationwide with its animated film Fantastic Mr. Fox.[rtimage]MapID=1200415&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=40&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s A Christmas Carol fell 45% to an estimated $12.2M in its third roundpushing the total to $79.8M. The expensive Jim Carrey-starrer will try to crackthe $100M mark over the long Thanksgiving holiday when yuletide movies often seetheir weekend grosses rise.In its third weekend, Lionsgate’s awards contender Precious expandedinto moderate national release and nearly doubled its weekend gross with anestimated $11M. Widening from 174 locations in ten markets to 629 theaters inover 100 cities, the R-rated hit averaged a fantastic $17,501 per location andlifted its total to $21.4M. By comparison, Oscar winner No Country For OldMen expanded nationally this same weekend in 2007 from 148 to 860 theaterswhile also in its third session and grossed $7.8M for a weaker $9,043 average.Its 17-day cume was $16.3M representing just 22% of its eventual $74.3M finaldomestic tally. Precious will add more venues on Wednesday for theholiday weekend.Little cash was left for the rest of the films in the marketplace. Overture’sGeorge Clooney military pic The Men WhoStare at Goats finished in seventh place with an estimated $2.8M, down53%, for a $27.6M total for Overture after 17 days. Universal’s hit comedy Couples Retreatfollowed dropping 53% to an estimated $2M boosting the cume to $105M.

Taking home the silver and bronze medals respectively were the fantasy pic Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians: The Lightning Thief and the monster flick The Wolfman which finished the three-day race just $473,000 apart. Powered by these three big hits, the Top 20 surged to $190M, a new all-time high for this holiday.Moviegoers looking for love lifted the star-studded ensemble comedy Valentine’s Day to number one with an astonishing estimate of $52.4M resulting in the third largest opening ever in the month of February. Warner Bros. launched the PG-13 film ultrawide in 3,665 theaters and averaged a sensational $14,300. Very few live-action comedies have ever debuted north of $50M making Day‘s performance remarkable. Those that have included star vehicles (Bruce Almighty‘s $68M), sequels (Austin Powers in Goldmember‘s $76.6M) and franchise pics (Sex and the City‘s $56.8M).[rtimage]MapID=1219218&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=51&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Critics panned Valentine’s Day giving it some of the worst reviews of the year so far, but audiences paid no attention and responded to the abundance of stars (Julia Roberts, Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Alba, Jennifer Garner, Jamie Foxx, Bradley Cooper, Anne Hathaway, Queen Latifah, Taylor Lautner, Taylor Swift among others), a strong marketing push, and the timely release over Valentine’s Day weekend. The date pic charmed another $30.4M from overseas audiences in 52 markets for a $83M global gross.There was a close battle for second place but initial studio estimates put Fox’s Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians in the runnerup spot by a slim margin with an estimated $31.1M in its first weekend. The PG-rated fantasy adventure averaged a solid $9,267 from 3,356 locations. Reviews were mixed, but the best among the three new wide openers. With schools out on Monday, Percy aims to widen the lead over the four-day stretch.[rtimage]MapID=1214096&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Universal debuted its monster movie The Wolfman in third with an estimated $30.6M from 3,222 sites for a muscular $9,506 average. Produced by and starring Benicio Del Toro, the R-rated chiller played more to fans of horror and thrillers and stood out from the weekend’s other offerings. Reviews were mostly bad. Overseas, it scared up $21M from 37 markets for a worldwide bite of $52M.Together the three new releases grossed a staggering $114M over three days and will likely boost that tally to about $135M over the Friday-to-Monday long weekend. That’s almost twice the $72.1M that last year’s trio of new films collected over the same four-day holiday. In 2008, four films launched over the Presidents’ Day frame grossing $90.4M over four days.[rtimage]MapID=1194949&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Avatar dropped down to fourth place but only lost 4% of its weekend gross taking in an estimated $22M propelling the record cume to $659.6M. The Fox overachiever should shatter the $700M mark before March arrives. Internationally, James Cameron was still on top with another $59M boosting the overseas haul to $1.69 billion and the worldwide tally to an eye-popping $2.35 billion.The hit tearjerker Dear John fell 50% from its solid opening and grossed an estimated $15.3M pushing the ten-day tally to $53.2M. The Sony release could end up with an impressive $80-90M. Dwayne Johnson’s durable kidpic The Tooth Fairy followed with an estimated $5.6M, off just 16%, for a cume of $41.5M in 24 days for Fox.[rtimage]MapID=1220192&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]John Travolta and Mel Gibson followed with their latest action offerings. From Paris With Love grossed an estimated $4.7M, down 42%, for a $15.9M sum for Lionsgate. A final of around $25M is likely. Edge of Darkness dropped just 33% to an estimated $4.6M giving Warner Bros. $36.1M to date.Fox Searchlight added 186 runs to its Oscar contender Crazy Heart and enjoyed a 12% bump up to $4M, according to estimates. The Jeff Bridges pic has collected $16.5M thus far. Rounding out the top ten was Oscar winner Denzel Washington’s latest effort The Book of Eli which grossed an estimated $3.3M, off 31%, for a $87.2M total.[rtimage]MapID=1200453&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In limited release, Fox Searchlight’s My Name is Khan opened to an estimated $1.9M from 120 theaters setting a new record for the largest opening ever for a Hindi-language film in North America. The PG-13 film starring Shah Rukh Khan topped all films in release this weekend with a $15,500 per-theater average. [Full disclosure: This writer was a consultant on the release of this film.]The top ten films grossed an estimated $173.6M which was up 14% from the Friday-to-Sunday portion of last year’s holiday frame when Friday the 13th opened in the top spot with $40.6M; and up a massive 56% from 2008’s holiday when Jumper debuted at number one with $27.4M.Author: Gitseh Pandya, Box Office Guru.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"period, IFC, boxing, song, Horse, Returns, Musical, show, razzies, Christmas, Office, Year, Bowl, of, the","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Big-Love-for-Valentines-Day"},{"id":"47509136869281","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avatar Finally Toppled by Dear John","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avatar Finally Toppled by Dear JohnThe \"chick flick\" steals the #1 spot from James Cameron's reigning 7-week champby Gitesh Pandya | February 7, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend in a surprise upset victory, the new romance saga Dear John booted seven-time champ Avatar from the number one spot at the North American box office powered by young women chasing after Hollywood hunk Channing Tatum. John Travolta (the Tatum of the late 1970s) saw his new action thriller From Paris With Love bomb settling for third place. Overall ticket sales slipped from last weekend thanks in part to the Super Bowl distracting millions of Americans.The young ladies couldn’t resist a man in uniform as the soldier story Dear John surged past industry expectations to capture the top slot at the multiplexes with an estimated $32.4M opening weekend. Invading 2,969 theaters, the PG-13 drama starring Tatum and Amanda Seyfried averaged a muscular $10,913 per site. Eager to take credit for the remarkable performance were Relativity Media which produced and Sony’s Screen Gems unit which handled marketing and distribution duties. It was the biggest opening ever over Super Bowl weekend beating the $31.1M of the Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus 3D concert film from two years ago which played in just 683 locations but charged $15 per ticket for a scorching $45,561 average.[rtimage]MapID=1220192&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With Hollywood too busy in recent weeks rolling out underperforming films from over-50 actors like Travolta, Mel Gibson, and Harrison Ford, neglected teen girls found in Dear John the exact type of entertainment they were looking to pay top dollar for. According to Sony’s research, a whopping 84% of the audience was female while 64% was under 21. The $25M film opened better than From Paris With Love, Edge of Darkness, and Extraordinary Measures – combined. John even powered ahead of the $27.8M debut of the star-studded book-based date flick He’s Just Not That Into You from exactly one year ago.Reviews were mostly bad so the studio instead took its case directly to the customers scheduling many word-of-mouth screenings to build buzz and promoting the film with the U.S. Army and other military organizations. The lead actors were also sent to strategic locations for public appearances where, conveniently, teenage girls went into screaming frenzies. Dear John benefited from a release date just a week before Valentine’s Day and had a built-in audience of readers of the Nicholas Sparks book. 2004’s The Notebook, also based on one of his novels, turned into a major sleeper hit that summer. His next book-turned-movie The Last Song stars Miley Cyrus and hits cinemas at the end of next month over Easter weekend opposite the 3D actioner Clash of the Titans.[rtimage]MapID=1220192&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After its seven-week reign at the top of the box office, James Cameron’s Oscar-nominated juggernaut Avatar slipped to second place but still generated a healthy $23.6M, according to estimates. Off 25%, the Fox smash boosted its domestic haul to $630.1M. It was only the second time in its entire run that the weekend decline was more than 20%, however much of that was due to the expected hit Sunday will take because of the Super Bowl. Compared to last weekend, Friday slipped by 19%, Saturday dipped by 18%, and Sunday is projected to fall by 39%. For this weekend, the studio is forecasting a rather low 48% drop from Saturday to Sunday. Most distributors are factoring in declines of over 60% because of the Big Game.Overseas, Avatar grossed an estimated $75M this weekend, down 21%, lifting the record international tally to $1.58 billion and the global tally to an eye-popping $2.21 billion. Reaching $2.5 billion should be easy for the 3D extravaganza.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Action fans showed little interest in John Travolta’s bald head and goatee as the actor’s latest offering From Paris With Love bowed in third place with an estimated $8.1M from 2,722 theaters for a weak $2,983 average. The R-rated espionage thriller was directed by Pierre Morel whose hit thriller Taken was the big surprise winner over last year’s Super Bowl frame. This time, moviegoers were not excited and mostly avoided the French-set action flick. Reviews were negative for the Lionsgate release.Audiences abandoned Mel Gibson as his revenge thriller Edge of Darkness tumbled by 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $7M. After ten days, the Warner Bros. release has collected $29.1M and is headed for a finish of roughly $45M. On the other hand, Dwayne Johnson’s kidpic The Tooth Fairy posted another good hold in its third round dropping 35% to an estimated $6.5M. Fox’s 17-day total stands at $34.3M.[rtimage]MapID=1202110&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Falling a steep 55% in its second weekend was the romantic comedy When in Rome which grossed an estimated $5.5M putting the ten-day sum at a decent $20.9M for Buena Vista. Following in seventh was The Book of Eli with an estimated $4.8M, off 46%, giving Warner Bros. $82.2M to date.Fox Searchlight expanded its Oscar contender Crazy Heart from 239 to 819 theaters and saw ticket sales climb 58% to an estimated $3.7M for an eighth place finish. Averaging $4,457 per site, the Jeff Bridges starrer scored three nods for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Song. The film has already earned many wins in the actor and song categories of other awards groups. Cume is now $11.2M.[rtimage]MapID=1200453&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Sony’s supernatural thriller Legion tumbled 53% to an estimated $3.4M lifting its cume to $34.7M. Sherlock Holmes rounded out the top ten and broke the double century mark in the process. The Robert Downey Jr. pic fell 42% to an estimated $2.6M raising the total to $201.6M. It became the record tenth release of 2009 to jump the $200M mark. With $242.5M from overseas markets, the global tally for the Guy Ritchie-directed franchise-starter now stands at an impressive $444M.Oscar nominees for Best Picture that are still in theaters benefited from the higher profile. Witnessing smaller declines than before were The Blind Side which dipped 14% to an estimated $2.6M and Up in the Air which slipped 16% to an estimated $2.4M. Totals are $241.6M and $76.7M, respectively. Lionsgate’s Precious expanded from 222 to 669 locations but still struggled with audiences. Despite more than doubling its weekend gross, the urban drama took in an estimated $435,000 averaging only $650 per site. Total is $46M.[rtimage]MapID=1208108&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $97.6M which was up 2% from last year’s Super Bowl frame when Taken opened in the top spot with $24.7M; and up 3% from 2008’s football weekend when Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds 3D debuted at number one with $31.1M.

Three new films without 3D trips into outer space opened to mixed results with the thriller Legion leading the way in second place with a solid showing. The family comedy The Tooth Fairy saw mild business in fourth while moviegoers ignored the drama Extraordinary Measures which landed in seventh. Films with major Golden Globe wins all witnessed small declines.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=31&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]There was no stopping Avatar which slipped a remarkably low 16% in its sixth frame and grossed an estimated $36M to remain atop the North American box office. After only 38 days of release, the Fox smash catapulted its total domestic gross to an eye-popping $552.8M and on Saturday surpassed The Dark Knight to seize the number two spot on the list of top-grossing domestic blockbusters of all-time. It now trails Titanic‘s $600.8M by a mere $48M and will break the 12-year-old record next week with ease. Avatar also set a new record for best gross in the sixth weekend of any film’s release beating the iceberg pic’s $25.2M from this very frame in 1998. The Pandora hit has grossed north of $35M in each of its six weekends – another industry first.In the world of actual tickets sold, Avatar trails numerous films from the past like 1990’s Home Alone, 1994’s Forrest Gump, and 2002’s Spider-Man. But in the world of grosses – the actual dollar amounts that participating production, distribution, and exhibition companies will be dividing up and stuffing their pockets with – the Na’vi hit is now in the same league that Titanic‘s strength has been powered in part by Saturday surges. The Golden Globe winner for Best Picture – Drama took in $9.1M on Friday, soared by 81% to $16.5M on Saturday, and is estimated to dip 37% to $10.4M on Sunday. 3D and IMAX screens are also at the center of the public fascination with the film as people are continuing to pay extra for this next-generation moviegoing experience. At Avatar‘s current pace, reaching the $700M domestic barrier cannot be ruled out.The Cameron megahit is still a durable smash overseas as international audiences have not had enough. The overseas tally hit an estimated $107M this weekend, off a slim 14%, boosting the international haul to a staggering $1.288 billion beating Titanic‘s record of $1.242 billion. The global gross now stands at a jaw-dropping $1.841 billion for Avatar putting it a mere $2M behind the long-standing record of $1.843 billion set in 1998. Avatar will have no problem crashing through the $2 billion worldwide mark in the coming weeks as it topples all of Titanic’s major box office records.[rtimage]MapID=1216680&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In the weekly battle to be the top non-Avatar film, Sony scored a hit with its supernatural thriller Legion which debuted to an estimated $18.2M from 2,476 theaters for a strong $7,351 average. The R-rated effects film starring Paul Bettany, Tyrese Gibson, and Dennis Quaid played to young men done with Pandora. Studio research showed that 58% of the audience was male and 54% was over 25. Legion cost $25-30M to produce.Denzel Washington’s apocalyptic thriller The Book of Eli dropped a moderate 48% to an estimated $17M and placed third this weekend. After ten days, the R-rated actioner has taken in a solid $62M for Warner Bros. and has a chance at becoming the Oscar-winning actor’s fourth career $100M+ hit.[rtimage]MapID=1202110&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Rock generated mild results for his latest entry into the family film market The Tooth Fairy which bowed to an estimated $14.5M from 3,344 sites for a mediocre $4,336 average. Dwayne Johnson’s PG-rated tale of a hockey superstar that becomes, yes, a tooth fairy played mostly to kids and parents. Reviews were bad, but probably had little impact.Off 48% in its second weekend of wide play, Peter Jackson’s The Lovely Bones dropped to fifth with an estimated $8.8M lifting the total to $31.6M. Paramount might end up with around $50M which didn’t seem possible just two weeks ago. Sherlock Holmes held strong easing only 28% to an estimated $7.1M in its fifth frame. The Warner Bros. hit has banked $191.6M and next week will become the tenth film from 2009 to break the $200M hurdle.[rtimage]MapID=1220547&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford failed to excite adult audiences with their new drama Extraordinary Measures which opened in seventh with only $7M, according to estimates. The first release from CBS Films averaged a weak $2,746 from 2,549 locations and played best in the midwest, southeast and mountain areas. The PG-rated film drew poor reviews which had an impact on the older-skewing audience.[rtimage]MapID=1209288&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With Fox’s own Tooth Fairy taking away kids looking for goofy comedy, the studio’s smash Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel fell 44% to an estimated $6.5M for eighth place. But the runaway hit did break the double century mark this weekend pushing its total to $204.2M.Universal’s adult comedy It’s Complicated still held up well dipping only 24% in its fifth round to an estimated $6.2M boosting the total to $98.7M. Look for the Meryl Streep pic to break the $100M mark by the end of the week. Jackie Chan rounded out the top ten with his kidpic The Spy Next Door which fell a troubling 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $4.8M. Lionsgate has grossed only $18.7M in ten days and should finish with $27-29M. Chan will try to attract a larger audience this summer when he stars in the China-set remake of The Karate Kid opposite Will Smith’s son Jaden.The top ten films grossed $126.1M which was up 6% from last year when Paul Blart: Mall Cop opened in the top spot with $21.6M; and up 16% from 2007 when Meet the Spartans debuted at number one with $18.5M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"adventure, show","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Avatar-Takes-Sixth-Consecutive-Weekend"},{"id":"47509136874403","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avatar Continues To Dominate","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avatar Continues To DominateThe Book of Eli and The Lovely Bones round out the top three.by Sujit Chawla | January 17, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, or a fifth straight weekend James Cameron’s Avatar controlled the box office setting another milestone as it moved past Star Wars into third place on the all-time domestic box office chart. Watch out The Dark Knight, you’re next.The unstoppable force that is Avatar dropped a slim 18% from last weekend and brought in another $41.3, according to estimates, bringing its total to an other-worldly $491.7M. Internationally, the film has now made $1.1B, which is just a hop, skip and a jump from Titanic‘s current record of $1.2B. Combined, the 3D sci-fi adventure flick has made an astounding $1.6B worldwide in only five weeks and the only question now is when it’ll beat Titanic, not if.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Book of Eli gave it a valiant effort, but fell short this weekend, taking in $31.6M according to estimates. That’s good enough to give Denzel Washington his second biggest opening weekend ever, behind only 2007’s American Gangster which shot up $43M in its opening weekend on its way to a final gross of $130M. The Book of Eli averaged a very strong $10,162 this weekend which could portend good things for the future.Rising up to third place this weekend after a nationwide rollout was Peter Jackson’s The Lovely Bones. The movie version of the bestselling novel brought in $17M, according to estimates, for an above average per screen take of $6,656. Reviews had been mixed for the dark tale of a murdered girl who narrates her life from the beyond, but apparently there were enough fans of the book that wanted to see the film regardless of the reviews.[rtimage]MapID=1189344&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=40&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A couple of holdovers rounded out the top five this weekend, flipflopping positions from the last few weeks. Fourth place went to the squeaky Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel which sang to the tune of $11.5M this weekend, according to estimates, down only 30% from last weekend. Its total now stands at $192.6M, which is just a stone’s throw from the original’s $217.3M final total. Fifth place went to the dashing duo Holmes and Watson as Sherlock Holmes brought in another $9.8M, according to estimates, down 41% from last weekend, bringing its cume to $180M.Debuting softly in sixth place was Jackie Chan in The Spy Next Door. The spy-turned-babysitter film took in $9.7M this weekend, according to estimates, for a per screen average of only $3,317. Apparently families have not had their fill of singing rodents leaving Mr. Chan and his brood out in the cold.[rtimage]MapID=1220593&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Universal took the next two spots on the chart with It’s Complicated and Leap Year. Complicated took in $7.6M in its fourth weekend of release, according to estimates, bringing its total to $88.2M and a shot at the $100M mark definitely within reach. On the opposite end of the spectrum was Leap Year, starring Amy Adams, which fell a reasonable 36.7% from last weekend to an estimated $5.8M. Its total stands at $17.5M and should end its run with around $35M.In ninth place was the surprise hit of the season, The Blind Side which just keeps rolling along, this time taking in $5.6M, according to estimates, bringing its total to a tremendous $226.7M. And in tenth place was George Clooney’s award-bait Up in the Air which fell 23.7% from last weekend to $5.4M, according to estimates. The total now stands at $62.8M with a lot more to come if it can win a few major awards in the next few weeks.[rtimage]MapID=1212694&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=27&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A couple of last weekend’s debuts dropped heavily in their sophomore frame as Daybreakers fell 67% to an estimated $5M and Youth in Revolt fell 59% to an estimated $2.8M.

The silver and bronze once again went to Sherlock Holmes and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel while the vampire pic Daybreakers led the new films with a decent fourth place debut. Avatar, meanwhile, showed enough strength around the world that it has now put Titanic‘s all-time records in jeopardy.Tripling its nearest competitor’s grosses, Fox’s Avatar enjoyed yet another remarkable frame on top taking in an estimated $48.5M as the 24-day cume skyrocketed to an unbelievable $429M. Its 29% decline was the smallest of any film in wide release proving that the 3D adventure is still pulling in moviegoers even after the close of the busy holiday season. In its fourth round, Avatar is still averaging a muscular $14,173 per theater. Generating sizable grosses during the holidays is common, but to remain this strong in January is uncommon.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The decline is especially impressive since Friday last weekend was the New Year’s holiday which boosted business for all films. Compared to last weekend’s daily numbers, Friday this weekend fell by 48% but Saturday slipped by only 18% while Sunday is estimated to dip by just 20%. Saturday’s $21.3M was incredibly strong this weekend as the 60% increase from Friday’s $13.3M was tops among all non-kiddie movies. In fact, Saturday was bigger than the entire weekend grosses for any other film. Titanic and Star Wars Episode I also enjoyed supercharged Saturday grosses during their leggy runs. Avatar‘s performance is outstanding given that it is a male-skewing action film competing against the start of the NFL playoffs which featured games on both Saturday and Sunday this weekend.Avatar‘s three-day tally was easily the biggest gross ever for any film in its fourth weekend of release beating the old $28.7M record from 2,746 sites of Titanic from this very same frame twelve years ago. At today’s ticket prices, that would amount to $45M and it wasn’t in 3D meaning the two films sold about the same amount of tickets at this stage of the release. The 3D adventure’s third and fourth weekends now rank as January’s two biggest weekend grosses ever. The month’s biggest opening frame is $40.1M by 2008’s Cloverfield. No other films, debuting or holdover, have ever broken $40M in a January session.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=31&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Avatar smashed the $400M mark on Saturday in just 23 days making it the second fastest movie in history behind The Dark Knight which only needed 18 days in 2008. After 24 days, the Pandora film is running a mere 3% behind the pace of the Joker flick which had amassed $441.6M at this same point in its run. By this coming Saturday, Avatar should surpass the pace of Knight and eventually finish ahead of that film’s monster $533.3M cume.On the all-time domestic blockbusters list, Avatar surged to number seven between the $431.1M of 1999’s Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and the $423.3M of 2006’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest. By Tuesday it will rise to number four passing Shrek 2 and E.T. Admissions, of course, are another story. Should Avatar continue on a course that sees moderate 35% weekly declines, it would be able to reach at least $581M domestically while a more durable run could see it break Titanic‘s $600.8M benchmark.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=21&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Defying gravity, Avatar actually saw international sales rise this weekend by 5% to an estimated $143M helped in part by a record-breaking opening week in China. That shot the overseas total to a mind-boggling $906.2M boosting the worldwide tally to $1.3352 billion. A whopping 68% of sales are coming from the offshore markets and that ratio should climb as the film’s strong domestic legs are overshadowed by phenomenal staying power internationally. Overseas business accounted for 75% of this weekend’s $191.5M global take. Avatar now looks very likely to break Titanic‘s long-standing $1.8 billion record to become the number one global blockbuster of all-time.Not having the same legs at the box office was Sherlock Holmes which tumbled 55% in the third weekend suffering a sharp fall now that the holiday season is gone. Still, the Warner Bros. franchise hopeful did remain the biggest non-Na’vi film in the land for the third straight frame and has bumped its 17-day total to an impressive $165.2M. Breaking the $200M mark is still a possibility.[rtimage]MapID=10010659&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=48&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Also falling sharply was Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel which stayed put in third with an estimated $16.3M dropping 54%. Fox has banked $178.2M with its franchise pic and is still on course to fly past the $200M mark just like its predecessor. Together, the two Chipmunks films should total over $430M just from North America.Lionsgate enjoyed a decent debut for its vampire thriller Daybreakers which landed in fourth place with an estimated $15M from 2,523 locations. The R-rated horror entry averaged a solid $5,945 and even drew good reviews from critics which is rare for this genre. Ticket sales dipped 5% on Saturday after the opening day so the usual rapid erosion is likely.Universal followed with a pair of chick flicks anchored by the stars of last summer’s Julie &amp; Julia. The Nancy Meyers film It’s Complicated starring Meryl Streep fell 42% to an estimated $11M in its third session boosting the 17-day total to $76.4M. Debuting in sixth place was the Amy Adams engagement comedy Leap Year which didn’t fare that well with audiences with an estimated $9.2M bow from 2,511 locations. Averaging only $3,650 per site, the PG-rated film skewed heavily towards women with females making up 79% of the audience and 54% being 30 or older. Reviews were horrendous. It did not come close to the $19.8M of last year’s Bride Wars or the $23M of 27 Dresses – both January comedies aimed at young women.[rtimage]MapID=10011994&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In its eighth weekend, Sandra Bullock’s The Blind Side finally dropped below the $10M mark grossing an estimated $7.8M for seventh place. The sleeper smash slipped only 35% and upped its amazing cume to $219.2M. Paramount’s awards contender Up in the Air followed with an estimated $7.1M, off just 34%, for a $54.7M total.The Weinstein Co. saw a weak opening for its teen comedyYouth in Revolt which debuted down in ninth place with an estimated $7M from 1,873 sites for a mild $3,737 average. The R-rated Michael Cera pic attracted favorable reviews but its target audience of young adults had bigger films in the marketplace to take away their attention.[rtimage]MapID=1200671&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Rounding out the top ten was Disney’s The Princess and the Frog with an estimated $4.7M in its seventh round, down a steep 52%, pushing the cume to $92.6M.The top ten films grossed $143.2M which was up 18% from last year when Gran Torino opened wide in the top spot with $29.5M; and up a healthy 45% from 2007 when The Bucket List debuted at number one with $19.4M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Teen, The, Valentine's, American, Islander","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Avatar-Is-Still-1"},{"id":"47509136893868","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: 2012 Destroys the Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: 2012 Destroys the CompetitionPlus, A Christmas Carol gets #2, and Pirate Radio capsizes.by Gitesh Pandya | November 15, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend Audiences were warned – by Mayans and film critics alike – but moviegoers around the world still flooded the multiplexes to see Roland Emmerich’s latest disaster epic 2012 which generated an explosive global debut. Last weekend’s top film A Christmas Carol held up well in its second weekend taking the runner-up spot while the awards hopeful Precious expanded moderately but raced all the way up to number four despite playing in fewer than 200 theaters. Overall ticket sales were slightly behind last year’s levels, but well ahead of 2007.Blasting past expectations, Sony scored its best opening of 2009 with 2012 which grossed an estimated $65M this weekend from North America alone. As big as it was, that amount represented just 29% of the global haul which soared to $225M thanks to a stunning $160M from 105 international territories. The doomsday thriller cost at least $200M to produce and was backed with an expensive worldwide marketing push which paid off.[rtimage]MapID=1205696&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The PG-13 pic opened domestically in 3,404 theaters and averaged a sensational $19,095. Sony estimated that opening weekend sales hit $23.6M on Friday, inched up 5% to $24.8M on Saturday, and will drop by a slim 33% to $16.6M on Sunday. If the estimate holds, 2012 will have the seventh largest November debut ever. The disaster pic played to a broad audience as studio research showed that males made up 52% of the crowd and 55% were 25 or older. Critics slammed the movie with negative reviews taking major aim at its script.Overseas, 2012 delivered the fifth largest international opening of all-time and the largest ever for a non-sequel. Emmerich’s previous disaster films have played especially well around the world so his newest one was always expected to be a global performer. Even with large declines in the weeks ahead, the worldwide gross may soar north of $500M by the end of its run.[rtimage]MapID=1205696&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After a soft opening at number one last weekend, Disney’s 3D holiday offering A Christmas Carol displayed good legs dipping only 26% in its sophomore outing to an estimated $22.3M. The expensive Jim Carrey vehicle has taken in $63.3M in ten days and is playing out like the studio’s 2002 holiday pic The Santa Clause 2 which also was released on the first weekend of November. Carol and Clause had similar openings of $30.1M and $29M, respectively, and the Tim Allen sequel bagged another $24.7M in its second weekend pushing its ten-day score to $60M. The only major difference was the drop as Clause 2 eased by just 15%. The latest motion capture project from Robert Zemeckis could finish up with around $130M depending on how it holds up over the lucrative Thanksgiving session.George Clooney’s The Men Who Stare At Goats fell 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $6.2M but remained in third place with a cume of $23.4M in ten days. Overture may find its way to $35-40M by the end of its run.[rtimage]MapID=1217605&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=29&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A hair behind in fourth place was Lionsgate’s awards contender Precious which rocketed up the charts thanks to an expansion from 18 to 174 locations delivering an estimated $6.1M gross for the weekend and a dazzling $35,000 average per theater. Reaching the top ten usually requires at least 1,000 theaters, but to hit the top five with under 200 venues is virtually unheard of. Backed by promotional clout from executive producers Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, the R-rated tale of an abused pregnant teen from Harlem continued to show remarkable strength proving it wasn’t just some one-week wonder. Precious opened in new markets such as San Francisco, Houston, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. plus expanded into more theaters in its initial markets of New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Chicago.Cume is $8.9M which is just the tip of the iceberg as the well-reviewed film will expand nationally this month plus it has awards season ahead of it when nominations and wins could keep it going all the way to March 7 when Oscars are handed out. This Friday, Lionsgate will widen Precious into roughly 600 theaters across more than 100 markets throughout North America and will add more playdates for Thanksgiving.[rtimage]MapID=1208108&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Michael Jackson’s This Is It stumbled in its third round falling 61% to an estimated $5.1M boosting the 19-day take to $67.2M. Sony continued to see bigger numbers overseas as the international take for the weekend was $11.5M. The collection of concert rehearsal footage has now grossed $155.4M overseas and a stellar $222.6M worldwide. A whopping 70% of the tally to date has come from outside of North America.Universal’s alien abduction chiller The Fourth Kind took a tumble in its second frame falling 61% to an estimated $4.7M lifting the ten-day tally to $20.6M. A $27-29M final seems likely. The studio has fared much better with its relationship comedy Couples Retreat which broke the $100M mark in its sixth weekend grossing an estimated $4.3M. Down just 31%, the Vince Vaughn vehicle has displayed great legs this fall and has upped its cume to $102.1M giving the actor his seventh hit to join the century club. The former swinger has also headlined $100M+ grossers in five of the last six years.[rtimage]MapID=1209302&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Also breaking nine digits was the indie thriller Paranormal Activity which scared up an estimated $4.2M, off 49%, for a $103.8M sum for Paramount. Overture’s top-grossing film ever Law Abiding Citizen followed by dipping 35% to an estimated $3.9M for a $67.3M total. The Cameron Diaz flop The Box rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.2M, down a sharp 58%, raising the cume to a measly $13.2M after ten days. Look for a $17-19M final for Warner Bros.The British pic Pirate Radio was lost at sea and failed to find its way into the top ten during its opening weekend. Focus bowed the Philip Seymour Hoffman film in 882 locations and attracted just $2.9M worth of business, according to estimates, averaging a poor $3,253. Mixed reviews and a lack of starpower hurt the 1966-set tale of rebel radio DJs.[rtimage]MapID=10011834&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]But Fox enjoyed spectacular results for its stop-motion animated film from director Wes Anderson, Fantastic Mr. Fox, which debuted in only four theaters but grossed an estimated $260,000 for a stunning $65,000 average. That was similar to the $67,469 average of the filmmaker’s last entry The Darjeeling Limited although that one opened on a Saturday so its figures were for two days instead of three. The PG-rated Fox, which features the voices of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, and Bill Murray, will expand into more than 2,000 theaters on Wednesday, November 25 for the Thanksgiving frame. The studio is hoping that loyal Anderson fans in New York and Los Angeles will help spread the word allowing it to find broad appeal by the long holiday session.The top ten films grossed an estimated $125M which was down 7% from last year when Quantum of Solace opened in the top spot with $67.5M; but up a healthy 38% from 2007 when Beowulf debuted at number one with $27.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"renewals, Adult, Marvel, cartoon, Watching, Rock, live","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-2012-Destroys-the-Competition"},{"id":"47509138515900","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mission Accomplished For G-Force","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mission Accomplished For G-ForceHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Ugly Truth round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | July 26, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend audiences shifted their attention from teen wizards to talking guinea pigs as Disney’s 3D action film G-Force pulled an upset at the North American box office knocking Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince out of the top spot in its second weekend. The Hogwarts flick fell sharply but still pulled in a solid gross and continued its sensational run around the world. Mature audiences came out in impressive numbers for the Katherine Heigl-Gerard Butler comedy The Ugly Truth which opened well in third place.Families rushed to multiplexes to see adorable talking animals as G-Force powered its way to the top spot with an estimated $32.2M from an ultrawide release in 3,697 theaters. Averaging a healthy $8,697 per theater, the PG-rated action-adventure about guinea pig government spies connected with family audiences and took advantage of higher-priced tickets from its 1,600 3D locations. With almost $500M spent this summer on 3D toons Up and Ice Age, kids and parents were ready to move on to a live-action film that still offered clean and fun entertainment for children of all ages. The Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer brand names also added some weight.[rtimage]MapID=10009462&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]G-Force continued the studio’s great summer following Up and The Proposal which also debuted at number one. The trio could end up grossing a powerful $550M or more combined.Dropping to second place was the film most expected to top the charts, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which grossed an estimated $30M in its second weekend. The wizard sequel fell a steep 62% which was completely expected given the last film’s 58% sophomore drop. After 12 days, the newest Potter has banked an impressive $221.8M putting it 7% ahead of the pace of 2007’s Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which stood at $207.9M at the same point in its run. Factoring in ticket price increases, the two films have sold an identical amount of tickets over their first 12 days, although Prince did it with virtually no IMAX sales. Phoenix grossed a slightly better $32.5M in its second frame.With the bulk of its IMAX run to start this Wednesday, Half-Blood Prince could be on its way to a domestic total of $300M or a bit more. Overseas, the new Hogwarts tale fell sharply but still led the international box office with a muscular $84.4M from over 16,000 screens in 64 markets boosting the overseas total to an eye-popping $405.3M and the worldwide tally to a stunning $627.1M. The dazzling performance this weekend led to two major milestones — Warner Bros. smashed the $1 billion mark in overseas box office for 2009 and the Harry Potter franchise shattered the $5 billion mark across its six films in eight years. The series has grossed $5.1 billion and counting and should reach at least $5.4 billion with two more installments still to come.[rtimage]MapID=1189302&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Sony targeted the date crowd and scored an impressive opening for its romantic comedy The Ugly Truth which bowed in the third slot with an estimated $27M from 2,882 theaters. The R-rated pic averaged a strong $9,368 which was tops among films in the top ten. It also underscored the growing box office clout of Katherine Heigl who enjoyed a $23M debut last year anchoring the comedy 27 Dresses. Studio research showed that 62% of the audience was female while 64% was over 25. Adult women and couples have had no new films specifically for them over the past month as most movies have targeted kids, teens, or the action crowd. The lack of competition helped the $38M production overcome horrible reviews from critics and last week’s sneak previews helped to spread advance buzz.The new horror title Orphan performed moderately in its debut grossing an estimated $12.8M from 2,750 locations this weekend. Bowing in fourth place with a decent $4,644 average, the R-rated thriller about a creepy girl adopted by unsuspecting parents performed much like past fright flicks like One Missed Call and The Eye which opened to $12.4M and $12.5M, respectively.[rtimage]MapID=1207460&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fox’s hit toon Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs lost audiences and 3D screens to the guinea pigs this weekend and suffered its worst decline yet falling 53% to an estimated $8.2M. With a solid $171.3M in the bank, a final gross close to the $195.3M of Ice Age: The Meltdown and $197.8M of this spring’s 3D flick Monsters vs. Aliens still seems likely. Overseas, Dawn shattered the half-billion mark with an estimated $40.6M this weekend from 102 markets for an international cume of $505.4M and a dizzying global tally of $676.7M.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen fell out of the top five in its fifth weekend, but it did climb into the All-Time Top 10 list. The robot sequel scored an estimated $8M, down 42%, boosting the total to $379.1M after 33 days of release. That puts Michael Bay’s critically-panned testosterone flick at number 10 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters bumping off Oscar champ The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King which took in $377M in 2003 and 2004. The Peter Jackson adventure sold more tickets though since ticket prices have increased since then. Reaching $400M should not be a problem for em&gt;Transformers which will end up selling about as many tickets as 1997’s Men in Black, another summer sci-fi smash executive produced by Steven Spielberg.[rtimage]MapID=1188000&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A week away from joining the All-Time Top 50, The Hangover enjoyed yet another solid frame grossing an estimated $6.5M, off just 21%, giving Warner Bros. a $247.1M total. A hair behind in eighth place was another successful summer comedy The Proposal which slipped only 23% to an estimated $6.4M for a $140.1M cume. This is the sixth straight weekend that the two comedies were side-by-side on the charts although Sandra Bullock spent the first five times on top.Universal rounded out the top ten with the gangster drama Public Enemies with an estimated $4.2M and the fashionista pic Brüno with an estimated $2.7M. The Johnny Depp vehicle fell 46% raising the sum to $88.1M while the Sacha Baron Cohen pic tumbled 67% for a $56.5M cume.[rtimage]MapID=1200814&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $138M which was down 19% from last year when The Dark Knight stayed in the top spot with $75.2M; and also down 19% from 2007 when The Simpsons Movie debuted at number one with $74M.Author: Gitesh Pandyawww.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"play, President","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Mission-Accomplished-For-GForce"},{"id":"47509138511802","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Support G.I.

Joe to a hugenumber one opening grossing more than the next five films combined by targetingyoung males. Meryl Streep held her own against all the military hardwaregenerating a strong second place showing for her turn as a celebrity chef in Julie &amp; Juliawhich played well to adult women. Entertaining entirely different audiences, thetwo new releases joined forces to help the North American box office break afour-week losing streak as the marketplace beat out last year’s numbers by ahealthy margin.Attacking an ultrawide 4,007 theaters, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobraposted the fourth largest August opening ever taking in an estimated $56.2M thisweekend. The Paramount hit averaged a muscular $14,025. With an additional $44Mfrom foreign bows in numerous territories, the PG-13 film collected $100Mworldwide in its first weekend of play. After its Transformers sequel gotpanned by critics but attracted massive crowds of moviegoers as 2009’s topblockbuster, the studio decided to limit the number of press it would show Joeto ahead of the release. The only films to open bigger in August were TheBourne Ultimatum ($69.3M in 2007), Rush Hour 2 ($67.4M in 2001), andSigns ($60.1M in 2002).Studio research showed that males made up 60% of the crowd while those over andunder 25 were evenly split. Families made up one-third of the audience while 25%of the turnout was Latino. Friday started with a bang with $22.3M in ticketsales. Saturday saw a 18% fall to $18.3M while Sunday is estimated to decline byanother 14% to $15.7M. Produced for a hefty $175M and marketed aggressively tomainstream American moviegoers looking for escapist popcorn fare, G.I. Joeopened as the final major action tentpole of the summer and faced littlecompetition from similar titles.[rtimage]MapID=1193682&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=32&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Adultwomen not interested in mindless violence lined up for the Meryl Streep-AmyAdams pic Julie &amp;Julia which opened to a strong $20.1M, according to estimates. Playingin 2,354 theaters, the PG-13 film averaged a strong $8,539 per location and waseffective counter-programming against the testosterone blast of G.I. Joe.If estimates hold, Julie will give Streep a $20M+ opener in three of thelast four summers with each one programmed against a male-skewing actiontentpole. In 2006, her comedy The Devil Wears Prada debuted to $27.5Mopposite Superman Returns while last summer’s musical Mamma Mia!bowed to $27.8M against the record launch of The Dark Knight. Now 60, Streep hasbecome a potent box office star in her later years.Produced for just $38M, Julie enjoyed a 17% sales bump on Saturday andscored an encouraging A CinemaScore grade making the road ahead look verypromising. Films targeting older women tend to have legs too so a final grossnorth of $80M could result. Studio research from Sony indicated that the filmconnected with its target audience as 67% was female and 64% was 35 or older.Reviews were positive and moviegoers came out to see the Oscar winner play chefJulia Child.[rtimage]MapID=1207146&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=29&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s3D actioner G-Force dropped 44% but remained in third place taking in an estimated$9.8M pushing the cume to a robust $86.1M for the expensive pic.

But with ticket pricesrising by 7% over the last two years, Prince has actually sold slightlyless stubs than Phoenix. A final domestic tally of about $300M still seemslikely. Overseas, the horny teen wizards captured an estimated $22.3M (down 49%)to boost the international total to a stellar $541.8M and the global gross to astaggering $815.6M.[rtimage]MapID=1189302&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=123&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Audiencesabandoned the Adam Sandler-Judd Apatow experimentFunny Peoplewhich collapsed 65% in its second weekend grossing an estimated $7.9M. Fallingfrom first to fifth place, the R-rated dramedy raised its ten-day cume to adisappointing $40.4M and is likely to end its domestic run with a dismal$60-65M. That’s a far cry from Apatow’s previous R-rated summer comedies The40-Year-Old Virgin ($109.2M) and Knocked Up ($148.8M). Funny‘sfailure to please crowds will also put an end to Sandler’s streak of sevenconsecutive years with $100M+ grossers. Budgeted at $75M, the Universal filmwill also struggle overseas.Knocked Up star Katherine Heigl followed in sixth with her date movie hitThe Ugly Truthwhich pulled in an estimated $7M, off 47%. The Sony romantic comedy hascollected a solid $69.1M. With its $38M pricetag, Ugly cost substantiallyless than both Funny People and Brüno and will gross much morewinning the three-way battle of the R-rated July comedies.More bad news for Universal came in seventh place where its suspense thriller A Perfect Getawaygrossed a weak $5.8M, according to estimates, in its opening weekend. TheR-rated fright pic averaged a dismal $2,670 from 2,159 locations.

After two weeksat number 12, Fox Searchlight’s indie hit (500) Days ofSummer expanded nationwide and jumped up into the top ten with anestimated $3.7M as well.

Holdovers and formerchart-toppers Inglourious Basterds and District 9 bothheld up well making it that rare frame when violent R-rated films claimed thetop four spots at the box office. The on-screen carnage drove ticket sales to anall-time high for the weekend before the Labor Day holiday session closing offan exceptionally powerful August box office.Audiences were in the mood to cheat death as The Final Destination scared its way to a strong top spot debut grossingan estimated $28.3M in its first weekend. The fourth installment in thenine-year-old franchise attacked 3,121 theaters and averaged a sturdy $9,079 persite bolstered by higher ticket prices from the 3D screens. Just under 1,700theaters offered the 3D presentation while the remainder screened the 2Dversion. As with most 3D releases, many multiplexes offered both versions somoviegoers could choose between the extra-dimensional fun or the standardversion at the standard price.[rtimage]MapID=1207470&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Itwas by far the largest opening ever for the franchise beating the $19.2M bow ofFinal Destination 3 from February 2006, and the first to reach numberone. However, when factoring in today’s higher ticket prices and the extrasurcharges that 3D venues collected, the new chapter only sold about 5% moretickets. Still, it proved that moviegoers are willing to pay more for 3Dentertainment and that many genres can benefit from the technology. Finalis the fourth 3D film of the year to open atop the charts after kidpics Monsters vs. Aliens, Up, and G-Force. It also beat out the$21.2M debut of January’s 3D horror entry My Bloody Valentine.Also impressive was how well the new Destination did against suchformidable competition. Halloween II took away a good portion of thehorror crowd and Basterds and District also played to some of thesame violence-loving audience. The gruesome foursome combined for a stellar$76.5M which was equal to what the top thirteen films took in during this verysame weekend last year. Budgeted at about $40M, The Final Destinationwill now try to challenge Friday the 13th‘s $65M to become thetop-grossing horror title of 2009. Nine R-rated films have opened at number onethis year including four during the last five weeks.[rtimage]MapID=1207470&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]QuentinTarantino’s war fantasy InglouriousBasterds enjoyed a solid second weekend despite the arrival of two newR-rated gorefests. The World War II saga dropped by 47% to an estimated $20Mputting the ten-day total at a robust $73.8M. The sophomore fall was much morelike the director’s Kill Bill Vol. 1 (44%) than its followup Kill BillVol. 2 (59%). Audiences are liking Basterds and good word-of-mouth ishelping the theatrical run. Budgeted at $70M, a final domestic haul of roughly$125M seems likely. Overseas moviegoers are also turning out in solid numbers asthe film, released by Universal abroad, grossed an estimated $19.4Minternationally this weekend boosting the overseas total to $59.1M. That putsthe global take at $133M and counting. Worldwide grosses should eventuallysurpass $250M.The Weinstein Co. seized third place too with Halloween IIwhich bowed to an estimated $17.4M from 3,025 sites. Generating a respectable$5,754 average, the R-rated terrorfest is the sequel to the 2007 reboot of thethree-decade-old franchise which launched on the same weekend, but with a muchstronger $26.4M over three days. That film bowed in 447 more theaters and hadthe horror audience all to itself as no other fright flick ranked in the Top 20.Both films were helmed by rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie.[rtimage]MapID=1207868&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=05&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Havinganother horror sequel to compete with on opening weekend certainly made thingsmessy for Halloween II. However even with large declines in the weeksahead, it should be a profitable picture given the low production cost of $15M.Audience research showed that 54% of the crowd was under 25 and males andfemales were evenly split. Expect this one to fade fast as Saturday salestumbled 27% from Friday’s opening day tally. Final Destination held upbetter dipping only 6% on Saturday.The cat food-loving aliens of District 9 came infourth place. Sony’s sci-fi hit slipped only 41% to an estimated $10.7M raisingthe cume to an amazing $90.8M after just 17 days. Look for the prawns to smashthe $100M mark next weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1190668&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=20&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Leadingthe films that younger people could buy tickets to was Paramount’s G.I. Joe which rankedfifth with an estimated $8M. Off 35%, the $175M-budgeted action extravaganzalifted its cume to a solid $132.4M. Few thought at the beginning of the summermovie season that Joe would outgun Terminator Salvation but thereal American hero has now surpassed the $125.3M of the non-Arnold cyborgsequel.For the third straight weekend the chick flicks Julie &amp; Juliaand The TimeTraveler’s Wife were chart neighbors, but the former’s great legsallowed it to have the upper hand this time. Sony’s Meryl Streep hit Juliaeased by a slim 16% to an estimated $7.4M with an impressive $71M cooked up sofar. The $100M mark might now be within reach. Wife dropped by 31% to anestimated $6.7M, still a good hold, and has banked $48.2M for Warner Bros.Female audiences not interested in the recent string of ultraviolent releaseshave been getting their end-of-summer entertainment from thispair.[rtimage]MapID=1207146&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=36&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The RobertRodriguez-directed kidpic Shorts collected an estimated $4.9M in its second weekend. Down only24%, the Warner Bros. release has raised its ten-day tally to a disappointing$13.6M and should end with roughly $25M.Bad reviews hurt Oscar winner Ang Lee’s latest film Taking Woodstockwhich debuted poorly in ninth with an estimated $3.7M. The PG-13 film averaged aweak $2,691 from 1,393 locations and failed to spark any nostalgia with babyboomers.Bookending the top ten with 3D movies, Disney took in an estimated $2.8M for itsfamily actioner G-Force which dropped 31% in its sixth mission lifting the total to$111.8M.[rtimage]MapID=10009462&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=27&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Moviegoerscontinued to catch up on the summer’s biggest blockbusters which witnessed smalldeclines this weekend.

Leading the way was the new adventure pic Where the Wild Things Are which bowed at number one followed by an exceptionally strong debut for the action entry Law Abiding Citizen in second. The most impressive performance came in third with the national expansion of the indie thriller Paranormal Activity which delivered the best average of any film. The four new wide releases kicked in a stunning $86M powering the Top 20 to $135M, a new record high for the month.Audiences rushed out to see Where the Wild Things Are making the adaptation of the popular kids book the top film with an estimated $32.5M in ticket sales. Averaging a ferocious $8,693 from 3,735 theaters, the PG-rated pic scored the eighth biggest October opening ever and the third highest for a kidpic during the month trailing only Shark Tale ($47.6M in 2004) and High School Musical 3 ($42M in 2008). It was also the second widest launch during the month after Shark Tale‘s bow in 4,016 locations.[rtimage]MapID=10008827&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=49&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]While the opening weekend was undoubtedly powerful, the long-term outlook is not as clear. Friday began with a potent $12.1M debut but Saturday inched up only 2% to $12.3M. Family-oriented films during the school year typically see large Saturday jumps in sales thanks to the target audience being more available. In recent weeks, Friday-to-Saturday increases on opening weekend for kidpics Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and the Toy Story double feature were 62% and 69%, respectively. Wild Things seems to be playing more to an adult audience appealing to those who read the book as a kid and to hipsters who enjoy director Spike Jonze’s unique style of filmmaking.Jonze took a nine-sentence book, stretched it into a 100-minute movie, and added plenty of new material including names and backstories for all the Wild Things and a deeper look into the home life of the nine-year-old boy at the center of the story. Reviews have been mixed with critics having a wide range of feelings for the film. Warner Bros. invested heavily into the marketing of Wild Things hoping to appeal to the broadest possible audience since the movie is not the typical family film that Hollywood churns out. The $75M production unspooled in 145 IMAX locations which accounted for $3.1M, or nearly 10% of the weekend tally.[rtimage]MapID=10008827&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=45&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Liam Neeson isn’t the only actor from across the pond to hit it big with a revenge thriller this year. Gerard Butler enjoyed a surprisingly potent bow for the action drama Law Abiding Citizen, also starring Jamie Foxx, which grossed an estimated $21.3M from 2,890 theaters for a stellar $7,353 average. The R-rated story of a man that plots a series of assassinations from jail to get back at those responsible for the killings of his wife and daughter played to a broad audience with males slightly outnumbering females. Neeson’s kidnapping thriller Taken was an unlikely blockbuster last winter when it bowed to $24.7M over Super Bowl weekend on its way to a $145M final.Butler and Foxx are certainly no guarantees at the box office. The former’s action pic Gamer opened to just $9.2M last month while the latter’s The Soloist debuted to a weak $9.7M in April. But the actor combo, the appealing storyline, and an aggressive marketing push helped to make it the biggest opening ever in Overture’s short history easily beating the $16.3M of last fall’s cop drama Righteous Kill with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Citizen should have no problem beating Kill‘s $40.1M total to become the distributor’s top grosser too.[rtimage]MapID=1198026&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=36&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Paramount expanded its micro-budgeted horror hit Paranormal Activity nationwide this weekend following three weeks of limited play and saw sales nearly triple to an estimated $20.2M. Freaking out moviegoers in 760 theaters, up from 160 last weekend, the R-rated spookfest averaged a sensational $26,530 per location matching almost to the dollar the $26,528 average of The Blair Witch Project when it went nationwide during the summer of 1999. That indie overachiever shot up to number two on the charts in its third weekend when it expanded from 31 to 1,101 theaters grossing $29.2M.In its first day of wide release on Friday, Paranormal took in $6.7M, then rose 15% to $7.7M on Saturday. The studio is projecting a slim 25% dip on Sunday to $5.8M. The total now stands at $33.7M with another expansion set for this Friday as it goes head-to-head with the opening of the latest installment of the horror industry’s top franchise Saw VI which attacks 3,000 theaters. Still, with the much-talked-about ghost story continuing to add theaters, and Halloween two weeks away, Paranormal Activity has the potential to finish with at least $75M.Continuing to use out-of-the-box marketing tactics to generate excitement (and sales), the studio has launched a contest that will reward the first ten theaters that sell out their midnight shows this Thursday night with a special party. This promotion is just the latest technique that keeps fans involved with the film’s release as it further infiltrates pop culture. To date, the marketing and distribution campaign has been executed with military precision.[rtimage]MapID=10010502&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Last weekend’s top choice Couples Retreat suffered a rocky second outing dropping 48% to an estimated $17.9M despite not having any new comedies enter the marketplace. With a solid $63.3M taken in over ten days, Universal should find its way to a final domestic tally of $100-110M making it only the second film of the year to join the century club for the troubled studio. Fast &amp; Furious grossed $155.1M last spring. Vince Vaughn’s 2006 Universal relationship trouble flick The Break-Up, which like Retreat he also produced, witnessed an identical 48% plunge in its sophomore frame.Sony’s latest horror film The Stepfather had a lukewarm $12.3M debut in fifth place, according to estimates. The PG-13 thriller averaged a decent $4,499 from 2,734 locations and skewed towards young women. Studio research showed that 54% of the audience was female and 55% was under 21 for the $19M production. Sony usually does better with its mid-October fright films. Last year, Quarantine bowed to $14.2M, 30 Days of Night debuted to $16M in 2007, and The Grudge 2 opened to $20.8M in 2006. The added competition from Paranormal Activity made an impact.[rtimage]MapID=1207147&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The animated comedy Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs broke the $100M mark on Thursday in its 28th day of release and added an estimated $8.1M to its total over the weekend. That gave the Sony hit a slender 30% decline and a new total of $108.3M which is remarkable for a fall pic. Meatballs is only the fourth September release of this entire decade to cross the century mark joining Remember the Titans ($115.6M in 2000), Sweet Home Alabama ($127.2M in 2002), and Eagle Eye ($101.4M in 2008).The studio claimed the next spot too with the horror-comedy Zombieland with an estimated $7.8M, down 47%, resulting in a cume of $60.8M. Disney extended the limited run of its double feature Toy Story &amp; Toy Story 2 (3D) beyond its planned two-week period and grossed an estimated $3M in its third round. Tumbling 61%, the dynamic duo raised the sum to $28.6M in 17 days.[rtimage]MapID=1207888&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Rounding out the top ten were Buena Vista’s Surrogates and the Warner Bros. pic The Invention of Lying with an estimated $1.9M each. The Bruce Willis actioner dropped 55% and has grossed $36.3M to date while the Ricky Gervais comedy fell 43% lifting the cume to $15.5M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $126.9M which was up a stunning 59% from last year when Max Payne opened in the top spot with $17.6M; and up a staggering 75% from 2007 when 30 Days of Night debuted at number one with $16M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Purge, Superheroes, period, WGN, book, Awards, CBS, hidden, golden, awards, Tubi","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Audiences-Eat-Up-Wild-Things"},{"id":"47509138508728","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tarantino’s Basterds Take the Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tarantino's Basterds Take the Top SpotPlus, District 9 stays strong, while other openers fall flat.by Gitesh Pandya | August 23, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend Quentin, Brad, and Harvey lit up their stogies following the exceptional opening of their new World War II film Inglourious Basterds which topped the charts and exceeded all industry expectations to lead a robust late-summer session at the box office. The frame’s three other new releases got the cold shoulder from moviegoers but the overall top ten surged ahead of last year and 2007 by more than 25%. Holdovers contributed too as no film in the top ten declined by more than 50%.Scoring his best opening ever in terms of both gross and admissions, Quentin Tarantino was once again on top of the movie world with his newest feature Inglourious Basterds which bowed to a stellar $37.6M, according to estimates. The much-needed hit for The Weinstein Co. averaged a sizzling $11,880 from 3,165 theaters and beat out the filmmaker’s previous career best delivered by 2004’s Kill Bill Vol 2 which the Weinstein brothers released when they were with Miramax. That bridal revenge saga bowed to $25.1M which would be about $30M at today’s prices.[rtimage]MapID=1200615&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=149&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Basterds, an ensemble film that co-stars Brad Pitt as a leader of an American military group out to kill Nazis during the second World War, was the fifth R-rated film to top the charts this summer and along with last weekend’s District 9 gave the marketplace back-to-back $37M+ R openers. Films in the second half of August rarely debut north of $30M.Reviews were generally positive for Tarantino’s newest venture which cost a reported $70M with Universal co-financing. Friday kicked off with $14.4M, Saturday dipped 10% to $12.9M which was not uncommon for this type of film from a popular director, and Sunday is estimated to dip 20% to $10.3M.Tarantino also scored career best debuts around the world in several countries as the Europe-set drama launched in 22 territories through Universal grossing an estimated $27.5M for a glorious global opening of $65.1M. Helped by Pitt’s worldwide appeal and a largely European cast, Basterds bowed at number one in several key markets such as Australia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. A final global theatrical gross of three to four times the production budget could result.[rtimage]MapID=1200615&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=129&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Coming in behind the Nazis were the prawns of District 9. The alien drama enjoyed a solid second weekend, especially for a sci-fi film, by dropping 49% to an estimated $18.9M bumping the ten-day total to an impressive $73.5M to date. By comparison, last year’s buzzworthy documentary-style monster movie Cloverfield tumbled 68% in its sophomore frame. With a relatively low $30M production cost, Sony’s much-talked-about District 9 should find its way to a robust $120M or so from North America alone.The much pricier popcorn flick G.I. Joe, still the widest film in release by far, declined by 44% and collected an estimated $12.5M in its third mission. Averaging $3,162 from an ultrawide 3,953 locations, the Paramount release has advanced its 17-day total to a solid $120.5M and still seems likely to break the $150M level.[rtimage]MapID=1193682&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=30&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A pair of female-skewing films with different trajectories followed. The romantic drama The Time Traveler’s Wife fell a moderate 46% in its second weekend to an estimated $10M boosting the ten-day total to $37.4M. The cooking comedy Julie &amp; Julia enjoyed better legs dipping only 25% in its third outing to an estimated $9M. Sony has banked an impressive $59.3M to date.While Quentin was enjoying his best debut ever, his good buddy Robert Rodriguez suffered his worst opening ever for a wide release as family audiences ignored his new film Shorts which debuted to an estimated $6.6M. Ranking sixth, the Warner Bros. release averaged a weak $2,126 from a very wide 3,105 theaters. The performance did not come close to the openings of previous kidpics from the director including Spy Kids ($26.5M in March 2001) and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3D ($12.6M in June 2005). Shorts tells a handful of stories about a group of boys that finds a magical rock that grants wishes.[rtimage]MapID=1198526&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=29&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s G-Force held up well slipping just 39% to an estimated $4.2M boosting the total to $107.3M. Dropping 32% in its sixth round was Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince with an estimated $290.3M. Following in ninth was the romantic comedy The Ugly Truth with an estimated $2.9M, off 36%, giving Sony $82.9M to date.Opening poorly in tenth was Fox’s Post Grad with an estimated $2.8M from 1,959 locations for a dismal $1,429 average. The PG-13 pic stars Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls fame as a young jobless woman who recently finished college. Faring even worse was the extreme sports doc X Games 3D: The Movie which bowed to an estimated $800,000 from a very wide 1,399 theaters for an atrocious $572 average. Both new releases targeted teens and young adults in their final days of summer vacation but failed to offer anything worth paying top dollar for.[rtimage]MapID=1190015&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $108M which was up 31% from last year when Tropic Thunder remained in the top spot with $16.3M; and up 29% from 2007 when Superbad stayed at number one with $18M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"shows, Disney, aapi, Brie, Travel, Dead, Broadway, 99%, TCA","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Tarantinos-Basterds-Take-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509138513851","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Funny People Leads Sluggish Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Funny People Leads Sluggish WeekendThe Collector takes home little loot.by Gitesh Pandya | August 2, 2009 |  CommentsComedy heavyweights Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow claimed the number one spotwith their new dramedyFunny People which debuted to only moderate results leading the entire topten to slump to its lowest point of the summer. Two other new releases, thekidpic Aliensin the Attic and the horror film The Collector,both struggled to find ticket buyers helping the North American box office onceagain fall below year-ago levels for the fourth consecutive weekend.Universal claimed the top spot withFunny People which debuted to an estimated $23.4M making for the lowestgross for a number one film all summer. Playing in 3,007 locations, the R-ratedstory of a Hollywood superstar facing death averaged a healthy $7,795 pertheater. Reviews were mixed for the reported $75M production.[rtimage]MapID=1205730&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Friday generated $8.7M in opening day grosses but sales tumbled 15% on Saturdayto $7.5M signaling bad word-of-mouth. The weekend estimate Universal reportedwas very aggressive as it includes a scant 3% Saturday-to-Sunday decline. Finalgrosses will be reported on Monday and the three-day figure may end up closer to$22M.Funny People, which co-stars Seth Rogen, Leslie Mann, Jonah Hill, andEric Bana, opened weaker than Apatow’s last directorial effort Knocked Upwhich bowed to $30.7M in June 2007 with a $10,690 average. With Sandler being abigger and more reliable star, Funny was expected to at least open in thesame vicinity. Even last weekend’s The Ugly Truth with Knocked Upstar Katherine Heigl did better with its $27.6M bow from fewer theaters.[rtimage]MapID=1205730&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=8&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]People’s Saturday drop and weak B- CinemaScore grade hints at a troubled pathahead. Audiences may be finding it too serious for an Apatow pic and notimmature enough for a Sandler flick. The actor has scored $100M hits in each ofthe last seven years (tying Will Smith) but never with an R-rated entry.Sandler’s younger fans may have been kept out because of the rating. A runningtime of nearly two-and-a-half hours also tested the patience of moviegoers.Universal has suffered through a very forgettable summer and Funny Peoplehas added another headache. Land of the Lost is considered one of theseason’s most expensive flops with less than $50M collected, Public Enemieshasn’t been a blockbuster despite the starpower, and Brüno fared wellon opening day but has been plummeting by at least 66% each weekend since. Thestudio could possibly end the summer without any $100M hits. It had four lastsummer when the it focused mostly on franchise action films.[rtimage]MapID=1205730&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=32&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With most IMAX locations finally getting to open Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince this past Wednesday, the latestwizard flick enjoyed the smallest third-weekend decline for the franchise since2002. Prince’s Friday-to-Sunday take fell just 40% to an estimated $17.7Mallowing it to hold steady in second place. Domestic cume to date rocketed to$255.5M. The last Potter installment to enjoy a smaller drop in the thirdouting was Chamber of Secrets which dipped only 24% thanks to theThanksgiving holiday session.Warner Bros. was able to debut the new Hogwarts chapter in 166 additional IMAXvenues this past week following the five-week run those screens had for the newTransformers pic. That boosted the playdate count for Prince to4,393 this weekend making it the widest film release in history edging out the4,366 of last summer’s The Dark Knight, another Warners smash. The new Potter seems likely to hit $300M in North America.[rtimage]MapID=1189302&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=48&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Half-Blood Prince again ruled the overseas box office this weekend grossingan estimated $42.7M from over 13,200 screens in 64 markets propelling theinternational cume to a sensational $492.3M. The global gross flew to aneye-popping $747.8M in just under three weeks of release. Top offshore marketsare the United Kingdom with $66.5M, Japan with $50.8M, and Germany with $48.2M.Close behind in third was last week’s top entry G-Force withan estimated $17.1M for a 46% sophomore decline. It was a bigger fall than thoseexperienced by fellow summer 3D kidpics Up and Ice Age: Dawn of theDinosaurs which depreciated by 35% and 34%, respectively, in their secondweekends. After ten days, Disney’s spy actioner has grossed $66.5M and is hopingto reach $110-120M by the end of its run.[rtimage]MapID=10009462&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With a new Apatow flick in the marketplace, The Ugly Truthtook a major hit falling 53% but still collected a sizable gross taking in anestimated $13M in its second weekend. The ten-day total for Sony stands at$54.5M. Budgeted at $38M, the Katherine Heigl-Gerard Butler pic should end upwith an encouraging $90-100M. Sony hasn’t been too big of a player at the boxoffice this summer so Truth will be a welcome hit.Opening in fifth place and barely making a dent in the summer movie season wasthe new kidpic Aliens in theAttic which took in an estimated $7.8M from 3,106 theaters for a weak$2,511 average. The Fox release tried to play to families and older kids, butcouldn’t compete with the high-octane competition from all the wizards andguinea pigs infesting multiplexes.[rtimage]MapID=1197086&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=15&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The horror flick Orphan held up reasonably well dropping 44%, encouraging for a frightflick, to an estimated $7.3M boosting the total to $26.8M in ten days.

Fox’s Ice Age threequel dipped 37% to an estimated $5.3M upping the total to$181.8M. Close behind was the runaway smash The Hangoverwith an estimated $5.1M, off only 21%, for a stellar $255.8M cume. Thepost-bachelor party flick has now spent nine consecutive weekends in the top tenmatching Paul Blart: Mall Cop, Taken, and Monsters vs. Aliensfor the most of any 2009 releases. The only film to spend more time thiscalendar year was Oscar champ Slumdog Millionaire which spent 11 totalframes in the top ten.Sandra Bullock claimed ninth place with her top grosser ever, The Proposal,which took in an estimated $4.8M, down just 24%, for a $148.9M sum. The BuenaVista release has been a consistent go-to choice for adult women and couples.Falling 43% to tenth place was the year’s largest hit Transformers: Revenge ofthe Fallen with an estimated $4.6M raising the cume to $388.1M.Scaring up little excitement outside of the top ten was the new horror film TheCollector which debuted poorly with an estimated $3.6M.

The violent horror-comedy Zombieland enjoyed a strong debut in first place bumping the studio’s animated 3D pic Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs into second after two weeks on top. But some other studios collected a bit of cash too. Disney’s double feature Toy Story &amp; Toy Story 2 (3D) drew impressive numbers in third while Warner Bros. saw lackluster results for its Ricky Gervais comedy The Invention of Lying in fourth. Debuting less impressively were Drew Barrymore’s roller derby flick Whip It and Michael Moore’s documentary Capitalism: A Love Story which both tied for sixth.Audiences didn’t skip their latest chance to see characters find new ways to rid the world of the undead as Zombieland powered its way to an estimated $25M this weekend from 3,036 theaters for a muscular $8,235 average. The R-rated film starring Woody Harrelson ended a month-long streak of horror films failing miserably at the box office. In fact, Zombieland fared better than the openings of September’s Pandorum, Jennifer’s Body, White Out, and Sorority Row – combined.[rtimage]MapID=1207888&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=20&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The comical story of human survivors outsmarting an endless string of zombies appealed to moviegoers as did a quirky marketing campaign. Reviews were extraordinarily positive with many critics calling it the American answer to the British cult hit Shaun of the Dead. Studio research showed that the audience was 56% male and 58% under 25 which was not surprising for this type of pic. With a $24M budget, and early word-of-mouth being positive, Zombieland looks to become a moneymaker. In a business dominated by sequels and tentpoles, Sony has been on fire lately with a series of relatively low-cost hits including District 9, Julie &amp; Julia, and The Ugly Truth.After two weeks on top of the box office menu, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs slipped to second but only lost one-third of its business to gross an estimated $16.7M in its third course. The Sony hit toon suffered a decline that was twice as big as last weekend’s when it dipped by a mere 17%. However, with Disney stealing away 3D screens and audience attention with Toy Story, the Meatballs drop was commendable. With a stellar cume of $82.4M in 17 days, Cloudy could still go on to reach $130-140M.[rtimage]MapID=1196077&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Families flocked to the three-hour double feature Toy Story &amp; Toy Story 2 (3D) spending an estimated $12.5M to see a pair of films that have been available on video for years. The Disney stunt generated a strong $7,163 average from 1,745 digital 3D locations as the studio successfully hyped up the event nature of the release. In addition to the 3D upgrade, moviegoers got two modern classics for the price of one and enjoyed a preview of next summer’s Toy Story 3 in the middle. Disney promoted this as a two-week-only event so moviegoers responded to the limited time offer. The performance was impressive given the staying power of the new 3D hit Meatballs which is playing to the exact same audience.Ricky Gervais saw good news and bad news this weekend with his latest comedy opening better than his last, but still not putting much of a dent into the overall box office. The well-reviewed The Invention of Lying bowed to an estimated $7.4M from 1,707 playdates for a mediocre $4,306 average. Compared to last fall’s Ghost Town which debuted to only $5M, Lying‘s weekend was 47% better and its average was up 29%. But the tale of the first man in history who learns how to lie showed once again that Gervais, though highly respected, is still no bankable star at the multiplexes on this side of the Atlantic. Lying also launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland this weekend with preliminary estimates showing it in a two-way race for first place with Fame.[rtimage]MapID=1200766&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fifth place was claimed by Bruce Willis and android Bruce Willis who joined forces in the sci-fi pic Surrogates which fell 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $7.3M. After ten days, the Buena Vista release has grossed a disappointing $26.4M and seems headed for a $40-45M final. The action film cost $80M to produce.Two new wide openers tied for sixth place with an estimated $4.9M each. Drew Barrymore’s directorial debut Whip It didn’t whip up too much excitement averaging a mild $2,820 from 1,720 sites. The roller derby pic was released by Fox Searchlight and garnered strong reviews. Also faring well with critics but not paying moviegoers was Michael Moore’s Capitalism: A Love Story which expanded nationally after a sizzling limited bow last week. The filmmaker’s latest doc averaged $5,042 from 962 theaters seeing just moderate results that did not match up to Moore’s previous hits. 2007’s Sicko also expanded wide in the second weekend and grossed a similar $4.5M but from a more narrow release in 441 locations for a solid $10,208 average. Capitalism may have gone too wide, too fast. Cume is $5.3M.[rtimage]MapID=1202767&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]MGM’s dance remake Fame stumbled 53% in its second weekend grossing an estimated $4.8M. The $18M-budgeted film has grossed $16.6M in ten days and should end its run with roughly $25M. Matt Damon followed with The Informant! which collected an estimated $3.8M, off 43%, for a $26.6M total for Warner Bros. Jennifer Aniston’s Love Happens rounded out the top ten dipping 36% to an estimated $2.8M giving Universal a weak $18.9M to date.In limited release, Paramount saw sensational results for its unorthodox release of the no-budget horror film Paranormal Activity which is only playing midnight shows in selected theaters. The Slamdance hit sold out every one of those showings grossing an estimated $535,000 from only 33 locations for an amazing $16,212 average. Paramount will expand on Friday to over 40 cities with theaters playing the film throughout the day with normal showtimes in hopes of a bigger breakout hit in the weeks leading up to Halloween.The top ten films grossed an estimated $89.9M which was off 1% from last year when Beverly Hills Chihuahua opened in the top spot with $29.3M; but up a healthy 42% from 2007 when The Game Plan remained at number one with $16.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Valentine's, CW, Christmas, Comic, who","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-WrapUp-Audiences-flock-to-Zombieland"},{"id":"47509138505654","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Final Destination Stays On Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Final Destination Stays On TopInglourious Basterds, All About Steve round out the top spot.by Gitesh Pandya | September 7, 2009 |  CommentsWhile the summer movie season started with a bang with the sharp claws of a mutant super hero, it ended quietly over the four-day Labor Day holiday session with the 3D horror sequel The Final Destination topping the lowest-grossing weekend of 2009. None of the three new releases managed to unseat last weekend’s box office winner and the Top 20 sunk to just $116M over four days and $91M over three days — the worst such tally of the year.With moviegoers not showing much excitement for the weekend’s new releases, The Final Destination remained at number one by default grossing an estimated $15.4M in its second round over the four-day holiday session. The Warner Bros. thriller witnessed a drop of 55% across the three-day period which was normal for fright films. After 11 days of play, the fourth installment in the successful franchise has scared up a sturdy $50.7M. A $70M final seems likely for Final which will be the best gross of the series. This weekend’s three-day take of $12.3M was the lowest for any number one film since Bangkok Dangerous bowed on top to $7.8M this weekend one year ago.[rtimage]MapID=1207470&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Brad Pitt’s supporting role in Inglourious Basterds led to an estimated $15M in ticket sales over four days in the third weekend putting it close behind in second. The Weinstein Co. release dropped moderately and raised its 18-day cume to a solid $95.2M. Overseas, Universal has grossed an additional $83.3M putting the global tally at $178.5M for the $70M-budgeted Nazi drama.Opening in third place was the critically-panned romantic comedy All About Steve with an estimated $13.9M over four days. Fox’s PG-13 film averaged a healthy $6,175 from 2,251 theaters. The turnout was larger than expected as the film took advantage of the good will generated this summer for stars Sandra Bullock and Bradley Cooper after their runaway comedy hits The Proposal and The Hangover, respectively. Plus with so many violent and male-skewing movies dominating the multiplexes over the last few weeks, Steve played as nice counter-programming to women looking for something light and funny. Critics showered the pic with some of the worst reviews of the year however, making it an early contender for Razzie nominations.[rtimage]MapID=1202106&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=7&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Gerard Butler didn’t flex too much muscle with his new action offering Gamer which debuted in fourth place with an estimated $11.2M. The R-rated pic about a gaming system where players control real people and weapons averaged a lackluster $4,476 from 2,502 locations for Lionsgate over the Friday-to-Monday period. Competition for young men was intense between all the other violent R pics in release as well as from college and pro football games over the weekend.Sony’s District 9 has become that rare sci-fi movie with legs and broke the $100M mark this weekend. The alien flick dipped to an estimated $9M boosting the total to $103.3M and counting. It is the 20th release of 2009 to join the century club. Following in sixth was the horror sequel Halloween II which collapsed in its second weekend tumbling to an estimated $7.1M for an 11-day tally of $27.1M. This latest reboot of the Michael Myers franchise could be dead, that is until it gets a new lease on life years from now.[rtimage]MapID=1190668&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=20&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Meryl Streep’s Julie &amp; Julia grossed an estimated $7M giving Sony $80.6M to date. Testosterone pic G.I. Joe fell to an estimated $6.7M lifting Paramount’s cume to $141M.Two films with just over $5M in four days rounded out the top ten. The Time Traveler’s Wife dropped to an estimated $5.5M and has taken in $55.8M thus far for Warner Bros. Miramax debuted the Mike Judge-directed comedy Extract to a weak response with audiences spending an estimated $5.3M for an average of just $3,298 over the long weekend from 1,611 locations. Reviews were mixed for the R-rated title.[rtimage]MapID=1211183&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With the summer now almost in the books, the latest cumulative grosses for the top ten movies of the season included $400.7M for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, $297.6M for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, $290.9M for Up, $272.2M for The Hangover, $257.2M for Star Trek, $194.2M for Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, $179.9M for X-Men Origins: Wolverine, $176.8M for Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, $161.1M for The Proposal, and $141M for G.I. Joe.Opening to solid numbers in platform release was National Geographic’s Amreeka with an estimated $70,000 from only four theaters for a $17,500 average over the long holiday weekend. Reviews were generally good for the PG-13 pic about a single mom from the West Bank that moves to the U.S. It will expand to more cities on September 18.The top ten films grossed an estimated $96.1M over four days which was up 12% from last year’s Labor Day holiday session when Tropic Thunder held the top spot with $14.6M; but down 16% from 2007’s holiday when Halloween opened at number one with $30.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box OfficeGuru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"renewed, james, All, National, halloween, dogs, OneApp, south, Netflix, Best, Watching, series, star, History, joker","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Final-Destination-Stays-On-Top"},{"id":"47509139976138","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Zac Attacks #1 Spot with 17 Again","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Zac Attacks #1 Spot with 17 AgainState of Play and Monsters vs. Aliens round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | April 19, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend Zac Efron scored his second number one opener in six months as his non-musical high school comedy 17 Again debuted powerfully in the top spot to lead the North American box office to another impressive year-over-year gain. Russell Crowe‘s murder thriller State of Play bowed in second place while Jason Statham‘s action sequel Crank High Voltage limped to a weak sixth place opening.Efron proved that he could draw a sizable crowd of paying customers outside of his safe Disney zone with 17 Again which premiered with an estimated $24.1M winning this weekend’s box office race by a wide $10M margin. The PG-13 film about a thirtysomething dad who transforms back to a teenage kid averaged a very solid $7,393 from 3,255 locations. Teens and young adults turned out in strong numbers and the teen heartthrob’s large fan base certainly followed their superstar into new territory. Efron’s High School Musical 3 carried a G rating while the musical Hairspray in which he had a supporting role was rated PG. And with 17 Again not being based on a property with a built-in audience, it proved that Efron can certainly open a film on his own when starring in the right type of project. For Warner Bros., it was the studio’s industry-leading fifth number one opener of 2009. No other distributor has more than two this year.[rtimage]MapID=1201402&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Landing in second with a decent showing was the conspiracy thriller State of Play which took in an estimated $14.1M from 2,803 theaters. Averaging a commendable $5,030 per site, the PG-13 film stars Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Helen Mirren, Jason Bateman, Robin Wright Penn, and Rachel McAdams. Reviews were solid for the Universal release which played to a mature crowd not being served by all the younger-skewing pics in the marketplace. According to studio research, State‘s audience was 55% female and 75% over 35.Three hit holdovers followed with estimates between $12-13M. Final grosses to be reported on Monday could see chart positions change.Paramount and DreamWorks claimed third place with the animated blockbuster Monsters vs. Aliens which became the top-grossing movie of 2009. The comic actioner grossed an estimated $12.9M falling 41% in its fourth frame to boost the cume to a stellar $162.7M. Monsters also surpassed the $154.5M of last spring’s Horton Hears a Who which was the top grosser during the first four months of 2008. Monsters vs. Aliens is now on course to become the third biggest non-Shrek toon in DreamWorks history after last summer’s Kung Fu Panda ($215.4M) and 2005’s Madagascar ($193.2M).[rtimage]MapID=1194516&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s Hannah Montana: The Movie was close behind with an estimated $12.7M representing a steep 61% crumble in the second weekend. A large fall was expected but the sophomore slide was a bit less than those for last year’s Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: The Best of Both Worlds and High School Musical 3 which were 67% and 64%, respectively. The new Hannah has banked an impressive $56.1M in ten days and could reach $80M by the end of its run.Fast &amp; Furious took in an estimated $12.3M, falling 55% in its third lap, and boosted its 17-day take to a strong $136.7M. Universal’s hit sequel ruled the international box office again grossing an estimated $36M this weekend from 59 territories including powerful top spot bows in Australia, Italy, and China. Total is now $145M offshore and $281.7M worldwide easily making it the highest-grossing installment of the series globally. The Furious franchise has now raced to a stunning $881M worldwide across four films.[rtimage]MapID=1196211&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=94&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Five Jason Statham action films in 15 months seemed to be too much for fans to handle as the actor’s latest effort Crank High Voltage stumbled with an estimated $6.5M debut putting it in sixth place. The R-rated Lionsgate sequel averaged a not-so-heartpumping $2,928 from 2,223 locations. The opening not only was weaker than the bow of 2006’s Crank ($10.5M, $4,158 average) but it also fell sharply from the debuts of Statham’s last two films Death Race ($12.6M, $4,985 average) and Transporter 3 ($12.1M, $4,594 average).Suffering the worst drop of any film in the top ten was Seth Rogen’s latest comedy Observe and Report which tumbled 63% to an estimated $4.1M. Moviegoers could be getting too much of this star as well. The Warner Bros. release has collected $18.7M in ten days and should finish in the vicinity of $25M. The Nicolas Cage actioner Knowing followed with an estimated $3.5M, off 46%, pushing the total to $73.7M for Summit making it one of the top ten highest-grossing new releases of the year.[rtimage]MapID=10003713&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Two more hits rounded out the top ten.

Former chart-toppers Fast &amp; Furious and Monsters vs. Aliens kicked in over $20M a piece powering the overall marketplace to its best showing ever for the bunny holiday.Disney ruled the North American box office with an estimated $34M opening for Hannah over the Friday-to-Sunday period as the actress/rocker’s fan base came out in droves. The G-rated film about the popular television character’s reconnection to her roots averaged a powerful $10,904 from 3,118 theaters. It was the second biggest opening ever over the Easter holiday frame trailing only 2006’s Scary Movie ($40.2M). Hannah also scored the fifth largest April debut after Fast &amp; Furious ($71M), Anger Management ($42.2M), Scary 4, and The Scorpion King ($36.1M).[rtimage]MapID=1207961&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=8&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The teen superstar first proved her box office clout last year with the music pic Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert which debuted at number one over Super Bowl weekend with a stunning $31.1M from only 683 3D venues for an eye-popping $45,561 average. Higher $15 ticket prices, a more narrow release, and the promotion of the film as a one-week-only event made it a unique player at the box office. But Hannah Montana The Movie proved that the tween brand is still strong a year later and that Miley can open a regular film on her own. Cyrus has now seen her last two films both open at number one with $30M+ debuts, something most Hollywood A-listers can’t claim. Her talent reps must now see whether she can still open a picture outside of the Hannah Montana franchise. Next up for the sixteen-year-old is The Last Song, based on the Nicholas Sparks novel, which Disney plans to have in theaters next year.The studio chose Easter weekend for Montana since most of its target audience of school children and parents would have extra time off thanks to schools being closed on Good Friday. That holiday helped propel opening day sales to a stunning $17.3M as intense demand pulled most of the crowd out in the first day. Saturday fell sharply by 40% to $10.3M while Easter Sunday is estimated by Disney to drop by 38% to $6.4M. More than half of the weekend tally was collected on Friday. The audience breakdown had no surprises – 79% of the crowd was female, 60% was under 17, and two-thirds were families.[rtimage]MapID=1196211&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=95&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Dropping back to second place was last weekend’s gargantuan opener Fast &amp; Furious which tumbled 59% to an estimated $28.8M in its second lap. The sophomore weekend decline was in line with past films from the franchise as 2003’s 2 Fast 2 Furious dropped 63% while 2006’s The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift fell by 59%. Neither had a holiday helping the second frame. After ten days, the new Furious has raced to a stunning $118M and should speed past the $127.2M of 2 Fast next weekend before eventually racing ahead of the $144.5M of the original The Fast and the Furious from 2001. A final domestic tally of $160-170M could result for the Vin Diesel–Paul Walker reunion.Overseas has been on fire too as the Universal smash grossed an estimated $46.5M this weekend from 50 territories to boost the international sum to $91M. The global gross now stands at an incredible $209M after less than two weeks and by the end of this week, the racing sequel will become the highest-grossing installment of the lucrative series on a worldwide basis. Talks have already begun on a fifth chapter starring both leads.[rtimage]MapID=1194516&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Kids lured in by 3D gimmickry were still lining up for the animated adventure Monsters vs. Aliens which pulled in an estimated $22.6M in its third weekend. Off just 31%, the PG-rated smash posted a great hold and boosted its total to a stellar $141M in 17 days. Monsters is now on the same course as two recent toon sequels that made a killing running only 4% behind the pace of 2006’s Ice Age: The Meltdown and 3% ahead of last fall’s Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. Those blockbusters each went on to gross north of $180M domestically and more than $590M worldwide. Meltdown, like Monsters, had Easter to help the third frame but its drop was bigger at 41% and its weekend take was smaller at $20M. By the end of the week, the DreamWorks hit will become the top-grossing film of 2009 and could find its way to the neighborhood of $190M from North America alone.This weekend underscored how big moviegoing has been this year over holiday sessions. All three holiday frames this year not only beat 2008 numbers, but soared ahead by more than 20% in each case. Compared to last year, 2009’s Martin Luther King weekend was up 24%, Presidents’ Day frame was up 33%, and the Easter session climbed 26%.[rtimage]MapID=1207394&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Monsters voice actor Seth Rogen opened a new live-action comedy Observe and Report this weekend, but bowed at number four with a mediocre $11M, according to estimates. The Warner Bros. release averaged a mild $4,085 from 2,727 sites and performed much like the actor’s last R-rated laugher Zack and Miri Make a Porno which opened to $10.1M from 2,735 locations last fall. Observe, which co-starred Anna Faris, featured Rogen playing a mall cop battling a streaker menacing his domain. Reviews were mixed.The two films that followed both enjoyed small declines over the holiday frame. Nicolas Cage‘s actioner Knowing dipped by only 18% to an estimated $6.7M for Summit boosting the cume to a solid $68M. Paramount’s comedy I Love You, Man slid by just 17% to an estimated $6.4M for a $59M total to date. Dropping 40% to an estimated $5.7M was The Haunting in Connecticut which has taken in $46.3M for Lionsgate so far.[rtimage]MapID=10003713&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Failing to connect with moviegoers was the new sci-fi action pic Dragonball Evolution which limped to a $4.7M debut, according to estimates, putting it in eighth place. The PG-rated film was aimed at young boys but was rejected averaging a weak $2,132 from 2,181 locations for Fox.Rounding out the top ten were Miramax’s Adventureland with an estimated $3.4M and Universal’s Duplicity with an estimated $3M. The theme park comedy fell by 40% in its second weekend and lifted its ten-day tally to a disappointing $11.5M while the Julia Roberts spy flick eased by only 28% raising the cume to $36.8M, a low figure for the A-list actress.[rtimage]MapID=1203586&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=8&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $126.4M which was up a scorching 63% from last year when Prom Night opened in the top spot with $20.8M; and up a solid 34% from last year’s Easter frame which fell in mid-March when Horton Hears a Who stayed at number one with $24.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Musical, cartoon, movies, FX","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Hannah-Montana-Sings-Her-Way-to-the-Top"},{"id":"47509139960770","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Still Choose The Hangover","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Still Choose The HangoverUp and The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 round out the top spots,by Gitesh Pandya | June 14, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend moviegoers could not get enough of Mike Tyson’s tiger as the raunchy Vegas-set comedy The Hangover spent a second weekend at number one, dropping a remarkably low amount, and is on course to become the top-grossing R-rated comedy of all time. Also holding up well was the toon titan Up which remained in second place with a small decline of its own as it attempts to become Pixar’s biggest blockbuster ever. Among new releases, Denzel Washington’s hostage thriller The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 landed in third place with a respectable bow while Eddie Murphy’s family comedy Imagine That was dead on arrival with one of the worst openings of the year.Sliding only 26% from its surprisingly powerful debut, The Hangover was once again the top choice for ticket buyers selling an estimated $33.4M worth of stubs this weekend to lead all films in the marketplace. The Warner Bros. hit has now grossed a stunning $105.4M in just 10 days. Normally only big-budget action movies join the century club this fast, not no-star comedies costing under $30M. Moviegoers that took a wait-and-see approach last weekend were infected by the buzz and the post-bachelor party flick is now broadening its audience and benefiting from strong recommendations.[rtimage]MapID=1207417&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The second weekend drop was even lower than those enjoyed by other popular R-rated summer comedies like &gt;Knocked Up (36%), Tropic Thunder (37%), and Superbad (45%). Instead, Hangover‘s decline was much like the 24% that both leggy 2005 hits Wedding Crashers and The 40-Year-Old Virgin enjoyed. Hangover had little competition from new releases this weekend for its core audience of young adults as one film was an action offering playing older and the other was a comedy that was completely ignored. The sleeper hit now looks to surge past the $200M mark and could even surpass Wedding Crashers to become the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever.Holding steady in the runnerup spot with a small decline of its own was the animated blockbuster Up which took in an estimated $30.5M in its third frame. Down only 31%, the Disney/Pixar sensation boosted its 17-day cume to a robust $187.2M. Up has now joined Shrek 2 as the only animated films in box office history to gross more than $30M in each of their first three frames. Third weekend grosses for other big toon hits include $28.4M for Finding Nemo, $28.2M for Shrek, $28M for Shrek the Third, and $26.5M for The Incredibles.[rtimage]MapID=1195997&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=17&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Compared to Nemo, Pixar’s top performer ever, Up scored a larger third weekend gross and a smaller decline beating the fish pic’s 39% drop. Nemo took in $191.5M in its first 17 days during the same time of year on its way to $339.7M and Up now looks to be on a trajectory to break the $300M mark as well thanks to great word-of-mouth and strong repeat business.Denzel Washington faced off with John Travolta in the action remake The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 which debuted in third place with an estimated $25M. The Tony Scott-directed pic averaged a solid $8,133 from 3,074 locations and ended up in the same range as many of Washington’s previous R-rated action films. In fact, the casting of Travolta seemed to add little value at the box office. Openings for Washington include $29M for Inside Man, $22.8M for Man on Fire, and $22.6M for Training Day. Pelham gave the Oscar winner his third best career opening after American Gangster ($43.6M) and Inside.[rtimage]MapID=1207149&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fox’s franchise flick Night at the Museum dipped only 34% in its fourth adventure to an estimated $9.6M. Total to date stands at $143.4M. Following its poor showing on opening weekend, Will Ferrell’s competing action-comedy Land of the Lost fell 51% to an estimated $9.2M finishing in fifth. The $100M+ production has taken in just $35M in ten days for Universal and should stumble to a lackluster $55-60M final tally.Eddie Murphy enjoyed a big win this weekend as he beat out the opening of his last dud Meet Dave. But just by an inch. The comedian’s latest attempt at PG-rated family comedy Imagine That was rejected by parents and kids opening in seventh place to a dismal $5.7M, according to estimates. Paramount released the $55M production in 3,008 theaters and was rewarded with a laughable $1,895 average. It was the third worst opening weekend average for a wide opener all year faring better than only Battle for Terra ($933 from 1,160 theaters) and Miss March ($1,383 from 1,742). In fact, the last movie to open in 3,000+ theaters and generate a lower average than Imagine That was actually Meet Dave last July with its dreadful $5.3M from 3,011 sites and $1,744 average. Big paychecks for family comedies may have dried up for Eddie.[rtimage]MapID=1190964&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Star Trek didn’t have the lowest decline in the top ten this time, but the sci-fi reboot still held up very well in its sixth round grossing an estimated $5.6M. Off only 33%, the Paramount smash lifted its total to $232M. Rival actioner Terminator Salvation followed with an estimated $4.7M, down 43%, for a $113.8M total for Warner Bros.Sony’s Angels &amp; Demons ranked eighth falling 36% to an estimated $4.2M boosting the domestic total to $123.3M. Rounding out the top ten was the horror flick Drag Me to Hell which scared up an estimated $3.9M, down 45%, giving Universal $35.1M to date.[rtimage]MapID=1189217&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=13&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Audiences have been cutting their spending on sequels this summer. Battle of the Smithsonian is running 23% behind the pace of the first Night at the Museum at the same point in its run, Terminator Salvation is 17% behind T3, and Angels &amp; Demons is 38% behind The Da Vinci Code. Add in higher ticket prices and the gaps widen when comparing admissions.Francis Ford Coppola’s new self-distributed pic Tetro debuted impressively in platform release grossing an estimated $31,339 from solo houses in New York and Los Angeles for a solid $15,670 average. Since its Thursday launch, the Buenos Aires-set drama has collected $38,169. Expanding successfully in limited play was the Focus comedy Away We Go which widened from four to 45 locations taking in an estimated $554,000 for an encouraging $12,311 average. Many indie films collapse after expanding from New York and Los Angeles but this quirky pregnancy pic showed strength in over a dozen markets making it a true independent hit attracting the non-popcorn crowd.The top ten films grossed an estimated $131.7M which was down 25% from last year when The Incredible Hulk opened in the top spot with $55.4M; and off 4% from 2007 when Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer debuted at number one with $58.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandyawww.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Awards, doctor, TCA, Nickelodeon, story, Prime, comics, Day, international","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Audiences-Still-Choose-The-Hangover"},{"id":"47509142273997","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Power Knowing To # 1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Power Knowing To # 1I Love You, Man and Duplicity round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | March 22, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend Moviegoers still love Nicolas Cage action flicks as the actor’s latest film, the doomsday thriller Knowing, easily beat out two other new releases to capture the top spot at the North American box office. Opening in second and third respectively were the buddy comedy I Love You, Man starring Paul Rudd and the Julia Roberts-Clive Owen spy pic Duplicity. With the trio of new titles pulling in over $57M, most holdovers suffered sizable drops as the overall marketplace lagged behind last year’s numbers by a slim margin.Scoring his eleventh number one opening since winning an Oscar in 1996, Cage led the effects-driven actioner Knowing to a strong $24.8M debut, according to estimates. The Summit release averaged a potent $7,447 from 3,332 theaters and gave the young studio its second number one opener in four months. The company’s vampire smash Twilight hit the top of the charts during its November launch and hit DVD this weekend with its Saturday street date. Knowing, which finds Cage playing a professor who discovers a code that can predict future disasters, was rated PG-13 and played evenly to males and females according to studio research. The audience was older as 63% of the crowd was 25 or over. Critics mostly pointed their thumbs down, but ticket buyers didn’t care.[rtimage]MapID=10003713&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=7&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The male bonding comedy I Love You, Man debuted in second with an estimated $18M for Paramount. Starring Paul Rudd and Jason Segal, the R-rated laugher averaged an impressive $6,641 from 2,711 locations and performed much like the last comedies from each actor. Rudd’s Role Models bowed to $19.2M last November while Segal’s Forgetting Sarah Marshall opened to $17.7M last April. Both carried R ratings and played to young adults just like Man reaching final tallies of $67.3M and $62.9M, respectively. Reviews were generally positive.Julia Roberts and Clive Owen debuted in third place with their caper pic Duplicity which grossed an estimated $14.4M from 2,574 theaters for a solid $5,595 average. Universal’s PG-13 film about former spies that plot a con operation against a pair of corporations marked Roberts’ first lead role in a live-action wide opener in more than five years. During that time, the Oscar-winning actress took many supporting roles in films that were not anchored by her like Ocean’s Twelve and Charlie Wilson’s War. This time around she was the main star and settled for third place, but still posted numbers that were very respectable. Openings for her films from the early part of this decade include $11.5M for 2003’s Mona Lisa Smile, $20.1M for The Mexican, and $28.1M for 2000’s Erin Brockovich. Reviews were decent and the adult female audience could continue to show up in the weeks to come. Duplicity had the best Friday-to-Saturday bump among the weekend’s new releases with 27% compared to Knowing‘s 9% and I Love You, Man‘s 7%.[rtimage]MapID=1203586&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Even with no new family films opening, Disney’s PG-rated adventure Race to Witch Mountain still suffered a sizable drop falling 47% to an estimated $13M in its second weekend. After ten days, the Dwayne Johnson starrer has banked $44.7M. Race is nearly on par with Johnson’s last kid-friendly offering for the studio, 2007’s The Game Plan, although it opened stronger and is falling harder. Game Plan bowed to $23M and dipped only 28% in the second frame for a ten-day tally of $43.2M on its way to a $90.6M final. With DreamWorks charging into theaters aggressively on Friday with its 3D toon Monster vs. Aliens which could generate the biggest opening of the year, the Disney actioner may see more big declines ahead ending its run with $80-85M.In its third weekend, the comic flick Watchmen fell another 62% and grossed an estimated $6.8M raising the 17-day cume to $98.1M for Warner Bros. At its current trajectory, the final domestic gross should finish with about $110M. Universal’s horror redo The Last House on the Left also fell hard dropping to an estimated $5.9M in its sophomore frame, down 58%, for a total of $24M in ten days.[rtimage]MapID=1184697&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Fox companies followed with their $130M+ blockbusters. Liam Neeson’s Taken took in an estimated $4.1M in seventh place, off 38%, for a sum of $133.1M. Fox Searchlight’s Slumdog Millionaire dropped 46% to an estimated $2.7M putting its gross to date at $137.2M.Falling to ninth place was Madea Goes to Jail with an estimated $2.5M, off 51%, and a total of $87.2M for Lionsgate. The Focus 3D hit Coraline slipped only 21% and pulled in an estimated $2.1M in its seventh round. Cume is $72.8M. Each film is now the second biggest grosser ever for its distributor trailing Fahrenheit 9/11 ($119.2M for Lionsgate) and Brokeback Mountain ($83M for Focus) respectively. Coincidentally, Slumdog is Searchlight’s number two all-time hit but still has a chance of surpassing the $143.5M of Juno.The top ten films grossed an estimated $94.3M which was down less than 1% from last year when Horton Hears A Who remained in the top spot with $24.6M; and down 19% from 2007 when TMNT opened at number one with $24.3M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Cinematographers, Baby, Awards, Binge, wars, American, impossible, aliens, blockbuster, Emmys, Family","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Audiences-Power-Knowing-To-1"},{"id":"47509139979212","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Fast &amp; Furious Races to $72.5M Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Fast &amp; Furious Races to $72.5M OpeningMonsters vs. Aliens falls to second place. All hail Vin and Paul!by Gitesh Pandya | April 5, 2009 |  CommentsThe turbo-charged racing sequel Fast &amp; Furious crushed its competitors and blew away all industry expectations with a launch that shattered the April opening weekend box office record. And with the animated hit Monsters vs. Aliens still doing solid business in its second frame, the overall marketplace powered its way to the highest-grossing April session ever. Together, the two juggernauts grossed more this weekend than the entire marketplace did during this same frame in 2008 continuing a scorching hot year for movie ticket sales.Universal won first place by an enormous margin with the heavily-hyped Fast &amp; Furious which bowed to an estimated $72.5M from 3,461 theaters for an eye-popping $20,950 average. It was easily the biggest debut of the year racing past the $59.3M of Monsters from just last weekend, and it smashed the old record for April openers held by Anger Management with $42.2M in 2003. The fourth installment in the popular racing series even posted the second largest debut ever in the entire January-to-April corridor trailing only The Passion of the Christ‘s $83.8M from February 2004. It was a summer-like opening in the middle of spring.[rtimage]MapID=1196211&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=82&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The new Fast not only sped past the opening weekend grosses of all previous installments in the franchise, but it also attracted a larger audience even when ticket price increases are factored in. Openings for the lucrative series included $40.1M for 2001’s The Fast and the Furious, $50.5M for 2003’s 2 Fast 2 Furious, and $24M for 2006’s The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift which featured a new cast and setting. At today’s ticket prices, those figures would amount to roughly $52M, $61M, and $27M respectively. In just three days, the new Fast even beat Tokyo Drift‘s overall total of $62.5M. With a combined $334M domestically from the first three models, the Furious franchise could now soar past the $500M mark.The wild success this weekend can be attributed to many factors including marketing, the release date, and the casting. Universal had a tough job convincing fans to take a fourth trip with the decade-old franchise and so the four primary cast members of the first surprise hit were brought back together with a brilliant campaign led by the appealing tagline “New Model. Original Parts.” The cool factor was back. Moviegoers were drawn in by the starpower and the promise of a true adrenaline rush. The studio also made a bold move shifting the release date from June 12 where it would have faced intense summer competition, to early April where the road was clear of any traffic. The PG-13 pic had teens and young adults all to itself this weekend. And the whole industry will benefit since millions of movie fans saw trailers for the first wave of summer blockbusters.[rtimage]MapID=1196211&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=83&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]For the weekend, Fast surged to a jaw-dropping $30.5M on Friday, then fell 19% to $24.7M on Saturday, and is estimated to drop by 30% on Sunday to $17.3M. College basketball semi-finals cut into some business with young males on Saturday night. If Universal’s estimate holds, it will rank as the studio’s biggest debut ever. That record is still held by Steven Spielberg’s 1997 dino-sequel The Lost World which bowed to $72.1M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of its holiday opening (or $115M at today’s prices.) Should Fast see a more common Sunday decline of 35-40%, it would still rake in $70M over the weekend. Final box office data including actual Sunday sales figures will be reported on Monday.The Vin Diesel–Paul Walker reunion also opened overseas in 32 international territories this weekend and banked another $30.1M for a global launch of $102.6M. Many top markets are still to come including Russia, France, and the United Kingdom which all open next weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1194516&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After its top spot debut last weekend, the DreamWorks Animation hit Monsters vs. Aliens fell to second place but still attracted a large audience dropping 44% to an estimated $33.5M haul. Compared to other big March toons, the decline fell in between the 35% sophomore dip of Ice Age in 2002 and the 50% fall of its sequel Ice Age: The Meltdown in 2006. The ten-day tally for Monsters rose to $105.7M which is 9% behind the pace of Meltdown after the same period of time but up 21% over the first Ice Age. Ginormica and pals may find themselves battling their way to the neighborhood of $175M domestically.The spookfest The Haunting in Connecticut fell a sharp 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.6M settling into third place. Lionsgate’s hit thriller has banked an impressive $37.2M in ten days and looks headed for a $50M finish.Nicolas Cage saw his latest action entry Knowing fall 45% to an estimated $8.1M giving Summit $58.2M after 17 days of release. Over the same time period, Paramount’s raunchy comedy I Love You, Man has collected $49.3M thanks to an estimated $7.9M this weekend. For the second frame in a row, the R-rated laugher posted the smallest decline in the top ten.[rtimage]MapID=1196389&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The new theme park comedy Adventureland debuted to mild results with an estimated $6M opening from 1,862 locations. Averaging a lukewarm $3,228 per theater, the R-rated coming-of-age pic starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kristin Stewart earned very strong reviews but failed to capitalize on them at the multiplexes. Its target audience of older teens and young adults were clearly distracted by fast cars this weekend. Adventureland bowed to $2.2M on Friday, remained flat on Saturday with $2.2M again, and is estimated by Miramax to slip by a very low 22% on Sunday to $1.7M.The spy comedy Duplicity starring Julia Roberts and Clive Owen dropped 44% to an estimated $4.3M pushing the total to $32.4M for Universal. Following in eighth was Disney’s Race to Witch Mountain with an estimated $3.4M, down 42%, for a $58.4M sum. The John Cena actioner 12 Rounds tumbled 57% in its sophomore effort to an estimated $2.3M giving Fox a weak ten-day cume of only $9M.[rtimage]MapID=1202764&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The indie comedy hit Sunshine Cleaning starring Amy Adams and Emily Blunt expanded again in its fourth weekend and jumped into the top ten right at number ten grossing an estimated $1.9M. Averaging a respectable $3,923 from 479 sites, the Overture release has successfully widened its run throughout the country each week and has upped the total to $4.8M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $149.4M which was up a stunning 96% from last year when 21 remained in the top spot with $15.3M; and up a sizable 43% from 2007 when Blades of Glory stayed at number one with $22.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandyahttp://boxofficeguru.com/","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"ABC, All, cancelled, 20th, Star","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Fast-and-Furious-Races-to-725M-Opening"},{"id":"47509139963844","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Moviegoers Up For Pixar’s First 3D Pic","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Moviegoers Up For Pixar's First 3D PicDrag Me to Hell smolders in third place.by Gitesh Pandya | May 31, 2009 |  CommentsPixar and Disney celebrated their tenth straight number one smash with the 3Dflying house flick Up which enjoyed a strong openingatop the North American box office. The new horror film Drag Me to Hell played well to thoselooking for a scare with its third place finish. Most holdovers fell by morethan 50% from last weekend’s holiday session but overall sales for the top tenstill matched up to last year.Moviegoers spent the weekend with a grumpy old man and an adventurous youngscout as the animated film Up debuted at number onewith an estimated $68.2M from 3,766 locations. Averaging a stellar $18,109 perlocation, the PG-rated film continued Pixar’s lucky streak which has seen everyone of its offerings debut at number one in its first weekend of wide release.Grosses were boosted by extra surcharges that theaters collected for the 3Dpresentation, the first ever for Pixar. For example, New York City’s LincolnSquare theater charges $12.50 for regular tickets, but $16.50 for Up in3D.Showered with praise and glowing reviews from critics, Up enjoyed thefourth biggest opening of 2009 trailing just X-Men Origins: Wolverine($85.1M), Star Trek($75.2M), and Fast &amp; Furious ($71M). Friday kicked off the release with $21.4M,Saturday rose 24% to $26.5M, and Sunday is estimated to decline by 24% to$20.3M. Up unspooled in a record 1,534 3D locations with Disney reportingthose theaters grossing 2.2 times more than the regular-priced 2D screens.[rtimage]MapID=1195997&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Up was able to fly past the $63.1M of its studio’s last entryWALL•E, although the higher ticket prices meant theaudience size was a bit smaller. But a clear victory was won over this year’s 3Dsmash Monstersvs. Aliens from rival DreamWorks Animation which bowed to $59.3M inMarch. Not only did Monsters benefit from higher 3D prices but it alsoopened wider in 338 more locations. Up now holds the record for the biggestopening for a 3D pic.For Pixar, Up ranks as its third best debut ever after The Incredibles($70.4M in 2004) and Finding Nemo ($70.3M in 2003). And it was the sixth largest bow for anyanimated film in history behind Shrek the Third($121.6M in 2007), Shrek 2($108M in 2004), The Simpsons Movie ($74M in 2007), Incredibles, and Nemo.Disney was able to reach all audiences this weekend. Studio data showed that thecrowd was 53% female and 53% 18 and older. With a CinemaScore rating of A+, onenotch higher than WALL•E‘s A from last summer, a long life is expected.Plus kidpic offerings are light between now and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs on July 1. With more and more schoolsclosing for the school year in the coming days, Up should be able to holdup well in the weeks ahead and challenge Star Trek for the summer boxoffice crown.

After tendays of release, the PG-rated comedy adventure has pulled in an impressive$105.3M becoming the tenth film of the year to join the century club. A finaltally in the vicinity of $170M seems likely putting Smithsonian aboutone-third behind the $250.9M of the first Museumwhich opened over Christmas weekend in 2006.Universal’s supernatural thriller Drag Me toHell from director Sam Raimi debuted in third place with an estimated$16.6M from 2,508 theaters for a solid $6,630 average. While not a bad opening,the debut was a bit disappointing given the starpower of the filmmaker, lack ofhorror films for two months, and the spectacular reviews from critics. FellowPG-13 spookfests The Unborn and The Hauntingin Connecticut opened to $21.1M and $23M respectively this year.Universal even generated a $21M bow for its horror pic The Strangers ayear ago this very weekend.

That would put the newChristianBale actioner 13% behind the $150.4M gross of T3, and a troubling 28%behind in actual tickets sold. Salvation cost a reported $200M to produceand was backed by a pricey marketing campaign. Overseas, the sci-fi film openedat number one in seven Asian territories through Sony this weekend and grossed$8.6M from 673 runs for a solid $12,700 average.Posting the smallest decline in the top ten was Star Trek whichdropped to fifth with an estimated $12.8M, down 44%.

The $11 million cume for the man-machine sequel is still decent, demonstrating the fact that, contrary to US figures, the film is performing robustly in international markets. Then again, Angels and Demons has made more money than Star Trek here — so what do local audiences know?Meanwhile, Will Ferrell’s Land of the Lost — lambasted, somewhat harshly, by the Sydney Morning Herald as the worst film of 2009 — could only manage a third-place debut, and studio indie Sunshine Cleaning, starring Amy Adams and Emily Blunt, crawled into 10th place on limited release.It was encouraging news for Warwick Thornton’s Samson and Delilah, however, as the Cannes-winning Australian film continued its solid run and passed the $2 million mark in its sixth week of release.Click here for full details..","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"true, breaking, Pictures","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Boxoffice-Terminator-Hungover"},{"id":"47509139974089","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers Obsessed with Interracial Catfight","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers Obsessed with Interracial CatfightEarth and Fighting open strongly.by Gitesh Pandya | April 26, 2009 |  CommentsSinger-actressBeyoncéKnowles crushed the competition with a sizzling opening for her new romanticthriller Obsessedwhich powered well past expectations to lead the North American box office overthe final weekend before the much-anticipated start of the summer movie season.Also performing well were two other new releases – the Channing Tatum dramaFighting and the naturedocumentary Earth.Not drawing big crowds was the star-combo ofRobertDowney Jr. and Jamie Foxx in TheSoloist which bowed in fourth place. Most holdovers fell sharply losing50% or more of their business, but the top ten hit the $100M mark surging morethan 30% ahead of last year’s levels ending a record April and a busy springwith a bang.[rtimage]MapID=1207523&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Sony’s Screen Gems unit tempted audiences with a well-marketed thriller and gotoff to an explosive start with Obsessedwhich grossed an estimated $28.5M in its first weekend in theaters. Busting into2,514 locations, the PG-13 pic averaged a steamy $11,337 per site and shothigher than pre-release forecasts. The hit film stars Knowles andIdris Elba asa happily married couple until a sexy young office worker (AliLarter) begins to stalk the husband. The prospect of a woman-on-woman fightpiqued the interest of moviegoers and the collision of a black couple and awhite seductress also gave the film a must-see edge.Obsessed scored the seventh largest opening ever for the month of Apriland was a new career high for Knowles when in a lead role. It was also thesecond best in company history for Screen Gems behind the $30.1M of 2005’s The Exorcismof Emily Rose. Females drove the business for Obsessed making up58% of the crowd, according to studio research, while the age range was broadwith 51% being over 25. A modest $20M budget means Sony has yet anotherprofitable hit on its hands.[rtimage]MapID=1207523&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Obsessed also gave the film industry its eighth consecutive weekend witha $20M+ opening capping off a stellar four-month start to 2009. Over the first17 weeks of the year, the number of movies opening in wide release dropped 9%(51 vs. 56 last year). However, studios were able to reduce the clutter thatoften causes many pics to fail allowing for more marketing focus on each title.As a result, box office is up 16% and admissions are up 14%. Plus the number of$20M+ openers rose from 11 last year to 18 this year while the amount of filmscrossing the $100M mark skyrocketed from just one in 2008 to six in the currentyear. The summer box office could not have asked for more momentum as it getsunderway especially since the massive April crowds have been treated to trailersand posters for the upcoming season’s big crop of blockbusters.Zac Efron‘s high school comedy 17 Againdropped from first to second place and fell by an understandable 51% to anestimated $11.7M. With a solid $40M in ten days, the PG-13 hit looks headed fora finish of $65-70M proving that the teen heartthrob of the small screen candraw paying crowds to the multiplexes even outside of a franchise.[rtimage]MapID=1201402&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Debuting in third wasChanning Tatum‘syoung adult drama Fighting which punched up an estimated $11.4M in its opening weekend.The Rogue Pictures film was released by Universal and averaged a solid $4,955from 2,309 venues. Tatum rose to fame in 2006 with the dance drama Step Up but has beenmostly absent from the box office since then, a risky move considering therapidly shifting tastes of young people. Rated PG-13, Fighting catered toteens and young adults with males excited by the fights and females coming infor the hunky lead actor. Studio research showed that males made up 58% of theaudience while 66% were under 25.Faring worst among the weekend’s three new fictional wide releases was theviolinist drama TheSoloist which debuted to an estimated $9.7M from 2,024 theaters. TheParamount release did average a respectable $4,800 per theater, but the PG-13pic starring Robert Downey Jr. andJamie Foxxfailed to make much of a dent in the overall marketplace. Reviews were mixedwhich may have sent moviegoers elsewhere and the story of a journalist who bondswith a genius musician who happens to be homeless did little to excite thepublic. Even the casting of two popular Oscar-caliber actors couldn’t push thepic into double-digit territory. The Soloist reportedly cost $60M toproduce, a tough number to recoup especially given the film’s limited appealabroad.[rtimage]MapID=1205373&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The animal documentary Earth enjoyed arobust debut grossing an estimated $8.6M in its first weekend of play. TheG-rated tale following the stories of three sets of God’s creatures averaged ahealthy $4,742 from 1,804 locations. Rarely are documentaries given a nationwiderelease in the first weekend but Disney used Wednesday’s Earth Day as alaunching pad midweek and wound up with a stellar $14.2M over the five-day debutperiod. James Earl Jones narrated the film which earned glowing reviews. Withthe summer movie season unleashing a string of violent action films, Earthcould enjoy a promising road ahead if it can connect with parents of smallerchildren looking for fun and peaceful entertainment. Hollywood has little tooffer that lucrative segment of the audience until late May when Fox unleashesNight at the Museum 2 and Disney offers up Pixar’s Up.In its fifth weekend, the animated smash Monsters vs.Aliens slipped 36% to an estimated $8.5M boosting the total to $174.8Mto date. The year’s top-grossing film is from DreamWorks and Paramount.Universal’s conspiracy thrillerState of Playdropped a troubling 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $6.9M bringing theten-day total to a mere $25.1M. Budgeted at $60M, theRussell Crowe–BenAffleck starrer should finish up with a disappointing domestic take ofaround $40M despite positive reviews from critics. State joins Soloist as thelatest star-driven dramas targeting mature adults that are failing to find bigaudiences this year following The International and Duplicity.

However, the frame’s other new films all performed well too as the North American box office remained red hot. The wedding comedy Bride Wars debuted impressively in the bridesmaid slot while the horror flick The Unborn was close behind with a third place bow. Even the more narrow opening of the marital drama Not Easily Broken generated a sensational average. Studios released their first batch of new films since Christmas Day and audiences responded by filling up multiplexes powering the Top 20 films 15% ahead of last year.to $143M.Following four weeks of amazing grosses in limited release, Gran Torino expanded from 84 to 2,808 theaters and collected an estimated $29M. Averaging a muscular $10,337, the R-rated pic about a grumpy old man and his community of Hmong immigrants gave the two-time Oscar winning director the best opening of his half-century career easily beating the $18.1M of 2000’s Space Cowboys, also a directorial and starring effort for Eastwood. That debut at today’s ticket prices would be roughly $24M which Torino still beat.Warner Bros. has successfully used this release strategy before when targeting older adults at this time of year. Last winter, the studio opened the Jack Nicholson-Morgan Freeman film The Bucket List in 16 theaters on Christmas Day before expanding it wide this very weekend last January. It also shot straight to the top of the chart and grossed $19.4M for a $6,662 average. Four years ago, Warners platformed Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby into just eight locations in mid-December and slowly added more locations before going nationwide in its seventh weekend following the announcement of Oscar nominations. It took in $12.3M in its first wide frame and averaged $6,102. Gran Torino easily outmuscled both of those films.What makes this weekend’s gross especially impressive is the fact that Torino has not been one of the top films getting all the awards buzz this winter. The studio has spent heavily on television advertising in major markets for over a month now to keep the film in the minds of moviegoers and is seeing the investment pay off. With a $40.1M cume, Gran Torino should have no problem soaring past the $100M mark to become one of Eastwood’s most popular films. His other big earners include Baby with $100.4M (about $115M at today’s prices), 1992’s Unforgiven with $101.2M ($173M today), and 1993’s In the Line of Fire with $102.3M ($175M today). Clint pics have historically had strong legs.The wedding comedy Bride Wars opened in second place pulling in an estimated $21.5M for Fox. Starring Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway as best friends whose weddings get scheduled on the same day, the PG-rated pic averaged a solid $6,665 from 3,226 playdates. It was the widest of the four new films opening or expanding into wide release this weekend. Bride skewed heavily female as women made up a sizable 80% of the audience. The film played to a broad age group though as 52% of the crowd was under 25. Studios often release female-skewing films in January since the football playoffs make males harder to reach.Fox generated an opening similar to the one it enjoyed last January with another wedding-related comedy. 27 Dresses starring Katherine Heigl bowed to $23M and a $7,526 average over the three-day portion of the Martin Luther King holiday frame in 2008 on its way to $76.8M. Reviews for the $30M-budgeted Bride Wars were poor, but ticket buyers instead responded to the starpower, premise, and comedy.Universal’s supernatural thriller The Unborn was an overachiever this weekend surging past expectations to score a $21.1M opening, according to estimates. Creeping into 2,357 theaters, the PG-13 fright flick scared up a superb $8,950 average. The debut was on par with producer Rogue Pictures’ horror hit from last summer The Strangers which also exceeded pre-release forecasts during its launch which resulted in a $21M weekend and $8,515 average. Rogue was just purchased by Relativity Media.Unborn benefitted from being the first horror film of the new year so competition was minimal. Past terrorfests that found success in early January include 2006’s Hostel which debuted to $19.6M and the prior year’s White Noise which bowed to $24.1M. A slick and creepy marketing campaign plus a marketplace filled with old leftovers gave fans a reason to come out and see something new and scary. Teens and young adults made up the bulk of the audience with 75% of the crowd being under 25. Females made up 55%. Unborn kicked off a new year’s feast for horror fans who will soon be attacked by My Bloody Valentine 3D next weekend, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans on the following weekend, The Uninvited on the frame after that, and a new Friday the 13th next month on Friday the 13th.Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston, and the 22 dogs that played the title character of Marley &amp; Me dropped to fourth after two weeks on top and grossed an estimated $11.4M. Down a steep 53%, the Fox release upped its total to $123.7M putting it at number 17 on the list of top-grossing releases from 2008. Brad Pitt was one step behind at number five with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button which collected an estimated $9.5M, off 49%, for a $94.3M cume for Paramount.Tumbling 58% was Adam Sandler’s Bedtime Stories which took in $8.6M for Disney, according to estimates, raising the sum to $97.2M. Operation Valkyrie was in effect at number seven with an estimated $6.7M, down 53%, lifting the cume for Tom Cruise and his eyepatch to $71.5M. Yet another star-driven film, Jim Carrey’s comedy Yes Man, followed with an estimated $6.2M, dropping 56%. Total for Warner Bros. is now $89.4M.Sony released the marital faith-based drama Not Easily Broken on a small scale but was met with solid results in ninth place. The PG-13 film grossed an estimated $5.6M from only 724 theaters for a terrific $7,735 average. Budgeted at just $5M, Broken played to an audience of mature women. Females made up 70% of the crowd while 69% was over the age of 30. The Morris Chestnut starrer is an adaptation of the book of the same name by pastor and author T.D. Jakes who has built up a loyal following in the African American community over the years.Rounding out the top ten was Will Smith’s odd drama Seven Pounds which crumbled by 61% to an estimated $3.9M for a cume of $66.8M for Sony. The jellyfish flick will end the superstar’s streak of eight consecutive $100M+ blockbusters which began back in 2002.Numerous Golden Globe contenders in the Drama categories continued to tout their nominations in their advertising in hopes of luring in more audiences. Best Picture nominee Slumdog Millionaire was number 11 for the weekend with an estimated $3.7M, off 21%, for a total of $34.1M for Fox Searchlight. Miramax’s Doubt which scored four acting nominations including Best Actress for Meryl Streep fell a troubling 50% to an estimated $2.5M lifting the sum to $22.9M.The Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet pic Revolutionary Road, a nominee for Best Picture, expanded from 38 to 135 sites and grossed an estimated $1.4M for a solid $10,667 average.

Starring Best Actor nominee Sean Penn, the gay rights pic upped its total to $19.1M. Fox Searchlight expanded The Wrestler starring rival Best Actor nominee Mickey Rourke from 18 to 60 sites. The New Jersey-set tale took in an estimated $874,000 for a strong $14,567 average putting the sum at $2.8M. Frank Langella is also up for the Actor prize with his film Frost/Nixon which dropped 35% to an estimated $912,000 for a $7.7M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $123.3M which was up a healthy 25% from last year when The Bucket List expanded wide into the top spot with $19.4M; and up a superb 36% from 2006 when Stomp the Yard opened at number one with $21.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"BAFTA, BBC, godzilla, Rocketman, twilight, rt, The, universe, TCA","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Clint-Races-to-1-with-Gran-Torino"},{"id":"47509142508504","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Marley Still #1 and Races Past $100M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Marley Still #1 and Races Past $100MTop 10 stays virtually the same for second week.by Gitesh Pandya | January 4, 2009 |  CommentsMoviegoers caught up on those holiday films they didn’t see over Christmasweekend as the top seven films finished in the exact same slots as last weekendwith the dog drama Marley &amp; Meleading the pack once again and smashing through the $100M mark too.

The holiday comedy Four Christmases led the way with a stellar number one opening while sophomores Bolt and Twilight were in a virtual tie for second place with nearly identical grosses. The top ten films grossed $154M – the best tally for the turkey holiday in eight years.Superstars Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon contributed their producing and acting talents to Four Christmases and were rewarded with a potent debut grossing an estimated $31.7M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a fantastic $46.7M over five days since opening on Wednesday. The New Line pic was distributed by Warner Bros. and averaged a stellar $9,571 from 3,310 sites over the three-day period. The PG-13 film about a couple that must attend yuletide events at the homes of each of their divorced parents was just the type of comedic entertainment that moviegoers were in the mood for during the long holiday weekend. Ticket buyers ignored the bad reviews and instead responded to the starpower, the unique premise, and the comedy. Look for both actors to add another $100M blockbuster to their resumes in the coming weeks.Jumping up one notch from last weekend, Disney’s animated flick Bolt posted a slight uptick in ticket sales for a solid holiday performance. The PG-rated toon grossed an estimated $26.6M inching up 1% from its $26.2M bow last week. Though the canine star opened weaker than expected, it made up for that shortfall by generating a sensational second weekend take. After ten days, Bolt has grossed $66.9M. The studio is hoping that it will continue to see strong legs since there will be no new kidpics released over the next two weekends.Last weekend’s top film Twilight experienced a hefty decline as expected and ranked third with an estimated $26.4M. Falling 62%, the Summit release has now banked a stellar $119.7M which is quite an impressive sum for a no-star film budgeted at only $37M. The PG-13 film averaged a sturdy $7,699 from 3,425 locations.James Bond was still a popular draw for movie fans over the holiday weekend with Quantum of Solace dropping only 27% to an estimated $19.5M. That put Sony’s domestic total at a robust $142.1M after 17 days which is 23% ahead of Casino Royale at the same point in its run and 18% ahead of 2002’s Die Another Day. The overseas total for Quantum vaulted to $340.1M lifting the global haul to a stunning $482.2M.Fox’s big-budget historical epic Australia debuted with an estimated $14.8M over three days and $20M across five days. The Hugh Jackman-Nicole Kidman film opened in 2,642 locations and averaged a respectable $5,607. But given the cost of the massive production (the studio kicked in $78M of the $130M budget) the Baz Luhrmann-directed film will need strong legs and spectacular international grosses in order to break even. According to studio research, 65% of the audience was over 25 while 52% was female. Competition for adult audiences was fierce over the holiday weekend with many choosing to spend their dollars on Four Christmases and Quantum of Solace while young women were still distracted by Twilight. Reviews were mixed for Australia and the running time of 165 minutes meant fewer showtimes per day.Paramount ranked sixth with its toon entry Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa which slipped only 7% to an estimated $14.5M boosting the overall cume to $159.5M. The sequel’s final domestic haul looks like it will end up a bit below the $193.2M of its 2005 predecessor.Delivering a seventh-place debut was Jason Statham’s action sequel Transporter 3 which grossed an estimated $12.3M over the weekend and $18.5M over the extended holiday period. The franchise showed signs of age as the five-day bow failed to match the $20.5M four-day debut of Transporter 2 which launched over the slower Labor Day holiday frame. The third chapter in the series played in 2,626 locations and averaged a decent $4,695 over the Friday-to-Sunday span. Fox released the first two pics in the franchise while Lionsgate distributed this new chapter.Universal’s hit comedy Role Models dropped by 28% to an estimated $5.3M giving the Seann William Scott-Paul Rudd pic a solid $57.9M to date.Specialty films filled up the next three positions on the charts. The Holocaust drama The Boy in the Striped Pajamas expanded again from 406 to 582 locations and grossed an estimated $1.7M this weekend. The Miramax release averaged a mild $2,904 but raised its sum to $5.2M.Sean Penn’s highly praised performance in the Focus Features release Milk helped to deliver the weekend’s best average thanks to an estimated $1.38M from only 36 theaters. Averaging a sizzling $38,361, the R-rated film about the first openly gay elected official in America won rave reviews from critics and has generated Oscar buzz for Penn who hopes to score his fourth Best Actor nod from the Academy this decade and fifth overall. The Gus Van Sant-directed film’s five-day total since opening on Wednesday is $1.9M. On Friday, Milk will expand to nearly 100 theaters and will add more runs on December 12.Danny Boyle’s Slumdog Millionaire continued its impressive limited run widening from 32 to 49 theaters for a weekend gross of $1.37M, according to estimates, putting it a hair behind in eleventh place. Cume is now $3.6M. The Fox Searchlight title averaged a potent $27,898 and will add more theaters each week in December.The top ten films grossed an estimated $154.1M which was up 10% from last year’s Thanksgiving frame when Enchanted opened in the top spot with $34.4M over three days; and up 10% from 2006’s holiday when Happy Feet remained at number one with $37M in its second weekend.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"fast, One, Christmas, Dates","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Four-Christmases-has-a-lot-to-be-thankful-for-this-weekend"},{"id":"47509142469587","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers So Into You","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers So Into YouCoraline does decent business.by Gitesh Pandya | February 8, 2009 |  CommentsThe new romantic comedy He’s Just Not That Into You featuring anall-star cast including Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck was the top choice withNorth American moviegoers.

Taken has taken in $53.4M in its first ten days, but willface direct competition this Friday when Sony’s bank thriller TheInternational debuts.The 3D stop-motion animated film Coraline openedimpressively in third place with an estimated $16.3M. Focus averaged a solid$7,105 from 2,299 theaters and proved once again how moviegoers are rushing outto theaters and paying those higher ticket prices to see films in threedimensions. With helmer Henry Selick not being a household name, the PG-rated Coraline instead was promoted as being from the director of The NightmareBefore Christmas which over the last decade and a half has become a modernclassic spawning recent 3D re-releases around Halloween time. With thePresidents’ Day holiday next weekend and many schools taking winter breaks inFebruary, the Dakota Fanning-voiced pic should be able to enjoy a healthy run inthe weeks ahead.

The new comedy Confessions of a Shopaholic enjoyed an impressive bow as well while the banking thriller The International saw a lukewarm launch. Most holdovers remained very strong as Valentine’s Day falling on the prime moviegoing day of Saturday gave a big boost to multiplex traffic.Overall, the Top 20 hauled in a stunning $211M in ticket sales over the Friday-to-Monday period making for the biggest Presidents’ Day session on record. And just like last month’s record Martin Luther King holiday frame, this weekend saw more business at theaters than last year’s Thanksgiving holiday frame.[rtimage]MapID=1200552&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fans flocked to theaters to see the updated Friday the 13th spending an estimated $45.2M on the horror flick over the four-day holiday weekend. Produced by New Line Cinema and Paramount Pictures, the R-rated pic was released by Warner Bros. in 3,105 sites and averaged a sensational $14,560 per site oer the Friday-to-Monday span. Paramount released the first eight films in the lucrative franchise’s history from 1980 to 1989 and will handle international distribution on the new Friday. It was the biggest opening in history for a pure horror film and the best for any R-rated film since last June’s Wanted starring Angelina Jolie bowed to $50.9M. The Friday-to-Sunday portion generated a meaty $40.7M.Produced for a mere $19M by Michael Bay’s Platinum Dunes, Friday the 13th followed the company’s other successful reboots of classic horror hits like 2003’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and 2005’s The Amityville Horror which debuted to $28.1M and $23.5M, respectively. The new Jason pic also powered well ahead of the $26.4M opening of 2007’s Halloween remake by Rob Zombie. Friday‘s release on Friday the 13th helped to make this an event film for genre fans and young adult audiences. The opening day generated a killer $19.4M worth of business, Saturday fell 26% to $14.3M, Sunday dropped 51% to $7M, and Monday is estimated to slide by 36% to $4.5M. Bay is already developing a redo of A Nightmare on Elm Street scheduled for release next year with New Line co-producing and Warners distributing.[rtimage]MapID=1192140&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Following its fantastic opening, the relationship comedy He’s Just Not That Into You dropped to second with an estimated $23.4M over four days boosting the 11-day total to a robust $58.8M. Like Friday, You was produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. The ensemble hit should make its way to at least $90M domestically and could leap past the $100M mark too.The sleeper action hit Taken was close behind in third place taking in an estimated $22.2M. With the three-day portion off a scant 8% to $19M, it was the strongest third weekend gross for any film since The Dark Knight narrowly edging out the $18.8M that Quantum of Solace took in during its third frame. Taken has now swiped a stunning $80.9M in just 18 days with much more still to come. The Liam Neeson hit could crack the $100M mark next weekend and will challenge Gran Torino and Paul Blart: Mall Cop for bragging rights to top grossing wide release of the year. All three have shot well beyond expectations.[rtimage]MapID=1193252&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The 3D stop-motion film Coraline delivered a terrific sophomore frame grossing an estimated $19.1M over four days with the Friday-to-Sunday part sliding a mere 9% from its opening frame. Focus has banked an impressive $39.4M in only 11 days and should be headed north of $75M. The PG-rated film featuring the voice of Dakota Fanning has easily been the top choice for families this month.Striding into fifth place was the comedy Confessions of a Shopaholic which bowed to an estimated $17.3M. Based on the best-selling book of the same name, the Buena Vista release averaged a solid $6,902 from 2,507 theaters. The PG-rated film was slammed by critics but connected with its target audience of young women as a whopping 74% of the audience was female. Shopaholic played to a broad age range with 51% being age 25 and under. It was the thirteenth film this year to open north of the $15M mark. The three-day bow was $15.1M.[rtimage]MapID=1191984&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Yet another PG-rated winner followed. The Kevin James smash Paul Blart: Mall Cop saw its weekend take climb to an estimated $13.9M thanks in part to a see-it-again campaign aimed at moviegoers hitting cinemas over the Washington-Lincoln holiday frame. Sony broke the $100M mark on Friday after 29 days of release and the total now sits at $112.7M. James has now outgrossed the latest comedies from many A-listers like Jim Carrey’s Yes Man ($96.4M), Will Ferrell’s Step Brothers ($100.5M), and both of Adam Sandler’s releases from last year Bedtime Stories ($109M) and You Don’t Mess With the Zohan ($100M).The studio’s other PG-rated bumbling crime-fighter film The Pink Panther 2 dropped to seventh with an estimated $10.8M and enjoyed a good hold thanks to kids having extra time off. But with $24.1M in 11 days, the Steve Martin pic is running 48% behind the pace of its 2006 predecessor which collected $46.5M in the same timeframe on its way to a $82.2M final.[rtimage]MapID=1190694&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The box office has been churning out hits consistently in 2009. Every weekend this year has been up versus the corresponding frame from 2008 with the exception of Super Bowl weekend which was just a hair behind last year’s. Seven wide openers from 2009 have crossed the $50M mark compared to just four last year at this point. The top five films so far this year have collectively grossed an eye-popping $435M which is well ahead of the $329M from last year’s five-pack at this same point in time.Debuting in eighth place with a moderate bow was the banking thriller The International which grossed $10.7M over four days from 2,364 locations for a respectable $4,526 average. Starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts, the R-rated action drama earned mixed reviews and played to an older male audience. The Sony film faced a major challenge for that crowd from the durable hit Taken which grossed nearly twice as much this weekend. Produced for $50M, The International drew an audience that was 59% male and 66% over the age of 30.[rtimage]MapID=1202802&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fox Searchlight’s award-winning Slumdog Millionaire spent its seventh weekend in the top ten and twelfth session in the Top 12. The Danny Boyle hit grossed an estimated $8.7M over four days boosting the stellar cume to $88.1M. Slumdog should be just shy of the $100M mark come Oscar night when it competes in nine categories with its ten nominations. The sci-fi actioner Push followed with an estimated $7.9M lifting the cume for Summit up to $20.3M in ten days. A $30M final may result.Oscar nominees for Best Picture did their best to bring in ticket sales as their time as ‘contenders’ nears its end. The Reader led the way with an estimated $2.5M for a $19.5M sum for The Weinstein Co. Dropping to an estimated $1.9M was Paramount’s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button which lifted the domestic tally to $122.5M. The Sean Penn vehicle Milk fell to an estimated $1.1M giving Focus $26.7M to date.

Holdovers were mixed and the only other new release landed with a soft thud.Taking his rightful place atop the box office charts, Tyler Perry’s Madea Goes to Jail ruled the roost this weekend bringing in a stunning $41.2M, according to estimates, for a per screen average of $20,236. Perry’s fans have obviously been hungering for another round of Madea and they came out in droves to see her. Madea Goes to Jail replaces Madea’s Family Reunion as Perry’s biggest opening weekend gross. That film opened three years ago to a $30M bow and $13,688 average. Perry’s last two films have been relative disappointments (relative only within the Perry universe) but Madea has set him back on track. In fact, Madea Goes to Jail this weekend alone has made more money than Perry’s last film The Family That Preys, did in its entire run late last year, when it finished with $37.1M.[rtimage]MapID=1199053&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=15&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Continuing its impressive run and refusing to let go of second place was the Liam Neeson action-thriller Taken fell 40% from last weekend’s three-day totals to an estimated $11.4M bringing its cume to within a hair of the century club at $95.1M. The family film Coraline came in third this weekend, dropping a small 25% for an estimated weekend take of $11M. Its cume now stands at $53.4M for Focus Features.Fourth place belonged to the chick lit pic He’s Just Not That Into You which fell 56% from last weekend’s Valentine’s Day fueled total to $8.5M, according to estimates. Its cume now stands at $70.1M with the century club still a possibility.Fifth place belonged to multiple Oscar hopeful Slumdog Millionaire which saw its gross increase by 10% from last weekend to an estimated $8M. Its total after nearly four months in theaters is $98M and could grow much higher if it takes home the coveted Best Picture Oscar tonight.[rtimage]MapID=1198041&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=17&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Crashing and burning into sixth place was last weekend’s champ Friday the 13th which fell an astounding 80% to $7.8M. A big drop was expected as fans of the genre rushed out on opening weekend, but this drop gives Friday the 13th the distinction of being one of the top 10 worst second weekend drops for a wide release in history. Its total stands at $55M with a final gross somewhere in the $65-70M range. While there are two more Friday the 13ths in this year (much too soon for a sequel to hit) the only Friday the 13th in 2010 is in August, the perfect time for an end of summer horror film.The second chick lit flick on the charts landed in seventh this weekend as Confessions of a Shopaholic took in an estimated $7M of consumer dollars bringing its cume to $27.6M. A drop of 53% from last weekend does not bode well for the Disney release. Look for a final total in the $40-45M range.[rtimage]MapID=1191984&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A trio of Sony releases closes out the top 10 this weekend. In eighth place was arguably the biggest surprise hit so far this season, Paul Blart: Mall Cop which fell only 36% from last weekend to an estimated $7M. Its total now stands at a terrific $121.3M. Opening poorly in ninth place was the high school not-a-cheerleading movie Fired Up! The movie starring two guys who haven’t been in high school in about 10 years took in $6M this weekend, according to estimates, for a per screen average of $3,315. And rounding out the top 10 was The International in its second weekend. The banking thriller took in $4.5M this weekend bringing its cume to a disappointing $17M. Look for a final total in the $25M range.Three of the other four Best Picture nominees added theaters this weekend and all saw their grosses rise slightly from last weekend. The Reader grossed an estimated $2.8M this weekend, (up 25% from last weekend) bringing its total to $23.1M.

Frost/Nixon saw its weekend take rise 31% from last weekend, raking in $678,000 according to estimates, bringing its cume to $17M.

Lionsgate also performed well with its new presidential flick W. which landed in fourth allowing three new releases to post averages north of $5,000 each. The frame’s fourth new player was a dud – Summit’s teen comedy Sex Drive found few takers. Overall, the marketplace remained ahead of last year’s pace but was about even with 2006’s solid October session.\nEnjoying its first number one hit in seven months, Fox brought in solid sales for its stylish video game-inspired action pic Max Payne which grossed an estimated $18M to lead the weekend race. The PG-13 film attacked 3,376 theaters and averaged a commendable $5,332 per site. Males made up 64% of the audience for the testosterone pic which surprised nobody. Only three films this fall have opened better – Beverly Hills Chihuahua ($29.3M), Eagle Eye ($29.2M), and Burn After Reading ($19.1M). The bow was a bit ahead of the $15.5M debut for another video game actioner from mid-October, Doom starring The Rock from 2005.\n\n\n\nFor Fox, Payne came as a badly needed hit following a string of seven films that all opened to under $12M, with many debuting poorly with less than $8M. It was the best opening for the studio since June’s The Happening ($30.5M) and its first top spot debut since March’s Horton Hears a Who ($45M) which remains 2008’s biggest non-summer opener. The rest of the year’s slate for Fox includes the risky Nicole Kidman-Hugh Jackman epic Australia on Thanksgiving weekend, the Keanu Reeves sci-fi actioner ","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"comic, thriller, thriller, nightmare, quibi, Film, new, Ghostbusters, Geographic, Comic, 24, venice, Studios, drama","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Max-feels-no-Payne-at-No-1"},{"id":"47509144351720","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Worst Box Office in 5 Years","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Worst Box Office in 5 YearsCage's action flick takes an unimpressive first place.by Gitesh Pandya | September 8, 2008 |  CommentsMoviegoers found almost nothing worth paying money for at North American multiplexes as the top ten films at the box office slumped to their lowest gross in five years giving the new fall movie season a disastrous start. Nicolas Cage’s latest thriller Bangkok Dangerous suffered one of the worst action openings ever for the Oscar-winning actor, but thanks to a sluggish marketplace it was good enough to claim first place. Summer holdovers performed relatively well with five pics in the top ten dropping by less than 40%, but most wide releases crawled to averages of less than $2,300 as theaters struggled to find ticket buyers.Bowing to only $7.8M, according to estimates, Bangkok Dangerous enjoyed a less-than-spectacular number one debut with a lackluster $2,943 average from 2,650 locations. The R-rated hitman pic gave Cage his second worst opening for an action film since becoming a major player in that genre with 1996’s The Rock. Over that twelve-year span, only last year’s Next posted a weaker debut for an action film with just $7.1M and a $2,618 average. Reviews were poor and Lionsgate’s marketing push was moderate at best.The weekend after Labor Day is typically one of the slowest frames of the year. With students back in school and a new football season starting, studios generally avoid opening any strong films at this time which in turns helps the box office slow down. But this year with a major tropical storm hitting the east coast and election hoopla getting bigger after the political conventions, moviegoing just was not a priority for people. The top ten films grossed a dismal $47.6M making it the worst showing since this very same weekend in 2003 when the top ten stumbled to $46.2M. The Top 20 grossed $59.7M that year and is estimated to reach $61M this weekend. Factor in ticket price increases and less stubs were definitely sold this time around. Final grosses to be reported on Monday will show if this entire frame will come in lower than that sluggish session from five years ago when David Spade’s Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star led the chart with only $6.7M in its debut weekend. Bangkok also delivered the smallest gross for a number one film since Dickie.Following its three-week rule of the box office, the war comedy Tropic Thunder retreated back to a close second place finish with an estimated $7.5M dipping only 35%. After its fourth weekend, the Paramount release has collected a solid $96.8M and should cross the century mark next weekend. Sony’s comedy The House Bunny climbed up one notch to third with an estimated $5.9M in its third session dipping only 29%. Total stands at $37M.The Dark Knight dropped only 34% to an estimated $5.7M and raised its amazing North American cume to $512.2M. Overseas, the Warner Bros. sensation raked in an estimated $11.8M boosting the international tally to $437.2M which allowed the worldwide gross to soar to a staggering $949.4M. The Christian Bale-Heath Ledger showdown now sits at number six among all-time global blockbusters sandwiched right between last summer’s megahits Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End ($961M) and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ($938M).Don Cheadle’s political thriller Traitor held up well in its second weekend dropping 41% to an estimated $4.7M to push the 12-day tally to $17.7M. The Overture Films release should finish off in the vicinity of $30M. The Vin Diesel actioner Babylon A.D. fell 58% to an estimated $4M for Fox putting the ten-day total at $17.2M. A $25M final should result.Another macho action pic Death Race followed with an estimated $3.6M, off 43%, giving Universal $29.8M to date. The spoof comedy Disaster Movie slipped 44% in its sophomore session to an estimated $3.3M. Lionsgate has seen just $10.9M in sales and should conclude its run with a mere $19M or so.Two successful summer comedy leftovers rounded out the top ten. Mamma Mia! eased 36% to an estimated $2.7M boosting the stellar domestic cume to $136.3M allowing it to enter the top ten list of summer blockbusters. Universal’s singing sensation smashed through the $400M worldwide mark this weekend thanks to a stellar international frame that saw an estimated $15M. That was enough to push the overseas sum to $280.1M and the global gross to an eye-popping $416M. Mamma is now Universal’s top-grossing film of the year both domestically and worldwide beating out the studio’s many action offerings like The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, Wanted, and The Incredible Hulk which all cost more to produce.Sony’s stoner comedy Pineapple Express took in an estimated $2.4M, down 32%, and has grossed $84.2M thus far.The top ten films grossed a pathetic estimate of $47.6M over the weekend which was down 23% from last year when 3:10 to Yuma opened in the top spot with $14M; and off 3% from 2006 when The Covenant debuted at number one with $9M in its opening frame.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Nickelodeon, ESPN, Golden, Comic, harry","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Worst-Box-Office-in-5-Years"},{"id":"47509144337376","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Zac Beats Zack for #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Zac Beats Zack for #1 SpotAmateur musical theater performers defeat amateur pornographers.by Gitesh Pandya | November 2, 2008 |  CommentsDespite being clobbered by Halloween on Friday, Disney’s smash hit kidpic High School Musical 3 once again led the North American box office in its second weekend winning the frame by a comfortable margin. The squeaky clean teens were followed by a trio of R-rated films that fought fiercely over the runnerup spot. Final grosses to be reported on Monday could lead to a change in the standings, but based on official studio estimates Kevin Smith’s raunchy new comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno debuted in second, the horror sequel Saw V slipped a notch to third, and Clint Eastwood’s missing child drama Changeling starring Angelina Jolie expanded nationally and placed fourth with the best average in the top ten. With the Pumpkin holiday keeping folks away from multiplexes on Friday and the lack of any breakout new releases, overall ticket sales took a nosedive with the top ten pulling in just over $70M falling 39% from last weekend and dropping 41% from a year ago.Moviegoers couldn’t stay away from the singing and dancing students of High School Musical 3 making the franchise flick the top movie in the land with an estimated $15M over the weekend. Down a steep 64%, the Zac Efron pic pushed its stellar ten-day total to $61.8M. Disney has now ruled the box office over four of the last five weekends thanks to its one-two punch of G-rated family films HSM3 and Beverly Hills Chihuahua which still remained in the top ten this weekend.Theatrical business was on a rollercoaster ride this weekend thanks to Halloween falling on a Friday this year. Since Musical‘s audience of young children and parents are the ones most affected by trick-or-treating, the film got hammered on Friday tumbling an eye-popping 90% from its opening day to just $1.7M. With those holiday activities out of the way, sales surged over 380% on Saturday to $8.2M and the studio is projecting Sunday to fall by 37% to an estimated $5.1M. Compared to last weekend, the Saturday and Sunday takes depreciated by roughly 46% each, a reasonably good performance for a frontloaded sequel in its sophomore session.With Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa launching on Friday, competition for kids will get tough. Still, HSM3 may find its way to $90-100M domestically. Overseas, the Wildcats pulled in another $25.9M boosting the international tally to $85M and the worldwide cume to a stunning $146.8M. With a production budget of just $13M, it’s only a matter of time before the Mouse House puts a fourth installment into production, regardless of cast or story.Three distributors battled over second place this weekend and the final results may come down to how accurate their projected Saturday-to-Sunday declines end up being. Based on official estimates released by the companies, those drops for the moment stand at 25% for Zack and Miri Make a Porno from The Weinstein Co., 34% for Lionsgate’s Saw V, and a more understandable 40% for Universal’s Changeling.Kevin Smith’s Zack opened with an estimated $10.7M from 2,735 theaters for a decent $3,906 average. The Seth Rogen-Elizabeth Banks comedy about best friends that make a dirty movie together to earn some quick cash ended up performing much like Smith’s other R-rated comedies released wide. Clerks II bowed to $10.1M and a $4,680 average in 2006 while 2001’s Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back debuted to $11M and a $3,985 average. The casting of Rogen failed to pump the numbers up to those seen by the actor’s many films for Judd Apatow which often flirt with the $30M mark. Reviews for Zack were generally positive.The torture extravaganza Saw V got hacked by 66% in its second weekend and grossed an estimated $10.1M. The Lionsgate release has now banked a solid $45.8M in ten days. The weekend drop was skewed by the Halloween effect on Friday as Saturday declined by 58% from the previous weekend while Sunday is estimated to fall by 54%. The aging franchise is still showing signs of erosion as the cume is the lowest ten-day start for the series since the first Saw did $35.4M in 2004. Ten-day cumes for the other chapters include $60.1M for Saw II, $59.4M for Saw III, and $50.4M for Saw IV. Halloween fell within that period for all five films. Look for Saw V to finish in the neighborhood of $55M which should still make it a profitable piece of intellectual property.Universal expanded its Angelina Jolie vehicle Changeling from 15 to 1,850 theaters and grossed an estimated $9.4M. That amounted to a solid $5,085 average, the best among all wide releases. Directed by Clint Eastwood, the true story of a woman in search of her missing boy in the 1920s attracted mixed reviews which may have dampened sales with the target audience of older adults. Total including last week’s limited run is now $10.1M. The performance was somewhat similar to the expansion for the Oscar-winning filmmaker’s Mystic River from October 2003 which also went national in its second weekend with $10.4M from 1,467 sites. That film earned better reviews and a stronger $7,120 average which at today’s ticket prices would amount to roughly $8,300. Changeling‘s numbers also resembled those of Eastwood’s Flags of Our Fathers which debuted to $10.2M and a $5,461 average just two years ago in October 2006. Though not generating huge numbers, the former Dirty Harry is dependable when he hits the multiplexes with a new drama. He next pops up on screen this December in Gran Torino which he also directed.Freestyle Releasing was the most aggressive distributor with Saturday-to-Sunday declines this weekend projecting a slim 13% dip for its horror title The Haunting of Molly Hartley resulting in a reported three-day estimate of $6M. The PG-13 fright flick about a teenage girl hunted by the devil opened with a mild $2,262 average from 2,652 locations. Final grosses to be reported on Monday should see a smaller gross, however its fifth place standing is secure.The fall season’s second biggest hit Beverly Hills Chihuahua followed in sixth with an estimated $4.7M, off only 31%, for a cume of $84.1M for Disney. Collecting an estimated $4M, down just 34% in its third session, was The Secret Life of Bees which has upped its sum to $25.3M for Fox Searchlight.Fox’s action drama Max Payne fell 53% to an estimated $3.7M pushing the total to $35.6M. Paramount and DreamWorks held up well once again with Eagle Eye, the fall’s top-grossing flick, with an estimated $3.4M, down 33%, for a $92.5M cume. The $100M mark is well within reach for Mr. LaBeouf. The Edward Norton-Colin Farrell cop saga Pride and Glory dropped 48% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $3.3M. After ten days, the total for the Warner Bros.-New Line Cinema pic is a disappointing $11.6M.Guy Ritchie’s crime thriller RocknRolla failed to draw much of a crowd in its first weekend of wide release. Expanding from 19 to 826 playdates, the R-rated pic grossed an estimated $1.8M for a weak $2,119 average. Cume is a mere $2.4M for the Gerard Butler starrer.The top ten films grossed an estimated $70.3M which was down 41% from last year when American Gangster opened in the top spot with $43.6M; and off 35% from 2006 when Borat debuted at number one with $26.5M.While the North American box office took a big hit this weekend, overseas action was ignited by what could be the top-grossing global blockbuster for the rest of 2008 – the new James Bond adventure Quantum of Solace. Daniel Craig’s second turn as 007 opened to a colossal $24.8M in the United Kingdom breaking the record for that market’s largest three-day opening weekend edging out Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Quantum‘s launch was 35% bigger than Casino Royale‘s from two years ago indicating how firmly engaged audiences are now to Craig in the iconic role in this post-Pierce era. France opened to a stellar $10.5M while Sweden bowed to $2.3M, both bigger than the last Bond.Quantum of Solace makes its big global premiere this coming weekend when it invades 57 additional markets for what undoubtedly will be a massive worldwide assault. North America was originally scheduled to be part of that debut. But when Warner Bros. moved Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince from November to next July, Sony pushed the domestic launch of Bond back by a week to November 14 to move it closer to the lucrative Thanksgiving holiday. All 007 installments since the 1990s were released a week before the Turkey holiday with one exception – Tomorrow Never Dies which opened day and date against Titanic on December 19, 1997.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"nightmare, Amazon, Premium, Sundance, Comedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Zac-Beats-Zack-for-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509144344548","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Chihuahua is Top Dog","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Chihuahua is Top DogDisney's pooch reigns supreme at the weekend box office.by Gitesh Pandya | October 5, 2008 |  CommentsThis weekend a jam-packed slate of eight new films opening or expanding nationwide flooded the multiplexes but it was a pampered little dog that ticket buyers wanted turning Disney’s family comedy Beverly Hills Chihuahua into the box office king. Younger-skewing movies ruled the charts while an assortment of niche pics targeting specific audiences found some success elsewhere in the top ten. Three new films opening in over 1,000 theaters each failed to even make the top ten proving that the marketplace can only handle so much content. But the variety of product did lead ticket sales well ahead of year-ago levels starting October on a positive note.Moviegoers just couldn’t resist talking animals and the Disney brand name as Beverly Hills Chihuahua delivered a powerful number one opening with an estimated $29M over the Friday-to-Sunday period. Averaging a stellar $9,020 from 3,215 locations, the PG-rated tale of a rich dog lost in Mexico connected with kids and parents and posted the best opening for a kidpic since June’s WALL•E launched to $63.1M. It was the second best family film opening ever in the September-October corridor trailing only Will Smith’s Shark Tale which debuted to $47.6M in October 2004. Also helping the Mouse House this weekend was the lack of good family movies over the past couple of months. The road ahead looks rosy as few options for children stand in the way of Chihuahua over the next month. Between now and the November 7 launch of the DreamWorks sequel Madagascar Escape 2 Africa there is High School Musical 3, but that belongs to the Disney empire.Shia LaBeouf might be on his way to scoring another career $100M+ blockbuster as his latest actioner Eagle Eye enjoyed a good hold in its second frame. Last weekend’s top film dropped 39% to an estimated $17.7M and lifted the film’s ten-day cume to a solid $54.6M. Paramount and its soon-to-be-ex-wife DreamWorks should find their way to $95-100M.Despite Eagle Eye‘s presence, Sony was still able to connect with teens and young adults with its comedy Nick &amp; Norah’s Infinite Playlist which debuted in third place with an estimated $12M. Playing in 2,421 playdates, the PG-13 romantic comedy averaged a healthy $4,957. According to studio research, 55% of the audience was under 21 while 62% was female. With Chihuahua skewing very young and most other new releases aiming for adults over 30, Playlist was able to reach a crowd that had few viable options this weekend. The modest $13M budget should allow it to become a moneymaker too.Richard Gere and Diane Lane suffered the worst drop in the top ten with their romance Nights in Rodanthe which fell 45% to an estimated $7.4M. With $25.1M in the bank, the Warner Bros. release should reach about $40M. By comparison, the actors charmed $52.8M from movie fans in 2002 with Unfaithful which amounts to about $65M at today’s ticket prices.The Ed Harris-directed Western Appaloosa expanded nationally after a two-week limited run and enjoyed a respectable take of an estimated $5M from 1,045 theaters. Averaging $4,794 per location, the Warner Bros. title showed that there is still an audience for this classic genre of films. Cume is $5.6M. Samuel L. Jackson’s thriller Lakeview Terrace slipped only 35% to an estimated $4.5M in its third frame boosting the 17-day total to $32.1M for Sony.Focus followed with Burn After Reading which grossed an estimated $4.08M, off just 34%, for a $51.6M cume. The Christian-themed hit Fireproof was close behind with an estimated $4.07M dropping a reasonable 41% in the second weekend. Budgeted at a mere $500,000, the Samuel Goldwyn release has captured a solid $12.5M in ten days and could go on to finish with an impressive $20-25M.Vivendi Entertainment opened its first wide release with the David Zucker-directed comedy An American Carol which grossed an estimated $3.8M for a ninth place finish. Playing in 1,639 locations in the United States, the PG-13 film about a Michael Moore-type filmmaker who is visited by three ghosts who show him the true meaning of America averaged only $2,325 per site. Kevin Farley, Kelsey Grammer, and Leslie Nielsen star and reviews were not very positive. Carol opens in Canada this Friday.Rounding out the top ten and scoring the second best average on that list was the Bill Maher doc Religulous which collected an estimated $3.5M from only 502 theaters for a potent $6,972 average. Directed by Larry Charles (Borat), the R-rated film that explores the merits of organized religion earned generally upbeat reviews for Lionsgate. The last film to open in the top ten in fewer theaters was the Spanish-language immigration drama Under the Same Moon with $2.8M from 266 sites in March.A slew of new releases also debuted outside the top ten with most generating disappointing results. The one film which audiences did actually connect with was the Anne Hathaway drama Rachel Getting Married which scored a sensational $33,667 average from nine theaters after grossing an estimated $303,000 this weekend in its platform bow. The Sony Classics release about a surly young woman who goes back home for her sister’s wedding has been praised by critics and has earned Hathaway plenty of kudos buzz making her, at the moment, one of the frontrunners on Oscar night. Directed by Jonathan Demme, the R-rated pic expands into more markets in the coming weeks.Universal stumbled with its Greg Kinnear drama Flash of Genius which opened in 1,098 locations collecting just $2.3M, according to estimates. With a weak $2,120 average, the tale of an inventor screwed by the auto giants just didn’t make moviegoers want to spend top dollar. Reviews were mixed.Miramax’s new arthouse thriller Blindness was panned by critics and flopped in its nationwide opening. The Julianne Moore pic took in an estimated $2M from 1,690 sites for an embarrassing $1,185 average. The figures only represent the U.S. and not Canada. The Simon Pegg comedy How to Lose Friends and Alienate People attracted few people debuting to an estimated $1.4M. Averaging only $801 from 1,750 theaters, the MGM release saw weak reviews from critics.The top ten films grossed an estimated $91M which was up a robust 44% from last year when The Game Plan remained in the top spot in its second frame with $16.6M; but off 7% from 2006 when The Departed debuted at number one with $26.9M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"IFC, Pirates, Rom-Com, TV, movies, nbcuniversal, school, Yoda, the, Classic, Film, Esquire, King, movies, italian","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Chihuahua-is-Top-Dog"},{"id":"47509146295276","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dark Knight #1 for Fourth Time","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dark Knight #1 for Fourth TimePineapple Express makes a solid debut.by Gitesh Pandya | August 10, 2008 |  CommentsThe unstoppable box office superhero The Dark Knight once again defeated all foes and spent its fourth consecutive weekend at number one becoming the first film in nearly five years to accomplish the fourpeat. With the gold medal going to Batman, Seth Rogen and James Franco shared the silver with their new stoner comedy Pineapple Express which posted a solid five-day debut. The frame’s other new release, the friendship sequelThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2, debuted in fourth with commendable results. Showing signs that the summer box office is coming to an end, the top ten slumped to its lowest tally of the season.Moviegoers once again drove The Dark Knight to the top spot as Warner Bros. grossed an estimated $26M in its fourth weekend to boost the 24-day total to an unbelievable $441.5M. The Caped Crusader continued to reach new milestones. Down only 39%, the superhero sequel shot up to number three on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters and sits behind only Titanic which grossed $600.8M during one theatrical run across 1997 and 1998, andStar Wars which took in $461M from multiple releases over differentdecades.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, ticket prices were much lower during those years and Knight is not likely to match those films in admissions. The new Joker film has sold roughly 62 million stubs which puts it on the same level as 2003’sThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King which grossed $377M and sits at number ten on the all-time list. Coincidentally, the final Frodo pic was the last movie to spend four straight weekends at number one. Mel Gibson’sThe Passion of the Christ hit the top spot over four non-consecutive frames in 2004 including its first three sessions as well as its seventh outing which was the Easter holiday weekend. In today’s crowded marketplace, especially in the summer when even megahits likeIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Transformers, andThe Bourne Ultimatum only spend one week at the top, The Dark Knight‘s feat is truly incredible.The new Batman movie also smashed the $700M barrier in worldwide grosses this weekend. Overseas audiences in 56 markets spent an estimated $35.1M allowing the international total to soar to $263.1M while the global tally climbed to a jaw-dropping $704.6M. Opening against the start of the Beijing Olympics, Knight saw stunning first-place numbers in Korea with $6.9M in five days which already puts it ahead of the lifetime gross ofBatman Begins. The turnout was not as bright in Japan where it bowed in second place to $3M beating the opening of Begins by only 11%.The Dark Knight now looks set to reach the neighborhood of $520M from North America and more than $900M worldwide.The stoner comedy Pineapple Express claimed second place with an opening of $22.4M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a gross of $40.5M since its Wednesday launch. Rated R, the Rogen-Franco buddy pic played in 3,072 theaters and averaged $7,292 per joint for the best average in the top ten. The Judd Apatow production got off to a red hot start with a blistering $12.1M bow on Wednesday driven by older teens and young adults rushing out on the first day to see the much-buzzed-about comedy.Pineapple lost some steam as the weekend came with $7.9M on Friday, a 3% dip to $7.6M on Saturday, and a slim studio-estimated 9% drop on Sunday to $6.9M. Friday-to-Saturday declines are not uncommon during the summer, but when a midweek launch takes some fuel out of the Friday gross, usually some kind of increase will occur on Saturday.&nbsp;&nbsp;The action-comedy basically played out like a highly-anticipated sequel over the five-day period. A whopping 45% of the cume was collected on Wednesday and Thursday matching the ratio of last summer’sHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which grossed $62.6M of its five-day $139.7M tally on those two first days. Non-sequels opening on a Wednesday in July or August generally take in 30-35% in the first two days of play. Produced for $27M,Pineapple looks to be a profitable venture regardless of what kind of legs it displays. Studio research showed that 58% of the audience was male while the CinemaScore grade was a solid A-. Reviews were generally good. Competition will heat up fast with this Wednesday’s launch of rival R-rated action-comedy Tropic Thunderstarring Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruise.The adventure sequel The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor finished in third place in North America, but on a worldwide basis it remained at number one this weekend. Domestically the Universal actioner tumbled 60% to an estimated $16.1M boosting the ten-day tally to $70.7M. That was a much harder fall than the sophomore declines for the first two installments in the Brendan Fraser franchise.The Mummy fell by 43% in 1999 while The Mummy Returns dropped by 51% in 2001. Both of those launched on the first weekend of May to kickoff their respective summer seasons. A final gross of $100-110M could result stateside for the $145M-budgeted pic. Overseas where the film is generating more excitement, Dragon Emperor hauled in a stunning $56.1M this weekend from 49 territories and raised its international cume to $141.1M. The global gross soared to $211.8M with a few big markets like Japan and China still to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;Girlpower drove The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 to a fourth place debut with an estimated $10.8M for the weekend and $19.7M since opening on Wednesday. That represented a healthy 45% increase over the $13.6M five-day bow of the firstSisterhood in June 2005. That film went on to gross a modest $39M for Warner Bros. and found more fans on video. The newPants opened in 2,707 locations and averaged a decent $3,979 per site which was on par with the $3,807 three-day debut average of its predecessor. Reviews were positive.Will Ferrell’s latest comedy Step Brothers dropped 46% in its third weekend to an estimated $8.9M and lifted its total to $80.9M for Sony. The leggy musicalMamma Mia! grossed an estimated $8.1M in its fourth weekend slipping only 36%. Universal’s cume rose to $104M with the Meryl Streep hit becoming the twelfth $100M blockbuster of the summer. The industry had 14 at this point last year. For the Oscar-winning actress, the ABBA songfest marks her fourth time joining the century club. The studio placed its bets on expensive action movies this summer withThe Incredible Hulk, Wanted, plus the Hellboy and Mummy sequels. However, Mamma Mia! could very well fly past all of them if it keeps up its stellar pace and become Universal’s top-grossing film of the year. Overseas, the film grossed another $14.7M and boosted the international sum to $173.4M and the global tally to an amazing $277.4M.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brendan Fraser’s second offering in the top ten, the 3D adventure Journey to the Center of the Earth, folllowed with an estimated $4.9M, off a mere 27%, giving New Line and Warner Bros. $81.8M to date. The Will Smith superhero flickHancock fell 35% to an estimated $3.3M for a $221.7M sum for Sony.Kevin Costner followed with his political comedy Swing Vote which tumbled 50% to an estimated $3.1M in its second term. With only $12M in ten days, look for a disappointing $20M finish. The Pixar toonWALL•E was the oldest resident in the top ten rounding out the list with an estimated $3M in its seventh session. Down 34%, the Disney release has banked $210.1M thus far.The top ten films grossed an estimated $106.6M which was down 20% from last year when Rush Hour 3 opened in the top spot with $49.1M; but up 3% from 2006 when Talladega Nights stayed at number one with $22.1M in its second frame.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"USA, DGA, IFC, Adult, Lifetime, Con, boxoffice, Film, Chilling, streaming, It","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Dark-Knight-1-for-Fourth-Time"},{"id":"47509144347622","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Jackson Debuts Ahead of the Race","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Jackson Debuts Ahead of the RaceLeaving the comedies in his wakeby Gitesh Pandya | September 22, 2008 |  CommentsMoviegoers were in the mood for suspense as the Samuel L. Jackson cop thriller Lakeview Terrace easily topped the North American box office beating out three new comedy openers. Dane Cook’s latest My Best Friend’s Girl disappointed, the animated pic Igor bowed respectably, while the Ricky Gervais starrer Ghost Town played to empty auditoriums. The debuting films joined forces for just $37M in ticket sales falling short of the $63M pumped in last weekend by that frame’s four-pack of new titles. Still, the top ten managed to match year-ago levels.Sony scored its fifth number one opener of the year with Lakeview Terrace which debuted with a solid $15.6M, according to estimates. The PG-13 film about a veteran cop that terrorizes an interracial couple that moves in next door to him played in 2,464 theaters and averaged an impressive $6,331 per site. Produced for about $20M, Terrace connected with adult audiences despite stiff competition in the marketplace for mature moviegoers. According to studio research, 69% of the crowd was over 25 while 56% was female. For Jackson, it was a chance to flex some solo muscle at the box office as the film had no other stars in it. An effective marketing campaign by the studio’s Screen Gems unit also helped to deliver results. Reviews were not too positive, but ticket buyers instead responded to starpower and a good promotional push.Last weekend’s number one film Burn After Reading held up well in its second frame. The caper comedy from the Coen brothers grossed an estimated $11.3M falling a reasonable 41% and lifted its ten-day cume to a solid $36.4M. The George Clooney-Brad Pitt pic enjoyed a smaller decline than those seen by other wide releases from the Oscar-winning filmmakers. 2003’s Intolerable Cruelty, which also starred the former Batman, dropped 48% in its second weekend while 2004’s Tom Hanks starrer The Ladykillers fell by 44%. Focus looks to ride Burn to the vicinity of $65M.Dane Cook’s newest comedy failed to live up to the numbers posted by his previous efforts. The romantic comedy My Best Friend’s Girl, which also stars Kate Hudson and Jason Biggs, bowed to an estimated $8.3M from 2,604 theaters for a weak $3,187 average. That was a hefty 39% below the $13.7M of Cook’s Good Luck Chuck from this same weekend last year, and 27% behind the $11.4M debut of Employee of the Month from October 2006. All three were released by Lionsgate in roughly 2,600 locations. Girl carried an R rating and earned the same negative reviews the comedian routinely sees from critics.Debuting to respectable results in fourth place was the new animated comedy Igor with an estimated $8M from 2,339 playdates. The PG-rated film averaged $3,425 and faced no competition in its quest for family audiences. Pre-release expectations were low since it is not based on any popular brand name property. The MGM release has no other kidpics to face next weekend so it may avoid the large drops seen by most other films.Three sophomore titles followed. The Robert De Niro-Al Pacino cop flick Righteous Kill tumbled 53% in its second weekend to an estimated $7.7M ranking fifth. With $28.8M taken in across ten days, the Overture Films release should eventually reach $40-45M. Kill has already become the top-grossing film for the new distribution company which made a name for itself this summer with the indie smash The Visitor.Tyler Perry’s latest hit The Family That Preys took a tumble in its second weekend falling 57% to an estimated $7.5M. The drop was nearly identical to the sophomore slides of 58% and 57% for past films Madea’s Family Reunion and Daddy’s Little Girls, respectively. Lionsgate has banked $28.4M in ten days with Family and should find its way to around $40M by the end of the run. Picturehouse witnessed a sharp decline for its chick flick The Women which fell 48% in its second outing to an estimated $5.3M. With $19.2M collected in ten days, the ensemble film could reach the neighborhood of $30M.Good reviews meant nothing to the new Ricky Gervais comedy Ghost Town which opened poorly in eighth place with an estimated $5.2M. Averaging a mild $3,436 from a subdued wide release in 1,505 locations, the PG-13 film about a dentist that can see and speak to spirits also stars Greg Kinnear and Tea Leoni. The target audience of mature adults had many other options to choose from so competition was tough, plus Gervais has yet to prove himself as a box office draw who can sell tickets. The DreamWorks production was released by Paramount.Warner Bros. spent its tenth weekend in the top ten with The Dark Knight which grossed an estimated $3M, off just 29%, for a towering $521.9M domestic total. Overseas, the gargantuan smash raised its cume to $455.7M giving the superhero blockbuster a stunning $977.6M worldwide. That puts Knight at number four on the all-time global blockbusters list after Titanic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest which all topped the $1 billion mark. Bruce Wayne should become a box office billionaire in early October. Sony’s leggy hit The House Bunny rounded out the top ten dipping 33% to an estimated $2.8M pushing the cume to $45.7M.September is when top distributors start rolling out their awards contenders and this weekend saw two of them generate sensational launches. Paramount Vantage unveiled the Keira Knightley costume drama The Duchess in seven theaters in New York and Los Angeles and grossed an estimated $203,000 for a sizzling $28,932 average. Attracting mostly good reviews, the PG-13 film will expand into the Top 20 markets this Friday. Warner Bros. rode into twice as many theaters with its Ed Harris-directed Western Appaloosa which collected an estimated $258,000. Averaging a sturdy $18,429 from 14 sites, the R-rated pic stars Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger, and Jeremy Irons and will expand nationally on October 3.The top ten films grossed an estimated $74.6M which was off only 1% from last year when Resident Evil: Extinction opened in the top spot with $23.7M; and down 3% from 2006 when Jackass: Number Two debuted at number one with $29M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Annual, Disney, Music","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Jackson-Debuts-Ahead-of-the-Race"},{"id":"47509144342499","title":"Box Office Wrapup: The Dogs Rule Once Again","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: The Dogs Rule Once AgainQuarantine pulls surprise victory over Body of Lies.by Sujit Chawla | October 12, 2008 |  CommentsIn one of the bigger upsets in recent box office history, the canineadventure Beverly Hills Chihuahuaremained at number one with the highly touted and highly pedigreed Body of Lieslanding with a thud in third.The rich dogs of Beverly Hills took pole position at the box office once againthis weekend as Beverly Hills Chihuahualapped up another $17.5M, according to estimates, a fall of 40% from lastweekend’s debut. The total for the PG-rated family adventure stands at $52.5Mwith the $100M brass ring now within site.Second place was a surprise with the Sony horror flick Quarantinescaring up an estimated $14.2M for a per screen average of a strong $5,770, topsin the top 10. Wit Halloween just around the corner, moviegoers were looking fora couple of good scares and the well-marketed Quarantine was just the ticket.Landing in third place with a very loud thud was the (former) Academy Awardhopeful Body of Lies.With past Academy winners and nominees taking part in all aspects of the filmincluding writing (William Monahan), directing (Ridley Scott)and acting (Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crow), Lies was expected to easily debut at number one but insteadthe war-on-terror story set in the Middle East did not resonate with audiences.Lies grossed $13.1M this weekend, according to estimates, for a per screenaverage of $4,841 while playing on 250 more screens than Quarantine.&nbsp;The highest grossing film of the season, Eagle Eye,fell to fourth place this weekend with an estimated $11M, a drop of 38% fromlast weekend, bringing it’s cume to $70.5M. Fifth place belonged to anotherholdover, the teen dramedy Nick &amp; Norah’s Infinite Playlistwhich took in $6.5M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its total to$20.8M. Look for a final gross in the $40M range.Debuting quietly in sixth place was the Universal football drama The Expresswith an estimated $4.7M. The story of Heisman-winning running back Ernie Davisfailed to connect with moviegoers but should see better results on DVD.&nbsp;Rob Brown as Ernie Davis in The ExpressSeventh place belonged to lovers as Nights in Rodanthefell 37% to $4.6M, according to estimates, bringing it’s total to $32.3M.The battle for eighth and ninth was a close one as the reported differencebetween the two films was only $18,000. Currently in eighth is the WarnerBrothers western Appaloosawhich roped in an estimated $3.34M this weekend, bringing its total to $10.8M.Rising into the top 10 at number nine was the period drama The Duchess with anestimated $3.32M bringing its cume to $5.6M for Paramount Vantage.Crash landing at number 10 was the debuting fantasy film City of Emberfrom Fox. The story of an underground city on the verge of collapse was yetanother film that failed to connect with paying audiences, grossing an estimated$3.2M for a poor per screen average of $1,583, the lowest in the top 10.&nbsp;The top ten films grossed $81.5M which was up 1.5% from last year when WhyDid I Get Married? opened in the top spot with $21.4M; and down 15.5% from2006 when The Grudge 2 debuted at number one with $20.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"boxing, Television","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-The-Dogs-Rule-Once-Again"},{"id":"47509144354794","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tropic Thunder Holds Strong","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tropic Thunder Holds StrongWhile the Bunny hops close on its heelsby Gitesh Pandya | August 24, 2008 |  CommentsThe final days of summer took their toll on the North American box office as moviegoing slowed down dramatically allowing Tropic Thunder to remain in first place for a second straight weekend. Among the frame’s four new releases, young females showed the most muscle powering the sorority comedy The House Bunny into second place while adult men pushed Jason Statham’s latest action pic Death Race into third. Ice Cube’s football drama The Longshots barely made the top ten while the Rainn Wilson comedy The Rocker was dead on arrival bowing at number twelve.Ben Stiller and his platoon of actors stayed in control of the box office with a healthy second weekend for Tropic Thunder which grossed an estimated $16.1M. Dropping only 38%, the R-rated action-comedy displayed a good hold and bumped its 12-day total to a solid $65.7M. The $90M Paramount release looks set to find its way to $105-115M.Anna Faris attracted a solid opening to her new comedy The House Bunny which performed above expectations with an estimated $15.1M. The PG-13 movie finds the star of the Scary Movie franchise playing an ex-Playboy bunny who becomes a house mother to a sorority of misfits. Sony released the film in 2,714 sites and averaged an encouraging $5,564. With so many action films and R-rated comedies aimed at guys over the past month, Bunny served as effective counter-programming for young women who showed up in impressive numbers. According to studio research, an incredibly high 68% of the audience was female while 54% was under 21. The production budget was $25M.Finishing in third place for the weekend was Universal’s new Jason Statham actioner Death Race with an estimated $12.3M from 2,532 locations. Averaging a respectable $4,855 per theater, the R-rated pic performed in line with the actor’s other offerings debuting higher than 2006’s Crank ($10.5M) but lower than 2005’s Transporter 2 ($16.5M). Both of those opened over Labor Day weekend. As expected, adult men made up the bulk of the audience with studio research showing that 63% of the crowd was male while 52% was 25 and older. Death Race carried a $45M pricetag making it more expensive than most of the action hero’s previous starring vehicles.Hollywood’s biggest superhero ever followed in fourth as The Dark Knight pulled in an estimated $10.3M in its sixth weekend. Sliding only 37%, the Warner Bros. megasmash pushed its record cume up to $489.2M and should surpass the $500M mark next weekend. The magic continued overseas with an estimated $34M from 62 markets this weekend sending the international total soaring to $381.2M. With the global tally now standing at a towering $870M, The Dark Knight should easily become only the fourth movie in history to top $1 billion at the worldwide box office following Titanic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest.Suffering the worst decline in the top ten was Star Wars: The Clone Wars which tumbled 61% to an estimated $5.7M pushing the ten-day tally to $25M. The Warner Bros. animated entry should finish up with $36-38M. Sony’s Pineapple Express followed closely with an estimated $5.6M, down 43%, putting the stoner comedy’s cume at $73.9M. The horror flick Mirrors dropped 56% to an estimated $4.9M in its second weekend and has scared up $20.1M after ten days. A $30M tally is likely by the end of the run.Two films tied for eighth place with an estimated $4.3M in ticket sales each. Universal’s musical smash Mamma Mia! dipped just 29% and raised its domestic haul to $124.5M. This Friday the studio will release in selected theaters a new sing-along version of the hit film for Labor Day weekend which includes on-screen lyrics to all the songs to encourage audience participation, and prolong the box office run. Mamma’s overseas sum zoomed to $232.5M pushing the global gross to a stellar $357M.The other film in the number eight spot was the new Ice Cube football pic The Longshots which averaged only $2,058 from 2,089 locations. The PG-rated film was released by MGM and earned lukewarm reviews. Universal rounded out the top ten with The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor which grossed an estimated $4.1M, down 50%, for a $93.8M total. The overseas tally climbed to $222.4M giving the China-set adventure sequel a muscular $316M worldwide with 70% coming from outside of North America.Fox’s new Rainn Wilson comedy The Rocker debuted to pathetic results and failed to make the top ten. The PG-13 pic headlined by the co-star of The Office bowed to an estimated $2.75M from 2,784 theaters (the most for any new film this weekend) and averaged a pitiful $988 per site. It was the worst opening in box office history for a film bowing in 2,600+ theaters. Audiences ignored the pic sending a message to Hollywood that Wilson is not yet ready to graduate from second banana in the sitcom world to leading man of a theatrical release. Since its Wednesday launch, The Rocker has collected just $3.8M in five days.Making a moderate splash in limited release was the quirky indie comedy Hamlet 2 which debuted with an estimated $435,000 from 103 theaters for a mediocre $4,226 average. A smash at this year’s Sundance film festival where it was bought by Focus for a hefty $10M, the R-rated tale tells of a high school drama teacher and his students who put on a controversial musical in order to save their arts program. The distributor is hoping that this weekend’s limited debut will spark word-of-mouth that will fuel next weekend’s national expansion into 1,500 theaters over the long holiday session. But given this start, the road ahead will not be a smooth one. In 1999, Rushmore debuted in the same number of theaters but grossed $1.8M on opening weekend with a $17,881 average on its way to $17.1M overall. Almost Famous launched in 131 sites with $2.3M and a $17,669 average on its way to $32.5M. Hamlet 2 will need plenty of fan support if it wants to stay on screens into the fall season.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82.6M which was off 2% from last year when Superbad stayed in the top spot with $18M in its sophomore frame; but up 9% from 2006 when Invincible debuted at number one with $17M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Country, video, werewolf","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Tropic-Thunder-Holds-Strong"},{"id":"47509147413499","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Chan and Li Rule Box Office Kingdom","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Chan and Li Rule Box Office KingdomBut audiences didn't forget about Sarah Marshall.by Gitesh Pandya | April 20, 2008 |  CommentsAudiences were fired up for the first-ever showdown between martial artslegends Jackie Chan andJet Li as theirnew fantasy actioner TheForbidden Kingdom opened at number one at theaters across North America.Those in search of laughs powered the starless breakup comedy ForgettingSarah Marshall into second place with a strong debut of its own.Targeting different audiences, the one-two punch was enough to propel theoverall box office ahead of last year’s levels by a respectable margin.Lionsgate scored its first top spot debut of the year with TheForbidden Kingdom which grossed an estimated $20.9M from 3,151theaters over the weekend. The PG-13 adventure film averaged a solid $6,623 perlocation and saw much of its support from young male audiences and fans ofmartial arts movies. In the film, an American teen mysteriously travels back toancient China and embarks on a quest to free the famed Monkey King.Chan andLi, who each gotto play a double role, provided the starpower to pull in paying audiences.Reviews were mixed.Opening in second place with a solid debut of its own was the raunchyrelationship comedy ForgettingSarah MarshallForgetting Sarah Marshall which grossed an estimated$17.4M from 2,798 theaters. The R-rated pic about a man coping with being dumpedby his celebrity girlfriend averaged a commendable $6,201 and played best toadult women. The Sarah bow was below what producerJudd Apatowhas seen in the past with his R-rated summer comedies The40-Year-Old Virgin ($21.4M), Knocked Up($30.7M), and Superbad ($33.1M). However, it was stronger than the debutsof his latest offerings Walk Hard ($4.2M) and Drillbit Taylor($10.3M). Since the surprise success of Virgin in 2005, studios have usedApatow’s name and resume to market anything he remotely has been involved in.Sony claimed three of the next four slots.

The race for second place was extremely close as the Warner Bros. family picture Speed Racer and Fox’s comedy What Happens in Vegas delivered nearly identical numbers over the weekend. Regardless, the new product and the strong hold from the super hero giant helped the overall marketplace surge well ahead of year-ago levels.Paramount ruled the box office again with the first installment of its new super hero franchise Iron Man which grossed an estimated $50.5M dropping 49% from last week. Compared to the studio’s $102.1M bow which included Thursday night showtimes the second weekend decline was still just 51% which amounted to a strong hold given the enormous amount of business that was generated in the first weekend. The cume has soared to $177.1M already making it the top-grossing film of 2008 by surpassing the $150.7M that Horton Hears A Who has collected over the last two months.Iron Man is off to the best start ever for a non-webslinger comic book movie. The total beat out ten-day starts for 2003’s X2: X-Men United ($147.7M) and 2006’s X-Men: The Last Stand ($175.3M). The third mutant adventure even launched over the lucrative Memorial Day holiday weekend. X2 dropped by a similar 53% in its second session and its ten-day cume would amount to roughly $174M at today’s ticket prices so Iron Man is closely following that Marvel film’s admissions trajectory. The second X-Men flick, which had the same May 2 opening date five years ago, went on to gross $214.9M domestically, or around $250M at 2008 prices.The Robert Downey Jr. pic scored the largest sophomore weekend haul of any film since last May’s Shrek the Third which banked $53M on its second frame. Positive word-of-mouth helped as fans are recommending the super hero film to others and helping to drive sales. Plus the two new releases ended up not providing too much competition. This Friday’s release of The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and the following week’s debut of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will provide some formidable distractions very soon. But at its current pace, Iron Man should soar to $260-280M from North America alone and could break the $500M mark worldwide.Warner Bros. and Fox both fought over the number two spot with their new releases. According to estimates released on Sunday, Warners won by a slim $200,000 margin however the rankings could get switched on Monday when final grosses are tabulated. But based on Friday and Saturday grosses, neither studio could claim a true victory as the race was too close to call.The big-budget family film Speed Racer struggled in its opening weekend bowing to an estimated $20.2M from 3,606 locations. Averaging a decent $5,605 per theater, the PG-rated film from the Wachowski Brothers fell short of all industry expectations. Even the least bullish projections forecast a debut in the high $20M range. Panned by most critics, the colorful and stylized racing flick tried to target kids and parents but failed to truly connect with audiences. Other high profile live-action summer films based on cartoon shows of the past fared better like Scooby Doo which bowed to $54.2M in 2002 and The Flintstones which debuted to $37.2M over four days back in 1994. Speed Racer at least didn’t crash and burn like The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle which opened to a miserable $6.8M in 2000.Warner Bros. calculated a slim 11% Sunday decline into its weekend estimate which may end coming down on Monday when final numbers are added up. Fox estimated a 29% Sunday drop for What Happens in Vegas and most major wide releases experienced 30-40% declines on Sunday. Speed Racer suffered from bad buzz and intense competition from Iron Man which appealed to many of the same people. Plus the racing pic is based on a property that lacks the broad mainstream appeal that other major summer films benefit from. With a reported production cost of well over $100M, Speed Racer also got off to a slow start overseas grossing just $12.8M from 30 markets. South Korea saw the largest international opening with $2.4M helped undoubtedly by the film’s casting of Korean pop star Rain, however most countries saw debut weekends of under $1M.Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher made their own bid for the runnerup spot with the new anti-romantic comedy What Happens in Vegas which took in an estimated $20M this weekend. Playing in 3,215 playdates, the PG-13 film averaged a solid $6,221 per venue. Vegas performed better than all the other recent comedies to hit the marketplace over the last month scoring higher than the openings for Forgetting Sarah Marshall ($17.7M), Baby Mama ($17.4M), and Made of Honor ($14.8M). In fact if the estimate holds, Vegas will enjoy the third best comedy opening of the year after 27 Dresses ($23M) and Meet the Browns ($20.1M).Four recent comedies with a combined cume of $148M followed with each dropping by less than 50%. In its second weekend, Sony’s Made of Honor fell by 49% to an estimated $7.6M pushing the ten-day tally to respectable $26.3M. Budgeted at $40M (a tad high for a laugher), the Patrick Dempsey vehicle should find its way to a mediocre $40-45M domestically.Universal’s pair of comedies Baby Mama and Forgetting Sarah Marshall followed with estimates of $5.8M and $3.8M, respectively. The Tina Fey–Amy Poehler pic dropped 43% and lifted its sum to $40.4M. Judd Apatow‘s latest R-rated concoction dipped by only 38% and has laughed up $50.7M to date.Falling 49% was the stoner sequel Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay with an estimated $3.2M giving New Line and parent Warner Bros. $30.7M to date.Jackie Chan and Jet Li claimed the number eight spot with The Forbidden Kingdom which took in an estimated $1.9M, off 55%, for a $48.3M total for Lionsgate. Fox’s kidpic Nim’s Island fell 51% to an estimated $1.3M giving the adventure film $44.3M in its sixth week of play.Sony Classics expanded its martial arts drama Redbelt after a week in limited release and landed in the top ten with an estimated $1.1M. Averaging a weak $827 from 1,379 locations, the R-rated action film upped its total to $1.2M and should conclude its run with less than $4M.Sony saw two hits and a flop fall out of the top ten this weekend. The teen thriller Prom Night tumbled 56% to an estimated $1.1M boosting the cume to $42.8M. Produced for only $20M, the PG-13 fright flick should end up with a solid $45M. The card-counting drama 21 enjoyed a six-week streak in the top ten but dropped 58% this weekend to an estimated $835,000. With a robust $80.4M in winnings earned to date, the Kevin Spacey flick looks to cash out with around $82M which was much better than anyone had expected.Al Pacino did not have much luck with audiences as they ignored his latest crime thriller 88 Minutes. The dismal entry collapsed by 69% this weekend taking in just $485,000, according to estimates, to push its embarrassing sum to only $16.4M. Not much more will be added.The top ten films grossed an estimated $115.4M which was up a healthy 24% from last year when Spider-Man 3 remained on top with $58.2M; and up a sturdy 43% from 2006 when Mission: Impossible III stayed at number one with $25M. Both of those action sequels were in their second weekends.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"comedy, One, Trophy, transformers, football, Comic-Con, comic, SXSW, marvel, jurassic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Iron-Man-Rocks-Speed-Racer-Stalls"},{"id":"47509206322717","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Mrs. Doubtfire Sequel in the Works","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Mrs. Doubtfire Sequel in the Works\n                        Plus, new roles for Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will Ferrell.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 18, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis Week’s Ketchup includes movie development news stories including a Mrs. Doubtfire sequel, and new roles for Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Ferrell, and Brad Pitt.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nROBIN WILLIAMS TO STAR IN MRS. DOUBTFIRE SEQUEL\n\nThis was a slow movie development news week.  How do we know that? The only story that received much traction on social media (besides old stories that aren’t really news) was this one. Twenty one years after Mrs. Doubtfire was one of the hit comedy movies of 1993 (it really was!), Fox 2000 has revived plans for the long-in-development sequel to the film. A lot has changed in those 21 years since Mrs. Doubtfire (and since 1996 when Robin Williams also starred in The Birdcage, another movie featuring cross dressing). Of course, a lot has also not changed, including at the movies, where Tyler Perry’s Madea movies have been consistent hits.  Another sign that things have not changed as much as we would like is that there was a controversy last year over how images from Mrs. Doubtfire were used in online coverage of transgender issues. Williams and director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone) are both expected to return for the sequel, which is being written by David Berenbaum (Elf, The Haunted Mansion).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 STEVEN SPIELBERG PRODUCING AND MAY DIRECT THE KIDNAPPING OF EDGARDO MORTARA\n\nNearly a year and a half after the release of Lincoln, we still don’t know yet what Steven Spielberg’s next directing project will be, although a few different possibilities have occasionally made the news since 2012. Those projects have included the sci-fi movie Robopocalypse, the Moses epic Gods and Kings, the Bradley Cooper movie American Sniper, and a Cortes/Moctezuma movie written 50 years ago by the very late Dalton Trumbo. The latest project that might join that list is an adaptation of the non-fiction book The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara by David Kertzer, which Spielberg is now producing (and might direct).  The book tells the true story of a religious controversy in 1858 during which an Italian Jewish child was taken from his parents and raised as a Catholic (eventually becoming a priest, even). The script is being adapted by Tony Kushner, who previously worked with Steven Spielberg on two other historical true stories (Munich and Lincoln). As for Dalton Trumbo, who died in 1976, his life will soon become a movie of its own, with Bryan Cranston playing Trumbo, and Helen Mirren now in talks to play his wife.\n\n\n\t\n#2 BRAD PITT TO PLAY GENERAL MCCHRYSTAL IN THE OPERATORS\n\nThe legacy of the military career of General Stanley McChrystal might have gone a different way without the publication four years ago of a Rolling Stone profile that quickly became quite controversial. Hollywood history is littered with biographical movies about powerful figures brought down by their own ambitions or egos, and if that’s the way the movie is interpreted, it may happen again for Stanley McChrystal. Brad Pitt is now producing and is attached to star in an adaptation of the book The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America’s War in Afghanistan by Michael Hastings. The movie will be directed by Australian director David Michôd (Animal Kingdom), who is also adapting the screenplay. The Hollywood Reporter describes the book as depicting, “the rise and fall of General Stanley McChrystal, the commanding general of international and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and offers a behind-the-scenes portrait of our military commanders, their high-stakes maneuvers and the political firestorm that shook the United States.”\n\n\n\t\n#3 LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO GET MAULED BY A BEAR IN THE REVENANT\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Babel, Amores Perros) will work together for the first time on an adaptation of the Michael Punke novel, The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge. Leonardo DiCaprio will play “a 19th century fur trapper who is mauled by a grizzly bear, left for dead and then robbed. When he survives against all odds, he sets out on a treacherous journey to exact revenge on his betrayers.” Filming is expected to start this September, and The Revenant is expected to be released in the awards season of late 2015. Inarritu’s next released film before The Revenant will be Birdman, featuring Michael Keaton as an aging actor living in the twilight years following playing a very famous superhero.\n\n\n\t\n#4 HOT STUFF THE LITTLE DEVIL TO RAISE HELL FOR DREAMWORKS ANIMATION\n\nThis probably dates this particular writer quite a bit, but one of my favorite “kids comic books” back in the day was Hot Stuff the Little Devil, published by Harvey Comics. He was a character that Hellboy creator Mike Mignola was clearly inspired by (Mignola has also spoofed Hot Stuff with shorts called Hellboy Junior). Basically, Hot Stuff the Little Devil is literally a little devil baby, complete with diapers and an adorable little pitchfork. And Hot Stuff is now in development as yet another character that today’s kids have never heard of, but will get a DreamWorks Animation movie about him anyway. The movie is being adapted by siblings Wendy and Lizzie Molyneux, who have previously worked on the TV series Bob’s Burgers.\n\n\n\t\n#5 WILL FERRELL AND JOHN C. REILLY TO REUNITE AS BORDER GUARDS\n\nWill Ferrell has starred as an TV anchorman just this side of the Mexican border, and in the telenovella spoof Casa de mi Padre. He’s also worked twice before with John C. Reilly (Talladega Nights and Step Brothers). This week’s new project completes both trifectas, as Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are attached to star in the comedy Border Guards. Frequent Ferrell collaborator Adam McKay will be directing from a script by Jesse Armstrong (In the Loop). Ferrell and Reilly will play “two hapless but earnest friends who decide to give purpose to their lives by protecting America’s borders from illegal immigrants. In the process they find themselves accidentally stranded in Mexico without identification and must sneak back into the U.S.”\n\n\n\t\n#6 JADEN SMITH AND LIEV SCHREIBER TO STAR IN THE SLAVERY DRAMA THE GOOD LORD BIRD\n\nWhen one movie finds success, that often leads to other movies with similar subjects finally getting their own chance at a greenlight, and usually, that would lead to a cynical response. However, when the subject matter is something like slavery, and the successful film in question was 12 Years a Slave, it might arguably be an example of Hollywood’s greenlighting cliches actually serving an admirable cause. Liev Schreiber and Jaden Smith (After Earth, The Karate Kid) are now attached to star in The Good Lord Bird, an adaptation of the 2013 National Book Award winner by author James McBride. Jaden Smith will play a young slave in Kansas in 1856 who meets the radical abolitionist John Brown (Schreiber). The book was satirical, and features Jaden Smith’s character wearing a dress, and encounters with other historical figures like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman. There’s no director announced yet.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 DAVID FINCHER HAS DROPPED OUT OF THE “OTHER” STEVE JOBS BIOPIC\n\nFans of director David Fincher who were excited about him reuniting with writer Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network) for the second movie about Apple cofounder Steve Jobs got some bad news this week.  David Fincher has dropped out of the project reportedly over financial bargaining (namely $10 million up front, and control of the film’s marketing). There had also been earlier stories that Fincher’s request for Christian Bale to play Steve Jobs would have also led to a deal breaker, but Bale’s involvement (or lack thereof) wasn’t specifically mentioned as being a cause for Fincher’s departure. David Fincher’s next film in theaters will be Gone Girl, starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, on October 3, 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#2 JOHNNY DEPP HAS REPORTEDLY JOINED THE KEVIN SMITH HORROR FILM TUSK\n\nKevin Smith has obviously worked with some big Hollywood stars in the past (like say, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, obviously), but this week’s announcement is sort of on a whole other level. According to actor Justin Long, who has also been cast in Kevin Smith’s walrus-themed horror film Tusk, Johnny Depp will also have a role. Although the story hasn’t been officially confirmed, Kevin Smith had previously hinted that he had landed a major movie star for a supporting role that will only require two days of filming. Michael Parks, Haley Joel Osment, and Genesis Rodriguez will also be in Tusk. Here’s a link to Kevin Smith’s RT Tomatometer page.\n\n\n\t\n#1 JOHN LEGEND ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR A FOUND FOOTAGE DANCE MOVIE\n\nWhen people look back at the sort of annoying movie trends of the years before and after 2010, “found footage” will almost certainly not be remembered 100% fondly. It is certainly true that audiences turn up for (some of) these movies, but the whole “shaky cam” thing is definitely an acquired taste (that doesn’t work with all types of stories, either). Will audiences tolerate the format for a dance movie, for example? R&amp;B singing star John Legend is testing the waters with Breaking Through, a collaboration with Step Up: All In screenwriter John Swetnam. Put another way, the production is describing Breaking Through as a “documentary-style dance drama for the YouTube generation.” It’s (not really) a convincing argument. Why stay at home watching people dance in videos on your tablet when you can go to a movie theater and pay $10-$15 a ticket to see… basically the same thing?\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"99%, Signature, Christmas, Rey, The, series, reboot, Trek, dceu, italian","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Mrs-Doubtfire-Sequel-in-the-Works"},{"id":"47509147415548","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Prom Night Crowned Multiplex Queen","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Prom Night Crowned Multiplex Queenby Gitesh Pandya | April 13, 2008 |  CommentsTeen girls seized control of the North American box office powering thehorror remake Prom Nightto number one. Adult men settled for the runnerup spot with the Keanu Reevescop thriller Street Kingsas the overall box office failed to generate any kind of notable heat. Themarketplace has now trailed last year’s grosses during eight of the last nineweekends.The frame’s one major bright spot came in the form of Prom Night,a reboot of the 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis chiller, which captured the crown with anestimated $22.7M in its first weekend in theaters. Attacking 2,700 locations,the PG-13 suspense pic averaged a spectacular $8,407 per venue. Horror filmsrarely surpass the $8,000 per-theater average mark unless the word Saw is in the title. Witha strong marketing campaign from Sony’s Screen Gems unit, a recognizable face in Brittany Snow,a commercially friendly rating, and a release date right before prom seasonmaking the subject matter very topical, the slasher hit connected with teens andyoung adults looking for a scare.Prom was just the latest success story from Hollywood’s continuousmission to recycle old horror hits. Audiences came out in huge numbers for otherremakes in recent years like 2003’s The TexasChainsaw Massacre ($28.1M debut), 2004’s Dawn of the Dead($26.7M), 2005’s The AmityvilleHorror ($23.5M), and last year’sHalloween($26.4M). With Prom Night, Sony also tied Fox for the industry lead ofthree $20M+ openers this year. With a production cost of nearly $20M, Prom Nightshould become the latest profitable fright flick for the studio.Collecting about half as much business in its opening weekend was the Keanu Reevescop thriller Street Kingswhich debuted to an estimated $12M. The R-rated actioner averaged a commendable$4,864 from 2,467 sites. Forest Whitaker, Hugh Laurie, Jay Mohr, and Cedric the Entertainerco-star in the tale of dirty L.A. cops. The Fox Searchlight film played to theopposite audience that rallied behind Prom Night pulling in adults with amale skew. Reviews were not kind. The debut was almost identical to the $11.9Mlaunch of the Bruce Willis film 16 Blocks.Both were star-driven police thrillers released in the spring. Blocks eventuallyreached $36.9M.After two weeks as the top card sharks, Kevin Spacey and pals saw theirblackjack pic 21fall to third place with an estimated $11M. Slipping only 28%, the Sony releasewas still a formidable player with an impressive third-frame gross and $4,020average. With a solid $62.3M won in 17 days, the card-counting hit should finishup with a terrific $90M.After a fierce battle over second place last weekend, Fox’s Nim’s Islandand Universal’s Leatherheadswitnessed vastly different sophomore drops that gave the Abigail Breslinadventure a clear edge this time around. The family film dipped only 32% to anestimated $9M while theGeorge Clooneycomedy fumbled by 51% to an estimated $6.2M. Ten-day totals reached $25.3M and$21.9M, respectively. Nim’s, which was produced for $37M, is not facingmuch competition for its core audience so a lengthier run leading to $45-50Mseems likely. The $58M-budgeted Leatherheads is suffering from bad buzzand should end its season with a disappointing $35M. But Universal has two morepromising players hitting the field this month – the comedies ForgettingSarah Marshall and Baby Mama – whichshould allow the studio to recover.The year’s highest grossing film in the domestic market Horton Hears a Whofollowed in sixth with an estimated $6M in its fifth session. Off only 34%, theFox blockbuster has banked $139.6M to date.Miramax posted a modest opening for its Dennis Quaid–Sarah Jessica Parkerdramedy Smart Peoplewhich took in an estimated $4.2M in its first weekend in theaters. Playing inonly 1,106 sites, the R-rated film averaged a lukewarm $3,797 per theater. Olderadults were the target audience with women outnumbering men. Reviews were notvery strong.The Ruins crumbled 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $3.3M thanksto intense competition for the horror crowd from Prom Night. With only$13.4M scared up in ten days, the DreamWorks/Paramount pic should quickly endits run with under $20M.The spoof comedy Superhero Movie grossed an estimated $3.1M, off 43%,and boosted its total to $21.2M for MGM and The Weinstein Co. Paramount’s Drillbit Taylorrounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.1M, down 39%, for a cume to date of$28.5M.A pair of independent films debuted to healthy numbers in limited release thisweekend. Overture generated muscular figures for its illegal alien drama The Visitorwhich grossed an estimated $88,000 from only four houses for a potent $22,000average. The PG-13 film expands wider on Friday.Fox Searchlight saw its musical documentary Young@Hearttake in an estimated $52,312 from four locations as well and averaged a solid$13,078. The senior citizen flick expands to 15 new markets on Friday and willslowly roll out to roughly 260 theaters over the next month.Three radically different films were tossed out of the top ten this weekend.Lionsgate collected an estimated $1.6M for the Tyler Perrycomedy Meet the Browns.Down 54%, the Angela Bassettfilm has taken in $40.1M to date and should reach about $43M overall. Fox’shorror remake Shuttertumbled 63% to an estimated $1.1M for a $24.8M cume. A respectable $26M finalshould result.The prehistoric adventure10,000 BCgrossed an estimated $1.5M, down 46%, and lifted its total to $91.8M. The WarnerBros. actioner will soon surpass studio stablemate The Bucket List tobecome the second highest grossing film of the year so far. A $95M final seemslikely. Overseas, the caveman flick has taken in a robust $158.7M allowing theglobal tally to break the $250M mark this weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $79.5M which was down 13% from last yearwhen Disturbiaopened at number one with $22.2M; and down 26% from 2006 when Scary Movie 4debuted in the top spot over the Easter frame with $40.2M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"chucky, 72, Sundance, Amazon, trailers, FX, television, anthology, Spring, American, bond, The, travel","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Prom-Night-Crowned-Multiplex-Queen"},{"id":"47509147410426","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Baby Mama Delivers a #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Baby Mama Delivers a #1Meanwhile, Harold and Kumar inhale $15 million worth of tickets.by Sujit Chawla | April 27, 2008 |  CommentsThe females beat the males this week as Baby Mama outdueled Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay for the top spot at the box office in this, the final weekend before the summer movie season kicks off.Former SNL Weekend Update co-anchors, and current BFF’s, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler‘s Baby Mama found its way to top of the charts this weekend, taking in an estimated $18.2M. The female buddy comedy about Poehler becoming a surrogate mother for Fey, averaged a strong $7,184 per screen for Universal.Landing in second place was the male buddy comedy Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay, which smoked up an estimated $14.5M this weekend, in one of the last releases for New Line Cinema. In 2004, Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle opened with a disappointing $5.5M on its way to a $18.2M final gross. Its sequel, after 4 years of gaining a cult following, nearly hit that amount in its first weekend.Third and fourth places went to last weekend’s numbers one and two. In third was the battle of the martial arts experts, The Forbidden Kingdom. Falling 47.5% from last weekend, the Lionsgate film brought in $11.2M, according to estimates, bringing its total to $38.3. Look for a final gross in the $55M range. Fourth place went to another Universal comedy, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which slipped 38% to $11M, according to estimates, bringing its cume to $35.1M. Look for a final gross in the same $55M range.Fox and Sony controlled the rest of the top 10, with three titles each. In fifth place for a second consecutive weekend was the family adventure Nim’s Island, which had the best hold in the top 10, dipping only 20% for an estimated $4.5M this weekend. Its cume now stands at $39M after four weeks.Sony’s triumverate of films landed in the six to eight spots. Leading off was the PG-13 horror film Prom Night, which fell 49% from last weekend to an estimated $4.4M, bringing its cume to $38.1M. In seventh was the surprisingly strong 21 which fell only 27.5% this weekend, taking in an additional $4M in chips, according to estimates. Its total now stands at a very solid $75.8M. Crashing and burning into eighth was 88 Minutes . The Al Pacino-led thriller fell 48% from last weekend’s debut to an estimated $3.6M. Its total stands at $12.6M with not much more left in the bucket. Look for a final gross in the $15M range.Spending a seventh week in the top 10, and landing at number nine was the Fox animated hit Horton Hears a Who, which took in $2.4M according to estimates, falling 31% from last weekend. Its cume now stands at a towering $147.9M. However its reign as the top grossing film of 2008 will come to an end very shortly. And rounding out the top ten was Fox stablemate Deception which landed with a thud and earned an estimated $2.1M this weekend, for a per theater average of a dismal $1,114. Look for a quick trip to the DVD aisles for this one.The top ten films grossed $76.2M which was up 34% from last year when Disturbia took its third trip to number one with $9M; and down 11% from 2006 when RV debuted in the top spot with $16.4M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"independent, Funimation, Cartoon, globe, Interview, richard, french, leads","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Baby-Mama-Delivers-a-1"},{"id":"47509146304496","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moody Superheroes Rule the Box Office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moody Superheroes Rule the Box OfficeWhile the Human Spaceship Belly Flopsby Gitesh Pandya | July 13, 2008 |  CommentsA week before The Joker unleashes chaos, moviegoers passed the time by driving the comic book sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army to a number one debut while also showing up in solid numbers for the 3D adventure Journey to the Center of the Earth. On the other hand, Eddie Murphy‘s new comedy Meet Dave was totally ignored and suffered a dismal debut becoming the summer’s biggest flop. Holdover pictures in the top ten performed well with each dropping by less than 50%.One superhero with an attitude problem replaced another in the top spot as Universal’s actioner Hellboy II debuted ahead of the pack with an estimated $35.9M in its first weekend of release. Directed by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan’s Labyrinth), the PG-13 film opened 55% better than the $23.2M bow of its 2004 predecessor which Sony released. It went on to gross a mediocre $59M but grew its audience on DVD and cable. Golden Army averaged a sturdy $11,200 from 3,204 theaters. Budgeted at $85M, the new Hellboy took advantage of a built-in audience of fans and the starpower that its director has generated after winning three Oscars for Labyrinth. Reviews were very favorable and the studio is keeping the door open for a sequel, even though del Toro will spend the next three years in New Zealand making back-to-back Hobbit films.Close behind in second place was Will Smith‘s latest blockbuster Hancock which dropped 47% to an estimated $33M to boost its cume to a robust $165M after twelve and a half days. That’s an exact match to the total that 2005’s sci-fi action offering from Independence Day weekend War of the Worlds took in after its second session. The Steven Spielberg-Tom Cruise collaboration suffered a bigger drop of 53% and a smaller sophomore take of $30.5M, but did not have the extra revenue from night-before-opening previews like Hancock.It was a strong hold for Smith especially with the solid debuts of two new action films. Hancock also gave the superstar actor his fifth consecutive $150M+ blockbuster further cementing his status as the most bankable star in Hollywood. The road ahead could be a rough one though given Friday’s eagerly-awaited launch of the competing superhero juggernaut The Dark Knight, but a final domestic tally in the neighborhood of $250M could result. Overseas, the badass crimefighter soared to $180.2M in sales catapulting the worldwide cume to an eye-popping $345M in less than two weeks. The $150M production could fly to $500-600M globally.Opening well in third place was the 3D adventure tale Journey to the Center of the Earth starring Brendan Fraser with an estimated $20.6M. The New Line/Warner Bros. film launched in 2,811 theaters and averaged a solid $7,321 per site. However, the grosses from 3D and traditional 2D theaters were like night and day. A whopping 70% of the total venues did not have equipment to offer the film in 3D and those theaters averaged only about $2,000 each. But the 854 sites that did screen the PG-rated film in 3D averaged close to $20,000 per playdate and accounted for more than 80% of the weekend business. Most of those charged higher ticket prices too which helped to boost the grosses. Reviews were generally good for the $60M-budgeted project. Journey also had a limited international premiere grossing $4.2M from five markets led by $2.1M in the United Kingdom and $1.5M in Brazil.Disney and Pixar followed in fourth with WALL•E which grossed an estimated $18.5M in its third frame dropping 43%. The decline was bigger than Ratatouille‘s 38% dip during its third session a year ago this same weekend. The robot pic opened $16M better than the rodent comedy, but now their third weekend tallies are nearly identical as WALL•E‘s legs have not been as sturdy. Still, look for this latest animation gem to roll its way to roughly $220M domestically.Angelina Jolie had an eventful weekend welcoming in two new babies and also having twin films in the top ten. Her action thriller Wanted placed fifth with an estimated $11.6M, down 42%, boosting Universal’s cume to $112M. The actress also voiced Tigress in Kung Fu Panda further down on the chart. Jolie has now upped her counts for both children and $100M career blockbusters to six each.Get Smart came in sixth with an estimated $7.1M, down only 36%, and reached $111.5M after 24 days for Warner Bros.Stealing the ‘Flop of the Summer’ title from Speed Racer, Eddie Murphy stumbled into seventh place with a disastrous opening for his new comedy Meet Dave which grossed just $5.3M, according to estimates. The PG-rated film landed in 3,011 theaters and averaged a puny $1,760. It was the third worst opening in box office history for a film released in more than 3,000 theaters and certainly the poorest for a pricey star vehicle. The only films to open worse were last year’s The Seeker: The Dark is Rising ($3.7M from 3,141 sites) and 2006’s Hoot ($3.4M from 3,018 playdates).Carrying a budget of roughly $60M, buzz was always bad for Meet Dave and the concept of Murphy playing a human-looking spaceship operated by a mini crew inside of him, with a captain also played by the funnyman, did not fly with audiences. Competition also played a part as every film that ranked higher also offered action, comedy, or both. Dave‘s opening was a far cry from the solid $34.2M debut that Murphy’s comedy Norbit scored last year and joins the Oscar-nominated comedian’s hall of box office shame along with The Adventures of Pluto Nash, Holy Man, and Best Defense.Kung Fu Panda dropped 41% to eighth place with an estimated $4.3M sending the martial arts toon across the $200M mark with a total to date of $202M. The Paramount/DreamWorks pic is running 8% behind the pace of Disney/Pixar’s Cars from 2006 and will probably finish with roughly $215M. The Abigail Breslin pic Kit Kittredge: An American Girl held up well in its second weekend of wide release slipping just 29% to an estimated $2.4M. Though it enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten, it still has only collected $11M to date and seems headed for a $18-20M finish.Rounding out the top ten was Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with an estimated $2.3M in its eighth weekend, down 40%, raising the overall tally to $310.5M. The Harrison Ford adventure sequel is now within striking distance of fellow Paramount release Iron Man‘s $313.4M and could become the new top grosser of 2008. Warner Bros. fully intends to make it a three-picture race with The Dark Knight which could very well reach the same stratosphere by month’s end.Three films fell from the top ten this weekend. Universal’s The Incredible Hulk took in an estimated $2.2M, off 55%, for a $129.8M sum. That puts the new green guy a scant 1% ahead of Ang Lee’s Hulk at the same point in its 2003 run. Factor in higher ticket prices and the new Hulk has actually attracted fewer fans than the old one did, and cost a bit more. Budgeted at $150M, The Incredible Hulk should end up with about $135M edging out the $132.2M gross of Hulk, but will sell 13% fewer tickets. Overseas, the Edward Norton pic smashed the $100M mark boosting the international cume to $101.3M and the global tally to $231M.The much more profitable Sex and the City banked an estimated $1.7M, down only 28%, and raised its total to a stellar $148.2M. A final domestic haul of $155M seems likely for the New Line film distributed by Warner Bros. The overseas performance for the $60M production has been sensational with $220.5M taken in to date accounting for 60% of the global haul of $369M. Astounding industry observers, Sex has become the fourth biggest global blockbuster of 2008 after the Paramount triumvirate of Indiana Jones, Iron Man, and Kung Fu Panda.The summer’s other fashion-related comedy You Don’t Mess With the Zohan fell 46% to an estimated $1.1M giving the Adam Sandler vehicle $96.9M so far. The Sony release should inch its way to the $100M mark making it the comedian’s lowest gross for a broad comedy since 2000’s Little Nicky.The top ten films grossed an estimated $140.9M which was down 17% from last year when Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix opened in the top spot with $77.1M; and off 5% from 2006 when Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest spent a second weekend at number one with $62.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"award, crime, tv, Amazon, Tarantino, thriller, cancelled, LGBT, TV, movies, Calendar, Mary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Moody-Superheroes-Rule-the-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509146315765","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Indiana Jones Rules Over Slow Holiday Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Indiana Jones Rules Over Slow Holiday WeekendCG gophers no deterrent for moviegoers worldwide.by Gitesh Pandya | May 26, 2008 |  CommentsHarrison Fordscored his first number one opening in eight years with the much-hyped adventuresequel Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skullwhich dominated moviegoing over the Memorial Day holiday weekend grossing morethan all other films in the marketplace combined. But despite the explosivestart for the long-awaited return of Indy, the rest of the box office slumpedwith few strong performances from supporting players. Overall it was the slowestMemorial Day weekend in five years.19 years after the last installment, the Indiana Jones franchise provedthat it was still relevant in today’s entertainment world as Crystal Skull opened to a stunning $126M over the four-dayFriday-to-Monday holiday period, according to estimates. The Friday-to-Sundayportion accounted for $101M and since the Paramount release’s Thursday launchthe cume has soared to $151.1M in five days. Playing in 4,260 locations, thePG-13 pic averaged a sensational $23,709 over three days and $29,587 over fourdays.The Friday-to-Sunday figure ranks as the tenth highest debut in box officehistory while the cume is the sixth best five-day start ever. The only otherfilms to gross more in their first five days of release were Star Wars Episode III($172.8M, Thu-Mon), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest ($169.5M, Fri-Tue), Spider-Man 3($169.4M, Fri-Tue), Pirates ofthe Caribbean: At World’s End ($153M, Thu previews-Mon), and Spider-Man 2($152.4M, Wed-Sun). Not bad company. The $185M-budgeted Kingdom alsoenjoyed the second largest Memorial Day weekend opening ever after last year’sAt World’s End which looted $139.8M over its official Friday-to-Mondayperiod.Crystal Skull marked the reunion ofHarrison Fordwith directorSteven Spielbergand executive producer George Lucaswhile newcomers like Shia LaBeoufand Cate Blanchettjoined the cast for this fourth escapade. Reviews were mixed but generallypositive. The five-day opening began with $25M on Thursday. Friday saw a 24%increase to $31M, Saturday jumped another 19% to $37M, Sunday dipped by 11% to$33M, and the studio is estimating a 24% Monday decline to $25M.The new Indiana Jones adventure also attacked multiplexes around theworld and grossed a stellar $160M internationally since its first launches onWednesday. Indy ranked number one in all 61 territories it opened in andbrought its global cume to $311M in less than one week of play.Last week’s top film The Chronicles ofNarnia: Prince Caspian tumbled in its second weekend of release to anestimated $28.6M over four days as the Friday-to-Sunday portion collapsed by ahorrific 58%. It was the worst gross in nine years for the second place filmover Memorial Day weekend. In 1999, Notting Hillclaimed that spot with $27.7M over four days behind chart-topper Star WarsEpisode I. However, that amount would be about $38M at today’s prices so thenew Narnia still sold fewer tickets.Caspian boosted its 11-day total to $96.7M and looks as if it will topout at $140-150M from North America or about half of the $291.7M that The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe grossed. This is a major stumblefor Disney which has been developing Narnia as a long-term franchise meant tokeep revenue flowing in for several years to come.The year’s top-grossing smash Iron Manfinished its fourth weekend in third with a strong $25.7M over four days,according to estimates, and watched its cume skyrocket to $257.8M. The three-dayportion dropped by just 37%. Paramount and Marvel continued to benefit fromsolid word-of-mouth as the super hero flick raced up to number 40 on the list ofall-time domestic blockbusters surpassing I Am Legend‘s $256.4M. Withboth Iron Man and Indiana Jones rocking the holiday box office,Paramount dominated the multiplexes accounting for a whopping 72% of the entiretop ten. The Robert Downey Jr. sensation is a virtual lock to join the $300Mclub now.Moviegoers looking for a comedy over the long weekend found it in theCameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcherpic What Happens in Vegaswhich took in an estimated $11.2M over four days. Meanwhile Speed Racercontinued to crash and burn falling to an estimated $5.2M. Each film was in itsthird weekend. Totals stand at a robust $56.4M for the Fox hit and a miserable$37.4M for the pricey Warner Bros. entry.Both Speed Racer and Prince Caspian were expected to add muscularnumbers to the May box office but moviegoers have not been too impressed. Theweaker-than-expected openings and the steep declines have led to a lack of depthin the marketplace as the Memorial Day frame usually sees strong contributionsfrom a number of different films.Universal’s pregnancy comedy Baby Mamaheld up well again grossing an estimated $4.2M in four days boosting the overalltake to $53M. Also laughing up the same estimated amount was the romantic comedy Made of Honorraising Sony’s cume to $40M.Forgetting Sarah Marshallwas still remembered by audiences in its sixth frame taking in an estimated$2.2M for a $58.7M total for Universal. New Line’s Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bayfollowed with an estimated $1.2M in its fifth outing for a $36.2M sum. Roundingout the top ten was the indie hit The Visitorwith an estimated $917,000 lifting the cume to $4.6M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $209.4M over four days which was down 14%from last year when Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End opened in the topspot with $139.8M; and down 9% from 2006 when X-Men: The Last Stand debuted atnumber one with $102.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"HBO, Country, revenge, Comedy, York, Hear, worst, El, Awards, DirecTV, Quiz, breaking, Fall","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Indiana-Jones-Rules-Over-Slow-Holiday-Weekend"},{"id":"47509146320888","title":"Critics Consensus: No Go for Speed Racer, Vegas Cashes Out","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: No Go for Speed Racer, Vegas Cashes OutAlso, Redbelt mostly hits its mark.by Tim Ryan | May 8, 2008 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got fast cars (Speed Racer,starring EmileHirsch and Christina Ricci),marital mishaps (What Happens in Vegas,starringAshton Kutcher andCameron Diaz),and battle royals (David Mamet‘s Redbelt,starringChiwetel Ejiofor).What do the critics have to say?Sing along with me: “Here it comes, here comes Speed Racer / It’s gettingbad reviews….” The critics say the Wachowski brothers’ big-screen adaptation ofthe old-school toon is loaded with flashy visuals, but is too bombastic andthinly plotted to resonate. Emile Hirsch stars as the titular hero, who, withthe support of main squeeze Trixie (Christina Ricci), battles it out it out withRacer X (Matthew Fox) in a cross-county road race that Speed learns is beingunfairly influenced by corporate interests. The pundits say Speed Racer istoo loaded with eye-popping (some say headache-inducing) visuals and too shorton character development and coherent plotting. At 32 percent on theTomatometer, you may not want to go (Speed Racer) go to this one. (Checkout this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down the greatest movie cars ofall time.)“Rotten!”How much mileage can a movie get out of the appeal of its stars? With regard toWhat Happens in Vegas, the critics say quite a bit — though perhaps notenough to deal this formulaic romantic comedy a winning hand.Ashton Kutcher andCameron Diaz star as a pair of strangers who stumble into matrimony afterhitting the jackpot; what follows is a battle of the sexes and a tug-of-war overthe money. The pundits say Diaz and Kutcher display solid comedic chops, but arelet down by a predictable plot and a sour undercurrent. At 50 percent on theTomatometer, you have even odds of enjoying this one.“I doubt that’s going to fit in the ATM slot.”With a gift for cryptic language and complex characterization,David Mamet isone of America’s most celebrated playwrights. It turns out he’s also a bigmartial arts fan. In Redbelt, Mamet’s passions collide, and critics sayit’s a solid, if not spectacular, combination.Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as aJiu-Jitsu teacher who preaches self-defense; however, after an accident new hisschool triggers a series of ominous events, he’s forced to step into the ring.The pundits say Redbelt features many of the strengths of Mamet’s work:strong acting (from a cast that includes Joe Mantegna,Emily Mortimer, andTimAllen), intriguing moral dilemmas, and rich dialogue. But some say it’s a littletoo tightly scripted to be fully believable. Still, at 64 percent, the scribessay Redbelt hits pretty hard.“For next year’s fundraiser, we should just have a cops vs. firemenbasketball game!”Also opening this week in limited release:Refusnik, a documentary about longstanding activist efforts to help Jewsin the Soviet Union, is at 100 percent.Turn the River, starringFamke Janssen as a pool hustler working to getback the son she gave up at birth, is at 88 percent.The MemoryThief, starring Mark Webber and Rachel Miner in the tale of a man whobecomes obsessed with the Holocaust, is at 86 percent.Monster Camp,a doc about live action role playing, is at 83 percent.OSS117: Cairo, Nest of Spies, a parody of espionage thrillers, is at 75percent.The Merchant-Ivory period drama, Before theRains, about a cross-cultural love affair in 1930s India, is at 50percent.Battle forHaditha, Nick Broomfield s chronicle of a dark campaign in the Iraq war,is at 44 percent.Noise, starring Tim Robbins in a comedy about a man who loses it afterbeing inundated with street sounds, is at 44 percent.The French slasher import,Frontier(s), abouta group of criminals who stumble into a house full of flesh-eaters, is at 43percent.The TraceyFragments, starringEllen Page ina dark comedy about a teenager searching for her brother, is at 40 percent.The Fall, a fantasy film about strange goings-on in a Los Angeleshospital, is at 42 percent.The Babysitters, starringJohn Leguizamo and Cynthia Nixon in comedyabout a girl who stars a sitting/callgirl business, is at 34 percent.“Patti Smith or Sonic Youth?”Wachowski Brothers Movies:—————————————-37% — The Matrix Revolutions (2003)73% — The Matrix Reloaded (2003)86% — The Matrix (1999)88% — Bound (1996)","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"biography, movie, crime, award, thriller, series, Adventures, YouTube, supernatural, Apple, tv, Awards, Winter, Schedule","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-No-Go-for-Speed-Racer-Vegas-Cashes-Out"},{"id":"47509146307570","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: WALL-E and Jolie: Box Office Power Couple","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: WALL-E and Jolie: Box Office Power CoupleThe lonely robot rocks the boxoffice.by Gitesh Pandya | June 29, 2008 |  CommentsMetal ruled the North American box office as the robot adventure WALL-E and the assassin thriller Wanted featuring a gun-toting Angelina Jolie rocked the multiplexes hauling in an eye-popping $114M in combined ticket sales. It was the first time in history that two films opened with more than $50M each on the same weekend. Powered by the explosive openings of the pair of new releases, the weekend box office climbed to its highest point yet in 2008.Robot love was in the air as moviegoers powered WALL-E into the number one spot with an estimated $62.5M in ticket sales. Playing in 3,992 sites, the G-rated space adventure averaged a sizzling $15,656 per theater and gave Pixar its ninth consecutive top spot debut. It was the eighth largest opening ever for an animated film and the fourth highest for Pixar after The Incredibles ($70.5M in 2004), Finding Nemo ($70.3M in 2003), and Monsters, Inc. ($62.6M in 2001). It was the third best bow for a G-rated film after (Nemo and Monsters) and WALL-E also gave Disney its biggest opening in over a year. Film critics were in awe with the computer-animated pic giving it some of the best reviews of any film this year.Pixar’s last film Ratatouille opened to $47M this weekend a year ago and was equally loved by critics, but featured a premise involving a rat cooking in a kitchen which turned off some audiences. The company’s previous effort Cars bowed to $60.1M in early June 2006 and featured a better premise, but got mixed reactions from critics. This time around, WALL-E successfully delivered a story that could be universally loved and was applauded by reviewers. It even overcame the liability of having very little human dialogue. With a CinemaScore grade of A plus a major holiday weekend coming up for Independence Day, long-term prospects look solid as positive word-of-mouth is sure to spread.The lonely robot kicked off its weekend with a potent $23.1M on Friday, Saturday sales dipped by 5% to $22M, while Sunday was estimated to drop by 21% to $17.4M. The Saturday decline was a bit unusual, but could be attributed to the upfront demand on Friday when most children were out of school. Studio research showed that 51% of the audience was female while 59% was under 25. Disney did report a high number of couples without children indicating that WALL-E is not only playing as a family film but as a date movie too.Angelina Jolie‘s latest high-octane action vehicle Wanted may have settled for second place, but the Universal release scored a sensational debut that soared above all expectations. The R-rated pic launched with an estimated $51.1M over the weekend from 3,175 locations for a scorching average of $16,100 per theater. It was the seventh largest opening in box office history for any R-rated film and marks a new career high for the actress for a live-action opener. Her previous bests were also June action titles – 2005’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith ($50.3M) and 2001’s Lara Croft: Tomb Raider ($47.7M). Legally speaking, Jolie did not get top billing in Wanted but instead was third-billed in the credits after James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman and received the ‘and’ credit in the titles. Reviews were mostly positive.The tale of an ordinary office worker recruited by a secret group of elite assassins was sold as a stylish action picture and was backed by a slick marketing campaign that accented the visual effects in the film. Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Day Watch) put his unique stamp on the $75M production and word of Jolie’s nude scene certainly did not repel any ticket buyers. According to studio research, males made up 52% of the crowd while 51% was under 30. Friday started with a bang with a $19.2M opening day, Saturday slipped 8% to $17.6M, and Sunday is projected to fall 19% to $14.3M. Wanted also generated the third best opening for an R-rated summer film behind only The Matrix Reloaded ($91.8M in 2003) and Sex and the City ($56.8M last month).Universal also rolled out the assassin pic in 22 international territories and grossed an estimated $33M giving Wanted an explosive global debut of $84.1M. Russia led the way with $11M, the U.K shot up $8M, and South Korea kicked in $6.7M. The hit film is part of the studio’s summer slate of action entries along with The Incredible Hulk from earlier this month, July’s Hellboy II, and August’s The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.WALL•E and Wanted capped off a sensational June box office that was on fire from start to finish. The marketplace could not be in better shape as it heads into the second half of 2008 which begins with the Fourth of July holiday session which gets an early start at 7pm on Tuesday night with the first showings of Will Smith‘s superhero actioner Hancock.Dropping from first to third was the action-comedy remake Get Smart with an estimated $20M in its second weekend. Off 48%, the Steve Carell vehicle lost an understandable amount of business given the competition from new releases. The $80M-budgeted film has now grossed $77.3M in its first ten days and seems set to finish with $125-135M for Warner Bros.The arrival of WALL•E prompted a larger decline than normal for rival animation entry Kung Fu Panda which dipped 47% to an estimated $11.7M in its fourth frame. With $179.3M tallied for Paramount and DreamWorks, the Po pic is running 6% behind the pace of 2006’s June toon Cars which raced to $190.5M at this same point in its release.Universal’s The Incredible Hulk continues to show rapid audience erosion falling 58% in its third session to an estimated $9.2M. The Edward Norton starrer has smashed up $115.5M in 17 days putting it a scant 1% behind the pace of 2003’s Hulk which stood at $117M at the same point in its run.Mike Myers saw his latest comedy The Love Guru tumble 61% to an estimated $5.4M lifting the ten-day total to just $25.3M. The $60M production looks to end up with only $35-40M for Paramount.Studio stablemate Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull came within a hair of joining the triple century club this weekend thanks to another solid hold. The Harrison Ford adventure dropped 41% and collected an estimated $5M in its sixth weekend boosting the cume to a stunning $299.9M. Add in Iron Man, Transformers and Shrek the Third and by Monday Paramount will have distributed four of the last five megahits to break the $300M barrier. Crystal Skull now sits at number 28 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters after Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl which grossed $305.4M in 2003.M. Night Shyamalan‘s eco-thriller The Happening collapsed another 63% to an estimated $3.9M for a $59.1M total for Fox. Sex and the City followed with an estimated $3.8M, off 42%, giving New Line and Warner Bros. an impressive $140.1M to date. Adam Sandler rounded out the top ten with Sony’s You Don’t Mess With the Zohan which dropped 57% to an estimated $3.2M giving the comedy $91.2M. Though a solid number, it is the worst total for one of the actor’s broad comedies after the fourth weekend since 2000’s Little Nicky.A pair of May success stories dropped out of the top ten this weekend. The year’s biggest blockbuster Iron Man finally fell out of the elite list in its ninth frame but still grossed an estimated $2.3M.

Overall, themarketplace stayed strong with the top ten beating year-ago levels by more than30% for the third consecutive weekend.Shooting higher than the loftiest of expectations, Disney’s Hannah Montana film commanded an estimated $29M in ticket sales thisweekend from only 683 theaters for an eye-popping $42,460 average setting a newrecord for the Super Bowl frame. Presented in digital 3D cinemas, with 96% ofthe sites featuring RealD technology, the grosses were boosted by mostexhibitors charging $15 per ticket instead of the usual admission charges.Still, the G-rated film more than doubled its nearest competitor and sold outover a thousand showtimes during the weekend. The release was not as wide asother films since Disney was limited to only those auditoriums equipped with thenecessary facilities to project in digital 3D.Hannah Montana set a number of new box office milestones althoughasterisks will need to be added to the record books since it had the advantageof the higher-priced tickets. It was the largest opening ever over Super Bowlweekend beating the $21.6M of 2006’s horror entry When a StrangerCalls, and the largest overall weekend gross over this frame surpassingTitanicwhich banked $25.2M in 1998 in its sixth weekend. The gross for the icebergromance would be over $36M at today’s regular prices. Hannah also set therecord for the smallest amount of theaters for a film debuting at number one.Best of Both Worlds offered fans many reasons to rush out and grab aseat. Given the star’s 69-city sold-out concert tour, the film allowed Hannahlovers an easier way to see their favorite singer locally without having to getparents to buy scalped tickets. Add in the digital 3D presentation and thepromotion of an exclusive one-week-only run and ticket buyers wasted no time inmaking sure they got their stubs and showed up. An event film was born. Due tothe incredible demand, the studio has now announced that the film will beopen-ended and will play beyond the initial seven-day run.Sales were exceptional right out of the gate with Friday delivering a stunning$8.6M in business. Saturday saw incredible strength with matinee business fromkids going on their parents’ first day off from work with sales surging anamazing 52% to $13.1M. The studio has estimated that Sunday’s grosses will dropby 45% to $7.3M. Most studios are estimating larger-than-normal declines of60-65% on Sunday for their films because of the Super Bowl, however HannahMontana‘s young female audience is least likely to care about the big gameso its drop should be lighter.Studio research indicated few surprises in the audience turnout. Females made upa whopping 84% of the crowd and those under the age of 25 accounted for 70%.Reviews were generally upbeat for the trim 74-minute concert film which allowedtheaters to schedule plenty of showtimes over the weekend to absorb demand.Hollywood’s annual Super Bowl weekend horror offering had to settle for therunnerup prize. The Eye,a remake of a Hong Kong horror hit with Jessica Albaanchoring the U.S. version, bowed to an estimated $13M from 2,436 locations fora solid $5,357 average. The PG-13 pic about a blind violinist who gainssupernatural visions of death after an eye transplant played slightly more toyoung women as the audience was 56% female, according to studio research.Lionsgate grossed $4.9M on Friday, edged up 16% to $5.7M on Saturday, andestimated a 58% drop on Sunday to $2.4M. The Eye debuted with more thantwice as much as Alba’s last thrillerAwake ($5.9M) and was inline with the $13.7M launch of her recent romantic comedy Good Luck Chuck.&nbsp;Fox’s 27 Dressesheld steady in third place and played as a great non-football alternative forwomen by grossing an estimated $8.4M in its third weekend.

The Disney adventuresequel National Treasure: Book of Secrets held steady at number one for thesecond straight time grossing an estimated $35.6M. Dropping a reasonable 20%,the PG-rated actioner saw its ten-day total soar to $124M. Nicolas Cage‘sfranchise pic averaged a terrific $9,299 from 3,832 playdates. Book ofSecrets has already broken into the Top 20 chart of this year’s blockbustersand stands a chance of reaching the Top 10. That would be fitting since five ofthe six biggest hits of 2007 were sequels.Another PG-rated film catering to moviegoers of all ages followed in second.Fox’s family comedy sensation Alvin and the Chipmunks saw its weekend gross climb up 7% from lastweekend to an estimated $30M which boosted the cume to a stunning $142.4M inonly 17 days. If estimates hold, Alvin will become the first film in ayear and a half to gross $30M or more in its third weekend. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest was the last smash to do itback in July 2006. Alvin already sits at number 13 among all blockbustersfrom 2007 and is Fox’s second-biggest hit of the year after the $183.1M of The Simpsons Movie.Will Smith‘smegahit I Am Legendcollected an estimated $27.5M in its third weekend, off 18%, pushing itssensational total to $194.6M after 17 days. The Warner Bros. blockbuster is justa couple of days away from becoming the ninth blockbuster of 2007 to cross the$200M mark edging out 2005’s eight to set a new industry record. NationalTreasure and Alvin could both still join the club by the end of theirruns. Together the three end-of-year behemoths have grossed a combined $461M andcounting giving the year an explosive finish.Leading all films for mature adults was Charlie Wilson’sWar with an estimated $11.8M which was up a healthy 22% from lastweekend’s opening frame. With Christmas over and grown-ups having more availabletime, theTom Hanks–JuliaRoberts pic upped its cume to a decent $34.5M which was almost identical tothe $35.1M that the studio saw exactly a year ago from its CIA drama The Good Shepherdin its first ten days which also included the yuletide holiday week. Thatpolitical saga appealed to much the same audience and went on to gross $59.9Mdomestically. War cost $75M to produce.Indie darling Juno continued tooverwhelm at the box office leaping up into the number five slot with anestimated $10.3M despite playing in only 998 theaters. Every film above it onthe charts is in at least 2,500 sites. The teen pregnancy tale averaged astill-superb $10,321 in its fourth frame and pushed the sum up to a remarkable$25.7M. Juno is already outperforming Fox Searchlight’s dysfunctionalfamily comedy hit from last year Little MissSunshine which in its fourth frame grossed $5.6M from its expansion into691 locations for a $8,120 average and $12.7M total. With buzz snowballing,kudos attention becoming more focused, and a long awards season still ahead ofit, Juno looks to challenge Sunshine and 2004’s Sideways to becomethe distributor’s highest-grossing film ever. Those Oscar-winning comediesbanked $59.9M and $71.5M, respectively.Opening in sixth place was the sci-fi action sequel Alien vs Predator: Requiemwith an estimated $10.1M over the weekend and $26.9M over the six-day debutperiod since its Christmas Day launch on Tuesday. Attacking 2,611 sites, theR-rated pic averaged a mild $3,849 and skewed male to nobody’s surprise. Thesix-day bow still fell short of the $38.3M three-day opening of 2004’s Alien vs. Predatorwhich carried a PG-13 rating and launched in the late summer period.Sony was close behind in seventh with the opening of its fantasy adventuretale The WaterHorse which grossed an estimated $9.2M over the weekend and $16.8Mover six days. Over the three-day period, the PG-rated tale averaged a lukewarm$3,319 per site in 2,772 locations. The Loch Ness Monster saga played mostly tokids and families.Enjoying a sturdy bump from last weekend was the romance P.S. I Love Youwhich took in an estimated $9.1M climbing 40% from it unimpressive bow lastweekend. Warner Bros. has banked $23.4M in ten days and is finally reaching itscore audience of adult women now that holiday distractions have gone by.TheJohnny Deppmusical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Streetdropped 14% to anestimated $8M in its second weekend. The $50M Paramount release has taken in$26.7M in ten days. Disney’s less gory music-filled offering Enchantedrounded out the top ten with an estimated $6.5M, up a charming 54%, to a totalof $110.7M.Opening just outside the top ten with a surprisingly soft bow wasDenzelWashington‘s directorial and starring effort The Great Debaterswith an estimated $6.3M from 1,171 sites for a decent $5,383 average. Producedby OprahWinfrey and co-starringForestWhitaker, the PG-13 film has collected an unimpressive $13.5M in the sixdays since its Christmas Day bow which is below what Washington usually seeswith his films. The Oprah factor was also expected to provide more of acommercial boost.Delivering the highest opening weekend average of the year, ParamountVantage’s oil baron saga There Will BeBlood exploded in just two theaters grossing an estimated $186,000for an eye-popping $92,763 average.

The testosterone flick Never Back Down launched to decent numbers; however, the virus thriller Doomsday was dead on arrival in its debut. But ‘toon power was able to revitalize the marketplace, sending the top 10 above the $100M mark and ahead of year-ago levels for the first time in a month.Jim Carrey and Steve Carell lent their voices to Horton and ticket buyers responded, spending an estimated $45.1M on the Fox hit for a strong number one premiere. The G-rated tale bowed ultrawide in 3,954 locations and averaged a sturdy $11,406 per theater. The Whoville story generated the fourth best March opening ever, behind 300 ($70.9M), Ice Age: The Meltdown ($68M), and the original Ice Age ($46.3M) and also landed the fifth largest opening in history for a G-rated film.Horton took advantage of star power, the popularity of the Seuss brand, and an open marketplace with few options for families to help it post the year’s best debut. But the film went beyond just parents and kids — the studio reports that 47 percent of the audience was non-family, with teens kicking in a significant contribution. Budgeted at $85M, the animated feature also garnered glowing reviews from most critics. Horton also bowed in 29 international markets this weekend, and captured an estimated $14.2M tally.Animated films opening in March usually enjoy strong legs thanks to the Easter holiday and school vacations. Ice Age‘s opening weekend represented only 26 percent of its eventual $176.4M domestic final. Fox’s 2005 film Robots witnessed a 28 percent share, Meltdown played like a sequel and saw 35 percent, and last year’s Disney offering Meet the Robinsons grabbed 26 percent. Horton should follow in the same footsteps, as direct competition in the coing weeks is not too fierce, leading to possibly $150-175M from North America alone.Trailing the animated elephant were the woolly mammoths of 10,000 BC. The not-so-accurate account of prehistoric times fell 54 percent in its second outing to an estimated $16.4M and pushed the total to $61.2M after 10 days. Given the bad reviews, negative word-of-mouth and the genre, the sharp decline was expected. The Warner Bros. title is playing almost exactly like another spring historical actioner, 2002’s The Scorpion King. The Rock starrer generated similar numbers with a $36.1M debut and $61.3M 10-day take before concluding with $90.5M. 10,000 BC should find its way to the same vicinity domestically. Overseas, the prehistoric pic collected a mighty $38M this weekend as it saw top spot debuts in the United Kingdom, Korea, and Russia and second place launches in France and Italy. The international cume has risen to $73M putting the global gross at an impressive $134M.So far this year, moviegoers have been showing up in the same numbers, but have spread their dollars across a wider selection of movies than in 2007. Overall domestic box office is up 4 percent compared to the same period last year, and when factoring in the annual increase in ticket prices, total admissions are up only a slight amount. But at this point in 2007, six films had crossed the $50M mark, including three that broke the $100M barrier; this year, none have reached nine digits yet, but a whopping 10 have vaulted ahead of $50M (not including Horton, which is just days away from surpassing that mark).The Mixed Martial Arts drama Never Back Down debuted to mediocre results and landed in third place with an estimated $8.6M from a wide 2,729 theaters. Averaging a mild $3,155, the PG-13 high school tale is the first in-house production from new distributor Summit and played to an audience of young males. Research showed that 59 percent of the audience was male and 60 percent were under 21. Never was budgeted at $20M.Martin Lawrence’s second comedy of the year, College Road Trip, dropped a moderate 42 percent in its second weekend,, grossing an estimated $7.9M. With $24.3M collected in 10 days, the G-rated family flick should end up in the neighborhood of $45M.Sony’s action thriller Vantage Point has been enjoying surprisingly strong legs, and slipped only 27 percent this week, to an estimated $5.4M for a solid cume of $59.2M. Rival actioner The Bank Job posted an even greater hold, sliding only 17 percent in its sophomore frame to an estimated $4.9M, giving Lionsgate $13.1M in 10 days. The high-octane pics should reach about $75M and $27M, respectively.Universal suffered a dismal opening for its futuristic virus thriller Doomsday, which bowed to just $4.7M, according to estimates, from 1,936 theaters. The R-rated pic averaged a miserable $2,450 and should find its real audience on DVD this summer.Will Ferrell‘s basketball comedy Semi-Pro fell 49 percent to eighth with an estimated $3M, pushing the total for New Line to $29.8M. Look for a final of roughly $35M, making it the comedian’s lowest-grossing lead performance in a wide release since 1998’s Night at the Roxbury.Sony’s The Other Boleyn Girl dipped only 28 percent to an estimated $2.9M for a cume of $19.2M. The kidpic The Spiderwick Chronicles rounded out the top 10 with an estimated $2.4M, off 49 percent, for a $65.4M sum. Final grosses should reach $26M and $70M, respectively.Warner Independent had a mixed weekend with its pair of limited release titles. The Naomi Watts thriller Funny Games opened in 289 theaters and grossed an estimated $520,000 for a dull $1,800 average. But its promising platform release Snow Angels added one Los Angeles site and took in an estimated $26,000 from three sites for a potent $8,667 average. The Kate Beckinsale starrer expands to the top 10 on Friday during its third session.Three solid box office performers fell from the top 10 this weekend. Fox’s sci-fi flick Jumper dropped 42 percent to an estimated $2.1M, lifting the total to $75.8M. The $85M Hayden Christensen–Samuel L. Jackson actioner should conclude with about $80M. It’s already banked $100M overseas and counting.The $70M adventure comedy Fool’s Gold collected an estimated $1.7M, off 38 percent, for a $65.4M sum. Warner Bros. looks to end with just under $70M. Step Up 2 the Streets, the latest teen dance drama to score with audiences, took in an estimated $1.5M, down 51 percent. With $55.4M taken in thus far, the Buena Vista release will reach close to $60M, putting it within striking distance of the $65.3M gross of 2006’s surprise smash Step Up.The top 10 films grossed an estimated $101.3M, which was up less than 1 percent from last year — when 300 remained at number one in its second weekend with $32.9M — and up 13 percent from 2006, when V for Vendetta debuted in the top spot with $25.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"golden, story, saw, history, Disney, to, star, Set","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Horton-Hears-Cash-Registers-Ring-at-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509149075465","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Treasure Threepeats; Juno Grows Bigger","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Treasure Threepeats; Juno Grows BiggerMeanwhile, P.T. Anderson continues to draw box office blood.by Gitesh Pandya | January 6, 2008 |  CommentsMoviegoers continued to rush to the multiplexes to catch up on holidayholdovers as the North American box office kicked off 2008 with robust ticketsales that were led by mostly the same movies from last week. Nicolas Cage‘sadventure sequel National Treasure: Book of Secrets remained at number one for thethird straight frame, indie darling Juno grew evenbigger jumping into third place, and Hollywood’s only new release One Missed Callsettled for a fifth place finish although its debut was stronger than expected.Uncovering an estimated $20.2M in its third expedition, the new National Treasure installment retained its box office crown dropping45% from last weekend. After only 17 days of release, the Disney blockbuster hasalready grossed a stunning $171M nearly matching the $173M that the first filmgrossed during its six-month run in theaters. Book of Secrets shouldsurpass that total on Monday or Tuesday and become Cage’s top-grossing filmever.The PG-rated adventure also raced past the studio’s own hit Wild Hogs to ranknumber 12 among all of 2007’s blockbuster hits. Secrets should crack thetop ten by next weekend joining a long list of other sequels which dominatedmoviegoing last year. At its current pace, the Cage smash should end up in theneighborhood of $220M domestically. Overseas, Book of Secrets brokethrough the $100M mark this weekend and stands at a global tally of $271.6M andcounting.There was a tight three-way race for the silver medal this weekend betweenthe last man on earth, a pregnant teen, and a trio of chipmunks. Studioestimates put them within $375,000 of each other and rankings could change onMonday once all of Sunday’s votes are counted.Narrowly taking second place with an estimated $16.4M wasWill Smith‘ssuperhit IAm Legend dropping 40%. With a towering $228.7M in 24 days, theaction hit has become the third biggest blockbuster in the A-list actor’s careertrailing his mid-90s alien smashes IndependenceDay ($306.2M) and Men in Black($250.1M). Legend now ranks as the sixth highest-grossing film of 2007and the second biggest non-sequel afterTransformers($319.1M). Overseas, the Warner Bros. actioner enjoyed big number one bows inAustralia, New Zealand, and Greece and boosted its cume to $170.2M putting theglobal tally at just under $400M. In North America, Legend seems oncourse to conclude with $260-270M.Fox Searchlight gave a major expansion to its runaway hit comedy Juno widening itfrom 1,019 to 1,925 locations and grossed an estimated $16.2M over the weekend.The per-theater average dipped by only 19% to a sturdy $8,429. Independent filmsthat expand this wide rarely retain such strong averages. Word of mouth has beenpropelling Juno on the charts and the PG-13 high school tale continues tofind new fans, especially with young women. The cume to date shot up to aremarkable $52M with sizable potential still ahead.Juno now looks set to reach a couple of major milestones at the boxoffice. It will easily surpass the $71.5M of Sideways to becomethe highest grossing film in company history for Searchlight. At its currentpace, the $2.5M-budgeted pregnancy pic will smash through the $100M mark andcould go much higher depending on added buzz the film may receive from GoldenGlobe wins and Oscar nominations. TheEllen Page hitmay even challenge Disney’sAmy Adams comedy Enchanted to become the top-grossing female-led film of the year.Right behind with an estimated $16M was Fox’s comedy sensation Alvinand the Chipmunks which dropped by 45% in its fourth frame. ThePG-rated family film has now collected a massive $176.7M and is less than a weekaway from surpassing the $183.1M of The Simpsons Movieto become the studio’s top-grossing film of 2007. It will also become one oflast year’s top ten overall blockbusters when it beats Homer and pals. Budgetedat under $70M, Alvin should zoom past the double century mark and finishwith $210-220M.The weekend’s only new release found itself with a solid fifth place debut. One Missed Call,a remake of a Japanese horror film, grossed an estimated $13.5M from 2,240theaters for a strong $6,038 average. The PG-13 film was expected to open withless than $10M. Warner Bros. marketed Call as a creepy thriller for teensand young adults and scored impressive results. Not facing any other new openersalso helped.&nbsp;Tom Hanksand JuliaRoberts found themselves in sixth place with the political dramedy Charlie Wilson’sWar which dropped only 32% to an estimated $8.2M. Universal’s $75MGolden Globe nominee has grossed $52.6M to date and should finish with $70-75M.Close behind with an estimated $8M was theHilary Swank–GerardButler romance P.S. I Love Youwhich enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten slipping only 14%. After aslow start, audiences are finding the Warner Bros. title which has taken in$39.4M thus far. A final tally of $60-65M seems likely.The kid adventure The WaterHorse followed with an estimated $6.3M, off only 31%, for a take of$30.9M. Look for roughly $50M by the end of its run.Johnny Depp‘sblood-soaked musical barber pic Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street fell 34% to anestimated $5.4M for a $38.5M cume.

Martin Lawrence’s new comedy Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins enjoyed a solidsecond place finish, but the standup concert film Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show bombed in its opening finishing well outside the top ten.Uncovering the most treasure, Fool’s Gold premiered in the top spot over theweekend with an estimated $22M from 3,125 theaters for a strong $7,043 average.The debut for the Warner Bros. release was a bit below the $23.8M opening thatthe two actors generated for their romantic comedy How To Lose A Guy in 10 Dayswhich launched five years ago this weekend. That figure would be roughly $27M attoday’s ticket prices.The $70M-budgeted Gold, which features the stars as an estranged couplereuniting to hunt for sunken treasure, was panned by critics and received someof the worst reviews of any film released in this new year. Andy Tennant (Hitch, Sweet Home Alabama) directed. In the half-decade since10 Days came out, Hudsonhas been absent from the box office throne while McConaughey headlined twonumber one openers – 2005’s adventure Sahara and 2006’s romantic comedy Failureto Launch.Debuting in second place with a nearly identical performance on a per-theaterbasis was the Martin Lawrence-led comedyWelcome Home Roscoe Jenkins with anestimated $17.1M from 2,386 locations for a solid $7,180 average. The Universalrelease played in 739 fewer theaters than Fool’s Gold and posted an average thatwas $137 higher. Directed by Malcolm D.

Cedric the Entertainer, James Earl Jones, Michael Clarke Duncan, Mike Epps, and Mo’Nique co-star.Produced for $35M, Roscoe Jenkins generated an opening similar to last month’sFirst Sunday which was another comedy led by an African American cast. That picwhich starred Ice Cube bowed to $17.7M from 2,213 theaters andis headed for a finish of just under $40M. According to Fox research, Roscoe‘saudience was 52% female and 52% over the age of 30.Despite its A grade from CinemaScore, Disney’s Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert plunged 66% in its second weekend to an estimated $10.5Mranking third for the frame. The G-rated concert film played in only 687theaters and still averaged a sizzling $15,295 per location and boosted itsten-day cume to a fantastic $53.4M. Hannah Montana was originally promoted as aone-week-only event and racked up record pre-sales over the past two months soit was expected to absorb most of the demand in the first seven days. The studioannounced last Sunday that it would extend the run. With a reported budget of$7M, the 3D tween sensation could climb to an astounding $70-75M. Most theatersare charging an extra-high $15 per ticket.Jessica Alba‘s horror pic The Eye held up reasonably well in its second weekendfalling 47% to an estimated $6.6M. The $22M Lionsgate title has grossed $21.5Min ten days and should see itself ending up in the neighborhood of $35M.More female starpower followed as a pair of funny ladies from Fox tied for fifthplace with an estimated $5.7M each. Oscar contender Junoslipped only 18% andboosted its cume to an amazing $117.6M. The wise-cracking pregnant teen is theeldest stateswoman in the top ten having just entered her tenth weekend.

TheDanielDay-Lewis oilsaga There Will BeBlood expanded and saw its weekend milkshake dip by just 13%.Paramount Vantage has taken in $26.8M to date with much more expected in theweeks ahead as moviegoers catch up on high profile Academy Award contenders.Opening miserably outside of the top ten was the standup comedy doc Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show which debuted to an estimated $507,000 from 962locations for an embarrassingly low $527 average. Scoring an opening weekendaverage of just three digits is never a good thing. The R-rated Picturehouserelease follows the comic actor and his group of standup comedians on their touracross several states.Grossing a similar amount of money from just a tiny fraction of the theaterswas the Colin Farrell hitman dramaIn Bruges which bowed in just 28 locations to anestimated $471,000 for a solid $16,829 average.

The horrorpicture One MissedCall will give fans of scary movies something new to nibble on. Awardscontenders will continue to expand including indie sensation Juno which will addhundreds of new theaters to its run. Overall, the healthy marketplace shouldpost a year-over-year gain versus 2007 to kick off the new year on the rightnote.Hoping to capture some of the success that The Ring enjoyed ahalf-decade ago, Warner Bros. unleashes the new supernatural thriller One Missed Call.The PG-13 film is a remake of a hit Japanese chiller about young adults whoreceive voicemail recordings of their own deaths shortly before they are killed.Fright films like these typically become winners through two important elements– a creepy plot and strong marketing. One Missed Call has both. Trailersand television spots have been very effective in communicating the storyline andthey’ve been edited well enough to give the target audience the chills.Marketplace conditions are also favorable since there are no other horrorfilms out there plus no competing new releases this weekend either. Teens andyoung adults are the main audience and they are done with the Fresh Prince’sturn as the last man on Earth and are ready to go see something new. And sincemost college students are still on winter break, look for a solid showing fromthat segment. Plus a trim running time of under 90 minutes will ensure plenty ofshowtimes.The first non-holiday weekend of January proved to be just the right time toopen two other recent horror hits. In 2006, the R-rated Hostel bowed to $19.6Mand a $8,909 average while a year earlier White Noise withits PG-13 classification bowed to $24.1M and a stellar $10,665 average. However,last January was a tough one for fright flicks as Primeval openedlater in the month to only $6M and a $2,475 average and The Hitcher debutedto just $7.8M and a $2,758 average. Opening in 2,240 theaters, One Missed Callcould open to about $9M.Fox Searchlight will give another major expansion to its hot indie smash Juno which willtry to climb one more chart position this weekend. The PG-13 film has been on atear since going nationwide on Christmas Day becoming a feel-good hit for thearthouse crowd and beyond. On Friday, Juno widens from 1,019 to 1,880locations. Look for its average of $10,436 to simmer down to about $7,000 inthis frame resulting in a solid $13M weekend gross which again would be thebiggest of its run so far. The total would rise to $49M with the road aheadleading past the $100M mark.With only one new film going into release,Nicolas Cagehopes to make it three straight weekends atop the box office charts with National Treasure: Book of Secrets. The Disney smash could drop by40% to about $22M lifting the cume to an amazing $171M which would be withinstriking distance of the $173M of its 2004 predecessor.Like Treasure, Alvinand the Chipmunks also faces virtually no competition from OneMissed Call. The Fox comedy might fall by 35% to roughly $19M which wouldpush the total to $176M.Sci-fi megahit IAm Legend has become the third biggest grosser ofWill Smith‘scareer and its cume is still climbing higher. Warner Bros. could see a 40% dropto around $16M for a gross to date of $227M. The quarter-billion markdomestically is still within its reach. Overseas, Legend has vaulted to $126Malready so the $400M worldwide barrier could crumble this weekend.Tom Hanksand JuliaRoberts enjoyed a healthy post-Christmas bump for Charlie Wilson’sWar which mature audiences are now finding. Universal’s 1980s-setflick may drop by 30% to $8M for an overall sum of $52M.LAST YEAR: For the third consecutive weekend,Ben Stillerand Will Smith dominated the multiplexes with their latest films. Night at theMuseum topped the charts once again and grossed $23.7M in its thirdframe while The Pursuit of Happyness ranked second with $12.9M in its fourth outing.The blockbuster duo had grossed a combined $288M to date and eventually reached$414M together. Universal’s futuristic drama Children of Menexpanded nationally and opened in third with a strong $10.2M and $8,435 average.Paramount’s Hilary Swank drama Freedom Writersdebuted in fourth with a solid $9.4M and $6,916 average.

Opening in semi-national release, the period romance The Other Boleyn Girlperformed well but the comedy Penelopestumbled and barely made the top ten.Ferrell’s latest attempt to mine laughs out of sports came in the form of Semi-Prowhich opened atop the charts this weekend to an estimated $15.3M. The New Linerelease averaged a decent $4,906 from 3,121 sites but did not match the numbersof the funnyman’s other recent hits like Blades of Glory($33M), Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby($47M), and Anchorman($28.4M). Those were all rated PG-13 allowing the comedian’s teen fans to buytickets while Semi-Pro carried the more restrictive R which most likely affectedticket sales. It was the lowest gross for a number one film sinceJodie Foster‘sThe Brave Onewhich debuted to $13.5M last September.Sony’s hit assassination thriller Vantage Pointfell to second place but enjoyed a good hold dropping 43% to an estimated $13M.The ensemble actioner has banked a terrific $41M in ten days and has benefitedfrom a highly effective marketing push by the studio. Look for a domestic finalof $70-75M.Holding up even better was the fantasy adventure The Spiderwick Chronicleswith an estimated $8.8M. The Paramount pic slipped only 33% and is takingadvantage of a marketplace lacking other options for families.Sony scored a solid debut for its period drama The Other Boleyn Girlwhich bowed to an estimated $8.3M from only 1,166 locations for an impressive$7,118 average. It was the best per-theater performance of any film in the Top20. Starring Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson,the PG-13 film played overwhelmingly to young women.

Summit debutedits Christina Riccipic Penelopein 1,196 locations and averaged a mild $3,349.

The science fiction thriller I Am Legend leads the way but will be joined by the family comedy Alvin and the Chipmunks and the romantic comedy The Perfect Holiday. For only the second time all year, just two films managed grosses of more than $5M last weekend. Hollywood critically needs this weekend to turn things around if it wants to end the year on a happy note.Gunning for his seventh consecutive number one opening, Will Smith headlines the sci-fi thriller I Am Legend, the latest Hollywood film based on the classic 1954 novel of the same name. The PG-13 entry finds the superstar playing the last man alive on Earth after a virus wipes out the entire human population in the not-so-distant future. Legend could prove to be Smith’s greatest box office challenge to date since there are no famous co-stars, no big director, and the novel it is based on is not exactly a hot item in today’s era. This film is Will’s to make or break.But for millions of movie fans, the former Fresh Prince plus action equals a definite trip to the local multiplex. The actor is right at the top of the current A list and is arguably the most bankable star alive consistently drawing in audiences that cut across all race, gender, and age barriers. Will Smith can bring out paying audiences for sci-fi (I, Robot), comedy (Hitch), drama (The Pursuit of Happyness), action (Bad Boys II), and animation (Shark Tale). With Legend he now flirts with the boundaries of horror as battling killer zombies that attack at night is a far cry from being a date doctor.Warner Bros. has good timing for I Am Legend. The marketplace has been about as dead as the world depicted in the film and audiences are hungry for an event film to get them back into the habit of moviegoing. Competition will not be much of a factor and business will be coming in from many directions with teens and young adults leading the way and fans of sci-fi and action delivering a big bang too. The studio’s massive marketing push will do the trick and adding more bite will be the simultaneous Imax release where higher ticket prices ($16 in New York City) will give the grosses a boost. Plus the strategic move of playing the new prologue for next summer’s much-anticipated Batman flick The Dark Knight with the Imax release of I Am Legend just fuels more excitement and guarantees more asses in the seats.Will Smith is looking to score one of the biggest December openings ever for a non-Peter Jackson flick. A big drop next weekend is likely, but for now consumers are keeping all eyes on I Am Legend which attacks 3,606 theaters on Friday. An opening weekend gross of about $50M could result.Will Smith and friend in I Am LegendSome younger moviegoers may not be in the mood for flesh-eating mutants. Luckily, Fox had the bright idea of getting jiggy with its new kidpic Alvin and the Chipmunks which will give parents and smaller children some harmless fun for the holidays. The PG-rated film is the latest big-screen treatment of a popular kids property from yesterday that gets a makeover for today’s sensibilities. When done right, ticket sales pour in from multiple generations. But when done wrong, you get disasters like The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.Competition should not be too bad since Enchanted which is going into its fourth session is the only family film generating any decent dough right now. Instead, holiday shopping may be the real threat as many parents will wait until a little later before heading to the cinemas for this one. The property is not popular enough to create any true sense of urgency. But this is common in mid December. Last year, Charlotte’s Web got off to a slow start with a $11.5M bow but went on to make seven times that amount with a final tally of $82.6M. Fox’s marketing push has been aggressively targeting young kids and the studio knows that little success lies with teens and young adults. Going very wide with 3,476 playdates on Friday, Alvin and the Chipmunks could gross about $15M this weekend but hold on well over the holidays.Alvin, Simon and TheodoreChristmas fun hits the multiplexes in another package with The Perfect Holiday from Yari Film Group. Morris Chestnut and Gabrielle Union star as single folks whose love lives cross while Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard play naughty and nice spirits along for the ride. The PG-rated film will play primarily to an African American audience which will make it a tricky sell at this moment in time. Though a very different film, Legend will steal away many in the target demographic and others who just saw This Christmas may not be looking for another story from the same category so soon. Poor reviews will also cause some box office headaches. Opening Wednesday in 1,306 locations, The Perfect Holiday could bow to about $7M over three days and $9M over five days.The Perfect HolidayAdding to the end-of-year frenzy that arthouse films find themselves in during awards season, Paramount Vantage’s The Kite Runner opens in 35 theaters in selected cities on Friday hoping to appeal to fans of the best-selling novel. The R-rated film in English and Dari tells of two young boys in Afghanistan whose lives take two very different paths after a violent incident right before the Soviet invasion of the country. Kite Runner has been included on some recent ten-best lists and scored two Golden Globe nominations. Reviews have been generally positive.The Kite RunnerFollowing its not-so-explosive debut, The Golden Compass will have tough work cut out for it during the sophomore frame. The New Line adventure will see the sci-fi audience abandon ship and line up for Will Smith while parents looking for some fun for their kids will have some talking chipmunks to consider. A 50% drop could be in order for Compass which would give it about $13M for the weekend and a ten-day tally of $45M.Disney’s Enchanted, which earned a pair of Golden Globe nominations, is slowly but surely making its way towards the $100M mark. Another moderate 35% decline would give the fairy tale pic around $7M which would push the sum up to $93M. Sony’s This Christmas will face direct competition from The Perfect Holiday so a 40% dip may result giving the pic $3M and $47M to date.LAST YEAR: The man in black beat out some tough competition to conquer the box office. Will Smith’s The Pursuit of Happyness led a wave of new releases with its top spot debut grossing $26.5M for Sony. The feel-good smash played well over the holiday season surging to $162.6M domestically and $294M worldwide – an impressive sum for a Smith vehicle not driven by guns or special effects. Fox’s fantasy actioner Eragon bowed close behind in second with $23.2M on its way to $75M from North America representing only 30% of the global take. Overseas the numbers were much stronger with $175M in ticket sales for a powerful $250M tally worldwide. Third place also featured a new release. Paramount’s family film Charlotte’s Web debuted to the tune of $11.5M but reached a solid $82.6M by the end of the run. Rounding out the top five were the penguin toon Happy Feet with $8.4M and the romantic comedy The Holiday with $8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"kong, Box, Searchlight, Month, 2017, canceled, Turner, Awards, park","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-I-Am-Legend-Set-For-Explosive-Opening"},{"id":"47509149095957","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: American Gangster Crushes Competition at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: American Gangster Crushes Competition at #1Denzel, Crowe, and Scott take over the multiplexes.by Gitesh Pandya | November 4, 2007 |  CommentsThe North American box office exploded thanks to the scorching debuts of theDenzelWashington–RussellCrowe crime drama American Gangsterand JerrySeinfeld‘s animated comedy Bee Movie whichcombined for over $85M in ticket sales. Following weeks of sluggish businesswhere the marketplace failed to match 2006 levels, this weekend’s box officeenjoyed a healthy bounce over last year and kicked off the holiday movie seasonwith a bang.Washington and Crowe both scored new career highs with the estimated $46.3Mopening weekend for the crime saga American Gangsterwhich dominated the multiplexes. Universal opened the R-rated tale in 3,054theaters and generated a scorching $15,175 average per location. Directed byRidley Scott,Gangster tells the true story of a drug kingpin who built up a heroin empire inHarlem in the early 1970s. The opening easily beat out the former all-timebiggest debuts for the Oscar-winning actors: Washington’s Inside Man with$29M and Crowe’s Gladiator with $34.8M.American Gangster enjoyed the second highest launch of the year for anR-rated film trailing only 300‘s$70.9M. Much of the success came from strong sales from young males and theurban audience which saw it as a Scarface fortoday’s generation. The same audience also helped to powerEminem‘s R-ratedhip hop drama 8 Mileto a surprising number one opening of $51.2M in November of 2002. Brian Grazerproduced both Mile and Gangster. Reviews were mostly favorable andearly Academy Award buzz could help the film in the weeks ahead. Despite thelong running time of nearly two hours and forty minutes, moviegoers lined up andfound their showtimes.Paramount and DreamWorks settled for a second place debut for their latestanimated film BeeMovie which grossed an estimated $39.1M in its opening weekend. ThePG-rated toon averaged a sturdy $9,954 from 3,928 locations and performed just abit below the levels of recent November animated titles. Last year, the penguinpic Happy Feetbowed to $41.5M while the previous year’s Chicken Littlelaunched with $40M. The two went on to gross $198M and $135.4M, respectively,from the North American market. Co-written by and starring Jerry Seinfeld, BeeMovie enjoyed virtually no competition in the current marketplace for familyaudiences. Critics were not too kind, but ticket buyers showed interest on theopening weekend. For 2007, the toon posted the fourth biggest debut for ananimated film after Shrek the Third($121.6M), TheSimpsons Movie ($74M) and Ratatouille($47M).Suffering the largest sophomore drop in franchise history, Saw IV tumbled 65%from its top spot bow and grossed an estimated $11M.

BuenaVista’s The Game Planfollowed in sixth with an estimated $3.9M, off only 37%, for a cume to date of$82M.Neglected and landing in seventh place was the newJohn Cusackdrama MartianChild which opened with an estimated $3.7M.

Leading the way is the horror film 30 Days of Night followed by the sports comedy The Comebacks which both will be targeting the teens and young adults that Hollywood has been ignoring in recent weeks. Mature adults who already have a wide selection of serious dramas to choose from will be served up three more – Reese Witherspoon‘s Rendition, Ben Affleck‘s Gone Baby Gone, and Halle Berry‘s Things We Lost in the Fire. With far too many films aiming for the same finite audience segment, some are sure to eat into the potential of others.Sony will monopolize the horror crowd looking for a scare before Halloween with its gorefest 30 Days of Night which tells of vampires that attack a small town in northern Alaska during its annual sunless period. The R-rated film prominently informs moviegoers in its marketing that it is based on a graphic novel hoping to tap into a little bit of the excitement generated by 300 last spring. The first eight months of this year were brutal to R-rated horror films with none reaching number one and high-profile franchise flicks like Hostel II, 28 Weeks Later, and The Hills Have Eyes 2 all failing to reach $10M on opening weekend. But the Halloween remake over Labor Day weekend changed all that and was followed three weeks later by another top spot debut from horror-action hybrid Resident Evil: Extinction. But those have died out so 30 Days stands as the only creepfest at a time when scary movies are in demand. Attacking 2,700 theaters, 30 Days of Night should easily top the charts and could bite into around $19M over the weekend.30 Days of NightFox spoofs the world of sports films with its new comedy The Comebacks which will target adolescents either too young for 30 Days or uninterested in scary movies. With so many mature stories hogging up screens, the market can certainly use a dose of immature humor right about now. The Comebacks is the first viable PG-13 comedy aimed at teens since fellow sports comedy Balls of Fury launched at the end of August. After a mid-week debut, that pic bowed to $11.4M over three days and Comebacks will play to many of the same folks. And with seventeen R-rated films opening wide over the last eight weeks, there has been little to celebrate for the under-17 crowd. Sure The Comebacks looks dumb, but dumb can sell. Add in a trim running time of under 90 minutes and commercial prospects are not bad. This is disposable entertainment for 14-year-olds. It will draw attention upfront, and be forgotten two weeks from now. Thanks to a lack of direct competition, The Comebacks could debut with about $11M from 2,800 sites.The ComebacksLeading the charge for the 30-plus crowd this weekend is Reese Witherspoon who headlines the political thriller Rendition from New Line. The R-rated drama finds the Oscar winner playing a woman whose Egyptian-born husband is captured by the CIA after being suspected of being a terrorist. Jake Gyllenhaal and Meryl Streep add to the cast. Rendition follows The Kingdom and In the Valley of Elah as military-themed films this fall with connections to the Middle East. Audiences will want only so much of this content. Witherspoon will have her starpower put to the test since she is the only major commercial star here and she is outside of her safety zone of romantic comedies. The film will play to mature adults and will have to compete not only with this weekend’s other new dramas, but also with an assortment of holdovers already playing to the same audience. Reviews have been mixed which will also make things difficult. Debuting in roughly 2,200 locations, Rendition may capture about $9M over the Friday-to-Sunday period.Reese Witherspoon and Peter Sarsgaard in RenditionBen Affleck makes his directorial debut with the crime thriller Gone Baby Gone which stars his brother Casey in the lead role. The Miramax release also stars Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, and Michelle Monaghan and carries a R rating. Reviews have been good which will come as a shocker to those that look at this movie as nothing more than Daredevil getting to hop into the director’s chair. Reese, Joaquin, George, Cate, and Halle will all be cutting into the adult pie which can only expand by a certain amount. The marketing push has been highlighting the film as being from the author of Mystic River in hopes of finding those who loved that other Boston-set fall crime drama. An invite to the top five may not arrive for Ben. Opening in approximately 1,500 theaters, Gone Baby Gone could collect about $6M this weekend.Freeman, Affleck and Monaghan in Gone Baby GoneYet another new option for adults looking for serious fare is the Halle Berry–Benicio Del Toro starrer Things We Lost in the Fire. The Paramount release about a widow who seeks comfort from her dead husband’s drug-addicted friend will play to a mature audience and skew more female. The R-rated film has generated some good early reviews and both leads have Oscars on their shelves, but it will not be enough to compete with the other films targeting the same crowd. Berry showed in April that she can only open a picture so much when her thriller Perfect Stranger bowed to a $4,211 average even though A-lister Bruce Willis co-starred. With a not-so-wide release in about 1,000 theaters this weekend, Things We Lost in the Fire might debut with around $3M.Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro in Things We Lost in the FireFreestyle Releasing has booked the few remaining empty screens out there for its teen thriller Sarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour. As one of the only PG-rated suspense pics ever made, the film will try to attract younger teenagers not interested in sports-themed comedies. With only 1,100 theaters, a quiet marketing campaign, no stars, and zero buzz, a weak debut of about $1M could result.Sarah Landon and the Paranormal HourAfter a potent number one debut, Tyler Perry‘s hit comedy Why Did I Get Married? should suffer a big fall in its second weekend if history is any indicator. Sophomore drops for the filmmaker’s previous offerings include 50% for Diary of a Mad Black Woman, 58% for Madea’s Family Reunion, and 57% for Daddy’s Little Girls. Lionsgate should see a 50% fall to about $10M this weekend giving the ensemble relationship tale $37M in ten days.Disney’s The Game Plan once again has no new competition for the kiddie audience. Why studios have programmed so many serious adult dramas into this month and no other good family films is anyone’s guess. A 35% dip would leave The Rock with $7M and an impressive cume of $68M after 24 days.Both Sony’s We Own the Night and the Warner Bros. thriller Michael Clayton will have to fight extra hard in order to compete with the new releases gunning for their customers. Night looks to slide more and fall by 45% while the strongly reviewed Clayton could ease by 40% with both films grossing roughly $6M over the weekend. That would lead to ten-day totals of $20M and $21M, respectively.LAST YEAR: Just two months after the release of the similarly-themed magician pic The Illusionist, Buena Vista still managed to score a number one bow for The Prestige which opened with $14.8M on its way to $53.1M. Martin Scorsese‘s The Departed enjoyed a strong hold and ranked second with $13.5M in its third frame. Debuting in third was Clint Eastwood‘s war saga Flags of Our Fathers with $10.2M leading to a disappointing $33.6M final for Paramount. Sony’s animated hit Open Season ranked fourth with $8.2M. Rounding out the top five was rival family film Flicka with $7.7M for Fox on its way to only $21M. Also premiering in the top ten was Sony’s Marie Antoinette with $5.4M which led to a final tally of just $16M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Carpet, Awards, ABC, Movies, Academy, rotten, Poppins, YouTube, MSNBC","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-30-Days-of-Night-Gets-Halloween-Started-Early"},{"id":"47509150778393","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Vampire Flick Scares Up #1 Debut","content":"\n\n                                            Weekend Box Office\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Box Office Guru Wrapup: Vampire Flick Scares Up #1 Debut\n                        30 Days of Night drains the competition.\n                        by Gitesh Pandya | October 21, 2007                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                Bloodthirty vampires flew high, depressing dramas sank, and many holdovers\nheld up well at the North American box office. The new horror flick \n30 Days of Night\neasily ruled the charts while a handful of adult dramas were met with opening\nweekend sales that ranged from mild to embarrassing. Oscar-winning actresses\nReese\nWitherspoon and\nHalle Berry\nboth failed miserably with their new serious stories which were both shunned by\nticket buyers. With so many fall offerings eating into each others’ business,\nthe overall marketplace remained sluggish as for the fifth consecutive weekend\nthe top ten slumped below year-ago levels.\nSony commanded the top spot with its R-rated gorefest \n30 Days of Night\nwhich opened with an estimated $16M over the Friday-to-Sunday period. Attacking\n2,855 theaters, the vampires-in-Alaska pic averaged a solid $5,604 and tapped\ninto a pre-Halloween box office that offered no major scary movies. The lack of\ncompetition helped the $30M\nJosh Hartnett\nstarrer which brought out older teens, young adults, and genre fans. Days\nwas based on a popular graphic novel and earned mixed reviews which is above\naverage by horror picture standards.\n\n\n\nTyler Perry\nfollowed up his muscular top spot debut for his latest comedy \nWhy\nDid I Get Married? with a strong second weekend hold dropping only\n43% to an estimated $12.1M. After just ten days in theaters, the Lionsgate\nrelease has already collected a sturdy $38.9M which is just ahead of the $38.1M\nthat Perry’s first film \nDiary of a\nMad Black Woman took in during its first ten days in 2005. Married\nsuffered a smaller drop than his other films witnessed indicating that the\nfilmmaker’s latest entry could be reaching beyond its core African American\naudience. Diary fell 50% in its sophomore session while \n\nMadea’s Family Reunion and \nDaddy’s Little\nGirls tumbled by about 57% each. Married looks on course to reach\na remarkable $65-70M which would be a new career high for Perry\n\n\n\nPosting the smallest decline in the top ten once again was\nThe Rock‘s hit family\ncomedy The Game\nPlan which ranked third in its fourth weekend with an estimated\n$8.1M. That represented a slim drop of only 26% and boosted Disney’s cume to\n$69.2M. The durable sensation ranks as the actor’s second biggest hit in a lead\nrole after The Scorpion King which took in $90.5M in 2002.\nGame Plan should\neasily surpass that mark and has not yet seen a drop of more than 35%.\n\n\nAlso holding up very well was\nGeorge Clooney‘s legal thriller\nMichael Clayton\nwhich remained in fourth place with an estimated $7.1M. The Warner Bros. title\ndropped by only 32% and boosted its total gross to $22M matching its production\nbudget. The marketplace was crowded with adult dramas targeting Clayton‘s\naudience so the strong hold was an impressive performance. Powerful reviews and\ngood word-of-mouth contributed to the success. A final tally of $40-50M may\nresult.\n\n\n\nTwo new films fought fiercely over the number five spot. Miramax estimated that\nits kidnapping thriller \nGone Baby Gone would collect $6M over the weekend from\n1,713 theaters for a mild $3,503 average. The directorial debut of\nBen Affleck\nstars his brother\n\nCasey Affleck along with\nMorgan Freeman and\nEd Harris and was\ngreeted with stellar reviews from film critics. Produced for $19M, Gone faced\ntough competition from other adult dramas but could have legs in the weeks\nahead.\n\n\n\nAiming for teens and young adults with a dose of immature spoof comedy was \nThe\nComebacks which grossed an estimated $5.9M for Fox. The PG-13 sports film\nenjoyed a much wider release in 2,812 venues and generated a dull $2,080\naverage. The debut was nowhere near the numbers that the studio has seen in the\nrecent past with its other spoof comedies. Both \nEpic Movie from earlier this\nyear and Date Movie from 2006 debuted to about $19M. Comebacks will be lucky to\nreach that amount overall.\n\n\n\nDespite the weekend estimates reported by Miramax and Fox, three studios\nestimated that Comebacks edged out Gone Baby Gone by a slim margin over the\nweekend. Miramax’s estimate factored in a 26% Saturday-to-Sunday decline while\nFox’s figure includes a more reasonable 38% drop. All other films in the top ten\nprojected Sunday declines of 34% to 51%. Final box office grosses to be reported\non Monday will tell which film truly earns the fifth-place spot. The position is\nvaluable to studios for the publicity since many news outlets only report on the\ntop five films each weekend and ignore anything below them.\n\n\n\nFalling hardest among holdover titles was the\nJoaquin\nPhoenix/Mark\nWahlberg\ncrime thriller \nWe Own the Night\nwhich dropped by 49% to an estimated $5.5M in its second weekend. The Sony\nrelease has banked $19.8M in ten days and looks headed for a mediocre finish of\n$30-33M.\n\n\n\nGenerating the hottest average in the top ten was the latest re-release of Tim\nBurton’s creepy animated hit \nThe Nightmare Before Christmas which debuted to an\nestimated $5.1M from only 564 theaters for a potent $9,122 average. The special\n3D version was given a wider launch by Disney compared to this weekend a year\nago when it opened in 168 theaters for a $3.3M weekend and sizzling $19,506\naverage. That re-release bagged $8.7M while its original 1993 run brought in\n$50M. With no other good options for parents other than the studio’s own The\nGame Plan, Nightmare proved to be an exciting pre-Halloween option for families.\nThe PG-rated film will only play for a limited three-week engagement and goes\nback into the Mouse House’s vault soon after the pumpkin holiday.\n\n\n\nMoviegoers ignored the terrorism drama \nRendition despite its acclaimed cast\nallowing it to barely debut in the top ten. The New Line release opened to an\nestimated $4.2M from 2,250 locations for a horrible $1,856 average. It was Reese\nWitherspoon’s first film since winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for\n2005’s Walk the Line, but fans were not biting. Jake Gyllenhaal,\nMeryl Streep,\nand Alan Arkin also starred in the R-rated story of a woman in search of her\nEgyptian-born husband who is captured by the CIA after being suspected of being\na terrorist. Rendition was the third film in recent weeks dealing with Middle\nEast issues and entered a marketplace flooded with serious adult dramas. Plus\nlukewarm reviews helped to make this a non-priority among ticket buyers this\nweekend.\n\n\n\nRounding out the top ten was the\nBen Stiller comedy\nThe\nHeartbreak Kid with an\nestimated $3.9M, off 46%, for a $32.1M cume for Paramount.\n\n\n\nHalle Berry joined fellow Oscar-winning actress Reese in striking out with\naudiences with her new adult drama. The former Storm headlined the Paramount\nrelease \nThings We Lost in the Fire with\nBenicio Del Toro and attracted a measly\n$1.6M in business on opening weekend, according to estimates. Debuting in 1,142\nlocations, the R-rated film about a woman who befriends her dead husband’s\nheroin-addicted pal averaged a pathetic $1,405. Reviews were generally favorable\nand studio research indicated that two-thirds of the audience consisted of women\nover 30. Fire cost a relatively low $16M to produce, but has a long road ahead\nof it in order to reach profitability.\n\n\n\nTwo additional films risked going nationwide and met with embarrassing results.\nThe teen thriller \nSarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour bowed to an estimated\n$560,000 from 1,115 theaters for a disastrous $502 average for Freestyle\nReleasing. Meanwhile, Rocky Mountain Pictures unleashed its animated pic \nThe Ten\nCommandments in 830 sites and was met with only $480,000, according to\nestimates, for a horrible $578 average. Both films should find their primary\naudiences on DVD.\nFocus saw a soft bow for its downbeat drama \nReservation Road which debuted in\njust fourteen theaters for a weak estimate of $36,821 for a poor average of\n$2,630. The arthouse crowd was just not in the mood for this depressing drama\nabout the death of a young boy which starred Joaquin Phoenix,\nMark Ruffalo,\nJennifer Connelly, and\nMira Sorvino. Also hurting\nRoad‘s performance were\nreviews that were far from glowing.\n\n\n\nWith all the new content in the multiplexes, five films were tossed out of the\ntop ten over the weekend. The costume drama sequel \nElizabeth: The Golden Age\ndropped 49% in its sophomore session to an estimated $3.1M giving Universal a\nweak $11.2M in ten days. Look for the\nCate Blanchett pic to end its domestic run\nwith a dismal $16-18M. Overseas prospects do look brighter though.\n\n\n\nSony’s durable musical extravaganza  \nAcross the\nUniverse dipped by 29% to an\nestimated $2.7M for a solid $16.8M total from less than 1,000 theaters. A\n$25-30M final could result. The Saudi Arabia-set political thriller \nThe Kingdom fell by 48% in its fourth outing to an estimated $2.4M. Universal has taken in\n$44M thus far and should end up with just under $50M which means that the $70M\nproduction will need to still work hard overseas and on video in order to break\neven.\n\n\n\nThe Milla Jovovich threequel\n\nResident Evil: Extinction tumbled 60% to an\nestimated $1.1M and raised its sum to a cool $50M. Fox’s fantasy adventure \nThe\nSeeker: The Dark is Rising saw its weekend gross nosedive by an alarming 81% to\nan estimated $425,000 lifting the dull total to $8.2M with little left to go.\n\n\n\nThe top ten films grossed an estimated $73.9M which was down 10% from last year\nwhen The Prestige debuted in first place with $14.8M; but up 13% from 2005 when\nDoom opened in the top spot with $15.5M.\n","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"psychological, king, TV, Pacific","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Vampire-Flick-Scares-Up-1-Debut"},{"id":"47509149083662","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Golden Compass Sets Course For #1 Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Golden Compass Sets Course For #1 DebutAtonement, Juno open in limited release.by Gitesh Pandya | December 6, 2007 |  CommentsNew Line hopes to breathe some life into the North American box office with the launch of its pricey adventure film The Golden Compass which stands as the frame’s only new wide release. Directed by Chris Weitz (About a Boy), the PG-13 film aims to capture a large crowd including the family audience and fans of sci-fi and fantasy. Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, who proved in the summer flop The Invasion that their names only carry so much commercial weight, reunite to star in the effects-heavy film.Working in its favor is the fact that all other studios have avoided programming their major offerings onto this weekend’s schedule. In fact it is quite rare to see two consecutive frames with only one national opener each. Media attention is concentrated on it this week and with multiplexes dumping their aging November flops, Compass will secure extra screens. The studio’s marketing push has been powerful and awareness is high which makes sense as New Line is hoping for a new fantasy franchise that can keep the cash rolling in for years to come. Teens and young adults who frequent the multiplexes the most should come out in solid numbers since they’ve seen every other worthy film already. Older adults will be a little harder to reach since holiday shopping is a major distraction on weekends right now plus reviews for Compass have not exactly been stellar.Although the property will target many of the same folks who have dropped billions on fantasy smashes like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and The Chronicles of Narnia, the source material is not as popular plus there is already backlash from some in the religious community for the anti-Christian material in the Philip Pullman books. Reaching the $65.6M opening of Narnia from this very weekend two years ago will be impossible. Instead, a debut closer to the $27.5M of Beowulf last month could be in order since there may be much overlap. Compass has more appeal for younger kids and females so a bigger bow should result. Opening in over 3,000 theaters, The Golden Compass might premiere to the tune of $33M this weekend.Nicole Kidman in The Golden CompassWith most of the big boys taking the weekend off from releasing films wide, indie distribs will once again seize the opportunity to platform their end-of-year pics and begin limited runs for possible kudos contenders. By law, you can’t have an awards season without at least one costume drama so Focus Features joins forces with Keira Knightley with Atonement which bows on Friday in 26 sites. The R-rated period piece also stars James McAvoy and Vanessa Redgrave and has already grossed $31M overseas with over two-thirds of that total coming from the U.K. since its launch there in early September.James McAvoy and Keira Knightley in AtonementFox Searchlight counters in seven theaters with its teen pregnancy comedy Juno starring Michael Cera, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner, and Ellen Page in the title role. The PG-13 coming-of-age pic opened on Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles and is director Jason Reitman‘s follow-up to Thank You For Smoking which grossed $24.8M for Fox Searchlight in the spring of 2006. Reviews have been strong across the board for both Juno and Atonement.Ellen Page and Olivia Thirlby in JunoAfter back to back stints of wearing the box office crown, the princess comedy Enchanted is now preparing to take a step back this weekend thanks to the arrival of Queen Kidman. The Disney hit will see some formidable competition for kids, but the overall drop should not be too large. A 35% slide to around $10.5M could result. That would give Enchanted a charming $83M after 19 days of play.With girls lining up for Giselle and company, their brothers have been taking a historical adventure with the computer-animated action pic Beowulf which has been holding its own since its debut. Golden Compass will also be a threat since there is much audience overlap. But Beowulf‘s good legs suggest that a drop of 35% could be in order here as well. That would leave the Paramount project with about $5M pushing the cume up to $76M.Sony’s holiday reunion film This Christmas and Fox’s assassin thriller Hitman both witnessed larger sophomore declines so a fall of 40% each should occur this weekend. Christmas would take in just under $5M for a $42M total while Hitman should bank $3.5M for a $36M sum.LAST YEAR: Mel Gibson scored his second straight number one opening for a historical foreign language film he directed with Apocalypto which debuted on top with $15M. The Buena Vista release went on to capture a solid $50.9M. Three-time champ Happy Feet was bumped down to second with $12.9M in its fourth frame. Sony’s romantic comedy The Holiday bowed in third with $12.8M for Sony. The Cameron Diaz–Kate Winslet pic went on to gross $63.2M domestically and a stunning $200M worldwide.

Warner Bros. launched its action thriller Blood Diamond in fifth with a mediocre $8.6M on its way to $57.4M from North America and $171M globally.

But the new warrior Beowulf is no B movie but an A-list production from an Oscar-winning director offering action audiences something new. Also opening this weekend but likely to see more modest grosses are the family pic Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium and the romantic drama Love in the Time of Cholera. Without a compelling selection of great films, the marketplace should once again fall well below year-ago levels.Paramount looks to capture the box office crown without the help of DreamWorks this time with Beowulf, a computer-animated action adventure based on the ancient epic poem. The PG-13 film comes from Robert Zemeckis who expands upon the motion capture technology he used in 2004’s The Polar Express. This time around his film is aimed at somewhat older moviegoers as young children will be too frightened by the violence, gore, and yes, nudity. Beowulf aims to pry 14-year-old boys away from their videogame systems and into the multiplexes with a new type of action film that is presented in 3D in selected theaters. Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, and Angelina Jolie lend their voices and digital likenesses.The marketing has been terrific on the part of the studio. The core audience of young males is excited and ready to buy tickets and the film might even pull in part of the literary crowd curious to see how this classic tale is adapted to the big screen. The marketplace needs something like this now with hits like American Gangster skewing more adult and kidpics like Bee Movie not offering enough violence. If last December’s Eragon could open to $23.2M, then surely Beowulf can target the same crowd and go higher. Launching in over 2,800 theaters, Beowulf could conquer the box office this weekend with about $32M.The digitally-altered likeness of Ray Winstone in BeowulfDustin Hoffman stars as the eccentric owner of a magical toy store in Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium, a new entry for family audiences from Fox. The G-rated film co-stars Natalie Portman and Jason Bateman. With Bee Movie and Fred Claus already out there doing solid business, and likely to collect a combined $30M this weekend, competition for Emporium will be intense. Bad reviews will make parents hesitate, but if kids respond to the TV commercials, then they will find a way to force their parents to take them. Opening wide in around 3,200 locations, Mr. Magorium could bow to about $11M this weekend and try to remain a relevant choice over the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday session.Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman in Mr. Magorium’s Wonder EmporiumTo counter his current role as a brutal killer in No Country for Old Men, Javier Bardem stars in the romantic drama Love in the Time of Cholera. The R-rated tale from New Line is getting a moderately wide release and will play to an older adult audience with a female skew. The Oscar buzz Bardem has been receiving for Country could rub off on Cholera helping its case. And Latino audiences are being counted on to show up as are fans of Oprah who has endorsed the book that the film is based on. But overall, the Columbia-set film has not generated enough excitement to deliver a solid debut. Plus poor reviews will turn away much of the target audience. A slot on the lower end of the top ten could await. Opening in about 800 theaters, Love in the Time of Cholera might gross around $3M over the weekend.Love in the Time of CholeraBee Movie should fall from its spot at the top of the box office and slide by about 30% since there is not too much new competition for young kids. A weekend tally of $18M could result giving Paramount $97M to date. Universal’s American Gangster should drop by 40% to about $14.5M giving the crime saga a total of $102M. The holiday comedy Fred Claus could dip by 35% in its second weekend. That would leave the Warner Bros. release with a weekend take of $12M and a ten-day cume of $35.5M.LAST YEAR: In a major pre-holiday showdown, the penguin toon Happy Feet edged out the new James Bond film Casino Royale for the number one spot with a strong opening of $41.5M. The Warner Bros. family hit went on to collect $198M domestically and a stellar $384M worldwide. Sony’s relaunched spy series still posted a muscular debut grossing $40.8M over the weekend on its way to $167M domestically and a sensational $595M globally making the Daniel Craig-starrer the top-grossing 007 flick ever. After two weeks on top, Fox’s Borat slipped to third with $14.6M. Rounding out the top five were Disney’s The Santa Clause 3 with $8.3M and the Sony release Stranger Than Fiction with $6.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Disney, political","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Beowulf-Set-To-Conquer-Multiplexes"},{"id":"47509149098006","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Bees and Gangsters Slug It Out For #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Bees and Gangsters Slug It Out For #1 SpotThis weekend should see a healthy box office.by Gitesh Pandya | November 1, 2007 |  CommentsFollowing a sluggish fall season, November kicks off with a bang this weekend with two high profile films both reaching for the number one spot while appealing to vastly different audiences. Paramount and DreamWorks target kids with the animated comedy Bee Movie from Jerry Seinfeld while Universal goes after adult audiences with its crime drama American Gangster which pits Denzel Washington against Russell Crowe. With little overlap in business, the overall North American box office should surge and finally beat out year-ago levels leading to a solid kickoff for the holiday movie season.A decade after conquering the television world, Jerry Seinfeld aims to take over the land of film with Bee Movie. The PG-rated toon tells the story of a bee that must try to save his world from those nasty humans that take their honey. Also lending vocal talents are Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Oprah Winfrey, and Chris Rock who snagged the coveted ‘and’ credit for what amounts to about 60 seconds of dialogue. Timing for the Paramount/DreamWorks release is as good as it gets. Not only is early November a hot time for kids movies to score at the box office but the marketplace has suffered a virtual drought when it comes to family-friendly entertainment this fall with The Game Plan being the only major contender. Parents are dying to take their kids to something else, anything else.Bee Movie falls into the lucrative category of digitally animated comedies about talking creatures featuring the voice of a popular comedian. Last November’s Happy Feet with Robin Williams opened to $41.5M, the previous year’s Chicken Little bowed to $40M, and 2004’s Shark Tale debuted with $47.6M. Bee has the slick animation and funny situations that kids like but also features humor that adults will enjoy too so it will play to a broad audience. And the millions of Seinfeld fans that have had nothing but DVD box sets every Thanksgiving will finally have some new material they can check out from their favorite comic. Critics have not been very kind but that should not affect the grosses that much. The studio’s marketing blitz will be enough to make children demand a trip to the local megaplex. With a highly commercial product, no competition for the family audience, and an ultrawide launch in over 3,500 theaters, Bee Movie could win the box office battle this weekend and gross about $42M.Jerry Seinfeld’s Bee MovieBoasting a much higher bodycount this weekend is Ridley Scott‘s American Gangster starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe which will shoot up some solid numbers from adult audiences. The R-rated drama tells the true story of Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas who built up a mammoth empire selling heroin. Crowe plays the detective out to shut him down. Starpower from the three names, all of whom have won or been nominated for Oscars multiple times, will be the driving force at the turnstiles. Universal’s $90M+ production also has garnered strong reviews which will help the cause and has been backed by an effective marketing push. The running time of nearly two hours and forty minutes will cut back on the amount of times each auditorium can play the film. Even multiplexes that double-screen the picture will probably run out of seats on Friday and Saturday nights.Gangster should play out like a Denzel movie more than anything else since his box office track record is the strongest and has more consistency than those of Scott and Crowe. Having scored ten career number one openings to date, Washington has seen his top bow come from last year’s Inside Man which debuted to $29M and a $10,275 average. Last fall’s organized crime hit The Departed opened to $26.9M and a $8,912 average and makes for a good comparison given its genre, starpower, acclaim, rating, and length. Gangster will attract a larger African American audience than Scorsese‘s award winner did so an opening north of $30M seems likely. Appeal to men and women will be equally strong. Many adult dramas have struggled at the box office this fall but American Gangster has the firepower to go out there and pull in paying audiences. Plus the weekend’s other major offerings will not eat into its customer base by too much. Heading into 3,054 theaters, American Gangster might debut with around $34M this weekend.Washington and Crowe in American GangsterAfter starring in the year’s second highest grossing horror film 1408, John Cusack hits the big screen again in the family drama Martian Child. The PG-rated film finds the actor playing a writer whose adopted son claims to be from Mars. Parents looking for a movie that they can see with their kids this weekend will be lining up for Jerry and his insect pals so Child will face an uphill battle. New Line hopes that there will be room in the marketplace for a live-action pic for kids but even The Game Plan in its sixth session will be a force to be reckoned with. Invading over 2,000 theaters, Martian Child might take in roughly $6M.John Cusack in The Martian ChildFollowing its strong top spot launch, the horror flick Saw IV is sure to fall hard on the second weekend. Sophomore drops amounted to 47% for Saw II and 56% for Saw III and the decline should get even larger for the fourth installment. A 60% plunge would give Lionsgate about $13M for the frame and a ten-day cume of $51M.Look for a better hold from Steve Carell‘s dramedy Dan in Real Life. The Buena Vista title enjoyed a solid average and has generated good word-of-mouth. The weekend’s new releases may not provide too much competition so a decline of 35% could result. That would put Dan at around $7.5M for a total of $22M after ten days.LAST YEAR: Crashing into multiplexes on a tidal wave of buzz was the raunchy comedy Borat which only debuted in 837 theaters but scored a potent top spot bow of $26.5M for a sizzling average of $31,607. The Fox blockbuster was the only film in 2006 to hit number one while playing in less than 2,000 venues. Final grosses reached $128.5M domestically and over $260M worldwide. Two new kidpics split the family audience and followed in second and third. Disney’s Tim Allen sequel The Santa Clause 3 bowed to $19.5M on its way to $84.5M while Paramount’s animated comedy Flushed Away debuted close behind with $18.8M before finishing with $64.5M. Falling to fourth was Saw III with $14.8M for Lionsgate while the Warner Bros. crime thriller The Departed rounded out the top five with $7.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com,","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"blockbusters, Winter","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Bees-and-Gangsters-Slug-It-Out-For-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509149087760","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Enchanted Conjures Up $50M Thanksgiving Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Enchanted Conjures Up $50M Thanksgiving DebutThe latest Disney movie was no holiday turkey.by Gitesh Pandya | November 25, 2007 |  CommentsThe box office bounced back over the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend asmoviegoers spread their dollars across a wide variety of films whichcollectively helped to bring the marketplace back to life after a mostlyuneventful fall season. Disney led the way with its new family pic Enchanted,which ruled the multiplexes, but a surprisingly potent opening for the holidaycomedy This Christmas contributed to the weekend’s success too. Other newreleases were sprinkled across the top ten which virtually matched theThanksgiving numbers posted over each of the last two years. An unprecedentedeleven films each grossed $8M or more over the frame as every audience segmentfound something to see over the long holiday weekend.For the first time in eight years, Disney opened a new release at number oneover the turkey frame. The studio’s princess tale Enchantedpowered past allcompetitors to bow on top with an estimated $35.3M over the Friday-to-Sundayperiod and an incredible $50M across the five-day holiday span which began onWednesday. That led to a muscular $9,472 average from an ultrawide 3,730 sitesover three days. The PG-rated story of an animated princess who encounters thelive-action world posted the second biggest five-day opening ever over theThanksgiving session.The only hit to debut better was 1999’s Toy Story 2 from Disney and Pixar with$80.1M which was also the studio’s last new pic to bow at number one over thisframe. From 1994 to 1999, the Mouse House consistently debuted a new family filmeach year at number one over this lucrative holiday frame. Enchanted should haveno problem finding its way into the century club.Beating expectations to open in the number two spot was the family reunion filmThis Christmas which debuted to an estimated $18.6M over three days and astunning $27.1M over the five-day period. Sony’s inexpensive $13M productionaveraged a potent $10,011 over three days from only 1,858 theaters for the bestaverage among wide releases. The feel-good holiday pic brought in two-thirds ofits business from African-American moviegoers proving once again how powerfulthat audience is at the box office. Look for This Christmas to finish up as avery profitable venture.Last week’s top warrior Beowulfdropped 41% to an estimated $16.2M and landed inthird place. With $56.4M in its treasure chest after ten days, the$150M-budgeted Paramount release should conclude its domestic run with about$80-90M.Competing actioner Hitmandebuted in fourth place with an estimated $13M overthree days from 2,458 locations. Averaging a decent $5,303 per venue, theR-rated film about a super-assassin was adapted from a popular video game. Overfive days, Hitman shot up $21M for Fox which was targeting many of the sameyoung males that were going to see Beowulf.The animated hit BeeMovie followed in fifth with an estimated $12M, off just14%, for a $112.1M sum to date for Paramount. Warner Bros. was close behind withrival family offering Fred Clauswhich dipped 10% to an estimated $10.7M pushingthe total to $53.1M.Studio stablemate August Rush opened in seventh place with an estimated $9.4Mover three days and $13.3M across five days. The family drama about a youngmusical genius averaged a moderate $4,082 over the Friday-to-Sunday period.American Gangster remained strong in its fourth frame grossing an estimated$9.2M, down 29%, upping its cume for Universal to $115.8M.Two more new wide releases rounded out the top ten. The Mist, a terror talebased on a Stephen King story, debuted in ninth place with an estimated $9.1Mwith a five-day take of $13M. Attacking 2,423 theaters, the R-rated filmaveraged a mild $3,740 over three days. Horror films typically do not see hugenumbers over Thanksgiving weekend as most moviegoers are in the mood for morecheery and upbeat films. Miramax expanded its Coen brothers hit No Country forOld Men into nationwide release and captured an estimated $8.1M over three days.The crime thriller averaged a superb $9,433 and lifted its total to $16.6M.Opening to solid results from the arthouses was theBob Dylan picI’m Not There which grossed an estimated $757,000 from just 130 venues over the three-dayperiod. The Weinstein Co. release averaged a respectable $5,823 per site andcollected $1M over the long holiday session.The top ten films grossed $141.8M over the weekend which was up less than 1%from last year when Happy Feet remained at number one with $37M; but off 1% from2005 when Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire stayed on top with $54.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Wars, reboot, Trivia, Rey, Winners, video, science, what, Month, Star, Music, golden, supernatural, Nickelodeon, Lucasfilm","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Enchanted-Conjures-Up-50M-Thanksgiving-Debut"},{"id":"47509150782492","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Wide Open Race For #1 Spot This Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Wide Open Race For #1 Spot This WeekendFive films compete for box office crown.by Gitesh Pandya | October 11, 2007 |  CommentsFive new films push their way into nationwide release on Friday hoping to challenge two-time champ The Rock making for what should be a free-for-all at the North American box office with many different studios having a realistic shot at claiming the number one spot. Among the top contenders are Sony’s crime thriller We Own the Night, the Lionsgate comedy Why Did I Get Married?, and the George Clooney vehicle Michael Clayton which expands nationally after its scorching debut in limited release. Adding to the mix are the costume drama Elizabeth: The Golden Age and the baseball tale The Final Season. The box office race should be a tight one with as many as four films likely to reach the low double digit millions.Oscar nominated actors Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix face off as brothers on different sides of the law in the new action thriller We Own the Night. The R-rated pic co-stars Robert Duvall and Eva Mendes and will target an adult audience with a slightly male skew. The former Marky Mark proved his box office pull last spring as the only major star in Shooter which bowed to $14.5M and a $5,176 average by targeting the same audience. Things will be more difficult this time because of the intense competition for mature audiences especially from Michael Clayton. But Night‘s biggest advantage over Michael is that it has two commercial stars instead of just one. The combo should lead to a slim edge at the cash registers.Despite its awkward title, Night has been pushing itself as an action-packed thriller with faces people love to watch. Reviews have been mixed and with such a crowded field, it will be hard to stand out as a must-see option. Starpower should be the main factor here and showdowns between two solid actors are usually popular with ticket buyers. Opening in over 2,000 theaters, We Own the Night could debut to about $12M.Phoenix and Wahlberg in We Own the NightTaking on those boys with some machismo of his own, George Clooney heads into wide release with his legal drama Michael Clayton which Warner Bros. has drummed up plenty of awards buzz for. The R-rated pic bowed to a sizzling $47,994 average last weekend from its platform bow in the Clooney-friendly towns of New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto. This weekend, the thriller will face the real test when it enters every major market across the 50 states. Thanks to his political outspokenness, the Academy Award winning actor has become a polarizing figure. He could easily win an election to become mayor of Hollywood, but in other parts of the country people would gladly pay theaters to not play his movies.Clayton will test his drawing power since the film has no other box office anchors in it. Co-stars Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, and Sydney Pollack are well-respected, but they don’t sell tickets. There is plenty of direct competition which is why the film got a head start a week early. Buzz from its red hot platform bow has spread helping to build interest. The crowd will consist of the same people that opened Syriana to $11.7M, The Black Dahlia to $10M, and Zodiac to $13.4M. Night will take away some males and Elizabeth will steal some females so a huge gross will be hard to find. But over the long-term the film could have legs. Expanding into 2,511 locations, Michael Clayton stands as the widest of the new offerings and may capture around $11M over the Friday-to-Sunday period.Clooney as ClaytonTyler Perry‘s latest relationship comedy Why Did I Get Married? finds trouble brewing when four married couples come together for an annual winter getaway. The writer/director’s films have always tapped into his loyal fan base with African American women at the core. His 2005 smash Diary of a Mad Black Woman surprised the industry with its first-place debut with $21.9M and a $14,771 average and was followed a year later by Madea’s Family Reunion which grew bigger with a $30M launch. Perry’s last pic Daddy’s Little Girls, also a February release, saw more modest numbers with a $11.2M opening as the filmmaker did not star in the pic.Married does not have the promotional value of Black History Month or the help of Presidents Day which Girls had early this year. However, Perry’s new film will not face any direct competitors for its target audience. Girls had to face the second weekend of Eddie Murphy‘s hit comedy Norbit which offered some audience overlap. Plus Married boasts more starpower with Perry back on screen and an added boost will come from Janet Jackson who is always a strong draw at the box office with the target audience every time she makes a rare appearance in a movie. The PG-13 film from Lionsgate is unlike anything else in the marketplace right now and with few buzzworthy films aimed at black moviegoers in recent months, it should successfully connect. Debuting in 2,011 theaters, Why Did I Get Married? might open with roughly $12M this weekend.Tyler Perry’s Why Did I Get Married?Another female-driven film, but taking place centuries ago and across the pond, is the historical drama Elizabeth: The Golden Age which finds Cate Blanchett reprising the role of the British Queen which made her a star nine years ago. The PG-13 pic also finds Geoffrey Rush returning and adds Clive Owen to the mix telling the story of the later years of the monarch’s 16th century reign when threats from Spain and a possible love affair at home led to new challenges. Though at the core a costume drama like its predecessor, Universal’s marketing has played up the action and adventure elements in hopes of attracting men looking for warfare and battle scenes. That may backfire when word gets out that there is actually very little action on screen.The first Elizabeth opened in limited release in November 1998 and rolled through awards season that winter eventually reaching an impressive $30M while never playing in more than 600 theaters. It also bagged seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture. Now the studio is hoping that a built-in audience will want to take another trip to the past. Though the first was an acclaimed picture, no real demand ever surfaced for a sequel. So it will be tough for Golden Age at the box office especially with all the competition. Female-led dramas often struggle in the marketplace since it is often too hard for adult women to drag men with them to the multiplex for these stories. New films from Clooney and Wahlberg offer more cross-gender appeal. Ordering her troops into 2,000 theaters on Friday, Elizabeth: The Golden Age might take home about $8M over the three-day period.Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush in Elizabeth: The Golden AgeLikely to strike out at the box office this weekend is the high school baseball pic The Final Season which stars Sean Astin, Larry Miller, and Powers Boothe. The PG-rated film offers no starpower and has generated very little excitement for itself in the marketplace. Most sports fans interested in the national pastime will tune into the playoffs on their television sets this weekend. A quick trip to DVD is assured for this one which has no guarantee to clinch a spot in the top ten. Opening in about 1,000 theaters, a weekend take of just $2M could be in the works.The Final SeasonAmong holdovers, The Game Plan surprised the industry two weeks in a row by taking the number one spot. Given its strong legs and continued lack of competition for the family audience and younger teens, a third round on top is not totally out of the question. Should all the newbies eat into each other and all fail to reach the $12M mark, the Disney kidpic by default may stay put. A 25% decline would give The Game Plan a third weekend tally of $12.5M pushing the 17-day total to a solid $58M.Paramount and DreamWorks were caught by surprise by the lack of strength for the opening of the Ben Stiller comedy The Heartbreak Kid. With nothing to keep it afloat, a 45% decline might be in order especially since adults will be distracted by a wide assortment of other options. That would give the Farrelly brothers a sophomore session of about $7.5M and a cume of only $25.5M after ten days.LAST YEAR: Sony used the Friday the 13th before Halloween to launch the sequel to one of the most successful horror films in history and captured the number one spot. The Grudge 2 bowed on top with $20.8M accounting for more than half of its $39.1M final. Eventual Oscar champ The Departed slipped to second with $19M easing only 29% for Warner Bros. The Robin Williams political comedy Man of the Year debuted in third with $12.3M before finishing with a disappointing $37.3M for Universal. Rounding out the top five were the Sony toon Open Season with $11.1M and New Line’s fright franchise flick Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning with $7.5M for a steep 60% plunge. Opening with weak results in sixth was the action pic The Marine with $7.1M on its way to $18.8M for Fox. The religious-themed drama One Night with the King bowed to $4.1M with a good $4,518 average and finished with $13.4M for 8X.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Black, Horse, Awards, Red, Anna, color, america, Country, zombie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Wide-Open-Race-For-1-Spot-This-Weekend"},{"id":"47509150795810","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Jovovich vs. Alba in Multiplex Mayhem","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Jovovich vs. Alba in Multiplex MayhemResident Evil: Extinction takes on Good Luck Chuckby Gitesh Pandya | September 20, 2007 |  CommentsJodie Foster will find herself in the middle of a catfight over the number one spot this weekend. The star of current chart-topper The Brave One will face challenges from Milla Jovovich‘s new action sequel Resident Evil: Extinction, Jessica Alba‘s romantic comedy Good Luck Chuck, and the Amanda Bynes college laugher Sydney White. With adult-skewing dramas ruling the box office over the past couple of weeks, teens and young adults should be out in full force this weekend thanks to the selection of new options.Deadly viruses and killer zombies are back in Sony’s Extinction, the latest and final chapter in its video game-inspired action-horror franchise. The series has been a popular one with the first Resident Evil opening to $17.7M in March 2002 and its sequel Resident Evil: Apocalypse debuting to a stronger $23M in September 2004. Each averaged about $7,000 over the debut frame. The R-rated Extinction will play to the converted and is not likely to generate any new fans. In fact, some will drop out thinking a third helping is a bit too much. Still the built-in audience of young adults and gamers plus a solid marketing push guarantee a top spot launch. Attacking over 2,700 locations, Resident Evil: Extinction could capture roughly $20M over the three-day debut period.Milla Jovovich fights a zombie in Resident Evil: ExtinctionDane Cook plays a dude whose every ex-girlfriend ends up engaged to the next guy she dates in the romantic comedy Good Luck Chuck. Jessica Alba co-stars in the R-rated release from Lionsgate which will use starpower to attract an audience of older teens and young adults. Last October Cook teamed up with another Jessica, Simpson that time, in the PG-13 comedy Employee of the Month which bowed to $11.4M. The marketing on Chuck has been good and cross-gender appeal seems solid too, although the rating could cut into business from younger teens who will certainly want to see this picture. Falling into 2,612 theaters, Good Luck Chuck may gross about $12M this weekend.Jessica Alba and Dane Cook in Good Luck ChuckAmanda Bynes headlines the college comedy Sydney White playing a freshman caught between the popular sorority sisters and her nerdy pals. The PG-13 film will aim itself squarely at teens and college students and should skew a bit more female. Hollywood has had a tough time reaching young females recently with flops like Nancy Drew ($6.8M opening), Bratz ($4.2M), and Gracie ($1.4M) all stalling. Sydney will try to appeal to the same crowd that powered Bynes’ comedy She’s the Man to $10.7M in March 2006. However the marketing push is not as strong and the release will not be as wide so the three-day take will be softer. The marketplace’s current lack of offerings for this audience creates a great opportunity for a good marketable film to come in a loot some cash. But Sydney just doesn’t seem to have what it takes to score a big opening. Pledging in over 1,900 theaters, Sydney White could debut with around $6M.Amanda Bynes in Sydney WhiteLast weekend, David Cronenberg‘s latest crime thriller Eastern Promises enjoyed a limited release bow that was basically a carbon copy of his last film A History of Violence which opened to $515,992 from 14 theaters in September 2005 for a potent $36,857 average. Focus is now matching History‘s sophomore weekend expansion pattern by widening Promises to 1,404 locations nationwide. History in its second session expanded to 1,340 sites and grossed $8.1M for a solid $6,047 average. Reviews and buzz for Promises is just as good so a similar performance could be in the works. Ticket prices are slightly higher, but so are the number of films also targeting an adult audience. In fact, the top five this weekend should boast mostly R-rated fare. For this weekend, look for Eastern Promises to take in about $8M.Eastern PromisesIn the arthouse scene, which is quickly getting more crowded with each passing week, Brad Pitt rolls in as both actor and producer in the Old West drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Warner Bros. is unleashing the R-rated pic in only 15 theaters in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Austin hoping to generate a strong average and positive word of mouth. Pitt already scored the Best Actor trophy for his portrayal of the famous outlaw at the Venice International Film Festival and is making a bid for kudos attention over the months ahead. Reviews have been mostly positive and an expansion is planned for the coming weeks.The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert FordAfter a less-than-spectacular number one opening, Jodie Foster‘s revenge thriller The Brave One will try to fend off competition for its mature adult audience from the expansion of Eastern Promises. The frame’s three newbies should play to other audience segments. A 45% drop would give Warner Bros. about $7.5M for the weekend and a ten-day cume of $25M which would be about how much Foster’s last starring vehicle Flightplan grossed in only its first three days.3:10 to Yuma posted a solid hold last weekend and this time a similar drop could result. The Lionsgate release might dip by 35% to around $6M raising the total to $37M after 17 days.LAST YEAR: Johnny Knoxville and his partners in crime landed a big number one opening for Jackass: Number Two which bowed to $29M. The Paramount sequel went on to collect $72.8M. Focus debuted in second with another R-rated film aimed at young men, the Jet Li actioner Fearless, which grossed $10.6M. The historical pic reached $24.6M. Sony’s football drama Gridiron Gang dropped two spots to third with $9.5M in its sophomore frame. Opening poorly in fourth was the action flick Flyboys with only $6M for MGM on its way to $13.1M. The animated film Everyone’s Hero rounded out the top five with $4.7M. Premiering to dismal results was the Sean Penn vehicle All the King’s Men (the third new release to take place in the past) with $3.7M for Sony. It quickly ended its run with a poor $7.2M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"your, archives, and, movies, Mary, blockbusters, Sundance, Bravo, Studios, Biopics, black, Marathons, TCA, TV, Fantasy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Jovovich-vs-Alba-in-Multiplex-Mayhem"},{"id":"47509150789662","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Heartbreak Kid Hopes to Charm Moviegoers","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Heartbreak Kid Hopes to Charm MoviegoersSeeker, Feel the Noise also opening wide.by Gitesh Pandya | October 4, 2007 |  CommentsFollowing a six-week streak of R-rated films topping the charts, The Rock‘s family comedy The Game Plan led the box office last weekend. Now, adult fare comes back to claim the crown with the new Ben Stiller comedy The Heartbreak Kid which is aiming for an easy number one debut. Also opening nationally are the fantasy adventure The Seeker: The Dark is Rising and the music-filled drama Feel the Noise. With the Columbus Day holiday falling on Monday, some students will have extra time off making for a solid start for the month of October.Almost a decade after There’s Something About Mary became a sleeper smash, directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly reunite with Stiller for another raunchy relationship comedy with The Heartbreak Kid. A remake of the 1972 film written by Neil Simon, the Paramount release stands as another number one hit inherited from the DreamWorks factory. The pic tells the story of a man who marries too early and then falls for another woman during his honeymoon. In the past year, the R-rated envelope-pushing comedies Borat, Knocked Up, and Superbad grossed nearly $400M in combined domestic box office proving that there is gold to be mined in this genre when films are made well and deliver the laughs that audiences want.Plus star-driven comedies with major Hollywood faces routinely lure moviegoers away from the home and into the multiplexes. Heartbreak will probably not reach the $30.7M opening weekend figure of Knocked Up which had more buzz plus opened in June when most college students were out of school. But reviews so far have been quite good for this type of film so adults will certainly give it a try. And with so many dark and serious films about outlaws, vigilantes, and terrorists out there, audiences definitely want something light and funny right now. Opening in over 3,000 theaters, The Heartbreak Kid may debut with about $27M this weekend.Ben Stiller and Malin Aklerman in The Heartbreak KidThe time-travel adventure film The Seeker: The Dark is Rising heads into very wide release (possibly too wide) this weekend aiming for young boys in fantasy mode. Rated PG, the Fox release is based on the popular series of novels and will try to tap into a built-in audience of readers. Of course this is no Harry Potter and currently The Rock is doing a good job bringing in business from the lads so it will be an uphill battle at the box office. Overall buzz does not seem too strong so a huge crowd is not expected. Also there is no real starpower so the film will have to rely on special effects and fans of the literary property. Attacking 3,141 venues, The Seeker may generate around $9M over the weekend.The SeekerA Harlem rapper discovers Reggaeton music in Puerto Rico in the urban drama Feel the Noise from producer Jennifer Lopez. Sony is using her name prominently in the marketing which makes sense since there is not much starpower on screen. Latino and African-American youth are being targeted by the PG-13 film which should play mostly to a teen audience. The pic has a clear shot at this crowd since Seeker and The Game Plan skew younger and The Heartbreak Kid and The Kingdom will play older. The studio is trying to tap into the same audience that came out in surprisingly potent numbers for its past films like You Got Served and Stomp the Yard. Noise will open in half as many theaters and the buzz is a bit softer so the numbers will undoubtedly be smaller. Still an impressive average is likely. Stepping into 1,000 locations, Feel the Noise might bow to around $5M.Feel the NoiseOpening in just 15 theaters in a handful of cities is the George Clooney legal thriller Michael Clayton from Warner Bros. In the R-rated pic, the Oscar-winning actor plays a hotshot attorney who is called in to manage a crisis when his firm’s top litigator suffers a breakdown while defending a top client. Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, and Sydney Pollack co-star. Reviews have been strong and the studio hopes that buzz from a few select markets will spread when Clayton expands nationally next weekend. But a crowded marketplace for serious adult dramas will make things tough.George Clooney in Michael ClaytonThe Rock‘s kidpic The Game Plan delivered a powerful debut last weekend and with little competition from new releases, plus the Columbus Day holiday, a solid hold should result. Seeker will distract a few young boys, but overall it shouldn’t be that much of a threat. A decline of 30% could occur giving the Disney hit around $16M for the session boosting the ten-day cume to an impressive $42M.The Middle East drama The Kingdom has been ranking number one during the week since kids are busy with school and less able to see Game Plan. Universal should see a 45% drop to about $9.5M which would put the Jamie Foxx actioner at $32M after ten days. Look for Resident Evil: Extinction to slide 50% to roughly $4M leaving Sony with $43M to date.LAST YEAR: October kicked off with a bang with the top spot debut of Martin Scorsese‘s The Departed with $26.9M. Warner Bros. went on to gross $132.4M domestically and $288M worldwide plus scored four Oscars including the coveted Best Picture statue. Opening in second place with $18.5M was Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning which was the first of three horror sequels that month. New Line found its way to $39.5M. Sony’s toon hit Open Season dropped to third with $15.6M in its sophomore frame. The Lionsgate comedy Employee of the Month bowed in fourth with $11.4M on its way to $28.4M.

The R-rated entry comes from current comedy king Judd Apatow who directed Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin which collectively grossed a stunning $256M domestically. He takes on producing chores here but his involvement has wisely been promoted heavily in the film’s marketing campaign which really ignited earlier this summer with the release of the uncensored red-band trailer on the internet which basically put Superbad on the map.The marketplace for teen sex comedies has had a void since the American Pie franchise switched into direct-to-DVD mode. Superbad has the goods to make itself into this generation’s must-see raunchfest with its story of three lovable nerdy high school kids on a mission to score booze for a party to impress some girls. The lethal mix of strong marketing, filmmaker starpower, and a high-quality product that actually delivers what the audience wants will lead to a potent opening weekend that should be enough to send it to the top of the charts. And with a reported $18M budget, this could very well be the summer’s least expensive number one hit. Crashing into over 2,800 theaters, Superbad might collect around $25M this weekend.Superbad!Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig give the suspense thriller The Invasion the most starpower of any of this weekend’s new releases. The PG-13 film finds the Oscar-winning actress playing a psychiatrist and the current Bond as her doctor pal who must team up to fight an alien entity that infects the human population around the world. This latest remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers boasts some considerable star wattage which will help it get the attention of adults. Warner Bros. is hoping to appeal to the same audience that made hits out of previous late-summer adult thrillers like The Skeleton Key ($16.1M, $5,795 average)and Kidman’s The Others ($14.1M opening, $8,397 average). With no other scary movies for mature audiences, competition should not be too fierce although The Bourne Ultimatum‘s third weekend will be a formidable foe. Landing in about 2,700 locations, The Invasion could debut with around $13M.The two stars of The Invasion.The Weinstein Company unleashes its Roman empire adventure The Last Legion on Friday. The PG-13 film stars Ben Kingsley, Colin Firth, and Bollywood superstar Aishwarya Rai. Excitement in the marketplace is not too high and the push has not been very strong so modest returns are expected at the box office. The current pair of threequels topping the charts will give Legion some major competition for the action crowd. Debuting in roughly 2,000 theaters, The Last Legion could bow to about $6M.Ben Kingsley leads The Last Legion.Like most summer sequels, Rush Hour 3 should lose more than half of its opening weekend audience in the sophomore session. There is no special buzz around the action-comedy to prevent a big drop and Superbad will steal away much of the young comedy crowd. A 55% decline is likely which would put Rush Hour 3 at about $22M for the weekend and $88M after ten days.Fellow threequel The Bourne Ultimatum looks to witness a smaller decline in its third assignment. Universal might experience a 45% drop to around $18M for a robust 17-day cume of $162M.LAST YEAR: Opening weaker than expected, but still at number one, was the Samuel L. Jackson actioner Snakes on a Plane which bowed to $15.2M. New Line found its way to a disappointing $34M. Talladega Nights dropped to second with $13.8M while World Trade Center held steady in third with $10.9M. The dance sensation Step Up fell to fourth with $10.2M while Universal’s teen comedy Accepted debuted in fifth place with $10M. A $36.3M final resulted. MGM’s comedy Material Girls stumbled into ninth with a mere $4.6M on its way to only $11.4M. But opening powerfully in limited release was the mystery The Illusionist with less than $1M from only 51 theaters for a potent $18,195 average. The Yari Film Group release expanded nationally and enjoyed good legs going on to gross $39.9M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"on, The, satire, Spike, Moore, Arts, Turner, Animation","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Make-Way-for-McLovin"},{"id":"47509150793760","title":"Box Office Preview: Kingdom Hopes to Win Box Office Crown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: Kingdom Hopes to Win Box Office CrownFeast of Love, Game Plan also battle it out.by Gitesh Pandya | September 27, 2007 |  CommentsAfter two weeks of rule by Jodie and Milla, the boys come charging back in what could be a fierce fight for the number one spot. Jamie Foxx heads up the Middle East political thriller The Kingdom while The Rock targets a kinder and gentler audience with his family comedy The Game Plan. With little to no overlap in customers, both films should have room to breathe. Also debuting but in a moderate national release is the Morgan Freeman pic Feast of Love.After scoring four consecutive $100M grossers this summer, Universal aims for another trip to the number one spot with its new military drama The Kingdom. Oscar winner Jamie Foxx leads the cast playing an agent with the FBI that assembles a talented team of experts to go to Saudi Arabia against government orders to investigate a suicide bomber’s attack against Americans. Jennifer Garner, Chris Cooper, Jason Bateman, and Jeremy Piven co-star in the R-rated pic. The studio is hoping to reconnect with the same audience that powered its 2005 Iraq War drama Jarhead to a strong $27.7M bow. It’s even used Kanye West‘s music in its advertising just as it did two years ago.The Kingdom is part of a handful of fall flicks to deal with political issues in the Middle East. As one of the first ones out of the gate, it may not suffer from the backlash against this genre that may eventually be created. Marketed as a revenge picture featuring Americans fighting back against those who wronged us, the Peter Berg-directed film should tap into a certain segment of the audience that will find comfort in this type of fare. But competition for adults will be a factor especially considering how seven of the top eight films last weekend were rated R. Reviews have been mixed, however starpower is ample which should compensate. Infiltrating more than 2,700 theaters, The Kingdom might open with approximately $19M this weekend.Jamie Foxx and co. in The Kingdom.A superstar quarterback’s life is thrown into disarray when he meets the daughter he never knew he had in Disney’s The Game Plan starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. The PG-rated entry enters multiplexes in the early weeks of the football season and at a time when there are zero options for families meaning the timing could not be better. The concept should sell to moms, dads, and kids alike. Plus, the studio found great success with this format two years ago when it put muscular action star Vin Diesel into the family comedy The Pacifier and drove $30.6M worth of business into theaters on opening weekend.Of course Diesel, Ice Cube, and other macho men have been showing their softer side in kidpics lately so the idea is not totally new. The studio’s sneak previews last weekend helped to get more buzz out there with the target demo and with the lack of direct competition, Game Plan should have smooth sailing with parents and children. The marketing push has been effective as Disney has proven with films like Wild Hogs that it can sell just about any type of star-driven comedy to the public. Charging into about 2,800 locations, The Game Plan could grab around $17M this weekend.The Rock stars in The Game Plan.Morgan Freeman, Greg Kinnear, and Selma Blair star in the new drama Feast of Love which quietly enters the marketplace on Friday as the frame’s third new wide opener. Directed by Robert Benton, the R-rated collection of intertwining stories set in Oregon will play exclusively to a mature adult audience. MGM has not been pushing the film too much and the release is not very wide so the film’s potential is limited. Women should outnumber men by a small margin. Landing in about 1,200 sites, a $2M debut could result.Morgan Freeman and Greg Kinnear in Feast of Love.The Tommy Lee Jones drama In the Valley of Elah will expand to roughly 700 theaters nationwide on Friday as it enters its third weekend of release and will try to pop into the top ten. The Paul Haggis-directed pic got off to a solid start by platforming in nine theaters to a $14,840 average. However, things slowed down considerably last weekend during its expansion to 317 playdates which eroded its average down to $3,996. The Warner Independent title struggled as it moved into more major markets and this weekend should see its average get diluted further. A weekend tally of about $2M seems likely.Tommy Lee Jones in Elah.A mighty tumble awaits current box office champ Resident Evil: Extinction which is coming off of the biggest bow in the series. The first two Evil pics each suffered a steep 62% drop in the second weekend. A similar drop should result for this third chapter giving Extinction about $9.5M for the frame and $38M in ten days.The Dane Cook–Jessica Alba comedy Good Luck Chuck is also following up on a solid debut. Most of the fans of the actors probably came out upfront so a 50% fall to around $7M seems likely. That would give Lionsgate a ten-day cume of $24M.LAST YEAR Sony topped the charts with its animated offering Open Season which debuted to an impressive $23.6M on its way to $85.1M. Ashton Kutcher voiced the number one film and starred on-screen opposite Kevin Costner in the second place pic The Guardian which opened to $18M. the Buena Vista release went on to collect $55M.

Most of the debutingfilms were met with disappointing sales since ticket buyers spent their time andmoney catching up on popular holdover titles which commanded the top threespots.The supercool kids of Superbad remained the leaders of the pack with an estimated weekendgross of $18M, falling 46% from last weekend. After ten days, the Sony smash hastaken in an impressive $68.6M and could be on its way to $120M or more. Thatwould give the raunchy hit a domestic gross nearly seven times its productioncost of $18M. Superbad is the first summer film to spend back-to-backweekends at number one since Pirates ofthe Caribbean: At World’s End which bowed over Memorial Day weekend inMay. Sony has now claimed the number one film nine times in 2007, more than anyother studio.Rising one spot to second place wasMatt Damon‘slatest assassin flick The Bourne Ultimatumwhich slipped only 38% to an estimated $12.4M. It was the fourth bestfourth-weekend gross of any summer film this year after the threequeltriumvirate of Shrek the Third ($15.3M),Spider-Man 3 ($14.3M), and Pirates($12.4M). With $185.1M in the bank for Universal, Bourne has now outgrossedevery James Bond film domestically (in nominal dollar terms), both previousBourne films, and two of the three Mission: Impossible pics. Ultimatumis stillon track to hit the $200M mark by the end of Labor Day weekend and will give aserious challenge to this decade’s top action films that are not driven byspecial effects – Rush Hour 2 ($226.2M in 2001) and Mission: Impossible 2($215.4M in 2000).&nbsp;New Line’s action-comedy sequelRush Hour 3 fell 43%to an estimated $12.3M in its third mission.

The overall NorthAmerican box office continued its red hot pace significantly beating outyear-ago levels yet again on its way to possibly ending the summer season with anew record.Sony captured the top spot for the first time since early May with Superbadwhich powered ahead of expectations to bow to an estimated $31.2M. The R-ratedtale of three nerdy high school pals on a wild search to get booze to impresstheir lady friends averaged a potent $10,583 from 2,948 locations. The openingeven beat out the $30.7M debut of June’s Knocked Up from directorJudd Apatowand actor Seth Rogen. Apatow produced Superbad which co-starred and wasco-written by Rogen. Critics were quite impressed with McLovin and friends andgave the film high marks. (Clickhere forour interview with the stars of Superbad.)The studio pushed the teen comedy for months with a well-executed marketingcampaign which included a popular uncensored trailer and touring the main actorsaround the country for promotional events. Superbad delivered the second biggestopening for an R-rated film this year only trailing 300. The two are the only R pics to reach number one at all in 2007. With a production cost of only $18M,the comedy will easily become a healthy moneymaker for Sony. But the film’stroubling Friday-to-Saturday drop of 15% could mean that fans rushed out upfrontas if this were a sequel and that big dropoffs could be on the horizon. Still itwas the second biggest opening ever in the traditionally slow second half ofAugust behind just Freddy vs. Jason which debuted to $36.4M in 2003. Studioresearchshowed that the audience was 52% male and 60% in the 18-34 bracket.Rush Hour 3 fell 56% in its second weekend and slipped to the runnerup spot withan estimated $21.8M pushing the ten-day cume to $88.2M. The New Line actionsequel should find its way to about $135-140M from North America. Like most ofthis summer’s threequels, Rush Hour 3 will end its domestic run well behind thegross of its predecessor.The one threequel to break that trend is The Bourne Ultimatum which followed inthird place this weekend with an estimated $19M, off only 42%. Universal’slatest action entry has taken in a stellar $163.8M in only 17 days and shouldsurpass the $176.1M of 2004’s The Bourne Supremacy by the end of the week tobecome the top-grossing film of the franchise. Grossing an estimated $6.7M inits fourth frame, down 41%, was The Simpsons Movie which has taken in$165.1M for Fox to date.Starpower from Nicole Kidman andDaniel Craig meant nothing at the box officefor their new sci-fi thriller The Invasion which bombed with an opening of just$6M, according to estimates. Playing wide in 2,776 theaters, the PG-13 remake ofInvasion of the Body Snatchers averaged a measly $2,161 per site. TheWarner Bros. release earned mostly negative reviews.Paramount’s fairy tale adventure Stardust fell 43% to an estimated $5.2M for aten-day sum of just $19.1M. A $30-35M final seems likely. The musical smashHairspray joined the century club over the weekend grossing an estimated $4.3Mfor New Line, down just 33%, for a total of $100.7M. Disney’s Underdogdropped 43% to an estimated $3.6M to boost its tally to $31.7M.Falling to ninth place was Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which tookin an estimated $3.5M, off just 35%, giving Warner Bros. $278.6M from NorthAmerica. Overseas, the fifth wizard tale collected an estimated $16.2M from 61territories boosting the international cume to $594M and the global gross to a stunning $873M. Rounding out the top ten wasAdam Sandler andKevin James inthe Universal comedy I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry which madean estimated $3.5M, down 41%, for a total of $110.4M thus far.Opening with weak results outside of the top ten was the historical epic The Last Legion starringBen Kingsley,Colin Firth, andAishwarya Rai which launchedwith an estimated $2.6M from 2,002 playdates for a dismal $1,297 average.Debuting with respectable results in limited release was MGM’s Death at aFuneral which bowed to an estimated $1.3M from 260 theaters for a $5,012average.Warner Independent platformedLeonardoDiCaprio‘s documentary The 11th Hour inNew York and Los Angeles and generated a strong start. The PG-rated pic looking at environmental problems grossed an estimated $56,000 from four sitesfor a muscular $14,000 average. Hour expands to the top ten markets on Friday.Two films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. The Warner Bros. pic NoReservations took in an estimated $2.3M, off 39%, giving theCatherineZeta-Jones film $36.5M to date. A $40-43M final seems likely. Sony’s Daddy DayCamp fell 47% in its second outing to an estimated $1.8M for a weak $8.8Mafter ten days. TheCuba Gooding Jr. sequel should stumble to a final take ofjust $12M which will be a far cry from the $104.3M ofEddie Murphy’sDaddy DayCare in the summer of 2003.The top ten films grossed an estimated $104.9M which was up 21% from last yearwhen Snakes on a Plane opened in first place with $15.2M; and up 13% from2005 when The 40-Year-Old Virgin debuted in the top spot with $21.4M.Author: Gitesh Pandya,www.BoxOfficeGuru.com&nbsp;","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"story, to, The, Plus, BET","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Superbad-Opens-Big-at-1"},{"id":"47509152556079","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Sandler Tops Potter for #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Sandler Tops Potter for #1 SpotChuck and Larry sitting in a tree, B-O-X-O-F-F-I-C-E-K-I-N-G.by Gitesh Pandya | July 22, 2007 |  CommentsAdam Sandlerscored the ninth number one opening of his career with his latest comedy INow Pronounce You Chuck and Larry which edged out former champ Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix for the top spot at the NorthAmerican box office. The frame’s only other wide opener Hairspray enjoyed amagical debut of its own with a strong third place bow. Overall, moviegoersspread their dollars around as for first time in more than three years, fourfilms grossed over $20M each over the same weekend.Universal won a slim box office victory with the launch of Chuck and Larry which grossed an estimated $34.8M to lead the frame.Debuting in 3,495 theaters, the PG-13 pic about two straight firefighters whopretend to be gay for the domestic partner benefits averaged an impressive$9,950 per location. Though a solid first place performance, Chuck and Larryalso delivered the worst opening for one ofSandler’s broadlive-action comedies since the 2000 flop Little Nicky.His more dramatic turns in films like Spanglish and Reign Over Mehave attracted modest openings, but his mainstream laughers typically debut nearthe $40M mark. Sandler still stands a good chance of earning a $100M blockbusterfor the sixth consecutive year.Falling down one spot to the runnerup position was Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which grossed an estimated$32.2M in its sophomore session. Down a steep 58%, the Warner Bros. releaselifted its 12-day cume to a stunning $207.5M. Second weekend declines aretypically large for high-profile tentpole films. Phoenix’s drop was a bitsmaller than the 62% for both Spider-Man 3 andPiratesof the Caribbean: At World’s End which each debuted on a Friday in May.However, it was larger than the drops for fellow midweek openers Live Free orDie Hard and Transformerswhich witnessed sophomore declines of 47% and 48%, respectively.The new Potter film had to compete with the arrival of the seventh andfinal wizard book on Saturday which appealed to the exact same audience andprobably kept many away from the multiplexes. Still the gross to date comparesfavorably to the $201M that the last film Goblet of Fire generated by the end of its second weekend in November2005. That tally however was over two fewer days but did have the benefit of theThanksgiving holiday. With the summer playing period, Phoenix stands agood chance of matching the $290M of Goblet and could even crack the$300M mark. Together with Transformers, that would give this summer arecord five megablockbusters crossing the $300M threshold.Helped by monster openings in Japan and Russia, the fifth wizard tale grossed astaggering $100.8M overseas this weekend to boost the international tally to$351.3M. That puts the global box office for Order of the Phoenix at atowering $559M after only 12 days. This weekend the Harry Potter moviefranchise also crossed a major milestone as the global box office for all fivefilms combined shattered the $4 billion mark.New Line attracted a large audience to its musical comedy Hairspray whichopened better than expected at number three with an estimated $27.8M. Playing in3,121 houses, the PG-rated film averaged a stellar $8,907 and gave the studioits best opening in two years. Hairspray earned rave reviews from criticsand starred a diverse cast that allowed the marketing team to target differentaudiences. Hollywood veteransJohn Travolta andMichelle Pfeifferhelped bring in adult moviegoers,Amanda Bynes andZac Efron caught theattention of teens, Queen Latifah helped give the film appeal to African American moviegoers,and newcomer Nikki Blonsky hit the talk show circuit making everyday Americans feel theytoo can win their shot at movie stardom. Many audience segments found somethinghere to like.Transformers banked another $20.5M, according to estimates, and saw itstotal soar to $263M. Off 45% in its third weekend, the Paramount/DreamWorksproduction climbed to number 34 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusterspassing the $262M of 2002’s Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.The animated rodent film Ratatouilledropped 39% to fifth place with an estimated $11M in its fourth outing to boostthe cume to $165.6M. Although the acclaimed comedy is on its way past the $200Mmark, it will end up being Pixar’s lowest-grossing film since 1998’s A Bug’s Life. Fox’saction sequel Live Free orDie Hard followed in sixth with an estimated $7.3M, off 35%, lifting thetotal to $116.5M. By Tuesday the new installment will become the top-grossing Die Hard film edging past the $117.3M of 1990’s Die Hard 2, howeverticket prices were much lower when all previous John McClane pics were released.The Warner Bros. comedy License toWed fell 49% to an estimated $3.8M and gave theRobin Williamsfilm $38.7M to date. The hit thriller 1408 scared up anestimated $2.6M, down 47%, giving MGM a cume of $67.5M.Universal rounded out the top ten with a pair of comedies from the men behind The 40-Year-OldVirgin. SteveCarell’s EvanAlmighty grossed an estimated $2.5M, down 50%, for a $93.5M sum. Butdirector Judd Apatow has been the bigger winner with Knocked Up whichslipped 37% to an estimated $2.3M raising the stellar total to $142.7M andcounting. Final domestic grosses should be roughly $100M and $150M,respectively.In limited release, Fox Searchlight’s sci-fi thriller Sunshine opened wellwith an estimated $235,000 from only ten locations for a scorching $23,548average. The Danny Boyle-directedpic expands on Friday to over 400 theaters nationwide. Also posting a solidaverage was Don Cheadle’sTalk to Me with anestimated $342,000 from 36 sites for a commendable $9,491 average. The totalsits at $895,000 with an expansion set for Friday as well.A pair of films fell from the top ten over the weekend.Michael Moore’shealth care documentary Sicko dipped 26% to an estimated $1.9M pushing the overall cume to$19.2M. A final take of about $25M seems likely for the Lionsgate release. Thecaper sequel Ocean’s Thirteen grossed an estimated $1.1M in its seventh heist, down47%, for a $114.6M cume to date. A final North American tally of approximately$118M seems likely which would be just 6% less than the $125.5M of 2004’sOcean’s Twelve.The top ten films grossed an estimated $144.7M which was up 5% from last yearwhen Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest remained at number one forthe third time with $35.2M; and up 17% from 2005 when Johnny Depp also ruledwith Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which took in $28.3M in its sophomoresession.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Sandler-Tops-Potter-for-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509152558128","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Can Chuck and Larry Beat Up Harry?","content":"\n\n                                            Weekend Box Office\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Box Office Guru Preview: Can Chuck and Larry Beat Up Harry?\n                        \n                        by Gitesh Pandya | July 19, 2007                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                Two new star-driven Hollywood comedies face off at the box office this weekend in an attempt to unseat Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix from the top spot. Adam Sandler headlines the gay marriage pic I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry while John Travolta goes one step further starring as a heavy-set mom in the musical Hairspray. For the first time in nearly a month, no new release gets an early midweek headstart.\nAdam Sandler is back for his annual trip to blockbusterland in Chuck and Larry starring with Kevin James and Jessica Biel. The PG-13 film reunites Sandler with director Dennis Dugan (Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore)\nand tells the story of two heterosexual firefighters who pretend to be married to each other to take advantage of the financial benefits. The former Saturday Night Live star only does one film per year and each comedy has a specific well-defined plot. That has led to a string of hits at the box office as fans so far have not had too much of him. Earlier this year, Eddie Murphy reached $34.2M with Norbit‘s opening while Will Ferrell bowed to $33M with Blades of Glory. Chuck should go a little higher.\n\nThe former wedding singer has scored $100M blockbusters in each of the last five years and aims to extend the streak to six with his latest summer offering. Last June, his comedy Click bowed to $40M on its way to $137.3M while 2005’s The Longest Yard debuted to $47.6M over three days before heading to a $158.1M final. Sandler is one of the most reliable box office draws in the business and his usual fan following, skewing a bit more male, should be back again this time. Reviews have been bad as usual but should not factor in much. Potter and Transformers will still provide some competition for young males and females may be swayed more to Hairspray. Universal’s marketing push has been on par with past films from the actor and Sandler has been hitting up all the standard talk shows for his yearly sales pitches. Tying the knot in 3,492 theaters, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry could open to about $37M.\n\n\nThe happy couple\n\n\nJohn Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, Christopher Walken,\nAmanda Bynes, and newcomer Nicole Blonsky join forces for the lavish musical Hairspray, the 2007 movie version of the popular Broadway version of the 1988 cult film from John Waters. The new PG-rated pic has earned glowing praise from critics which will certainly help its cause in a summer full of action hits aimed at young males. Hairspray will skew more female and could appeal to multiple generations given the broad range of stars from teen queens to middle-aged sex symbols. \n\nNew Line does not have an easy sell here. However the studio was wise to program the release into the second half of summer knowing that audiences may be all actioned out by now and looking for something different. Musicals rarely hit the big screen during the summer although in 2001 Moulin Rouge opened wide to $13.7M and a $6,019 average leading to a respectable $57.4M gross. Hairspray hopes to become a hit like Chicago and Dreamgirls, rather than a dud like Rent or The Producers. Broadway musicals don’t always translate well onto the big screen but starpower often helps to make them click with moviegoers. Hairspray boasts a solid line-up of Hollywood stars and with strong reviews should\nattract a good following at the box office. Dancing into more than 3,000 theaters, the Adam Shankman-directed film could collect about $19M this weekend.\n\n","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"San, book, Pop, Funimation, kaiju, Television, Holiday, sequels, TV, the, cartoon, curtis, Masterpiece","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Can-Chuck-and-Larry-Beat-Up-Harry"},{"id":"47509152568373","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Evan\" Not-So-Mighty Opens at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Evan\" Not-So-Mighty Opens at #1by Gitesh Pandya | June 24, 2007 |  CommentsSteve Carell took over the number one spot this weekend with his new comedy \"Evan Almighty,\" but it failed to generate the flood of business needed to recoup its mammoth production cost.The John Cusack thriller \"1408\" debuted to strong results while \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" fell sharply in its second mission. Weekend sales were too close to call for the two which were separated by only $25,000 according to estimates. Overall, the North American box office posted solid, but not spectacular results for this time of year.Audiences lined up two by two for \"Evan Almighty\" which captured the top spot this weekend with an estimated $32.1M. The PG-rated sequel bowed to less than half of the $68M Friday-to-Sunday debut of its 2003 predecessor \"Bruce Almighty\" while costing more than twice as much. Playing in 3,604 locations, \"Evan\" averaged a solid $8,910 per ark. Morgan Freeman returned to play God and director Tom Shadyac was also back behind the camera, but Jim Carrey did not take part again. Universal spent a reported $175M producing its big summer comedy offering which was aimed at family audiences with its storyline involving animals and its PG rating. Reviews were mostly negative.Thanks to a heavy special effects budget and a production that went behind schedule but still needed to be completed in time for its set release date, \"Evan Almighty\" turned into one of the priciest comedies in history reaching a budget common usually only seen for high-profile action sequels. The film will need good legs, a strong international run, and hefty video sales in order to break even. According to studio research, 52% of the audience was over the age of 25, 45% consisted of families, and moviegoers polled by CinemaScore gave the pic an encouraging A- grade. However, the film scored a weaker B average grade from over 2,000 votes on Yahoo Movies.It was still a milestone weekend for struggling Universal Pictures which has released a number of turkeys over the past year. The studio scored its first number one opener since last August’s \"Miami Vice\" and its first $100M grosser since last June’s \"The Break-Up\" with Knocked Up.Opening surprisingly well in second place was the psychological thriller \"1408\" with an estimated $20.2M for MGM and The Weinstein Co. The John Cusack hit averaged a frighteningly strong $7,534 from 2,678 theaters. Rated PG-13, 1408 tells of a writer who checks into a haunted hotel room that dozens of others have died in. Samuel L. Jackson co-stars in the film which is based on a Stephen King short story. With so many horror films, even from proven franchises, failing at the box office in recent months, \"1408\" energized audiences and delivered a solid opening. It was the second biggest debut of the year for a fright flick behind the $22.2M bow of \"Disturbia,\" another PG-13 psychological thriller set mostly indoors.In a virtual tie for second place was last weekend’s winner \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" which tumbled 65% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $20.2M as well. Fox’s super hero sequel suffered a big blow, but it wasn’t a total surprise considering the 59% second-weekend drop of the first \"Fantastic\" pic and the fact that sequels often erode quicker. \"Silver Surfer\" has captured $97.6M in ten days and seems on a course to finish with $135-140M which would be slightly behind the $154.7M of its predecessor.\"Ocean’s Thirteen\" ranked fourth with an estimated $11.4M in its third caper, off just 43%, giving Warner Bros. a healthy $91M to date. The George Clooney–Brad Pitt heist pic is running 5% behind the pace of 2001’s \"Ocean’s Eleven\" at the same point in its run but 5% ahead of 2004’s \"Ocean’s Twelve.\" \"Thirteen\" looks headed for the $125M mark in North America. Overseas, the new chapter grossed an estimated $21.3M from 49 markets to raise the international tally to a cool $100M and the global gross to $191M.For the second straight weekend, Universal’s sleeper hit \"Knocked Up\" dipped by less than 30% and remained in double digit millions. The Judd Apatow-directed smash grossed an estimated $10.6M, off only 24%, and pushed its cume to $109M joining the century club on Friday in its 22nd day of release. \"Knocked Up\" continues to show the same great legs that made fellow R-rated summer comedies like \"Wedding Crashers\" and \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" such big hits two summers ago. A final tally of $140-150M might result.\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" followed in sixth with an estimated $7.2M, down 42%, boosting the cume to $287M. The Johnny Depp high seas adventure rose to number 29 on the all-time domestic blockbusters list after 2005’s \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" which grossed $290M. A final North American tally of around $305M seems likely for the expensive Buena Vista sequel. Overseas, \"At World’s End\" collected an estimated $20.4M pushing the international tally to $584.6M and the worldwide haul to a jaw-dropping $871.6M. Captain Jack will swing past \"Spider-Man 3\"’s roughly $880M global haul by the end of the week on its way to possibly $950M. The two juggernauts have combined for a towering $1.75 billion in worldwide box office so far.Sony’s animated comedy \"Surf’s Up\" held up well despite the arrival of Evan and grossed an estimated $6.7M dipping only 28%. The penguin pic has captured $47.3M to date. Rival toon \"Shrek the Third\" followed with an estimated $5.8M, off 36%, for a $307.9M total. That put the latest ogre tale at number 22 on the all-time domestic list passing \"Independence Day\" which grossed $306.2M in 1996 when ticket prices were much lower.. Look for Donkey and his pals to finish with roughly $330M from North America. Warner Bros. placed ninth with \"Nancy Drew\" which fell 34% to an estimated $4.5M giving the sleuth pic $16.2M in ten days.Opening in tenth place was Angelina Jolie’s \"A Mighty Heart\" with an estimated $4M from 1,355 theaters for a mild $2,956 average. The Paramount Vantage release earned strong reviews and has sparked Oscar buzz for Jolie’s performance as Mariane Pearl, widow of the slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. The R-rated film skewed to an audience of mature women with studio research showing that over 60% of the crowd was female and more than 60% was over 30.Lionsgate saw sensational results for the new Michael Moore documentary \"Sicko\" which platformed in only one Manhattan theater but still grossed an estimated $70,000 over the weekend. The distributor will open the PG-13 look at the U.S. health care system on Friday across the country. \"Sicko\"’s average was especially notable since it only occupied one screen at its theater. Often, when specialty films platform to such astonishing averages, they play in two or three screens within the same theater.Three very different films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. MGM’s Kevin Costner thriller \"Mr. Brooks\" fell 47% to an estimated $1.5M for a cume to date of $26.6M. A $30M final seems likely. \"Hostel Part II\" grossed an estimated $1M, down 67%, for a $17M total. The torture sequel should end with about $18M which would be a 62% fall from the $47.4M of the first \"Hostel\" flick.Also dropping down was the year’s biggest blockbuster \"Spider-Man 3.\" After seven weeks in the top ten, the webslinger tale declined by 48% to an estimated $1.3M and boosted its incredible cume to $332.5M. Sony now finds itself at number 15 on the all-time domestic chart behind \"Finding Nemo\" which gobbled up $339.7M four years ago. \"Spider-Man 3\" should finish in the friendly neighborhood of $337M making it the lowest-grossing installment of the series in North America. However, its international tally of more than $545M already makes it the biggest \"Spidey\" overseas and the combined global gross of about $880M makes it the biggest Peter Parker pic ever worldwide. The first two \"Spider-Man\" films grossed $822M and $784M respectively and while the third chapter lost audience members domestically, it more than made up for it with gains internationally.The top ten films grossed an estimated $122.6M which was down 2% from last year when \"Click\" opened at number one with $40M; but up 8% from 2005 when \"Batman Begins\" remained in the top spot with $27.6M in its second weekend.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"christmas, WarnerMedia, in, Disney, Schmidt, Esquire, Fire, Avengers, The, HBO, thriller, Classic, Awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Evan-NotSoMighty-Opens-at-1"},{"id":"47509154201654","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Evan Shall Lead the Way","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Evan Shall Lead the Wayby Gitesh Pandya | June 21, 2007 |  CommentsUniversal looks to score its first number one hit in nearly a year this weekend with the new Steve Carell comedy \"Evan Almighty\" which hits the multiplexes on Friday targeting a broad family audience.Reaching out to adult moviegoers are MGM with the John Cusack chiller \"1408\" and Paramount Vantage with the Angelina Jolie starrer \"A Mighty Heart.\" Overall, the marketplace could slow down a bit this weekend before another wave of high-profile summer blockbusters arrives towards the end of June.The sixth consecutive sequel to open at number one has a different formula up its sleeve. \"Evan Almighty\" loses Jim Carrey from \"Bruce Almighty,\" drops the rating from PG-13 to PG, and shifts the plot over to a Biblical story while courting family audiences. Michael Bay isn’t the only one with a transformer at the box office this summer. Universal’s big-budget comedy offering should easily top the charts, however the financial picture will be very different. Steve Carell, whose starpower has blossomed since the 2003’s \"Bruce,\" takes over as the lead playing a TV anchorman-turned-congressman who is told by God to build an ark because a mighty flood is coming. Morgan Freeman reprises his supporting role as the big G.On a budget rumored to have ballooned to $175M thanks to extensive special effects and overages, \"Evan Almighty\" stands as one of the priciest comedies ever. The loss of Jim Carrey means it has almost no chance of reaching the $68M three-day opening weekend gross of \"Bruce\" from four years ago when it shocked the film industry by kicking \"The Matrix Reloaded\" out of the top spot in only its second frame. It reached a domestic haul of $242.8M. \"Evan Almighty\" could conceivably gross half the amount of \"Bruce,\" while costing twice as much to produce. Does that mean it will lose money? Not necessarily. \"Evan\" would love nothing more than to follow in the footsteps of \"Night at the Museum,\" another effects-driven comedy led by a popular comedian aimed at families, which has grossed over $570M worldwide. If it can tap into that crowd, then it will be a divine road ahead.\"Evan\"’s trim running time of about 90 minutes will help since multiplexes can schedule numerous showtimes per day. Competition will come from current chart-topper \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,\" another action-comedy sequel tamed down to a PG to cater to eight-year-old boys on summer vacation. Teens and young adults who have to wait until the fall to see new episodes of Carell’s \"The Office\" may line up for \"Evan\" and give it a try, despite the negative reviews. There’s not much else exciting that demo right now. And given its themes, moviegoers in the Bible Belt may contribute some solid sales on opening weekend as the studio is wisely targeting churches in its marketing outreach. Opening in 3,602 theaters, \"Evan Almighty\" could premiere to about $40M this weekend.\"Evan Almighty\"John Cusack hopes to avoid the current horror curse at the box office with his new psychological thriller \"1408.\" The MGM release finds the actor playing a writer who checks into a haunted hotel room that many have died in. Samuel L. Jackson co-stars in the PG-13 pic. Scary movies have been slaughtered at the cash registers lately. Even star-driven adult thrillers have struggled as witnessed by openings of $11.2M for \"Perfect Stranger\" starring Halle Berry and Bruce Willis, $10M for Hilary Swank‘s \"The Reaping,\" $10M for Kevin Costner‘s \"Mr. Brooks,\" and $7.6M for Luke Wilson‘s hotel-themed \"Vacancy.\" Managing to surge a bit higher were Sandra Bullock‘s \"Premonition\" with $17.6M and Jim Carrey’s \"The Number 23\" with $14.6M. \"1408\" may not scare up that much business given consumer apathy towards fright flicks right now. Plus Cusack and Jackson are not really known for packing them in on opening weekend unless there are bigger stars present. Checking into 2,678 theaters, \"1408\" might take in about $12M this weekend.John Cusack in \"1408\"Angelina Jolie headlines this weekend’s serious offering for adult audiences, \"A Mighty Heart.\" Directed by Michael Winterbottom (\"The Road to Guantanamo,\" \"Welcome to Sarajevo\"), the R-rated film finds the Oscar-winning actress playing Mariane Pearl, wife of slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, and documents her struggle to find her kidnapped husband in Pakistan. In a summer of sequels and effects-driven action pictures for kids on vacation, Paramount Vantage is going after the adults that are often neglected at this time of year. Reviews for \"Heart\" have been strong with Jolie already earning kudos buzz and the film should appeal to the same audiences that came out for other acclaimed political thrillers like \"United 93\" ($11.5M, $6,395 average), \"The Constant Gardener\" ($8.7M, $6,444), and \"Syriana\" ($11.7M, $6,699). Competition will come from \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" and \"Knocked Up\" which have both been playing well with the 30-plus crowd. Debuting in about 1,350 theaters, \"A Mighty Heart\" might open in the vicinity of $7M.Angelina Jolie in \"A Mighty Heart\"Last weekend, Fox’s \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" opened at the top and was just one of six sequels to land in the top ten. Its 2005 predecessor tumbled 59% in its second weekend thanks to poor word-of-mouth and intense competition from newcomers \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and \"Wedding Crashers\" which stole over $90M worth of ticket sales away from holdover pics. \"Silver Surfer\" has been greeted with marginally better responses and will not face as much competition from the incoming class this weekend, although \"Evan Almighty\" will be gunning for that PG-loving family crowd. A drop of 55% would give the new \"Fantastic Four\" saga around $25M for the frame and a ten-day cume of $103M.\"Ocean’s Thirteen\" will see some of its adult audience get pulled away by the weekend’s two new mature-skewing flicks. A 40% decline will leave the caper sequel with roughly $12M pushing the total to $91M after 17 days for Warner Bros. Universal’s comedy sensation \"Knocked Up\" will smash through the $100M mark this weekend, probably on Friday. Look for a 30% fall to around $10M boosting the cume to $108M.LAST YEAR: Adam Sandler scored his usual table at the top spot with his comedy \"Click\" which bowed to $40M for Sony on its way to $137.3M domestically and over $235M worldwide. The Disney/Pixar toon \"Cars\" dropped to the runnerup spot but dipped only 31% to $23.3M. Sophomores \"Nacho Libre\" and \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" were both hit hard and tumbled by more than 50% each to $12.7M and $9.8M, respectively. Focus launched the Tyrese Gibson actioner \"Waist Deep\" to a solid $9.4M from just over 1,000 theaters on its way to $21.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"adventure, Sematary, blockbuster, Month, blaxploitation, BBC, crossover, Disney, Paramount, Winners, diversity","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Evan-Shall-Lead-the-Way"},{"id":"47509152542763","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Chan and Tucker Back in Action","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Chan and Tucker Back in ActionDuo Tries to Recreate the Boxoffice Magic a Third Timeby Gitesh Pandya | August 9, 2007 |  CommentsAnother wide assortment of summer offerings will hit the multiplexes across North America this weekend. The action-comedy sequel Rush Hour 3 leads the way as the main course and will be joined by side dishes like the fantasy adventure Stardust, the family comedy Daddy Day Camp, and the horror flick Skinwalkers. The third mega-opening in a row should keep overall ticket sales abnormally high for this time of year.Six years and one week after the last installment opened, Rush Hour 3 hits theaters from coast to coast hoping to recapture the magic that made its two predecessors shatter industry expectations. Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, and director Brett Ratner have all reteamed (with some handsome raises) for a story about the world’s biggest organized crime syndicate whose secrets are hidden in Paris. The first Rush Hour smashed the September opening weekend box office record with a $33M launch in 1998. Rush Hour 2 set a new August opening record in 2001 with its $67.4M debut which it held until last weekend’s The Bourne Ultimatum arrived. Together, Carter and Lee have arrested $367M domestically and $575M worldwide with their pair of cross-cultural buddy cop hits.But a lot of time has passed since the last Rush Hour film and some fans may have lost interest in a formula that can easily get tired the third time around. The new pic should play mostly to existing fans and will not create too many new ones. Still, Rush Hour 3 does offer the most ethnic starpower of any film this summer so business from multicultural moviegoers should be very strong. Jason Bourne’s second weekend will provide ample competition for the action crowd, then again Rush Hour 2 had to deal with the second weekend of Planet of the Apes which opened the week before with a similarly potent $68.5M which at the time was the second biggest opening in history. So Chan and Tucker can handle the pressure. Expect those who like this dish to come back for a third helping for what should be the final big bow of the summer season. Crashing into more than 3,100 theaters, Rush Hour 3 could speed to about $61M this weekend.Chan and Tucker in familiar territory.The stars come out for Stardust, a new fantasy adventure boasting a cast that includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Claire Danes, Robert De Niro, and Sienna Miller. The PG-13 pic should skew more to a female audience since males have more high-profile choices if they’re looking for action this weekend. Paramount has put a moderate amount of marketing support behind the film – an adequate amount for an August release. But with The Bourne Ultimatum and Rush Hour 3 absorbing roughly $90M in combined business from a broad audience, things will be tough for Stardust and for any other film for that matter. Debuting in about 2,300 locations, an opening weekend of around $11M could result.Stardust hopes to produce another form of green.The summer’s oddest couple entered theaters on Wednesday in Daddy Day Camp, a new family comedy starring Oscar-winner Cuba Gooding Jr. which is directed by The Wonder Years star Fred Savage. The PG-rated film is a followup to 2003’s Eddie Murphy hit Daddy Day Care which bowed to $27.6M on its way to a solid $104.3M for Sony. In a world where direct-to-DVD sequels get financed for just about any kids property, Camp seems like just that, only one which got lucky enough to get a theatrical release. Cuba is no Eddie when it comes to selling tickets. Sure, Snow Dogs grossed $81.2M in 2002, but Disney’s brand name and marketing machine were responsible for much of that success. Luckily for Sony there are not too many options for families right now so there is an opportunity, though a small one. Daddy Day Camp hit 2,184 theaters on Wednesday and could collect about $8M for the weekend and around $11M over five days.Perhaps Cuba is beginning to understand why Eddie didn’t return.Following in the footsteps of I Know Who Killed Me, Captivity, and Bug, the new horror flick Skinwalkers steps into the ring gunning for the title of worst fright flop of the summer. From Lionsgate and After Dark Films, the PG-13 pic has little marketing or distribution support and is only making a brief appearance at the marquees on its way to video store shelves. Debuting in just 650 theaters, an opening weekend of $1.5M seems likely.Skinwalkers!The Bourne Ultimatum made a big splash in its debut last weekend recording the largest August bow in history. However, it has been eroding during the week posting a solid $9.1M on Monday before dropping down to $7.5M on Tuesday. The large upfront turnout should lead to a sharp decline and Rush Hour 3‘s arrival will take away action fans too. Look for a 55% drop for the Matt Damon saga which would give Universal about $31M for the frame and a ten-day tally of $129M.Fox’s hit toon The Simpsons Movie, already the third highest grossing animated film of the year after the ogre threequel and the rodent comedy, should stabilize this weekend after its hefty sophomore slump of two-thirds. A 50% decline would give Homer and pals around $12.5M for the weekend and a 17-day total of $153M.LAST YEAR: Will Ferrell stayed put at number one with the hit comedy Talladega Nights despite a 53% drop to $22.1M in its second lap for Sony. Buena Vista raced past expectations with its teen sensation Step Up which bowed in the number two spot with a stellar $20.7M on its way to $65.3M. Paramount’s 9/11 drama World Trade Center debuted in third with $18.7M over three days and $26.5M over five days. The Oliver Stone pic went on to gross a solid $70.3M. The studio’s animated film Barnyard slipped only 39% in its sophomore session to $9.7M taking fourth place. Opening to mild results in fifth was the thriller Pulse with $8.2M on its way to $20.3M for The Weinstein Co. Sony crashed and burned in ninth with the kidpic Zoom which bowed to just $4.5M leading to a weak $11.6M final.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"worst, Diego, TBS, E3, Arrangement, Geographic, HBO, Walt, It, Nat","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Chan-and-Tucker-Back-in-Action"},{"id":"47509152546860","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Bourne Beats Bart for Box Office Crown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Bourne Beats Bart for Box Office CrownGood night, Springden. There will be no encore.by Gitesh Pandya | August 5, 2007 |  CommentsMatt Damon set anew opening weekend record for the month of August with the top spot bow ofThe Bourne Ultimatum,the third installment in the actor’s signature spy series. The frame’s other newreleases saw more modest openings while most holdovers held up well. The wideassortment of popular hits allowed the North American box office to soar to thehighest grossing August weekend in history.Racing past expectations, Universal’sThe Bourne Ultimatumscored a spectacular opening grossing an estimated $70.2M in its first weekendin theaters. Infiltrating 3,660 locations, the PG-13 film averaged a muscular$19,175 per venue and beat out the $52.5M bow of its predecessorThe Bourne Supremacyby a healthy 34%. That action entry launched in July 2004 and went on to gross$176.1M. The new entry was also directed byPaul Greengrassand co-starred JuliaStiles and Joan Allen.The eye-popping debut set a new benchmark for the month of August edging outprevious record-holder Rush Hour 2 which bowed to $67.4M in 2001. That franchise’s next installmentRush Hour 3 plans toexact revenge when it opens this Friday gunning for the number one spot.Ultimatum also generated the second largest opening weekend in studio historyfor Universal trailing onlyThe LostWorld which collected $72.1M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of itsholiday debut in May 1997 during what was then the biggest opening weekend ofall time.Matt Damon proved onceagain how popular and relevant his Jason Bourne character is to today’saudiences. Ultimatum also earned the best reviews of any action picture thisyear so even though it was the summer’s eleventh sequel and fifth threequel, thefilm still played out as an event picture for movie fans. The opening was evenbigger than any debut in the James Bond or Mission: Impossible franchises.Openings for last year’s newest chapters for those spy sagas were $47.7M for Mission:Impossible III in May and $40.8M for November’sCasino Royale.If the estimate holds for The Bourne Ultimatum, it will become the fourth filmin five weeks to open north of $70M following Transformers,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and The Simpsons Movie.The string of big hits set the July box office ablaze and has now spilled overinto the final month of summer which should continue the fireworks. Plus mostfilms have been holding up well over the last few weeks. Of the 37 holdovercases in the top ten during the last five weekends, only four have witnesseddeclines of more than 50%. By comparison, nine had such drops over the samefive-week period a year ago.Last weekend’s top film The Simpsons Moviewas the only pic in the top ten to take a big tumble dropping 65% in itssophomore weekend to finish in second place with an estimated $25.6M. That gavethe Fox blockbuster a robust total of $128.6M in only ten days of release. The$75M production might find its way to the neighborhood of $190M domestically.Overseas, Comic Book Guy and pals grossed another $47.3M shooting theinternational total to $187M from 75 territories for a sensational global grossof $315.5M and counting.Disney launched its canine pic Underdog in thirdplace with a respectable opening of $12M, according to estimates, from 3,013theaters. The PG-rated family film averaged a decent $3,986 per venue and triedto take advantage of a marketplace lacking choices for younger kids.Adam Sandler’slatest comedy INow Pronounce You Chuck and Larry dropped 45% in its third weekend to anestimated $10.5M for Universal. The musical Hairspray, also inits third frame, dipped 41% to an estimated $9.3M for New Line. Totals to datestand at $91.7M and $79.1M, respectively.The megablockbuster Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix grossed an estimated $9.3M,off 48%, boosting the total to $260.8M. That puts the fifth Hogwarts tale atnumber 37 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters after 2004’s The Incredibleswhich banked $261.4M. Overseas, Phoenix posted an estimated $25.2M tolift the international tally to a towering $509.7M. With a worldwide gross of$771M, the latest wizard flick is now the third biggest global blockbuster of2007 after Pirates ofthe Caribbean: At World’s End ($952M) and Spider-Man 3($889M).The CatherineZeta-Jones drama No Reservationsfollowed in seventh place with an estimated $6.6M in its sophomore session. Downa reasonable 44%, the Warner Bros. release has cooked up $24.2M in ten days andlooks headed for a respectable $45M final.With a one-way ticket to the triple-century club, Transformerstook in an estimated $6M, down 49%, to lift its stellar cume to $296.3M. TheMichael Bay smash nowsits at number 26 on the all-time domestic list afterPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl which grossed $305.4Min 2003.For the second straight weekend, a pair of flops aimed at teens opened in thenumber nine and ten spots with averages of less than $3,000.

The Picturehouse release about the life of Salsapioneer Hector Lavoe earned lackluster reviews from critics. Receiving betternotices was the period drama Becoming Janewhich bowed in only 100 theaters to an estimated $1M for a strong $10,100average. Starring AnneHathaway as Jane Austen, the Miramax title expands to more markets in theweeks ahead.Four films fell from the top ten over the weekend. The animated comedy Ratatouille fromDisney and Pixar dropped by 46% in its sixth frame to an estimated $4M boostingthe cume to $188.3M. Though loved by critics, the rodent picture has not beenliving up to Pixar standards and should end its domestic run right around the$200M mark making it the company’s lowest-grossing hit since 1998’s A Bug’s Lifewhich took in $162.8M.Fox’s action sequelLive Free orDie Hard shot up an estimated $2.2M, tumbling 61%, and put its total at$130.2M. A domestic final of about $135M seems likely while the pic’s globalgross of $309M will continue to climb rapidly over the course of the summer.Also suffering sharp declines were the sophomores I Know WhoKilled Me and Who’s Your Caddy?which collected $1.2M and $1.1M, respectively. Lindsay Lohan’s latest box officeunderachiever crumbled 67% and has taken in just $6.2M in ten days with apathetic $8M final likely.

Warner Bros. counters the testosterone effects pic with its teen girl story \"Nancy Drew\" while The Weinstein Co. mixes the formulas by opening its all-female action flick \"DOA: Dead or Alive.\"Marvel super heroes look to top the charts for the third time this year with the new \"Fantastic Four\" film which reunites the main cast members of the first pic. That comic book actioner opened to a sturdy $56.1M in July 2005 and went on to gross $154.7M domestically and over $330M worldwide. Though panned by critics, it got the franchise going and Fox hopes to keep the cash registers ringing this summer. The studio aims to follow the same pattern it saw for its other Marvel ensemble series. 2000’s \"X-Men\" debuted to $54.5M and reached a $157.3M final with the 2003 and 2006 followups each grossing more and more.But \"Silver Surfer\" is different from \"X2: X-Men United\" which bowed to $85.6M. That mutant sequel earned strong reviews, followed a predecessor that was well-received, and opened at the beginning of May when there was no competition. The current sequel fatigue that has been hitting the box office could prevent \"Four\" from expanding beyond its core base. The studio gets credit for building the marketing campaign around the Silver Surfer character so it feels like it is offering something new. The milder PG rating could allow it to reach a broader audience, but many parents may not even notice as the ads make it look like all the other PG-13 comic pics. Cruising into over 3,800 theaters, \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" could take in around $53M this weekend.\"FF 2: ROTSS\"\"Nancy Drew\" hits the big screen with the teen sleuth from the popular mystery books moving to California to find herself in the middle of an unsolved case. The PG-rated film should see most of its business from the under-18 female set however since the property has been around for so long, it could bring in some older folks too. With Unfabulous star Emma Roberts as the title character, the Warner Bros. release offers little starpower beyond its core demographic. The studio will have to rely on the brand name and the current lack of films exciting girls. The turnout could be similar to what Warners saw two years ago in June 2005 with \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" which bowed to $9.8M over three days and $13.6M over its five-day launch. Opening in 2,612 theaters, \"Nancy Drew\" might debut with around $12M.\"Nancy Drew\"The videogame-inspired action film \"DOA: Dead or Alive\" gets a quiet release in 505 theaters on Friday. A babes-in-bikinis fight flick, the Weinstein Co. release is not being pushed too feverishly and will have little chance of drawing in business against the more high-profile action films out there now. With no major stars, the much-delayed PG-13 film might find itself with $1M or less this weekend.\"DOA: Dead Or Alive\"\"Ocean’s Thirteen\" was met with the smallest jackpot ever won by the franchise last weekend. \"Ocean’s Twelve\" fell by 53% in its second weekend in December 2004. The new installment should also see a steep drop given that it is the third time around and people are not exactly loving the pic. Warner Bros. could suffer a 55% decline and collect about $16M for a ten-day cume of $67M.\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" has been dropping by more than 50% each weekend and with the new \"Fantastic Four\" sequel arriving, this frame should be no different. Look for sales to get sliced in half and dip to about $11M pushing the domestic cume to $272M.A 30% drop could be in the works for \"Knocked Up\" which will not face much competition for adults. Look for a $14M weekend giving the Universal comedy $90M in 17 days.LAST YEAR: The Disney/Pixar collaboration \"Cars\" held onto the top spot for a second weekend with $33.7M for a reasonable drop of 44%. The Jack Black comedy \"Nacho Libre\" led the newcomers with an opening of $28.3M on its way to $80.2M for Paramount. \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" followed in third with a $24M bow while \"The Lake House\" debuted in fourth with $13.6M. Final grosses reached $62.5M for Universal’s racing sequel and $52.3M for the Warner Bros. romance. Jennifer Aniston‘s \"The Break-Up\" ranked fifth with $9.8M in its third frame.

The Fox release collected an estimated $71.9M in its first weekend in theaters and averaged a spectacular $18,320 per site from 3,922 locations. The PG-13 comedy enjoyed the third largest debut ever for an animated film trailing only Shrek the Third and Shrek 2 which bowed to $121.6M and $108M, respectively.The Simpsons Movie delivered the fifth biggest July opening weekend ever after the megasequels Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest ($135.6M in 2006), Spider-Man 2 ($88.2M in 2004), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ($77.1M in 2007), and Austin Powers in Goldmember ($76.6M in 2002). It also ranks fifth among the biggest non-sequel opening weekends in history following Spider-Man ($114.8M in 2002), Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone ($90.3M in 2001), The Passion of the Christ ($83.8M in 2004), and The Da Vinci Code ($77.1M in 2006). The magic number five is also where The Simpsons Movie stands in Fox’s company history behind the debuts of the last two installments in both the Star Wars and X-Men franchises.After building up an enormous fan base over the last 18 years, The Simpsons Movie was finally ready to capitalize on the popularity of the television series by jumping to the big screen and the audience certainly followed. Fox reported that the audience for the $75M production was solid in all four quadrants. Strong reviews from critics also helped the cause and probably encouraged many fans who have given up on watching the weekly series to return for the theatrical fun. The studio’s marketing department also deserves a gold medal for its unorthodox campaign which really commanded the attention of the public. From the contest between different towns named Springfield to host the premiere to the conversion of a dozen 7-11 stores into Kwik-E-Marts, the studio was able to generate massive amounts of excitement with creative new ideas.Dropping a notch from its top spot debut, Adam Sandler and Kevin James cuddled up in second place with the comedy I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry which fell 44% to an estimated $19.1M. The Sony release has laughed up a solid $71.6M in its first ten days and should find its way to the neighborhood of $125M. Chuck is performing much like Sandler’s 2002 summer comedy Mr. Deeds which bowed in late June to $37.2M, tallied $73.6M in ten days, and finished with $126.3M.Another former number one followed. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix dropped 48% to an estimated $17.1M in its third weekend and boosted its 19-day cume to $241.8M. Phoenix posted the smallest third-weekend gross of any Potter film to date, however a final domestic cume close to the $290M of the last installment Goblet of Fire still seems possible.The hot musical Hairspray posted a decent hold in its second weekend dropping 43% to an estimated $15.6M for New Line. The ensemble pic featuring John Travolta and Queen Latifah watched its total soar to $59.3M after only ten days which already makes it the studio’s top grossing film in two years. The PG-rated entry looks to pass the $103.3M of last winter’s Dreamgirls and may reach about $110M.Catherine Zeta-Jones headlined the new romantic dramedy No Reservations and found moderate success with an estimated opening of $11.8M. The Warner Bros. release debuted in 2,425 locations as an alternative choice for adult women and averaged a good $4,849. Aaron Eckhart and Abigail Breslin co-star in the story of a chef whose life changes after her sister’s death leaves the woman to care for her niece. Reviews were mixed.The action smash Transformers placed sixth in its fourth weekend with an estimated $11.5M. Down 44%, the Paramount/DreamWorks co-production boosted its cume to $284.6M putting it at number 31 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters after The Matrix Reloaded which grossed $281.5M in 2003. Transformers is now the third biggest hit ever for Paramount after Titanic ($600.8M) and Forrest Gump ($329.7M) and also the third largest in DreamWorks history trailing the last two Shrek installments.In their fifth weekends, Disney’s Ratatouille and Fox’s Live Free or Die Hard held up well grossing estimates of $7.2M and $5.4M, respectively. The Pixar toon dipped 34% and has banked $179.7M to date while the Bruce Willis sequel slipped only 25% pushing the cume to $125.1M. The new John McClane adventure is the actor’s highest grossing live-action film since 1999’s The Sixth Sense.Two new flops rounded out the top ten. Sony’s Lindsay Lohan horror flick I Know Who Killed Me bowed to an estimated $3.4M from 1,320 theaters for a weak $2,576 average. The R-rated torture pic was never tracking well and its star’s recent arrests put the nail in the coffin for the film’s release. MGM opened the golf comedy Who’s Your Caddy? with an estimated $2.9M averaging only $2,846 from 1,019 sites.Four films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. The Warner Bros. romantic comedy License to Wed tumbled 64% to an estimated $1.3M lifting its cume to $41.7M. A mediocre $44M final should result for the Robin Williams pic. Rival comedy Knocked Up has been one of the year’s top comedy performers and fell 48% to an estimated $1.2M giving Universal a superb $145.1M to date. The low-cost $30M production should finish its domestic run with just under $150M.Horror hit 1408 dropped 54% to an estimated $1.2M giving MGM $70M thus far. As the year’s second biggest fright flick after Disturbia, the John Cusack film should reach about $73M.The Steve Carell epic comedy Evan Almighty grossed an estimated $1.1M, down 57%, pushing the tally to $96.3M. Produced for $175M, the PG-rated pic will have to work hard with second-run business in order to crack the $100M mark for Universal. It will also have to soar internationally and on video if it wants reach break-even.A handful of films expanded into wider release this weekend. MGM’s military drama Rescue Dawn grossed an estimated $1.7M from 500 locations for a $3,304 average and $3M cume. The sci-fi thriller Sunshine grossed an estimated $1.3M for Fox Searchlight resulting in a $2,750 average and a total of $1.6M. The Don Cheadle film Talk To Me averaged $6,986 from 115 playdates for a weekend estimate of $803,000. Total sits at $1.9M for Focus.The top ten films grossed an estimated $165.7M which was up a potent 52% from last year when Miami Vice opened at number one with $25.7M; and up 58% from 2005 when Wedding Crashers rose to the top spot for the first time with $20M in its third frame.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"streaming, elm, Arts, show, psycho, Reality","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Simpsons-Movie-Gobbles-Up-72M-Opening"},{"id":"47509154224191","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Mighty \"Shrek\" Returns To Claim Crown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Mighty \"Shrek\" Returns To Claim Crownby Gitesh Pandya | May 17, 2007 |  CommentsAttacking theaters on the same May 18 date as the original ogre toon from six years ago, \"Shrek the Third\" stomps into the marketplace this weekend ready to seize the box office crown.No other studio dared to challenge this mid-May event film which has much of the scene all to itself. Add in the third weekend of \"Spider-Man 3\" and multiplexes will surely be active with ticket sales ready to surge from last weekend’s levels.Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and Antonio Banderas all return to lend their voices to \"Third\" and are joined by old and new faces like John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Eric Idle, Rupert Everett, and Justin Timberlake. In the new PG-rated film, the not-so-jolly green giant embarks on a quest to find himself a replacement to become the heir to the throne of Far Far Away and finds all sorts of comedic misadventures along the way.The first two \"Shrek\" pics also opened on the weekend before the lucrative Memorial Day holiday frame and went on to show terrific legs. \"Shrek 2\" bowed on a Wednesday and grossed a whopping $108M over its three-day period on its way to becoming the number three domestic blockbuster of all-time with $436.7M. It was so well-loved and interest in a new chapter began almost immediately with moviegoers of all ages. With its blend of colorful and zany antics for kids plus sophisticated humor for adults, the franchise has been able to stomp on all its animated competitors to become king of the toons. In fact the next biggest openings in history for animated films are claimed by \"The Incredibles,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" and \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" which all launched in the $68-71M range.In the much-talked-about ‘Battle of the Threes’ this month, each tentpole is trying to outdo the previous one and is slipping itself into theaters a couple of hours earlier each time. \"Spider-Man 3\" launched like most blockbusters do with Thursday night midnight shows, but \"Shrek the Third\" is offering its night-before showtimess at 10pm while next week \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" will take it one step further on the plank by starting its first showings at 8pm on Thursday evening. Though uncommon, the practice has been seen before. Night-before showtimes for previous summer tentpoles included 10pm for 2003’s \"The Matrix Reloaded,\" 10pm for 1997’s \"The Lost World,\" and even 6pm for 1996’s \"Independence Day\" which practically gave it a whole new opening day.With 4,122 theaters this weekend, \"Shrek\" should be able to dominate the marketplace with ease especially since the only real threat, \"Spider-Man 3,\" is fading fast and summer movie fans are looking for something else to eat popcorn in front of. Competition should actually be less for \"Third\" than for its predecessor. The second chapter faced $53.8M from the rest of the top ten on its debut frame. This weekend, even with higher ticket prices, that figure will be hard to reach since most of the top ten will consist of feeble grosses. That gives \"Third\" a nice environment to enter, even if trailers and commercials are not as funny this time around.Reviews have been weaker than last time and repeat business over the long-term should not be as strong for Paramount which hardly has its name anywhere on the new product. Its subsidiary DreamWorks still has its brand name everywhere on the film. Regardless, the marketing has been as powerful as ever with McDonalds coming on board as a promotional partner after years of being in bed with Disney exclusively. Comedies do so well at the box office and business should come from the family audience as well as from teens and young adults looking for fun weekend entertainment. Hoping to set a new benchmark for animated openings, \"Shrek the Third\" could haul in about $115M from Thursday night through Sunday.Will the \"Third\" time charm?Peter Parker busted onto the scene with a record-shattering opening weekend two weeks ago, but gravity has kicked in since. The second weekend drop of 62% showed that the film absorbed much of its potential upfront and that repeat business isn’t really a factor. This week, Monday sales were only $3.6M (down 65% from last Monday) while Tuesday stood at $3.5M (off 57%). With \"Shrek\" stepping in to steal away all the attention, \"Spider-Man 3\" is sure to suffer another large decline. Some multiplexes will open up those fifth and sixth Spidey screens and turn them into ogre auditoriums. Still, as the studio knew a year ago when tentpole release dates were set, a silver medal is guaranteed this weekend. \"Spider-Man 3\" may fall by more than 50% to about $27M and boost its 17-day cume to an impressive $280M.Sophomores \"28 Weeks Later\" and \"Georgia Rule\" will get bumped down a notch this weekend. Like for all horror sequels, a second weekend drop of less than 50% would be shocking for the Fox zombie pic. A 55% tumble for \"Weeks\" would put it at $5M pushing the ten-day tally to a modest $18M. Universal’s multi-generational dramedy is playing to older women who do not exactly rush out on opening weekend so a smaller decline will result. \"Georgia Rule\" could dip by 40% to around $4M giving the Jane Fonda flop only $13M in ten days.LAST YEAR: Sony shot to the top of the charts with the global launch of \"The Da Vinci Code\" which seized control of the number one spot with a massive $77.1M bow. The Tom Hanks smash went on to gross $217.5M domestically and a colossal $753M worldwide. Paramount debuted its DreamWorks toon \"Over the Hedge\" in the runnerup spot with $38.5M and went on to collect $155M from North America and $330M globally. Rounding out the top five were \"Mission: Impossible III\" with $11.3M, \"Poseidon\" with $9.2M, and \"RV\" with $5M. Lionsgate offered horror audiences \"See No Evil\" and was met with $4.6M on its way to a weak $15M total.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"El, rotten, comiccon, TV, Dates, political","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Mighty-Shrek-Returns-To-Claim-Crown"},{"id":"47509154227264","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Spidey Rules, Fonda Flops","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Spidey Rules, Fonda Flopsby Gitesh Pandya | May 13, 2007 |  CommentsPeter Parker suffered a massive sophomore slide, but \"Spider-Man 3\" still dominated the box office around the globe spending a second weekend at number one with no other film coming anywhere near its stellar numbers.Among the frame’s four new releases, the zombie thriller \"28 Weeks Later\" fared best with a decent bow in the runnerup spot while the Jane Fonda–Lindsay Lohan pic \"Georgia Rule\" was mostly ignored and opened with disastrous results. Two other new comedies \"Delta Farce\" and \"The Ex\" barely registered a blip on the radar.Sony was still crushing its competitors this weekend with \"Spider-Man 3\" which tumbled 60% to an estimated $60M in its second try in theaters. After ten days, the PG-13 hit has amassed a stunning $242.1M from North America and is still running ahead of its two predecessors. Ten-day cumes for 2002’s \"Spider-Man\" and 2004’s \"Spider-Man 2\" were $223M and $225M, respectively. However the new Venom installment is eroding faster as is often the case with the third part of a franchise. After the first three days, \"Spider-Man 3\" was an impressive 32% ahead of the first webslinger pic which opened on the exact same weekend in 2002. After seven days the lead was cut to 20% and now after ten days the gap has been reduced to 9%.For the weekend, \"Spider-Man 3\" accounted for a stellar 64% of the box office for the top ten and grossed $17.1M on Friday (down 72% from its record-shattering opening day last week), $25M on Saturday (down 51% from last Saturday), and is projected to gross $18M on Sunday (down 55% from a week ago). The 60% second weekend drop is not uncommon for high-profile tentpole sequels with mammoth debuts. Some other sophomore drops include 53% for \"X2: X-Men United,\" 54% for \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest,\" 63% for \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" and 67% for \"X-Men: The Last Stand.\"Where is part 3 headed in the long run? It would make sense to look at other action films that kicked off the summer movie season on the first weekend of May. The shares of the total cume collected in the first ten days were 64% for last year’s \"Mission: Impossible III,\" 69% for 2003’s \"X2,\" and 71% for 2004’s \"Van Helsing.\" Based on its trajectory and the competitive road ahead, \"Spider-Man 3\" could be headed for a finish of about $340-360M domestically. That would make it the lowest-grossing Spidey film in North America, however the overseas markets are a different story.\"Spider-Man 3\" grossed an estimated $85.4M internationally this weekend to boost its overseas haul up to a mammoth $379.6M for a colossal global gross of $622M. Next weekend, the Sandman entry will surpass the international takes of $418M and $410M for the first two Spider-Man flicks to become the top performer of the franchise outside of North America. With the \"Spider-Man\" fan base already maxed out domestically, Sony made a strategic move to grow the brand around the world by hosting several star-studded international red carpet premieres and opening the film in most countries days ahead of the United States leading to a substantial increase in moviegoer excitement in all markets. \"Spider-Man 3\" still stands a very good chance of becoming the biggest grossing film of the trilogy on a global scale with the North American shortfall being overshadowed by gains overseas. With a reported production budget of $258M, the super hero film should surpass the $900M mark worldwide this summer.Flesh-eating zombies took control of second place this weekend as the horror sequel \"28 Weeks Later\" opened with an estimated $10M representing a solid, but somewhat weaker-than-expected debut. The R-rated gorefest averaged a decent $4,342 from 2,303 playdates and delivered a gross almost equal to the $10.1M that \"28 Days Later\" achieved in its opening frame in June 2003. That sleeper hit bowed in a thousand fewer locations with 1,260 theaters and scored a more potent $7,986 average. Adjust for four years of ticket price increases and \"Weeks\" generated an opening weekend average half that of \"Days.\" The new chapter earned very high praise from most critics, but being the fourteenth horror film of 2007 probably hurt its cause as many genre fans have overdosed on frightfests. If the estimate holds (Fox estimated a rather slim 26% Saturday-to-Sunday drop), \"Weeks\" will become the first non-Spidey film to reach double digits on opening weekend since \"Fracture\" from mid-April.The star-driven chick flick \"Georgia Rule\" was dead on arrival at the box office debuting to an estimated $5.9M from 2,523 theaters for a flimsy $2,330 average. The R-rated film stars Lindsay Lohan as a rebellious teen left with her no-nonsense grandmother (Jane Fonda) for the summer. Felicity Huffman plays the alcoholic middle mom in the family. \"Georgia\" played more to the Fonda crowd than to the Lohan audience. Studio research from Universal showed that a whopping 81% of the turnout was female, 79% was white, and 70% was over the age of 30.\"Georgia Rule\" imploded at the box office since it repelled its two main consumer groups. Older women pay attention to reviews and critics were brutal in reviewing the dramedy. And younger teen girls who track Lohan obsessively couldn’t get in thanks to the harsh R rating. The opening was less than half the amount that the studio saw earlier this year when it targeted the same audience with the same number of theaters with the Diane Keaton–Mandy Moore pic \"Becasue I Said So\" which bowed to $13.1M over Super Bowl weekend. The Fonda flick was released over the Mother’s Day frame, but most daughters chose to give their moms the gift of not seeing \"Georgia Rule.\"Paramount’s hit teen thriller \"Disturbia\" enjoyed the best legs in the top ten dipping only 18% to an estimated $4.8M. Although in its fifth weekend, the Shia LaBeouf hit has the second largest theater count of any film and is playing in 3,106 locations that are still holding onto the durable thriller. Cume to date is $66.3M.The military comedy \"Delta Farce\" bombed in its opening weekend grossing only $3.5M, according to estimates, landing in fifth place. The PG-13 pic averaged a dismal $1,813 from 1,931 locations for Lionsgate. Reviews were understandably pitiful.New Line’s Anthony Hopkins–Ryan Gosling drama \"Fracture\" dipped only 22% to an estimated $2.9M in its fourth frame and upped its cume to $31M. The horror flick \"The Invisible\" dropped to seventh with an estimated $2.2M, down 33%, for a $15.5M total.Sliding only 25% in its third round was the action-comedy \"Hot Fuzz\" with an estimated $1.7M for Focus putting the sum at $18.9M. Nicolas Cage followed with his sci-fi flop \"Next\" which took in an estimated $1.6M, down 45%, for a total of $14.6M. Rounding out the top ten with an estimated $1.6M as well was the Disney animated hit \"Meet the Robinsons\" which fell 39% for a sturdy $94.1M cume. The 3D comedy will enjoy its status as the year’s top-grossing toon for just one more week since \"Shrek the Third,\" which opens on Friday, could march past it after only one weekend in theaters.Debuting with miserable results outside of the top ten was the Zach Braff–Amanda Peet comedy \"The Ex\" which opened to an estimated $1.3M from 1,009 locations for a pathetic $1,288 average. The PG-13 date flick was released by MGM and earned poor reviews. With \"The Ex,\" Hollywood has now seen a disturbing twelve wide releases over the last eight weeks fail to open to at least $5M. Numerous movies with little to offer paying moviegoers are being slaughtered in an overcrowded marketplace.Three star-driven vehicles dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Will Ferrell’s blockbuster comedy \"Blades of Glory\" grossed an estimated $1.4M in its seventh lap and boosted its cume to $113.8M. Off 41%, the $60M-plus DreamWorks/Paramount pic looks to skate to a $116-118M finish. Ice Cube’s comedy sequel \"Are We Done Yet?\" fell 46% to an estimated $950,000 giving Sony $47.4M to date. The family film looks to end with just under $50M putting it 40% behind its predecessor \"Are We There Yet?\" which pulled in $82.3M two years ago. Warner Bros. has collected a measly $5M in ten days for its Eric Bana–Drew Barrymore poker pic \"Lucky You\" and will probably fold with an embarrassing $7M.Arthouse darling \"Waitress\" starring Keri Russell expanded successfully in its second weekend serving up an estimated $636,000 from 65 sites for a solid $9,788 average. Fox Searchlight widened the acclaimed film from just four locations last weekend and pushed its cume to $788,000. A special Mother’s Day gift bag promotion across the country is expected to strengthen Sunday sales. This Friday, the comedy expands in its existing markets adding 57 theaters and on May 25 it will widen to 400-500 total theaters nationwide for the Memorial Day holiday weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $94.1M which was up 16% from last year when \"Mission: Impossible III\" stayed at number one with $25M; and up a scant 3% from 2005 when \"Monster-in-Law\" debuted on top with just $23.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"ITV, Arts, cats, thriller","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Spidey-Rules-Fonda-Flops"},{"id":"47509154208826","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Lucky \"13\" Hopes for Full Houses","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Lucky \"13\" Hopes for Full Housesby Gitesh Pandya | June 7, 2007 |  CommentsThe stars come marching out to do battle with the pirates for the number one spot this weekend.For the sixth consecutive weekend, a threequel is poised to command the top spot at the North American box office as Warner Bros. rolls out the caper pic \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" reuniting Hollywood’s fun boys. Sony counters with the family offering \"Surf’s Up\" while Lionsgate goes after the horror crowd with \"Hostel Part II.\" Each film should target its own audience so there should be space for all newcomers.George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and their endless list of co-stars are back again as everyone’s favorite criminals in \"Ocean’s Thirteen.\" The PG-13 pic finds the group back in Las Vegas on a heist driven by revenge against a real estate mogul, played by Al Pacino, who is launching his latest luxury hotel/casino. The first two in the series had December openings of $38.1M for 2001’s \"Ocean’s Eleven\" and $39.2M for 2004’s \"Ocean’s Twelve.\" They also had little direct competition for adults. Although they opened in the same fashion, the sequel was not as well-liked and found its way to $125.5M, or about one-third less than the $183.4M cume of the original which itself was a remake.\"Thirteen\" should play to the exact same audience of mature adults. Appeal is equally strong for males and females and even some teen interest should be there. Reviews have been generally positive but that should have little impact. Moviegoers know exactly what they are getting the third time around and will decide based on if they want to take another two-hour trip seeing slick actors, with slick hair, and slick clothes, acting cool. Those soured by \"Twelve\" may take a pass on \"Thirteen.\" Plus \"Pirates\" and \"Knocked Up\" will provide some solid competition. But the sheer amount of starpower should make this entry hard to resist to many looking for a fun mature film without pirates, super heroes, and endless special effects. \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" rolls the dice in 3,565 locations this weekend and might win about $37M over three days.Nerds!For those kids who can’t get enough of talking cartoon penguins, Sony unleashes its big summer animation entry \"Surf’s Up.\" Delivered in a mockumentary style, the PG-rated film tells the story of penguins that compete in a surfing competition, and of course crack jokes along the way. Arriving just three weeks after \"Shrek the Third,\" \"Surf’s Up\" will have to deal with competition from the ogre toon and to some extent the other aging threequels which combined should gross north of $40M this weekend. The new penguin pic does not have the buzz or the starpower of a Robin Williams that helped \"Happy Feet\" shoot to number one last November with a $41.5M bow on its way to a terrific $198M.Instead, \"Surf’s Up\" seems to be in the same middle category with recent films like \"Open Season\" and \"Meet the Robinsons\" which opened to $23.6M and $25.1M, respectively. With children in the process of ending their school years and starting their summer vacations, parents should be in the mood to take them to the movies for some non-violent fun. \"Surf’s Up\" lands in over 3,000 theaters on Friday and could debut with about $24M.\"Surf’s Up,\" aka \"March of the Happy Feet.\"Yet another horror sequel makes its way into theaters with Lionsgate’s \"Hostel Part II.\" The first \"Hostel\" was a number one hit last year opening to $19.6M on its way to an impressive $47.3M off of a tiny budget. The new R-rated entry finds three American students in Rome who find themselves caught in a grisly game of torture and mayhem. Horror fans have been suffering from fright fatigue lately. The recent sequels \"The Hills Have Eyes II\" and \"28 Weeks Later\" both opened to just under $10M failing to match the bows of their predecessors. Other horror flicks like \"Bug,\" \"The Condemned,\" \"The Reaping,\" and \"Vacancy\" all underperformed over the last several weeks and have helped to scare fans away from the genre.But Lionsgate is among the best at selling this type of fare to older teens and young adults and the distributor is hoping to tap into a built-in audience. Just as with the first one, Quentin Tarantino whores his name out again with a ‘presents’ credit on the marketing materials. It would be interesting to know what kind of compensation, monetary or otherwise, he gets for these transactions. Locking up ticket buyers in 2,350 theaters, \"Hostel Part II\" may open with around $12M.\"Hostel: Part II,\" sure to warm the hearts of all.Following its two frames at number one, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" should give up the top spot this weekend, although the runnerup slot is not necessarily a guarantee. The pricey Disney adventure fell by 62% last weekend and could see its drop dip to 50% this time. That would give Johnny Depp and his buddies about $22M for the session and $254M overall.Last weekend’s number two flick \"Knocked Up\" raced past \"At World’s End\" to claim the number one spot on Monday and Tuesday thanks to great buzz and is prepared to see a solid hold this time around. Two summers ago, the R-rated comedies \"Wedding Crashers\" and \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" both dipped by only 24% in their sophomore frames thanks to stellar word-of-mouth and no major competition from new releases. \"Knocked Up\" has the same great satisfaction from moviegoers, but will see much of its adult audience get tempted away by Brad and company. A 30% drop would still give it a great hold with about $21M for the frame. That would push the cume to a stunning $68M in only ten days.\"Shrek the Third\" will face direct competition from rival toon \"Surf’s Up\" this weekend. That could lead to a 40% decline to roughly $17M boosting the cume to $282M.LAST YEAR: Disney and Pixar joined forces for the number one opening of \"Cars\" which cruised into the top spot with $60.1M. The animated comedy raced to $244.1M domestically becoming the summer’s biggest non-Captain Jack flick, and over $462M worldwide. Universal’s comedy \"The Break-Up\" fell 48% in its second date grossing $20.3M and was followed by \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" with $16.1M. The horror remake \"The Omen\" bowed to $16M over the weekend and a creepy $36.3M over six days since its Tuesday launch on 6/6/06. Fox scared up $54.6M eventually. \"The Da Vinci Code\" rounded out the top five with $10.4M in its fourth lap. Debuting to solid results in a moderate launch was \"A Prairie Home Companion\" with $4.6M from 760 locations for a $6,008 average. The Picturehouse release found its way to $20.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"to, on, TV, thriller, New","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Lucky-13-Hopes-for-Full-Houses"},{"id":"47509155654727","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Vacancy\" Hopes for Full Occupancy","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Vacancy\" Hopes for Full Occupancyby Gitesh Pandya | April 19, 2007 |  CommentsAnother week, another horror film. That’s the mantra in Hollywood at the moment. Among the four new films going into wide release this weekend are Sony’s terror tale \"Vacancy\" which represents the fourth scary flick in three weeks to hit the multiplexes.Also debuting are New Line’s murder drama \"Fracture,\" the Warner Bros. romantic drama \"In the Land of Women,\" and the British action comedy \"Hot Fuzz\" all looking to help moviegoers kill some time as they await the return of the webslinger.Sony offers a new batch of frights in its latest horror pic \"Vacancy\" starring Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale as a couple stranded at a dirty motel where occupants are filmed while being brutally killed. The studio is making the right move by selling the R-rated film on concept first, and starpower second. The marketing has been creepy and effective plus the plot is different and appealing. Horror fans are likely to take interest. But moviegoers have been bombarded with scary movies so much in recent weeks that you’d think it was October. Plus the harsh rating will keep out some of the younger teens who may want in on this action. Also a wildcard will be this week’s massacre at Virginia Tech as college students may not be in the mood at this moment for a movie about senseless killings.Most of the business will depend on marketing and the campaign has been solid. It is very difficult nowadays to set your horror flick apart from all the other ones but \"Vacancy\" has done it right. Competition from \"Disturbia\" will be a factor, but older teens and young adults who like a good scare should line up in decent spring-like numbers. \"Vacancy\" opens in 2,551 theaters on Friday and could pull in around $14M over three days.Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson are forced to snoop in \"Vacancy.\"Recent Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling plays an assistant district attorney prosecuting a man who murdered his wife, played by Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins, in the new courtroom thriller \"Fracture.\" The New Line release will play to a mature adult audience which puts it in a strong position given all the films targeting teens and young adults at the moment. Both actors are well-respected, however they are not necessarily box office powers. Hopkins has done well when he’s playing a cannibal, but otherwise his track record is spotty when anchoring a film with no other major commercial draws. Reviews have been somewhat positive which could help a tad. \"Fracture\" debuts in about 2,400 theaters and may collect roughly $12M over the frame.Ryan Gosling wishes there was a time limit in \"Fracture.\"Warner Bros. goes after the ladies with the weekend’s only PG-13 entry \"In the Land of Women.\" Written and directed by actor-turned-filmmaker Jonathan Kasdan, the romantic drama stars \"The O.C.\"’s Adam Brody along with Meg Ryan and Olympia Dukakis in the story of a young man who learns the complexities of the other sex while caring for his ailing granny. Male appeal will be close to zero. That means that \"Disturbia,\" which is playing very well with teenage girls, will be a major competitor here. Aside from that, there aren’t too many direct threats however the overall marketing push has not been very loud on \"Women.\" Landing in 2,155 theaters, \"In the Land of Women\" might capture about $8M for the weekend.An Adam Brody sandwich, courtesy of \"In the Land of Women.\"The creative team behind 2004’s cult hit \"Shaun of the Dead\" is back with its take on cop buddy flicks with \"Hot Fuzz.\" The R-rated action comedy finds an overachieving London cop being transferred to a seemingly peaceful countryside village before stumbling upon a series of mysterious killings. Young men will make up the core audience. But through video and cable, \"Shaun\" has built up a loyal fan following which is likely to give this new entry a try. Add in positive buzz from its blockbuster release in the U.K. earlier this year (it’s already grossed $48M outside of North America) plus glowing reviews from U.S. critics and it is sure to pack a punch in the per-theater average race. Holding it back will be the moderate wide release in 825 locations. In 2004, \"Shaun\" debuted in 607 sites and grossed $3.3M for a solid $5,487 average. \"Hot Fuzz\" should be hotter and could arrest about $6M this weekend.The dandy \"Shaun of the Dead\" gang is back in \"Hot Fuzz.\"Following its surprisingly potent number one opening, Shia LaBeouf‘s thriller \"Disturbia\" will face some hefty competition from \"Vacancy\" which also goes after those seeking a scary flick. A 45% drop could be in order giving the Paramount title around $12M for the frame and a ten-day tally of $39M.Will Ferrell‘s hit comedy \"Blades of Glory\" looks set to break through the $100M mark this weekend. A 35% decline would give the Paramount release about $9M for the frame and $102M after 24 days. Disney’s animated film \"Meet the Robinsons\" has been holding up very well and with another weekend of mostly R-rated new entries, look for another slim dip. The 3D toon might slide by just 25% to roughly $9M boosting the cume to $84M. An invitation to the century club is in the mail.LAST YEAR: Spooky flick \"Silent Hill\" topped the charts opening to a strong $20.2M on its way to $47M for Sony. The Weinstein Company’s spoof hit \"Scary Movie 4\" tumbled 58% in its second weekend to $16.8M for the runnerup spot. Debuting in third was the Michael Douglas actioner \"The Sentinel\" with $14.4M before finishing with $36.3M for Fox. The studio’s toon sequel \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" followed with $13.3M in its fourth frame while competing animated entry \"The Wild\" rounded out the top five with $8.3M.

It was mostly a sluggish frame at the North American box office as the top ten slumped to its third worst level of 2007.The courtroom thriller \"Fracture\" and the action-comedy \"Hot Fuzz\" both opened to respectable results while the horror pic \"Vacancy\" and the drama \"In the Land of Women\" generated little excitement.Shia LaBeouf enjoyed his first back-to-back stint in the top spot with the suspense hit \"Disturbia\" which held up well in its sophomore frame grossing an estimated $13.5M. Off only 39%, the Paramount release of a DreamWorks production averaged a solid $4,464 from 3,015 sites. Teen-oriented thrillers typically fall by more than 50% on the second session. Produced for a mere $23M, \"Disturbia\" has grossed an impressive $40.7M in its first ten days and could be headed for a $65-70M finish.Leading the weekend’s crop of new movies was the murder thriller \"Fracture\" as ticket buyers spent an estimated $11.2M watching Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling go at it. The R-rated film from New Line averaged a solid $4,574 per theater from 2,443 sites. Reviews were mostly good which helped since the film skewed to a mature adult audience.Will Ferrell scored the third $100M blockbuster of his career, and second in nine months, with \"Blades of Glory\" which ranked third in its fourth weekend with an estimated $7.8M. Down 44%, the Paramount title is still the widest release in the marketplace with 3,459 locations and the cume has hit $101.1M. The comedy star’s other trips to the century club in a lead role were with 2003’s \"Elf\" ($173.4M) and last summer’s \"Talladega Nights\" ($148M).Opening weaker than expected in the fourth slot was the horror entry \"Vacancy\" with only $7.6M, according to estimates. The R-rated pic about a couple stranded in a motel where videotaped killings take place averaged a mild $2,979 from 2,551 playdates. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale star in the Sony release. Fright fatigue may have hurt \"Vacancy\"’s opening as the $19M-budgeted film was the fourth scary flick this month to be aimed at moviegoers. Young adults made up most of the audience as studio research showed that 66% of the crowd was under the age of 25 and 52% was female. \"Disturbia\"’s better-than-expected hold also made an impact.Disney followed in fifth with the animated hit \"Meet the Robinsons\" which grossed an estimated $7.1M in its fourth frame, down 43%, for a total of $82.2M.Shooting up the best average among all wide releases in the marketplace was the new British action-comedy \"Hot Fuzz\" which premiered to an estimated $5.8M from 825 theaters for a potent $7,075 per venue. The R-rated buddy cop flick from the creative team behind 2004’s cult hit \"Shaun of the Dead\" earned glowing reviews and tapped into a built-in audience of fans. \"Fuzz\" outgunned \"Shaun\" in all ways beating the latter’s September 2004 bow which delivered $3.3M from 607 theaters for a $5,487 average. Produced for $16M, \"Hot Fuzz\" has already grossed an impressive $48.5M overseas including $41M from the United Kingdom.The Ice Cube comedy sequel \"Are We Done Yet?\" dropped two spots to seventh with an estimated $5.2M in its third weekend. Sony’s family pic fell 42% and raised its sum to $39.6M.Close behind in eighth was the new chick flick \"In the Land of Women\" which opened poorly with an estimated $4.9M from 2,155 theaters. Averaging a weak $2,281 per location, the PG-13 film stars Adam Brody as a young man who meets a houseful of women when caring for his sick grandmother. \"Women\" was the fifth wide opener of the past two weeks to fail to reach a $3,000 average in its debut frame.Rounding out the top ten were two films that that have been showing how differently starpower can affect the box office. The Halle Berry–Bruce Willis thriller \"Perfect Stranger\" collapsed in its second weekend and tumbled 63% to an estimated $4.1M. With only $18.1M locked up in ten days, Sony should find its way to roughly $25M followed by a quick trip to DVD. On the other hand, Buena Vista’s blockbuster comedy \"Wild Hogs\" starring Tim Allen and John Travolta remained in the top ten for the eighth consecutive weekend with an estimated $2.9M, off 39%, boosting the cume to $156.2M. It is the highest-grossing non-Spartan film of the year.Four films fell out of the top ten this weekend. The year’s biggest smash \"300\" dropped 49% to an estimated $2.3M in its seventh adventure and lifted its staggering domestic total to $204.7M. Budgeted at only $60M, the stylish war epic should end its North American run with an amazing $207-210M. That would amount to nearly three times its opening weekend gross which is rare these days for effects-driven action films that debut with monster bows. \"300\"’s legs have been strong overseas too where it has tallied $216.8M for a mammoth global gross of $421M and counting.Other R-rated films suffered horrendous drops as they tumbled out of the top ten. Losing two-thirds of its audience was Fox’s adventure \"Pathfinder\" which grossed an estimated $1.7M in its second weekend. The Viking pic has collected a puny $8M in ten days and looks headed for a wimpy $10M finish. Maybe casting some Spartans would have helped.Hilary Swank’s horrorfest \"The Reaping\" grossed an estimated $1.6M, down 65%, boosting the mild cume to $22.7M. The $53M double feature \"Grindhouse\" crashed 68% in its third try and took in an estimated $1.4M putting its 17-day take at $22.7M as well. Both films should end up in the $25M vicinity.Miramax expanded its Richard Gere drama \"The Hoax\" from 413 to 1,069 theaters but saw weekend sales slip 11% to an estimated $1.3M. The average was diluted down to a poor $1,216 as the cume inched up to only $5.1M.In limited release, Paramount Vantage widened its Molly Shannon pic \"Year of the Dog\" from seven to 33 sites and grossed an estimated $139,000 for a $4,200 average. Cume sits at $280,000 with more cities being added this Friday. Fox Searchlight’s \"The Namesake\" collected an estimated $765,000 from 327 locations in its seventh weekend averaging $2,339 for a cume of $9.8M to date.The top ten films grossed an estimated $70.1M which was down an unsettling 26% from last year when \"Silent Hill\" opened at number one with $20.2M; and off 10% from 2005 when \"The Interpreter\" debuted on top with $22.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"history, Prime, romantic, Netflix, John","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-New-Films-No-Match-For-Scary-Shia"},{"id":"47509155657801","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Perfect Stranger\" Heads A Crowded Field","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Perfect Stranger\" Heads A Crowded Fieldby RT Staff | April 12, 2007 |  CommentsThis weekend Hollywood just doesn’t know its limits. Six new releases will jam into an already crowded marketplace on Friday trying to connect with spring moviegoers.That makes for a whopping 20 new films over a four-week ultracompetitive period. This weekend’s ticket buyers will not have enough time or money to see them all, especially in a relatively weak playing period like mid-April. Friday the 13th may indeed be a terrifying day for the accountants behind some of these freshman flicks.Call it \"Catwoman\" vs. \"Hudson Hawk.\" Sony unleashes its latest star-driven thriller \"Perfect Stranger\" which finds Halle Berry playing an investigative reporter following an ad mogul (Bruce Willis) who may have killed her friend. The R-rated pic boasts the most star wattage of any new film this weekend and that will mean something at the cash registers. The actor combo is unique, appealing, and diverse enough to bring in two different audiences which is always good for business. Poor reviews probably won’t mean too much to the box office. Sony’s marketing push has been commendable and with Spartans, Ninja Turtles, and figure skaters ruling the charts over the last five weeks, many moviegoers will be ready to shift over to this type of film. \"Perfect Stranger\" invades 2,661 theaters and stands a chance of hitting number one with around $15M.\"At least ‘Hudson Hawk’ didn’t make RT’s ‘Worst of the Worst’ list.\"Paramount counters with its own thriller this Friday the 13th with \"Disturbia.\" With a more teen-friendly PG-13 rating, the pic tells the tale of a young man under house arrest who suspects that his neighbor is a serial killer. Shia LaBeouf, Carrie-Anne Moss, and David Morse make up the cast so clearly the film is not being sold on its starpower. \"Perfect Stranger\" will provide some healthy competition as those looking for a scare, and are 17 or older, will find Berry and Willis worth paying money for. But young teens that have already skated with Will Ferrell may look here for their weekly escape to the movies. Entering about 2,500 theaters, \"Disturbia\" could scare up around $10M over the weekend.Yet another Shia LaBeouf movie.Rookie distributor Chicago Releasing drives into theaters with its maiden film \"Redline,\" an action drama about bored rich kids who drag race for fun. The PG-13 film is being aimed at teenage boys and young men with action-packed commercials and trailers full of hot cars and hotter babes. Eddie Griffin is the only major star in this vehicle so only those who really crave another \"Fast and the Furious\" flick will make it out. But in a weekend when most new films have been slapped with an R, this one could carve out a small audience of teens. Racing into about 2,000 theaters, \"Redline\" might finish with roughly $7M this weekend.No word yet how many expensive cars Eddie Griffin wrecks in \"Redline.\"With all the films thrown into theaters this year, nobody has offered up a handy dandy Viking flick. That changes this weekend with the action-adventure \"Pathfinder,\" an R-rated pic that looks at a young man’s battle against Norse invaders in North America centuries ago. Following the runaway success of \"300,\" it’s no surprise that Fox is marketing \"Pathfinder\" as a historical war epic based on a graphic novel. But this new film has nothing on Leonidas and pals. The Viking subject matter is not interesting, the marketing push has been weak, and lead actor Karl Urban is no commercial draw. Attacking 1,720 theaters, \"Pathfinder\" might find only $5M on opening weekend.Just one of many decapitations in \"Pathfinder.\"Lionsgate goes after an adult audience with its new crime drama \"Slow Burn\" which stars Ray Liotta, LL Cool J, and Taye Diggs. The R-rated film about a district attorney whose colleague gets tied up in a murder case will go out in a moderate wide release with only a mild marketing push behind it. The starpower is not strong enough to attract a sizable crowd and there is little buzz among movie fans. Opening in 1,163 locations, \"Slow Burn\" could die a quick death at the multiplexes with a $4M bow.\"Slow Burn\": Expected to experience a quick death.In a world overstuffed with animated films, First Look Pictures turns the tables and aims at adults with the R-rated toon \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters.\" Based on the animated series on Cartoon Network, the pic is trying to follow in the footsteps of \"Borat\" by taking a TV property with a cult following and making a long-titled feature film that pushes the envelope. Even the term ‘Movie Film’ seems taken from the Kazakh journalist. \"Aqua Teen\" scored some extra publicity with its marketing debacle in Boston several weeks ago, however that will not give the film more mainstream appeal. Only the die hard \"Aqua\" fans are likely to come out here. Competition is stiff this weekend and with the fewest theaters of the six pack of new flicks, this one could get left behind. Landing in over 800 locations, \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" may collect approximately $4M over three days.\"Only 23 more installments of $59.95 to go!\"After back to back wins atop the box office charts, \"Blades of Glory\" will face a fierce challenge this weekend from the new releases. Few have the starpower that the Will Ferrell comedy packs and last weekend’s strong hold suggests that crowds are being pleased. A 35% fall would give \"Blades\" $14M for the weekend and $89M in 17 days.\"Meet the Robinsons\" and \"Are We Done Yet?\" have no new competition for the family audience so respectable holds are likely here as well. A 35% drop would give the Disney toon about $11M for a 17-day tally of $70M while a 40% decline for the Ice Cube sequel would give Sony around $9M for the sophomore frame and $33M after 12 days.LAST YEAR Easter weekend saw the arrival of \"Scary Movie 4\" which commanded a powerful opening grossing $40.2M in its debut. It was the second largest opening in the spoof comedy series and went on to capture $90.7M for The Weinstein Co. The animated blockbuster \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" dropped to second place with a still-potent $20M in its third frame followed by the sports comedy \"The Benchwarmers\" with $9.9M. Disney saw a disappointing debut in fourth with the animated film \"The Wild\" which took in just $9.7M on its way to $37.4M. \"Take the Lead\" rounded out the top five with $6.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Heroines, motion, Awards, Tumblr, Song, Ice, crossover, ITV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Perfect-Stranger-Heads-A-Crowded-Field"},{"id":"47509155660874","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ferrell &amp; Heder Still America’s Favorite Couple","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ferrell &amp; Heder Still America's Favorite Coupleby RT Staff | April 8, 2007 |  CommentsWill Ferrell and Jon Heder skated to another gold medal victory over the Easter holiday as the comedy \"Blades of Glory\" remained atop the charts despite the arrival of a handful of new pictures. The Quentin Tarantino–Robert Rodriguez experiment \"Grindhouse\" opened well below expectations and finished with disappointing results in fourth place.Overall, moviegoers were in the mood for existing films as the top five holdovers all dipped by less than 33%. The top ten delivered more than $100M in ticket sales for the sixth consecutive frame giving the marketplace continued strength.Comedy was king of the box office once again as \"Blades of Glory\" grossed an estimated $23M in its second weekend slipping only 30%. The Paramount release has now laughed up an impressive $68.4M in just ten days and looks headed north of $120M. The gross was slightly bigger than the $22.1M sophomore weekend take of Ferrell’s last hit \"Talladega Nights\" which tumbled by a larger 53% in its second lap last summer. With no major comedy competition this month, \"Blades\" should continue to pull in healthy numbers in the weeks ahead.Also holding up well in its second weekend was Disney’s animated pic \"Meet the Robinsons\" with an estimated $17M, off 32%. Still attracting solid business from its 3D engagements, the G-rated toon has banked a solid $52.2M in its first ten days and is also hoping to join the century club.Leading the crop of new flicks was the Ice Cube comedy \"Are We Done Yet?\" with an estimated $15M for a third place finish. The Sony followup to the 2005 sleeper hit \"Are We There Yet?\" averaged a solid $5,214 from 2,877 sites and has grossed $19.1M since opening on Wednesday. \"Done\"’s extended five-day opening was similar to \"There\"’s three-day bow of $18.6M from January 2005. That film went on to collect $82.3M and still stands as Cube’s top-grossing picture ever. Like the first one, the PG-rated Done played primarily to a family audience.The weekend’s big shocker was the violent two-for-one pic \"Grindhouse\" which debuted in fourth place with an estimate of only $11.6M. The three-hour-plus homage to the B movies of the 1970s averaged a decent $4,417 from 2,624 locations but did not come close to the opening weekend tallies of previous films from directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. The long running time for the $53M production forced theaters to offer fewer showtimes and a lack of female appeal may also have contributed to the less-than-stellar bow. Openings for other R-rated offerings from the maverick filmmakers include $29.1M for Rodriguez’s \"Sin City\" and $22.1M and $25.1M for Tarantino’s \"Kill Bill\" installments. Reviews for \"Grindhouse\" were very positive but The Weinstein Co. may not find much long-term success as most fans of the directors probably planned to see it sooner rather than later.Hillary Swank’s new horror flick \"The Reaping\" came in fifth place in its debut grossing an estimated $10.1M from 2,603 locations for a moderate $3,872 average. The R-rated tale of a scientist investigating supernatural occurances in a small Louisiana town launched on Thursday and scared up $12M over four days. \"The Reaping\" also took off in 16 international markets and grossed an estimated $7.1M overseas.The year’s biggest blockbuster \"300\" followed in sixth place with an estimated $8.8M in its fifth battle, down just 23%, lifting the overall domestic haul to $193.9M. Overseas, the Spartan smash pulled in another $32M over the weekend boosting the international total to $173M and the global gross to a stunning $367M. \"Wild Hogs,\" the second largest hit of 2007, dipped 21% to an estimated $6.8M giving Buena Vista a fantastic $145.5M to date.Dropping to eighth was Mark Wahlberg’s action pic Shooter with an estimated $5.8M, off 31%, for a cume of $36.7M. Falling 47% to an estimated $4.9M was the Warner Bros. toon \"TMNT\" which put its total at $46.7M thus far.Fox’s family drama \"Firehouse Dog\" opened in tenth place with dismal results grossing an estimated $4M from 2,860 theaters. Averaging a weak $1,399, the PG-rated film about a boy and his celebrity pooch bowed on Wednesday and collected $5.3M over five days. With so many other films courting the family crowd over Easter weekend, \"Dog\" was completely overlooked.The top ten films grossed an estimated $107.1M which was dead even with last year’s Easter frame when \"Scary Movie 4\" opened at number one with $40.2M; but up 23% from 2005’s holiday in March when \"Guess Who\" debuted on top with $20.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"critics, Classic, criterion, 93rd, cartoon, Music, and, dragons, on, vampires, best","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ferrell-Heder-Still-Americas-Favorite-Couple"},{"id":"47509155662923","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Grindhouse\" Prepares for Easter Carnage","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Grindhouse\" Prepares for Easter Carnageby Gitesh Pandya | April 5, 2007 |  CommentsEaster weekend sees four new wide releases hopping into the marketplace aiming to give the spring box office a boost.Action audiences get The Weinstein Company’s two-for-the-price-of-one special \"Grindhouse\" while horror fans go for a scare with the religious-themed fright flick \"The Reaping\" starring Hilary Swank which opens on Thursday. Wednesday saw two competing family films bow – the Ice Cube sequel \"Are We Done Yet?\" and the pooch pic \"Firehouse Dog.\" With Good Friday being a holiday for many, three-day numbers should reach healthy levels.Moviegoers with three hours to kill and a love of death and destruction will line up for \"Grindhouse,\" a double feature with separate films directed by indie heroes Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. The R-rated pic includes the former’s road actioner \"Death Proof\" starring Kurt Russell, Rosario Dawson and Rose McGowan while the latter’s zombie flick \"Planet Terror\" stars McGowan and Freddy Rodriguez. Clearly the primary business will come from the young male fan base that Tarantino and Rodriguez hold dearly. Since there is so much overlap here, the grosses may not grow beyond what they’ve seen with previous hits.\"Grindhouse\" has had some flashy marketing which is successfully generating interest. Plus there is starpower behind the cameras. Add in the two-for-one novelty item and the press tour that the cast and directors are on and it’s clear to see that a strong opening weekend will result. Debuts for similar ultraviolent R-rated films from the helmers include $22.1M for 2003’s \"Kill Bill Vol. 1,\" $25.1M for the folowing year’s \"Kill Bill Vol. 2,\" and $29.1M for 2005’s \"Sin City.\" But cutting into \"Grindhouse\"’s potential will be its length which will force each screen to offer one less showtime per day compared to conventional two-hour films. Reviews have been very positive so the pic may reach a little beyond its core crowd of fan boys. Entering 2,624 theaters on Friday, \"Grindhouse\" could deliver an opening weekend gross of around $25M.\"Grindhouse\"Following in the footsteps of Jim Carrey and Sandra Bullock from earlier this year, Hilary Swank gives it a go in the world of horror with the new religious-themed chiller \"The Reaping.\" The R-rated film finds the two-time Oscar winner playing a scientist called in to investigate mysterious occurances in a small Louisiana town where locals believe Biblical devastation is on its way. Horror flicks with religious storylines usually connect with audiences and with \"The Reaping\" timed for an Easter weekend launch, a sizable four-day start is likely. The thriller should skew a bit more female given the protagonist while age-wise, the appeal seems broader than just older teens and young adults.With the Thursday debut, Warner Bros. is looking to take advantage of the Good Friday holiday which will make Thursday night at the multiplexes seem like a Friday night. A Wednesday bow, which is common for this particular weekend, would have been more risky as bad word-of-mouth from opening day ticket buyers who return to work or school on Thursday would dampen weekend sales. Reviews have not been too pleasant, but the studio deserves credit for actually holding press screenings which nowadays is rare for a horror film. With \"Premonition\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" both fading away into the low single-digit millions this weekend, \"The Reaping\" is ready to cater to those in the market for a good scare. Warner Bros. attacks 2,501 theaters on Thursday and increases the run to 2,603 on Friday and could register an opening weekend of roughly $14M and $17M over four days.Hilary Swank in \"The Reaping.\"Rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube conquered the kiddie movie box office two years ago with the surprise hit \"Are We There Yet?\" which grossed $82.3M becoming the star’s biggest career hit. For the sequel \"Are We Done Yet?,\" Sony has replaced the road comedy element with a story about a family facing all kinds of obstacles fixing up their new house. There debuted to a solid $18.6M in January 2005 against almost no competition for family audiences. \"Done\" feels like the same dish served up again and has not really excited its target audience. Plus there is much more competition for it to deal with in the marketplace, notably Disney’s \"Meet the Robinsons\" which offers fresh new entertainment. Cube probably won’t see the same success the second time around but at least the grosses won’t tumble 82% the way they did when he took control of the \"XXX\" sequel. Now playing in 2,877 theaters, \"Are We Done Yet?\" could collect about $13M over three days and $16M over five days.Ice Cube in \"Are We Done Yet?\"Families not in the mood for some fun with Ice Cube get to try out the boy-and-his-dog drama \"Firehouse Dog\" from Fox. The PG-rated pic about a celebrity hound that gets lost and later rescued by a firefighting team lacks the starpower and marketing muscle needed to deliver a strong opening. Between \"Are We Done Yet?,\" \"Meet the Robinsons,\" and even \"TMNT,\" kids have enough choices this Easter weekend and will probably wait for \"Firehouse Dog\" on DVD. Bowing in 2,566 sites, the family film could open with about $7M over three days and $9M over five days.\"Firehouse Dog\"Among holdovers, the Will Ferrell comedy \"Blades of Glory\" looks to lose its spot at the top of the box office, but should still deliver a solid sophomore spin. The comedian’s summer hits \"Talladega Nights\" and \"Anchorman\" both dropped by more than 50% in their second weekends. \"Blades\" has the Good Friday holiday to help soften the blow a bit. A 45% decline would give Paramount about $18M for the frame and a solid $61M after ten days.Disney’s \"Meet the Robinsons\" also got off to a strong start last weekend, but will face stiff competition for families from both \"Are We Done Yet?\" and \"Firehouse Dog.\" The 3D toon could slide 35% to around $16M for a ten-day cume of nearly $50M. The ultraviolent war film \"300\" may fall by 45% to $6M and lift its impressive haul to $190M. The worldwide tally should blast past $350M this weekend.LAST YEAR: Still ranking number one with ease was the animated smash \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" with $33.8M despite losing half of its opening weekend sales. Debuting in second was the Rob Schneider sports comedy \"The Benchwarmers\" with $19.7M on its way to $57.7M for Sony. New Line’s dance pic \"Take the Lead\" opened in third with $12.1M before finishing off with $34.7M. The Denzel Washington–Jodie Foster actioner \"Inside Man\" followed with $9.1M in its third heist. Rounding out the top five was another action thriller \"Lucky Number Slevin\" with a $7M bow on its way to $22.5M for The Weinstein Co. The Fox Searchlight comedy \"Phat Girlz\" flopped in ninth with just $3.1M before getting yanked with only $7.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"kaiju, australia, Yoda, Disney, San, marvel, jones, deadpool, Superheroe, Black, Chernobyl, of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Grindhouse-Prepares-for-Easter-Carnage"},{"id":"47509155664972","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Will Ferrell Goes for the Gold","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Will Ferrell Goes for the Goldby Gitesh Pandya | March 29, 2007 |  CommentsTwo promising new comedies target different age groups and look to close off a red hot March box office with strong opening weekend sales.Paramount offers the Will Ferrell pic \"Blades of Glory\" while Disney goes after the kids with the animated flick \"Meet the Robinsons.\" Together, the pictures should help the marketplace surge and allow the top ten to cross the $100M mark for the fifth consecutive frame. The box office has not seen this kind of streak since last summer. Smaller films entering the multiplexes include the action pic \"The Lookout\" from Miramax and Universal’s uplifting drama \"Peaceful Warrior.\"Comedy king Will Ferrell skates into theaters everywhere looking for another gold medal with his newest laugher \"Blades of Glory.\" The PG-13 film finds the funnyman and Jon Heder playing rival figure skaters who must team up as a pair in order to compete again. Amy Poehler, Will Arnett, Jenna Fischer, and Craig T. Nelson co-star. \"Blades\" boasts the two main ingredients to a successful comedy hit – a bankable star and a unique concept. Add in the very funny commercials and trailers and Paramount is well-positioned to score its second number one hit of the year joining fellow star-driven comedy \"Norbit.\" Both pics were produced by DreamWorks.Ferrell left the competition in the dust last summer with \"Talladega Nights\" which bowed to a robust $47M on its way to a $148M final. \"Blades\" doesn’t have as big of a marketing push or the prime summer play period so its opening will not soar as high. But the former \"Saturday Night Live\" star will again prove that he is a reliable draw. The industry had some doubts in 2005 when both \"Bewitched\" and \"Kicking and Screaming\" failed to reach $65M. Ferrell’s 2004 hit \"Anchorman\" debuted to $28.4M and \"Blades\" should play out like that one, only bigger. Teens and young adults will be the driving force plus there is plenty of cross-gender appeal. Though the marketplace is crowded with many options, there aren’t too many direct threats. \"Wild Hogs,\" the only major comedy, is getting old as is \"300\" which most high school and college students have already seen. Spinning into over 3,000 theaters, \"Blades of Glory\" should finish in first place and win about $37M over the weekend.Ferrell and Heder in \"Blades of Glory.\"Disney uses its patented moves to go after the family audience with its latest animated offering \"Meet the Robinsons.\" With most digital toons these days being of the PG variety, \"Robinsons\" carries a G rating which it hopes will help convince parents to buy tickets for even the youngest of their children. The story follows an orphan boy who befriends a kind family and features the voices of Angela Bassett, Tom Selleck, and Adam West. In the cartoon world, films sell best when they are comedies and feature popular comedians in central roles. \"Robinsons\" at least has the first factor working for it.The marketing has been strong and trailers have been funny. But unlike the studio’s last film for kids, \"Bridge to Terabithia,\" this time competition will be a force. \"TMNT\" and \"The Last Mimzy\" will only be in their second weekends and are set to steal away about $20M worth of business from the same target audience. Luckily, the weekend’s two other new films will attract different segments of the moviegoing crowd. \"Meet the Robinsons\" does not have the firepower to reach the heights of Pixar pics. Rather, it may bring out the same size audience as last fall’s \"Open Season\" which bowed to $23.2M from an ultrawide 3,833 locations. \"Meet the Robinsons\" bows in roughly 3,200 sites but could exploit its studio’s brand name to deliver a similar gross of about $23M.Let’s \"Meet the Robinsons.\"Years after leaving the sitcom world of NBC’s \"3rd Rock From the Sun,\" Joseph Gordon-Levitt anchors the heist thriller \"The Lookout.\" The R-rated Miramax release comes from writer-turned-rookie-director Scott Frank and co-stars Jeff Daniels. Starpower is seriously lacking here and that will hurt its box office prospects. Reviews have been good, but the target audience of young adults have \"Blades of Glory,\" \"300,\" and \"Shooter\" to choose from and all of them offer more for the money. With only so much marketing and distribution strength behind it, the film will have a tough time just getting an invite to the top ten. \"The Lookout\" debuts in about 1,000 theaters on Friday and could collect about $4M over three days.Jeff Daniels and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in \"The Lookout.\"In an unorthodox approach, Universal will be releasing the inspirational drama \"Peaceful Warrior\" in 615 theaters this weekend but most moviegoers will actually be getting free tickets through a promotion with Best Buy. The PG-13 film starring Nick Nolte was given a limited release last summer and grossed more than $1M from just over 40 theaters. Universal will report box office grosses that include regular paid sales plus full ticket prices for each free admission. With $15M worth of free tickets allocated for opening weekend, it will be unlikely that the paid portion will make up a sizable amount. Film fans who visit the promotional web site can get up to ten complimentary tickets each. However, the studio should get some extra buzz that it could benefit from when the DVD is released a few months down the road.Nick Nolte and Scott Mechlowicz in \"Peaceful Warrior.\"The Ninja Turtles ruled the box office last weekend in \"TMNT,\" but will face a formidable foe in Disney’s \"Meet the Robinsons\" which will play to the same audience. A 40% drop would give the animated actioner $14M for the frame and $43M after ten days. Warner Bros has also been raking in the dough with its stylish war epic 300 which has been holding up surprisingly well. Another 40% fall will put the R-rated battle pic at $12M boosting the cume to $180M after 24 days. Mark Wahlberg‘s \"Shooter\" could decline by 45% to $8M giving Paramount a ten-day total of $27M.LAST YEAR: Smashing the March opening weekend record set four years earlier by its predecessor, \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" shot straight to number one with a colossal $68M debut. The Fox juggernaut went on to gross $195.3M domestically and a towering $657M worldwide giving the \"Ice Age\" duo over $1 billion in global grosses. Dropping to second was \"Inside Man\" with $15.4M. Warner Bros. launched its urban drama \"ATL\" in third with $11.6M on its way to $21.2M. Rounding out the top five were \"Failure to Launch\" with $6.5M and \"V for Vendetta\" with $6.3M. The horror flick \"Slither\" creeped into eighth place with a $3.9M opening leading to a $7.8M final. Sony claimed the year’s most notorious flop with \"Basic Instinct 2\" which bowed to $3.2M on its way to a pathetic $5.9M before sweeping the Razzie Awards.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"movies, cancelled, New, BBC, Super, remakes, 71st, TV, social, dc, Endgame, 2017, Rocky, marvel, song","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Will-Ferrell-Goes-for-the-Gold"},{"id":"47509155672144","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"300\" Prepares to Conquer Multiplexes","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"300\" Prepares to Conquer Multiplexesby Gitesh Pandya | March 8, 2007 |  CommentsFor the first time in nearly a month, North America’s most popular movie won’t be about motorcycles. Warner Bros. goes back in time 2,500 years for the epic war saga \"300\" which aims to conquer the box office with ease.Other studios have conceded the frame to the effects-driven actioner as the only other film opening wide is the family drama \"The Ultimate Gift\" which will cater to a non-violent crowd that prefers to keep decapitations to a minimum in their weekend entertainment.Two and a half years after running the historical epic genre into the ground with \"Alexander,\" Warner Bros. is back to breathe new life into the industry with \"300.\" The R-rated war film stars Gerard Butler as the Greek king who in 480 B.C. led his small battalion of brave soldiers in battle against the mighty Persian army. Directed by Zack Snyder (\"Dawn of the Dead\"), \"300\" is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and features stylized action sequences and a visual look unlike the endless line of epics that hit multiplexes a few years ago.Warner Bros. got the ball rolling early last fall with exciting trailers that really energized the target audience of male action fans who now will be very satisfied by the amount of blood, gore, and female nudity in the picture. Momentum has been building ever since and today, \"300\" is an event film for many. The film lacks a marquee star but that should not matter much. The unique look and feel should compensate for that as moviegoers will find the film to be worth paying top dollar for to see on the big screen. This is not one to wait for on DVD. And unlike other epics, this one keeps it just under two hours which will allow theaters to offer enough showtimes per day. The marketplace is ready for \"300.\" Aside from \"Ghost Rider\" which is going into its fourth lap, there will be little direct competition for \"300\" to face so King Leonidas and his men should prevail in this battle.Other effects-driven R-rated action films have found success recently in the spring months. In 2005, Keanu Reeves‘ \"Constantine\" bowed to $29.8M and \"Sin City\" opened to $29.1M while last March \"V for Vendetta\" debuted with $25.6M. All three films ended in the $70-76M range. \"300\" looks like it has the strength to go higher. The marketing has been brilliant, competition is weak, and excitement is high. Warner Bros. will score its first number one opener of the year with \"300\" which invades 3,103 theaters, including Imax venues which will add a few extra bucks. A Friday-to-Sunday gross of about $38M could result.\"300,\" finally in theaters.Fox Faith, the new wing of Twentieth Century Fox dedicated to films with uplifting religious themes, rolls out its family drama \"The Ultimate Gift\" starring James Garner, Brian Dennehy, and Abigail Breslin who comes straight from her high profile Oscar nomination for \"Little Miss Sunshine.\" Based on the best-selling book, the PG-rated film tells the story of a young man who instead of getting his expected inheritance after the death of his wealthy grandfather, is given a series of challenges to help him build character and learn what is truly important in life. Grassroots marketing is being used to court the faith-based audience and a dollar from every ticket sold will be donated to one of a number of different charities. Still, the film is not being given a marketing blitz so large numbers are not expected. Opening in over 800 theaters, \"The Ultimate Gift\" may gross about $3M this weekend.\"The Ultimate Gift,\" with Abigail Breslin.After opening almost everywhere else in the world, the hit Korean horror film \"The Host\" makes its ways to American shores through Magnolia Pictures this weekend. The R-rated creature feature debuts in about 70 theaters and has been garnering impressive reviews since its premiere last May at the Cannes Film Festival. Fox Searchlight platforms its family saga \"The Namesake\" from director Mira Nair (\"Monsoon Wedding,\" \"Vanity Fair\") in six theaters in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Toronto. Starring Kal Penn, the PG-13 film about the struggles of an Indian-American family will expand weekly throughout the rest of the month.\"The Namesake\"After three weeks of motorcycle flicks ruling the box office, a stylized trip back in time with \"300\" will come as a welcome change of pace. \"Wild Hogs,\" which powered its way to a surprisingly potent $39.7M bow last weekend, will drop out of pole position. With little direct competition, look for a reasonable dip in sales. The Buena Vista release has been a crowdpleaser and will remain the top choice for moviegoers in the mood for a laugh or anything with big Hollywood stars. A 35% decline could result giving \"Hogs\" a weekend tally of around $26M and a ten-day cume of $74M.Paramount’s serial killer pic \"Zodiac\" got off to a moderate start last weekend and will have another R-rated film aimed at adults to deal with. A drop of 40% may occur putting the murder mystery at $8M for a total of only $25M after ten days. Sony’s \"Ghost Rider\" will become the first member of the 2007 century club and should fall 45% to $6M for a $103M cume. The Nicolas Cage pic is set to take a serious hit thanks to 300.LAST YEAR: The Matthew McConaughey–Sarah Jessica Parker romantic comedy \"Failure to Launch\" debuted at number one leading a new crop of films with $24.4M. The Paramount release found its way to $88.7M. Opening in second place was the Tim Allen kidpic \"The Shaggy Dog\" with $16.3M followed closely by the new horror flick \"The Hills Have Eyes\" with $15.7M. Final grosses reached $61.1M and $41.8M, respectively. The Bruce Willis actioner \"16 Blocks\" dropped to fourth with $7.4M. After two weeks at the top of the charts, the Tyler Perry comedy \"Madea’s Family Reunion\" tumbled from first to fifth with $5.7M.Source: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"casting, mutant, Movies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-300-Prepares-to-Conquer-Multiplexes"},{"id":"47509155675218","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Ghost Rides\" High Again at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Ghost Rides\" High Again at #1by Gitesh Pandya | February 26, 2007 |  CommentsAcademy Award winner Nicolas Cage ruled Oscar weekend with his skull-on-fire motorcycle actioner \"Ghost Rider,\" which held steady at number one in North America for the second straight time. Moviegoers delivered different verdicts to the handful of new releases led by the Jim Carrey thriller \"The Number 23,\" which fared best and debuted in second place. Overall, the top ten was about even with the corresponding weekends from the last two years.Dropping 57% from its powerful opening weekend, \"Ghost Rider\" took in an estimated $19.7M over the weekend and pushed its ten-day tally to a sensational $78.7M. The big-budget Sony actioner adapted from the popular Marvel comic book series suffered a decline similar to that of 2003’s \"Daredevil,\" which sank 55% in its second frame after an explosive bow over Presidents’ Day weekend. That super hero flick captured 68% of its domestic total in the first ten days. \"Ghost Rider\" is so far following the same path which means a final gross of $115-120M seems likely.Comedy guru Jim Carrey took a stab at horror with his new psychological thriller \"The Number 23\" and saw moderate results with a $15.1M launch, according to estimates. Playing in 2,759 theaters, the R-rated film averaged $5,476 per location for New Line. Critics were brutal to the scary pic, but the opening fared better than those of most of Carrey’s previous non-comedies.Disney’s \"Bridge to Terabithia\" dropped 40% in its sophomore adventure and pulled in an estimated $13.6M in ticket sales. The PG-rated fantasy has banked an impressive $46.2M in ten days and may be heading for around $75M overall.Fox saw a not-so-arresting debut for its cop comedy \"Reno 911!: Miami,\" which opened in fourth place with an estimated $10.4M. The R-rated feature adapted from the moderately successful Comedy Central series averaged a mild $3,849 from a wide release in 2,702 theaters. By comparison, openings for other recent R-rated comedies based on popular television properties include $26.5M for \"Borat\" and $29M for \"Jackass: Number Two,\" both of which bowed at number one.Eddie Murphy‘s comedy \"Norbit\" dropped 42% to an estimated $9.7M in its third weekend raising its total to $74.7M for Paramount. Warner Bros. followed with its own comedy \"Music and Lyrics,\" which pulled in an estimated $8M in its sophomore weekend. Down a reasonable 41%, the Hugh Grant–Drew Barrymore pic has taken in $32.1M in 12 days and could be headed for the $50M mark.Universal’s \"Breach\" dipped 41% in its second weekend to an estimated $6.2M. With $20.5M in ten days, the FBI thriller in on course for a $35M total. The Tyler Perry comedy \"Daddy’s Little Girls\" lost half of its audience in the second weekend just like the director’s last two February comedies. The Lionsgate release grossed an estimated $5.3M, down 53%, and has taken in $25.6M. Both \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\" and \"Madea’s Family Reunion\" made about 75% of their total grosses in the first ten days so a $35M final for Girls seems likely.A pair of new releases rounded out the top ten. Warner Bros. saw a dismal opening for its Billy Bob Thornton drama \"The Astronaut Farmer,\" which grossed an estimated $4.5M from 2,155 locations. Averaging a poor $2,093 per theater, the PG-rated film earned mixed reviews from critics.Goldwyn’s historical slave trade drama \"Amazing Grace\" enjoyed a solid bow with an estimated $4.3M from only 791 sites for a respectable $5,442 average matching \"Ghost Rider’s\" per-theater average to the dollar. Reviews were mostly favorable.Four films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. The runaway smash \"Night at the Museum\" collected an estimated $2.2M in its tenth weekend and upped its total to $241.7M putting it at number 44 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters ahead of \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" which made $241.4M in 2002. \"Museum\" fell 41% this weekend and should go on to reach around $246M domestically and over $500M worldwide.Universal’s Diane Keaton comedy \"Because I Said So\" grossed an estimated $2.9M, down 44%, putting its cume at a decent $38.4M. A final gross of $43-45M seems likely. Sony’s thriller \"The Messengers\" grossed an estimated $1.6M, tumbling 58%, for a $33.4M cume. The $16M production should conclude with a healthy $35M. MGM’s \"Hannibal Rising\" has grossed about $26M to date and should end its run with only $30M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $96.7M which was up 1% from last year when \"Madea’s Family Reunion\" opened at number one with $30M; but off 2% from 2005 when \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\" debuted on top with $21.9M.Source: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"football, TV, indiana, crossover, Hulu, BBC, It, Amazon, Superheroes, Travel, Annual, shows","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ghost-Rides-High-Again-at-1"},{"id":"47509155674193","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Ride with Wild Hogs at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Ride with Wild Hogs at #1by Gitesh Pandya | March 5, 2007 |  CommentsMoviegoers rallied behind the star-driven comedy \"Wild Hogs,\" which raced to number one at the North American box office, zooming past all expectations from Disney. Meanwhile, Viacom saw less-than-stellar debuts from its serial killer drama \"Zodiac\" from Paramount Pictures and the southern fried saga \"Black Snake Moan\" from arthouse unit Paramount Vantage. Overall, the box office remained healthy and surged well ahead of last year’s performance.Buena Vista powered its way to an estimated $38M in opening weekend sales for its road comedy \"Wild Hogs,\" delivering the largest March debut in history for a live-action film. The PG-13 pic starring Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy as four middle-aged men on a motorcycle adventure averaged a stellar $11,561 from 3,287 theaters. It was the year’s second biggest opening after \"Ghost Rider‘s\" $45.4M bow two weeks ago. According to studio research, 54% of the audience was actually female. Travolta’s everlasting sex appeal, Allen’s pull with moms thanks to his many Disney flicks, and the cast’s appearance on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" last week probably contributed to the solid turnout by women. The stars also allowed the film to tap into different audience segments.\"Wild Hogs\" posted the best opening ever in March for a non-animated film and the third biggest overall. The only movies to debut better in this month were the \"Ice Age\" flicks of 2002 and 2006. It also gave Travolta the biggest opening by far of his career, beating the $23.5M of 2005’s \"Be Cool,\" and the second best bow for Allen after the $57.4M bow of 1999’s \"Toy Story 2.\" As expected, \"Hogs\" was slammed by critics but reviews are practically irrelevant for a star-driven comedy like this. This is a crowdpleaser, not a criticpleaser. Audiences make their decisions based on if they think they will get a good laugh or not and Buena Vista’s marketing push was indeed solid. Though the overall weekend gross was strong, what was even more encouraging was the significant Friday-to-Saturday boost of 49% which is rare for any new release. A journey into nine-digit territory seems likely.Debuting far back in second place was the serial killer pic \"Zodiac,\" with an estimated $13.1M from 2,362 sites. Averaging a respectable $5,546 per theater, the R-rated film from director David Fincher played to an older audience as two-thirds of the crowd was over the age of 25, according to studio research from Paramount. Males and females were evenly represented. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., and Mark Ruffalo, \"Zodiac\" follows the investigation behind one of California’s most notorious murderers from the 1960s and 70s. The $65M film fared better than last fall’s murder mysteries set in the Golden State, \"The Black Dahlia\" and \"Hollywoodland,\" which debuted to $10M and $5.9M respectively.Reviews were overwhelmingly positive for \"Zodiac,\" but its 160-minute length may have cut into its grossing potential. Plus when factoring in ticket prices increases over the years, it can be estimated that \"Zodiac\" sold the fewest opening weekend tickets of any of Fincher’s films. Admissions were roughly the same as for \"Fight Club,\" which bowed to $11M in 1999. The studio is hoping that good word-of-mouth can carry the film in the weeks ahead.After leading the pack for two full weeks, the Johnny Blaze flick \"Ghost Rider\" fell to third but only dropped 43% for an estimated $11.5M gross. Sony’s Nicolas Cage starrer has taken in $94.8M in 17 days and should become the first new release of 2007 to break the $100M barrier. Disney’s \"Bridge to Terabithia\" also held up well dipping 39% in its third adventure to an estimated $8.6M. Cume stands at $57.9M.Jim Carrey‘s thriller \"The Number 23\" fell from second to fifth place in its sophomore scare and collected an estimated $7.1M. Down an understandable 52%, the New Line title has taken in a semi-decent $24.7M in ten days and looks headed for a $35-38M finish.Eddie Murphy‘s latest comedy \"Norbit\" enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten and dipped 34% to an estimated $6.4M for a $83M sum. Fellow laugher \"Music and Lyrics\" dropped just 36% to an estimated $4.9M giving the Hugh Grant–Drew Barrymore pic $38.7M to date.Paramount Vantage bowed its Samuel L. Jackson–Christina Ricci drama \"Black Snake Moan\" and collected an estimated $4M from 1,252 theaters. Averaging a mild $3,208, the debut was half the size of writer/director Craig Brewer‘s last film \"Hustle &amp; Flow,\" which opened in July 2005 to $8M from 1,013 theaters on its way to $22.2M and an Oscar. Jackson has witnessed many of his headlining vehicles struggle at the box office including \"Freedomland,\" \"The Man,\" and even \"Snakes on a Plane,\" which despite hitting the top spot, grossed much less than expected given its media hype last summer.The Fox comedy \"Reno 911!: Miami\" tumbled 64% in its second weekend to an estimated $3.8M for a ninth place finish. The R-rated pic has grossed $16.4M in ten days and should conclude with roughly $20M. Rounding out the top ten was the FBI thriller \"Breach\" with an estimated $3.5M, off 42%, for a $25.4M total.Three smaller films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. The slave trade drama \"Amazing Grace\" dipped only 26% in its second weekend to an estimated $3M. With $8.2M in ten days, the Samuel Goldwyn/Roadside Attractions period pic may find its way to $15-18M. The Billy Bob Thornton flop \"The Astronaut Farmer\" grossed an estimated $2.2M, down 52%, and put its sum at an embarrassing $7.7M. Look for a $11M final.Lionsgate’s Tyler Perry comedy \"Daddy’s Little Girls\" fell 53% to an estimated $2.3M in its third frame and upped its cume to $28.4M. By comparison, the distributor saw stronger 17-day grosses of $44M and $55.7M respectively for the director’s last two films, \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\" and \"Madea’s Family Reunion.\" \"Daddy’s\" should end its run with $30-33M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $100.8M which was up a stunning 30% from last year when \"Madea\" stayed at number one with just $12.6M; but off 4% from 2005 when \"The Pacifier\" debuted on top with $30.6M.Source: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Dead, comedy, El, Reviews, 45, DGA","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Audiences-Ride-with-Wild-Hogs-at-1"},{"id":"47509157189723","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Epic\" Comedy Battles Oscar’s Finest","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Epic\" Comedy Battles Oscar's Finestby Gitesh Pandya | January 25, 2007 |  CommentsA quartet of poorly-titled films will hit the multiplexes on Friday hoping to grab some business opposite a string of acclaimed releases fresh from earning their Oscar nominations.Leading the newcomers with the most theaters is the spoof comedy \"Epic Movie\" which goes head to head against the crime drama \"Smokin’ Aces.\" Horror fans get the werewolf pic \"Blood and Chocolate\" while those who prefer non-violence get the Jennifer Garner drama \"Catch and Release.\"Fox tries to tap into the immature crowd with its new comedy \"Epic Movie\" which spoofs many of the big-budget action and fantasy blockbusters of recent years. The \"Scary Movie\" series has ushered in more spoof flicks and Fox even saw solid results a year ago with its \"Date Movie\" which lampooned popular romantic comedies. That film bowed to $19.1M and found its way to $48.5M. Fans may be getting a little sick of the same template over and over again so the opening may not be as big, but the genre still works especially with young teens looking for mindless entertainment after a long week of classes. Commercials and trailers do not look that funny, but given the weak marketplace and the success rate of comedies with specific concepts, \"Epic\" may take in all the cash it needs to hit the number one spot. Holdovers do not seem like they will break into double digit millions this weekend. With a wide release in 2,801 playdates, the PG-13 pic could amass around $14M.Lampooning Harry Potter in \"Epic Movie.\"The weekend’s solo R pic comes in the form of the mob thriller \"Smokin’ Aces\" from Universal. Jeremy Piven, Ben Affleck, Andy Garcia, and Alicia Keys star in this ensemble piece about a witness in protective custody being hunted down by a crime boss before he can testify. Young men are the target audience here in this Vegas-set flick that tries too hard to be cool. The NFL’s weekend off should make guys more available for ticketbuying which will help. The studio saw an underwhelming $6.4M three-day debut for another R-rated crime saga earlier this month – \"Alpha Dog\" – and will probably see many of the same customers this time around. An extra 1,000 theaters will ensure a bigger opening, but there is no A-list star or director in the film to truly attract a large crowd. A quick in and out of theaters should result. Opening in 2,204 locations, \"Smokin’ Aces\" might collect roughly $8M in its first hand.Alicia Keys in \"Smokin’ Aces.\"Jennifer Garner plays a woman trying to rebuild her life after the death of her husband in the new drama \"Catch and Release.\" Sony proudly offers the only major new pic for female moviegoers and hopes to stand out from the crowd by going after an audience few others are targeting. The PG-13 film will test the starpower of the former \"Alias\" star who last hit screens two years ago with the big-budget bomb \"Elektra.\" Her comedy \"13 Going on 30\" which she anchored solo performed well with a $21.1M bow, but \"Catch\" lacks the same fun factor and will probably draw fewer males too. Plus the studio is going into the marketplace with less than half the theaters they gave to \"13.\" A supporting role by Kevin Smith is not likely to help bring in many dudes. But with so few films playing specifically to young women, a decent average is likely. \"Catch and Release\" hits 1,622 theaters on Friday and could take in about $7M.Jennifer Garner, Kevin Smith, and some other dude in \"Catch and Release.\"Werewolf terror hits the multiplexes in the form of \"Blood and Chocolate,\" a new supernatural fright flick aiming for teens and young adults. The MGM release carries a PG-13 rating which could work well in getting in younger teens, but the film lacks the zing or interesting concept that fans need in order to pay top dollar at the local theater. Every recent horror film has underperformed at the box office and this one does not seem like the savior that can turn things around. Plus other new releases will be distracting the target audience too. Opening in roughly 1,500 theaters, \"Blood and Chocolate\" could debut to around $4M.\"Blood and Chocolate.\"After racking up over $200M through its five-week stay in the top two slots, \"Night at the Museum\" should get bumped down a bit. The Ben Stiller film once again faces no new competition for the family audience so a slim decline should result. A 30% fall would give Fox about $8M for the weekend and a towering cume of $215M. Sony’s \"Stomp the Yard\" looks to fall harder so a 40% drop to around $7M could occur pushing the cume to $50M.After scoring the most Oscar nominations of any film with eight, the big-budget musical \"Dreamgirls\" shot up to the number one spot on Tuesday after finishing in third last weekend and on Monday. Although it missed out on the top prize of a Best Picture nomination, the Jamie Foxx–Beyonce Knowles film is still getting media attention which is fueling the buzz and the studio has wasted no time in advertising the fact that no other film has more Academy Award nods. Still, the film is aging and many other awards contenders are expanding and trying to attract upscale moviegoers too. A small 20% slide to around $6M may occur giving \"Dreamgirls\" a solid $85M total.LAST YEAR: Martin Lawrence topped the box office with his hit comedy sequel \"Big Momma’s House 2\" which bowed to a plump $27.7M. The Fox release went on to gross $70.2M. Debuting in second was the family film \"Nanny McPhee\" with $14.5M for Universal on its way to $47.1M.

New releases were met with varying levels of success. Both the futuristic saga Children of Men and the high school drama Freedom Writers earned high marks while playing in moderate national play. However, the animated film Happily N’Ever After and the action-comedy Code Name: The Cleaner were both met with soft openings.Overall, the first weekend of 2007 was solid and holdovers displayed considerable strength as audiences continued to find time to see all the interesting films in the marketplace. A remarkable 14 movies collected weekend sales of $4M or more giving the box office great breadth.The Ben Stiller comedy Night at the Museum easily topped the charts over the weekend with an estimated $24M in its third weekend of play boosting its cume to a stellar $164.1M. Down only 35% from the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the New Year’s holiday frame, the Fox blockbuster matched the comedian’s hit Meet the Fockers from two years ago which also topped the charts over the same three weekends. With its lucrative start and impressive holding power, Museum should be able to zoom past the $200M mark domestically.Will Smith’s The Pursuit of Happyness also stayed put for the third straight weekend taking the number two spot again with an estimated $13M. The Sony hit enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten slipping only 33% and pushed its cume to $124.2M. Pursuit could be headed for $160M or more.Adult audiences responded to Alfonso Cuaron’s futuristic drama Children of Men which expanded nationally in its second weekend and took third place with an estimated $10.3M. The critically acclaimed Universal release averaged a sturdy $8,515 from 1,209 theaters and has collected $11.9M since its limited opening a week earlier.Hilary Swank saw impressive results for her school teacher drama Freedom Writers which debuted in fourth place with an estimated $9.7M from only 1,360 theaters. Averaging a strong $7,136 per location, the PG-13 film from Paramount and MTV Films connected with a young and multicultural audience. According to studio data, 62% of the audience was under the age of 21 and 50% were non-white. The road ahead for Freedom looks promising as the film scored an exceptionally high A grade from CinemaScore and 93% of those polled would definitely recommend it. Paramount will widen the picture on Friday into 700 more theaters for the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. school holiday weekend.The studio’s hit musical Dreamgirls followed in fifth place with an estimated $8.8M in its second full weekend of wide release, off 37%. The Jamie Foxx-Beyonce Knowles pic upped its total to $54.5M and continues to post the best average in the top ten with a stellar $10,358 from 852 sites. Paramount will add about 1,000 more theaters on Friday.Family audiences were not too charmed by the new animated offering Happily N’Ever After which opened in sixth place with just $6.8M, according to estimates. The PG-rated fairy tale satire averaged a lukewarm $2,856 from 2,381 locations for Lionsgate and could not compete with Night at the Museum which continued to dominate the family crowd.Competing kidpic Charlotte’s Web followed closely with an estimated $6.6M for Paramount, down 43%, pushing the cume to $67M. Universal’s CIA thriller The Good Shepherd ranked eighth with an estimated $6.5M, off 41%, for a mediocre $48.4M sum.Rocky Balboa punched up an estimated $6.3M for MGM dropping 41% and raised its cume to an impressive $60.9M. Rounding out the top ten was another sports drama, the football saga We Are Marshall, which fell 37% to an estimated $5.1M giving Warner Bros. an underwhelming $35.4M to date.Debuting poorly in eleventh place was the action-comedy Code Name: The Cleaner which bowed to an estimated $4.6M from 1,736 for a messy $2,650 average. The New Line release stars Cedric the Entertainer and Lucy Liu.Three films fell from the top ten but still generated weekend grosses of $4M or more. The fantasy adventure Eragon took in an estimated $4.6M, down 44%, for a $66.8M total to date. Tied with $4M a piece were the Cameron Diaz comedy The Holiday and the penguin toon Happy Feet. Sony’s holiday comedy fell 41% and upped its sum to $59M while the animated smash dropped 48% lifting its cume to $185.4M.Several arthouse films in limited release expanded over the weekend. Fox Searchlight’s Judi Dench pic Notes on a Scandal expanded from 22 to 93 theaters and grossed an estimated $1.1M for a potent $11,828 average. The film widens to over 200 sites on Friday and then into over 600 playdates on January 26. Cume is $2M. Paramount’s Perfume was not as successful in its expansion going from three to 280 sites grossing an estimated $551,000 for a weak $1,968 average. Total to date stands at $649,000.Warner Independent went from 37 to 72 theaters for its period drama The Painted Veil and grossed an estimated $480,000. Averaging a solid $6,667, the pic has taken in $1.2M to date and will expand to 200 runs on Friday. MGM’s Miss Potter continues to attract mediocre numbers grossing an estimated $123,000 from 26 playdates for a mild $4,731 average. Cume is $140,555 for the Renee Zellweger film.The top ten films grossed an estimated $97.2M which was off 1% from last year when Hostel opened at number one with $19.6M; and up 4% from 2005 when Meet the Fockers remained on top in its third weekend with $28.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Creative, DC, teaser","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Moviegoers-Line-Up-for-Museum-For-Third-Straight-Weekend"},{"id":"47509158688868","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Moviegoers Get Jiggy with \"Happyness\"","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Moviegoers Get Jiggy with \"Happyness\"by Gitesh Pandya | December 18, 2006 |  CommentsBox office heavyweight Will Smith scored his sixth consecutive number one opening this weekend with his new rags-to-riches drama \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" which raced past two new kid movies to claim the top spot.The mythical adventure \"Eragon\" opened well in second place while the family film \"Charlotte’s Web\" debuted in third with a modest launch. The one-two punch of \"Pursuit\" and \"Eragon\" kicked in a combined $50.5M and for only the second time in box office history, two December films opened to over $20M each on the same weekend.Proving once again how strong his pull is with moviegoing audiences, Smith conquered the charts with an estimated $27M bow for \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" which on Thursday picked up two Golden Globe nominations including one for Best Actor in the drama category. Averaging a stunning $9,467 per theater in 2,852 locations, the PG-13 film tells the real-life story of a San Francisco man and his young son who become homeless and must try to get back on their feet. The former fresh prince’s real son Jaden plays his on-screen son in the uplifting, feel-good story.With mixed reviews and no famous director or co-stars, \"Pursuit\" succeeded solely on the starpower of Smith and followed his last five films \"Hitch,\" \"Shark Tale,\" \"I, Robot,\" \"Bad Boys II,\" and \"Men in Black II.\" Those five hits all opened at number one and went on to gross a jaw-dropping combined haul of $1.7 billion worldwide. With such a strong start, Will Smith should easily be able to score the tenth $100M domestic blockbuster of his career.For Sony, \"Pursuit\" marked its record 13th number one opener of 2006 from a jam-packed slate of 27 releases. Sony also broke its own all-time studio box office record by crossing the $1.57 billion mark in domestic ticket sales with two full weeks still to go and three titles remaining in the top ten. The previous record was set by Sony in the \"Spider-Man\"-fueled year of 2002.Opening in second place with some strength of its own was the dragon tale \"Eragon\" with an estimated $23.5M. Playing in 3,020 sites, the PG-rated film averaged a stellar $7,765 per theater. Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Djimon Hounsou, and Rachel Weisz star in the mythical adventure which was based on a teen author’s story. Driven by special effects, \"Eragon\" carried a reported production cost of more than $100M. With no \"Lord of the Rings,\" \"Harry Potter,\" or \"Narnia\" films this holiday season, fantasy audiences had nothing else to rally behind and so Fox took advantage of the opportunity by placing its actioner into the pre-Christmas slot. With school kids leaving for their holiday breaks in the days ahead, the dragon pic aims to soar towards the land of nine digits.The only other time two December openers bowed to more than $20M each on the same frame was on this very weekend in 1997 when \"Titanic\" debuted at number one with $28.6M followed by the launch of the James Bond flick \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" with $25.1M. This weekend’s two new releases also helped to keep the overall box office within striking distance of last year’s colossal frame when \"King Kong\" ruled with a $50.1M opening and \"Narnia\" in its second weekend contributed a stellar $31.8M. Despite not having any film of the same magnitude, the marketplace this weekend had great breadth and saw the Top 20 dip only 7 percent versus last year.Paramount got off to a slow start with its big holiday season offering for families \"Charlotte’s Web\" which bowed to an estimated $12M from 3,566 theaters for a mild $3,372 average. Based on the popular children’s book, the G-rated film stars Dakota Fanning and features voices from Julia Roberts, Oprah Winfrey, and John Cleese. Studios never want to see an opening weekend average lower than its theater count, but Paramount is hoping that the upcoming school holidays will allow the well-reviewed film to have legs. Recent kidpics that the studio opened in mid-December went on to make six to seven times their opening weekend grosses. These include 2002’s \"The Wild Thornberrys\" with a $6M bow on its way to $39.9M and 2001’s \"Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius\" whch debuted to $13.8M and reached $80.9M. \"Web,\" which cost over $80M to produce, hopes to follow and capture the attention of parents and their smaller children in the days and weeks ahead when they have more available time.The penguin blockbuster \"Happy Feet\" followed with an estimated $8.5M, down just 34 percent, for a $149.4M sum. The Warner Bros. smash now ranks number eight among 2006 films and should climb into the top five after the holiday season. Sony’s Cameron Diaz–Kate Winslet comedy \"The Holiday\" dropped only 36 percent in its second weekend to an estimated $8.2M pushing its ten-day cume to $25.3M. Overseas grosses for the films rose to $59.7M and $28.5M, respectively.Last weekend’s number one film \"Apocalypto\" tumbled down to sixth place with an estimated $7.7M. Dropping 49 percent, the Mayan adventure has grabbed $27.9M for Buena Vista in ten days but also suffered the largest decline of any film in the top ten. Fellow sophomore \"Blood Diamond\" fared better in its second weekend sliding only 28percent to an estimated $6.3M. Earning its star Leonardo DiCaprio one of his two Golden Globe nominations this year for Best Actor – Drama, the Warner Bros. title has mined $18.4M in ten days. \"Blood Diamond\" got off to a slow start, but is now showing that it could have the legs to go the distance over the holiday season.The James Bond actioner \"Casino Royale\" grossed an estimated $5.7M, off 36 percent, to put its total at $137.6M for Sony. New Line’s Biblical drama \"The Nativity Story\" once again enjoyed the smallest drop in the top ten dipping a mere 18percent to an estimated $4.7M for a $23.1M cume. The family comedy \"Unaccompanied Minors\" followed in the ten spot with an estimated $3.7M, off 37percent, giving Warner Bros. a poor $10.2M to date.Opening to spectacular results, thanks in part to its $25 ticket price, was the big-budget musical \"Dreamgirls\" from DreamWorks and Paramount with an estimated $360,000 from only three theaters for an unprecedented $120,000 average. Winner of five Golden Globe nominations including Best Picture in the comedy/musical category, the PG-13 pic was given a special exclusive release in solo houses in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. For the extra cash, ticket buyers were given a Broadway-style experience with reserved seating and a limited-edition program book. At a more standard adult ticket price of $10, that would translate to an average of about $48,000 which is still phenomenal. The studios reported that all 21 shows over the weekend were sold out. Starring Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, \"Dreamgirls\" opens nationally on Christmas Day in over 800 theaters.Also platforming this weekend was the George Clooney starrer \"The Good German\" which opened to an estimated $79,000 from just five locations for a solid $15,800 average. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the R-rated film co-stars Cate Blanchett and Tobey Maguire and follows an American war reporter’s escapades in Germany.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Denzel Washington‘s action thriller \"Deja Vu\" fell 50 percent to an estimated $3M in its fourth assignment putting the total at $57.8M. Buena Vista should find its way to the neighborhood of $65M. Opening just five days after rival action pic \"Casino Royale\" has proven to be a major obstacle for \"Deja Vu\" which will end up with less than half the gross of the better-received Bond flick.Fox’s holiday comedy \"Deck the Halls\" has also faced stiff competition for its target audience. The Danny DeVito pic took in an estimated $2M this weekend, down 50 percent, for a $32.9M cume. A $40M final seems likely. Disney’s \"The Santa Clause 3\" dropped 43 percent to an estimated $1.9M giving the studio $79.8M thus far. Tim Allen and pals should reach the $85M mark, or about 40 percent below the $139.2M of \"Clause 2\" from four years ago.Elsewhere below the top ten, Golden Globe nominees for Best Picture posted good numbers. Fox’s \"Borat,\" nominated for both Picture and Best Actor in the comedy/musical category, slipped 39 percent to an estimated $1.6M for a $122.8M total to date. The raunchy comedy had fallen by more than 45 percent in each of the last two weekends. Miramax’s \"The Queen\" slipped only 22 percent to an estimated $685,000 for a $25.7M cume in its eleventh consecutive weekend in the Top 20. Fellow Best Picture nominee in the drama category \"Babel,\" which led all films with seven total Globe nominations, saw its weekend gross inch up 7 percent to an estimated $490,000 despite losing over one-third of its theaters. Paramount Vantage has taken in $18.3M so far and hopes that the nominations will allow the ensemble film to remain a relevant box office player through the holidays.The top ten films grossed an estimated $107.3M which was down 10 percent from last year when \"King Kong\" opened at number one with $50.1M; but up 13 percent from 2004 when \"Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events\" debuted in the top spot with $30.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"BBC, FOX, VICE, Country, HBO, toronto, rings, elevated","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Moviegoers-Get-Jiggy-with-Happyness"},{"id":"47509157182554","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Epic Movie\" Conquers Box Office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Epic Movie\" Conquers Box Officeby Gitesh Pandya | January 29, 2007 |  CommentsProving that there’s always money in spoof comedies, Fox’s \"Epic Movie\" shot straight to number one over the weekend in its debut frame beating out three other new releases plus a handful of expanding Academy Award contenders. In fact, the immature laugher outgrossed all five Oscar nominees for best picture combined.The crime drama \"Smokin’ Aces\" and the Jennifer Garner dramedy \"Catch and Release\" both enjoyed good results in their opening weekends, however the new horror flick \"Blood and Chocolate\" failed to even make the top ten. Most holdovers remained strong as the overall marketplace bounced back from last weekend’s dismal results.Matching the numbers it posted a year ago with \"Date Movie,\" Fox struck again with \"Epic Movie\" which topped the charts with an estimated $19.2M from 2,801 theaters. The PG-13 film lampooned several recent box office action hits and averaged a solid $6,855 per site. \"Date Movie\" skewered numerous romantic comedies and bowed to a similar $19.1M last February over the three-day portion of the Presidents’ Day holiday weekend. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, whose writing credits include \"Date Movie,\" \"Spy Hard,\" and the entire \"Scary Movie\" series, wrote and directed \"Epic.\" Teenagers made up a large portion of the audience and both genders were well-represented. Critics who did bother to review it trashed the film.\"Epic Movie\": 0 percent Tomatometer, $19 million openingOpening in second place with impressive results and similar per-theater success was Universal’s mob thriller \"Smokin’ Aces\" with an estimated $14.3M from 2,218 locations. Averaging a commendable $6,430 per site, the frame’s only new R-rated pic connected with young men as its primary audience. According to studio research, 59% of the audience was male and 57% was 25 or older. \"Smokin’\" stars Jeremy Piven, Andy Garcia, and Alicia Keys and cost less than $20M to produce which should make it a profitable venture when all worldwide rights are exploited. The film also opened at number one in Russia this weekend with $1.7M and has grossed an additional $5.3M from the United Kingdom after its third weekend.Alicia Keys, in her big-screen debutThe unstoppable blockbuster comedy \"Night at the Museum\" enjoyed yet another small decline sliding only 21% in its sixth weekend to an estimated $9.5M. The Ben Stiller–Robin Williams smash has pumped its cume up to $216.7M and will soon join the top 50 domestic blockbusters of all-time.Jennifer Garner generated respectable results for her latest film \"Catch and Release\" which was not given a very wide release, but still sold an estimated $8M in ticket stubs. Averaging a solid $4,932 from 1,622 playdates, the PG-13 film about a woman rebuilding her life after her husband’s death played heavily female. According to Sony’s research, an overwhelming 75% of the crowd consisted of women and 58% was 25 or older. \"Catch\" cost $25M to produce and opened smaller than her previous headlining efforts \"13 Going on 30\" ($21.1M in 2004) and \"Elektra\" ($12.8M in 2005). Reviews were mostly negative.\"Catch and Release\": At 22 percent, it’s better than \"Elektra\"Sony’s \"Stomp the Yard,\" 2007’s top-grossing new release, slipped only 37% and took fifth with an estimated $7.8M. Total stands at an impressive $50.7M.A quartet of Oscar-nominated films followed. Paramount’s musical \"Dreamgirls,\" which led all films with eight Academy Award nominations, expanded from 2,214 to 2,785 sites and grossed an estimated $6.6M. That represented a slim 17% drop in sales from last weekend but a steeper 34% fall in the per-theater average which was $2,376. Cume to date is $86.7M. Despite not earning a best picture nomination, \"Dreamgirls\" is still holding up well and posting relatively low declines.\"And You, And You, And You…You’re Gonna Snub Me\"Also showing durability was Will Smith‘s \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" which earned the box office star an Academy nod for best actor. The Sony blockbuster dipped only 21% to an estimated $5M pushing its sum to $152.9M. \"Pursuit\" did not have any expansion, but instead lost 378 theaters and still witnessed a decline similar to that of \"Dreamgirls\" which scored many more Oscar nominations and added hundreds of playdates to its run.The fantasy tale \"Pan’s Labyrinth\" widened from 609 to 823 sites and grossed an estimated $4.5M equaling its gross from last weekend. Nominated in six different categories, the Mexican film saw its per-theater average dip 26% from last weekend to a still-solid $5,474. Total is $16.3M for the Picturehouse release.\"The Queen\" saw a healthy bump in sales and ranked ninth for the weekend with an estimated $4M, up 18%, for a $41.2M sum to date. Miramax added 244 additional venues and saw its average inch up 2% to $2,186.Rounding out the top ten was a film that has approximately zero chance of earning any Academy Award nominations a year from now. The horror film \"The Hitcher\" tumbled 54% in its second weekend to an estimated $3.6M giving Focus only $13.4M to date. A $16-18M final seems likely.Opening poorly outside of the top ten was yet another horror film, the werewolf thriller \"Blood and Chocolate,\" which bowed to only $2.1M according to estimates. The PG-13 film attacked 1,200 theaters and averaged a weak $1,753 per venue for MGM.With last Tuesday’s Academy Award nominations putting several films into the media spotlight, distributors took the opportunity to expand their contenders and saw increased weekend grosses, even though averages were mostly not very impressive. Best picture candidate \"The Departed,\" which was near the end of its theatrical run after opening in early October, went back into national release and grossed an estimated $3M. Averaging $2,096 per site in 1,453 locations, the Martin Scorsese crime saga upped its cume to $124.9M. Its best picture rival \"Babel\" widened to 1,090 playdates and grossed an estimated $2.6M for a $2,368 average. Sales were up 25% from last weekend while the average inched up 2% with the total reaching $27.2M.Clint Eastwood‘s \"Letters From Iwo Jima,\" which has been holding back much of its release in anticipation of Oscar nods, added 55 theaters to its run and surged 26% to an estimated $1.7M. The Warner Bros. release averaged a decent but not spectacular $4,120 from 415 locations. The average increased a healthy 9% from last weekend and the subtitled film has collected $4.9M to date as \"Letters\" remained the lowest-grossing best picture nominee by far. But much potential could still be ahead of it.Among films with high profile acting nominations, Fox Searchlight’s \"Notes on a Scandal\" more than tripled its run to 640 theaters and grossed an estimated $2.5M as the weekend take doubled. The Judi Dench–Cate Blanchett pic averaged $3,978 per playdate and has taken in $9M thus far. The distributor’s Forest Whitaker drama \"The Last King of Scotland\" remained mostly steady with its theater count and saw its gross inch up 3% to an estimated $1.7M for a $7.7M total. Sony Classics more than quadrupled the run of Penelope Cruz‘s \"Volver\" and took in an estimated $1.2M from 689 sites. The average was diluted down to just $1,671 as the total climbed to $8.9M.The industry often looks at a film’s box office boost on the weekend after Academy Award nominations are announced to determine how much gold an Oscar nod is worth. But what is often overlooked is the additional marketing and distribution expense that is invested by a distributor to create new marketing materials, buy more advertising, and ship extra prints out across the country. Expanding these films in a crowded marketplace is not cheap, but studios do believe that there are long-term benefits to be gained by the added attention like extra momentum in overseas and video markets, plus possibly some added votes from Academy members. In addition, it is difficult to separate the sales that are due directly to the Oscar attention from those that would have occured anyway even if no nominations came through.Three films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. Paramount’s high school drama \"Freedom Writers\" dipped 33% to an estimated $3.5M in its fourth session. The Hilary Swank pic has grossed a respectable $31.3M to date and should finish with about $36-38M. The MGM family release \"Arthur and the Invisibles\" dropped 46% to an estimated $1.7M for a $11.5M cume. A disappointing $14M final seems likely.Universal’s futuristic drama \"Children of Men\" scored three Oscar nominations, but it meant little to its ticket sales. The R-rated drama fell 46% to an estimated $2M lifting the sum to $30.7M. The Alfonso Cuaron-directed film should conclude with around $35M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82.4M which was down 12% from last year when \"Big Momma’s House 2\" opened at number one with $27.7M; and down 16% from 2005 when \"Hide and Seek\" debuted on top with $22M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Best, Country, Christmas, razzies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Epic-Movie-Conquers-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509158691941","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Dragons and Webs Duke It Out at Theaters","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Dragons and Webs Duke It Out at Theatersby Gitesh Pandya | December 14, 2006 |  CommentsHollywood studios try to inject some juice into the North American box office this weekend by unleashing three big new releases aimed at getting people back into the habit of going to the movies.Boys will be courted with the fantasy adventure pic \"Eragon,\" girls will get to play with \"Charlotte’s Web,\" and adults looking for a feel-good story to counter their holiday shopping blues will have the father-and-son Smith team in \"The Pursuit of Happyness.\"The dragon tale \"Eragon\" attacks the cinemas on Friday giving fantasy audiences the entertainment they’ve been missing this holiday season. Fox’s PG-rated actioner will try to fill a void in a season without a \"Potter,\" \"Narnia,\" or \"Hobbit.\" Don’t expect grosses to come close to the numbers posted by those megahits, but if \"Eragon\" can still reach a portion of that huge audience, the studio will be happy. Ordinarily, the effects-driven film would probably have a tough time at the box office but thanks to a severe lack of competition, Fox has a golden opportunity. The marketing push has been strong and young males have little else to be excited by. Gamers might also be interested in seeing this adventure on the big screen and leave behind their new hardware for a couple of hours. A built-in audience of readers of the book will help too. Landing in 3,020 theaters, \"Eragon\" could open with around $23M this weekend.The latest fantasy novel turned fantasy epic: \"Eragon.\"The beloved children’s story \"Charlotte’s Web\" hits the multiplexes with Hollywood’s favorite young girl Dakota Fanning in the lead role. Paramount’s G-rated tale will aim for family audiences and is using the starpower of voice actors Julia Roberts, Oprah Winfrey, and John Cleese to connect with parents. With \"Happy Feet\" being the only major family film to do well over the past few weeks, kids should be ready to move on to something new. Girls will probably outnumber the boys here especially with \"Eragon\" opening at the same time. But the brand is known and the rating is tame so parents will look at this as a safe bet for their younger ones. Good reviews will help too. With children going on their school holidays soon, look for long-term strength as many will wait until Christmas week to go and see it. Opening in over 3,000 theaters, \"Charlotte’s Web\" might take in about $21M this weekend.\"Charlotte’s Web,\" no longer in animated form.Will Smith and his real-life son Jaden Smith hit the big screen together in Sony’s uplifting drama \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" which aims to give adult moviegoers something to see this weekend. Based on the true story of Chris Gardner, the PG-13 film tells the story of a man who hits hard times and becomes homeless and moonlights during the day in a stock broker training program hoping for a new lease on life. \"Pursuit\" has gotten Smith some notice for his acting performance (including a Golden Globe nomination) and the novelty of seeing father and son in a movie together will certainly help sell tickets. The man in black has some of the strongest pull among Hollywood stars at the box office with appeal that transcends all age, race, and gender lines. It’s no wonder that he is now pursuing his tenth $100M blockbuster.Reviews have been mixed for the film overall even though Smith is hearing buzz about a possible Oscar nomination. Sony must have been hoping for better reactions from critics though. Instead, the studio will appeal directly to adult moviegoers and their desire to see an uplifting feel-good story anchored by a popular star at this time of year. Don’t expect \"Pursuit\" to reach the levels of the actor’s last film \"Hitch\" which bowed to $43.1M from 3,575 theaters for a $12,068 average. But if good word-of-mouth circulates, it could stay in the top ten throughout the holiday season and go on to be a winner. Appeal looks solid with both men and women plus a strong turnout from African Americans will help to boost the grosses. Opening in 2,852 theaters, \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" might debut with around $19M.Will Smith and son, playing Chris Gardner and son, in \"The Pursuit of Happyness.\"Opening with special solo engagements in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco is the lavish musical \"Dreamgirls\" starring Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson. Paramount and DreamWorks are putting on a special live roadshow performance with these engageemnts for ten days before the film expands across the country on December 25. In New York City, \"Dreamgirls\" opens exclusively at the giant Ziegfeld theater which has already sold out its five weekend performances. With a giant auditorium of 1,200 seats and ticket prices of $25, look for this one theater to contribute over $100,000 to the weekend gross. West Coast venues hope to contribute similar numbers. Though the gross will be inflated by the ticket price, sky high demand thanks to critics awards, Globe nods, and Oscar buzz has already led to Friday’s opening night shows in California to sell out as well.\"Dreamgirls,\" opening in limited locations.Other new films entering the marketplace in limited release include Steven Soderbergh‘s World War II drama \"The Good German\" starring George Clooney, Cate Blanchett, and Tobey Maguire from Warner Bros. MGM counters with its Iraq War drama \"Home of the Brave\" starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica Biel, Christina Ricci, and 50 Cent. The Weinstein Company platforms the Jude Law thriller \"Breaking and Entering\" from director Anthony Minghella in an Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles.Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson in \"Home of the Brave.\"Among holdovers, last weekend’s top film \"Apocalypto\" moves into its all-important second weekend which will indicate what type of staying power Mel Gibson‘s latest film has. Curiousity and media hype helped to bring out moviegoers on the first weekend, but will they keep coming? The Buena Vista release fared much better than expected on Sunday grossing $840,000 more than originally expected. The studio expected a Sunday drop of 38% but was pleased to see the bloody epic dip only 23%. This weekend’s three new offerings do not look to give too much of a direct threat to \"Apocalypto\" so a 35% drop may in order. That would give the Mayan adventure about $9M for the frame and $29M in ten days.Warner Bros. will see some competition for its penguin blockbuster \"Happy Feet,\" but its hit toon has been holding up quite well each week. A 35% fall would leave \"Feet\" with around $8.5M and allow it to flirt with the $150M mark. Sony’s \"The Holiday\" got off to a decent but not spectacular start with its $12.8M bow. The Cameron Diaz–Kate Winslet starrer may slide 35% to roughly $8.5M pushing the total to $25M after ten days.LAST YEAR: Leaping into the number one spot, although with less muscle than expected, Peter Jackson‘s \"King Kong\" opened with $50.1M over the weekend and $66.2M over its five-day debut. Universal’s mega-budgeted ape flick went on to gross a commendable $218.1M domestically and $549M worldwide which fell a bit short of the film’s lofty expectations given its budget and filmmaker. \"Kong\" knocked fellow effects-driven actioner \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" to second place with $31.8M dropping 51% in its sophomore frame. \"Narnia\" would eventually climb back into the top spot. Debuting in third was the romantic comedy \"The Family Stone\" starring Sarah Jessica Parker with $12.5M on its way to $60.1M for Fox. Warner Bros. rounded out the top five with \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" which grossed $6M and \"Syriana\" which collected $5.6M. No other films dared to open against \"King Kong,\" however the critically acclaimed \"Brokeback Mountain\" expanded to just 69 theaters in its second weekend and jumped into the top ten with $2.5M for a scorching $36,355 average.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"El, Trailer, Crunchyroll, kaiju, women, Anna, films, Television, bond","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Dragons-and-Webs-Duke-It-Out-at-Theaters"},{"id":"47509157191772","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Stomp Still Sits at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Stomp Still Sits at #1by Gitesh Pandya | January 22, 2007 |  CommentsBox office sales slumped this weekend as the top ten dipped to its worst level in four months with the college dance pic \"Stomp the Yard\" holding onto the top spot by a thin margin. Moviegoers ignored \"The Hitcher,\" the frame’s only new wide release, which posted an underwhelming fourth-place debut. A handful of Oscar contenders expanded into wider release and saw encouraging results hoping to collect steady sales from serious film lovers in the weeks ahead. Overall, the marketplace was quiet as the gross for the number one film and the cume for the top ten were both the lowest since mid-September.\"Stomp the Yard\" spent another weekend at the top.Sony’s low-budget hit \"Stomp the Yard\" spent another weekend at the top of the charts grossing an estimated $13.3M dropping only 39% in its sophomore frame. The PG-13 hit showed a healthy hold since most films catering to teen and young adult audiences fall by 45% or more on the second weekend. After ten days, the $14M-budgeted pic has grossed a stellar $41.6M and is on its way to reaching $65-70M. \"Stomp\" averaged a solid $6,485 from 2,051 theaters in its second step.Close behind in second place was the Fox juggernaut \"Night at the Museum\" which took in an estimated $13M, off only 24%, boosting the cume to $205.8M. On Saturday, the PG-rated Ben Stiller film became the sixth 2006 release to join the double century club. \"Museum\" now ranks fifth among last year’s releases and is likely to surpass the $217.5M of \"The Da Vinci Code\" to end off as the fourth biggest blockbuster released in 2006. With no major family films getting in its way in the coming weeks, \"Museum\" could find its way to nearly $240M from North America alone and over $450M worldwide.\"Dreamgirls\" saw a rise in its popularity after Gloden Globes wins.Thanks to a trio of Golden Globes and 307 additional theaters, the hit musical \"Dreamgirls\" saw its Friday-to-Sunday gross inch up 4% to an estimated $8.7M Averaging a respectable $3,935 from 2,214 sites in its fourth full weekend of national play, the Paramount/DreamWorks pic upped its cume to $78.1M and is easily on its way to joining the $100M club. The studio continues to spend lavishly on advertising and is eagerly anticipating Tuesday’s announcement of the Academy Award nominations. \"Dreamgirls\" is widely considered a shoo-in for a nomination for Best Picture, along with \"The Departed\" and \"Babel.\"Showing that horror fans may be getting sick of Hollywood’s endless line of fright film remakes, \"The Hitcher\" opened to disappointing results in fourth place with only $8.2M, according to estimates. The redo of the 1986 Rutger Hauer flick averaged only $2,904 from a very wide 2,835 theaters for Focus and its Rogue Pictures genre unit. The R-rated film was expected to perform better given that it was the only new choice for teens and young adults and the fact that it was given the widest bow in company history for its distributor. The strong hold for \"Stomp the Yard\" and the solid expansion of \"Pan’s Labyrinth\" which is pulling in fantasy and horror fans, may have contributed to the soft bow.\"The Hitcher\" is not exactly catching fire at the B.O.\"The Hitcher\" is the latest in a string of disappointments for Focus following \"Catch a Fire\" and \"The Return.\" Since last winter’s Oscar-winning film \"Brokeback Mountain\" lassoed $83M, the distributor has seen most of its films underperform. The company saw an average domestic gross of just $13.4M from its eight wide releases in 2006 with \"Jet Li’s Fearless\" being its top grosser with $24.6M.Will Smith’s \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" clocked its sixth weekend in the top five and grossed an estimated $6.7M, off only 25%, for a $146.5M cume. Sony should finish in the vicinity of $160M. Paramount’s Hilary Swank drama \"Freedom Writers\" followed with an estimated $5.6M, down just 24%, giving the pic $26.9M in 17 days. Look for the film to end in the $35-40M range.Guillermo del Toro‘s fantasy thriller \"Pan’s Labyrinth\" jumped into the top ten thanks to its national expansion and claimed the number seven spot with an estimated $4.7M. The Picturehouse release enjoyed the best average among all wide releases taking in $7,759 per theater from 609 locations. Cume is $10.2M for the Spanish-language film. The futuristic drama \"Children of Men\" from director Alfonso Cuaron followed falling 42% to an estimated $3.7M for Universal pushing the cume to $27.5M.Helen Mirren in \"The Queen.\"Also collecting an estimated $3.7M in ticket sales over the weekend was Miramax’s \"The Queen\" which expanded from 344 to 1,586 theaters following its two Golden Globe wins for lead actress and screenplay. Averaging a mild $2,333 per site, the acclaimed drama hit the top ten for only the second time in its long 17-week run and posted its best weekend gross to date. It had always played in fewer than 800 theaters until now and the distributor hopes that the Globe wins, plus the expected Oscar nominations on Tuesday, will allow the Helen Mirren film to appeal to a wider audience going forward. Total stands at $35.9M and counting. Rounding out the top ten was MGM’s \"Arthur and the Invisibles\" with an estimated $3.1M, down 28%, for a $9.3M cume. A final gross of around $15M seems likely.The box office had a very international flavor this weekend as seven of the top twelve films were directed by filmmakers born outside of the United States.Three films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. Universal’s kidnapping thriller \"Alpha Dog\" tumbled 55% in its second frame and took in an estimated $2.9M. With only $11.7M in the bank, the ensemble pic should sputter to a disappointing $15-17M final tally. Also crumbling in its sophomore frame was the horror film \"Primeval\" which crashed 70% and grossed $1.8M, according to estimates. Buena Vista has scared up just $9.5M in ten days and looks to conclude its run quickly with a poor $11M.Paramount’s kidpic \"Charlotte’s Web\" has fared better over the holiday season and grossed an estimated $2.3M this weekend, down 40%. The family film has accumulated a solid $76.7M to date and should end its run with around $80M. Web bowed in mid-December with half the opening weekend gross of competing new release \"Eragon,\" but has now outgrossed the dragon adventure which currently stands at $72.4M.\"Babel\" took home a Golden Globe for Best Picture in Drama.A trio of Golden Globe winners expanded their runs and climbed up the charts. Paramount Vantage’s \"Babel,\" which took home the Best Picture — Drama trophy, re-expanded from 173 to 889 theaters and took in an estimated $2.3M for a $23.9M total to date. Fox Searchlight boosted its cume for \"The Last King of Scotland\" by 50% in one short weekend. The Forest Whitaker pic widened to 495 locations, from just four from last weekend, and collected an estimated $1.8M raising the total from $3.7M to $5.5M. Warner Bros. went from 35 to 360 locations for Clint Eastwood’s \"Letters From Iwo Jima\" which grossed an estimated $1.5M pushing the tally to $2.6M. Though not eligible for the Academy Award in the foreign language department, the Japanese-lingo pic is still considered a contender in the other Oscar categories.The top ten films grossed an estimated $70.7M which was off a disturbing 19% from last year when \"Underworld: Evolution\" opened at number one with $26.9M; and down 10% from 2005 when \"Are We There Yet?\" debuted on top with $18.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Horror, franchise","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Stomp-Still-Sits-at-1"},{"id":"47509157206111","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Can Sony \"Stomp\" the \"Museum?\"","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Can Sony \"Stomp\" the \"Museum?\"by Gitesh Pandya | January 11, 2007 |  CommentsCan Ben Stiller and his living artifacts four-peat at the top of the North American box office, or will one of the new releases take the crown over the four-day Dr. Martin Luther King holiday weekend? Ticket buyers will decide.Leading the freshman class is the dance drama \"Stomp the Yard\" which could have breakout potential. Also opening are the fantasy pic \"Arthur and the Invisibles,\" the drug dealer pic \"Alpha Dog,\" and the horror flick \"Primeval.\" With so many schools closed on Monday, the new films are targeting students of all ages who will have extra time on their hands.The west and east coasts meet in \"Stomp the Yard,\" a story of a Los Angeles student enrolled in an Atlanta university who uses his unique style to help his fraternity compete in a step dancing contest. The PG-13 film is short on starpower, but makes up for that with terrific marketing which is the real ingredient that will put asses into the seats. Sony has cut exciting trailers and commercial spots which should spark lots of interest with teens and young adults. Plus, MLK weekend is the perfect time to open a black college film since interest will be high for this particular subject matter. African American students will especially be out in solid numbers. However, the opening of Justin Timberlake‘s \"Alpha Dog\" could take away some of the young adult crowd.\"Stomp\" should appeal to the same audiences that delivered bigger-than-expected openings for \"Drumline\" ($12.6M opening, $6,865 average), \"ATL\" ($11.6M, $7,212), and \"You Got Served\" ($16.1M, $8,341). The urban youth of America possesses tremendous spending power and Hollywood has just woken up to this in recent years financing low cost flicks that return handsome profits through theatrical and DVD sales. \"Stomp\" also offers an appealing story relevant to today’s young people and looks to join this list. Stepping into 2,051 theaters, \"Stomp the Yard\" could collect about $16M over four days this weekend.An action shot from \"Stomp the Yard.\"The weekend’s only new kidpic comes in the form of the French production \"Arthur and the Invisibles,\" a groundbreaking feature which mixes live-action with animation in a fantasy tale. The PG-rated film from The Weinstein Co. is directed by action professional Luc Besson (\"The Fifth Element,\" \"Joan of Arc\") and features the voices of Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Snoop Dogg, and Madonna. With so many young children across the country having a long school holiday, \"Arthur\" should get some play as the only new option for parents who have taken enough trips to the Museum. Of course \"Happily N’Ever After\" flopping last weekend shows that family audiences will not come out for just anything. With about 2,500 theaters, it is the widest of the new titles which could help it get into double digit millions over the extended frame. The marketing push has been admirable too. MLK weekend has often seen better-than-expected results for debuting kiddie flicks like \"Kangaroo Jack,\" \"Racing Stripes,\" and \"Hoodwinked.\" \"Arthur and the Invisibles\" may carve out its share of the pie and gross roughly $11M over the four-day period.Those troll dolls have found a new purpose in \"Arthur and the Invisibles.\"Pop music king Justin Timberlake joins an ensemble cast which includes Emile Hirsch, Sharon Stone, and Bruce Willis in the gritty drama \"Alpha Dog.\" Directed by Nick Cassavetes, the R-rated film tells of a drug dealer who kidnaps the younger brother of a friend who owes a debt. The Universal release is based on true events and will target older teens and twentysomethings. The marketing makes the film look slick and cool plus JT provides a built-in audience of fans that can be tapped into.However, two main obstacles are in the way – the rating and competition from \"Stomp the Yard.\" A large portion of Timberlake’s fans are young teens and they will have a hard time buying tickets. Plus, \"Stomp\" will be distracting the urban youth with its slick look and milder PG-13 rating. On top of that, the studio’s release is not too wide. These factors should curtail the potential of \"Alpha.\" Critics have given solid support which may help a little, although Time Out New York boldly calls the pic the worst movie of the year in its zero-star review. Opening in about 1,200 theaters, \"Alpha Dog\" might bite down on around $8M over the long weekend.Timberlake gets down in \"Alpha Dog.\"Every horror film since Halloween has flopped and the streak looks to continue with \"Primeval\" from Buena Vista. The R-rated film about a news crew hunting down a killer boasts no starpower and lacks a compelling plot worthy of the ten-dollar bills of genre fans. Marketing support has been weak and awareness is not very high. The fright flick seems to have the same potential as last month’s \"Turistas\" which bowed to a weak $3.6M and $2,282 average. \"Primeval\" will open wider with about 2,000 theaters and has an extended four-day session so a gross of roughly $6M could result followed by steep drops.Zhang Yimou has seen solid but not spectacular averages for his latest Chinese epic \"Curse of the Golden Flower\" which has already grossed $2.2M from its limited release in about 60 theaters. Its average of $6,104 last weekend will drop considerably as it expands nationwide into about 1,200 playdates. The Mandarin-language period piece seems to be going too wide too fast and with all the choices in the multiplexes, Sony Classics may find it difficult to get multiplex crowds into all those new seats. \"Curse\" will try to play to fans of the \"Hero\" director, but Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li are no Jet Li and Zhang Ziyi at the American box office. A $4M gross over the long weekend could result.These horses must be suffering from \"The Curse of the Golden Flower.\"Ben Stiller and Will Smith have been inseparable blockbuster brothers atop the box office charts for the last three weeks. But the weekend’s new releases should finally cause a breakup. Stiller’s runaway smash \"Night at the Museum\" has been holding up incredibly well against any competition that has come its way and will attempt to become the first film since 2003’s \"The Return of the King\" to remain number one for four consecutive weekends. The only thing standing in its path is a possible teen explosion for \"Stomp.\" \"Museum’s\" four-day holiday gross could slip 25% from last weekend’s three-day figure giving the Fox hit about $18M and a remarkable cume to date of $187M.Smith has done pretty well for himself too with \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" which should see another solid turnout over MLK weekend. A 20% drop would give Sony a four-day tally of $10M boosting its total to a stellar $137M.Since it opened nationally on Christmas Day, \"Dreamgirls\" has been posting the best per-theater averages of any wide release. Now, Paramount will more than double the run and expand the Golden Globe nominee for Best Picture – Comedy or Musical from 852 to about 1,800 theaters. The Jamie Foxx–Beyonce Knowles musical is the favorite to take home that honor, plus other statues, and the studio wants to make sure the product is available everywhere once the wins occur. Plus, films with African American casts routinely do very well over the King frame so a jump in sales is assured. For the four-day period, \"Dreamgirls\" may climb to around $11M putting the cume at $68M. If it wins the Globe for Best Picture and secures a sizable number of Oscar nominations the following week, the total domestic take could certainly surpass the $100M mark as it did for \"Chicago\" four years ago. The Richard Gere musical reached a similar $63.8M at the end of the weekend it went fully national into 1,841 locations and went on to a sensational $170.7M final total.LAST YEAR: Disney kicked off the first of what would be many hit sports flicks in 2006 with the basketball drama \"Glory Road\" which opened at number one over MLK weekend with $16.9M over four days. The live action film barely beat out the animated comedy \"Hoodwinked\" which also grossed $16.9M over the Friday-to-Monday period, but was about $50,000 shy of the number one spot. The duo reached $42.6M and $51.2M, respectively. Third place also was held by a new release. Paramount’s Queen Latifah comedy \"Last Holiday\" bowed to a solid $15.5M on its way to $38.4M. Rounding out the top five were former number ones \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" with $12.8M and \"Hostel\" with $11.4M over the long weekend. Fox’s romance \"Tristan &amp; Isolde\" found few lovers in its debut opening to $7.6M on its way to just $14.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"hard, slashers, halloween, Central, movies, australia, indiana, toronto, Month, Red","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Can-Sony-Stomp-the-Museum"},{"id":"47509157210209","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: New Year Brings New Crop of Pics","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: New Year Brings New Crop of Picsby Gitesh Pandya | January 4, 2007 |  CommentsThree new releases welcome in the new year this weekend, but moviegoers are likely to keep spending their cash on holiday holdovers.Family audiences have the new toon \"Happily N’Ever After,\" teens will be offered the drama \"Freedom Writers,\" and the comedy crowd will have \"Code Name: The Cleaner.\" Also, the sci-fi drama \"Children of Men\" expands across the country after a powerful debut last weekend in limited release. Early January is usually home to two kinds of films – weak pictures that can’t cut it during the competitive holiday season and acclaimed films expanding wider hoping for awards. This frame will see just that with current chart-topper \"Night at the Museum\" hoping for a third reign in the number one spot.Kids who have had enough of digital penguins will have a chance to see a new animated film this weekend with Lionsgate’s \"Happily N’Ever After.\" The PG-rated film tells the story of Fairy Tale World after Cinderella’s wicked stepmother takes charge. Sigourney Weaver, Andy Dick, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and hubby Freddie Prinze Jr. lend their voices. \"After\" has a funny premise and with \"Shrek the Third\" still four months away, some audiences may give this one a try for the time being. Last January, \"Hoodwinked\" posted some strong numbers playing to the same crowd and bowed to $16.9M over four days with a potent $7,051 average. \"Happily\" does not have the same marketing strength behind it plus it faces more competition. Last weekend, six films with G or PG ratings sold over $10Mworth of tickets over four days and even with heavy declines, there will be lots of choices for family audiences. Looking to attract the biggest opening among the three new films on Friday, \"Happily N’Ever After\" enters 2,381 theaters and may take in around $7M this weekend.The British animated import \"Happily N’Ever After.\"Two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank takes the Michelle Pfeiffer route and plays a teacher schooling a group of inner city kids in \"Freedom Writers\" from Paramount and MTV Films. Directed by writer-turned-director Richard LaGravenese, the PG-13 film also stars \"Grey’s Anatomy\" hunk Patrick Dempsey. Teens and urban youngsters will make up the core audience here as Swank’s mature adult following will likely pass on this role. The actress just doesn’t have the commercial chops to anchor a film like this on her own and the buzz is not loud enough for this to become the next \"Dangerous Minds.\" Paramount is hoping that its push on MTV will help bring in the young vote, but the pic lacks the bang to make teens want to spend the bucks. Opening in about 1,200 theaters, \"Freedom Writers\" could debut with around $5M.Hilary Swank, conjuring Michelle Pfeiffer and Edward James Olmos in \"Freedom Writers.\"Also expected to put only a small dent into the box office this weekend is the comedy \"Code Name: The Cleaner\" starring Cedric the Entertainer and Lucy Liu. Pairing black and Asian actors in an action comedy worked wonders for \"Rush Hour,\" but here audiences will likely find the premise forced. Cedric plays a janitor who is duped into becoming an undercover agent and finds himself in the middle of an arms scandal. Both stars are great supporting players but neither has a track record of anchoring big hit films. Interested moviegoers will probably wait for the DVD. Look for the New Line release to also debut in the vicinity of $5M.\"Codename: The Cleaner\" isn’t expected to clean up at the boxoffice.Expanding nationwide on Friday into 1,200 locations after a powerful limited bow is Universal’s futuristic drama \"Children of Men.\" The Alfonso Cuaron-directed pic about the London of the future where no humans have been born in eighteen years stars Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine. The R-rated film debuted to $702,982 from only 16 theaters for a sensational four-day average of $43,936. Serious adult moviegoers are the target audience here so the studio’s own CIA thriller \"The Good Shepherd\" will be the primary competitor. Reviews have been strong which will help. For the weekend, \"Children of Men\" could deliver roughly $7M.Clive Owen and his golden aura in \"Children of Men.\"Since the incoming line-up of films is not likely to do too much damage to the box office charts, it should be smooth sailing for \"Night at the Museum\" which looks to spend its third straight weekend at number one. \"Happily N’Ever After\" will take away a bit of the family crowd, but overall competition should not be too intense. Coming off of the holiday weekend, the Ben Stiller smash may drop 40% and collect $22M worth of tickets and push its stellar cume to $163M.Will Smith‘s Golden Globe-nominated performance in \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" has kept moviegoers interested for three weeks. The Sony hit may slide 40% as well grossing $11.5M which would give the father-son venture $123M to date. \"Dreamgirls\" has been generating the best averages around since opening. Paramount could witness a 35% drop to around $9M for the frame and lift its cume to $55M.LAST YEAR: Horror fans powered the new fright flick \"Hostel\" to the number one spot over the first weekend of 2006 with a $19.6M debut. The low budget Lionsgate hit went on to scare up $47.3M. Holdovers filled up the rest of the top five. \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" slipped to second with $15.6M followed by \"King Kong\" with $12.6M. The comedies \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" and \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\" took up the next spots with $11.9M and $8.4M, respectively. The weekend’s two other new releases bombed miserably. Fox’s comedy \"Grandma’s Boy\" bowed to just $3M while the actioner \"BloodRayne\" barely made it into the Top 20 with $1.6M.

With little new competition for older adults or families, holdover films in the top ten playing to those two audience segments witnessed good holds and dropped by less than 40% each. Overall, the marketplace was about even with last year’s when the second Saw dominated the charts.Saw III ripped into theaters and cut up an estimated $34.3M in ticket sales in its debut frame scoring the biggest opening for an R-rated film in nearly two and a half years. The brutal Jigsaw pic crushed the competition averaging a brutal $10,830 from 3,167 theaters and grossed more than the next four films combined. Lionsgate continued to grow its low budget October franchise. The first Saw opened this weekend in 2004 to $18.3M and reached $55.2M while its sequel bowed a year later to $31.7M on its way to $87M. Saw III, which was reportedly produced for only $12M, is already off to a stronger start with an opening that was 8% bloodier than its predecessor’s. The distrib also set new company records for both widest release and biggest opening weekend gross.The latest installment of the Saw series got off to a potent start on Friday grossing $14.4M before tumbling 21% on Saturday to $11.4M. A Friday-to-Saturday drop is not uncommon for heavily-hyped horror sequels. Sunday sales are estimated to dip only 25% to $8.5M. No R pic has opened this well since Brad Pitt‘s epic Troy with $46.9M in May 2004. Based on the history of the franchise with Halloween providing a boost, but subsequent weekends dropping hard, the torture trilogy could boost its combined domestic tally to a stunning $230M. Combined production budgets amount to less than one-tenth of that figure. Lionsgate has no plans to shut down its cash machine and is developing Saw IV for a Halloween 2007 release.For the third consecutive weekend, Martin Scorsese‘s mob hit The Departed was the nation’s second most popular film and grossed an estimated $9.8M. Dipping only 27% in its fourth frame, the Warner Bros. release has now made off with a sturdy $91.1M and looks headed for at least $125M domestically thanks to its terrific legs. The Departed is the studio’s second biggest film of 2006 after the $200M of the megabudgeted Superman Returns.Falling from first to third place was the dueling magicians tale The Prestige with an estimated $9.6M, off a respectable 35%. After ten days, the Buena Vista release has collected $28.8M and seems headed towards the $50-55M range. In its sophomore frame, the Hugh Jackman–Christian Bale thriller still averaged a solid $4,220 per theater.Clint Eastwood‘s war drama Flags of Our Fathers added more guns to its run with 314 additional theaters, but still slumped 38% in its second weekend to an estimated $6.4M. After ten days, the $90M Paramount release has taken in just $19.9M and did not hold up as well as previous films from the Oscar-winning director. In their second weekends of wide release, Mystic River dropped only 25% in October 2003 while Million Dollar Baby dipped just 31% in February 2005. Plus, neither film had a major expansion of screens. Flags saw its per-theater average fall 47% from last weekend to only $2,900. The World War II pic seems headed for a poor finish of around $40M. Overseas prospects also do not seem too bright as American military pics are not the most popular exports to come out of Hollywood.Still the top-grossing movie for kids for the fifth straight weekend was Sony’s Open Season with an estimated $6.1M, down only 25%, for a robust $77.4M cume. Fox’s horse drama Flicka dropped a reasonable 35% in its second weekend to an estimated $5M as it faced no new competition for family audiences. With $14.1M in ten days, the PG-rated film could finish up with a respectable $26-28M and do better on DVD early next year. Universal’s Man of the Year dropped 32% to an estimated $4.7M giving the Robin Williams comedy $28.9M to date.Sony rounded out the top ten with the final three flicks. The horror sequel The Grudge 2 scared up an estimated $3.3M, down 57%, to put its total at $36M after 17 days. The Kirsten Dunst period piece Marie Antoinette tumbled an alarming 47% in its second weekend grossing an estimated $2.9M. With a mere $9.8M in ten days, the Sofia Coppola pic should conclude with a disappointing $14-16M.The studio also expanded its dysfunctional family comedy Running with Scissors from eight theaters in limited release last weekend to 586 locations nationally this weekend. Following its potent platform lauch, the Annette Bening film performed to moderate results nationwide with an estimated $2.6M for a mediocre $4,352 average. Cume to date stands at $2.9M for Scissors which was not well-liked by critics.Focus Features’ apartheid thriller Catch a Fire opened to weak results in moderate national release bowing to an estimated $2M from 1,306 theaters for a mild $1,541 average. Directed by Phillip Noyce (Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger), the PG-13 film stars Tim Robbins and Derek Luke and earned mostly positive reviews. Fire tried to perform like the distributor’s Africa-set thriller from last fall, The Constant Gardener. That film also boasted good reviews, some starpower, and a similar number of theaters. But Gardener opened in early September over the Labor Day holiday frame with a three-day bow of $8.7M from 1,346 theaters for a solid $6,444 average. Its timing could have played a big part in the more successful debut since there are usually very few serious movies for adults at the end of summer. Fire opened at the end of a two-month period that followed a string of ten fall films aimed at older adult moviegoers.An internationally-set film that did connect with moviegoers was the Brad Pitt–Cate Blanchett drama Babel which debuted in New York and Los Angeles in only seven theaters but grossed an estimated $366,000 for a colossal $52,258 average. The R-rated film was directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (21 Grams, Amores Perros) and followed separate stories in Morocco, Mexico, and Japan which become interlinked. Reviews were very good and the film won the best director award at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. Despite each of the seven locations playing the film on two or three screens, Babel still sold out numerous shows over the weekend. Paramount Vantage will expand the film on Friday into 13 new markets for a total of about 35 theaters and go national on November 10 into about 1,200 total playdates.The Weinstein Company got off to a solid start with its political documentary Shut Up and Sing which took in an estimated $51,000 from four theaters for an impressive $12,750 average. The R-rated film follows the musical trio The Dixie Chicks and how their lives were affected by remarks against President George W. Bush. Reviews were very favorable.Among notable holdovers in limited release, Miramax’s The Queen continued its slow but steady expansion widening again from 99 to 152 locations in its fifth session. The acclaimed Helen Mirren pic grossed an estimated $1.9M, averaging a strong $12,638, and lifted its cume to $6.3M. Parent company Disney saw its Halloween treat The Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D hold in 168 special engagements and took in an estimated $1.8M. Down 45% from its debut, the Tim Burton animated pic has grossed $5.9M in ten days and averaged $10,815 for the frame.A pair of October titles fell from the top ten this weekend. Fox’s The Marine dropped 48% to an estimated $2M in its third assignment and pushed its sum to $15.5M. Look for a weak $18-20M finish for the John Cena actioner. New Line saw its fright flick Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning tumble bringing its cume to $38M to date. The horror prequel will struggle to get to $40M giving it half of the $80.1M of 2003’s Chainsaw remake.The top ten films grossed an estimated $84.6M which was up a scant 2% from last year when Saw II debuted at number one with $31.7M; but off 5% from 2004 when The Grudge remained in the top spot with $21.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TBS, Amazon, rotten, Food, Disney, Hallmark, TCA, canceled, Family, Mudbound, Oscars, News, 71st, SDCC, globes","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Saw-III-Slices-Up-1-Opening-with-34M"},{"id":"47509160147060","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Prestige Defeats Flags for #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Prestige Defeats Flags for #1 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | October 22, 2006 |  CommentsThree well-reviewed dramas fought over the weekend box office crown, but it was a pair of dueling magicians that North American moviegoers chose first as The Prestige opened at the top of the charts. Close behind was the mob thriller The Departed which remained strong in its third weekend while Clint Eastwood‘s new war saga Flags of our Fathers settled for a third place debut.The weekend’s two other new releases targeted young females and found their way into the top ten as well. The family drama Flicka stumbled in wide release while the period pic Marie Antoinette did respectable business in moderate release. Overall ticket sales fell from last weekend, but were still up sharply versus a year ago.Leaving behind their super hero tights, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale topped the box office with The Prestige which opened to an estimated $14.8M. Averaging a strong $6,496 from 2,281 theaters, the PG-13 pic about two turn-of-the-century magicians who compete for tricks and the heart of a young woman was directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins). Bale reteamed with Nolan after playing the Caped Crusader while Jackman took three turns playing Wolverine in the X-Men films. The Prestige scored good marks from critics and co-starred Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, and David Bowie. With ample starpower, the period drama beat out its rivals to win the weekend and won a decisive victory over fellow freshman Flags which was expected to make a more competitive play for the number one spot. The Prestige also grossed an estimated $1M from international bows this weekend in Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan.Remaining in second place for the second straight weekend was Martin Scorsese‘s smash hit The Departed which dipped only 28% to an estimated $13.7M. After 17 days, the Leonardo DiCaprio–Matt Damon crime saga has taken in a potent $77.1M and is on a course to reach $110-120M or more depending on how long its sturdy legs last. The Warner Bros. release averaged an impressive $4,551 from 3,005 theaters in its third mission and is already the fall season’s top-grossing film. Overseas, Departed grossed an estimated $5.1M from 13 markets boosting its international cume to $25.3M. It ranks number one in the United Kingdom and Australia. The global gross for the Jack Nicholson mob pic has broken through the $100M mark with many more countries still to open. The undercover saga infiltrates Italy and Spain on Friday, and rolls into Brazil, France, and Germany in the weeks ahead followed by Japan in January.Clint Eastwood, who beat Scorsese at the Oscars in 2005, saw his newest directorial effort Flags of our Fathers lose out in its box office battle against his old rival. The World War II pic debuted to an estimated $10.2M from 1,876 theaters to claim third place. Averaging a good, but not spectacular, $5,437 per location, the Paramount release played to a much older male crowd. Studio research showed that a whopping 80% of the audience was over the age of 30 while men made up 55%. Reviews were good, but critics were not as supportive as they were for Eastwood’s last two films Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River.Budgeted at $90M, Flags was easily the filmmaker’s most ambitious project to date and told of the American soldiers who were photographed in Iwo Jima during the final years of the war. Eastwood pics are not known for their powerful openings as his fans typically take their time coming to theaters to see his films. It would be pointless to compare the box office of Flags to Baby since the latter was rolled out over time during Oscar season and didn’t open nationally until its seventh weekend right after it scored seven Academy Award nominations. However, it would be fair to compare Flags to Mystic which debuted nationally in its second frame to the tune of $10.4M from 1,467 theaters for a more potent $7,120 average. With less starpower and somewhat weaker reviews, the war tale generated an opening weekend average that was 24% smaller than River’s. Still, the road ahead for Flags could be durable as an encouraging 90% of those polled found it to be \"excellent\" or \"very good\".Warner Bros. found itself with a piece of all three of the weekend’s top films serving as a co-producer on each film. The studio is handling both The Prestige and Flags overseas. The latter pic was co-financed with DreamWorks which is handling it domestically through its new parent Paramount.The fall season’s only kids hit Open Season remained a strong contender grossing an estimated $8M for fourth place. Down only 28%, the animated Sony title has boosted its cume to $69.6M and now looks like it has a chance to flirt with the $100M mark and become the second biggest film in the September-October corridor after The Departed.Opening in fifth place with not-so-impressive results was the girl-and-her-horse drama Flicka which bowed to an estimated $7.7M from a very wide 2,877 theaters for a weak $2,676 average. Fox’s PG-rated family film performed a bit below the $9.2M opening of last year’s Dreamer, another story of a young girl and her steed, which galloped into theaters this very weekend playing to the same audience. The budget for Flicka was only $14M.Tied for fifth place was last weekend’s number one film The Grudge 2 which also scared up an estimated $7.7M, but tumbled a steep 63% in its sophomore frame. Sony’s horror sequel has taken in $31.4M in ten days which is less than half of the $70.7M that its 2004 predecessor grossed over the same period. The first Grudge held up much better dropping 44% in its second weekend despite facing the powerful launch of the first Saw pic. Budgeted at $20M, The Grudge 2 looks to reach $40-45M domestically.Faring better in its second term was Robin Williams with his political comedy Man of the Year which declined a moderate 43% to an estimated $7M. Universal has collected a ten-day cume of $22.5M and is heading for $35-40M by the end of its campaign.Sofia Coppola‘s Marie Antoinette got off to a solid start in moderate national release opening to an estimated $5.3M from 859 locations for a sturdy per-theater average of $6,170. The Kirsten Dunst starrer about the former Queen of France played to a young female audience and scored the second best average in the top ten after chart-topper The Prestige. Critics were not too kind to the PG-13 pic.Dropping to ninth was the horror prequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning with an estimated $3.8M, down 49%, lifitng the total up to $36M. Fox’s action pic The Marine rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.7M, off 48%, giving the John Cena flick just $12.5M after ten days. A $20M final seems likely.Disney released its modern classic The Nightmare Before Christmas in special 3D engagements this weekend and posted strong numbers from limited release. The Tim Burton concoction grossed an estimated $3.3M from only 168 theaters for a sizzling $19,536 per venue. The film originally opened in October of 1993 and grossed a solid $50M.The R-rated dysfunctional family pic Running with Scissors got off to a potent start opening in only eight theaters but grossing an estimated $225,000. The Sony release averaged a muscular $28,125 and expands nationally on Friday. Reviews were mixed for the Annette Bening pic.Miramax’s The Queen kept growing and jumped 49% to an estimated $1.5M thanks to an expansion from 46 to 99 playdates. With a stellar average of $15,333 in its fourth frame, the successful widening continued and boosted the total for the acclaimed Helen Mirren film to $3.8M.Four more fall films fell from the top ten this weekend. Buena Vista’s Coast Guard actioner The Guardian took in an estimated $3.6M in its fourth mission, down 39%, for a $46.5M total. The Ashton Kutcher–Kevin Costner pic should conclude with a decent $50-55M. The Jessica Simpson comedy Employee of the Month dropped 45% to an estimated $2.9M giving Lionsgate $23.9M to date. Look for a final tally of around $30M.The historical epic One Night with the King took in an estimated $2.2M in its sophomore frame, down 46%, pushing the ten-day total to just $7.5M. The 8X release may reach about $12M. Paramount’s $12M comedy Jackass: Number Two has grossed a sensational $71.1M thus far after dropping 54% to an estimated $1.5M this weekend. The bold stunts sequel should end up with $74M and lots of profits for its studio.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82M which was up a healthy 25% from last year when Doom debuted at number one with $15.5M; but down 14% from 2004 when The Grudge opened in the top spot with $39.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Prime, TV, the, Tarantino, Disney, psychological, e., ABC, TV, language, Hulu","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Prestige-Defeats-Flags-for-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509158700136","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Penguins and Bond Still Rule Multiplexes","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Penguins and Bond Still Rule Multiplexesby Gitesh Pandya | December 4, 2006 |  CommentsThree new releases failed to make much of an impression on North American moviegoers this weekend as the top films at the box office remained the same.The dynamic duo of the penguin toon \"Happy Feet\" and the James Bond actioner \"Casino Royale\" ranked one and two for the third straight time while Denzel Washington‘s action thriller \"Deja Vu\" found itself in the familiar third spot once again. Overall, the post-turkey blues set in with total ticket sales dropping significantly from last weekend.The animated blockbuster \"Happy Feet\" became only the second film of 2006 to spend three consecutive weekends at number one. Warner Bros. held steady at the top with an estimated $17M over the weekend dropping an understandable 54% from the Thanksgiving holiday frame. After 17 days of release, the penguin hit has grossed a stellar $121M and seems on course to reach the $180-190M domestic range depending on how it holds up over the holidays. The year’s only other film to stay in first place for three weekends was Johnny Depp‘s \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest\" which also happens to be the top-grossing blockbuster of 2006.In its usual runnerup spot was Agent 007 in \"Casino Royale\" which took in an estimated $15.1M in its third mission to boost the total to $115.9M. Off 51%, the Sony hit averaged $4,460 per theater which was virtually the same as Feet’s $4,481 average. \"Casino\" has been holding up better than the last James Bond flick \"Die Another Day\" which grossed less in its third weekend. The new Daniel Craig actioner opened with $40.8M and dropped 25% to $30.8M on Thanksgiving weekend. During the same weeks in 2002, \"Die\" bowed to a stronger $47.1M, but fell a larger 34% to $31M over the turkey frame, and then another 59% to $12.8M on the third session. \"Casino\" was running 7.2% behind \"Die\" after the first ten days but has now cut the margin down to only 3.6%. The new smash looks likely to edge out the previous installment’s $160.9M domestic tally. Worldwide, \"Casino Royale\" surged past the $300M mark in global ticket sales and continues to dominate the international box office.The \"Happy\"-\"Casino\" combo has now grossed a stunning $236.9M putting it slightly ahead of the $229.3M that moviegoers spent a year ago on \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" over the same time period. Factor in the usual 3% for annual ticket price increases and the dollar amount is almost identical. So far, the two hits have tag-teamed to help keep this year’s holiday box office relatively even with last year’s. However, December may struggle to keep up with its 2005 counterpart when movie fans spent a towering $400M on \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" and \"King Kong.\" This month’s upcoming releases will all have to pitch in solid numbers for the marketplace in the final month of the year to keep up with last year.Also not shifting its chart position this weekend was the Denzel Washington actioner \"Deja Vu\" which remained in third place with an estimated $11M. Dropping only 46%, the Buena Vista release watched its cume climb to $44.1M after 12 days. The time-shifting thriller may go on to capture $75-80M.New Line’s Biblical drama \"The Nativity Story\" debuted in fourth place with an estimated $8M from a wide release in 3,183 theaters. Averaging only $2,521 per venue, the PG-rated film was expected to reach double digit millions given its 3,000-plus theater launch just weeks before Christmas. The flashier family blockbuster \"Happy Feet\" may have proven to be too strong of a competitor despite doing $104M in business before \"Nativity\" even opened.The Christmas comedy \"Deck the Halls\" followed with an estimated $6.7M dropping 45% in its second weekend. Fox has stuffed $25M into its stocking after 12 days and could be headed for a mediocre $40-45M final. Another holiday comedy, \"The Santa Clause 3,\" was right behind with an estimated $5M, off 50%, pushing the total for Disney to $73.2M. In seventh was the raunchy pic \"Borat\" which fell 53% to an estimated $4.8M giving Fox a stellar cume of $116.3M.The horror pic \"Turistas\" bowed in eighth place with an estimated $3.5M from 1,570 locations for an average of just $2,255 per site. Fox’s R-rated thriller about American tourists attacked while on vacation in Brazil played to the expected audience of older teens and young adults.Sony’s comedy \"Stranger Than Fiction\" followed with an estimated $3.4M, down 41%, for a cume to date of $36.9M. The Will Ferrell pic’s weekend take included grosses from the studio’s Saturday evening sneak previews of its upcoming Cameron Diaz–Kate Winslet pic \"The Holiday\" which ran at 75% capacity nationwide. The romantic comedy officially opens on Friday against three other new wide openers.Rounding out the top ten was the new college comedy \"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj\" which opened with an estimated $2.3M from 1,979 theaters for an average of only $1,160. The MGM sequel performed much like a pair of recent R-rated comedies aimed at young males — \"Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny\" and \"Let’s Go to Prison\" — which debuted with just $3.2M and $2.2M respectively.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. The DreamWorks animated film \"Flushed Away\" released by Paramount tumbled 61% to an estimated $2.3M in its fifth weekend and raised its total to $60.1M. Look for a $65M final.MGM’s political drama \"Bobby\" fell a steep 59% in its second weekend of national play. The Emilio Estevez pic grossed an estimated $2M lifting the sum to only $9.2M and should end with a weak $12-14M. The Warner Bros. sci-fi romance \"The Fountain\" dropped 57% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $1.6M giving the studio a puny $8.1M in 12 days. A $11-12M final seems likely.The top ten films grossed an estimated $76.9M which was up 5% from last year when \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" remained at number one with $19.9M; and up 2% from 2004 when \"National Treasure\" stayed in the top spot with $17M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"E!, Comics, Binge","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Penguins-and-Bond-Still-Rule-Multiplexes"},{"id":"47509158713456","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Great Success!

Borat #1 in U. S. and A.by Gitesh Pandya | November 5, 2006 |  CommentsAmerica fell in love with Borat this weekend as the underdog movie-film about a TV journalist from Kazakhstan shocked the film industry by opening at number one, despite playing in a fraction of the theaters as Hollywood’s other new offerings.Shattering expectations, the Fox hit surged ahead of two debuting family films that had hoped to capture the box office title — Disney’s Christmas story The Santa Clause 3 and Paramount’s animated comedy Flushed Away.In the year’s biggest box office surprise, the much-talked-about film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan conquered North America grossing an estimated $26.4M in its first weekend beating out all competitors. Playing in only 837 theaters, the R-rated road trip pic averaged a jaw-dropping $31,511 per theater with sell outs from coast to coast. Based on the character created by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat was expected to open with strength in the top five, but was never seen as being powerful enough to reach the number one spot.Fox debuted the raunchy film in moderate national play hoping word-of-mouth would build and help to bolster the second weekend when it would go fully national. Instead, the red hot buzz and heavy doses of media publicity seemed to fuel demand on opening weekend. According to studio research conducted on Friday, the audience for Borat was 55% male and 53% under the age of 25. Fox expects the audience to broaden as women and older adults begin hearing from their friends about the crude laugher. Critics showered the $18M film with nearly universal praise calling it one of the funniest films of all time. This Friday, the studio will triple the number of theaters expanding to as many as 2,500 locations. A domestic gross well north of $100M is assured.Borat began the weekend with a potent $9.2M gross on Friday. Unlike many R-rated cult hits aimed at young males, the Kazakh tale grew on Saturday increasing by 10% to $10.1M. Fox is hoping that many of those who were sold out will return on Sunday to get tickets and is estimating a modest 30% drop to $7.1M for the final day of the frame. Brilliant out-of-the-box marketing on Fox’s part helped to turn a cult character into a can’t-miss blockbuster event thanks to outrageous publicity stunts carefully executed over the past few months which sparked intense curiousity from those unfamiliar with Cohen’s creation. People had to just go and see it to believe it. The road ahead looks glorious thanks to positive word-of-mouth, a sophomore weekend expansion, and the additional wave of free publicity that its surprise top spot debut will generate this week.The opening weekend performance was stunning, but not unique. It matched the results of two other low budget films that attracted widespread media attention from recent years — Michael Moore‘s political documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and the suspense hoax The Blair Witch Project. In June 2004, Fahrenheit also shocked the film biz by debuting at number one with $23.9M from just 868 sites for a stellar $27,558 average. Blair Witch went nationwide after two weeks of very limited play in July 1999 and grossed $29.2M from just 1,101 sites for a colossal $26,528 average landing it in second place. Both films would average about $30,000 per theater at today’s ticket prices. Each film expanded the following weekend and went on to reach a final gross that was five times its opening tally.Overseas, Borat opened day-and-date in Cohen’s native U.K. plus in other European markets with fantastic results. Cultural Learnings grossed an estimated $17M from 17 countries and captured the number one spot in Germany and the U.K. With such great success, Borat will surely not be execute.Settling for second place was The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause which grossed an estimated $20M from 3,458 theaters for an encouraging $5,784 average per venue. The Disney sequel debuted well below the $29M launch of the last installment of the franchise from this same frame in 2002. In Escape, Martin Short joins the cast playing the sinister Jack Frost who is out to ruin Christmas. Disney ruled the box office over the first weekend of November for four of the last five years with its family films. Tim Allen‘s latest G-rated turn as Kris Kringle was expected to be at the top of the charts this time too, but the phenomenon that is Borat was just too much. Competition from Flushed Away also split the family audence in two contributing to Santa’s lower-than-expected weekend bow. Reviews were mostly negative.Opening close behind in third place was the computer-animated toon Flushed Away with an estimated $19.1M from an ultrawide 3,707 theaters. Averaging a good $5,152 per site, the PG-rated pic follows the adventures of a domesticated pet mouse flushed into the underground world of a sewer rat. Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, and Kate Winslet provide the voices. The Paramount release was produced by DreamWorks and Aardman Animations who previously made Chicken Run and last fall’s Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Flushed exceeded the respective openings of $17.5M and $16M for those two films and earned strong praise from critics. Despite competition from Santa, the sewer pic opened impressively and slightly above expectations.The long-term race between the two kidpics will be an interesting one to watch given the similar openings. Flushed should benefit from better word-of-mouth, however Santa’s Christmas theme could help it stay relevant as the holidays approach. Most yuletide pics debuting in early November have had very good legs with some rebounding over the Thanksgiving frame.With three new films getting all the attention, last week’s champ Saw III got shoved down to fourth place with an estimated $15.5M in its second weekend. The Lionsgate horror sequel tumbled an understandable 54% and raised its ten-day cume to a bloody $60.1M. The latest chapter in the highly successful torture series suffered a larger drop than its predessor Saw II which fell 47% in its sophomore session on its way to an identical ten-day gross before ending its run with $87M. Budgeted at $12M, Saw III looks to depreciate at a faster pace and could be headed for a finish of about $80-85M.Two former number one hits holding up with great strength followed in the five and six slots with a slender weekend decline of 19% each. Martin Scorsese scored only the second $100M blockbuster of his career over the weekend with The Departed which in its fifth round took in an estimated $8M. The Warner Bros. hit lifted its total to $102.3M and joined the director’s last film The Aviator ($102.6M) as his only films to reach nine digits in North America. The Leonardo DiCaprio–Matt Damon crime saga also became the 13th film of 2006 to cross the century mark matching the number of blockbusters at this same point last year. Buena Vista’s The Prestige grossed an estimated $7.8M in its third weekend pushing its cume to $39.4M.Clint Eastwood‘s war story Flags of Our Fathers expanded by another 185 theaters in its third mission and grossed an estimated $4.5M from 2,375 locations for a weak $1,895 average. The Paramount release saw its weekend take drop by 29% and its average decline by 35% putting the cume at a disappointing $26.6M. The Robin Williams comedy Man of the Year followed in eighth place with an estimated $3.8M, off only 19%, giving the Universal release $34M to date.Sony’s toon Open Season got hurt by the new family films and dropped 47% to an estimated $3.1M in its sixth hunt pushing the sum to $81.4M. Miramax’s awards contender The Queen finally popped into the top ten at number ten with an estimated $3M. The Helen Mirren film expanded from 152 to 387 theaters and averaged a solid $7,778 per location. The Queen has seen its theater count and gross climb each week and has now lifted its cume to $10.1M with much more still to go.Opening with sensational results in platform release was Pedro Almodovar’s newest story Volver which bowed to an estimated $202,000 from only five sites for a scorching $40,400 average. Sony Classics released the Spanish-language drama in only three New York and two Los Angeles locations and will expand to other cities in the weeks to come. Penelope Cruz, who is already establishing herself as a serious candidate against frontrunner Helen Mirren in the Oscar race for Best Actress, plays a young woman connecting with the spirit of her deceased mother.Paramount Vantage generated terrific numbers with the expansion of its cross-continent drama Babel which grossed an estimated $918,000 from 35 theaters for a potent $26,242 average. The Brad Pitt–Cate Blanchett film widened from 7 theaters in New York and Los Angeles last weekend to thirteen additional markets this weekend. Babel opens nationally on Friday in over 1,200 total theaters going head-to-head with four other new wide releases plus the further expansion of Borat. Cume sits at $1.5M.The Dixie Chicks doc Shut Up and Sing widened from four to nine theaters in its second weekend and grossed an estimated $78,000. The Weinstein Co. release averaged a solid $8,613 and put its total at $146,000.Four films, including a trio of Sony titles, dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Fox’s family drama Flicka grossed an estimated $2.7M, down 43%, for a $17.6M total. The $14M girl-and-her-horse pic should conclude with a not-so-dazzling $22-24M. Sony’s period pic Marie Antoinette slipped only 19% to an estimated $2.3M but its cume reached a mere $13M after 17 days. Look for a weak $20M final.The studio’s dysfunctional family flick Running with Scissors fell 35% and took in an estimated $1.7M after its second weekend of national play. With a puny $5.3M in the bank, the Annette Bening comedy should sputter to a dismal $9M. Sony’s fright sequel The Grudge 2 has scared up a decent $38M to date. The $20M franchise film looks headed for a domestic finish of about $40M or so. Though profitable, the sequel will end up grossing only about one-third of the $110.2M of Sarah Michelle Gellar‘s first Grudge pic from two years ago.The top ten films grossed an estimated $111.2M which was down 4% from last year when Chicken Little debuted at number one with $40M; and down 16% from 2004 when The Incredibles opened in the top spot with $70.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"free, Christmas, FXX, blaxploitation, what, Fantasy, telelvision, Character, America, sequels, Returns","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Great-Success-Borat-1-in-U-S-and-A"},{"id":"47509158705259","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Turkey Frame Stuffed With New Movies","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Turkey Frame Stuffed With New Moviesby Gitesh Pandya | November 23, 2006 |  CommentsHappy Turkey Day! A crowded marketplace gets even more packed as six new films open or expand nationally over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.New films bowing on Wednesday include the action pic Deja Vu, the Christmas comedy Deck the Halls, the rock music comedy Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, and the sci-fi romance The Fountain.Expanding nationwide are the political drama Bobby and the ensemble comedy For Your Consideration. Despite all the new releases, last weekend’s two big openers – the animated penguin flick Happy Feet and the James Bond adventure Casino Royale – will try to hold onto their positions atop the charts. With something for everyone, the overall holiday box office should be robust.Nearly a dozen years after teaming up for the hit submarine thriller Crimson Tide, Denzel Washington, director Tony Scott, and superproducer Jerry Bruckheimer join forces once again for Deja Vu. The PG-13 pic finds the Oscar-winning actor playing an ATF agent investigating the bombing of a New Orleans ferry which kills over 500 innocent people. To make this stand out from other scripts, a sci-fi element is added that gives investigators the possibility of preventing the tragedy from ever happening in the first place. Bruckheimer and Scott know how to please action-seeking movie fans. From Top Gun, to Tide, to Enemy of the State, the duo has scored many blockbusters over the past two decades.Denzel is a bankable star, especially in a law enforcement role in an action film. His recent openings for gritty action pics include $29M for this year’s Inside Man, $22.8M for 2004’s Man on Fire, and $22.6M for 2001’s Training Day. Deja Vu should play to most of the same fans, however its biggest challenge will come from competing action film Casino Royale which is still new and getting positive marks. A holiday frame as big as Thanksgiving will usually expand to handle both choices so there may be room to breathe, but there will certainly be some adults interested in both who only get time to see one. Buena Vista’s marketing push has been solid and reviews are even favorable. Debuting in 3,108 theaters, Deja Vu might open to around $23M over three days and about $34M over the long Wednesday-to-Sunday period.Fox offers up a new Christmas comedy for family audiences with Deck the Halls starring Danny DeVito and Matthew Broderick. The PG-rated pic finds two dads with two different styles of holiday cheer going to battle over Christmas light decorations. The studio is hoping to pick up business from family audiences that are in a holiday mood and have already seen Tim Allen‘s The Santa Clause 3. But Happy Feet, which opened only five days before Deck, will be a major competitor since it is a more high profile kidpic with a louder marketing campaign. Deck looks to play to the same audience as last Thanksgiving’s Yours, Mine and Ours which debuted to $17.5M with $24.3M over five days. Deck has the starpower to grab some attention, but will have more direct competition. Landing in 3,023 sites, Deck the Halls might collect around $14M over the Friday-to-Sunday span and roughly $19M over five days.Funnyman Jack Black goes into vanity-project mode with the new comedy Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny which teams him with his musical partner Kyle Gass. The New Line release will appeal mostly to young males but with its R rating, many younger fans will have trouble buying a ticket. The rating should serve as a major strike against its commercial potential. Female appeal also does not seem too high so Destiny will play to a very specific audience. Expanding beyond Tenacious D fans will be difficult. Black’s last starring role was in the summer wrestling comedy Nacho Libre which opened to $28.3M thanks in part to its PG rating which let all the 12-year-olds in.Films like Let’s Go To Prison and Harsh Times learned in recent weeks that R-rated films aimed at young men can struggle at the box office. Both of those bowed to about $2M each. Pick has more starpower which should help its cause plus the busy turkey frame when college guys are all out of class. Those not busy playing their PlayStation 3, might rock out with JB and KG. Opening in 1,919 locations, Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny may debut with about $8M and $13M over five days.The good thing about having an endless line of stars like in the political drama Bobby is that the studio can have a different actor plug the film on every major talk show simultaneously. That’s what MGM is finding out this week with the Emilio Estevez picture which expands nationally on Thursday from two exclusive engagements to 1,667 sites from sea to shining sea. Last weekend, the R-rated story behind the day that Robert Kennedy was assassinated averaged a potent $34,519 per theater from its solo houses in New York and Los Angeles. But how will it play across all 50 states? Certainly Bobby will appeal to an older crowd that remembers the 1960s and to a smart upscale audience not looking for Bond or Denzel to save the day. Reviews have generally been good, but critics have not been overwhelming in their praise. As a national candidate, Bobby could collect about $7M over three days and about $10M over five days.Movie fans in search of the fountain of youth get to try out The Fountain, a time-travel adventure from writer/director Darren Aronofsky (pi). Hugh Jackman stars as a man determined to save the woman he loves, played by Rachel Weisz, and will cross a thousand years of time in order to do so. If marketing support is any indicator, this PG-13 entry is a low priority for Warner Bros. Awareness is not very high and its target audience of adults has many other options to choose from. Critics have not been too supportive either. Debuting in 1,472 theaters, The Fountain could open with around $4M and a five-day tally of $6M.Also expanding nationally after a strong start in limited play is the film industry comedy For Your Consideration which widens from 23 to 623 locations on Wednesday. The Warner Independent release enters a very crowded marketplace and will find it tough to bring in ticket buyers outside of the Christopher Guest fan club. Last weekend, the PG-13 film posted a stellar $16,174 average, but even acclaimed films like Babel have found out that gunning for smart adult audiences is one hard task. Look for a weekend gross of about $3M.Last weekend’s two chart-toppers will try to fend off competition from the new releases to hang on to their gold and silver medals. Warner Bros. may sit at the head of the dinner table once again with its animated penguin hit Happy Feet which narrowly won the weekend race last frame. Kid movies always do well over Thanksgiving and this should be no exception. Holdover films have ruled the holiday all decade long with 1999’s Toy Story 2 being the last new release to open at number one over this particular holiday weekend.With so many films opening or expanding over the turkey frame, direct competition for Feet will only come from Deck the Halls and The Santa Clause 3 which should see its weekend gross rise as most Christmas-themed films do over Thanksgiving. A 25% drop for Happy Feet would give the toon about $31M over three days and a ten-day cume of $91M.The James Bond actioner Casino Royale might slip a little more in its sophomore frame. In 2002, Die Another Day dropped 34% against no new competition in its second session which was also the turkey holiday. Casino will face a serious direct threat from Deja Vu, however it seems to be pleasing audiences more than Die did. That could lead to a similar 35% decline to around $26M giving the new Daniel Craig adventure $88M in ten days.Fox looks to crack the $100M mark with Borat this weekend. The raunchy comedy is phasing out at the box office, but non-frequent moviegoers may take a trip this weekend to catch up on one of the most-talked-about films of the year. A 35% drop to around $9.5M could occur giving Borat a hefty $107M in 24 days.LAST YEAR: Wizard power ruled the turkey frame as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire remained at number one with $54.7M over three days falling 47% from its debut. That gave Warner Bros. a staggering $201M in only ten days. Fox’s Johnny Cash film Walk the Line held steady in second place with $19.2M but slipped only 14% from its opening. Paramount opened its holiday family comedy Yours, Mine, and Ours in third place with $17.5M in three days and $24.3M over the long five-day holiday period. It reached $53.4M overall. Disney’s Chicken Little placed fourth with $12.6M, down 15% in its fourth frame. Sony’s musical Rent rounded out the top five bowing to $10M and $17.1M over five days. A final gross of $29.1M resulted. Other new releases over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend posted more modest numbers. New Line’s comedy Just Friends opened to $9.2M on its way to $32.6M. Lionsgate launched the drama In The Mix to $4.4M leading to a $10.2M end. And the caper pic The Ice Harvest debuted to $3.7M on its way to only $9M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"service, crime, X-Men, Schedule, Sabrina, San, Comedy, jurassic, ID, mutant, Mary, biography, marvel, facebook","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Turkey-Frame-Stuffed-With-New-Movies"},{"id":"47509160145011","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Saw III Brings The Pain","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Saw III Brings The Painby Gitesh Pandya | October 26, 2006 |  CommentsBlood will flow and screams will be deafening at North American multiplexes this weekend when the horror sequel \"Saw III\" buzzes its way into theaters. While there will be no fight for the number one spot, the rest of the top ten will see new films and holdovers scrambling for high positions.The political thriller \"Catch a Fire\" opens on Friday in moderate national release and the comedy \"Running with Scissors\" expands into major markets after an impressive debut in limited release last weekend. Meanwhile, star-driven pics \"The Prestige\" and \"The Departed\" will try to remain popular choices with adult moviegoers.If it’s Halloween, it must be \"Saw.\" That’s the tagline that Lionsgate hopes will keep horror fans coming back for a third helping of pain for the newest chapter in its highly profitable fright franchise, \"Saw III.\" The R-rated film finds Jigsaw returning to terrorize another set of young people. Once again, the formula of no stars plus extreme brutality unleashing its fury on the weekend before the pumpkin holiday remains intact. Now a major player in the horror genre, Lionsgate opened its first \"Saw\" in 2004 to the tune of $18.3M and grew its audience over the following year, especially with DVD, to propel the sequel to a $31.7M bow. Over the last 15 months, no other R-rated film has opened better. Now, a marketplace without many exciting choices for the 17-30 age group will embrace a film, though familiar, that appeals to young adults.Another unfortunate dude opens \"Saw III.\"This month has already seen a pair of horror franchise pics open weaker than their predecessors which bowed in mid-October of recent years. \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning\" debuted to $18.5M, down 34% from the $28.1M of 2003’s \"Massacre,\" and \"The Grudge 2\" launched with $20.8M, a steep 47% less than the Gellar original. But \"Saw III\" is in a different situation. \"Beginning\" was a prequel three years later with not much new to offer while \"Grudge 2\" was no longer a star vehicle. \"Saw III\" promises more of what its fans want – brutality, gore, and torture – so it stands on almost equal footing when compared to the last installment. The fan base has probably not grown much in the last twelve months and some might even drop out thinking it’s just the same offering yet again. But with competing fright flicks fading fast, \"Saw III\" will basically be the only horror film in town for those getting ready for Halloween. Opening in over 3,000 theaters, \"Saw III\" might cut up around $30M.Tim Robbins plays an elite South African leader and Derek Luke stars as an oppressed everyman in the apartheid drama \"Catch a Fire.\" Directed by Phillip Noyce (\"Patriot Games, \"Clear and Present Danger\"), the PG-13 political thriller tells the true story of a man captured and tortured by his government, only to become a radical freedom fighter for his people. Focus is likely to attract an audience similar to the one it saw last fall with another African-set political pic, \"The Constant Gardener.\" The Ralph Fiennes–Rachel Weisz film boasted a similar level of starpower and screens when it bowed to $8.7M over three days from 1,346 locations for a solid $6,444 average.Derek Luke in the inspirational \"Catch a Fire.\"Reviews for \"Fire\" have been generally positive, but it will not be an easy sell at the box office. Robbins is the top star here and his track record selling tickets is spotty when it comes to films where he is the solo anchor. Plus the marketplace is filled with pictures targeting mature adults like \"The Departed,\" \"The Prestige,\" and \"Flags of Our Fathers\" so a crowded field will make it tough for \"Fire.\" Using the ‘based on a true story’ angle in the marketing is always a helpful thing and Focus will soon see how much mileage it can get from it. Attacking 1,305 locations, \"Catch a Fire\" might capture about $6M over the Friday-to-Sunday session.Annette Bening‘s dysfunctional family pic \"Running with Scissors\" enjoyed a strong platform debut last weekend with a scorching $28,263 average from only six sites. This Friday, Sony hopes to build on its bow by expanding the R-rated film into 586 theaters across North America. Critics agree that \"Scissors\" is not the next \"Little Miss Sunshine.\" Reviews have been unflattering which will limit the commercial potential of a film that will mostly play to upscale adult audiences. A weekend take of around $3M could result diluting the per-theater average down to the neighborhood of $5,000.Annette Bening and Brian Cox in \"Running With Scissors.\"Arthouses continue to get more crowded with fall films hoping for critical buzz and possible awards attention. Paramount Vantage packs the most starpower with its Brad Pitt–Cate Blanchett drama \"Babel\" which took home Best Director honors at Cannes this year for Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (\"Amores Perros,\" \"21 Grams\"). The R-rated tale trots across the globe from Morocco to Mexico to Japan with four interweaving stories about people from around the world who have no idea how connected their lives are. \"Babel\" opens in just six locations in New York and Los Angeles, most of them major multiplexes, and expands nationally in November. Reviews have been solid.Brad Pitt, in the oscar-buzz grabber \"Babel.\"With Election Day around the corner, President George W. Bush stars in two documentaries that will try to stir up some controversy in order to get audiences running to their local theater. Newmarket Films releases \"Death of a President,\" a docudrama about the fictional assassination of Bush in October 2007 and its aftermath. The R-rated whodunit was one of the hottest films at the Toronto Film Festival last month and hopes to capitalize on its buzz when it invades over 100 theaters this Friday. Also trying to wage a Red State vs. Blue State rivalry is \"Shut Up &amp; Sing\" which examines the hardships that The Dixie Chicks faced recording their new album after their public outcry against the current Commander-in-Chief. The Weinstein Company opens the film in New York and Los Angeles on Friday before expanding to much of the country on November 10.\"D.O.A.P\"Among holdovers, the period thriller \"The Prestige\" and the mob drama \"The Departed\" should remain popular contenders in the top five. \"Saw III\" should not detract from either pic too much and the frame’s other new films will not play wide enough to offer significant competition in the rankings. \"Prestige\" swiped the top spot last weekend and is well-liked by moviegoers. A 40% drop would give Buena Vista about $9M and a ten-day total of $28M. \"The Departed\" has been holding up superbly so another 30% dip would leave Warner Bros. with around $9.5M which could be good enough for a third consecutive weekend at number two. The cume would rise to $90M.LAST YEAR: Doing what its predecessor couldn’t do, \"Saw II\" opened triumphantly at number one and grossed a sturdy $31.7M for Lionsgate on its way to $87M continuing its most popular horror franchise. Sony countered with its family friendly adventure sequel \"The Legend of Zorro\" which debuted in second place with a decent $16.3M. The pricey Antonio Banderas–Catherine Zeta-Jones pic went on to reach just $45.4M domestically. Meryl Streep and Uma Thurman quietly bowed in third with the comedy \"Prime\" which opened to $6.2M from less than 2,000 theaters. Universal found its way to a $22.8M final. The horse flick \"Dreamer\" held up well in its second jump taking in $6.1M while fellow kidpic \"Wallace &amp; Gromit\" rounded out the top five with $4.3M in its fourth weekend. The fourth new wide release of the frame, Nicolas Cage‘s \"The Weather Man,\" got rained out collecting a mere $4.2M leading to a wimpy $12.5M finish.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"documentary, PlayStation, media, Captain, Legendary, TBS","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Saw-III-Brings-The-Pain"},{"id":"47509158701161","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Nativity\" Leads Trio of New Releases","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Nativity\" Leads Trio of New Releasesby Gitesh Pandya | November 30, 2006 |  CommentsThe post-turkey blues will kick in as the North American box office should slump this weekend following a busy Thanksgiving holiday frame.Three new releases venture into the multiplexes. The Biblical drama \"The Nativity Story\" will open in the most theaters and try to court a faith-based audience as Christmas nears. Teens and young adults looking to push the envelope with R-rated fare have the college comedy \"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj\" and the horror thriller \"Turistas.\" Meanwhile, the penguin toon \"Happy Feet\" and the James Bond actioner \"Casino Royale\" will both be past the $100M mark by Friday and will try to stay atop the charts for a third straight time.The story of Baby Jesus comes to the big screen with New Line’s \"The Nativity Story\" which stars Keisha Castle-Hughes (\"Whale Rider\") as Mary. The PG-rated film should appeal to Christian parents wanting to share the religious saga with their children in an environment that the whole family can enjoy. Certainly \"The Passion of the Christ\" showed how big a Biblical film could be at the box office. However, \"Nativity\" is completely different and does not have that film’s high-profile director, controversy, or national media frenzy.Keisha Castle-Hughes and friends in \"The Nativity Story.\"Instead, it may tap into the same audience as October’s Babylon epic \"One Night With the King\" which opened to $4.1M from just 909 theaters for a $4,518 average. \"The Nativity Story\" will launch in more than twice the number of theaters and has a more timely release with December 25 right around the corner, but could generate a similar per-theater average. Critics have not been kind to the pic which might prompt some to wait for the DVD. Opening in around 2,800 theaters, \"The Nativity Story\" could collect about $13M over the weekend.Four and a half years after the release of National Lampoon’s first raunchy college comedy \"Van Wilder\" comes a new installment with \"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj.\" This R-rated tale finds Taj (Kal Penn) from the first film moving to England to teach a group of misfits how to party down. It’s been a tough road in recent weeks for R-rated films aimed at young males. \"Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny,\" \"Let’s Go to Prison,\" and \"Harsh Times\" all opened with about $2M or $3M a piece. \"Taj\" has some brand recognition since the first \"Van Wilder\" went on to become popular on video and on cable. In theaters, it opened to $7.3M and a $3,612 average in April 2002 leading to a $21M final. However, a crowded marketplace will make it tough for the sequel to stand out. And \"Borat\" becoming a runaway smash with four straight $10M+ weekends won’t help either. Opening in 2,000 around theaters, \"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj\" might debut with about $5M.Kal Penn returns in \"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj.\"Fox’s new division Fox Atomic, which will cater to teen and young adult audiences, sets sail with its first film with the horror pic \"Turistas.\" The R-rated thriller is directed by John Stockwell (\"Blue Crush,\" \"Crazy/Beautiful\") and follows a group of American tourists on vacation in Brazil who cross paths with creepy organ harvesters. No starpower here. Instead, Fox is hoping to appeal to college kids looking for a good scare. Outside of older teens and twentysomethings, appeal should be minimal. Even with its core audience, \"Turistas\" will have to share shelf space with \"Taj\" so potential will be limited. Opening in less than 2,000 theaters, \"Turistas\" could find its way to a weekend gross of roughly $4M.A trio of scared turistas in \"Turistas.\"Among holdovers, films usually suffer steep declines on the weekend after the Thanksgiving holiday frame. Overall box office spending contracts and studios usually avoid programming any of their heavy hitters into the slot. In fact in the last 15 years, only one new release has opened at number one during this particular weekend – 2003’s \"The Last Samurai.\"This weekend, it could end up being \"Happy Feet\" and \"Casino Royale\" duking it out for box office supremacy for the third straight time. Family pics do extremely well over the turkey frame, but then come down hard a week later. Plus \"The Nativity Story\" could provide some competition for families. Warner Bros. might suffer a 55% fall for its penguin film which would leave it with $17M for the weekend and $120M after 17 days.The new blonde Bond is pleasing audiences worldwide and in the United States, \"Casino Royale\" is set to give \"Die Another Day\" a run for its money thanks to good word-of-mouth. With kids back in school, the Sony adventure film has taken over the number one spot during the mid-week period. \"Casino\" could drop by 50% this weekend to around $15M which would push the domestic cume to $116M. Look for the global tally to surpass the $400M mark with ease by the end of the holiday season.Last weekend, Denzel Washington‘s action thriller \"Deja Vu\" got off to a good start with a $28.6M five-day bow. Buena Vista may witness a 50% drop and collect roughly $10M over three days and raise its 12-day total to $43M.LAST YEAR: For the third straight weekend, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" rose to the head of the class and grossed $19.9M to lead the box office. Paramount opened its Charlize Theron actioner \"Aeon Flux\" to $12.7M on its way to a lukewarm $25.9M. It was the only new wide release of the weekend. \"Walk the Line\" dropped to third with $9.5M, \"Yours, Mine, and Ours\" placed fourth with $8.3M, and \"Just Friends\" rounded out the top five with $5.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"hidden, scary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Nativity-Leads-Trio-of-New-Releases"},{"id":"47509161691268","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Invincible\" Scores #1 Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Invincible\" Scores #1 Openingby Gitesh Pandya | August 27, 2006 |  CommentsFootball season was back in swing at the North American box office this weekend as Disney’s real-life pigskin drama \"Invincible\" scored a number-one opening by more than doubling the ticket sales of its nearest competitor. The rest of the films in the top ten were packed into a tight range and were separated by a mere $2.6M meaning chart positions could change when final numbers are released on Monday. The frame’s other newcomers — the raunchy comedy \"Beerfest,\" the music-driven drama \"Idlewild,\" and the kidpic \"How to Eat Fried Worms\" — all generated more modest grosses in their debuts. Overall, the marketplace slumped to levels typical of the last weekend of August.Wahlberg went from mixing cocktails to playing football in \"Invincible.\"Mark Wahlberg was the most valuable player this weekend as his new football pic \"Invincible\" easily beat all foes and grossed an estimated $17M over the weekend finishing in first place. Averaging a solid $5,838 from 2,917 theaters, the PG-rated pic tells the true story of a 30-year-old bartender who landed a spot on the roster of the Philadelphia Eagles. Disney set up a sizable marketing campaign with the NFL promoting \"Invincible\" during the current pre-season and it seemed to have paid off handsomely. Reviews were generally favorable for the feel-good drama.\"Talladega Nights\" still going strong.Sony’s hit NASCAR comedy \"Talladega Nights\" stayed put in second place again with an estimated $8M in its fourth lap. The Will Ferrell smash dropped 42% and upped its cume to $127.7M making it the summer’s second biggest comedy.to date after Adam Sandler’s \"Click\" ($136M) which was also a Sony release. \"Talladega\" could race past \"Click\" by Labor Day.Making its way up to the number three position was Fox Searchlight’s hit road comedy \"Little Miss Sunshine\" which more than doubled its theater count and grossed an estimated $7.5M from 1,430 sites. The R-rated pic averaged a solid $5,245 and boosted its cume to $23M. \"Sunshine\" has steadily grown over the past month into a pop culture phenomenon becoming the \"it\" movie of the moment and looks certain to charm its way past the $50M mark domestically in the weeks ahead.Beer pong, a \"sport\" more fun playing than watching.Another R-rated laugher followed in fourth. The new Warner Bros. comedy \"Beerfest\" debuted with an estimated $6.5M from 2,964 playdates for a mild $2,193 average. The Broken Lizard concoction opened much like the comedy troupe’s 2002 hit \"Super Troopers\" which bowed to $6.2M over three days on its way to $18.5M. \"Beerfest\" tells of a group of American beer chuggers who must train and compete in a secret drinking tournament in Germany.Sam Jackson calling in to find out where the audience for \"Snakes\" went.Yet another comedy followed with a similar estimate of $6.5M in ticket sales. Universal’s \"Accepted\" dropped only 35% and upped its ten-day total to a respectable $21.1M. Fellow sophomore \"Snakes on a Plane\" was an inch behind with an estimated $6.4M tumbling 58% in its second weekend. Total stands at $26.6M. Final grosses look to reach $36-39M each.Paramount’s \"World Trade Center\" fell 41% to an estimated $6.4M putting its sum at $55.6M. Buena Vista’s dance drama \"Step Up\" captured an estimated $6.2M, off 39%, for a $50.4M total.Universal’s music-filled drama \"Idlewild\" bowed in ninth place but generated the best average in the top ten. The OutKast pic grossed an estimated $5.9M from only 973 locations for a solid $6,055 average. Studio research showed that 55% of the audience was over age 30, 61% was female, and 82% was African American.Rounding out the top ten was Paramount’s animated comedy \"Barnyard\" with an estimated $5.4M in its fourth weekend. Down only 28%, the PG-rated toon has taken in an encouraging $54.7M to date.Debuting poorly just outside the top ten was New Line’s kidpic \"How to Eat Fried Worms\" with an estimated $4M from 1,870 sites for an average of only $2,112 per theater. Yari Film Group widened its period mystery \"The Illusionist\" and grossed an estimated $1.8M from just 144 theaters for a strong $12,688 per venue. Cume is $3.2M and the Edward Norton–Paul Giamatti drama will go national on Friday.\"Pirates\" is gold for Disney.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. The summer juggernaut \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest\" enjoyed a seven-week run in the top ten, but dipped to an estimated $4M this weekend for a slim decline of only 23%. With a colossal $407.6M from North America alone, the Johnny Depp adventure surpassed \"Spider-Man\" ($403.7M in 2002) to claim the number six spot on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters. Chest looks to reach about $420M stateside. Worldwide, the \"Pirates\" sequel is closing in on an astounding one billion dollars in global box office.The teen comedy \"Material Girls\" starring Hilary and Haylie Duff dropped by 50% to an estimated $2.3M in its sophomore session. The MGM title has collected just $8.5M in ten days and should end up with around $13M before finding a bigger audience on DVD. The horror flick \"Pulse\" grossed an estimated $1.7M, down 53%, for a total of $17.9M. A final tally of about $21M could result.ThinkFilm’s drug-addicted teacher drama \"Half Nelson\" expanded from three to 21 theaters and grossed an estimated $210,000 for a strong $10,000 average. Cume is now $389,000. Fox Searchlight’s relationship film \"Trust the Man\" did not have as much luck during its expansion. The David Duchovny–Julianne Moore pic grossed an estimated $285,000 from 158 sites (up from 38 last weekend) and averaged a poor $1,804. Total is $541,000 with another widening up to 300 theaters set for Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $75.8M which was off 2% from last year when \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" remained at number one with $16.3M; and down 4% from 2004 when \"Hero\" opened in the top spot with $18M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"history, thriller, A24","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Invincible-Scores-1-Opening"},{"id":"47509161689219","title":"Box Office Preview: \"Crank\" Closes Up Summer Movie Season","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: \"Crank\" Closes Up Summer Movie Seasonby Gitesh Pandya | August 31, 2006 |  CommentsThe summer movie season comes to an official end with the Labor Day holiday weekend unleashing three new releases plus the national expansion of a fourth.Lionsgate offers the action crowd \"Crank,\" Warner Bros. provides the suspense thriller \"The Wicker Man,\" Sony takes a shot with the basketball drama \"Crossover,\" and Yari Film Group goes nationwide with its period thriller \"The Illusionist.\" Each is hoping that current champ \"Invincible\" will fumble the ball. The summer-ending frame is often a time when moviegoers catch up on hit films they haven’t seen yet so notable holdovers could see their four-day grosses grow beyond their three-day takes from last weekend. Overall, the marketplace remains overcrowded with too many films fighting to get a slice of the box office pie.British action star Jason Statham attacks the U.S. for the second Labor Day weekend in a row with his latest pic \"Crank.\" Co-starring Amy Smart, the Lionsgate release sees the actor playing a poisoned hitman who must keep his adrenaline up in order to stay alive. Unlike his PG-13 \"Transporter\" flicks, \"Crank\" carries a more restrictive R rating which could narrow its target audience. It’s been a tough summer for R-rated action films with movies like \"Snakes on a Plane\" and \"Miami Vice\" both underperforming. But if there’s any distributor who can successfully target young adult males with these types of films with intriguing concepts, it’s the \"Saw\" studio.Jason Statham showing off his dramatic range\"Snakes\" was the only pure action film in the top ten last weekend so competition for \"Crank\" may not be too fierce. Statham has seen his starpower grow in the last couple of years and that might benefit his latest pic too. Still, the marquees are jam packed with choices this weekend so it will be tough to fight off other films and convince moviegoers that their time and money should be best spent here. A year ago this weekend, \"Transporter 2\" opened at number one with a four-day tally of $20.1M. However, that Fox pic was a sequel, had a less restrictive rating, and bowed in 900 more theaters. Given \"Crank’s\" debut in about 2,400 locations, it could end up with around $13M over the long Friday-to-Monday period.With his twin towers drama still in the top ten, Nicolas Cage hits the big screen for the second time in a month with the psychological thriller \"The Wicker Man.\" The PG-13 film stars the Oscar-winning actor as a cop investigating a cult while looking for a missing girl. Labor Day weekend has been a good time for creepy thrillers, especially for ones that appeal to high school and college students like the \"Jeepers Creepers\" pics. \"Wicker Man’s\" rating will help its cause, but whether it can excite teens will determine how big it can become. With a half-dozen production companies, six producers, and seven executive producers all involved, it’s hard to say if this is really director Neil LaBute‘s film. Warner Bros. has given \"Wicker\" a decent marketing push, but it has not become a must-see thriller. A marketplace flooded with pictures will provide plenty of competition for adults and this one will have to work extra hard to stand out in the crowd. Ending a disappointing summer for the studio, \"The Wicker Man\" bows in over 2,500 theaters and could scare up around $12M over the four-day period.Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn in \"The Wicker Man\"Sony goes after the urban youth audience with its new basketball drama \"Crossover\" which finds two young streetballers competing in the world of underground hoops. The PG-13 film is getting a moderate release in 1,023 theaters which will limit its potential, however a solid per-theater average could result. Compared to reigning box office champ \"Invincible,\" this new sports drama will attract a much more ethnic audience and should play primarily to teens and young adults. \"Idlewild\" will provide some competition for African American moviegoers, however the OutKast pic is playing to an older audience. With Anthony Mackie, Wesley Jonathan, and Wayne Brady heading up the cast, \"Crossover\" does not offer up much starpower. But it could be a short-term choice for the back-to-school crowd in urban markets. Over the Friday-to-Monday holiday span, \"Crossover\" might shoot up about $5M.The first rule of underground streetball is…After two weeks of strong results in limited release, the period mystery \"The Illusionist\" expands wide from 144 theaters to approximately 1,000 sites across North America. One of the summer’s best-reviewed films, the Edward Norton–Paul Giamatti drama opened in 51 theaters with a powerful $18,195 average and widened on its second frame scoring a still-potent $12,745 average. Glowing praise from critics and solid word-of-mouth could help sell \"The Illusionist\" to moviegoers who would not ordinarily buy tickets to a film with these stars. Competition will be tough, though. For only the second time all year, ten films surpassed $5M last weekend and most are looking to remain relevant over the holiday session. \"The Illusionist\" could capture the same amount over four days this weekend pushing its cume to about $9M.Those illusionists get all the chicksMore new movies enter into limited release on Friday. IFC Films unveils the documentary \"This Film is Not Yet Rated\" in exclusive engagements in New York and Los Angeles. The unrated film (it was given an NC-17, but is going out with no official rating) explores the mystery behind the movie ratings system as determined by the Motion Picture Association of America. Writer/director Ed Burns returns to theaters as a private investigator searching for a missing woman in \"Looking for Kitty.\" The R-rated drama is being released in one solo New York house by ThinkFilm.Last weekend, Mark Wahlberg‘s football drama \"Invincible\" scored a number one opening and was the only film to attract more than $10M in ticket sales over the frame. Word of mouth has been good and the Disney release would like nothing more than to land another win over the holiday session. The four-day gross might see only a small drop from last weekend’s three-day bow. A decline to about $15M would give \"Invincible\" a total of $38M after 11 days.Labor Day weekend has historically been a great time for hot late-summer indie films to reach out to broader audiences and \"Little Miss Sunshine\" hopes to be the latest one to capitalize on its buzz. Four-day increases over the previous three-day weekends in recent years have included 17% for \"March of the Penguins\" last year, 35% for \"Garden State\" in 2004, 80% for \"Napoleon Dynamite\" that same year, and a whopping 104% for \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" in 2002. That PG-rated blockbuster added about 300 theaters over the holiday frame while the R-rated \"Sunshine\" will only increase its current count of 1,430 by a hundred or so. The Fox Searchlight hit could charm about $9.5M from ticket buyers over the long weekend and boost its cume to $36M.LAST YEAR Jason Statham ruled the Labor Day weekend box office with the number one opening of his action sequel \"Transporter 2\" which grossed $20.1M over four days. The Fox hit went on to collect $43.1M. The comedy sensation \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" slipped to second place with $16.5M over four days displaying another great hold in its third frame. Debuting in third with $11M was the thriller \"The Constant Gardener\" from Focus which went on to gross $33.6M and become a major awards contender. Rounding out the top five were the DreamWorks suspense flick \"Red Eye\" with $9.4M and Miramax’s adventure pic \"The Brothers Grimm\" with $9M. Two new films opened with weak results outside of the top ten. Miramax’s \"Underclassman\" bowed to $3.1M on its way to $5.7M while Warner Bros. took in just $1.2M for \"A Sound of Thunder\" leading to only a $1.9M final.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"movies, Rock, nfl, finale, LGBTQ, Studios, shows, Endgame, Ice, 2020, comiccon, dark, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Crank-Closes-Up-Summer-Movie-Season"},{"id":"47509161683074","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Invincible Scores Another Win at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Invincible Scores Another Win at #1by Gitesh Pandya | September 5, 2006 |  CommentsMoviegoers had football on their minds for the second straight weekend as Disney’s true-life NFL tale \"Invincible\" remained atop the North American box office over the long Labor Day holiday weekend finishing off another summer movie season. New releases \"Crank\" and \"The Wicker Man\" opened in second and third, respectively, while the critically acclaimed films \"Little Miss Sunshine\" and \"The Illusionist\" both scored strong per-theater averages in moderate release. The holiday frame marked the first weekend in six long months where no new film debuted with at least $15M. Hollywood was happy to close the books on a summer movie season that was slightly better than than last year’s.Retaining its first-place position, Mark Wahlberg‘s \"Invincible\" grossed an estimated $15.2M over the four-day Friday-to-Monday holiday weekend and remained the most popular movie in North America. After 11 days of release, the feel-good drama about a 30-year-old bartender who earned a spot on the Philadelphia Eagles starting lineup has grossed a solid $37.8M and could be headed for the neighborhood of $60-70M.It was only fitting that Disney topped the box office charts as the summer came to an end. Since the summer movie season kicked off on May 5 with \"Mission: Impossible III,\" Buena Vista has grossed $786M at the multiplexes beating out all other studios. Disney’s success was powered by the summer’s two highest grossing hits, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest\" ($414.2M) and \"Cars\" ($242M), but also included surprise late-summer winners like \"Invincible\" and \"Step Up.\" It was a drastic turnaround from last summer when the Mouse House’s biggest film was \"Herbie: Fully Loaded\" with $66M.Opening in second place was action star Jason Statham‘s new thriller \"Crank\" with an estimated $13M over four days from 2,515 theaters. Averaging a commendable $5,169 per site, the R-rated film features a poisoned hitman who will die if he can’t keep his adrenaline up constantly. The Lionsgate release opened better than Statham’s 2002 film \"The Transporter\" ($9.1M in three days) but did not reach the $20.1M bow of his action sequel \"Transporter 2\" which ruled the Labor Day frame a year ago. That number one hit carried a commercially friendly PG-13 rating and kicked its way into 800 more theaters. Over the Friday-to-Sunday span, \"Crank\" grossed $10.3M and averaged $4,095.Nicolas Cage opened his new suspense thriller \"The Wicker Man\" close behind in third place with an estimated $11.7M in ticket sales over the Friday-to-Monday holiday session. The Warner Bros. remake about a cop who investigates a missing girl averaged a mediocre $4,210 from 2,784 theatrs over four days. The PG-13 film grossed $9.6M in three days for a mild average of $3,448. Cage appeared twice in the top ten as his previous film \"World Trade Center\" finished further down in ninth place.Two smaller films successfully expanding into national release followed and scored the best averages among all the wide releases. Fox Searchlight’s road comedy \"Little Miss Sunshine\" ranked fourth for the weekend with an estimated $9.7M over four days with $7.6M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion. It was the second weekend in a row that actor Greg Kinnear had two films in the top five. He plays a supporting role in \"Invincible\" as well. \"Sunshine\" averaged a strong $6,071 from 1,602 theaters over four days pushing its total to $35.8M and counting. At its current rate, it should eventually surpass \"Miami Vice\" as the top-grossing R-rated film to come out of the summer.Rookie distributor Yari Film Group did an excellent job expanding its period mystery \"The Illusionist\" into national release and jumped into fifth place with an estimated four-day gross of $8M. Expanding from 144 to 971 theaters, the Edward Norton–Paul Giamatti drama scored the best average in the top ten with a sturdy $8,261 per venue. Cume now stands at $12.1M. The distributor scored excellent averages during its two weeks in limited release allowing positive word-of-mouth to spread for a film that was not easy to sell at a time when there were plenty of good choices for mature adults. Another 400 theaters will be added on Friday.A trio of comedies followed. Sony’s Will Ferrell hit \"Talladega Nights\" grossed an estimated $7.7M over four days and lifted its cume to a stellar $138.4M making it the top-grossing comedy of the summer. Paramount’s animated pic \"Barnyard\" took in an estimated $6.4M pushing its total to $63.6M. The teen flick \"Accepted\" placed eighth and collected an estimated $5.9M giving Universal $29.4M to date.Rounding out the top ten were the 9/11 drama \"World Trade Center\" with an estimated $5.8M over four days and the dance saga \"Step Up\" with $5.5M, according to estimates. Paramount’s Oliver Stone film has taken in a solid $63.7M thus far while Buena Vista’s surprise hit has taken in $58.4M.Opening quietly outside of the top ten was the street basketball drama \"Crossover\" with an estimated $4.5M over four days from a moderate release in 1,023 theaters. Sony averaged a decent $4,399 over the long weekend on the $6M film which played mostly to a young urban audience.Platforming to muscular numbers was the IFC Films doc \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\" which grossed an estimated $42,000 from solo houses in New York and Los Angeles for a potent $20,832 average. The unrated expose that examines the ratings board of the MPAA will continue to expand throughout September.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. The raunchy comedy \"Beerfest\" tumbled to an estimated $4.6M over four days giving Warner Bros. only $14.8M in 11 days. A $20M final seems likely. Universal’s OutKast pic \"Idlewild\" took in an estimated $2.9M in its sophomore session giving the music-driven film only $9.9M in 11 days. Look for a $14M conclusion. New Line’s buzzworthy action-horror pic \"Snakes on a Plane\" has scared up just over $31M to date and is set to end with a final domestic gross close to its $35M production budget.The top ten films grossed an estimated $89M over four days which was down 3% from last year when \"Transporter 2\" debuted at number one with $20.1M; but up 19% from 2004 when \"Hero\" remained in the top spot with $11.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Red, First, Turner, psychological, travel, toronto, language, crime, rotten, CBS, parents, Mirror, FX, casting, Spring","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Invincible-Scores-Another-Win-at-1"},{"id":"47509160163453","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Jackass Crashes into Theaters","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Jackass Crashes into Theatersby Gitesh Pandya | September 21, 2006 |  CommentsFour new films open wide, but they may not be enough to stop the North American box office from suffering its third consecutive down weekend.Leading the way is the Paramount sequel \"Jackass: Number Two\" which will enjoy the widest release by far. The rest of the films will take moviegoers back in time just as so many other recent releases have done. Focus Features unleashes Jet Li‘s martial arts epic \"Fearless,\" MGM takes off with the World War I adventure \"Flyboys,\" and Sony remakes the political thriller \"All the King’s Men.\"Four years ago, Paramount shocked the industry with the number one bow for its crude stunts flick \"Jackass: The Movie\" which managed to keep \"The Ring\" out of the top spot on the weekend right before Halloween. Its $22.8M debut and eventual $64.3M domestic take and DVD success helped to bring about a sequel, \"Jackass: Number Two\" which hopes to conquer the charts once again. The R-rated pic regroups the team from the hit MTV reality series including Johnny Knoxville and finds them taking part in another series of outlandish don’t-try-this-at-home antics. Males in their late teens and early twenties are the target audience here although slightly older guys who were devoted followers a half-decade ago might also be up for some nostalgia.The first \"Jackass\" bowed to a muscular $9,073 average from 2,509 playdates which at today’s ticket prices would be over $10,000. \"Number Two\" is not likely to match that amount though. A wider launch will dilute the average a bit and the franchise has aged and is no longer at the peak of its popularity. But since Knoxville has found more mainstream success recently with films like \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and \"The Ringer,\" the studio is hoping that some new fans will give \"Two\" a try. Competition for males will be fierce with last weekend’s top film \"Gridiron Gang\" still playing to sports-loving boys and men while Jet Li’s new film \"Fearless\" willsteal away dudes who dig martial arts fighting, bones cracking, and necks breaking. Male dollars will be stretched to the limit this weekend and an already sluggish marketplace will mean that there will only be so much overall traffic. Busting into over 3,000 theaters, \"Jackass: Number Two\" will rank number one and may open with around $23M.Mr. Knoxville and co. are back to cheat death and reason.Also gunning for young men with R-rated fare is Focus Features with the historical martial arts actioner \"Fearless\" starring Jet Li. Already a hit at cinemas in Asia, Australia, and parts of Europe, the period pic tells the true story of a legendary fighter who inspired his nation in China at the start of the twentieth century. With a bigger star in the lead, \"Fearless\" is sure to perform better than Tony Jaa‘s Thai actioner \"The Protector\" which bowed to just $5M two weeks earlier. Li has a consistently loyal fan following that is likely to turn out especially since the marketing campaign is pushing the claim that this is his final martial arts film ever. This tactic gives the pic a level of urgency, although it should not mean much to those outside of his fan base. Crossover potential to mainstream action fans is not very likely, though the actor’s pull with urban males should not be underestimated.Still, Li has posted some impressive numbers in his career. Each of his six films from this decade has launched with an opening weekend average of at least $5,500 with five having averaged more than $6,000. His last effort \"Unleashed\" bowed last summer to $10.9M and a solid $5,570 average while 2004’s Chinese blockbuster \"Hero\" conquered the North American charts for two straight weeks bowing to an impressive $18M and $8,865 average. Foreign language films pretty much never do that in the U.S. market. \"Fearless\" will not duplicate the success of \"Hero\" which used the \"Quentin Tarantino Presents\" tag to attract extra biz. Plus with \"Jackass\" taking away many young men this weekend, only the true followers will make it out. But reviews have been very positive (the best for any newrelease) and advance buzz from overseas has been encouraging too. Kicking its way into roughly 1,806 theaters, \"Fearless\" might debut to about $9M.Jet Li inviting us to his last Martial Arts flick.World War I bi-planes are the draw in \"Flyboys,\" a new historical action adventure being released by MGM. The PG-13 film stars James Franco as a courageous American pilot in France who devotes his life to fighting for the Allies. With a high pricetag and no proven stars that can sell in America, this is yet another risky period film packed into the slow month of September. The \"inspired by a true story\" description used by half of the films in the current top ten is once again in play here. With sex and bad language kept to a minimum, \"Flyboys\" hopes to appeal to a broad family audience so adults can bring their kids. However, the starpower and subject matter are both lacking making this a tough sell at the box office especially since the marketplace is already filled with mediocre product. Zooming into 2,033 theaters, \"Flyboys\" might climb to around $7M over the weekend.The real star of \"Flyboys\": the CGI.After taking a beating at the Toronto International Film Festival, Sony’s remake \"All the King’s Men\" enters the marketplace on Friday with more subdued expectations. The PG-13 reworking of the classic 1949 political thriller stars Sean Penn as a charismatic politician from the South who gains power and flirts with corruption in the process. The all-star cast also includes Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins, Mark Ruffalo, and James Gandolfini. Distributors often utilize the Toronto fest to generate buzz for their Oscar contenders right before their fall commercial openings, but in this case, it seemed to have backfired with so many reviewers panning the pic. \"Men\" should play exclusively to a mature adult audience as teens will yawn at the premise. The marketplace has been flooded with period dramas in recent weeks with \"The Black Dahlia,\" \"Hollywoodland,\" and \"The Illusionist\" all going after the same audience. Competition will be a major factor.Sony is not giving its usual saturation release to \"King’s Men,\" but instead campaigning in just 1,514 theaters this weekend hoping some positive buzz will spread. The lack of screens will keep the gross in check and the bad reviews should sting even more. Last weekend, \"Dahlia\" found out the hard way how far a serious film for adults can go when the critics give a thumbs down. The film’s starpower is about its only major asset right now, but will it be enough to make moviegoers risk their dollars? With negative press, an abundance of direct competition, and only a moderate amount of theaters, \"All the King’s Men\" could find itself with only $7M this weekend and a rocky road ahead.Sean Penn’s politician wins over his constituents, but not the critics.In limited release, The Weinstein Co. unleashes its horror flick \"Feast\" in 140 theaters with special midnight shows across the country on Friday and Saturday. The latest winner from the Project Greenlight series is directed by John Gulager and finds a group of people trapped inside a bar fighting off flesh-eating creatures. Filmmaker Michel Gondry (\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\") returns to the surreal with \"The Science of Sleep,\" a new fantasy drama starring Gael García Bernal (\"The Motorcycle Diaries\") as a man whose dreams collide with reality. Warner Independent is opening the film on Friday in eight major U.S. markets and will expand it across the country next weekend. Miramax platforms its futuristic sci-fi toon \"Renaissance\" in New York and Los Angeles. Set in Paris in the year2054, the R-rated tale is the latest film to bring the look of a graphic novel to the big screen.Last weekend’s top film \"Gridiron Gang\" is sure to lose its first place ranking. The Rock‘s films never have very good legs on the second weekend as evidenced by the sophomore declines of his recent films – 48% for 2003’s \"The Rundown,\" 46% for 2004’s \"Walking Tall,\" and a horrendous 73% for last fall’s \"Doom.\" While \"Gang\" was not a favorite with critics, it has been getting favorable responses from moviegoers so its drop this weekend may not be too bad. Competition for young males will be a factor with the dueling R pics \"Jackass\" and \"Fearless,\" but younger boys may still be up for an uplifting football tale. \"Gridiron Gang\" might see a decline of 45% to around $8M giving Sony a reasonable ten-day cume of $25M.Universal’s murder mystery \"The Black Dahlia\" was not too powerful in its opening last weekend and both critics and moviegoers are giving negative feedback. A 50% fall would leave the Brian De Palma flick with $5M for the frame and a weak $18M after ten days.LAST YEAR: One A-list Hollywood blonde replaced another at the top of the charts. Jodie Foster‘s kidnapping thriller \"Flightplan\" flew to number one opening with a strong $24.6M. The Buena Vista release went on to gross $89.7M making it the top-grossing film in the September-October corridor for 2005. In second place, Warner Bros. expanded its animated film \"Corpse Bride\" nationally taking in $19.1M. The Tim Burton–Johnny Depp collaboration found its way to $53.4M. Reese Witherspoon fell from first to third with her comedy \"Just Like Heaven\" which collected $9.6M. Opening in fourth place with moderate results was the skating drama \"Roll Bounce\" which bowed to $7.6M on its way to $17.4M from less than 1,700 theaters. Close behind in fifth was the hit thriller \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" with $7.5M in its third round.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Biopics, Awards, Hallmark, book, who, CW, on, renewals, Globe, Arts, Fox","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Jackass-Crashes-into-Theaters"},{"id":"47509160158330","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Open Season Shoots Up #1 Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Open Season Shoots Up #1 Openingby Gitesh Pandya | October 2, 2006 |  CommentsAshton Kutcher ambushed the top two spots at the North American box office this weekend playing an animated mule and a Coast Guard rookie in Open Season and The Guardian, respectively. Both films enjoyed strong openings pumping in a combined $40M and helped the marketplace beat last year’s levels for the first time in four weeks. The weekend’s other new wide release, the comedy School for Scoundrels, saw more modest results with a fourth place bow.Sony claimed its usual position atop the charts with the animated comedy Open Season which brought in an estimated $23M in ticket sales over the weekend. Hunting moviegoers in an ultrawide 3,833 theaters, the PG-rated film about funny forest animals fighting off hunters averaged a strong $6,001 per site. Open Season marked the first venture from the studio’s new in-house animation division which will compete in the years ahead with dominant players in CG toons like Pixar and DreamWorks. Martin Lawrence and Kutcher led the voice cast.Sony research showed that 77% of the crowd consisted of parents with children under the age of 12, while girls were a bigger force making up 56% of the audience. A high 89% marked the film \"excellent\" or \"very good\". With strong exit polls and the Columbus Day school holiday coming up next week, the $85M film hopes to last throughout the month of October. For the studio, it was Sony’s record eleventh number one opening of the year. Of the company’s twenty film releases in the first nine months of 2006, half have debuted north of $20M.Kutcher’s face and body showed up in the weekend’s number two film, the Coast Guard action drama The Guardian, which opened with an estimated $17.7M. Also starring Kevin Costner, the Buena Vista release averaged a solid $5,451 per theater from 3,241 sites. The starpower helped bring in moviegoers who in turn liked the film. The Guardian earned an impressive CinemaScore grade of A-. Studio research showed that 50% of the crowd was in the 26-49 age bracket while males outnumbered the ladies with 53% of the audience. For Costner, who has not been a major box office force in over a decade, it was actually his best opening since Waterworld‘s $21.2M debut in 1995. Kutcher has seen many films debut in the same ballpark like The Butterfly Effect with $17.1M, Just Married with $17.5M, and Guess Who with $20.7M.Falling an understandable 52% from its top spot debut, Jackass: Number Two finished the weekend in third place with an estimated $14M. With $51.5M in ten days, the $12M production should deliver $70-75M for Paramount plus healthy DVD revenue down the road. The first Jackass film grossed $42.1M in its first ten days on its way to a $64.3M cume in 2002.Earning passing grades in fourth place was the Billy Bob Thornton–Jon Heder comedy School for Scoundrels which opened to an estimated $9.1M. Playing in 3,004 theaters, the PG-13 film about a young loser who seeks advice from an older pro on how to get women averaged a mild $3,032 per site. Reviews were not too encouraging for the MGM release.Jet Li‘s Fearless dropped a steep 56% in its second weekend and placed fifth with an estimated $4.7M. The action star’s \"final\" martial arts epic has grossed $17.8M in ten days and looks headed for about $26M. Each of Li’s last five films also fell by more than half on its sophomore frame.Sony’s football drama Gridiron Gang fell 52% to an estimated $4.5M pushing its cume to $33.2M. Enjoying the smallest decline in the top ten for the fourth consecutive weekend was the sleeper hit The Illusionist with $2.8M, off only 15%, for a total of $31.5M for Yari Film Group. MGM’s fighter pilot adventure Flyboys tumbled 61% in its second weekend to an estimated $2.3M. With only $9.9M in ten days, a final take of around $14M seems likely.Yet another period drama The Black Dahlia followed with an estimated $2.1M, down 54%, giving Universal only $20.7M to date. Rounding out the top ten with the biggest cume on the list was indie sensation Little Miss Sunshine with an estimated $2M, off 28%, for a total of $53.2M for Fox Searchlight. The acclaimed comedy has now matched megablockbusters Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest, The Da Vinci Code, and Cars by spending seven consecutive weekends in the top ten.A pair of critically-acclaimed dramas about world leaders opened to fantastic results in limited release. Miramax launched its Helen Mirren starrer The Queen on Saturday and grossed an estimated $123,000 from just three New York theaters for a potent two-day average of $41,000. The story of Queen Elizabeth II after the death of Princess Diana was double-screened at a pair of the arthouse venues and opened a day later than usual since on Friday it screened as the opening night film of the New York Film Festival. Mirren won the Best Actress prize at the Venice International Film Festival and is considered a major contender for an Oscar nod.Also a likely Academy Award nominee, but for the Best Actor trophy, was Forest Whitaker whose new film The Last King of Scotland debuted powerfully with an estimated $143,000 over three days from only four venues in New York and Los Angeles. The Fox Searchlight release finds Whitaker playing Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in the early 1970s. Since its Wednesday launch, Scotland has grossed $172,000 in five days and will expand into the top ten markets on Friday before spreading nationally on October 20.Posting a respectable debut in moderate national release was the football drama Facing the Giants which collected an estimated $1.4M from 441 theaters for a mild $3,150 average. The PG-rated pic about a coach who finds inspiration from God was released by Destination Films and Samuel Goldwyn Films.Warner Independent Pictures expanded its Michel Gondry pic The Science of Sleep from 14 to 221 theaters nationwide and grossed an estimated $1.2M. Averaging a solid $5,475 per location, the R-rated drama lifted its sum to $1.7M. Lionsgate widened its doc The U.S. vs. John Lennon grossing an estimated $210,000 from 57 sites for a moderate $3,684 average. Cume stands at $361,000.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Sony’s big fall flop All the King’s Men crumbled 56% in its second weekend to an estimated $1.6M giving the political drama a puny $6.3M in ten days. Rejected by audiences, the Sean Penn flick should finish its run quickly with a horrendous $9M. The studio’s supernatural teen thriller The Covenant fell 59% to an estimated $1.3M and upped its total to $22.2M. A $25M final should result for the $20M production. Fox’s baseball toon Everyone’s Hero got crushed by the arrival of Open Season and sank 79% to an estimated $1M. With a modest $13.2M thus far, the animated film could end up with only $15M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82.2M which was up 15% from last year when Flightplan remained at number one with $14.8M; but down 17% from 2004 when Shark Tale opened in the top spot with a fierce $47.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"nbcuniversal","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Open-Season-Shoots-Up-1-Opening"},{"id":"47509160157305","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Departed\" Arrives with a Bang","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Departed\" Arrives with a Bangby Gitesh Pandya | October 5, 2006 |  CommentsMovie studios are offering something for every age group over the Columbus Day holiday weekend. Mature adults will go undercover with Martin Scorsese‘s cop thriller \"The Departed,\" twentysomethings looking for a scare get the horror prequel \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning,\" while teenagers have a chance to laugh with the new comedy \"Employee of the Month.\"Meanwhile, last weekend’s number one film – the animated comedy \"Open Season\" – will continue to play to young children during a frame when a large percentage of students will have no class on Monday. The top ten will try to crack the $100M mark for the first time in nearly two months thanks to the variety of good product.Ranking dead last among Hollywood’s big six studios in year-to-date market share, Warner Bros. has a lot of catching up to do in the fourth quarter if it wants to prevent snapping its five-year streak of billion-dollar-plus box office years. So this weekend, it hands the ball off to Scorsese who delivers what critics are calling one of his best films ever with \"The Departed.\" The R-rated picture stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen. Overflowing with starpower, the Boston-set film is an American remake of the award-winning Hong Kong blockbuster \"Infernal Affairs\" which finds an Irish cop going undercover into the underworld and a mob mole infiltrating the police department.After rejecting a seemingly endless line of period dramas including \"Hollywoodland,\" \"The Black Dahlia,\" \"Flyboys,\" and \"All the King’s Men,\" adult audiences should be ready to throw its support behind a modern-day action thriller juiced up with major stars worth paying top dollar for. If the cast isn’t enough to seal the deal, glowing reviews from critics across the board should have a big impact on driving in traffic. In fact, reviews are among the best of any wide release hitting theaters this year. DiCaprio and Damon appeal to a wide age group so expect strong numbers from young adults. And Jack is that rare star who can flirt with age 70 but still be relevant to the iPod generation. With $100M blockbusters in each of the last four decades, the Oscar-winner is a perennial favorite and his films areevents.Warner Bros. has backed \"The Departed\" with a solid marketing campaign which is effectively exciting ticket buyers. No R-rated film has hit the $30M mark on opening weekend in nearly a year so that could once again be the ceiling on this film’s short-term potential. Appeal to both men and women is substantial, although as is typical at this time of year, business from males may be affected by football and the baseball playoffs. But word-of-mouth is likely to be very positive so look for the pic to remain a contender for weeks to come. With a colossal amount of starpower, sensational reviews, and a Monday holiday helping Sunday night sales,the Leo vs. Matt flick should be able to generate plenty of excitement with audiences this weekend. \"The Departed\" opens in 3,017 theaters on Friday and could gross about $27M over the frame.Leo DiCaprio, ‘lending a hand’ in Martin Scorsese’s \"The Departed.\"Moviegoers that don’t get starstruck, but instead want some gore and violence in their weekend entertainment, can opt for \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning.\" The prequel to the 2003 remake of the 1974 horror classic is an R-rated tale with Jordana Brewster (\"The Fast and the Furious\", \"Annapolis\") as its only star. Horror remakes usually do not rely on stars anyway, but on the brand name of a popular terrorfest. Budgets are relatively low with most of the money going towards production values rather than talent. Three years ago, the previous \"Massacre\" posted powerful numbers bowing to $28.1M in mid-October on its way to a brutal $80.1M. It opened the door to many other moneymaking remake hits like \"Dawn of the Dead,\" \"The Amityville Horror,\" and \"The Omen\" which each went on to gross over $50M.\"Beginning\" will play to hardcore genre fans that are older teens and young adults. But look for some older horror aficionados to take a curious peek too. The marketplace is primed and ready for its arrival as there has not been a major horror hit since June’s \"Omen\" pic hit cinemas. Add in the fact that Halloween is around the corner prompting audience demand for the genre to rise and a large turnout should be expected. Excitement does not seem to be reaching the same height that this installment’s predecessor had, so an opening in the high 20s may not result. Plus Leo, Matt, and even bad boy Jack will be drawing away many twentysomethings this weekend. Buzzing through victims in over 2,800 theaters, \"The Texas Chainsaw Massace: The Beginning\" could scare up around $19M this weekend.More teens in trouble in the latest \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" film.The classic love triangle storyline is set in a Walmart-like super store in the new Lionsgate comedy \"Employee of the Month.\" The PG-13 pic stars Dane Cook and Dax Shepard as co-workers competing for the attention of the hot new sales clerk, played by Jessica Simpson, who only dates those who win the coveted employee prize. The comedy should play to a teen and young adult audience and with the weekend’s other new films being R flicks, Month could score some points with the under-17 crowd. Teenage girls have especially been neglected this fall. Why would they care about 1940s murder mysteries, moronic stunt films, or Sean Penn as a flamboyant politician? Two hunky young dudes fighting over the former Daisy Duke could make for the most interesting film to grab their attention since \"Step Up.\"Still, \"Employee of the Month\" will have its work cut out for it. Many older teens and young adults will be drawn away by \"Departed\" and \"Chainsaw\" and Ashton Kutcher fans are still checking out \"The Guardian.\" Starpower is not too high, but teenagers in need of a laugh will not have many other options. Opening in 2,579 theaters, \"Employee of the Month\" could debut with around $10M.Dane Cook, in his first leading role in \"Employee of the Month.\"Sony’s animated comedy \"Open Season\" enjoyed a healthy start to its run last weekend and will face no new competition during the sophomore frame. Plus with the Columbus Day school holiday, the Martin Lawrence – Ashton Kutcher toon should remain a popular (and only) option for young children. A 30% drop would give \"Season\" about $16M over the weekend and a sturdy ten-day cume of $46M.Buena Vista’s Coast Guard adventure \"The Guardian\" did moderately well in its debut last weekend, but adult audiences will be pulled away by the starpower of \"The Departed\" this weekend. The studio has been reporting strong exit polls so word-of-mouth could prevent a large falloff. A 40% decline would give \"Guardian\" about $11M for the weekend and $34M in ten days.\"Jackass: Number Two\" will face some stiff competition from the weekend’s two new R-rated films so a 45% drop could be in order. That would leave the Paramount hit with $8M and an impressive 17-day total of $64M allowing the comedy sequel to surpass the gross of the 2002 original in under three weeks.LAST YEAR: New films invaded the box office over the Columbus Day frame taking four of the top five slots. Leading the way was the acclaimed claymation pic \"Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\" with a $16M debut. The DreamWorks film enjoyed good legs and ended up with $56.1M domestically plus the Oscar for Best Animated Film. Jodie Foster‘s two-time chart-topper \"Flightplan\" held up well in its third weekend grossing $10.8M for Buena Vista. Cameron Diaz opened her new comedy \"In Her Shoes\" in third place with $10M on its way to $32.9M for Fox. Universal followed with the sports betting film \"Two For the Money\" with a $8.7M bow and Sony opened its drama \"The Gospel\" in fifth with $7.5M. Final grosses reached $22.9M and $15.8M, respectively. Lions Gate saw its new comedy \"Waiting\" launch in seventh place with just $6M leading to a $16.1M final. Opening with strong results in limited release were the acclaimed dramas \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" and \"The Squid and the Whale\" which both earned rave reviews and kudos during awards season. Their domestic grosses reached $31.6M and $7.4M, respectively.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"children's, comic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Departed-Arrives-with-a-Bang"},{"id":"47509160161404","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Jackass\" #1, \"Little Miss Sunshine\" Crosses $50M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Jackass\" #1, \"Little Miss Sunshine\" Crosses $50Mby Gitesh Pandya | September 25, 2006 |  CommentsYoung men returned to theaters in droves and powered the crude new stunts sequel Jackass: Number Two to the number one spot with the biggest opening weekend of any film in the past seven weeks. The martial arts actioner Fearless debuted impressively in second place playing to young men as well, but the new older-skewing period dramas Flyboys and All the King’s Men were mostly ignored.Holdovers enjoyed small declines as the overall marketplace bounced back after two dismal weeks, even though ticket sales failed to reach last year’s levels for the third consecutive weekend.Paramount scored a major victory with the chart-topping performance of Jackass: Number Two which grossed an estimated $28.1M in its first weekend in theaters. Crashing into 3,059 locations, the R-rated comedy averaged a stellar $9,188 per theater. Its predecessor, Jackass: The Movie, was a surprise number one hit in October 2002 with a $22.8M bow from 2,509 theaters and a similar $9,073 average. It went on to gross a fantastic $64.3M from a slim $5M budget. Number Two was produced for just under $12M and looks to become another highly profitable title for the studio proving that the franchise is still alive and well. The films are based on the popular MTV prank series.With six historical films in the top ten, young movie fans were not in the mood to learn about yesterday and instead chose the immature and outrageous antics of present day jokester Johnny Knoxville and pals. Studio research showed that young men were the core audience, as expected. Those under the age of 25 made up a hefty 70% of the crowd and males accounted for 65%. Jackass also delivered the second biggest opening of the year for an R film trailing the $29M bow of March’s Inside Man. Critics were surprisingly upbeat with their reviews of Number Two.Jet Li‘s Fearless flew into the number two spot over the weekend opening to an estimated $10.6M from 1,808 theaters with a solid $5,843 average. The PG-13 film about China’s most famous fighter from a century ago was marketed as the action star’s final martial arts picture ever and helped to get his loyal fan base out into the theaters. The Focus release marks Li’s seventh consecutive film to debut with an opening weekend average of more than $5,000. Critics were quite pleased with the Mandarin-language picture. Fearless opened in Hong Kong and most of Asia early this year and has kicked its way into other major markets like Australia, New Zealand, and France in recent weeks.Dropping from first to third was The Rock‘s football drama Gridiron Gang which grossed an estimated $9.7M in its second play. The Sony sports flick held up exceptionally well considering the weekend’s formidable competition for male dollars and slipped only 33%. The Rock’s movies usually fall by at least 45% in their sophomore frames. After ten days, the $30M feel-good film has grossed $27.2M and should rush past the $50M mark domestically. Even though Gridiron began with the weakest opening ever for the actor, it looks to become his highest grossing film since 2002’s The Scorpion King ($90.5M) thanks to strong legs and positive word-of-mouth.MGM’s Flyboys took off in fourth place with an estimated $6M from 2,033 theaters. The PG-13 pic about American fighter pilots during World War I averaged a mild $2,957 per theater. Starring James Franco, the adventure film skewed older as a very high 73% of the audience was over the age of 30. Men made up 59% of the crowd and reviews were not too favorable. Flyboys is the third consecutive period drama in as many weeks that has failed to excite today’s moviegoing public following disappointing results from competing Los Angeles-based murder mysteries The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland.A pair of not-so-strong sophomores followed. The animated baseball flick Everyone’s Hero grossed an estimated $4.8M, down just 22%, and raised its ten-day tally to $11.6M. Fox could finish with around $25M. Universal’s crime thriller The Black Dahlia crumbled 56% to an estimated $4.4M dropping from second place to sixth. The $60M Brian De Palma entry has taken in just $17.3M and might end up with a disappointing $25M as well.Sony saw low voter turnout for its political thriller All the King’s Men which was defeated in a landslide this weekend opening to a poor $3.8M, according to estimates. Averaging a weak $2,510 from 1,514 locations, the PG-13 film stars Sean Penn as an outspoken politician who runs for governor of Louisiana. Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins and James Gandolfini co-star. The studio had high hopes for this remake of a Best Picture Oscar winner, but instead met with awful reviews across the board from critics which helped to fuel negative buzz. Only older adults had interest as studio research showed that a whopping 75% of the audience was 35 or older and 53% were women. All the King’s Men is just the latest in a series of historical films that Hollywood has been rolling out this fall that have had moviegoers yawning.The supernatural chiller The Covenant dropped only 31% to an estimated $3.3M with a sum of $20.3M for Sony. For the fourth consecutive weekend, the long-lasting hits The Illusionist and Little Miss Sunshine ranked back-to-back on the charts. Yari Film Group’s Vienna-set mystery eased a scant 10% to an estimated $3.3M pushing its total to $27.5M. Fox Searchlight’s comedy smash slipped just 13% to an estimated $2.9M lifting the cume to $50.3M.In limited release action, Warner Independent saw stellar results from its surreal drama The Science of Sleep which bowed to an estimated $347,000 from only 14 theaters for a sparkling $24,786 average. Directed by Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), the R-rated film scored good reviews and will expand to over 200 theaters on Friday in most major markets. Miramax saw a so-so start for its animated noir Renaissance which debuted to an estimated $10,000 from a pair of solo engagements in New York and Los Angeles for a mild $5,200 average.Four more pictures were pushed out of the top ten this weekend. Two-time chart-topper Invincible grossed an estimated $2.6M in its fifth session. Off 36%, the Mark Wahlberg football pic has collected a solid $54.8M to date and might end up with around $60M for Buena Vista. The Zach Braff comedy The Last Kiss grossed an estimated $2.5M, down 45%, putting its ten-day total at a puny $8.5M. A final take of roughly $15M seems likely.The murder mystery Hollywoodland fell 46% in its third frame to an estimated $1.5M for Focus. With only $12.9M in the bank, look for a weak $16M conclusion to its case. Lionsgate’s action thriller Crank tumbled 56% to an estimated $1.2M for a $26.6M cume. The Jason Statham pic should reach about $29M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $76.8M which was down 9% from last year when Flightplan debuted at number one with $24.6M; but up a healthy 38% from 2004 when The Forgotten opened in the top spot with $21M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"President, casting, drama, Review","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Jackass-1-Little-Miss-Sunshine-Crosses-50M"},{"id":"47509160167551","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Rock’s \"Gang\" Aims to Score Big","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Rock's \"Gang\" Aims to Score Bigby Gitesh Pandya | September 14, 2006 |  CommentsFollowing the worst box office weekend in three years, Hollywood has nowhere to go but up. It hopes.Four new pictures enter wide release on Friday led by the sports drama \"Gridiron Gang\" from Sony which is gunning for its tenth trip to the number one spot this year. Universal goes after an older crowd with the crime thriller \"The Black Dahlia,\" Fox aims for kids with the animated film \"Everyone’s Hero,\" and Paramount tries to court the adult date crowd with \"The Last Kiss.\" Overall, the North American marketplace should bounce back from last weekend’s horrible showing, but only by a small margin.Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson hopes to score the fifth number one opening of his career this weekend with the football saga \"Gridiron Gang.\" The PG-13 film finds the wrestler-turned-actor playing a juvenile camp officer who assembles a pigskin squad in order to give lost kids some hope in life. Sony is targeting one of the most reliable moviegoing segments with \"Gang\" – urban youth. With a young and multicultural cast, plus a star in the lead role, this new film hopes to appeal to the same crowd that made hits out of other sports flicks like \"Remember the Titans\" and \"Coach Carter.\" Of course, the star this time is not an Oscar-caliber actor. \"Gang’s\" marketing push has been strong and an ultrawide release will make the product available everywhere.Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson in \"Gridiron Gang.\"The Rock provides solid starpower, although his box office muscle in recent years has delivered openings in a very narrow range. Pics like \"The Rundown,\" \"Walking Tall,\" and \"Doom\" have all debuted within the $15-19M range. \"Gridiron Gang’s\" rating should open the doors to a wider audience and with the start of the NFL and college football seasons, the subject matter is very relevant at this time of year. Plus with a dead marketplace featuring choices that are exciting nobody, teens and young adults should find this one the only film worth rallying behind. Charging into 3,504 locations, \"Gridiron Gang\" will have no problem conquering the box office and could score around $17M this weekend.Moviegoers opting for a trip back to the 1940s instead of a football pic can choose Brian De Palma‘s \"The Black Dahlia\" which Universal opens on Friday. The R-rated thriller stars Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart as Los Angeles cops investigating the mysterious death of a young woman chopped in half and disemboweled. Scarlett Johansson and two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank take the token female roles. Just as with \"Hollywoodland\" which bowed last weekend, \"Dahlia\" will play to an older adult audience interested in LA-based crime noir pics from the mid twentieth century. Unlike with the younger-skewing \"Gridiron Gang,\" reviews will play a big part in the success or failure of \"Dahlia.\" This one needs more support from critics than it’s getting in order to become a commercial winner. Starpower is certainly there, but the subject matter may not pique the interest of adults across all 50 states. Add in competition for the target audience plus an overall slowdown in moviegoing activity and it may be hard for the studio to break even on this one. \"The Black Dahlia\" enters 2,224 theaters and might collect around $9M this weekend.Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart are on the case in \"The Black Dahlia.\"Following this summer’s \"Superman Returns\" and last week’s George Reeves mystery \"Hollywoodland,\" the Man of Steel spotlight now turns to the late Christopher Reeve whose final project, the animated sports tale \"Everyone’s Hero,\" makes its way into theaters on Friday. With voices provided by Rob Reiner, Whoopi Goldberg, and William H. Macy, the G-rated flick tells of a boy on a mission to retrieve Babe Ruth’s stolen bat. Reeve co-directed with Colin Brady and Dan St. Pierre. Fox will be looking to attract kids and Little League coach parents with \"Hero.\" The film is not registering too high on the priority lists of children. But the studio does have one thing working in its favor – the current marketplace has nothing major for children. And don’t expect the other new releases to appeal to the family crowd either. Opening surprisingly wide in 2,896 theaters, \"Everyone’s Hero\" could score around $7M this weekend.The animated Babe Ruth in Christopher Reeve’s \"Everyone’s Hero.\"TV stars Zach Braff of NBC’s \"Scrubs\" and Rachel Bilson of Fox’s \"The O.C.\" join forces on the big screen in \"The Last Kiss\" which Paramount inherited from its DreamWorks tie-up. The R-rated remake of an Italian film about a man in the early stages of a mid-life crisis also stars Casey Affleck, Blythe Danner, and Tom Wilkinson. The marketing push behind \"Kiss\" has been lacking so look for the romantic dramedy to become a small blip on the box office radar this weekend. Adult women will make up the primary audience making period pics \"Dahlia\" and \"Hollywoodland\" direct competitors. Consumer excitement is pretty low for \"The Last Kiss\" which heads into only 1,100 theaters. A weekend gross of roughly $4M could result.Zach Braff and that chick from \"The Real World\" in \"The Last Kiss.\"The new fall season brings a flood of activity in limited-release action. Balcony Releasing got the frame started on Wednesday with its New York opening of the political doc \"Al Franken: God Spoke\" which adds a second Manhattan venue on Friday. The raunchy softball comedy \"Artie Lange’s Beer League\" opens on Friday in about 175 theaters. With Ralph Macchio in the cast, the R-rated Echo Bridge release should find itself stuck in six-digit territory. Yari Film Group unleashes the Cayman Islands-set drama \"Haven,\" which stars Orlando Bloom and Bill Paxton, into 24 theaters across the country.The mockumentary wedding comedy \"Confetti\" bows in a dozen sites from Fox Searchlight. American troops in Iraq are the focus of the Focus Features documentary \"The Ground Truth\" which attacks eight theaters. Lionsgate offers up its own non-fiction flick \"The U.S. vs. John Lennon\" in six playdates examining the Beatles icon’s rage against the establishment.Sony’s ninth number one of the year \"The Covenant\" looks to get booted out of the top spot by the studio’s tenth chart-topper. A 50% drop would give the teen thriller about $4.5M for the frame and a modest ten-day cume of $15M. \"Hollywoodland\" lacked strength in its debut and will now face a direct hit from \"Dahlia\" so a 45% decline could be in order. That would give Focus around $3.5M over the weekend putting the total at a weak $11M after ten days.LAST YEAR: Reese Witherspoon captured the number one spot with her latest comedy \"Just Like Heaven\" which grossed $16.4M on its way to $48.3M for DreamWorks. Sony’s surprise suspense hit \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" lost half its business and dropped to second with $14.9M in its sophomore frame. Nicolas Cage bowed in third with his new actioner \"Lord of War\" with $9.4M. The Lions Gate release reached $24.1M. Steve Carell enjoyed his fifth week in the top five with \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" which laughed up $6M. The horror pic \"Cry Wolf\" bowed poorly in fifth with only $4.4M leading to a $10M finish.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Super, Emmy, scorecard, Purge, 78th, The, Network, diversity, Worst, cancelled, werewolf, RT21, of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Rocks-Gang-Aims-to-Score-Big"},{"id":"47509160160379","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Ashton vs. Ashton – This Time It’s Personal","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Ashton vs. Ashton - This Time It's Personalby Gitesh Pandya | September 28, 2006 |  CommentsAshton Kutcher fans get two chances to see (or hear) their favorite star this weekend as the Hollywood prankster takes on reigning box office champ \"Jackass: Number Two\" by voicing a mule deer in the animated comedy \"Open Season\" and going up against Kevin Costner in the action drama \"The Guardian.\"Also opening nationally is the Billy Bob Thornton–Jon Heder comedy \"School For Scoundrels\" while some potential Oscar contenders debut in the arthouses.Hollywood’s umpteenth computer-animated feature film of the year hits multiplexes on Friday in the form of \"Open Season.\" The PG-rated pic features the voices of Martin Lawrence and Kutcher and finds a domesticated grizzly bear being dropped into the wilderness right before the start of hunting season. Young kids usually eat up these fish-out-of-water comedy toons and this Sony release should play to the same family audience. The target demographic has had an endless line of movies this year featuring talking animals getting into wacky situations, but since the current marketplace is lacking any major offering for children, \"Open Season\" should score as the first animated hit of the new school year. The studio is saturating the market with screens giving the film the fourth widest bow ever for a non-DreamWorks toon, and the second widest in Sony history for any film after 2004’s webslinger sequel. With no competition and solid funnyman starpower behind the mics, a strong number one bow could result. \"Open Season\" makes its way into 3,833 theaters and may debut with around $24M this weekend.Ashton Kutcher, in his other film, \"Open Season.\"For those who would rather see the \"Punk’d\" star’s face, Buena Vista sets sail with its Coast Guard thriller \"The Guardian\" which finds Kutcher playing a young and cocky swimming champ who butts heads with his unorthodox teacher played by Kevin Costner. Directed by Andrew Davis (\"The Fugitive,\" \"Collateral Damage\"), the PG-13 film has broad appeal with each star pulling in his respective generation. Cross-gender appeal is also present with the military-like storyline doing the job for males and the hunky actors attracting the ladies. Disney offered successful sneak previews two weeks ago to get some word-of-mouth spreading before the official debut. The studio will try to lure in the same audience that spent a solid $22.1M on the John Travolta–Joaquin Phoenix firefighter drama \"Ladder 49\" two autumns ago. Launching in over 3,000 theaters, \"The Guardian\" might debut with about $18M.Kevin Costner to the rescue in \"The Guardian.\"Following his commercial success with the male-driven comedy hits \"Road Trip,\" \"Old School,\" and \"Starsky &amp; Hutch,\" Todd Phillips returns to theaters with \"School for Scoundrels\" which finds Billy Bob Thornton squaring off against \"Napoleon Dynamite\"’s Jon Heder for the affection of a young gal. MGM’s PG-13 film about an awkward young misfit who enlists the help of an expert on getting the ladies should aim for an audience of teens and young adults, plus fans of the \"Bad Santa\" star’s rogue ways. Starpower is not very high here. Films anchored by the former Mr. Jolie usually don’t explode on opening weekend as evidenced by the recent debuts of \"The Bad News Bears\" ($11.4M), \"The Ice Harvest\" ($3.7M), and \"The Alamo\" ($9.1M). Competition for young males will be tough, but if \"School\" can connect with teen girls as a funny romantic comedy, then it has a chance of doing some respectable numbers. Opening in over 3,000 theaters, \"School for Scoundrels\" might debut with about $12M.Thornton, Heder, and that Real World chick again in \"School For Scoundrels.\"Some high profile indies pop into limited release this weekend. Fox Searchlight launched its Idi Amin pic \"The Last King of Scotland\" in four theaters on Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles and has already been receiving early Oscar buzz for Forest Whitaker‘s portrayal of the Ugandan dictator. Coincidentally, a year ago this same weekend, \"Capote\" debuted and fueled its own Best Actor buzz which sustained itself throughout awards season leading to a trophy for Philip Seymour Hoffman. Reviews for \"Scotland\" have been good and for Whitaker, have been electric.Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin in \"The Last King of Scotland.\"Miramax gets its Oscar campaign going, but for the Best Actress prize, with its Helen Mirren film \"The Queen\" which opens in New York City on Saturday after it officially opens the New York Film Festival on Friday evening. Mirren has already taken home the top actress prize at the Venice Film Festival for her role as Queen Elizabeth II in the dark days after the death of Princess Diana. The PG-13 film is directed by Stephen Frears (\"Mrs. Henderson Presents,\" \"Dangerous Liaisons\") and has ranked number two at the U.K. box office for the last two weeks.First Look Studios takes audiences back to Queens in 1986 with its coming-of-age drama \"A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\" which stars Robert Downey Jr., Chazz Palminteri, Shia LaBeouf, Dianne Wiest, Channing Tatum, and Rosario Dawson. The R-rated film won awards for Best Director and Best Ensemble at this year’s Sundance Film Festival and bows in New York and Los Angeles on Friday.Last weekend, \"Jackass: Number Two\" flexed its muscles at the box office with a better-than-expected $29M launch. The Paramount film’s predecessor dropped 44% in its second weekend in the fall of 2002, but the sequel may drop harder. A 50% decline would still give the Johnny Knoxville flick about $15M for the weekend and a strong ten-day cume of $51M.Jet Li‘s \"Fearless\" also drew upon a built-in audience of young men last weekend setting itself up for a sizable sophomore drop. The Focus title might also lose half of its business and take in roughly $5M. That would give the martial arts saga $18M after ten days. Sony’s \"Gridiron Gang\" held up well last weekend despite tough competition. Another 35% fall could be in order giving The Rock a $6M frame and a $34M total after 17 days.LAST YEAR: For the second straight weekend, Jodie Foster‘s airline thriller \"Flightplan\" topped the box office with $14.8M dropping only 40% from its bow. Opening in second place was the sci-fi actioner \"Serenity\" which grossed $10.1M on its way to $25.4M for Universal. Warner Bros. followed close behind with $10M for its animated comedy \"Corpse Bride.\" The revenge thriller \"A History of Violence\" expanded nationally and placed fourth with $8.1M and a solid $6,047 average which was the best in the whole Top 20. Opening in fifth was the Jessica-Alba-in-a-bikini pic \"Into the Blue\" with only $7.1M leading to a weak $18.5M final for Sony. Disney debuted its historical golf drama \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\" to the tune of $3.7M. A $15.3M final gross resulted.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"game-of-thrones, The, Comics, Lucasfilm, 2017","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Ashton-vs-Ashton-This-Time-Its-Personal"},{"id":"47509163298962","title":"Box Office Preview: Pirates To Loot Box Office Treasure","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: Pirates To Loot Box Office Treasureby Gitesh Pandya | July 6, 2006 |  CommentsMultiplexes are stocking up on popcorn and soda in anticipation of the massive crowds expected to descend upon them on Friday for the opening of the highly anticipated adventure sequel \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest.\" Rival studios all backed off this weekend when Disney first claimed it as nobody wanted to challenge Captain Jack Sparrow and his mighty treasure-seeking companions. After its top spot debut, reigning champ \"Superman Returns\" will have a big task ahead of it as the super hero film tries to keep audiences from fleeing in its all-important second weekend. With \"Pirates\" and \"Superman\" leading the way, the North American box office looks to zoom higher than last year and even seems strong enough to soar past 2004’s lofty heights.For the first time in company history, Disney will break the 4,000 theater mark with the launch of its new \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" sequel. The PG-13 film reunites the cast and crew of the 2003 megablockbuster with Gore Verbinski once again in the director’s chair and Johnny Depp, who earned an Oscar nomination the first time around, returning to play the central character. Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and superproducer Jerry Bruckheimer are also back giving audiences another swashbuckling adventure on the high seas. In the latest saga, Sparrow owes a blood debt to the great pirate Davy Jones and must find a mysterious treasure chest, or else be doomed to eternal damnation.Three years ago, the studio hit theaters with a big-budget action film based on a Disneyland ride which seemed to be one of the riskiest pics of the summer. \"Pirates\" bowed on a Wednesday and was an instant hit with audiences grossing $46.6M over its first weekend and $70.6M over its five-day launch. But beyond that, \"Pirates\" had legs and spent eleven weeks in the top ten before ending its run with $305.4M making it the second biggest blockbuster of the summer. Depp provided a breath of fresh air during an endless summer of action sequels with recycled characters and plots. Worldwide, \"Pirates\" sailed away with $654M worth of loot giving the studio a craving for more gold. Two sequels were greenlit with the concluding chapter set to open over Memorial Day weekend 2007.Disney has staked out the same weekend after Independence Day for \"Dead Man’s Chest.\" This time around, with a bigger upfront audience and a Friday bow which will compress business into a standard Friday-to-Sunday period, the pirate adventure has a chance of scoring one of the largest opening weekends in box office history. Five films have generated three-day bows north of $100M. The first, 2002’s \"Spider-Man,\" still holds the record with $114.8M from 3,615 theaters. Since then, some of Hollywood’s biggest sequels have come within striking distance of the webslinger, but none has truly been able to match it. \"Shrek 2\" opened to $108M after a Wednesday bow, \"Star Wars Episode III\" debuted to $108.4M after a Thursday start, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" launched to $102.3M, and \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" opened to $102.8M over the three-day portion of its Memorial Day weekend holiday opening.The second \"Pirates\" saga has an excellent chance of reaching nine digits in its first three days and even Spidey himself has to be a little nervous about losing his trophy. Disney’s marketing efforts have been very strong, but not over the top. As Paramount found out with its third Ethan Hunt film, moviegoers can get turned off by an overmarketed movie. \"Pirates\" actors have been doing the talk show and magazine cover rounds, but the studio has made sure that the hype doesn’t get so big that it backfires.Appeal for the new Captain Jack film is broad as moviegoers of all ages will be lining up. And more importantly, \"Pirates\" has some of the strongest appeal to women of any of the action franchises around. Men are an easy sell for the genre, but with Johnny and Orlando front and center, the female turnout will be key in getting those grosses up to levels rarely seen. The first film saw its audience grow significantly during its theatrical run and later on video so this time around, there could be twice as many people showing up on opening weekend.Cutting into \"Dead Man\"’s potential, however, could be the long running time — a common problem with so many of this summer’s films. At two-and-a-half hours long, the film will test the patience of some and have one less showing per auditorium when compared to the standard two-hour films. Of course, the last \"Harry Potter\" and \"Star Wars\" films had similar lengths and still soared past the $100M mark on opening weekend. And even though they should suffer large drops, \"Superman Returns\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada\" will be in their sophomore frames and still absorb a solid amount of business.But with no other films opening, the entertainment media has been focusing solely on \"Pirates\" this week so at least there won’t be fellow freshman to deal with. Reviews have been mixed, and as with most sequels, they have not been as glowing as they were the first time around. That should mean little on the debut frame though. Excitement is sky high and Disney has a solid product on its hands. With clear sailing ahead of it, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest\" might capture around $104M worth of box office loot this weekend.Since no other studio dared to challenge Disney this weekend with any wide releases, Warner Independent Pictures picked Friday for its limited bow of the futuristic crime drama \"A Scanner Darkly.\" Directed by Richard Linklater (\"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Waking Life\"), the R-rated film stars Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Winona Ryder, and Woody Harrelson in a story about an undercover cop hooked on a popular narcotic who is out to bring down drug dealers. \"Scanner\" is based on the popular novel and features live-action material animated into a stylized new look. The film debuts in 17 theaters this weekend before expanding to more markets later this month.And what of the son of Krypton? Analysts will be watching the second weekend numbers closely for \"Superman Returns\" to find its true trajectory over the long run. Will it hold up like \"Batman Begins,\" crash and burn like \"The Hulk,\" or fall somewhere in between? Its opening weekend delivered sales that were lower than expectations, but Warner Bros. insists that those paying to see the pic are liking it. Sophomore drops for recent Independence Day weekend launches include 53% for \"War of the Worlds\" last year and 49% for 2004’s \"Spider-Man 2.\" The Man of Steel is coming off of a similar type of midweek debut, however it faces the mammoth \"Pirates\" sequel which will play to much of the same summer action audience. With a little luck, \"Superman Returns\" might keep its drop-off rate to 50% which would give the Bryan Singer-directed pic about $26M for the frame. That should boost the 12-day cume to $146M.Meryl Streep was rolling in cash last weekend with the opening of her new comedy \"The Devil Wears Prada\" which was a potent number two in the holiday race. A sizable decline is in order since Hurricane Johnny will hit but also because the film’s audience of readers of the popular book probably made it out already. A fall of 45% would give \"Prada\" around $15M for the session and a stellar ten-day tally of $62M.The usual erosion should hit \"Click\" which has been playing out like the usual Adam Sandler comedy. Look for another 50% fall to roughly $10M for a cume to date of $101M. The animated hit \"Cars\" has enjoyed some of the best legs of any summer film so far, but older kids will certainly start walking the plank for Disney’s other big summer blockbuster this weekend. Pixar’s latest flick could drop by 40% to around $9M which would boost the total to $202M making it the third film of the year to break the $200M mark. The May releases \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" and \"The Da Vinci Code\" were the first.LAST YEAR: Super hero power ruled the weekend as Fox’s \"Fantastic Four\" opened atop the charts with a potent $56.1M launching another successful Marvel film franchise. Reed Richards and pals went on to gross $154.7M domestically and $330M worldwide and will hit theaters again next summer in the sequel. Tom Cruise‘s alien invasion pic \"War of the Worlds\" dropped to second place with $30.5M in its sophomore session losing 53% of its business. Another comic book flick, \"Batman Begins,\" placed third in its fourth outing with $10M. Debuting close behind in fourth was the Jennifer Connelly horror entry \"Dark Water\" with $9.9M on its way to $25.5M for Buena Vista. \"Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith\" rounded out the top five with $7.9M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"First, FirstLook, christmas, drama, e., south, Pride, Nickelodeon, Trivia, know","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Pirates-To-Loot-Box-Office-Treasure"},{"id":"47509161708685","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Pirates\" Passes $300M; \"Lady\" Stumbles","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Pirates\" Passes $300M; \"Lady\" Stumblesby Gitesh Pandya | July 24, 2006 |  CommentsJohnny Depp made this weekend’s four new releases walk the plank as his megablockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest became the first film of the year to spend three consecutive frames at number one and zoomed past the $300M mark in record time.Among the new offerings debuting in theaters, Sony’s animated film Monster House posted the best results opening in second place while M. Night Shyamalan‘s latest supernatural thriller Lady in the Water stumbled in its first weekend settling for third place. The comedies Clerks II from Kevin Smith and My Super Ex-Girlfriend from Ivan Reitman debuted with more modest single-digit results outside the top five. Overall ticket sales were a healthy amount ahead of last year’s.Sailing past more box office records with ease, Pirates grossed an estimated $35M in its third weekend to remain the top choice among summer moviegoers across North America. Off a moderate 44%, the Disney smash became the fastest film to break the $300M mark when it surpassed the milestone on Saturday, its 16th day of release. Star Wars Episode III previously held the record doing the deed in 17 days last summer. Pirates now stands at $321.7M after a mere 17 days and has soared up to number 16 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters ahead of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone which grossed $317.6M in 2001.Dead Man’s Chest also entered a very exclusive club of films that reached the triple-century mark while still at number one. It joins only 1982’s E.T., 1997’s Titanic, and 2003’s The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The third weekend hold for Pirates was commendable showing that the high seas adventure is not falling apart like many action sequels and instead still pleasing audiences. It now looks to be on course to reach $400M in box office treasure.Sony generated a solid debut for the animated film Monster House which opened in second place with an estimated $23M from 3,553 locations. The PG-rated tale about three kids who discover an evil home averaged an impressive $6,473 per theater. Oscar-winning directors Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis served as executive producers and had their names used prominently in the marketing. As the first toon for kids in over a month, Monster scored with children and parents who made up the bulk of the audience. The studio released the $75M production in 163 3-D theaters which collected $2.6M of the overall gross for a sizzling $16,012 average. Reviews were mostly positive.Suffering his worst opening since becoming an A-list director, M. Night Shyamalan saw his latest thriller Lady in the Water struggle in its debut grossing an estimated $18.2M from 3,235 theaters. The PG-13 film about a mysterious creature from the water who must return to her world averaged $5,629 per site. The opening was less than half the size of the $50.7M bow of Shyamalan’s last film The Village and less than one-third of the $60.1M that his previous film Signs took in when it opened in 2002. Critics panned Lady which was promoted as being a \"bedtime story\" as the Oscar-nominated filmmaker earned the worst reviews of his career.Shyamalan’s last four thrillers were all released by Disney but after The Village, the studio passed on the opportunity to make Lady. The project found itself over at Warner Bros. Village opened impressively based on the brand name of Shyamalan, however negative word-of-mouth led to it crashing 68% on the second weekend and quickly disappearing soon after. In fact, its final domestic tally of $114.2M remains the lowest gross ever for any film opening north of $50M. Many former fans may have decided to pass on his follow-up which was Lady. It could be rough seas ahead for Water as well since its Saturday sales were flat compared to Friday’s. Plus, it has scored a weak B- average grade from over 3,000 users of Yahoo Movies which means ticket buyers have not been very thrilled.Universal’s hit comedy You, Me, and Dupree dropped a moderate 41% in its second weekend and placed fourth with an estimated $12.8M. With a solid $45.3M in ten days, the $54M picture should find its way to a sturdy $70-75M. Fellow sophomore comedy Little Man saw a larger drop and fell 49% to an estimated $11M for a total of $40.6M in ten days. Sony’s $64M Wayans brothers film looks to find its way to $60-65M.Fans showed support for Kevin Smith whose comedy sequel Clerks II debuted in sixth place with an estimated $9.6M from 2,150 theaters. Averaging a good $4,477 per site, the R-rated story of a pair of slackers still doing little with their lives in their thirties opened a bit weaker than Smith’s 2001 late-summer pic Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back which bowed to $11M on its way to $30.1M. Ticket sales for Clerks II fell a sharp 18% on Saturday from Friday indicating that Smith’s loyal fans rushed out on opening day and that there may not be much of an audience left for future weeks. The film earned favorable reviews and was released by MGM and The Weinstein Company.Fox saw a disappointing opening for its romantic comedy My Super Ex-Girlfriend which debuted to an estimated $8.7M from 2,702 theaters for a mild $3,220 average. The PG-13 film stars Uma Thurman as a woman who is secretly a super hero that exacts revenge on her ex-boyfriend (Luke Wilson) for dumping her. Reviews were mixed for the Ivan Reitman-directed pic. Studio research showed that the audience was split evenly between men and women with those age 25 and older making up 59% of the crowd. With so many other comedies in the marketplace from Owen Wilson, the Wayans brothers, Kevin Smith, Meryl Streep, and Adam Sandler, plus Pirates still raking it in, audiences found no special reason to spend money on Ex-Girlfriend.Superman Returns dipped 39% in its fourth flight to an estimated $7.5M and pushed its cume to $178.4M. The pricey Warner Bros. film is still ahead of the $171.9M that its last super hero film Batman Begins collected after the same amount of time. The Caped Crusader pic, however, held up better grossing $10M in its fourth frame. The $200M domestic mark still seems reachable for Superman. Overseas, the international cume climbed to $110M.Meryl Streep’s hit comedy The Devil Wears Prada enjoyed another solid hold suffering the smallest decline in the top ten. The Fox release took in an estimated $7.4M, off only 29%, to lift its sum to $97.6M. Devil opened on the same weekend as Superman Returns with a much smaller gross, but is now doing nearly identical weekend business.Disney bookended the top ten with its Pixar smash Cars which dropped 37% to an estimated $4.9M in its seventh lap. The animated hit has now grossed $229.4M putting it at number 49 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters after X-Men: The Last Stand which opened two weeks earlier and has taken in $232.8M to date.The weekend’s four new releases tossed a quartet of summer pictures out of the top ten. Adam Sandler’s latest winner Click grossed an estimated $4M in its fifth frame, off 45%, for a total of $128.2M. The $83M Sony title should finish with $135-140M. Fellow comedy Nacho Libre with Jack Black tumbled 69% to an estimated $505,000 for a cume of $78.7M to date. Paramount looks to end its run with just under $80M.Keanu Reeves grossed an estimated $661,000 for his sci-fi toon A Scanner Darkly and an estimated $625,000 for his sci-fi romance The Lake House this weekend. Warner Independent Pictures has taken in $3.2M with Scanner and is shooting for the $5M mark. Parent company Warner Bros. has grossed $50.7M with its Sandra Bullock tale and is heading for $52M.The global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth remains a popular summer flick slipping just 14% to an estimated $1M in its ninth weekend. Paramount Vantage has collected $18.8M to date and is enjoying remarkable momentum.The top ten films grossed an estimated $138.2M which was up 12% from last year when Johnny Depp’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory remained at number one for the second time with $28.3M; and up 2% from 2004 when Matt Damon‘s The Bourne Supremacy opened in the top spot with $52.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"blockbusters, service, directors, hist, DC","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Pirates-Passes-300M-Lady-Stumbles"},{"id":"47509161696391","title":"Box Office Preview: \"Snakes\" Prepares For Takeoff","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: \"Snakes\" Prepares For Takeoffby RT Staff | August 17, 2006 |  CommentsThis weekend Samuel L. Jackson looks to seize control of the muthaf*ckin’ box office with his new muthaf*ckin’ film \"Snakes on a Plane\" which invades theaters on a wave of internet buzz.It should be a smooth trip to number one for the action thriller which will face competition from the teen comedies \"Accepted\" and \"Material Girls\" plus the expansion of the indie darling \"Little Miss Sunshine.\" After two weeks in the top spot, Will Ferrell‘s hit comedy \"Talladega Nights\" will decelerate and lose pole position, but will have the distinction of crossing the celebrated $100M mark.All eyes are on Sam Jackson this weekend as his much-blogged-about action vehicle \"Snakes on a Plane\" makes its way into theaters. The R-rated film presents an old fashioned good guy versus bad guy story with the former Mace Windu playing an FBI agent assigned to escort a key witness to a mob murder on a flight from Hawaii to Los Angeles. When the crime boss masterminds a plan to unleash poisonous snakes mid-flight, all hell breaks loose. New Line has no ambitions of winning Oscars here. \"Snakes\" is pure entertainment aimed at giving fans a thrill ride for two hours. No advance screenings are being held for the media which is usually a sign that the studio believes that the reviews will only trash the picture so why waste the time and money?No R-rated film this year has broken the $30M mark on opening weekend. In fact, in the past two years, only a pair of R pics have opened north of that mark – last year’s duo of \"Saw II\" with $31.7M and \"Wedding Crashers\" with $33.9M. \"Snakes\" will be relying on an adult male audience for its ticket sales with older teens and twentysomethings being the driving force. Jackson may also be able to pull in African American audiences given his stature and the type of role he is playing. Typically, the Oscar-nominated actor does not have much box office muscle when anchoring a film solo. But the buzz and media coverage surrounding \"Snakes\" has almost made it into a franchise.With so many on the internet buzzing about the movie since the beginning of the year, uploading their own trailers and \"Snakes\"-related videos, and pushing for more violence and profanity, the fans have gotten a sense of empowerment. They feel like they have been part of the filmmaking process and you can be sure that they will be out when the film opens to see the final product. And since everyone knows that the film will be cheesy and that there are no press screenings, expectations are not too high. Without all the hoopla, this film would only be seen as action movie number ten that Hollywood churns out for the summer season. New Line is taking the step of launching \"Snakes\" a day early on Thursday night with showtimes starting at 10pm.August has been a great month for these types of action films for young males. Three years ago, the studio opened the R-rated horror flick \"Freddy vs. Jason\" to $36.4M while a year later, Fox found a $38.3M bow for its PG-13 sci-fi pic \"Alien vs. Predator.\" Jackson’s film lacks a franchise following, although the hype has generated a sizable built-in audience of its own. \"Snakes\" will come and go quickly from theaters. A strong start should be followed by massive erosion, but with a reported budget of only $30M, it can’t lose money. Plus Jackson has done a commendable job hitting the trail and promoting his new flick. Attacking over 3,300 theaters, \"Snakes on a Plane\" could open with around $28M this weekend.Universal is hoping that those too young for \"Snakes,\" but who are still looking for some late-summer fun, will line up for its new comedy \"Accepted.\" The PG-13 film stars Justin Long as a high school senior rejected by every college he applies to who then decides to make up his own fake university. The under-25 set is the target audience here with teens who can relate to the character’s nightmare making up the bulk of the crowd. Recent young-skewing hits like \"Step Up\" and \"John Tucker Must Die\" have proven that no-star vehicles with an interesting concept can lure in solid numbers on opening weekend. Those films debuted to $14.3M and $20.7M, respectively. Studios have done a poor job satisfying teenagers in recent weeks with their big ticket items which has only helped these low-cost pictures. \"Accepted\" will certainly have to face \"Snakes\" taking away older guys and \"Step Up\" in its second weekend stealing away the gals. But the concept is a good one and with so many young people getting ready to head back to campus, memories of rejection letters will come flying back. Marketing materials register some laughs too and appeal to both genders is there. Entering over 2,700 locations, \"Accepted\" could open with around $12M this weekend.Hilary and Haylie Duff graduate from the world of breath mint commercials to feature films in \"Material Girls\" from director Martha Coolidge (\"Real Genius,\" \"The Prince and Me\"). The PG-rated film finds the sisters playing heiresses to a cosmetics fortune who stumble upon bankruptcy. Anjelica Huston co-stars. The MGM release will play primarily to a female audience of teens and pre-teens. Males interested in buying tickets should number about three. \"Material Girls\" is not getting too big of a push and with \"Step Up\" doing so well with the same demographic, it will be an uphill battle attracting business. Once a potent asset, Hilary has lost much of her pull at the box office with recent clunkers like \"Raise Your Voice\" and \"The Perfect Man\" landing poor debuts of only $4M and $5.3M, respectively.. The Duffs may end up taking a lesson from the Olsen twins whose own film \"New York Minute\" opened a week after the bow of 2004’s surprise teen girl hit \"Mean Girls\" and ended up being squashed with a weak $6M debut from over 3,000 theaters. \"Material Girls\" will enter only 1,509 playdates and could settle for an opening of just $4M.After three weeks of sparkling results in limited release, Fox Searchlight’s comedy sensation \"Little Miss Sunshine\" expands nationally into 694 locations from its current run in 153 sites. Last weekend, the R-rated dysfunctional family pic averaged a stunning $17,014 which is one of the best showings in recent years for a film playing in 100-200 locations. With strong reviews and positive word-of-mouth, \"Sunshine\" should jump into the top ten this weekend and could gross about $5M pushing its cume into double-digit millions.Searchlight also debuts its next indie flick \"Trust the Man\" which opens in 37 theaters in selected cities on Friday. The R-rated dramedy stars Billy Crudup, David Duchovny, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Julianne Moore, and Eva Mendes and tells the story of two New York couples going through relationship troubles. Moore’s real-life husband Bart Freundlich directs. \"Trust the Man\" has garnered mixed reviews from critics and will expand nationwide on September 8.Also opening in limited release, but attracting more glowing praise from critics, is the dramatic thriller \"The Illusionist.\" Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, and Jessica Biel star in the PG-13 film which finds a turn-of-the-century magician battling wits with a Vienna cop. Two weeks after the limited bow, Yari Film Group will expand \"Illusionist\" wide over the Labor Day holiday weekend.A variable that could affect moviegoing behavior this weekend could be all the current stories in the news this week that have connections to major films in release. Tapes of 911 calls from victims of the World Trade Center disaster have been released after nearly five years. New terror plots aboard commercial planes have dominated the headlines lately, and a new arrest in the Jonbenet Ramsey case has brought attention back to little girls in beauty pageants. How this news coverage will affect the grosses for films like \"Snakes on a Plane,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" and \"World Trade Center\" is anyone’s guess. But at a time of year when moviegoing typically slows down anyway, some potential ticket buyers may decide to look elsewhere for their weekend entertainment.Will Ferrell’s \"Talladega Nights\" looks to race past the $100M mark by the end of its second full week in theaters. The Sony hit won’t win a third box office crown, but it should remain in the top five and drop 45% to about $12M. That would give the racing comedy $113M in 17 days making it the comedian’s second biggest hit ever, in a leading role, behind \"Elf\" which took in $173.4M.Last weekend’s surprise smash \"Step Up\" is not afraid of \"Snakes on a Plane\" which is likely to tap into an older and more male audience. Instead, Buena Vista’s dance drama will see its competition come from \"Accepted\" and \"Material Girls.\" Word-of-mouth for \"Step Up\" has been encouraging with the film averaging a solid B+ from over 5,500 users of Yahoo Movies. Still, teen pics tend to fall fast so a 50% decline would give the film around $10M for the weekend and a stellar ten-day total of $40M.Paramount’s \"World Trade Center\" got off to a healthy start at the box office and is also generating positive buzz from moviegoers. Competition is not too fierce this weekend for adults looking for mature fare so a 35% drop would give the Oliver Stone movie roughly $12M and a cume of $46M after 12 days.LAST YEAR: The surprise comedy hit \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" debuted at number one with a better-than-expected weekend opening of $21.4M. Universal’s R-rated smash displayed strong legs in the weeks ahead and ended up scoring $109.3M. Settling for second place in its first flight was the DreamWorks thriller \"Red Eye\" with a solid $16.2M on its way to $57.9M. Rounding out the top five were holdovers \"Four Brothers\" with $12.5M, \"Wedding Crashers\" with $8M and \"The Skeleton Key\" with $7.7M. The frame’s two other new releases were mostly ignored by moviegoers. Disney’s animated pic \"Valiant\" bowed to $5.9M for eighth place while Fox’s action drama \"Supercross\" crashed into 15th place with a dismal $1.3M opening weekend. Final tallies reached $19.5M and $3.1M, respectively.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Oscars, Rock","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Snakes-Prepares-For-Takeoff"},{"id":"47509161694342","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Snakes Opens at #1, But Lacks Bite","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Snakes Opens at #1, But Lacks Biteby Gitesh Pandya | August 20, 2006 |  CommentsSamuel L. Jackson‘s much-talked-about thriller Snakes on a Plane landed in first place at the North American box office this weekend, but lacked the kind of bite that was expected given all the media attention and internet buzz that surrounded the film.The weekend’s two other new releases Accepted and Material Girls targeted teens and met with only mild-to-moderate results. However, the indie comedy Little Miss Sunshine flexed some muscle in its national expansion jumping into the top ten in its fourth weekend of release. Former number one Talladega Nights raced past the $100M mark while Pirates of the Caribbean cruised past the $400M milestone this weekend. However, the late-summer slowdown took its toll on the box office as for the first time in fourteen weeks, the top ten failed to top $100M.A number one box office performance…does not a franchise make.Following months of online buzz which translated into tons of national publicity, Snakes on a Plane finally arrived in theaters and collected an estimated $15.3M over the weekend including about $1.4M in Thursday night preview grosses. Taking off in an ultrawide 3,555 theaters, the R-rated film averaged a mediocre $4,290 per site. Of the 62 films in history that have opened in 3,500 or more theaters, 61 have grossed more than Snakes on opening weekend. Only last summer’s Herbie: Fully Loaded fared worse with $12.7M from 3,521 sites following a Wednesday bow. Snakes also suffered the second lowest gross for a number one opener this year after Glory Road‘s $13.6M top spot bow in January.Since no film before it had generated the same type of grassroots hype, expectations varied greatly leading into the frame with most believing it would at least surpass the $20M mark. The New Line release finds Jackson playing an FBI agent escorting a key witness on a commercial airliner when deadly snakes are let loose. The studio did not screen the film for the media ahead of the release. Fans on the internet have been talking up the picture since last year creating a cult fan following which no one knew how to measure when it came to box office sales. Ultimately, Snakes did not appear to have had much appeal outside of its core fan base of young men. With a budget of only $30M, Snakes on a Plane should still end up being a moneymaker for New Line after worldwide DVD sales are tallied. However, hopes for a new franchise seem to have been crushed.\"Talladega Nights:\" still reeling in moviegoersAfter two weeks in pole position, Will Ferrell‘s hit comedy Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby finished close behind in second place this weekend with an estimated $14.1M in its third lap. The Sony release dropped only 36% and showed good legs. On Thursday, Talladega became the eleventh film of the year to cross the $100M mark and has pushed its total to $114.7M after 17 days. Snakes led all films at the box office on Friday, but Ricky Bobby raced ahead on both Saturday and Sunday.Oliver Stone‘s 9/11 drama World Trade Center enjoyed a good hold in its second weekend grossing an estimated $10.8M. Down a moderate 42%, the Paramount release upped its total to $45M after 12 days. The $65M film looks to reach about $70M domestically.Universal’s new teen comedy Accepted bowed in fourth place with an estimated $10.1M from 2,914 theaters. The PG-13 film about a high school senior who forms the fictitious S.H.I.T. (South Harmon Institute of Technology) after being rejected by every other college averaged a mild $3,470 per location. Budgeted at $23M, Accepted appealed mostly to a teen and young adult audience with studio research showing that a whopping 74% of the crowd was under 25. Males slightly outnumbered females with 52% of the audience.Last weekend’s surprise hit Step Up fell an understandable 52% in its second session taking in an estimated $9.9M for fifth place. Buena Vista’s low-budget dance drama has captured a robust $39.4M in ten days and could end its run with a terrific $60M. At the beginning of August, no one thought that Step Up would score a bigger opening than Snakes on a Plane. The animated comedy Barnyard followed with an estimated $7.5M dropping only 23%. The strong hold for the Paramount release helped boost the cume to $46M after 17 days.\"Little Miss Sunshine,\" no longer just an indie hit?Boasting the best per-theater average in the top ten by far was indie sensation Little Miss Sunshine which expanded nationally and grossed an estimated $5.7M. Fox Searchlight’s dysfunctional family comedy averaged a stellar $8,213 from 691 locations after widening from 153 playdates last weekend. Cume to date stands at $12.8M with much more to come. The distributor reported that the Greg Kinnear–Steve Carell pic is broadening its audience beyond just the arthouse crowd and is now playing well in mainstream multiplexes in suburban markets. Sunshine will double its theater count on Friday with over 1,400 runs and will add a few hundred more the following weekend for the Labor Day holiday frame.Disney’s unstoppable smash Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest ranked eighth this weekend with an estimated $5M in its seventh voyage. Down only 31%, the Johnny Depp adventure broke the quadruple-century mark and pushed its cume to $401.1M in North America making it the seventh biggest domestic blockbuster ever trailing the $403.7M of 2002’s Spider-Man. Worldwide, the Pirates sequel cruised past the $900M mark this weekend and will break through the $1 billion barrier soon allowing it to join only Titanic and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in the ten-digit club.Opening quietly in ninth place were sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff with their comedy Material Girls which debuted with only $4.6M, according to estimates. Playing in 1,509 theaters, the MGM release averaged just $3,062 per site. The PG-rated story about wealthy sisters who must cope with being bankrupt opened much like Hilary Duff’s recent films Raise Your Voice ($4M in October 2004) and The Perfect Man ($5.3M in June 2005).Rounding out the top ten was the horror entry Pulse with an estimated $3.5M, off 57%, for a ten-day total of just $14.7M. The Weinstein Co. should reach a mere $20M with this one.\"The Illusionist,\" off to a good start in an expanding limited releaseThere was plenty of activity in limited release over the weekend. Yari Film Group opened its period mystery The Illusionist in 51 theaters and grossed an estimated $925,000 for a powerful $18,137 average. The Edward Norton–Paul Giamatti starrer earned strong reviews and will add more theaters on Friday before expanding nationwide on September 1.Fox Searchlight saw more modest results with its new relationship pic Trust the Man which debuted to an estimated $176,000 from 38 locations for a moderate $4,632 average. Playing in eight cities, the R-rated story stars Billy Crudup, David Duchovny, Julianne Moore, and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Trust will widen to more than 100 theaters on Friday. Reviews have been mixed.Four summer movies dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Lionsgate’s horror film The Descent fell 47% to an estimated $2.5M putting its total at $22.3M. The chicks-in-a-cave thriller should end with $27-29M. Sony’s Tim Allen flop Zoom declined 47% to an estimated $2.4M increasing its sum to a puny $9M. A horrendous final total of around $15M seems likely.Universal’s $135M cop pic Miami Vice dropped 50% to an estimated $2.4M in its fifth frame and lifted its sum to $59.8M. A disappointing $65M final seems likely. The $75M animated film Monster House grossed an estimated $1.9M, down 42%, for a cume of $67.3M. Sony should end up with a respectable $72M.Among holdovers in limited release, ThinkFilm’s critically-acclaimed drama Half Nelson added one theater and grossed an estimated $57,000 from three sites for a solid $19,067 average. The existing pair of theaters in Manhattan suffered almost no decline from last weekend and continued to sell out most of their weekend shows. Cume stands at $148,000 and the film debuts on Friday in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington D.C.The global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth became the highest-grossing film in company history for Paramount Classics this weekend. Al Gore‘s environmental pic took in an estimated $246,000 from 221 theaters and upped its total to $22.4M. The distributor’s previous top grosser was last summer’s Hustle &amp; Flow with $22.2M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $86.5M which was down 7% from last year when The 40-Year-Old Virgin debuted at number one with $21.4M; and down 10% from 2004 when Exorcist: The Beginning opened in the top spot with a robust $18.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"CW, of, History, jones","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Snakes-Opens-at-1-But-Lacks-Bite"},{"id":"47509161698440","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Talladega Nights\" Stays #1, \"Step Up\" Surprises","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Talladega Nights\" Stays #1, \"Step Up\" Surprisesby Gitesh Pandya | August 14, 2006 |  CommentsDespite a pair of newcomers close behind in its rearview mirror, Will Ferrell‘s hit comedy Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby finished in first place for the second consecutive weekend to retain its North American box office trophy.The frame’s biggest shocker came in second place with the stellar debut of the teen dance drama Step Up which flew past expectations to edge out Oliver Stone‘s high-profile 9/11 film World Trade Center which opened with solid results in third place. The new horror film Pulse launched in fifth place with mediocre results while Tim Allen‘s family film Zoom imploded with a disastrous bow in seventh place.Talladega Nights held onto the number one spot with an estimated $23M in its second weekend of release dropping an understandable 51%. The $73M Sony hit raced to a total of $91.2M after ten days of release and could find its way to the $140M mark.Getting high marks in the runnerup spot was Buena Vista’s Step Up which surprised the industry with a sizzling $21.1M opening weekend, according to estimates, from 2,467 theaters. The PG-13 pic about a trained ballerina who joins forces with a tough street dancer averaged a sturdy $8,539 per location and was powered primarily by teenage girls and young women. The surprise muscle of Step Up played out much like the bow of another late-summer film targeting teen girls – 2000’s Bring It On. That pic debuted at number one with $17.4M, spent two weeks at the top, and found its way to $68.4M followed by a pair of non-theatrical sequels keeping the franchise alive to this day.Oliver Stone’s 9/11 drama World Trade Center finished in third place grossing an estimated $19M over the weekend and $26.8M since debuting on Wednesday. Averaging a solid $6,431 from 2,957 theaters over the Friday-to-Sunday portion, the Paramount release stars Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as cops buried underneath the rubble of the collapsed Twin Towers. Reviews were mostly positive for the $65M film and word-of-mouth so far seems positive. Studio research showed that 91% of those polled called the disaster drama \"excellent\" or \"very good\".While young moviegoers were lining up for Step Up, World Trade Center skewed mostly to a mature adult audience with 65% of the crowd being over the age of 25. Females made up 55% of the audience. With good reviews, positive buzz, and almost no interesting films for adults opening in the coming weeks, World Trade Center could hold up well in the weeks ahead.Paramount’s animated comedy Barnyard dropped only 36% in its second weekend to an estimated $10.1M for fourth place. With $34.1M in the bank after ten days, the toon could find its way to about $60M. The PG-rated film’s budget was under $50M.The suspense thriller Pulse debuted in fifth with an estimated $8.5M from a launch in 2,323 sites. Averaging a mild $3,640 per location for The Weinstein Co., the PG-13 film made only a small dent in the overall box office.Disney took in an estimated $7.2M with its summer tentpole Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest lifting its incredible total to a towering $392.4M. The Johnny Depp smash fell just 35% and now sits at number seven on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters just behind Spider-Man which hauled in $403.7M in 2002. Overseas, there’s still no stopping Pirates which vaulted its international total to $463M pushing the global gross to a stunning $855M.Sony’s Tim Allen family pic Zoom crashed and burned in its debut grossing a measly $4.6M in its opening weekend. Playing in 2,501 theaters, the PG-rated film about an old super hero recruited to train a bunch of kids averaged an embarrassing $1,839 per venue.The horror flick The Descent dropped 48% in its second weekend to an estimated $4.6M and pushed its ten-day tally to a decent $17.5M. The Lionsgate release should dig up $25-27M by the end of its run. Universal’s action remake Miami Vice suffered another steep drop falling 56% to an estimated $4.5M for a $55.1M total. The animated pic Monster House rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.3M, off 46%, giving Sony $63.7M to date.Four more films were tossed right out of the top ten this weekend. Fox’s high school comedy John Tucker Must Die fell 52% to an estimated $3M in its third frame. With a solid $35.7M, the low-budget teen hit should finish with around $40M. Fellow comedy You, Me and Dupree grossed an estimated $1.9M, down 48%, and has collected $70.8M to date. Universal’s $54M pic is set to reach an impressive $74M.Not-so-impressive results came from The Ant Bully with an estimated $1.8M and The Night Listener with an estimated $1.4M. Tumbling 55%, the Warner Bros. toon has taken in just $22.4M and will stumble to about $25M. Miramax’s Robin Williams thriller has grossed a puny $6.3M for Miramax and could end up with only $8M.With Hollywood’s summer season of blockbusters coming to an end, plenty of activity was brewing over the weekend with limited release titles. ThinkFilm opened its critically-acclaimed indie Half Nelson in just two New York theaters but grossed a stellar $55,000, according to estimates. The R-rated drama about an inner city teacher with an addiction to crack averaged a potent $27,475 and expands to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington D.C. on August 25.Sony Classics premiered the Brazilian drama The House of Sand in five locations in New York and Los Angeles and grossed an estimated $33,000 for a moderate $6,600 average. The distributor’s teen pregnancy drama Quinceanera widened from eight to 27 theaters in its second weekend and grossed an estimated $138,000 giving the Sundance award winner a mild $5,111 average. Total to date stands at $278,000.Indie darling Little Miss Sunshine witnessed another powerful expansion widening from 58 to 153 locations for a weekend estimate of $2.6M and a sizzling average of $16,993. Fox Searchlight reported that audiences in the new cities are responding to the stellar word-of-mouth while theaters in existing markets are holding up remarkably well. The weekend decline among holdover theaters was only 17%. With $5.6M in the bank, look for Little Miss Sunshine to pop into the top ten next weekend when it expands into 600 playdates nationwide and remain there with a wider push into 1,500 locations the following frame. So far, the dysfunctional family comedy has performed even better than the distributor’s spring indie hit Thank You for Smoking as well as its 2004 hit Garden State which was released at this same time and in similar fashion. Those films went on to gross $24.7M and $26.8M, respectively.Paramount Vantage’s global warming film An Inconvenient Truth became the third biggest documentary of all time over the weekend. Al Gore‘s success story took in an estimated $367,000 in its 12th weekend and lifted its cume to $21.9M surpassing the $21.6M of 2002’s Oscar-winning doc Bowling for Columbine.The top ten films grossed an estimated $105.9M which was up 6% from last year when Four Brothers debuted at number one with $21.2M; but down 12% from 2004 when Alien vs. Predator opened in the top spot with a robust $38.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"spanish","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Talladega-Nights-Stays-1-Step-Up-Surprises"},{"id":"47509163330712","title":"Box Office Preview: Four New Films Prepare to Fight","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: Four New Films Prepare to Fightby Gitesh Pandya | June 15, 2006 |  CommentsReunion fever hits the multiplexes this weekend as four new releases debut bringing together a lot of familiar faces.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock reunite in the romantic drama The Lake House which will play to adult women, while Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties reassembles the cast of the first film in a new British adventure aimed at families. Another sequel taking a successful formula and transplanting it into another country is the action pic The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift which hopes to entice young guys. But the one new film which could flex the most muscle is Jack Black‘s wrestling comedy Nacho Libre which also will be attacking younger boys. With six films reaching double-digit millions last weekend, and four new potent entries opening on Friday, the marketplace will certainly be crowded.Fresh from his battle with the eighth wonder of the world, Jack Black returns to his bread and butter with the new Paramount comedy Nacho Libre. The PG-rated film is directed by Jared Hess, who helmed the 2004 sleeper hit Napoleon Dynamite, and sees Black playing a cook who moonlights as a masked grappler south of the border. Shooting directly for immature adolescents, Nacho is purely a marketing-driven film for summer kids. Rather than spend its time and money opening the door for hundreds of critics to pan the pic early on, Paramount has instead chosen to put all its force behind its advertising campaign and is so confident in the excitement it has been building, it is launching the film early on Thursday night with 10pm showtimes at select theaters across the country. Since the movie skews younger, the earlier time should make it more accessible than the standard midnight shows.Black certainly can shine in the comedy genre as evidenced by his 2003 hit School of Rock which opened at number one with $19.6M on its way to a robust $81.3M. Plus with Viacom sibling Nickelodeon adding its promotional muscle, and school children starting their summer vacations and looking for mindless entertainment to rot their brains, Nacho could be the hot item on the menu. Older boys may be distracted by the Fast and the Furious sequel this weekend which could put a limit on how high Nacho can fly. Plus the Disney/Pixar hit Cars is only in its second weekend so competition for kids will be fierce. Body slamming its foes in over 2,800 theaters, Nacho Libre might pin down about $24M over the weekend.Universal kicks in the nitrous oxide for a third time in its street racing actioner The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Ditching all the major stars of the first two installments (sort of), this PG-13 entry takes the tough-guy-likes-to-race-and-be-cool formula and moves the setting to Japan where an American must learn the local style of racing in order to score some street cred. Paul Walker who starred in the original 2001 surprise blockbuster and the very successful 2003 follow-up 2 Fast 2 Furious is nowhere to be found. Instead, the lead role is taken by Lucas Black (Friday Night Lights, Jarhead) while the rapper-turned-actor slot filled previously by Ja Rule and Ludacris now gets passed on to Bow Wow (Like Mike, Roll Bounce). With little starpower, concept will have to sell here.Since Drift is the third dip into the same well, and with the recognizable stars from before not starring again, some fans of the previous films will wait for this one on a \"tricked out\" DVD. Young guys are the core audience here and with schools letting out for the summer, many will give Drift a chance hoping it will be a summer thrill ride. Acting and writing score pretty low in this one, but the target audience is not likely to care too much since there is an abundance of hot cars and hot babes. But Nacho Libre could put a dent in the grosses since it will be stealing away many of the same young males this weekend. Tokyo Drift is not likely to reach the openings of the first two Furious pics which bowed to $40.1M and $50.5M, respectively. Speeding into 3,027 locations, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift may cross the finish line with around $21M.Twelve years and one week after they crashed into theaters in Speed, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock reteam but this time in a romantic drama starring in The Lake House. A remake of the Korean film Il Mare, the PG-rated film tells the story of a man and woman, two years apart in time, who communicate with each other through the mailbox of a lake house and fall in love. Sci-fi and romance don’t snuggle up too often, so this Warner Bros. release prides itself on a story that has a unique twist to it. But it’s really the starpower that will drive sales for The Lake House. These actors look good together and mature adults will be sold. In some ways, Lake House resembles the Al Pacino-Robert De Niro actioner Heat in that moviegoers will be drawn in by two leads who hardly share any actual screen time together. But that shouldn’t matter to Speed freaks everywhere who would love to see Reeves and Bullock back together again without a looney Dennis Hopper trying to blow them up.Adult women will overwhelmingly make up the audience here. Lake House should play to the same crowd that came out for two other star-driven films aimed at older women in the first half of the summer of 2002. The Richard Gere–Diane Lane drama Unfaithful opened to $14.1M and a $5,383 average in May while Bullock’s Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood debuted to $16.2M and a $6,449 average a month later. Many of the same folks will hit theaters this weekend. Competition will come from The Break-Up which also has been skewing heavily female although Cars will be a factor as well since it has been pulling in moms with small children. Given the ages of the stars, Lake House should also do well with twentysomething single women too. Opening in 2,645 theaters, The Lake House could open with about $17M this weekend.Breckin Meyer, Jennifer Love Hewitt, and the vocal chords of Bill Murray reunite for the family comedy Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties. The PG-rated film is the sequel to Fox’s Garfield: The Movie which was a solid hit two years ago when it opened to $21.7M on its way to $75.4M domestically and nearly $200M worldwide. With strong international sales, and further success on video and television, the studio decided that a sequel could bring in more profits. This new tale finds everyone’s favorite fat cat going to England where he is mistaken for a local feline who is royalty. The studio has had a tough problem finding the right release date. Garfield was originally scheduled to open next Friday, one week ahead of Superman Returns, but was moved up one week and now must face the sophomore frame of Cars which is already doing brisk biz with the exact same audience.While the first film was successful, it did not become the type of pop culture smash that had fans demanding more. Fox’s best bet might be with families that already came out to see the Pixar toon. Long-term success may also be tough since kids of all ages will have interest in seeing the Man of Steel. The studio’s marketing push has been commendable and there is somewhat of a built-in fan base the film will tap into. But it may find itself on the same path as the Scooby Doo sequel which went on to gross 45% less than its predecessor. Opening in over 2,900 theaters, Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties might debut with around $14M this weekend.Opening in a pair of New York sites is the IFC Films release Wordplay, a documentary that looks at The New York Times crossword puzzles and the celebs that just can’t get enough of them. The PG-rated film played at the Sundance and Tribeca film festivals earlier this year and features commentary from such crossword fans as Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, and Jon Stewart. The former commander-in-chief even snagged the coveted \"and\" credit.With all the new drivers on the highway, Cars will try to stay ahead of the pack and hold onto pole position in its second lap. The Disney/Pixar film’s $60.1M bow was slightly below what the industry was expecting given the track record of the pair’s previous computer animated movies. However, their digital toons usually have good legs and with more kids getting out of school this week, a solid sophomore performance should result. The Incredibles dropped only 29% in its second weekend in November 2004 while Finding Nemo slipped 34% in June 2003.Cars has been holding up well mid-week as its target audience has become more available. Although it opened behind the $68M launch of Ice Age: The Meltdown this past spring, the stronger weekday business should allow Cars to match or exceed the $81.9M gross that the prehistoric sequel collected in its first seven days. Garfield will take away some of the family audience and Nacho Libre should distract many young boys so competition will be fierce. A 45% drop for Cars would give the toon about $33M for the frame keeping it in the number one spot. That would give Disney a robust $115M in ten days.Keanu and Sandra will steal away the attention of women from Vince and Jennifer this weekend. The Break-Up will face direct competition from The Lake House for its core audience of adult females so another sizable drop could be in the works. A 40% fall would give Universal a weekend tally of around $12M pushing the 17-day cume to a still-impressive $94M.Fox grabbed $16M and change last weekend with each of its films X-Men: The Last Stand and The Omen. The mutant saga could see sales get sliced in half while the horror remake, because of its mid-week launch, might suffer a slightly smaller decline. This weekend could find Omen taking in roughly $9M for a $50M total and X-Men grossing about $8M boosting its cume to $216M making it the top-grossing installment of the franchise.LAST YEAR: Super hero power hit the box office with the top spot debut of Batman Begins which relaunched a profitable franchise for Warner Bros. with its $48.7M opening weekend. Bowing on Wednesday, the Caped Crusader grossed a solid $72.9M over five days and went on to display good legs reaching $205.3M domestically and over $370M worldwide. The rest of the top films all got bumped down a notch by the Dark Knight. Fox’s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith placed second with $26M in its sophomore frame while DreamWorks followed with Madagascar which took in $10.7M in its fourth adventure. Fox reappeared in the number four slot with $10M for Star Wars Episode III and Paramount rounded out the top five with The Longest Yard which scored $8.2M. The only other new wide release to challenge Batman was the chick flick The Perfect Man starring Hilary Duff and Heather Locklear. The Universal title opened to just $5.3M on its way to $16.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Netflix, Star, BET, YA, CBS, new, winner, Classic, Emmy, free, what","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Four-New-Films-Prepare-to-Fight"},{"id":"47509163344028","title":"Box Office Preview: Jen and Vince Ready to Rumble","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: Jen and Vince Ready to Rumbleby Gitesh Pandya | June 1, 2006 |  CommentsHow much money will moviegoers spend on watching two celebrities yell and scream at each other for 106 minutes? That is the question that Universal, and the film industry in general, will be asking itself with the opening of The Break-Up, the new romantic comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston.Just like with last weekend, the frame only boasts one wide release hitting the multiplexes. In scheduling their summer, studios are more likely to have wanted to avoid clashing with the second weekend of X-Men: The Last Stand, than to not go head to head with the swinger and the friend. After a record-breaking bow, the mutant sequel aims to keep its command over the North American box office for the second straight week.There have been no major star-driven romantic comedies in nearly three months so Universal hopes to fill the void with The Break-Up. Directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On, Down with Love), the PG-13 concoction is aimed at adult couples with a clearly-defined premise that most can relate to. Vaughn plays a tour bus operator while Aniston plays an art gallery worker. As boyfriend and girlfriend, the two own and live in a spacious Chicago condo, but when they go splitsville, each refuses to move out and the former lovers must learn how to co-exist as just roommates.Break-Up looks to play to an adult audience and females will surely outnumber dudes. Vaughn has been a rising box office powerhouse in recent years drawing in more moviegoers each year when anchoring comedies. In 2003, Old School was a leggy hit taking in $75.6M while 2004’s summer smash Dodgeball hit the mark with $114.3M. Last summer though, the funnyman struck gold twice with a supporting role in the former Mr. Aniston’s action hit Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith followed by Wedding Crashers which became the sleeper hit of the season zooming to $209.2M. The Break-Up will end that streak, unfortunately.Vaughn excels at delivering guy humor opposite funny male co-stars. But this time, he is asked to star opposite a woman and still try to make ticket buyers laugh. Although the highlights of the film revolve around his humor, The Break-Up just doesn’t pack enough laughs to be a huge hit. In fact, the constant fighting between the two lead characters will put off many. What the filmmakers don’t realize is that couples actually go to the movies to get away from that sort of thing. Starpower, tabloid gossip, a lack of comedies, and a decent marketing push will help pump up the opening, but word-of-mouth should lead to hefty declines in the weeks ahead. Bad reviews are not going to help either.The Universal release has gotten months of free publicity from the endless media attention on the off-screen relationship between Aniston and Vaughn. Last weekend’s birth of Pitt and Angelina Jolie‘s baby has also added some free plugs too. The Break-Up should attract the same crowd that spent $24.4M on the opening of March’s Failure to Launch, although the grosses could be a bit higher since the starpower is arguably greater this time. Competition should not be too much of a factor this weekend. With no other new films in national release, the entertainment media will focus fully on this one. Plus, X-Men and Over the Hedge are playing to different audience segments. The only direct foe it will face is The Da Vinci Code which has been drawing in tons of adult women over the last couple of weeks. Opening in 3,065 theaters, The Break-Up could debut with about $26M this weekend.Mutant fever ruled the box office last weekend with X-Men: The Last Stand opening to a record $122.9M over four days. That was nearly $3M better than originally estimated giving Fox an explosive start to what could be its final film of the franchise. Super hero pics and sequels tend to fall hard on the second weekend and coming off of a huge holiday bow will certainly up the decline as well. Last weekend’s Friday gross included sales from midnight shows on Thursday night while Sunday was stronger than usual thanks to the Monday holiday.However, X-Men is not facing much new competition since the Aniston crowd does not consist of too many Magneto fans. Two years ago, Fox launched its effects-driven actioner The Day After Tomorrow over the Memorial Day frame and saw its Friday-to-Sunday gross tumble 60% on the second weekend. The weather disaster pic also had the towering $93.7M opening of the third Harry Potter film to deal with so some of the fall was attributed to the new kid on the block. The first two X-Men films debuted over non-holiday frames and dropped by 57% and 53% respectively in their sophomore sessions. X2 faced only one new opener in its second mission helping to soften the blow.With more upfront demand and a holiday start, The Last Stand should fall harder. A 60% drop from the massive $102.8M three-day bow would give Fox about $41M for the weekend and the top spot once again. The ten-day cume for the latest adventure from the mutant heroes would shoot to a stunning $183M. With $700M in global grosses from the first two films, the X-Men trilogy should break through the $1 billion milestone in worldwide box office this weekend.After suffering a steep 56% second weekend decline, The Da Vinci Code showed that long legs are not in its future. Add in the fact that The Break-Up will steal away many adult couples and it looks like another rocky frame for the Tom Hanks mystery. The Friday-to-Sunday take could drop 50% this time around and pull in about $17M. That would give Sony a still-impressive $170M in 17 days.As Da Vinci fades away this weekend, so will Sony’s market share lead for the year. The studio has dominated for much of the year with six number one openings and more wide releases than any other studio. However, with the surging strength of X-Men, plus grosses from the year’s number one blockbuster Ice Age: The Meltdown, Fox looks to capture the market share lead by Sunday. As of the end of Memorial Day, both studios had about 18% of the box office pie year-to-date with Sony’s $608M sitting $18M ahead of Fox. That lead will be erased this weekend as the two distributors will swap positions but more shifting is likely to occur throughout the summer.Paramount’s backyard adventure Over the Hedge will remain the only major option for little kids so a good hold is likely. A 40% drop from last weekend’s Friday-to-Sunday tally should lead to a $16M frame and a 17-day cume of $107M. All other holdovers should drift away with less than $5M a piece.LAST YEAR Memorial Day weekend leftovers ruled the charts as the top three films remained the same, although some musical chairs led to a new order. The DreamWorks toon Madagascar rose from second to first place with $28.1M in its sophomore weekend pushing its ten-day cume to a solid $100.4M. Adam Sandler‘s comedy The Longest Yard also climbed a notch taking second scoring $26.1M. The Paramount remake pushed its sum to $95.8M in ten days. After two weeks on top, Star Wars Episode III tumbled 55% and placed third with $25.1M but watched its overall domestic gross soar to $307.9M. No other film in the year since has reached the triple century mark. Among new releases, Universal’s early Oscar contender Cinderella Man debuted in fourth with a weaker-than-expected $18.3M. The Russell Crowe drama went on to punch up $61.6M. Bowing in fifth was the estrogen pic The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants with $9.8M while opening in seventh was the testosterone film Lords of Dogtown with $5.6M. Cumes reached a commendable $39M and a dismal $11M, respectively.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Family, Prime, laika","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Jen-and-Vince-Ready-to-Rumble"},{"id":"47509163314326","title":"Box Office Preview: Sandler \"Clicks\" With New Comedy","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: Sandler \"Clicks\" With New Comedyby Gitesh Pandya | June 22, 2006 |  CommentsAlthough Father’s Day has passed, Hollywood brings out two very different stories about dads and their wacky adventures this weekend with Adam Sandler‘s comedy Click and Tyrese Gibson‘s actioner Waist Deep, both opening in theaters on Friday. Comedy has been ruling the box office throughout the month of June and that trend should continue until the Man of Steel arrives next week.Looking for his seventh trip across the $100M mark, Adam Sandler returns to the big screen with his latest comedy Click. Released by his favorite studio Sony, the PG-13 pic tells the story of a man who comes across a magical remote control that gives him the power to manipulate his whole world, from his family at home to his boss at work. Frank Coraci follows up The Wedding Singer and The Waterboy by directing the funnyman for a third time while Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, Kate Beckinsale, and Henry Winkler co-star. Sandler, who turns forty this year, is moving on from his slacker roles playing a husband and father. This makes sense as his fan base is aging too.The comedian typically picks films with unique concepts and Click is no different. The story is not run-of-the-mill, but an interesting what-if scenario that will make audiences curious. Trailers and commercials have been funny so another blockbuster that satisfies moviegoers is in the works. Over the last eight years, Sandler has seen his bigger hits like Waterboy, Big Daddy, Anger Management, Mr. Deeds, and 50 First Dates all open in the $37-42M range with opening weekend averages of more than $11,000 each time. His most recent film The Longest Yard scored a bit better last summer opening to $47.6M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the long Memorial Day holiday weekend. The guy comes out with about one movie per year so audiences don’t get too much of him.Young men make up the actor’s bread and butter, however you don’t open north of $40M by just appealing to this group. Female appeal is also solid with his films and Click should click with chicks too. Still, Nacho Libre and The Fast and the Furious sequel will be in their second weekends and even though both are expected to drop hard, the duo will still provide some competition for Sandler. However, since Waist Deep is looking to be a relatively small pic in the marketplace, this weekend shapes up to be one where Click is the only major new wide release. That should make frequent moviegoers like teens and twentysomethings look at it as the only new game in town.Sony has invested heavily in the marketing push and summer is a time when people want to laugh so the returns should be healthy. Opinions of critics should not matter much. One of the most reliable box office draws around, Adam Sandler will see the widest opening of his career with a launch in 3,748 theaters this weekend. That could push Click to around $43M over the Friday-to-Sunday span.Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-con on a fast and furious hunt to get back his kidnapped son in the new action drama Waist Deep from Focus Features’ Rogue Pictures division. Directed by Vondie Curtis Hall (Glitter, Gridlock’d), the R-rated film also stars Meagan Good, Larenz Tate and hip hop star The Game. Gibson jumped from the modeling world into movies and has become a player although his roles have always been opposite other established box office draws. This time, he anchors solo as none of his co-stars have a track record of opening films on their own.Waist Deep will play primarily to an urban audience with African Americans making up the largest component. Whites are not likely to show much interest. This same audience powered ATL to a stellar $11.6M bow from 1,602 theaters this past spring. However, Waist does not seem to have the same level of hype plus it will debut in fewer theaters. Most of the film’s competition will come from The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift which is likely to fall sharply this weekend. The marketing push has been targeted and is trying to appeal to fans of The Game who in recent years has developed a large fan base. Opening in 1,004 theaters, Waist Deep might shoot up about $6M this weekend.Opening in limited release this weekend, Roadside Attractions offers the controversial film The Road to Guantanamo which tells the story of a group of Pakistani men from England who are detained while traveling to Afghanistan and imprisoned and tortured by the U.S. military. Told through a mix of interviews with survivors and re-enactments of the events, the R-rated pic won the best director prize at this year’s Berlin Film Festival and hits 15 theaters in North America before expanding.After two laps as box office champ, the Disney/Pixar animated hit Cars looks to decelerate some more this weekend for a second place finish. The film’s 43% second weekend decline was the biggest for any Pixar toon since 1999’s Toy Story 2 which was coming off of a Thanksgiving holiday launch. Cars should see its drop stabilize since this weekend’s offerings should not pull away too many young children. A decline of 40% to about $20M could result giving the Lightning McQueen pic $152M in 17 days.Jack Black flexed some amazing muscles last weekend with the debut of Nacho Libre. Adam Sandler will provide some stiff competition for young males so a sizable drop of 50% could occur giving Paramount a weekend take of around $14M. That would still give the wrestling comedy a solid $54M in ten days.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift also debuted impressively last weekend tapping into a similar audience, but a steep sophomore crash is imminent. The last film in the franchise, 2003’s 2 Fast 2 Furious, tumbled 63% in its second race. This latest Universal sequel has also burned through its upfront crowd plus will face competition for young guys from Click and for the urban audience from Waist Deep. A hefty 60% fall would leave Tokyo Drift with $9M for the weekend and $42M in ten days.Keanu and Sandra snuggled up to a decent, but not spectacular, opening for their romance The Lake House. Adult women will not be too distracted by the new options so a moderate 40% drop could result. That would give the Warner Bros. release $8M for the frame and a ten-day tally of $29M.LAST YEAR: Topping the charts for a second straight weekend, Batman Begins grossed $27.6M dropping 43% from its opening giving Warner Bros. an encouraging hold. Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell powered their new comedy Bewitched into the number two slot opening with $20.1M. The Sony release found its way to $62.3M. Fox’s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith placed third with $16.8M in its third fight. Two new releases rounded out the top ten. Disney’s Lindsay Lohan film Herbie: Fully Loaded opened to $12.7M and $17.7M over five days, while Universal’s zombie flick Land of the Dead bowed to $10.2M. Final grosses reached $66M and $20.5M, respectively. In limited release, the inner city dancing documentary Rize opened to $1.6M from 352 theaters for a $4,474 average putting it in 12th place. Lions Gate collected $3.3M by the end of its short run.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"movies, elevated, Games, remakes, All, thriller","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Sandler-Clicks-With-New-Comedy"},{"id":"47509207948845","title":"Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Stories of 2013","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Stories of 2013\n                        Recounting the best movie news announced each month of this past year.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 27, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nFew industries enjoy taking really, really, really long extended holiday vacations like Hollywood. So when we get to this time of the year, there’s really not much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss, especially not in a weekly column which normally includes 10 different stories. So, this week and next, we’re instead going to review 12 of the year’s top stories, presented to you in monthly chronology. The year-in-review begins with the “Fresh Developments” which here also serve (mostly) as the “Top Stories” of the year.  And there was no confusion about what the year’s top story was…\n\n\n\nTop Story of the Year\n\t\nBEN AFFLECK CAST AS BATMAN IN MAN OF STEEL SEQUEL\n\nThere are obviously dozens of movie development news stories every week (this column presents ten stories, usually culled from twenty to thirty stories, every week).  The year of 2013 had one story, however, that was clearly on a completely different level. You could not use any sort of social media in late August, 2013 and not read someone complaining about this one. And yes, obviously, that could be an argument that it was a “Rotten Idea,” but we also don’t know what the finished movie will be like, two years from now. The story in question was, of course, the announcement that Ben Affleck had been cast as the next Batman in the Man of Steel sequel. The studio people at Warner Bros surely knew any big announcement would have its detractors, but given what 2013 had otherwise been like for Ben Affleck (ie, Argo), the amount of vitriol lobbed his way still had to surprise. The lingering question of “why” probably has to do with that other grim-and-gritty superhero movie Ben Affleck starred in: Daredevil. The Man of Steel sequel still lacks a proper title (unless it really is Batman vs Superman like some sites list it). The other big story that could have been included if Ben Affleck didn’t lead such a long shadow was the recent casting of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman in the same movie. And that wasn’t the only time Ben Affleck’s casting pre-empted this movie, as there was also the June news that the sequel was being developed at all, and the Comic Con revelation that Batman would be in the movie. This story is also the monthly entry for August, in case anyone wonders why that month was skipped.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\nJANUARY: J.J. ABRAMS ANNOUNCED AS DIRECTOR OF STAR WARS EPISODE VII\n\nOne of the frequent theme of movie development news stories in 2012 was the ongoing rumor mill revolving around who would be hired by Disney to direct Star Wars Episode VII. Not that far into 2013, we learned that the job was going to a director who had actually already made his mark by rebooting a major science fiction franchise:  J.J. Abrams (Star Trek, LOST). Although we’re including this as a “Fresh Development” based on the RT Tomatometer scores for J.J. Abrams’ past films, there are clearly many fans who were not as enthused by Disney’s choice. Since this story came so early in the year, you might think it was just one of many revelations for Star Wars Episode VII, but really, we end the year 11 months later not knowing much more, except confirmation of the spinoffs, and a release date of December 18, 2015. Mostly, the year was filled with unsubstantiated casting rumors.  So, so, so many casting rumors. There were also two other big director announcements in January: Christopher Nolan replacing Steven Spielberg on Interstellar, and Duncan Jones signing on to direct Warcraft.\n\n\n\t\nFEBRUARY: PETER DINKLAGE JOINS THE X-FRANCHISE AS THE VILLAIN IN X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST\n\nIt’s curious how, in review, certain months have themes.  January, as just discussed, had a few major director announcements.  And in February, 2013, the recurring theme was talented actors getting jobs as antagonists in franchise entries. We can include in that list: James Marsden in the comedy sequel Anchorman 2, Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman as the lead humans in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and the casting of Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Given all of that competition, it might seem arbitrary that this story was chosen above them, but the shadow cast by Peter Dinklage in Game of Thrones goes a long way. His is a very big talent. Peter Dinklage has by this point already wrapped filming of his role in X-Men: Days of Future Past, which we now know is Bolivar Trask, the man behind the mutant-hunting robots called Sentinels. At the time, however, much of the speculation was based on Peter Dinklage’s height, namely that he might be playing the Canadian superhero Puck, despite there being no other indication that Puck or Alpha Flight would be in the movie (and oh yeah, Puck’s not a villain). This was just the first of several news stories for Fox’s superhero franchise in 2013, followed by X-Force being developed as a spinoff, and the announcement of the next movie being X-Men: Apocalypse, which is scheduled for May 27, 2016.\n\n\n\t\nMARCH: KICKSTARTER FUNDS THE VERONICA MARS MOVIE, AND KICKSTARTS A NEW FUNDING TREND\n\nThis is definitely a story whose “Freshness” is yet to be determined, but it was unquestionably one of the year’s biggest stories, from a certain perspective. Namely, the perspective of how Hollywood funds its movies, and how the industry takes advantage of online social networking. It was in March, 2013 that the Kickstarter campaign to fund a movie adaptation of the Veronica Mars TV series proved to be successful. Kristen Bell and crew have long since wrapped filming of the Veronica Mars movie, which is now scheduled for release by Warner Bros for March 14, 2014. That campaign’s success led to a few imitators, such as millionaire Spike Lee’s effort, and this now infamous example of how not to do it.\n\n\n\t\nAPRIL: PIXAR ANNOUNCES FINDING DORY, THE SEQUEL TO FINDING NEMO\n\nPixar sequels: yay or nay? That continues to be a source for discussion among fans of movies like Wall-E and Up, with the two Toy Story sequels holding up the other end of the discussion (and to a lesser extent, Cars 2 and Monsters University). One sequel which might help the pro-sequel side was announced back in early April with the confirmation that Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar are at work on Finding Dory, the sequel to the 2003 animated hit Finding Nemo. Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres (as the title character) are returning for the sequel, and new voice cast members include Ty Burrell, Diane Keaton, and Eugene Levy. Disney has scheduled Finding Dory for release on November 25, 2015. This is also a good place to acknowledge that this writer goofed at the time when he made G.I. Joe 3 news the top story instead of Finding Dory. Something that I got right, sort of, was when I did only one April Fool’s Day joke this year, and it was about Marvel’s The Defenders. Later in the year, The Defenders was announced as a major Netflix mini-series.  That jokes can become reality is what makes writing really good April Fool’s Day items so difficult some years.\n\n\n\t\nMAY: DIRECTOR SAM MENDES CONFIRMED AS RETURNING FOR JAMES BOND 24\n\nThe last week of May, and the first week of June, formed something of a double feature for news concerning James Bond 24 (title obviously to be changed). The first story was the bigger, which was that after some contrary reports, we learned that director Sam Mendes, who impressed so many with Skyfall, would be returning for the next James Bond movie as well. The second story involved the possibility of Penelope Cruz joining the film as the next “Bond girl.” That story was eventually debunked, but at the time, we didn’t know that.\n\n\n\t\nJUNE: SEQUELS IN THE WORKS FOR WORLD WAR Z AND THIS IS THE END\n\nTwo of the biggest hits of June, 2013 both involved the apocalypse: the R-rated comedy This is the End, and more surprisingly, the zombie blockbuster World War Z (which many pundits had formerly dismissed as an impending box office bomb). That both movies were successful was obvious by the last week of the month, and so we heard of sequel plans for both movies. We really haven’t heard much since about the Seth Rogen (and friends) sequel, but we know now that the World War Z sequel is being developed by a new franchise director, Juan Antonio Bayona (The Impossible).\n\n\n\t\nJULY: BEN AFFLECK TEAMING UP WITH DIRECTOR DAVID FINCHER FOR GONE GIRL\n\nA month later, Ben Affleck would be in the midst of an online publicity hurricane, but in July, the actor was receiving a lot more love, which, looking back, seems to now have been forgotten. It was in early July that Ben Affleck was announced as being cast as the lead in the novel adaptation Gone Girl, which is the next film for director David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network). 20th Century Fox has scheduled Gone Girl for release on October 3, 2014.\n\n\t\nSEPTEMBER: J.K. ROWLING RETURNING TO THE HARRY POTTER UNIVERSE WITH FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM\n\nWhen Warner Bros released Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 in 2011, it truly felt like an end of an era (and for good reason), but only a fool would have bet that the studio would never try returning to the world created by author J.K. Rowling. The event in 2013 that may have helped it all come together was the announcement that Legendary Pictures was leaving Warner Bros for Universal Pictures (an event that arguably impacted every decision Warner Bros made in the second half of 2013). Looking for future tentpoles to replace Legendary’s output, the studio announced plans to adapt J.K. Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as a new spinoff film that would potentially lead to a new franchise with sequels, etc.\n\n\n\t\nOCTOBER: MARTIN LUTHER KING JR FINALLY GETTING A HOLLYWOOD BIOPIC COURTESY OF OLIVER STONE\n\nThis writer has been covering movie development online since 1997, and one of the concepts that seems to have never really gone away ever since that period is a big screen biopic about civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. A book could be written (and probably will be) about the many different attempts at exactly that sort of movie. In October, we learned of negotiations between some of the elements, which include DreamWorks, Warner Bros, and director Oliver Stone (JFK, Nixon, W.), which seem to hint that the movie will finally happen. The crucial factor here is the actor who would play King, and we learned at that time that it was Jamie Foxx who the two studios and Oliver Stone were talking to for the role.\n\n\n\t\nNOVEMBER: SPINOFF MOVIES TO EXPAND A NEW CINEMATIC UNIVERSE AROUND THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN\n\nThere’s a funny thing that happens sometimes with online movie development news. There will be a big story, and it will get an appropriate amount of attention. Then, a few weeks later, basically the same story will come back with slightly more information, and the online communities will give it much more buzz and hype than it did the first time around, even as some people (like this writer, usually) say, “hey, we already knew this…” Such was the case with the November news that Sony Pictures is planning a new franchise of spinoff films featuring supporting characters and villains that they have the rights to because of their ongoing adaptations of Marvel’s The Amazing Spider-Man. At the time, the speculation about what characters would be adapted included Black Cat, Venom, and the Sinister Six. Well, three weeks later, there was another story saying almost exactly the same thing, except then, we got confirmation that the first two movies would be Venom and The Sinister Six. In a somewhat schizophrenic turn here, the initial story seemed to us like a “Fresh Development,” but we were less impressed by some of the creative people announced three weeks later, and so the second story was a borderline “Rotten Idea.” The real response here is… we don’t know.\n\n\n\t\nDECEMBER: PAUL RUDD CONFIRMED TO PLAY FOUNDING AVENGERS MEMBER ANT-MAN IN 2015\n\nThis year wasn’t the first time this was true, but 2013 was another year in which superhero movies dominated the headlines. And so, it’s not at all surprising that one third of these top stories involve DC and Marvel superheroes, wrapping up with one of the founders of The Avengers. The curious thing, however, is that Ant-Man has never really burst out into the public consciousness the way that teammates Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor have. Of course, the same was true of Black Widow and Hawkeye (who joined the Avengers in the comics much later than Ant-Man), but after their movie debuts, the opposite is now true. So, it’s exciting to learn that Paul Rudd was recently confirmed to have been cast by Marvel Studios to star as the shrinking superhero Ant-Man when the film is released in theaters on July 31, 2015. Sometime in 2014, we should know who will be playing his wife, Janet Van Dyne, AKA Wasp, the remaining founding member of the Avengers we haven’t yet seen in a live action movie.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Purge, deadpool, drama, Larson, Network","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Yearly-Ketchup-The-Freshest-Stories-of-2013"},{"id":"47509163340955","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Women Power \"Break-Up\" to #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Women Power \"Break-Up\" to #1by Gitesh Pandya | June 4, 2006 |  CommentsNosy moviegoers just couldn’t stay away from a high-profile lovers quarrel as the anti-romantic comedy The Break-Up starring Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston surprised the industry this weekend by opening at number one, shoving the comic book juggernaut X-Men: The Last Stand into second place in only its second weekend.The mutant sequel was widely expected to remain atop the North American charts. The only other new face in the top ten was the global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth which expanded and jumped into the number nine slot while still in limited release. Overall, the box office remained healthy with the top four choices gobbling up most of the business.Jen and Vince attracted millions of fans to theaters with The Break-Up which debuted with an estimated $38.1M over the weekend beating all expectations. Universal launched the date movie in 3,070 locations and averaged a stellar $12,395 giving the studio its best opening yet this year. It was also the third biggest debut ever for a romantic comedy trailing the $43.1M of Hitch and the $39.9M of 50 First Dates which both premiered just days before Valentine’s Day. Women fueled the business for Break-Up. Studio research showed that a whopping 67% of the audience was female while the crowd was evenly split between those over and under the age of 30. Vaughn and Aniston play a couple that breaks up, but still decides to live in the same condo together.Produced for $52M, The Break-Up sparked lots of media attention over the past year because of Aniston’s split from ex-husband Brad Pitt and her new relationship with Vaughn. Curiosity seemed to attract the former Friends star’s core audience of young women while men were far less interested. Universal’s marketing pushed the starpower and the lack of any other new wide releases kept the attention on Break-Up. Plus, the marketplace has not offered any star-driven films aimed at women in several weeks. Critics, however, gave little support with many panning the film finding it lacking in both romance and comedy. Aniston scored the second biggest opening of her career after 2003’s Bruce Almighty ($68M) while Vaughn enjoyed his third largest after 1997’s The Lost World ($72.1M) and last summer’s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith ($50.3M). The Break-Up, however, marks new career highs for each actor in a leading role.After a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend opener, X-Men: The Last Stand crumbled in its second weekend plunging 67% to second place with an estimated $34.4M. After ten days of release, the mutant sequel has hauled in a staggering $175.7M domestically. Most industry watchers had expected the super hero pic to remain at number one this weekend, but a stronger-than-expected opening by Break-Up coupled with a larger-than-expected decline for X-Men led to a second place finish. Given that loyal fans all rushed to the theaters on the debut frame and the added holiday boost, a steep drop was widely anticipated, but a drop of two-thirds was especially high. Subsequent weeks should stabilize a bit, but based on its trajectory, the third X-Men film looks to be headed to a domestic tally of $230-240M which would still make it the biggest hit of the trilogy.Holding steady in third place once again this weekend was the animated film Over the Hedge which slipped only 24% to an estimated $20.6M in its third outing. After 17 days, Paramount has collected an impressive $112.4M with the DreamWorks production. After three weeks of having the family market virtually to itself, Hedge will face some stiff competiton next weekend when Disney and Pixar race into theaters with Cars.Losing a reasonable 43% of its audience in its third weekend, The Da Vinci Code ranked fourth with an estimated $19.3M. That pushed the 17-day total to a stunning $172.7M making the religious thriller the year’s third biggest domestic hit behind Fox’s Ice Age and X-Men sequels. Overseas, Da Vinci continues to lead the box office for the third straight weekend delivering sizzling results. The Ron Howard-directed smash grossed an estimated $51M, down 44% from last weekend, boosting the international tally to a towering $409M. With a sensational $582M in global grosses (70% of which is from outside North America), The Da Vinci Code will shatter the $600M mark by the end of the week.The top four films ruled the weekend accounting for 88% of all money spent on the top ten films. All other players in the marketplace grossed under $5M each.Dropping only 33% and finishing fifth for the frame was the spy sequel Mission: Impossible III with an estimated $4.7M which pushed Paramount’s domestic cume to $122.7M. For the fourth consecutive weekend, the ocean liner disaster film Poseidon followed right behind Tom Cruise’s actioner and dropped 40% to an estimated $3.4M. Warner Bros. has taken in just $51.7M thus far.For the first time in five years, the month of May ended without any of its releases hitting the $200M mark. But while none of this year’s early summer contenders has come close to last year’s Star Wars Episode III which had amazingly smashed through the $300M mark at this point, collectively the hits have managed to measure up to 2005. The aggregate gross of the top five May films this year is $635M which is up 2% from this same point a year ago. Instead of flocking to one giant megahit, moviegoers have been spreading the same amount of money across a collection of popular films.Sony’s hit kidpic RV continued to hold up well slipping only 21% in its sixth weekend to an estimated $3.3M. The Robin Williams film has taken in $61.8M to date. Lionsgate witnessed a surprisingly strong hold for its horror entry See No Evil which dipped 26% and grossed an estimated $2M. Total stands at $12.4M.Proving that it is more than just a blue-state hit, Al Gore‘s global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth expanded into major markets and hit the top ten grossing an estimated $1.3M from only 77 theaters. The Paramount Vantage release averaged a stunning $17,299 over the weekend and raised its cume to $1.9M after bowing last week in just four theaters in New York and Los Angeles. This Friday, Truth widens to the Top 25 markets with about 150 total theaters before going national on June 16 in 450-600 locations.The PG-rated film has quickly nabbed the title of must-see summer doc this year and hopes to follow in the footsteps of last year’s March of the Penguins and 2004’s Fahrenheit 9/11 as non-fiction films that crossed over to become pop culture events. Those films rank as the top-grossing documentaries ever with $77.4M and $119.2M, respectively. This weekend, the former Vice President’s environmental pic became the first film of the year to enter the top ten while playing in fewer than 200 theaters.Rounding out the top ten was Lindsay Lohan‘s comedy Just My Luck with an estimated $825,000, down a steep 58%, for a cume to date of $15.6M.Break-Up and Inconvenient Truth bumped two spring films out of the top ten. Universal’s controversial 9/11 thriller United 93 dropped 43% to an estimated $464,000 after spending five weeks in the top ten. The $15M film has grossed $30.6M to date and should collect a bit more before ending its theatrical run. Fox’s animated sequel Ice Age: The Meltdown has spent eight of its ten weekends in the top ten and is now headed for the finish line grossing over $191M to date. The PG-rated hit remains the top-grossing film of 2006 thus far and has unearthed more than $625M worldwide.Opening this weekend in limited release was the Lionsgate sports drama Peaceful Warrior which took in an estimated $77,000 from ten sites for a solid $7,700 average. Also debuting, but with weaker results, was the Korean action film Typhoon with an estimated $48,000 from 24 theaters. The Paramount Vantage release attacked nine markets and averaged a dull $2,009.The top ten films grossed an estimated $127.9M which was up 2% from last year when Madagascar climbed into the number one spot with $28.1M; but down 30% from 2004 when Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban opened in the top slot with a June record $93.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Election, Walt, Nominations, Action, BBC, Starz, worst","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Women-Power-BreakUp-to-1"},{"id":"47509165487264","title":"Box Office Preview: Will People Show Up for \"Da Vinci Code\"?","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: Will People Show Up for \"Da Vinci Code\"?by Gitesh Pandya | May 18, 2006 |  CommentsWill North American moviegoers pay heed this weekend to negative reviews coming out of Cannes? That is the question on the minds of Sony brass, and industry watchers in general, on the eve of the much-anticipated global launch of \"The Da Vinci Code.\" The mega-hyped conspiracy thriller will not be the only new entry hitting theaters, though. DreamWorks goes after the family audience with its latest computer animated comedy \"Over the Hedge\" which debuts ultrawide while Lionsgate offers a more subdued opening for its new horror film \"See No Evil.\" After a weaker-than-expected start to the summer movie season, Hollywood is hoping for its highest-grossing weekend of the year to help kick things into gear.Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard reteam over a decade after \"Apollo 13\" for the controversial new film \"The Da Vinci Code,\" the big-screen adaptation of the best-selling novel by Dan Brown. The PG-13 film assembles a top-notch cast from both France and the United Kingdom including Audrey Tautou, Jean Reno, and Ian McKellen. An unprecedented global roll-out into a reported 11,000-plus screens overseas will ensure that the film generates one of the largest worldwide opening weekend grosses in history, no matter who is denouncing it. Much has been written about the subject matter of the book and the opposition that it sparked from Christian leaders around the world. Now, the issue shifts to the effects these feelings will have on the box office performance.Sony’s marketing team has been carefully planning every step of the campaign leaving nothing to chance. Its decision to withhold the standard early screenings for members of the press can be attributed to one of two reasons. Either they knew reviews would be bad so show it at the last moment, or they wanted to heighten anticipation and funnel it all right into the opening weekend. Or maybe it was a combination of the two. Regardless, the first wave of reviews hit this week following the screenings at the Cannes Film Festival and the majority of critics have been disappointed with some completely trashing the Mona Lisa pic. This should certainly have an impact on the grosses since as an adult-skewing film, \"Code\"’s customers are likely to listen to what reviewers have to say. Fans of the book and those caught up in the hoopla may not be affected much, but those on the fringes who have had a bit of curiosity may now wait until word-of-mouth kicks in. For so many big films in the past, critics and ordinary movie fans have been on two completely different pages.The starpower of Hanks is the anchor for \"Da Vinci\" and fellow Oscar winner Howard provides an added level of prestige to the picture. But the opposition to the film’s subject matter will play an important part of the opening weekend. Many religious groups have been urging people not to see the film. Some will stay away, but the media hype is only making others more curious to see what the fuss is all about. With the big premiere in France, there has been endless press coverage putting the spotlight on the film so awareness is very high. To Sony’s credit, the hype that it created has been better managed than what Paramount experienced with \"Mission: Impossible III\" a couple of weeks ago. Americans don’t seem to be sick of Hanks the way they were with Cruise who became overexposed.Competition will be somewhat of a factor as \"MI3\" and \"Poseidon,\" while both performing below expectations, will still be pulling in mature adult audiences this weekend and will combine for about $25M or so in ticket sales. \"Da Vinci\" does not have clear sailing. However, its audience is well-defined, energized, and looking at this as an event picture. Sony is hoping to tap into the curiosity factor and pull in those who have read the book in addition to those who have not who are more drawn in by the starpower and hype. Whether teens care to show up in large numbers this weekend, or wait a week and get their McKellen fix when he dons his Magneto helmet, could determine how high \"Da Vinci\" goes. Solving its mystery in 3,735 theaters in North America on Friday, \"The Da Vinci Code\" might open in the area of $60M this weekend.Crashing into theaters with zero controversy is the DreamWorks animated adventure \"Over the Hedge\" which will play to a family audience. The PG-rated film tells the story of a group of animals from the wilderness who cross into a foreign land — the backyards of suburbia. Bruce Willis, Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, William Shatner, Wanda Sykes, and Nick Nolte all lend their voices to the colorful pack of characters. The studio has been a driving force in the world of computer animation and has had hits outside of its \"Shrek\" franchise with 2004’s \"Shark Tale\" and last May’s \"Madagascar\" which both opened to three-day tallies of close to $48M a piece.Both ogre pics bowed on the weekend before the long Memorial Day frame so they can generate two blockbuster weekends to get things going. Last year, with \"Star Wars Episode III\" claiming the coveted spot already, the studio launched \"Madagascar\" during the holiday frame. This time, DreamWorks has reclaimed its favorite spot on the calendar and with parents not likely to want to take their young ones to see religious conspiracies, sinking ships, or gun-wielding spies, \"Over the Hedge\" will have smooth sailing with its target audience.But all will not be easy at the box office. For one thing, audiences have been bombarded by animated films with cute animals over the past six months. \"Chicken Little,\" \"Hoodwinked,\" \"Doogal,\" \"Curious George,\" \"The Wild,\" and of course the mammothly successful \"Ice Age\" sequel have been hitting up families with options and not all lived happily ever after. Also, \"Hedge\" lacks a major comic voice as an anchor to the picture. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Ray Romano, and even Will Smith have been instrumental in drawing crowds to their toons. In \"Hedge,\" Carell steals the show with his zany antics, but the supporting role does not allow the whole marketing campaign to be built around it. Plus, the tame storyline is good for young children, but is not hip enough to lure in large numbers of teens which is what you need to really see the grosses swell.Like with all of its big animated films, DreamWorks has backed \"Over the Hedge\" with a ton of marketing dollars to make it into a must-see for families. The lack of direct competition in the marketplace will be a crucial factor and with vacation time coming up, parents should be out looking for things to do with their kids over the next two weeks. And with some groups encouraging those who can’t resist \"Da Vinci\" to buy tickets for \"Hedge\" before walking into the Hanks pic’s auditorium, there could be some bonus bucks to pick up too. Busting into over 3,800 theaters, \"Over the Hedge\" might capture around $38M this weekend.Pro wrestler Kane jumps from the squared circle to the big screen in the new horror film \"See No Evil\" opening in moderate national release this Friday. The R-rated film hopes to draw in the millions of fans of World Wrestling Entertainment with the type of pic most enjoy watching. In \"Evil,\" Kane (or Glen Jacobs as his driver’s license says) plays a psycho killer who terrorizes a group of teen punks. Sure, not the most original idea for the genre. But distributor Lionsgate has a solid track record marketing successful fright flicks with plenty of gore. Older teens and young adults will make up the primary audience and a male skew is likely. \"Da Vinci\" will be cutting into all audiences so competition will be tough even though there are no formidable horror titles out there now.The marketplace has endured a long line of horror flicks this year and many recent ones have not worked out well indicating fans could be getting picky. Since the plot has nothing new to offer, \"Evil\" must sell itself on the untested starpower of Kane as there are no other commercial hooks here. Hardcore wrestling fans might make it out, but the real audience should find this one on DVD around back-to-school season. Opening in over 1,000 theaters, \"See No Evil\" might debut to around $4M.The arrival of \"The Da Vinci Code\" should make the marketplace’s two leading films nervous. Both \"Mission: Impossible III\" and \"Poseidon\" are playing to adult audiences looking for action and thrills and with the media spotlight fully pointed at Hanks and his buddies this week, direct competition will be intense. \"MI3\" has become the first film to top the charts over the first two weekends of May since 2003’s \"X2: X-Men United.\" With Da Vinci attacking, Tom Cruise can retire to his stay-at-home dad duties now as his latest spy sequel looks to tumble by 45% to about $13.5M. That would give Paramount $106M in 17 days for their expensive summer entry.The chance to see a mighty ocean liner capsize just wasn’t enough to lure in many movie fans last weekend for \"Poseidon.\" Word-of-mouth is nothing more than average and the Ron Howard thriller will hit the sinking ship flick where it hurts this weekend. A 50% drop would leave the disaster film with roughly $11M for the frame and a disappointing $39M in ten days for the $160M Warner Bros. release.LAST YEAR: George Lucas unleashed his final Jedi flick with \"Star Wars Episode III\" which dominated the box office debuting to a colossal $108.4M over three days and a towering $158.4M over the Thursday-to-Sunday opening period. Fox scored the second largest Friday-to-Sunday bow in history trailing the $114.8M of 2002’s \"Spider-Man\" which launched on a Friday. \"Episode III\" went on to gross $380.3M domestically and $849M worldwide becoming the top-grossing film of the year in North America and the second biggest global hit of 2005 after the last \"Harry Potter\" pic. Afraid of the Force, all other studios took a vacation by not opening anything against the Darth Vader film. Second place went to the chick flick comedy hit \"Monster-in-Law\" which grossed $14.4M in its second weekend while third place was taken by the Will Ferrell comedy \"Kicking and Screaming\" with $10.7M. Future Oscar champ \"Crash\" enjoyed the lowest decline in the top ten slipping 21% to $5.5M and the Jet Li actioner \"Unleashed\" rounded out the top five with $4.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"who, what, Box, cancelled, Pacific, Central, Comedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Will-People-Show-Up-for-Da-Vinci-Code"},{"id":"47509163333785","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Cars\" Parks Itself at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Cars\" Parks Itself at #1by Gitesh Pandya | June 11, 2006 |  CommentsThe Disney/Pixar animated film Cars raced past the competition to finish in first place at the North American box office. Though it did not open as strong as some of its predecessors, the toon easily outdistanced everything else in the current marketplace outselling the second place film by a three-to-one margin.Also debuting this weekend, the horror remake The Omen scared up a solid debut since its Tuesday launch and the Robert Altman film A Prairie Home Companion also posted healthy numbers in its opening. Overall, the box office remained stronger than last year’s thanks to an assortment of popular films offering something for everybody. Six films reached double-digit millions this weekend as the marketplace displayed great breadth in its product offering.Crossing the finish line with an estimated $62.8M in ticket sales, Cars easily topped the charts this weekend giving Disney and Pixar their seventh number one hit together. Playing at an ultrawide 3,985 theaters, the G-rated story of a cocky race car who learns that winning isn’t everything averaged a musclar $15,759 per site. The opening did, however, put an end to the decade-long streak that Pixar enjoyed where every film debuted bigger than the previous one. The company’s last entry The Incredibles bowed to $70.5M from 3,933 theaters for a $17,917 average in November 2004 while the previous smash Finding Nemo opened to $70.3M from 3,374 venues for a $20,821 average in May 2003.Cars did not reach the $70M mark that those two hits surpassed on opening weekend and instead performed just like Pixar’s Monsters, Inc. which launched with $62.6M in November 2001. However, the new automotive adventure enjoyed higher ticket prices and 748 more theaters yet still reached the same figure. Among all animated films, the Cars opening ranks fifth all-time behind Shrek 2 ($108M), The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, and Ice Age: The Meltdown which bowed to $68M this past March. Cars did generate the second largest June opening ever behind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban which exploded two years ago with $93.7M.One reason Cars did not surge higher may have been that the marketplace has suffered through a glut of computer animated films this year. Not long ago, the arrival of a digital toon was an event as it only happened once or twice a year. Nowadays with weaker entries like Doogal and The Wild hitting theaters, and more studios jumping into the game, the novelty has worn thin. Over the Hedge and Ice Age have been satisfying families over the past two months grossing a stellar $322M combined. Also not helping matters was the film’s lengthy 116-minute running time which is considerably longer than the typical 90-minute length that most young kids are used to sitting through.Directed by Pixar veteran John Lasseter (Toy Story, Toy Story 2), Cars features the voices of Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy. Disney pumped in lots of marketing to push its first major entry in the summer sweepstakes and hopes to keep audiences coming back for more with the July 7 release of its Pirates of the Caribbean sequel.With more and more school children starting their summer vacations every day, mid-week grosses should be strong in the weeks ahead for Cars. Reviews have been good so many fans may end up catching the film in the weeks ahead. The Incredibles went on to reach a final domestic haul of $261.4M which was almost four times its opening weekend. Nemo had even stronger legs finding its way to $339.7M, or about five times its debut. Given its start out of the gate, Cars still looks set to zoom well past the $200M mark in North America.Following its surprise top spot debut last weekend, the Vince Vaughn–Jennifer Aniston comedy The Break-Up dropped a sizable 48% in its sophomore frame and placed second with an estimated $20.5M. With an impressive $74.1M in only ten days, the Universal release looks to reach the neighborhood of $120M by the end of its domestic run. It was produced for $52M. Overseas, The Break-Up opened in Australia and New Zealand with a combined $2.2M from 230 locations, helped by local appearances by the film’s stars. It ranked number one in both countries on Thursday and Friday, but was bumped by Cars on Saturday and Sunday thanks to the Pixar flick’s strong matinee business with children. Most other major international markets will open after the World Cup.X-Men: The Last Stand dropped a hefty 54% in its third weekend and grossed an estimated $15.6M. The super hero hit upped its cume to $201.7M after 17 days and became the top-grossing film of 2006. Fox’s franchise flick is still on course to surpass the $214.9M of its predecessor to become the highest grossing X-Men installment.Opening right on the heels of the mutants was the studio’s remake of The Omen which took in an estimated $15.5M over the Friday-to-Sunday period. Fox launched the R-rated thriller with a much-hyped Tuesday debut on 6/6/06 grossing a stunning $12.6M in its first day. That made it the largest Tuesday gross ever for any film. The son-of-the-devil pic settled in to more normal grosses on subsequent days and collected a hefty $20.3M over the Tuesday-to-Thursday mid-week period giving The Omen a strong six-day opening tally of $35.7M. Reviews were not too favorable.Starring Julia Stiles, Liev Schreiber, and Mia Farrow, the new religious chiller played more to today’s younger horror audience than to the older fans who were spooked by the 1976 original. Studio research showed that 52% of the audience was female and a very high 63% was under the age of 25. Fox estimated that the production cost for the new Damien pic was in the mid-$20M range. The studio’s decision to open the film globally on the devilish date was central to the marketing campaign and made it an event film rather than yet another remake of a horror classic. But with sales eroding over the course of the week, The Omen could be in for some steep declines in the weeks ahead.The animated comedy Over the Hedge experienced its largest drop yet thanks to the arrival of Cars falling 50% to an estimated $10.3M. The Paramount release has collected a solid $130.3M thus far. Tied for fifth place, Sony’s religious thriller The Da Vinci Code dropped 45% to an estimated $10.3M pushing its domestic total to $189M.Opening in seventh place with respectable results was Robert Altman’s latest film A Prairie Home Companion with an estimated $4.7M from only 760 theaters. Averaging a solid $6,146 per location, the PG-13 film about the backstage drama behind a country music reunion show featured an all-star ensemble cast including Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline, Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, and Lindsay Lohan. Prairie, which earned mostly positive reviews, was released by Picturehouse and played to a mature adult audience.Paramount’s spy sequel Mission: Impossible III grossed an estimated $3M, down 35%, giving the Tom Cruise actioner $127.5M to date. Robin Williams saw his family comedy RV dip 38% to an estimated $2M in its seventh weekend giving Sony $65M. Rounding out the top ten was Poseidon with an estimated $1.8M, down 47%, for a $54.9M cume for Warner Bros.Although the summer season is lacking a $300M+ megahit like last year’s Star Wars Episode III, the most popular films are still pulling in the same amount of business. The collective gross of the top five summer films so far is $722.6M which is up 2.4% from this same point a year ago. However, it is still a far cry from the mammoth $907M that 2004’s five biggest summer hits grossed at this stage two years ago led by the Shrek and Harry Potter sequels.Three films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. Paramount Vantage’s global warming hit An Inconvenient Truth widened from 77 to 122 theaters and grossed an estimated $1.5M in its third frame. Though no longer in the top ten, it did still post a strong per-theater average of $12,077. The Al Gore film has taken in just under $4M from its limited release and will expand to about 400 runs nationwide this Friday.The Lionsgate horror entry See No Evil got hacked 58% to an estimated $860,000 for a cume of $14M. A $15M final seems likely. Lindsay Lohan‘s teen comedy Just My Luck tumbled by two-thirds to an estimated $295,000. The Fox title has grossed a disappointing $16.2M to date and should finish up with only a little more.Opening this weekend in limited release was the documentary The Heart of the Game which follows a girls high school basketball team and its coach. The Miramax title grossed an estimated $12,200 from just three theaters for a decent $4,068 average.The top ten films grossed an estimated $146.4M which was up 9% from last year when Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith debuted at number one with $50.3M; but off 3% from 2004 when Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban remained in the top spot with $34.9M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Freeform, Marvel, One, 72, TCA, target, Tyler, new, It, Kaling, Lionsgate","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Cars-Parks-Itself-at-1"},{"id":"47509165491361","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Mission: Impossible 3\" Beats \"Poseidon\" to Remain at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Mission: Impossible 3\" Beats \"Poseidon\" to Remain at #1by Gitesh Pandya | May 14, 2006 |  CommentsTom Cruise‘s spy sequel Mission: Impossible III remained the most popular film in North America for the second straight weekend while the big-budget disaster film Poseidon opened in second place to disappointing results.The frame’s other new releases, the Lindsay Lohan comedy Just My Luck and the soccer drama Goal! The Dream Begins, opened miserably as well giving the industry little to celebrate. Overall ticket sales fell behind those of the comparable weekend in each of the last four years as a sluggish marketplace waits for that one true summer blockbuster that draws the masses into the multiplexes.Despite a weaker-than-expected opening weekend, Paramount’s MI3 enjoyed a respectable sophomore frame dropping 49% to an estimated $24.5M to retain its standing as the number one film. Playing in an ultrawide 4,059 theaters, the Ethan Hunt actioner averaged a solid $6,039 per location and raised its ten-day total to $84.6M. The decline was very similar to the 48% second weekend fall for last summer’s big spy flick Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith which grossed $26M in its sophomore shot after a $50.3M bow. The Pitt-Jolie vehicle, however, captured a more muscular $96.7M in its first ten days thanks in part to a June release when more students were out of school.With so many action sequels tumbling by 55% or more on the second weekend, Mission: Impossible III managed to hold up relatively well. Competition from Poseidon was not formidable so moviegoers were not drawn away to another big event pic. The latest Ethan Hunt film will face its true test this Friday when the much-anticipated thriller The Da Vinci Code starring that other Tom opens followed a week later by the mutant juggernaut X-Men: The Last Stand. At its current pace, look for MI3 to reach $130-140M domestically making it the lowest grossing installment of the decade-old franchise. The first Mission: Impossible grossed $181M in 1996 while MI2 took in $215.4M in 2000. Overseas, MI3 jumped to $129.2M in foreign sales putting the worldwide tally at $213.8M in under two weeks. The global box office gross looks to be on a trajectory to hit $350M.Failing to sink Cruise’s ship, the ocean liner disaster pic Poseidon settled for the runner-up spot this weekend opening with an estimated $20.3M from 3,555 locations. Warner Bros. generated a decent but not impressive per-theater average of $5,717 with its first pricey entry of the summer movie season. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (The Perfect Storm, Air Force One), the PG-13 film was a remake of the 1972 picture The Poseidon Adventure and starred Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, and Richard Dreyfuss as passengers on a luxury ship who must fight to survive after a rogue wave capsizes the vessel. Poseidon opened weaker than other big-budget maritime action films like 2003’s Master and Commander ($25.1M), 2000’s The Perfect Storm ($41.3M), and even 1995’s infamous Waterworld ($21.2M).Although audiences in years past have flocked to May disaster films like Twister, Deep Impact, and The Day After Tomorrow, this time Poseidon lacked the goods to draw in a paying audience. Reviews were not kind which also made the adult-skewing picture a tough sell. Varying reports on the film’s budget put the production cost in excess of $160M so a stellar run internationally and on DVD will be needed in order to turn a profit. Poseidon set sail in a handful of Asian countries to the tune of $4.4M this weekend, but will open in most foreign territories in June and July.Once again scoring the best hold among all wide releases was the Robin Williams family comedy RV which dipped a mere 14% in its third weekend to an estimated $9.5M. The Sony hit has collected a solid $42.8M in 17 days.Ticket buyers ignored Lindsay Lohan’s new film Just My Luck which flopped in its opening weekend grossing a mere $5.5M, according to estimates. The Fox release averaged an unlucky $2,165 per location and played almost exclusively to a teen girl audience. Studio research showed that the crowd for Luck was a remarkably high 80% female and 70% under the age of 25. Critics, not surprisingly, panned the film.Horror flick An American Haunting enjoyed a solid sophomore session dropping only 36% to an estimated $3.7M for fifth place. Distributed by Freestyle Releasing, the PG-13 thriller has banked $10.9M in ten days and should scare its way to a mediocre $17-19M. Universal’s 9/11 thriller United 93 followed with an estimated $3.6M, down just 33%, lifting the cume to a decent $25.6M.The teen gymnastics pic Stick It dropped 41% to an estimated $3.2M to land in the number seven spot with a total to date of $22.2M for Buena Vista. Fox’s animated sequel Ice Age: The Meltdown, still the top-grossing film of 2006, grossed an estimated $3M sliding just 29% in its seventh weekend. No other film has spent as many weeks in the top ten this year. Cume stands at $187.4M domestically and over $600M worldwide.Sony’s fright pic Silent Hill placed ninth with an estimated $2.2M, off 45%, for a sum of $44.5M thus far. The New Line flop Hoot fell 37% to an estimated $2.1M in its second outing as the total inched up to a dismal $6.2M. Last weekend, the owl film had the distinction of suffering the worst opening in history for a film debuting in over 3,000 theaters. Hoot’s puny $3.4M bow in 3,018 sites beat out the dismal $6M launch from 3,006 theaters of 2004’s New York Minute starring the Olsen Twins for that unfortunate honor.Another film failing to connect with kids was Buena Vista’s new soccer drama Goal! The Dream Begins which kicked off its run with a weak estimate of only $2M. The PG-rated film failed to qualify for the top ten this weekend and averaged a poor $1,989 from 1,007 locations.Two April releases fell from the top ten this weekend. The spoof comedy Scary Movie 4 dropped 44% to an estimated $2.1M in its fifth frame. With $86.6M to date, The Weinstein Co. release looks to finish with roughly $90M which would not be far off from the $110M of its predecessor 2003’s Scary Movie 3. The Lionsgate family drama Akeelah and the Bee declined 41% to an estimated $2M in only its third turn. Cume sits at just $13.6M and should reach $16-18M.Opening in limited release this weekend, Miramax’s family reunion comedy Keeping Up with the Steins grossed an estimated $621,000 from 138 locations for a respectable $4,500 average. The PG-13 film stars Garry Marshall, Jeremy Piven, and Daryl Hannah. The Swaziland-set drama Wah-Wah debuted in 25 theaters and grossed an estimated $57,000 for a mild $2,270 average. Starring Gabriel Byrne, Miranda Richardson, and Emily Watson, the R-rated film is distributed by Roadside Attractions and Samuel Goldwyn Films.Among indie films expanding into more markets, Sony Classics grossed an estimated $1.2M from its comedy Art School Confidential after widening from 12 to 762 theaters across the country. That left the John Malkovich–Anjelica Huston starrer with a pitiful $1,593 average per venue as it failed to register with moviegoers on a national level. Cume is $1.4M. Fox Searchlight expanded its Indian drama Water from 36 to 62 locations and grossed an estimated $257,000 for a $4,138 average. Total sits at $593,000 with more markets opening on Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $77.7M which was down 15% from last year when Monster-in-Law opened at number one with $23.1M; and down 23% from 2004 when Troy debuted in the top spot with $46.9M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"cooking, fiction, 93rd, tv, BET, Watching, Amazon, The","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Mission-Impossible-3-Beats-Poseidon-to-Remain-at-1"},{"id":"47509164888223","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Da Vinci Code\" Second Largest Global Opening in B.O.

Historyby Gitesh Pandya | May 21, 2006 |  CommentsDespite worldwide protests and bad reviews, the heavily-hyped conspiracy thriller \"The Da Vinci Code\" attracted legions of fans into theaters this weekend generating the second largest global opening in box office history. The North American marketplace was on fire helped also by a solid launch for the animated film \"Over the Hedge.\" The two new releases combined for an eye-popping $114M in ticket sales over the weekend driving the box office to a new high for the year finally giving the film industry a feeling that the summer movie season has arrived. With \"Code\" and \"Hedge\" playing well to different audiences, most holdovers suffered steep declines.Sony faced numerous obstacles bringing \"The Da Vinci Code\" to the big screen but after all was said and done, the studio successfully launched its summer tentpole pic and captured an estimated $77M from North America beating out most expectations. Attacking 3,735 theaters, the PG-13 film averaged a scorching $20,616 per location. \"Code\" is the much-anticipated film adaptation of the best-selling book by Dan Brown which has become a pop culture phenomenon since its publication. Many religious groups have encouraged people to not see the film, but the publicity may instead have just sparked more curiosity, especially from those who have not read the book. It carried a $125M pricetag.Domestically, \"Code\" generated the thirteenth biggest Friday-to-Sunday opening ever and the second best bow for a non-franchise film after \"The Passion of the Christ\" which debuted to $83.8M following a Wednesday launch in February 2004. \"Code\" also marked new career-high openings for Hanks and director Ron Howard surpassing the $57.4M of \"Toy Story 2\" and the $55.1M of \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\" respectively. In fact, Howard’s last film \"Cinderella Man\" grossed less in its entire run than \"Code\" did in its first weekend punching up $61.6M last summer.Worldwide, \"The Da Vinci Code\" was launched with one of the most aggressive distribution strategies ever planned invading over 12,000 theaters overseas. As a result, the film tallied a staggering $147M internationally putting its worldwide opening at a jaw-dropping $224M. That marked the second largest worldwide launch in history after the $253M of \"Star Wars Episode III\" this same weekend one year ago. With more appeal outside of North America than the Jedi flick, \"Code\"’s overseas opening inched past \"Episode III\" to set a new international debut weekend record.Controversy surrounded the film during its development, shooting, and pre-release stages which in turn led to endless media coverage and speculation over whether or not moviegoers would stay away. \"Code\" made its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday, just ahead of its day-and-date global release, and was met by mostly harsh reviews from the world’s top movie critics. Since \"Da Vinci\" skews to a mature adult audience which pays attention to critics, it seemed that the opening could take a hit from the bad buzz. Instead, the Hanks flick opened on the high end of the most optimistic expectations.The road ahead will not be easy. The Memorial Day holiday weekend will certainly help give \"Da Vinci\" a solid second weekend. However, with so many fans of the book rushing theaters immediately to see the film, it may have already burned through much of its total audience. \"Code\" dipped 6% on Saturday from its opening Friday which is not too surprising given the upfront demand and media hysteria. But it does not necessarily indicate that the fan base is growing. Word-of-mouth will now be the main factor affecting future sales. The Yahoo Movies average grade from over 13,000 users is a not-so-impressive B-. Nevertheless, after \"Mission: Impossible III\" and \"Poseidon\" underwhelmed at the box office giving the summer season a sluggish start, \"The Da Vinci Code\" kicked things into high gear this weekend with true blockbuster numbers grossing more than the openings of both of those films combined.Opening in second place with solid results was Paramount’s release of the DreamWorks animated film \"Over the Hedge\" which collected an estimated $37.2M. Playing in a whopping 4,059 theaters, the PG-rated pic averaged a strong $9,172 per venue. An all-star cast featuring Bruce Willis, Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, Nick Nolte, Wanda Sykes, and William Shatner provided voices to the story of a group of animals who venture into the zany world of suburban backyards. The opening weekend did not match up to those of other recent computer animated talking animal flicks like \"Shark Tale\" ($47.6M), \"Madagascar\" ($47.2M), or \"Chicken Little\" ($40M). However, with the long Memorial Day holiday weekend coming up, \"Hedge\" looks to continue gathering up grosses with kids and parents getting extra time off from school and work. Only four animated films have ever bowed in more than 4,000 theaters and all have been from the DreamWorks camp, which is now part of the Paramount stable.After two weeks at number one, Tom Cruise’s \"Mission: Impossible III\" dropped down to third with an estimated $11M in its third weekend. Down a hefty 56%, the Paramount spy sequel crossed the $100M mark over the weekend with its cume climbing to $103.2M after 17 days. \"MI3\" is only the second such blockbuster film of 2006 following \"Ice Age: The Meltdown,\" however Hollywood’s other Tom will be joining the ranks by the end of the week. For box office titan Cruise, the latest Ethan Hunt film marks the actor’s fourteenth $100M+ domestic grosser. \"MI3\" also represents the studio’s first film to join the century club since Cruise’s last film \"War of the Worlds\" from last summer. Overseas, \"Mission III\" has upped its total to $163M pushing the global gross to $266M and counting.In its second weekend, \"Poseidon\" became a sinking ship film in more than one way. The ocean liner disaster pic sank a troubling 59% to an estimated $9.2M putting its ten-day catch at just $36.8M. That’s a rough start for a film with a production cost reported to be a hefty $160M or more. At its current pace, \"Poseidon\" looks to reach $55-60M domestically making it director Wolfgang Petersen‘s lowest grossing film in fifteen years.With a big new toon in the marketplace, the Robin Williams hit \"RV\" finally saw a sizable decline dropping 49% to an estimated $5.1M in its fourth frame. Sony’s family comedy has grossed a solid $50.4M to date.Wrestling superstar Kane anchored the new horror film \"See No Evil\" and was met with a mild sixth place opening with an estimated $4.4M. Playing in only 1,257 locations, the R-rated scarefest averaged a mediocre $3,461 per site.The Lindsay Lohan flop \"Just My Luck\" grossed an estimated $3.4M in its second weekend dropping 41%. With only $10.5M in ten days, the Fox release should stumble to an unlucky final of just $16-18M. The horror flick \"An American Haunting\" followed with an estimated $1.7M, off 53%, for a total of $13.6M.Universal’s 9/11 pic \"United 93\" fell 59% to an estimated $1.4M pushing its cume to $28.3M. Rounding out the top ten was the Lionsgate release \"Akeelah and the Bee\" with an estimated $1M, off 58%, for a $15.7M total.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. The year’s highest-grossing film \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" took a hit from the arrival of a rival digital toon and tumbled 71% to an estimated $915,000. Budgeted at $80M, the Fox smash has grossed $189.2M to date and is heading for a final gross of a little more than $190M. The first \"Ice Age\" banked $176.4M in 2002.Buena Vista’s gymnastics pic \"Stick It\" grossed an estimated $927,000 plunging 71% in its fourth frame. With $23.8M to date, the teen flick should finish with a better-than-expected $25M. New Line’s endangered owl film \"Hoot\" collapsed 85% in its third weekend and collected an estimated $350,000. Cume sits at a puny $7.3M and it will be a struggle to hit $8M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $151.4M which was off only 3% from last year when \"Star Wars Episode III\" opened at number one with a colossal $108.4M; and down 7% from 2004 when \"Shrek 2\" debuted in the top spot with a massive $108M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Stephen, TLC, adventure, DC, reviews, children's, YouTube","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Da-Vinci-Code-Second-Largest-Global-Opening-in-BO-History"},{"id":"47509167171759","title":"Fleabag Creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge Joins Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones 5, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Fleabag Creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge Joins Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones 5, and More Movie NewsSony signs a big deal with Netflix, Ancient Aliens and Marshmallow Peeps get the big screen treatment, and new roles for Helen Mirren, Olivia Colman, Maria Bakalova, and Letitia Wright.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 9, 2021 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Ancient Aliens, Indiana Jones 5, Peeps, and Saw X.This WEEK’S TOP STORYPHOEBE WALLER-BRIDGE JOINS HARRISON FORD IN NEXT INDIANA JONES(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)It appears that Phoebe Waller-Bridge may not be reprising her role as the star and writer of Amazon’s Fleabag beyond its first two seasons any time soon (or ever), but we will definitely see&nbsp;her in other high-profile projects. In addition to co-writing Daniel Craig’s last James Bond film, No Time to Die (and voicing L3-37 in Solo: A Star Wars Story), Waller-Bridge will co-star with Donald Glover in Amazon Studios’ upcoming reboot of Mr. + Mrs. Smith.&nbsp; This week, however, she landed what might be her highest profile project ever, as she will be joining Harrison Ford as what is apparently the female lead in the not-yet-titled fifth Indiana Jones (7/29/2022) movie. Although Steven Spielberg was at one point expected to direct, he will be shepherding the film&nbsp;as producer instead, with James Mangold (Logan, The Wolverine, Ford v Ferrari) directing the sequel instead. Harrison Ford will turn 80 years old on July 13, 2022, 16 days before the current release date for Indiana Jones 5. Lucasfilm has not yet revealed any details about the premise or setting of the movie, but based on Ford’s age, one could guess that it might sometime in the 1970s or even the 1980s. We also learned this week that composer John Williams will be returning to give the classic Indiana Jones theme an update. Finally, in related news, the project that Steven Spielberg will be working on this summer instead of directing Indiana Jones 5 will be his untitled drama based on his youth in Arizona, and the latest star Spielberg has cast is Paul Dano, who will be playing the fictionalized version of Spielberg’s father. Dano joins the already cast Michelle Williams as Spielberg’s mother and Seth Rogen as Spielberg’s favorite uncle.Other Top Headlines1. OLIVIA COLMAN TO CELEBRATE THE MOVIES IN EMPIRE OF LIGHT(Photo by Sophia Mutevelian/©Netflix)You would think, for as many movies there are about filmmaking, there would be more than just a few films that are actually about movie theaters (examples include The Majestic, Cinema Paradiso, Matinee, and partially, Inglourious Basterds). Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall) appears determined to increase that tally by one as he has written (in what will mark his first credit as a film’s screenwriter) and will direct a romantic drama called Empire of Light, set at a movie theater in England in the 1980s.&nbsp;Olivia Colman will star in Empire of Light in an unspecified role, and the Searchlight Pictures film will be shot by Mendes’ frequent cinematographer, Roger Deakins (Revolutionary Road, Blade Runner 2049, 1918), when filming starts on location later this fall.2. NETFLIX MAKES FIVE YEAR DEAL WITH SONY THAT INCLUDES MORBIUS AND UNCHARTED(Photo by Sony Pictures Entertainment)Over the last year or two, as big studios launched their own streaming services, just a few major distributors remain that didn’t follow suit (namely Sony, MGM, and Lionsgate), not counting pay TV providers like Starz (which is owned by Lionsgate, and with which Sony has had a deal since 2006). We now know why Sony never announced their own streaming service, as the studio has instead signed an exclusive five-year licensing deal with Netflix&nbsp;that&nbsp;will begin in 2022 and will include such upcoming Sony movies as Marvel’s Morbius, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2, and the video game adaptation Uncharted. This deal basically positions Netflix as the main streamer that will have Marvel movies other than Disney+, as Sony will continue to have their own slate of Marvel Comics adaptations (Marvel projects in development at Sony include Jackpot, Kraven the Hunter, Madame Web, Silk, and&nbsp;Spider-Woman). Other Sony franchises that are likely to have new films released as part of this five-year deal include Bad Boys, Ghostbusters, Goosebumps, and Jumanji. This comes just one week after Netflix acquired the Knives Out sequels in a massive $469 deal, which we learned this week included $100 million payouts to just three people: star Daniel Craig, director Rian Johnson,&nbsp;and producer Ram Bergman. Lionsgate, the distributor of Knives Out, did bid on the sequels but lost out to Netflix.3. AN&nbsp;ANCIENT ALIENS MOVIE IS IN DEVELOPMENT(Photo by Paul Butterfield/Getty Images)Even if you’ve never seen any episodes of the 16 (!) seasons of the documentary series Ancient Aliens, you may have seen memes featuring wild-haired ufologist Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, or perhaps the Viceland series&nbsp;Traveling the Stars: Action Bronson and Friends Watch Ancient Aliens. As the title suggests, Ancient Aliens explores theories that ancient civilizations were visited and influenced by aliens as a way to explain amazing achievements, as first popularized in the 1970s by Chariots of the Gods. Just last week, Godzilla vs. Kong (Certified Fresh at 75%) featured a setting with a mysteriously unexplained ancient temple, and now that film’s production company, Legendary Entertainment, is collaborating with the producers&nbsp;of Cobra Kai (Fresh at 93%) for a feature film based on Ancient Aliens. Luke Ryan, who served as executive producer on Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle, is now working on adapting Ancient Aliens as a “two-handed, globe-spanning adventure,” which sort of makes it sound a bit like National Treasure, but with the “Ancient Aliens guy.” No casting announcements have been made yet, but we’re imagining Nicolas Cage would be perfect for something like Ancient Aliens.4. HELEN MIRREN TO STAR AS ISRAELI PRIME MINSTER GOLDA MEIR(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Although there are still many large nations that have never had female presidents or prime ministers (you might be living in one right now), this was a distinction that Israel overcame as&nbsp;early as 1969, when Golda Meir&nbsp;became Israel’s fourth Prime Minster. Meir’s five years as Prime Minister included the Yom Kippur War of 1973, and now that period is going to be depicted in a biopic&nbsp;called Golda, starring Helen Mirren. Golda will be directed by Israeli filmmaker Guy Nattiv, who won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for Skin, working from a screenplay by screenwriter Michael Kuhn (Florence Foster Jenkins, The Duchess). Although described as a biopic, Golda will focus on how Meir led her nation during the Yom Kippur War despite “infighting from her all-male cabinet.” Barbra Streisand is also currently developing a TV series about Golda Meir&nbsp;starring Shira Haas (Unorthodox) in a more expansive story that includes her life as a young woman in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.5. BREAKOUT BORAT STAR MARIA BAKALOVA SEES BODIES, BODIES, BODIES(Photo by IngleDodd Media/Getty Images)It happens every year (although it’s a little later this year), as Academy Award nominees or winners start to see new deals come their way as a result of their elevated profile during “awards season.” Besides the most obvious factor of the COVID-19 pandemic, another difference this year is that one of the Academy Award-nominated movies is Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (Certified Fresh at 85%), for which Bulgaria’s Maria Bakalova is nominated. One might usually expect a new Academy Award nominee to sign up for something like a stuffy period film, but instead, Bakalova is attached to star in a slasher film for A24 (Midsommar) called Bodies, Bodies, Bodies. Bakalova’s other main co-star will be Amandla Stenberg (The Hate U Give), and Pete Davidson (Saturday Night Live, The King of Staten Island) and Myha’la Herrold are also in talks. No details have been revealed as of yet about the film’s premise (other than it’s a “secret stalker” that A24 has been putting together for several months now), and that it will be directed by Dutch filmmaker (Instinct, Fresh at 80%).6. LETITIA WRIGHT TO STAR AS HALF OF THE SILENT TWINS(Photo by Marvel Studios)Marvel Studios and director Ryan Coogler are expected to start filming the sequel Black Panther II in July, and one of the stars expected to return for a significant role is Letitia Wright, who played T’Challa’s sister Shuri in the first film. This week, we learned that one of the projects Wright recently filmed in Portland, Oregon before heading back to Wakanda is a fact-based drama called Silent Twins. Focus Features has picked up the worldwide rights to Silent Twins, which is based on the true stories of June and Jennifer Gibbons, who were identical twins who were part of the only black family in a small town in Wales. It’s being reported that the sisters will be played by Letitia Wright and Tamara Lawrence, which is a little confusing since Wright and Lawrence don’t really look like each other (unless, perhaps, they play the sisters at different ages?). The title Silent Twins refers to the fact that the two girls refused to talk to anyone else besides each other.7. NO KID(DING), NO PLAY(ING), HOUSE PARTY IS GETTING REBOOTED(Photo by ©New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)Not all 1990s stars remain as famous as others. For example, Will Smith is still pretty much an A-list star, but knowing who Christopher Reid and Christopher Martin were will probably score you&nbsp;some points at your local trivia night. Together, the two Christophers were known as the hip hop group Kid ‘n Play, and in addition to their musical career, they were also the stars of the first three House Party movies (House Party, Fresh at 93%; House Party 2, Rotten at 21%; House Party 3, Rotten at 0%). New Line Cinema and producer LeBron James have been quietly developing a House Party reboot for a few years now, and this week, the reboot got closer to filming as the two leads have been cast. The new House Party stars will be relative unknowns Jorge Lendeborg Jr. and Tosin Cole, and the director will be music video director Calmatic, who will be making his feature film directorial debut.&nbsp; Jorge Lendeborg Jr.’s highest profile role to date was probably as Hailee Steinfeld’s friend “Memo” in Bumblebee, and Tosin Cole is probably best known for playing the companion Ryan Sinclair on 22 episodes of Doctor Who from 2018 to 2021.8. SAW X ALREADY IN DEVELOPMENT(Photo by Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)More so than any other genre, horror franchises sometimes seem critic-proof when it comes to their ability to continue getting new sequels produced in perpetuity. For example, none of the Saw movies has ever scored a Tomatometer higher than the Rotten 49% for the very first Saw, and yet, next month’s Spiral: From the Book of Saw&nbsp;will be the ninth movie in the franchise. According to the film industry magazine Production Weekly, active development has begun on a mysterious project called Saw X, which, presumably, is exactly what it sounds like. There’s not really much else to go on right now, including whether it will be a continuation of the characters introduced in Spiral: From the Book of Saw, which include roles played by Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson.9. CAN 700 MILLION PEEPS FANS BE WRONG?(Photo by William Thomas Cain/Getty Images)The bird-shaped marshmallow candy brand Peeps is obviously popular, based just on the claim that Peeps Incorporated sells over 700 million Peeps each year (admittedly&nbsp;a lot less than the number they make, which is reportedly over 2 billion). Having said that, Peeps is not inherently a narrative brand, since they’re&nbsp;literally just birds in bright neon-colored marshmallow form, but that also didn’t stop the Trolls dolls from getting their own animated movie (and a sequel and a spinoff series). And so, yes, Peeps is now in development as an animated movie to be produced by the team that gave us The Mauritanian (Fresh at 73%), which recently won Jodie Foster a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. A representative for Just Born, the company behind Peeps, had this to say: “Peeps Chicks and Bunnies have been ingrained in American pop culture for nearly seven decades due to their instantly recognizable shapes and fan-favorite marshmallow taste, making them the perfect characters to bring to life on the big screen.”On an Apple device?

Two much smaller films will attempt to offer some counter-programming for those moviegoers not in the mood for globetrotting action. New Line unleashes the kid drama Hoot while Freestyle Releasing debuts its horror flick An American Haunting. Neither is expected to put a dent into the MI3 machine which looks to lead the industry to its best summer kickoff in three years.After a six-year break, IMF Agent Ethan Hunt returns to the world of espionage in Mission: Impossible III anchored by Hollywood’s most bulletproof star. Director J.J. Abrams, best known to audiences as the creator of the hit ABC programs Lost and Alias, takes the helm of the latest PG-13 installment. A full decade after the franchise first launched, Tom Cruise returns to one of his most lucrative business ventures as a secret agent forced to reteam with fellow spies to stop a maniacal arms dealer played by recent Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman. Ving Rhames is back for his third mission and is joined by Billy Crudup, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Keri Russell, and Laurence Fishburne.As to be expected, MI3 packs all the action-packed thrills, death-defying stunts, and chilling suspense that fans are looking for both from the spy series as well as from their early summer popcorn flicks. Cruise flashes his billion-dollar smile every 2.3 seconds in the film and moviegoers get to see their hero play the \"dedicated husband\" role this time. The big box office question is whether Suri’s dad has lost any fans over the past year because of his strange behavior on talk shows, wacky public appearances with Katie Holmes, and dedication to Scientology. Is he still popular? Who else on the planet has grossed $4 billion dollars worldwide over the last 14 years with his films?Odds are he has indeed turned off some paying customers who showed up in years past for Mission: Impossible films, but will now choose to sit this one out. However, the overall audience for this giant is so immense that it will only make a small dent. Plus Paramount wisely staked out the first weekend of May ages ago for their prized property as the studio knew the film would need all the help it could get in order to guarantee blockbuster status. With no real competition in the marketplace, MI3 will monopolize the attention of both audiences and the media. Plus, megaplexes typically have more available screens at this time of year so the spy sequel can gobble up a fifth or sixth screen. In June and July, when so many big movies are crowded into theaters, the biggest hits are lucky to secure three or four screens within a venue. MI3 should have no problem soaking up all the consumer demand there is this weekend.Over the last two years, the first weekend in May turned out to be rather disappointing. After 2001’s The Mummy Returns ($68.1M debut), 2002’s Spider-Man ($114.8M), and 2003’s X2: X-Men United ($85.6M), Universal’s monster movie Van Helsing kicked off summer on the frame but its $51.7M bow seemed rather subdued compared to what the industry had seen in the past. Last year was even worse with the Crusades epic Kingdom of Heaven slumping to a $19.6M debut. This year, Hollywood kicks off summer with a crowdpleaser that is as mainstream and as commercial as it gets. MI3 may not have a crazed fan base like comic book pictures have, but it certainly should fly higher than the openings of other A-list spy flicks. The last James Bond film Die Another Day opened to $47.1M in 2002 while 2004’s The Bourne Supremacy took off with $52.5M. Cruise provides more starpower and the Mission series is arguably a bigger box office draw so the turnout this weekend should definitely top these figures.Comparing the new film to the previous two makes little sense in terms of box office grosses. Both of those opened mid-week ahead of a four-day Memorial Day holiday frame plus had other big blockbusters in the marketplace to deal with. Still, Mission: Impossible’s $56.8M four-day bow and MI2’s $70.8M holiday launch proved that moviegoers looking for some bang for the buck at the beginning of summer looked to Cruise for their thrills. Once again all the bases have been covered with Mr. You Complete Me hopping around the world over the past week attending premieres, dominating all press attention, and hyping up his film to ensure that ticket buyers come out to see this on the big screen. Plus Hoffman, fresh from his Academy Award win, adds value and credibility to the project as audiences prefer known actors in the role of the villain rather than some nobody whose acting fees happen to fit the budget.Paramount is sparing no expense in marketing Mission: Impossible III which should come as no surprise. As a studio, Paramount has only seen two films open to more than $50M over three days and both were Cruise vehicles – last year’s War of the Worlds with $64.9M and 2000’s MI2 with $57.8M. Their number one commodity has been out courting every demographic that has disposable income in hopes of appealing to a broad audience. Exciting teens and young adults is especially important as this heavy-spending group needs to be sold on the fact that the 43-year-old Cruise can still be a \"hottie.\" The requisite MTV appearances should do the trick. Older adults pay attention to critics and the film has scored high marks in that department so far.This weekend, all eyes are on MI3 to energize the marketplace and the fireworks begin early with many theaters starting their first showtimes at 10:00pm on Thursday night. A colossal theater count that is the second largest in history for any live-action film (after Spider-Man 2‘s 4,152) will make sure the product is available around every corner. Breaking into a mammoth 4,054 theaters in North America, the action thriller might open with around $74M over the Friday-to-Sunday span.Those looking for a few less bullets and explosions this weekend will have the chance to spend some time with a group of good-hearted kids trying to save endangered owls in the family drama Hoot. Based on the best-selling book, the PG-rated film is aimed at kids under the age of 14 as well as their parents. Fans of the book may certainly come out in force this weekend although some may be deterred by the lukewarm reception that critics are giving it. With Luke Wilson as its big name, Hoot has virtually no starpower to tap into and so will have to rely on the built-in audience in order to make an impressive showing. The Robin Williams film RV will provide ample competition for families and Stick It will steal away young girls leaving young boys as the likely audience. New Line’s marketing has not been too fierce so there is only so much box office potential. Hoot flies into more than 2,800 theaters on Friday and could debut with about $9M.Trying to carve out its own piece of the pie this weekend is the supernatural thriller An American Haunting which recently plopped itself onto the May 5 date. The PG-13 film stars Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek as nineteenth century landowners whose daughter becomes possessed. Distributor Freestyle Releasing is hoping to tap into the Exorcism of Emily Rose crowd with its spooky premise and tame rating making it accessible to young teens. However, Haunting should scare up a fraction of the business as much of its target audience will be busy lining up for MI3. A different release date would have been smarter. The marketing behind Haunting makes it look like the run-of-the-mill creepfest and after a long line of successful horror hits this year, audiences are demanding more. An American Haunting bows in 1,667 houses on Friday and may take in around $5M.Opening in limited release this weekend is the epic fantasy adventure The Promise which unites top actors from China, Korea, and Japan. Written and directed by Chen Kaige (Farewell, My Concubine), the PG-13 film was nominated for a Golden Globe in the foreign language category and was China’s official entry into this year’s Academy Awards. It was set to be released by The Weinstein Co. with the title Master of Crimson Armor, but the distribution deal fell apart at the beginning of this year. Warner Independent Pictures will now release The Promise charging into an aggressive 209 theaters in its first weekend.With all eyes on Ethan Hunt this weekend, holdover pictures will all take a backseat and see their grosses erode. But if history is any indicator, the declines may not be too steep. In both 2002 and 2003, when the first weekend of May saw colossal openings from Spider-Man and X2 respectively, most major holdovers experienced drops that were only in the 40-45% range. Studios are hoping that MI3 will bring in more traffic to the theaters and that there will be extra dollars to go around.Last weekend’s top film RV will not see too much competition from the spy sequel, but instead has Hoot taking away some of its family audience. A 40% drop to around $10M would give Sony’s Robin Williams pic $30M in ten days. Universal’s 9/11 thriller United 93 has generated solid reviews, scored very high in its exit polls, and generated a strong per-theater average last weekend. Second weekend sales should remain respectable. A 35% decline would give United 93 about $7.5M for the frame and a ten-day tally of $22M. Buena Vista’s gymnastics comedy Stick It might tumble 40% to around $6.5M for a cume of $19M after ten days.LAST YEAR The first weekend of May saw its worst opening in seven years as Ridley Scott’s big-budget epic Kingdom of Heaven debuted to just $19.6M. The Fox release went on to capture a disappointing $47.4M domestically, but more than tripled that amount overseas leading to a $211M worldwide tally. Opening in second with not-so-scary results was the horror remake House of Wax which bowed to $12.1M for Warner Bros. The fright flick melted quickly reaching a final total of $32.1M. Falling from first to third was the sci-fi comedy The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy which dropped 54% to $9.8M in its second voyage. Lions Gate didn’t make much noise opening its little movie called Crash which premiered in fourth with $9.1M. Although the race relations drama generated the smallest opening among the weekend’s three new films, it enjoyed the best legs and eventually became the highest overall domestic grosser with $53.4M. Rounding out the top five was the former Mrs. Cruise’s political thriller The Interpreter which took in $7.8M in its third mission.Author: Gitesh Pandya, BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Us","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Forecast-Mission-Impossible-III-Ignites-Blockbuster-Season"},{"id":"47509167151270","title":"Jurassic World: Dominion To Launch Preview in Front of F9 IMAX Screenings, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jurassic World: Dominion To Launch Preview in Front of F9 IMAX Screenings, and More Movie NewsThe Quiet Place spinoff gets a date, Cruella gets a sequel, Bernie Mac gets a biopic, and Rob Zombie gets The Munsters.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 11, 2021 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Cruella 2, The Munsters, the third Quiet Place, and a Bernie Mac biopic.This WEEK’S TOP STORYFIRST GLIMPSES AT JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION REVEALED(Photo by ©Universal courtesy Everett Collection)Universal Pictures&nbsp;had originally planned to release&nbsp;Jurassic World: Dominon this week, but the pandemic pushed the whole project back a year to June 10, 2022 instead. Universal is using that extra year to get fans and press alike excited about the dinosaur sequel, which this week included a press event in which an extended preview was revealed that will play exclusively before every IMAX screening of F9 when it’s released in two weeks on June 25, 2021. The preview starts with basically an “origin story” for one of the most iconic Jurassic Park dinosaurs (or rather, a dinosaur clone), and also shows off three new dinosaurs never before seen in a Jurassic Park or Jurassic World film. In the meantime, you can also see the first Jurassic World: Dominion poster right here, which basically shows where the DNA for one of the dinosaurs actually came from (though we already know this from Jurassic Park). Jurasic world: Dominion promises a huge ensemble cast made up not just of returning&nbsp;Jurassic World&nbsp;cast like Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, but also the three original Jurassic Park stars Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Sam Neill.Other Top Headlines1. A QUIET PLACE SPINOFF TO RAISE A RUCKUS IN 2023(Photo by Paramount Pictures)The COVID-19 pandemic held some movies back just a few months, while others, like Black Widow, F9, and No Time to Die were delayed over a year. Another was the science fiction thriller sequel A Quiet Place Part II (Certified Fresh at 91%), which in the original plan would have&nbsp;debuted just two years after the first film. As it turns out, that shorter gap between films will come between A Quiet Place Part II and a third film, which is being described more as a spinoff than a direct sequel. The Quiet Place spinoff will be directed by Jeff Nichols, whose films to date have been a combination of both indie-flavored drama (Loving, Mud) and indie-flavored science fiction (Take Shelter, Midnight Special), with the argument to be made that Nichols’ films may have had some influence on A Quiet Place. Nichols and Paramount aren’t revealing what the&nbsp;spinoff will entail, exactly, but it’s already scheduled for March 31, 2023. In related news, Jeff Nichols is also developing a separate science fiction project for Paramount Pictures, though we don’t know much of anything about it yet.2. CRUELLA SEQUEL ALREADY IN DEVELOPMENT(Photo by Laurie Sparham/©Disney+)It was just a week ago that the live action 101 Dalmatians prequel Cruella (Fresh at 74%) debuted on Disney+ and in theaters, but Walt Disney Pictures has already revealed that the studio has&nbsp;begun development on a sequel, with Emma Stone expected to reprise her role. This sequel will effectively be the sixth feature film in Disney’s 101 Dalmatians franchise, following the original animated 1961 film, its 2003 sequel, two live action Glenn Close movies, and Cruella. Craig Gillepsie, who directed Cruella, and screenwriter Tony McNamara are both also expected to return. It’s also not yet known (for sure) if the Cruella sequel will directly reprise any of the story beats from any of those first four films.3. PENNYWISE FROM IT JOINS JOHN&nbsp; WICK: CHAPTER 4(Photo by JA/Everett Collection)Lionsgate is in the midst of a casting spree for their ambitious action sequel John Wick: Chapter 4 (5/27/2022), which started two weeks ago with the casting of pop star Rina Sawayama, and continued last week with the casting of Donnie Yen. The&nbsp;latter might have seemed not that out of left field (given Donnie Yen’s action pedigree), but this week’s news about Bill Skarsgård, aka Pennywise the Clown from the recent IT movies, might be a bit more unexpected. Shamier Anderson (Netflix’s Stowaway) also joined John Wick: Chapter 4 this week, and Laurence Fishburne also confirmed that he will reprising his role as the Bowery King from John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (Certified Fresh at 89%). Fishburne isn’t expected to return as Morpheus in The Matrix 4 (12/22/2021), but Warner Bros this week sort of “stealth announced” that Christina Ricci has been cast as… we don’t know.4. JULIANNE MOORE TO STAR IN FIFTH FILM FOR DIRECTOR TODD HAYNES(Photo by ©Universal Pictures)Successful film directors&nbsp;tend to collaborate with the same actors frequently, and for Todd Haynes, that performer has most often been Julianne Moore, who starred or co-starred in Safe (Certified Fresh at 87%), Far from Heaven (Certified Fresh at 87%), I’m Not There&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 77%), and Wonderstruck (Fresh at 68%). Moore and Haynes will soon team up for their fifth film, as Moore is now signed to co-star in a drama called May December&nbsp;with Natalie Portman. May December is described as being about a woman (Moore) “who 20 years earlier had a notorious tabloid romance with a man who was 23 years younger than her” who is approached by a Hollywood actress (Portman) who is about to portray her in a movie.5. CAREY MULLIGAN TO PORTRAY #METOO-ERA INVESTIGATOR(Photo by ©Focus Features)Even as it was actively happening, many people were quickly able to figure out that the Harvey Weinstein #MeToo revelations of 2018 were inevitably going to be the subject of at least one feature film. There are, no doubt, other projects in development, but it appears that the first project out in production will be a drama called She Said, about the New York Times journalists Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor who first broke the earliest stories about allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein. Universal Pictures is developing She Said, and this week the studio hired Carey Mulligan (Promising Young Woman) and Zoe Kazan (The Big Sick) to star as Twohey and Kantor, respectively.6. SAOIRSE RONAN AND LAKEITH STANFIELD TO STAR IN SCI-FI THRILLER FOE(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)Perhaps it’s her accent, but Saoirse Ronan has, to date, more often than not starred in “period piece” films like Brooklyn, On Chesil Beach, Mary Queen of Scots, Little Women, and Ammonite (heck, even Lady Bird was technically a period piece). That will soon change as Ronan is now signed, along with LaKeith Stanfield and Paul Mescal, to star in a sci-fi thriller called Foe for director Garth Davis (Lion, Certified Fresh at 84%). Ronan and Mescal will play a young rural married couple who find their lives upended when a stranger appears at their farm telling them that the husband is headed to a life aboard an orbiting space station.7. JOHN LEGEND PRODUCING BIOPIC ABOUT COMEDIAN BERNIE MAC(Photo by ©Paramount/courtesy Everett Collection)It can sometimes take comedians decades to work their way up to fame (famous examples of this include Phyllis Diller, Larry David, and Ricky Gervais). This also happened to the late Bernie Mac, who didn’t star in The Original Kings of Comedy (Certified Fresh at 83%) until he was 42, and who died just eight years later at the age of 50 following years of struggling with sarcoidosis.&nbsp; This week, during a Tribeca Film Festival panel, John Legend’s producing partner revealed that Legend’s Get Lifted production company is now partnering with Bernie Mac’s estate to develop a biopic about his life. Legend and partner Mike Jackson did not reveal any details about who might be writing, directing, or starring in their Bernie Mac biopic.8. KEVIN HART TO VOICE ACE THE BAT-HOUND IN DC LEAGUE OF SUPER-PETS(Photo by Warner Bros.)Just two weeks ago, the news broke that Dwayne Johnson will be voicing the lead character of Krypto the Super-Dog in Warner Bros.’ animated DC League of Super-Pets (5/20/2022). This week,&nbsp;the studio revealed several more DC League of Super-Pets voice actors, although only Kevin Hart’s role as Batman’s sidekick Ace the Bat-Hound was specified. Other characters-yet-to-be-revealed will be voiced by Keanu Reeves, John Krasinski (A Quiet Place), Diego Luna (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), Natasha Lyonne (American Pie), and Saturday Night Live stars Vanessa Bayer and Kate McKinnon. In the comics, other members of the Legion of Super-Pets include Detective Chimp, Beppo the Super-Monkey, Comet the Super-Horse, and Streaky the Super-Cat, to give readers an idea of who else might show up. In related news, it now sounds like the Blue Beetle movie will now premiere exclusively on HBO Max. Director James Wan also revealed this week&nbsp;that his upcoming Aquaman sequel will be titled Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (12/16/2022).9. ROB ZOMBIE RESURRECTING THE MUNSTERS(Photo by MCA Television Entertainment courtesy Everett Collection)Ever since The Addams Family (Fresh at 100%) and The Munsters (Fresh at 83%) both debuted as live-action TV shows within 8 days of each other (in September, 1964), the two spooky families have been intertwined in pop culture memory. It’s perhaps human nature to want to say one show is a copy of the other, but the evidence appears to suggest that the timing and similar concepts were mostly coincidental. With The Addams Family (Rotten at 45%) returning in 2019 as an animated feature, with a sequel coming out this October, it’s perhaps natural then that The Munsters also are getting revived as a feature film. This revival is in development at Universal Pictures, which is also an obvious studio home, as The Munsters characters are closely inspired by classic Universal monsters like Dracula (Grampa) and Frankenstein (Herman Munster). Rocker-turned-horror-director Rob Zombie (House of 1,000 Corpses, Halloween) took to Instagram to announce that he will be directing The Munsters, saying, “Attention Boils and Ghouls! The rumors are true! My next film project will be the one I’ve been chasing for 20 years! THE MUNSTERS!” (His post was also littered with skulls and bats, because, you know, horror.)On an Apple device?

The project was announced this week&nbsp;during the Cannes (virtual) market, with Farrell and Weisz attached to star in Love Child, a dark comedy from director Todd Solondz (Happiness, Wiener Dog, Welcome to the Dollhouse), who describes it as “my first movie with a plot and my first movie taking place in Texas.” That plot is described as “a ‘dark and hilarious twist’ on the classic Oedipus story, with a precocious kid who schemes to rid himself of his brutish dad so he can have his mom all to himself. But things go awry when a handsome stranger appears.” Weisz will presumably play the Mom, but it’s unclear whether Colin Farrell will play the dad or the “handsome stranger” (or, since this is a Solondz movie, maybe he’ll play both?).Other Top Headlines1. CYNTHIA ERIVO TO REMAKE BETTE MIDLER’S THE ROSE(Photo by Eli Winston/Everett Collection)Hollywood has been trying to make a proper Janis Joplin biopic since the 1970s (and the legal struggles were such that 30 Rock spoofed it the “Jackie Jormp-Jomp” episode). In 1979, one such Joplin project was fictionalized and retitled as The Rose (Fresh at 78%) instead of The Pearl, with Bette Midler starring as a beloved singer struggling with substance addiction. Cynthia Erivo is now set to star in a remake of The Rose for Searchlight Pictures, although there is currently no director or writer. Erivo began her career on Broadway before expanding to film in movies like Widows, Bad Times at the El Royale, and as Harriet Tubman in Harriet. It’s worth noting that she has won an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony Award (all for The Color Purple), which means that she’s only an Academy Award win away from earning EGOT status. Cynthia Erivo is currently starring as Aretha Franklin in National Geographic’s Genius: Aretha (not to be confused with Jennifer Hudson’s upcoming Respect), and she will also co-star as the Blue Fairy in Pinocchio on Disney+ in 2022.2. KRISTEN WIIG TO STAR IN STEPFORD WIVES-ESQUE THRILLER THE HUSBANDS(Photo by Wilson Webb/20th Century Fox)We’ll never really be able to know how much better some films that were released during the COVID-19 pandemic might have done at the box office otherwise. One of those films, which opted for a streaming release in February, was the vacation comedy Barb &amp; Star Go to Vista Del Mar (Certified Fresh at 79%), starring Kristen Wiig and her Bridesmaids (Certified Fresh at 90%) screenwriting partner Annie Mumolo. MGM is now partnering with Brad Pitt’s Plan B production company on an adaptation of the novel The Husbands by author Chandler Baker, who will also adapt the screenplay from her own novel., and Wiig is signed on to star. Described as a Stepford Wives-esque thriller, The Husbands&nbsp;centers on “an overworked mother who, while house-hunting in a nice suburban neighborhood, meets a group of high-powered women with enviably supportive husbands” (and presuming the comparison to The Stepford Wives is accurate, you can probably guess where The Husbands goes from there).3. PAUL GIAMATTI TO REUNITE WITH SIDEWAYS DIRECTOR&nbsp;ALEXANDER PAYNE&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE HOLDOVERS(Photo by Jeff Neumann/©Showtime)In 2004, director Alexander Payne had just directed three films (Citizen Ruth, Election, About Schmidt), but his fourth,&nbsp;Sideways,&nbsp;a seemingly unambitious buddy comedy about two wine enthusiasts, ended up being something of an arthouse blockbuster, earning over $100 million, five Academy Award nominations, and an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. The stars of Sideways were Thomas Haden Church and Paul Giamatti, and now, Giamatti is set to reunite with Payne on another indie-flavored comedy called The Holdovers. Giamatti will play a “universally disliked teacher” at a prep school during Christmas, 1970, as he has to watch over the “holdovers,” who are students unable to go home. Filming of The Holdovers is scheduled to start in early 2022 on location in New England.4. DR. DRE PRODUCING MARVIN GAYE BIOPIC WHAT’S GOING ON(Photo by Everett Collection)Musical biopics are all the rage,&nbsp;particularly with the&nbsp;box office success, critical and audience acclaim, and awards attention of several recent films; the most recent Oscars ceremony alone recognized&nbsp;Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 98%), The United States vs Billie Holliday, and (partly) One Night in Miami (Certified Fresh at 98%). So it shouldn’t surprise anyone — particularly readers of this column — that new&nbsp;ones are announced with great regularity, and the big new project his week involves 1960s and 1970s soul and R&amp;B star Marvin Gaye, whose story will be told in What’s Going On, which takes its title from one of Gaye’s most famous songs (and albums). What’s Going On will be produced by Dr. Dre, Jimmy Iovine, and Andrew Lazar, and directed by Allen Hughes (Menace II Society, Dead Presidents, The Book of Eli). The budget of What’s Going On will reportedly be the “biggest ever for an African American music biopic, north of $80 million,” and it’s expected to be released sometime in 2023. In related news, the long-in-development disco-era Spinning Gold, about Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart (to be played by his son) is finally moving forward, with a supporting cast that includes Wiz Khalifa as George Clinton, Tayla Parx as Donna Summer, and Ledisi as Gladys Knight. Lastly, another musical biopic starting to cast up is I Wanna Dance with Somebody, starring Naomi Ackie as Whitney Houston, with Moses Ingram (of the upcoming&nbsp;Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi) as Houston’s longtime friend and assistant Robyn Crawford.5. EWAN MCGREGOR TO CLIMB EVEREST IN GEORGE MALLORY BIOPIC(Photo by Neil Davidson/IFC Films courtesy Everett Collection)Sometimes movies with similar premises or settings are released within a few years of each other. The 2015 action thriller Everest (Fresh at 73%), for example, was set on Mount Everest, but it was not about any of the famously historical attempts to first climb the mountain. That will be the premise of another movie called Everest, in which Ewan McGregor will star as English mountaineer George Mallory, along with Mark Strong as Arthur Hinks and Sam Heughan as George Finch. Jeffrey Archer’s novel Paths of Glory (not to be confused with the Stanley Kubrick film) is described as inspiring Everest. Director Doug Liman (Edge of Tomorrow, The Bourne Identity) will direct Everest from a screenplay by Sheldon Turner (Up in the Air) when filming starts in the UK and Italy in January, 2022.6. ICE CUBE TO SAY OH HELL NO TO HIS MOM DATING JACK BLACK(Photo by Scott Garfield/©Columbia Pictures, Deana Newcomb/©Millennium Entertainment)Sometimes, we pretty much give you the entire story in the headline, and there it is. Jack Black is now in negotiations with Sony Pictures to star in the quickly-coming-together comedy Oh Hell No, starring Ice Cube and to be directed by Kitao Sakurai, who is fresh off the release of his COVID-delayed comedy Bad Trip (Certified Fresh at 76%). Ice Cube will play a man who becomes very upset when he discovers that his mom is dating Jack Black’s character. Sony Pictures has scheduled Oh Hell No for release on June 17, 2022, which currently puts it up against Pixar and Disney’s Lightyear origin story for their Toy Story character Buzz Lightyear, to be voiced by Chris Evans.7. SIX DEGREES OF THE TOXIC AVENGER: KEVIN BACON CAST AS THE REBOOT’S VILLAIN(Photo by RCF/Everett Collection)Producer&nbsp;Lloyd Kaufman’s ultra-low-budget production company&nbsp;Troma Entertainment has given us such schlocky titles as Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D., Tromeo &amp; Juliet, The Class of Nuke ‘Em High (and its four sequels), and most infamously, The Toxic Avenger (and its three sequels). Big-time Hollywood production company Legendary Entertainment gives us super-expensive movies like Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, the Jurassic World&nbsp;franchise, and recently, Godzilla vs Kong. Surely, there is no project that could ever connect the two, right? That notion went out the window&nbsp;when Legendary decided to reboot&nbsp;Troma’s The Toxic Avenger, with Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage taking over as the toxic waste-powered superhero. We also now know that the “slick” villain of The Toxic Avenger will be played by Kevin Bacon. Elijah Wood also signed onto the film&nbsp;this week, as did prolific character actor Jonny Coyne, joining a growing ensemble that&nbsp; includes Jacob Tremblay (as Toxie’s son), Taylour Paige, Julia Davis, and Sarah Niles.8. ONCE UPON A TIME… IN HOLLYWOOD CHILD STAR JOINS SPIELBERG’S NEXT(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Julia Butters was just 9 years old when she co-starred in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood (Certified Fresh at 85%) as the young actress who gave Leonardo DiCaprio some much needed advice, and she’s currently 12 years old. It’s&nbsp;a reminder of how quickly time passes, particularly for child actors, and what a brief window&nbsp;some of them have for certain types of roles before they age out of them (consider, as another example, the cast of Stranger Things, who are quickly aging past their own characters). Julia Butters is going from one acclaimed director to another, though, as Steven Spielberg has cast her in a role inspired by his own sister in the untitled drama based on his own childhood years living in Arizona in the 1950s and 1960s. Butters is joining a cast that already includes Michelle Williams as the mom, Paul Dano as the dad, Seth Rogen as a favorite uncle, and Gabriel LaBelle as the fictionalized version of Steven himself. Australian actor Sam Rechner was also cast in the film this week as a high school classmate. Filming of this untitled drama (sometimes listed as The Fabelmans) is currently underway in Los Angeles, aiming for a theatrical release in 2022 after Steven Spielberg’s&nbsp;next film, the remake of West Side Story (12/20/2021).9. MGM TO REMAKE BLAXPLOITATION CLASSIC BLACULA(Photo by Everett Collection)For about 20 years now, MGM has been leaning heavily on remakes. Since 2010, MGM has remade Carrie, Hercules, Poltergeist, Ben-Hur, The Magnificent Seven, Death Wish, Tomb Raider, Overboard, A Star is Born, The Addams Family, and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (as The Hustle). We will soon be able to add the 1972 “blaxploitation” horror classic Blacula (Rotten at 48%) to that list, as the studio is indeed now developing a&nbsp;Blacula remake in association with Bron and Hidden Empire Film Group. The Blacula remake will be directed by Deon Taylor, whose previous films included Meet the Blacks (Rotten at 17%) and its sequel&nbsp;The House Next Door: Meet the Blacks 2. Blacula was followed a year later in 1973 by the sequel Scream Blacula Scream (Rotten at 29%), so this remake already has sequel potential.On an Apple device?

This week, new details emerged about the studio’s plans, including their goal of hiring a director of color for the job. Warner Bros. is reportedly working from a short list that includes Barry Jenkins (Moonlight), Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II), J.D. Dillard (Sleight), Regina King (One Night in Miami), and Shaka King (Judas and the Black Messiah). Ta-Nehisi Coates isn’t expected to finish his Superman screenplay until just before Christmas, but Warner Bros. appears to be motivated to use the rest of 2021 to gear up. That will also likely include casting their new Superman himself, and you can see some of the possible candidates in this piece. As for what Coates’ Superman screenplay is actually about, no villain has been revealed yet, but Superman is still expected to be Kal-El from the planet Krypton,&nbsp;and it might be a period piece set in the 20th century. This film is also not expected to be part of the DC Extended Universe (which includes The Flash, in which Sasha Calle will play the first Latina Supergirl), but will instead be more of a standalone film similar to Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker (Fresh at 68%), or the upcoming The Batman (3/4/2022), starring Robert Pattinson.Other Top Headlines1. MARVEL’S PHASE 4 TO INCLUDE THE MARVELS, BLACK PANTHER 2: WAKANDA FOREVER(Photo by Marvel Studios)As accessibility to COVID-19 vaccines promises the return of the moviegoing experience, Marvel Studios released a sizzle reel this week highlighting their upcoming films for 2021, 2022, and 2023, including what appears to be the rest of their Phase 4 roster. The video includes our first look at footage from Eternals (11/5/2021) from recent Academy Award-winning director Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) and a release date for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 (5/5/2023). Two of Marvel’s upcoming sequels also received new titles, as the movies formerly called Black Panther 2 and Captain Marvel 2 are now officially titled Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (7/8/2022) and The Marvels (11/11/2022), which will see Brie Larson’s Carol Danvers joined by Disney+ stars Teyonah Parris (Monica Rambeau from WandaVision) and Iman Vellani (Kamala Khan from the upcoming Ms. Marvel). The video ends with a blue 4 surrounded by a circle, which suggests the final film of Phase 4 will be Fantastic Four, although no release date is given, and we don’t know any cast yet.2. MARVEL’S BLADE REBOOT APPARENTLY DELAYED OUT OF PHASE 4(Photo by ©New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)At San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, Marvel Studios announced their films for Phase 4, as well as plans for Blade and Fantastic Four, which, at the time, were not expected to be included in Phase&nbsp; 4. This week, however, Fantastic Four seemed to be teased at the end of Marvel’s new sizzle reel, while the Blade reboot starring Mahershala Ali was missing altogether. As it turned out, an explanation for this was to be found somewhat buried in The Hollywood Reporter‘s story this week about Warner Bros.’ hunt for a Superman director. Although they have very little else in common, both Blade and Superman will feature black leads, and both studios are seeking black or African American directors, which&nbsp;means both Marvel and Warner Bros. are working from similar shortlists of possible directors. It’s for this reason that Marvel has apparently pushed the production start date of Blade&nbsp;from this September back almost a year to July, 2022 instead. In addition to giving Marvel more time to hire their Blade director, this delay will also allow screenwriter Stacy Osei-Kuffour (HBO’s Watchmen) more time to fine-tune&nbsp; the Blade screenplay.3. JOJO RABBIT STAR TO PORTRAY OLYMPIC GYMNAST KERRI STRUG(Photo by Scott Green/©Bleecker Street Media)Currently 20 years old, New Zealand actress Thomasin McKenzie had a major breakout role in 2018’s&nbsp;Leave No Trace (Certified Fresh at 100%), which was followed one year later by Taika Waititi’s Jojo Rabbit (Certified Fresh at 80%), in which she was basically the female lead (Scarlett Johansson played more of a supporting role). McKenzie&nbsp;has stayed pretty busy in the last two years (even with COVID-19), which includes roles in M. Night Shyamalan’s Old (7/23/2021), Edgar Wright’s Last Night in Soho (10/22/2021), and Jane Campion’s The Power of the Dog. Actress-turned-director Olivia Wilde has also been staying busy following her directorial debut with Booksmart (Certified Fresh at 96%), as she recently wrapped Don’t Worry Darling (starring Flroence Pugh, Harry Styles, and Chris Pine), and she’s also developing a Sony Pictures superhero movie expected to be Spider-Woman (or something similar). Last year, just before the COVID-19 pandemic fully struck, Wilde also signed on to direct a biopic called Perfect, about 1992 and 1996 Olympic gymnast Kerri Strug, and it appears Perfect is getting closer to being Wilde’s next as director. Thomasin McKenzie is now signed to star in Perfect as Strug, who is perhaps best known for participating in the vault competition despite an injured knee, which meant that she then had to be carried to the podium by her coach. Filming of Perfect is expected to start in January following the release of Don’t Worry, Darling.4. TENET STAR TEAMING UP WITH ROGUE ONE DIERCTOR FOR TRUE LOVE(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/©Warner Bros.)As COVID-19 kept many theaters in the USA closed for at least several months, many films were delayed until 2021, and others were picked up by various streaming outlets (and still are doing so). One of the directors who didn’t give up on a theatrical release (for better or worse) was Christopher Nolan, whose Tenet (Fresh at 70%) was released in theaters unlike many other Warner Bros. films, which debuted instead on HBO Max. The star of Tenet was John David Washington (BlacKkKlansman, Malcolm &amp; Marie), and this week, Washington signed on to star in the next film&nbsp;from another sc-fi/action director, as he&nbsp;will star in a&nbsp;new film called True Love for director Gareth Edwards (Monsters, Godzilla, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story). The premise of True Love is being kept secret, except that it’s a sci-fi story set in the near future, and the title also obviously suggests a romantic element.5. AMY ADAMS TO STAR AS A SCIENTIST WHOSE WORK INSPIRED JAMES CAMERON’S AVATAR(Photo by Jef Hernandez/Everett Collection)The world is still waiting for James Cameron’s first Avatar sequel, which is currently scheduled for December 16, 2022, eight years after the sequel’s first announced release date in 2014. As it might turn out, another movie related to Avatar could feasibly end up being released before Avatar 2. Amy Adams’ Bond Group Entertainment and Jake Gyllenhaal’s Nine Stories production companies are teaming up for an adaptation of the memoir Finding the Mother Tree by scientist Suzanne Simard, with Amy Adams also attached to star in the film as Simard. The memoir is described as a scientific detective story about Simard’s studies into the hidden fungus networks underground that trees use to communicate. The connection to Avatar comes in the form of the “Tree of Souls” featured in that film, which was inspired by Simard’s work.6. IT DIRECTOR TEAMING UP WITH THE COUPLE BEHIND THE BIG SICK(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)After years of delays (it was once scheduled for release on March 23, 2018), Warner Bros.’ The Flash has finally started filming under director Andy Muschietti (Mama, IT, IT: Chapter Two), and at the same time, Muschietti has already started developing&nbsp;another future project. Muschietti and his wife Barbara are teaming up with another husband-wife duo, Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, who co-wrote the 2017 indie comedy hit The Big Sick (Certified Fresh at 98%), based on their own experiences together. The project bringing these two couples together is an adaptation&nbsp; ofthe Edward Gorey illustrated book The Doubtful Guest, which tells the story of a strange penguin-like creature that drops in unexpectedly at a family manor. It’s not yet clear if the film will be adapted as live action (perhaps with a tone like The Babadook), a live-action children’s movie, or something else.7. KAITLYN DEVER FROM BOOKSMART LANDS ROMEO &amp; JULIET SPINOFF(Photo by Francois Duhamel/©Annapurna Pictures)In literature, there is a form of story called “parallel fiction,” in which characters from popular works are expanded upon in their own stories. Famous examples of this include Wicked (from The Wizard of Oz), The Mists of Avalon (from the Arthurian Legends), Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (from Hamlet), and Alan Moore’s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (from dozens of Victorian Era works). This story involves a supporting character from William Shakespeare’s Romeo &amp; Juliet getting her own movie, starring Kaitlyn Dever from Booksmart (Certified Fresh at 96%). That character will be Rosaline, who was Juliet’s cousin, and at the beginning of Shakespeare’s play, Romeo’s romantic interest. Rosaline will be a modern, revisionist, rom-com take on the entire story (which suggests something more like 10 Things I Hate About You or Clueless), and it&nbsp;makes its way to production at 20th Century Studios after a long development cycle at MGM.8. OWEN WILSON’S SECRET HEADQUARTERS TO BE DISCOVERED(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)In the CW superhero series Stargirl, Luke Wilson plays a former superhero sidekick who secretly moves back to his hometown, where he has a secret base in a car garage where he keeps a 15-foot-tall robot. That particular character beat might be a coincidence, but this week, Luke’s brother Owen Wilson signed with producer Jerry Bruckheimer to star in a family-friendly superhero action movie called Secret Headquarters. It’s not yet known for sure who&nbsp;Wilson will be playing, but the premise of Secret Headquarters is about “a kid who discovers the secret headquarters of the world’s most powerful superhero hidden beneath his home and must defend it with his group of friends when villains attack.” From that, we can probably guess that Wilson might be the hero in question, one of the supervillains, or the kid’s dad. Secret Headquarters will be directed by the team of Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, who also directed the Netflix movie Project Power (Fresh at 61%).9. MARVEL VILLAIN HANNAH JOHN-KAMEN TO DON THE ARMOR OF RED SONJA&nbsp;(Photo by Ben Rothstein/©Marvel/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Some movies have roads to production that are relatively easy to explain, and then there’s Red Sonja. Originally created by Marvel Comics as a supporting character&nbsp;in Conan the Barbarian (not the movie), Red Sonja eventually got her own movie in 1985, starring Brigitte Nielsen and Arnold Schwarzenegger, except that he wasn’t playing Conan the Barbarian, which remains a weird thing that happened. Fast forward to the 2000s, when director Robert Rodriguez spent several years trying to remake Red Sonja&nbsp;and got as far as making a poster with Rose McGowan in costume kneeling above a release year of 2009… and then that didn’t happen either. Then,&nbsp;it also didn’t happen under director Bryan Singer. Long story short, this week, Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost from Ant-Man and the Wasp) is now officially attached to star as Red Sonja for indie director Joey Soloway. We should note that the Red Sonja rights (and the Conan rights, and the Robert E. Howard stories she’s loosely based on) have all exchanged hands repeatedly since the 1970s, so this Red Sonja movie is now basically its own thing, and is unlikely to have any connections to Conan (and definitely not Marvel).On an Apple device?

If you haven’t seen or finished that show yet, just stop here and enjoy wondering how Marvel will bring back Chris Evans as the title character. For those still reading, because obviously, that spoiler warning totally worked, you now know that the star of Captain America 4 will be Anthony Mackie, formerly known as The Falcon (or to some, Black Falcon), who took over as Captain America by the end of the show. Captain America 4&nbsp;will very much be a creative continuation of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, as its showrunner (and head writer) Malcolm Spellman will be co-writing the film with Dalan Musson, one of the show’s staff writers. Technically, no casting has been done yet for Captain America 4, but Anthony Mackie is almost certainly a sure thing, and some of the other of the show’s characters, like Bucky (Sebastian Stan), Baron Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), and U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell) could also return. Captain America 4 also doesn’t have a director yet, but many people online are suggesting that the show’s director, Kari Skogland, should return to helm this feature as well. For more insight into where Captain America 4 might go next, check out this interview with Spellman. Marvel Studios has not yet announced a release date for Captain America 4, but it’s unlikely to be anytime before 2023.Other Top Headlines1. THE GODZILLA VS. KONG MONSTERVERSE WILL CONTINUE, POSSIBLY WITH SON OF KONG(Photo by Everett Collection)Once upon a time, when Legendary Pictures first struck a deal with Japan’s Godzilla home company Toho to make English-language films,&nbsp;it was for four movies, of which&nbsp;Godzilla vs. Kong (Certified Fresh at 75%) was the fourth. It was for that reason that many fans expected that the “Monsterverse” was probably going to end there (and also due to fears that COVID-19 would keep the box office down). The pandemic almost certainly did leave a pawprint on the box office, but $406 million and counting (globally) is still pretty great, and on HBO Max, Godzilla vs. Kong also beat the first week viewing numbers for the heavily promoted Zack Snyder’s Justice League. Given all those factors, Legendary has indeed begun talks with director Adam Wingard about a sequel that is rumored to be titled Son of Kong, which would be a direct reference to the 1933 sequel (Rotten at 42%) with a very different premise than we’re likely to see (since Kong: Skull Island did not feature the Carl Denham filmmaker character). Of course, the tease of Son of Kong also suggests the existence of a “Mrs. Kong.” Whatever it ends up being, this sequel&nbsp;is at least a few years away, as Wingard is expected to direct both his Face/Off sequel and the live action ThunderCats before it.2. LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO REMAKE ACADEMY AWARD WINNER ANOTHER ROUND(Photo by ©Samuel Goldwyn Films)As with pretty much every year of the Academy Awards, this week’s ceremony had both snubs and surprises, but people tend to talk less about about the winners that weren’t&nbsp;so surprising. For example, in the Best International Feature category, Thomas Vinterberg’s film about Danish day-drinking educators, Another Round (Certified Fresh at 92%), was expected by many to win, and it did. Within hours of that win, Leonardo DiCaprio’s Appian Way production company swooped in&nbsp;and acquired the rights for an English-language remake. DiCaprio is not currently attached to star in the remake, but there’s definitely a good chance that he could (presumably as the lead character played by Mads Mikkelsen in the Danish version).&nbsp;He also was not the only Hollywood star who tried to land the Another Round remake, as both Jake Gyllenhaal and Elizabeth Banks also made bids on it. Another Round was actually called Druk in Denmark (Danish for “Drunk”), so it’s possible that the remake could follow suit and&nbsp;take the&nbsp;title Drunk as well.3. LOVECRAFT COUNTRY WRITER WORKING ON CLEOPATRA JONES REMAKE(Photo by Everett Collection)The early 1970s explosion of “Blaxploitation” movies featuring African American leads is often called a genre, but it was more of an industry umbrella under which films of many different genres were produced. Consider, for example, the 1973 film Cleopatra Jones (Fresh at 79%), which was basically a spy spoof (the villain was Shelley Winters as an international opium drug lord called Mommy, and Cleopatra Jones was a secret agent). The news first broke in 2017 that Warner Bros. had started development on a Cleopatra Jones remake, but it took three and a half years for the studio to make the next move by hiring a screenwriter. That job has gone to Ihuoma Ofordire, one of the writers of the series Lovecraft Country on HBO (also a corporate cousin of Warner Bros). Warner Bros. has not yet announced who might star as their new Cleopatra Jones, but it should be noted that Ofordire is also an actress.4. SAUSAGE PARTY DIRECTOR TO REMAKE CHILDREN’S FILM THE BORROWERS &nbsp;(Photo by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment courtesy Everett Collection)Sometimes, film development news brings together rather disparate elements. Let’s start at the beginning, which was the 1952 children’s fantasy novel The Borrowers by English author Mary Norton, about a family of tiny people who secretly live underneath humans from whom they borrow small objects (which are big to them). That book was then adapted in 1997 as a live-action movie (Fresh at 73%) starring John Goodman and Jim Broadbent, and then adapted again by Studio Ghibli as the anime movie The Secret World of Arrietty (Certified Fresh at 95%). Universal Pictures and Working Title are now developing a third adaptation which will again be live-action and&nbsp;be called The Borrowers. The screenplay will be written by Patrick Burleigh (co-writer of Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway) and will be directed by Conrad Vernon (The Addams Family, Sausage Party). So, to loop back, the same project ties in English fantasy, Japanese anime, and an R-rated animated film. Like we said, “disparate.”5. VIGGO MORTENSEN, LEA SEYDOUX, KRISTEN STEWART JOIN&nbsp;DAVID CRONENBERG’S NEXT FILM(Photo by Priscilla Grant, Jason Mendez/Everett Collection)Canadian directgor David Cronenberg is well known among horror and science fiction fans for his films from the 1970s (Shivers, Rabid, The Brood) and 1980s (Scanners, Videodrome, The Dead Zone, The Fly, Dead Ringers), but the earliest of those aforementioned films (Shivers) was actually his third after Stereo in 1969 and Crimes of the Future in 1970, both of which are barely over an hour long. That second film seems quite relevant to this week’s news, because Cronenberg is making another film called&nbsp;Crimes of the Future, though it’s not yet clear if the two are otherwise related. The project is expected to start filming in Greece this summer, and Cronenberg has already found his three leads, who will be Viggo Mortensen, Léa Seydoux, and Kristen Stewart. Mortensen previously starred in both A History of Violence and Eastern Promises, making Crimes of the Future their third project together. Crimes of the Future is billed as Cronenberg’s first original science fiction project since 1999’s eXistenZ, which seems to suggest no direct connection between this upcoming film and&nbsp;the 1970 movie.6. GAL GADOT SAYS MEET ME IN ANOTHER LIFE(Photo by RCF/Everett Collection)In Wonder Woman and its recent sequel Wonder Woman 1984, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine played lovers who are brought back together through magic after decades apart (a separation that, for one of them, was also between life and death and then life again). Considering that, one might make the argument that this week’s news seems not entirely coincidental, because Gadot is going to produce and star in a film called Meet Me in Another Life. Gadot’s production company Pilot Wave snapped up the rights to the recent novel by Catriona Silvey extremely fast; the book was published this week on Tuesday, April 27th, and Gadot had the feature film rights to the book on the next day. Gal Gadot is a speed reader, apparently. As the title suggests, Meet Me in Another Life will tell the story of a romance between a man and a woman who continue to meet each other across time and reality, challenging them to figure out exactly why that keeps happening.7. FLORENCE PUGH TO STAR IN YET ANOTHER MOVIE WITH WONDER IN THE TITLE&nbsp;(Photo by A24)In the last 10 years (or so), we’ve had&nbsp;several films whose titles included some variation of the word “wonder”:&nbsp;To the Wonder (2012), The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013), Professor Marston and the Wonder Women (2017), Wonder (2017), Wonder Wheel (2017), Wonder Woman (2017), Wonderstruck (2017), Wonder Park (2019), Wonder Woman: Bloodlines (2019), Wonder Woman 1984 (2020), and Willy’s Wonderland (2021). That’s an impressive list, but you might notice none of them was THE Wonder, and actress Florence Pugh is about to correct that oversight, as she will star in an adaptation of the novel The Wonder by author Emma Donoghue (who also wrote Room). The film, to be directed by Sebastian Lelio (A Fantastic Woman) will tell the story of an English nurse (Pugh) who is summoned to a tiny Irish village in the 1850s to observe what the locals believe to be a miracle. Sounds wonderful, doesn’t it?On an Apple device?

Even so, Zack Snyder’s Justice League is something of a superhero curio. Ben Affleck won’t be starring in next year’s The Batman (Robert Pattinson is), Warner Bros. is rebooting Superman without Henry Cavill, and Ray Fisher is done as Cyborg. To his credit, Snyder has been pretty straightforward this week when asked about the situation, with the gist being that Zack Snyder’s Justice League is not to be considered a part of the DCEU “canon.” Snyder said that the original plan was for this Justice League to be followed by two more films, but now, “Warner Bros. hasn’t really expressed any interest in making more movies with me, and that’s 100% fine. I understand.”&nbsp;Snyder may be done with the Justice League, but both The Flash (11/4/2022) (featuring Ben Affleck as Batman) and Wonder Woman 3 remain in active production or development.Other Top Headlines1. BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH TO STAR AS REAL LIFE WAR MAGICIAN(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)Benedict Cumberbatch first became famous for starring as TV’s Sherlock, but in the years since, his most famous role has since become Marvel Studios’ Doctor Strange (Certified Fresh at 89%), with Cumberbatch now filming the sequel Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&nbsp;(3/25/2022). Cumberbatch’s Marvel character is obviously fictional, but for his latest project,&nbsp;he will star as a real life British illusionist&nbsp;Japser Maskelyne, who assisted the World War II war effort. The film will be called&nbsp;War Magician, which will be the next&nbsp;project from director Colin Trevorrow after recently wrapping production on&nbsp;Jurassic World: Dominion (6/10/2022). Jasper Maskelyne famously worked with the British military to create large scale illusions to deceive and disrupt the Nazi invasion forces, such as huge balloon tanks to inflate the size of British forces, and hide “escape tools” like blades or maps in combs and playing cards.2. ANTONIO BANDERAS TO RETURN AS PUSS IN BOOTS NEXT YEAR(Photo by Paramount Pictures)In 2016, DreamWorks Animation was officially acquired by NBC/Universal, which was good news for some projects, but seemed to slow down others, such as the Shrek franchise in general (the most recent Shrek feature film was Shrek Forever After in 2010). This year will also mark the 10th anniversary of the Shrek spinoff Puss in Boots, starring Antonio Banderas as the feline swashbuckler, but Universal confirmed this week that another Puss in Boots will be released by the end of next year (9/23/2022). The title of the sequel will be Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, and Banderas is confirmed to be returning to voice the title character, although no other voice cast have been announced. DreamWorks Animation is also developing a return to the main Shrek franchise, but it appears that Puss in Boots will get his sequel first.3. EZRA MILLER’S THE FLASH GAINS A MOM AND LOSES A DAD(Photo by Warner Bros.)If you had four free hours in the last day or so to watch Zack Snyder’s Justice League, you may have noticed that the film’s cast (as did Joss Whedon’s version) included Billy Crudup as Henry Allen, the father of Barry Allen, A.K.A.&nbsp;The Flash. Crudup was also one of the first actors to start negotiations to reprise the role for The Flash (11/4/2022). As it turns out, however,&nbsp;he is now dropping out of&nbsp;The Flash due to scheduling conflicts with his role on the Apple+ drama The Morning Show. It’s unclear whether the role will be recast, but at the same time as Crudup is dropping out, Spanish actress Maribel Verdú (Pan’s Labyrinth, Y Tu Mama Tambien) has joined the film as Barry Allen’s mother. Verdú joins a growing ensemble cast that will also include Ezra Miller (Barry Allen), Kiersey Clemons (Iris West), Ben Affleck (Batman), Michael Keaton (also Batman), and Sasha Calle (Supergirl). The Flash will be directed by Andy Muschietti (IT, Mama), working from a screenplay by Christina Hodson (Birds of Prey, Bumblebee).4. THE TIME IS FINALLY RIGHT FOR GOLDEN AGE SUPERHERO HOURMAN&nbsp;(Photo by The CW)The timelines and chronologies of comic book superheroes can often be confusing to follow, in no small part because so many of the characters date back over 50 years (or, in some cases, more than 75 years). One way that DC Comics has handled&nbsp;this is through what DC calls “legacy characters,” in which younger versions of superheroes are introduced over time, resulting in a family of heroes that eventually all have the same superhero name (there have been, for example, almost a dozen different heroes called Starman).&nbsp;One of those DC Comics “legacy heroes” is Hourman, who was first introduced in 1940 as a hero who acquired superpowers for one hour at a time by taking a drug (which writers later&nbsp;explored in the form of drug addiction). The son of the original Hourman also became Hourman (a version of which currently co-stars on The CW’s Stargirl), and in the 1990s, there was a time travelling android called Hourman, too. Despite celebrating his 80th anniversary last year, Hourman has never been in a live-action feature film, but Warner Bros. is now developing a movie that will finally correct that. Warner Bros., DC Films, and Chernin Entertainment are collaborating on a Hourman movie, starting with the hiring of screenwriters Gavin James and Neil Widener, who have also worked together in the past on the (not yet produced) sequels Now You See Me 3 and San Andreas 2. It is not yet known which of the Hourman heroes from the comics will be adapted for the Hourman movie.5. BATGIRL AND ZATANNA BOTH PART OF MYSTERIOUS WB/DC PLANS(Photo by ©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Back in December, Disney revealed dozens of new projects during their Disney Investor Day event, with the biggest emphasis being on Disney+ (though not exclusively). Disney’s most obvious direct competition is Warner Bros. and DC Comics (as evidenced this week by the close proximity between the streaming premieres of Zack Snyder’s Justice League and The Falcon and The Winter Soldier). This week, AT&amp;T (the parent company of Warner Bros.) included a tease screen of 24 DC Comics projects currently in production or development, although the presentation did not go into as much detail for each project as Disney’s did. That means that there were a few projects that were “confirmed” without us necessarily knowing what was confirmed. Specifically, the two highest profile projects confirmed this week were Batgirl and Zatanna. This is the biggest Batgirl movie news since 2017, when Joss Whedon had been working on a Batgirl project concurrent to finishing Justice League (though he dropped out of it&nbsp;just a few months later). As for the magical superhero Zatanna, she’s come close to making her live-action feature film debut as part of Justice League Dark in the last ten years, but this appears to be a solo Zatanna project. It’s also important to note that the presentation did not specify whether Batgirl and Zatanna will be theatrically released Warner Bros. feature films, or whether they might be intended exclusively for HBO Max. &nbsp;6. ANDY GARCIA TO BE LATINX FATHER OF THE BRIDE(Photo by ©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Spencer Tracy and a young Elizabeth Taylor starred as the title characters in the classic 1950 romantic comedy Father of the Bride&nbsp;(Fresh at 90%), which received a Steve Martin-led remake in 1991 (Fresh at 70%) that was itself popular enough to get a sequel in 1995 (Rotten at 50%). Last month, Warner Bros. revealed that the studio is developing another remake with a Latinx focus, and this week, we found out who will be&nbsp;the titular father.&nbsp;That man&nbsp;will be Andy Garcia, who will star as the father of a Cuban-American family, with Garcia also serving as executive producer. It sounds like Warner Bros. is fast-tracking&nbsp;Father of the Bride, so we should hear about more casting for other members of the family soon.7. YOUNG ROYALS FROM BLACK PANTHER AND THE CROWN JOIN PROVISION(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)This may be a total (or near total) coincidence, but Letitia Wright played a Wakandan princess in Black Panther, and Josh O’Connor starred in seasons 3 and 4 of Netflix’s The Crown as the young Prince Charles, and now, they’re both signed to star in the same movie. Wright and O’Connor have both signed&nbsp;to star in the Irish drama Provision, which will depict the harrowing immigration process in Ireland. Wright will play a “a young African woman fleeing persecution who ends up spending over two years in Ireland’s asylum system” who befriends a security guard played by O’Connor.8. DANIEL RADCLIFFE JOURNEYING TO SANDRA BULLOCK’S LOST CITY OF D(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Warner Bros.)Like many of his Harry Potter costars, Daniel Radcliffe has spent most of his post-Potterverse career focusing on more indie projects (such as Swiss Army Man, in which&nbsp;he played a superpowered corpse), often in roles that are more ambiguous than his strictly heroic turn as Harry Potter. This week, Radcliffe signed on to star as the main villain&nbsp;in Paramount Pictures’ romantic adventure Lost City of D, starring Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. The premise of&nbsp;Lost City of D&nbsp;sounds a lot like the 1980s classic Romancing the Stone, as Sandra Bullock will play a romance novelist who gets kidnapped (or targeted for kidnapping) alongside the model (Channing Tatum) who poses on her book covers.9. JAMIE FOXX AND&nbsp;JAIME LANNISTER KNOW GOD IS A BULLET(Photo by Priscilla Grant, JA/Everett Collection)Perhaps it’s an example of “apophenia,” but sometimes, the coincidences in casting announcements can be hard not to notice. For example, Jamie Foxx’s new co-star in the action thriller God Is a Bullet is Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who is most famous for playing Jaime Lannister in HBO’s Game of Thrones (the slight spelling difference between Jamie and Jaime notwithstanding). Foxx and Coster-Waldau will be leading an ensemble cast that will also include January Jones (Mad Men), Maika Monroe (It Follows), and Andrew Dice Clay. Written and directed by Nick Cassavetes (The Notebook, John Q), God Is a Bullet will tell the story of a detective (Coster-Waldrau) whose family is murdered by a Satanic cult, which leads him to quit the force to infiltrate the cult, aided by the only woman (Maika Monroe) to ever escape it. Incidentally, Nick Cassavetes’ father John Cassavetes himself starred in one of the most famous movies ever about a Satanic cult, Rosemary’s Baby (Certified Fresh at 96%).On an Apple device?

The Star Wars feature film that was not even remotely mentioned (to the point that one might have assumed&nbsp;it might be cancelled) was the project announced in September, 2019 as being produced by Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige (though Kathleen Kennedy did clarify that it was a “ways off”). We can now guess that maybe Disney just wasn’t quite ready to announce this week’s news, which is that Feige’s Star Wars project is now to be written by Rick and Morty (Fresh at 94%) producer Michael Waldron. Besides Rick and Morty (and HarmonQuest), Waldron has two more direct connections to Feige and Marvel, as he is also writing Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (3/25/2022), and was also the head writer on the upcoming Disney+ show Loki (expected to start streaming in May, 2021). In related news (sort of), Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot also recently signed with Warner Bros. for Wonder Woman 3, although it’s unclear if it will be produced before or after Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, or what it might be about. As for Waldron, he is also expected to work on season 2 of Loki, which is also news because Loki was previously thought to be a one-season miniseries.Other Top Headlines1. EX MACHINA DIRECTOR RECRUITS I’M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS STAR FOR MEN(Photo by Mary Cybulski/©Netflix)Although English filmmaker Alex Garland may still lack the name brand recognition of some of his colleagues, his science fiction work both as screenwriter (28 Days Later, Sunshine) and director (Ex Machina, Annihilation) has consistently been Fresh on the Tomatometer for 20 years. For his next film, Garland may be switching things up a little bit, as the project called Men is described as a low-budget horror film set in the U.K. about a young woman “who goes on a solo vacation to the English countryside after the death of her husband.” The two main stars will be Irish actress Jessie Buckley (Netflix’s I’m Thinking of Ending Things, Certified Fresh at 81%) and England’s Rory Kinnear (probably best known as the current iteration of MI6 suit Bill Tanner in the James Bond franchise). Men will be distributed by A24, which was also the company behind Ex Machina.2. MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL TO RETURN AS SPAMALOT MOVIE(Photo by Everett Collection)Plenty of comedians make the jump from TV to film, but few have a hit that is held in quite as high esteem as 1975’s Monty Python and the Holy Grail&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 97%). In 2005, a stage musical called Spamalot, adapted from the movie by Monty Python member Eric Idle, made its debut on Broadway, and to date, the musical has earned over $175 million during its various worldwide runs. In 2018, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to make a Spamalot movie, but the project appeared to stall after the Fox film properties were acquired by Disney in 2019. Instead, Paramount Pictures has now stepped in to actually produce the Spamalot movie, which arrives at Paramount from Fox “fully developed,” with a screenplay by Eric Idle and the musical’s choreographer Casey Nicholaw attached to possibly make his feature film directorial debut (depending upon which gets produced first, Spamalot&nbsp;or the movie adaptation of the Mean Girls stage musical). It’s not yet known if any of the various stage performers will reprise their roles in the movie, but some of those possible stars include Tim Curry (Arthur), Hank Azaria (Lancelot), and David Hyde Pierce (Sir Robin).3. HBO STAR NOMA DUMEZWENI TO PLAY NEW CHARACTER IN THE LITTLE MERMAID(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)As Disney continues to adapt their classic animated movies as new live-action films, their approach has varied as to exactly how closely the premise and casts stick to the original film, from pretty spot on&nbsp;(The Lion King, The Jungle Book) to quite, quite different (Mulan, Aladdin). Until this week, most of the casting we’d heard about The Little Mermiad suggested something closer to the former, as all of the confirmed characters seemed to be directly from the original 1989 film (Certified Fresh at 93%). To refresh the reader’s memory, the announced cast so far includes Grown-ish co-star Halle Bailey as Ariel, Jonah Hauer-King as Prince Eric, Awkwafina as Scuttle, Javier Bardem as Triton, Daveed Diggs as Sebastian, Jacob Tremblay as Flounder, and Melissa McCarthy as the evil octopus sea witch Ursula. To that list, we can now add Noma Dumezweni (HBO’s The Undying), except that she will be playing an entirely new character who wasn’t in the 1989 original. Walt Disney Pictures has not yet scheduled The Little Mermaid, but we can probably presume it will be sometime in either 2022 or 2023. Dumezweni previously worked with Disney as Miss Penny Farthing in 2018’s Mary Poppins Returns (Certified Fresh at 79%).4. TIFFANY HADDISH TO STAR IN ALIEN INVASION FILM LANDSCAPE WITH INVISIBLE HAND(Photo by Michele K. Short/Universal Pictures)One of the stories that broke during the Weekly Ketchup’s three week holiday break was about Brad Pitt’s Plan B making a deal with MGM for their adaptation of the “dark, surreal comedy” sci-fi novel Landscape with Invisible Hand, set in a future after the Earth has been invaded by an alien force. (This news came three years after Plan B first acquired the rights to the novel in 2017, but slow development isn’t that unusual.) The MGM deal may have helped Landscape with Invisible Hand continue to move forward, because we can also already now report that Tiffany Haddish is in final negotiations with MGM and Plan B to star in Landscape with Invisible Hand, although it’s unclear which role she will play. The premise is described as being about two human teenagers who come up with a scheme to make money in Earth’s devastated econonmy by “broadcasting their dating life to the fascinated aliens,” except that they eventually “come to hate each other [but] can’t break up without bankrupting their families.” Landscape with Invisible Hand will be directed by Cory Finley (Bad Education, Certified Fresh at 94%&nbsp;and Thoroughbreds, Certified Fresh at 86%).5. CARY ELWES JOINS GUY RITCHIE’S SPY THRILLER FIVE EYES(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and everything else going on the world, there are probably some movies that are getting released to much more obscurity than they would’ve otherwise. One such film is Wrath of Man, the latest crime drama directed by Guy Ritchie (Aladdin, The Gentlemen, Sherlock Holmes), whose films are usually much more prominent (and that’s without mentioning the film’s star, Jason Statham). For his part, Ritchie is moving forward with another project, a spy thriller called Five Eyes, which will start filming at locations in Turkey and Qatar later this month. We’ve known for a while that the two leads in Five Eyes will be Aubrey Plaza and Jason Statham (his fourth&nbsp;collaboration with Ritchie), and as of this week, we can add Cary Elwes to the cast as well. Elwes will play the espionage operator who teams up Statham’s MI6 super spy with Aubrey Plaza’s high tech expert CIA agent.6. CAN ANYONE SOLVE HOW TO TURN RUBIK’S CUBE INTO A MOVIE?(Photo by Vladimir Smirnov/Getty Images)It’s been a few years since we&nbsp;regularly saw movie pitches being sold for non-narrative toys and games like Viewmaster, Play-Doh, and Pez, but thankfully, most of those are either still spinning around in development or have since been shelved. Unfortunately, The Emoji Movie&nbsp;(Rotten at 7%) still happened. With all of that in mind, the latest toy to get its own movie deal is the puzzle box and nostalgia artifact that is the Rubik’s Cube. The producers appear to be name checking&nbsp;Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit in an effort to demonstrate how a movie like&nbsp;Rubik’s Cube&nbsp;can be successful. Rubik’s Cube will be a joint production between Hyde Park Entertainment Group (Blue Valentine, Machete) and Endeavor Content (Hamilton, Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood). Hyde Park is also developing a TV game show based on Rubik’s Cube.7. RAY FISHER’S CYBORG NOT GETTING HIS OWN MOVIE AFTER ALL (OR A ROLE IN THE FLASH)(Photo by ©Warner Bros. Pictures)It was just a little over six years ago that Warner Bros. held their big DC Comics movie event, during&nbsp;which they announced a few movies that did happen (Aquaman, Shazam and Wonder Woman), at least one we’re still waiting on (The Flash), and a few that didn’t (Cyborg, Green Lantern, Justice League Part Two). The Cyborg movie was actually originally supposed to be released over 8 months ago, but the last week has seen a flurry of stories bout Cyborg and that last delayed film that’s actually happening, The Flash. It all started just before the New Year, as Cyborg actor Ray Fisher continued to speak out against the way he felt Warner Bros. handled his reports of misconduct during the Justice League reshoots, which led to Fisher announcing that he was dropping out from ever playing Cyborg again. Soon after, Warner Bros. confirmed that Cyborg’s cameo role in The Flash had been written out, and that the role would not be recast. WarnerMedia also put out a statement last night confirming that longtime DC Comics writer and producer Geoff Johns is still working for the company (reversing a Ray Fisher social media statement). Even without Cyborg, The Flash&nbsp;should still be a superhero-filled adventure, with the expected cast so far including Ezra Miller as The Flash, Billy Crudup as his father, and at least two different Batmen (Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton, despite some recent rumors to the contrary). Warner Bros. has scheduled The Flash for November 4, 2022, wrapping up a year that is expected to also include The Batman, Aquaman 2, and Black Adam.On an Apple device?

Adapted from the children’s literature character that first appeared in the 1958 book A Bear Called Paddington, the 2014 film Paddington received a Certified Fresh score of 97% and its 2017 sequel Paddington 2&nbsp;still holds the record as the film with the most reviews to be Certified Fresh at 100% on the Tomatometer.&nbsp;Paul King, who wrote and directed the first two films, has said that he would not be directing a Paddington 3 if one was to ever happen, and we already know that King’s next film will be the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory prequel Wonka for St. Patrick’s Day, 2023. Combined, the two Paddington movies earned over $500 million worldwide ($280 million and $225 million). No casting announcements for Paddington 3 have been made yet, but the film franchise’s ensemble cast (not counting film-specific antagonists) includes Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters, and the voices of Ben Whishaw (Paddington) and Imelda Staunton (Paddington’s Aunt Lucy).Other Top Headlines1. DANIEL KALUUYA IN TALKS FOR&nbsp;REUNION WITH JORDAN PEELE(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)To date, Jordan Peele has only directed two feature films, but both Get Out (Certified Fresh at 98%) and Us (Certified Fresh at 93%)&nbsp;have been box office hits, with each coincidentally earning $255 million worldwide. Expectations are high, then for his untitled third film, which Universal Pictures is helping by calling it a “horror event title” scheduled for July 22, 2022. Jordan Peele is now getting his cast for that film together this week, with singer and actress Keke Palmer (Akeelah and the Bee, Certified Fresh at 85%) being the first to officially be confirmed. Peele’s Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya is also in talks for one of the film’s leads, but his deal hasn’t yet been finalized. Similarly, Fargo and Game Night star Jesse Plemons was also in talks for a role recently, but his deal fell apart due to a scheduling conflict (possibly because he also signed with Apple TV+ this week to star in Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon).2. JOAQUIN PHOENIX TO STAR IN&nbsp;ARI ASTER’S NEXT FILM(Photo by Warner Bros.)Jordan Peele isn’t the only director who’s recently had two critical hits with his first two horror films, as Ari Aster pulled off&nbsp;a similar feat with&nbsp;Hereditary (Certified Fresh at 89%) and Midsommar (Certified Fresh at 83%). For his third film, Aster has recruited four-time Academy Award nominee and recent winner of the Academy Award for Best Actor&nbsp;Joaquin Phoenix to star in a film called Disappointment Blvd. The exact genre for the A24 production is unclear, as the premise is described as “an intimate, decades-spanning portrait of one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time,” which doesn’t sound like a horror film, but this report describes the film as a “surrealist horror film set in an alterate present.” Joaquin Phoenix is expected to film Disappointment Blvd sometime later this year before moving on to star as Napoleon Bonaparte in Ridley Scott’s Kitbag.3. NEW SUPERGIRL TO MAKE HER DEBUT IN THE FLASH(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)It’s been 37 years since Helen Slater starred in the famously terrible&nbsp;Supergirl&nbsp;(Rotten at 9%), and in that time, Melissa Benoist has gone a long way toward making amends in the popular CW series&nbsp;Supergirl. That said, we’re due to get yet another iteration of the character in the upcoming DCEU film The Flash. After director Andy Muschietti (Mama, IT) reportedly saw the auditions of over 425 actresses, the role of Supergirl in The Flash (11/4/2022) has gone to relative unknown Sasha Calle, who currently co-stars in the daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless. The 25-year-old Boston-born Colombian actress will also have the distinction of being the first Latina actress to portray Supergirl in any format (TV, animation, etc). The other 400+ actresses reportedly did not know what role they were auditioning for until very late in the process, at which point Sasha Calle had a chemistry reading with The Flash star Ezra Miller (over Zoom). It’s not yet known in which other future DCEU films Calle might reprise her role as Supergirl. In related news, Marwan Kenzari, who co-starred as Jafar in Aladdin, has also joined the DCEU film Black Adam in an unknown role.4. PARAMOUNT TO REMAKE CLASSIC MUSICAL THE KING AND I&nbsp;(Photo by ©20th Century Fox Film Corp.)In recent weeks, we’ve heard about new efforts to remake both Breaklast at Tiffany’s and The Wizard of Oz, and this week, we can add another classic from over 50 years ago to the list. There have been multiple adaptations of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I, or the true story that inspired it, but the most famous is the 1956 film starring Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr. That film was produced and distributed by 20th Century Fox, but the remake rights have now landed at Paramount Pictures, which is partnering with Temple Hill, the production company behind recent movies like Love, Simon (Certified Fresh at 91%) and Happiest Season (Certified Fresh at 83%). The 1956 version of The King &amp; I received nine Academy Award nominations and won five: Best Actor (Yul Brynner), Best Color Art Direction, Best Color Costume Design, Best Score, and Best Sound Recording.&nbsp;The film was also nominated for Best Picture, but lost that year to Around the World in 80 Days. No writer or director is attached to the remake of The King and I yet, but Paramount is reportedly “hoping to bring a contemporary perspective to the project and incorporate diversity and contrasting worldviews by incorporating real history and the musical into it.”5. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY TO BE REBOOTED BY HAPPY DEATH DAY SCREENWRITER(Photo by Paramount Pictures)As of 2021, it has now been six years since the sixth film in the Paranormal Activity horror franchise (Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, Rotten at 14%) was released in 2015. Paramount Pictures has been developing a seventh Paranormal Activity film since 2019, which has included scheduling it first for March 19, 2021, and then most likely delayed by COVID-19 for next year on March 4, 2022. As of this week, we now know that the seventh film will itself be a remake and/or reimagining described as an “unexpected retooling” of the franchise. Whatever form the seventh Paranormal Activity takes (such as, for example, whether it will still be a “found footage” film), the retooling will be directed by Will Eubank, whose previous work includes 2014’s&nbsp;The Signal&nbsp;(Fresh at 60%) and last year’s&nbsp;Underwater (Rotten at 47%). Eubank will be working from a screenplay by Christopher Landon, who directed Happy Death Day (Fresh at 71%), and wrote and directed both Happy Death Day 2U (Fresh at 71%) and Freaky (Certified Fresh at 83%), all of which&nbsp;put a unique spin on various horror or science fiction tropes.6. REGINA KING TO STAR AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SHIRLEY CHISHOLM(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)In 1972,&nbsp;U.S. Representative Shirley Chisholm&nbsp;became the first African-American to be a candidate for a major party’s presidential nomination; she was recently portrayed by Uzo Aduba in the TV mini-series Mrs. America, but she also made movie news in November when Danai Gurira signed on to star in a biopic called The Fighting Shirley Chisholm. As it turns out, that’s not the only Shirley Chisholm film in the works, as&nbsp;Regina King, who recently&nbsp;won her fourth Emmy for her work in HBO’s Watchmen and her first Oscar for her role in Barry Jenkins’&nbsp;If Beale Street Could Talk, and who also recently directed the historical drama One Night in Miami (Certified Fresh at 98%), which has been in awards conversations this year, is attached to another. King is officially attached to star as Chisholm in a biopic called Shirley (not to be confused with this biopic called Shirley) to be directed by John Ridley, who has experience in the genre as director of the 2013 Jimi Hendrix biopic&nbsp;Jimi: All Is by My Side.7. ARE YOU THERE, GOD? IT’S THE ORIGINAL CASSIE FROM ANT-MAN(Photo by Ben Rothstein/©Marvel Studios)Last year marked the 50th anniversary of the first publication of the coming-of-age novel Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret by children’s literature author Judy Blume. Although there are certain details that haven’t aged particularly well, the book remains an important landmark in coming-of-age fiction, despite never being adapted as a motion picture, but that’s about to change. Abby Ryder Fortson, who was the original actress to play Scott Lang’s daughter Cassie in the first two Ant-Man movies, has been cast as the title character Margaret, and Rachel McAdams has been cast as her mother. Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret will be written and directed by Kelly Fremon Craig (The Edge of Seventeen, Certified Fresh at 94%) for Lionsgate and producer James L. Brooks. Lionsgate and Brooks reportedly won the right to adapt Judy Blume’s novel after traveling to Florida to meet with Blume in a conference room that had been transformed into an 11-year-old girl’s bedroom with “pictures of executives as 11-year olds.”8. JAMES WAN’S&nbsp;TRAIN TO BUSAN REMAKE FINDS ITS DIRECTOR(Photo by Well Go USA Entertainment)Last year’s Academy Award Best Picture win for Parasite (Certified Fresh at 98%) shone a new light on the South Korean film industry, but the country’s film output is broad and includes many genres. For example,&nbsp;the 2015 zombie movie Train to Busan (Certified Fresh at 94%) was an international hit, and it received a sequel last year called Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula (Rotten at 53%). The title tells you exactly what the movie’s hook is, as&nbsp;it centers on the passengers of a train who find themselves surrounded by a zombie apocalypse. Back in 2018, New Line Cinema announced an English-language remake of the film with James Wan on board as producer, but this week we learned that the film finally has its director in the form of Timo Tjahjanto (The Night Comes for Us, Fresh at 91%), who is&nbsp;now in talks for the job. The English-language screenplay was adapted by Gary Dauberman, who has written several films for Wan’s Conjuring Universe and&nbsp;who is also preparing to direct a remake of Stephen King’s vampire story, ‘Salem’s Lot.9. DAISY RIDLEY TO STAR IN ABDUCTION THRILLER THE MARSH KING’S DAUGHTER(Photo by Nicola Dove/©20th Century Fox Film Corporation)The world is still waiting on the sci-fi thriller Chaos Walking&nbsp;(3/5/2021) several years after Daisy Ridley&nbsp;was announced to star alongside Tom Holland, but this week, we learned about another new film for the former Star Wars franchise star. Ridley is now attached to star in the film adaptation of the psychological thriller novel The Marsh King’s Daughter by author Karen Dionne. Ridley will play a woman who was kept hostage in a remote wilderness with her mother by her father, an infamous criminal called “The Marsh King.” The Marsh King’s Daughter will be directed by Neil Burger, whose recent films have included the remake The Upside (Rotten at 42%), as well as all three films of the&nbsp;Divergent (Rotten at 41%) franchise.On an Apple device?

Director Chloé Zhao’s&nbsp;next film will be Marvel Studios’ Eternals, which has been delayed a year by COVID-19 from November, 2020 to November 5, 2021, despite actually being filmed by Zhao concurrently with Nomadland in late 2018 and early 2019. Marvel has yet to release even a single still from Eternals, so we still don’t know what that MCU movie might look like (other than that Kumail Nanjiani is ripped), but this week’s news suggests that Universal Pictures has their sights on her. Chloé Zhao is attached to write, direct, and produce Universal Pictures’ latest reboot of their classic vampire franchise Dracula, which will reportedly be adapted as a futuristic, science fiction Western (we hope Zhao remembers to include vampires). In an interesting twist, Universal Pictures is also continuing to work with Blumhouse and director Karyn Kusama on another Dracula project (in which Sebastian Stan has expressed interest in starring), so that Universal now has two separate Dracula reboots in development at the same time.Other Top Headlines1. WICKED MOVIE FINALLY HAPPENING WITH CRAZY RICH ASIANS DIRECTOR(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)A recurring theme in The Weekly Ketchup involves reminders of exactly how long it takes some movies to finally get produced. The Wicked movie definitely falls into that territory, as Univeral Pictures has been developing an adaptation of the revisionist Wizard of Oz Broadway musical&nbsp;since 2009 (predating the similarly themed Oz: The Great and Powerful&nbsp;by four years). Repeatedly over the past decade, Universal Pictures has put Wicked on their release schedule, including most recently on December 20, 2019, which obviously didn’t happen — that specific slot went to another Broadway musical adaptation, Cats, instead. The Wicked movie seemed to hit a roadbump in October when Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot, The Hours) dropped out as director, but the&nbsp;project&nbsp;is back up and active, with&nbsp;director Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, Certified Fresh at 91%) now attached. Chu also has the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical In the Heights still awaiting release on June 18, 2021 after being pushed back from its original summer, 2020 release by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;He had recently become available after dropping out of directing the Willow&nbsp;sequel series —&nbsp;which also got back into development with a new director — for Disney+.&nbsp; There is no current release date for Wicked, but it is likely to be December of either 2022 or 2023, since that’s the month Universal has previously slated Wicked for release.2. MICHELLE WILLIAMS TO CROON AS PEGGY LEE IN FEVER(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)The impact of the popularity of rock and roll in the 1950s and 1960s, from Elvis Presley to the Beatles, was so strong that it’s perhaps difficult for later generations to fully register that right before that all went down, it was still jazz, big bands, and the “Rat Pack” that dominated pop music. One such hit record from that period is jazz singer Peggy Lee’s sultry cover of “Fever” in 1958. There has been talk about a Peggy Lee biopic for a while now (including from Billie Eilish, who might executive produce with her mother), and as it turns out, the star of Fever is going to be someone who also played 1950s sex idol Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn (Certified Fresh at 83%). Michelle Williams is now attached to reunite with director Todd Haynes (for whom she starred in both I’m Not Here and Wonderstruck) as Peggy Lee in the biopic Fever, which MGM is now negotiating to distribute. Coincidentally, this news came just a week after Williams also signed to reunite with director Kelly Reichardt for a fourth film together, so this has been a busy fortnite for the Oscar-nominated actress. Fever is another movie that’s been in development for some time, dating back at least to the early 2010s when Reese Witherspoon almost starred, until the death in 2012 of director Nora Ephron.3. WILL SMITH TO PLAY IT FAST &amp; LOOSE FOR DAVID LEITCH(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)Stunt coordinator-turned-action-director David Leitch (Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde, Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw) is currently busy at work with Brad Pitt on his latest film, Bullet Train, but this week, Leitch and his representation already began studio negotiations for a project with another big movie star, Will Smith. That movie is a drama called Fast &amp; Loose, and it is now the subject of a heated bidding war between several studios, including MGM, Paramount, Sony, Warner Bros., and unspecified streamers (probably flicks on the ‘Net). You can read a more detailed premise here, but the gist is that Will Smith would play a crime lord who wakes up in Mexico with amnesia and discovers as he puts his memories back together that he had two lives — one as a powerful crime kingpin, and another as an underccover CIA agent, but without confirmation of which of those is his true identity.4. FREEDOM RIDE TO TELL TRUE STORY OF CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER JOHN LEWIS(Photo by Jeff Hutchens/Getty Images)In a sad coincidence, civil rights leader and U.S. Representative John Lewis&nbsp;died on July 17, 2020, just two weeks after the day-and-date debut of the documentary John Lewis: Good Trouble (Certified Fresh at 96%). The true story of the Freedom Riders, of whom John Lewis was one, is now going to be adapted as the drama Freedom Ride to be directed by Deon Taylor&nbsp;(Black and Blue, Meet the Blacks). Freedom Ride is set to be produced by several&nbsp;collaborators who are now seeking a distributor with hopes for filming to start sometime this summer on location in Atlanta, GA and Birmingham, AL. No announcements have been made yet about whom might be cast as Lewis or any of the leaders of the Freedom Riders movement.5. FOURTH CLOVERFIELD MOVIE NOW BEING DEVELOPED(Photo by ©Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)The Cloverfield franchise, which currently consists of three films (Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane, and The Cloverfield Paradox), is somewhat unique in that each film has been produced in relative secrecy, to the point where it was unclear they were even&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a single&nbsp;franchise until very late in their post-production. Specifically, both 10 Cloverfield Lane and The Cloverfield Paradox began their developments as standalone science fiction movies (titled The Cellar and God Particle, respectively), which were then later retooled to become part of the larger, looser Cloverfield narrative. That’s an important distinction to note, because this week’s news is actually about a new Cloverfield project being produced by J.J. Abrams&nbsp;that is being built from the ground up specifically as a Cloverfield movie (and not as something else being retrofitted to fit&nbsp;the franchise). Having said that, as with its predecessors, we don’t actually know anything else about this project, except that it will not be a found-footage movie (like the original&nbsp;Cloverfield).6. SHAZAM! STAR ZACHARY LEVI TO STAR IN HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Prior to&nbsp;2019, Zachary Levi was probably best known for starring in the NBC spy drama Chuck, but that was before he starred in the DC Comics superhero movie Shazam! (Certified Fresh at 90%). Warner Bros. is committed to producing the sequel Shazam! Fury of the Gods for release on June 2, 2023, but that isn’t expected to start filming until late 2021 at the earliest. In the meantime, Levi has signed with Sony Pictures to star in a new project&nbsp;that&nbsp;is a live action adaptation of the classic children’s book Harold and the Purple Crayon. The screenplay is currently being adapted by the writing team of David Guion and Michael Handelman, whose previous credits include Dinner for Schmucks (Rotten at 42%) and Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (Rotten at 47%). There have reportedly been several attempts in the past to adapt Harold and the Purple Crayon as a movie, including a Sony Pictures animated film and a live-action version that would’ve been directed by Spike Jonze (Her, Where the Wild Things Are).7. HOLLYWOOD JUMPS ON GAMESTOP MOVIE PROJECTS EN MASSE(Photo by Olivier Douliery/Getty Images)For context, it’s important to note right at the beginning of this story that the GameStop “short squeeze”&nbsp;happened just last week, and it was only on January 28th that Robinhood and other brokerages halted trading of GameStop stock. Since then, however, there are now at least five different feature film projects in development based on the event (three narrative, two documentaries). One of those projects is called The Antisocial Network, and MGM has already acquired the film rights to the book proposal of the same title by writer Ben Mezrich, whose book Bringing Down the House was the inspiration for the Kevin Spacey gambling movie 21 (Rotten at 36%). The second narrative project is an untitled movie being developed by Netflix, with Noah Centineo attached to star. The third narrative project comes from r/wallstreetbets founder Jaime Rogozinski, who has sold his life rights&nbsp;to Brett Ratner’s RatPac Entertainment. Finally, there are the two documentary projects (that we know about), one of which is being funded by a Kickstarter campaign, and the other of which is being produced by director Jonah Tulis of the recent video game documentary Console Wars (Fresh at 83%).8. THIS WEEK IN REMAKES: BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY’S, BUCK ROGERS, FATHER OF THE BRIDE(Photo by Everett Collection)After a couple of slow news weeks to kick off 2021, Hollywood seems like it’s back to business as usual, but since we like to keep the Ketchup to an even 10 stories, here’s a three-in-one about a handful of remakes. First off (and this one may be much bigger news as it progresses), Paramount Pictures is now in the midst of a legal battle with the estate of late writer Truman Capote over the studio’s rights to remake the classic Audrey Hepburn film, Breakfast at Tiffany’s (Certified Fresh at 89%). The original 1961 film hasn’t aged well in at least one respect, while at the same time, it also soft-pedals Holly Golightly’s profession in the novella&nbsp;upon which the film is based, both of which might be good reasons for a remake. Speaking of estates and legal issues, we now apparently have two competing Buck Rogers adaptations, one of which will be a George Clooney TV series while the other is a feature film being produced by Skydance Media in collaboration with the estate of Buck Rogers creator Philip Francis Nowlan. The last time Buck Rogers was on the big screen was all the way back in 1979, when Universal Pictures expanded the pilot episode of the Buck Rogers in the 25th Century TV series into a theatrically released motion picture. Finally, Warner Bros. has hired director Gaz Alazraki for their remake of Father of the Bride “with a Cuban American twist” following the previous versions starring both Spencer Tracy and Steve Martin.9. LIL YACHTY WANTS TO MAKE A HEIST COMEDY BASED ON UNO (YES,&nbsp;THE CARD GAME)(Photo by MediaNews Group/Boulder Daily Camera via Getty Images)There are certainly games and toys that could make for good source material for a movie, usually because there is a narrative quality to them. G.I. Joe and Transformers, for example, both came to movies after long runs as both animated TV shows and comic books. The card game&nbsp;UNO, though, not so much. Despite that, Mattel Films and rapper Lil Yachty are now collaborating on a movie adaptation indeed based on the UNO card game. The UNO movie will reportedly be a live-action heist comedy set within “the underground hip hop world of Atlanta,” with Lil Yachty expected to star. This might at least be good news for anyone who’s ever wanted to make movies based on Go Fish, Old Maid, or Crazy Eights.On an Apple device?

The latter is also now over 15 years old, so that may explain why Warner Bros. is preparing for a third movie for yet another generation to embrace. This time around, the film will be a prequel called Wonka, which will ostensibly delve deeper into the backstory of how the young Willy Wonka became a candy company impresario and met the Oompa-Loompas (though Depp’s movie did address some of that). Wonka is now scheduled for release on March 17, 2023, and the prequel will be directed by Paul King, who directed both Paddington (Certified Fresh at 97%) and its critically beloved sequel Paddington 2 (Certified Fresh at 100%). No official casting announcement has been made yet, but Warner Bros. is reportedly considering either Tom Holland (the MCU’s Spider-Man) or Timothée Chalamet (the star of Warner Bros.’ Dune reboot, due later this year). Several years ago, when the Wonka prequel first&nbsp;entered into development at Warner Bros., other actors who were reportedly being considered included Donald Glover, Ryan Gosling, and Ezra Miller (who will soon be busy starring in WB’s The Flash).Other Top Headlines1. MATT DAMON RETURNING FOR THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER(Photo by ©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Director Taika Waititi came to Thor: Ragnarok (Certified Fresh at 93%) from a career rooted in comedy (Eagle vs Shark, What We Do in the Shadows), and one of the funnier early bits in Thor: Ragnarok was the revelation that the Asgardian actor playing Loki in a stage production was none other than famous actor Matt Damon. It was something of an impressive “get” for Marvel Studios, because Damon remains one of the bigger movie stars who hasn’t yet appeared as a superhero (unlike his pal Ben Affleck, who’s played both Daredevil and Batman). This week, we learned that Damon and his family had arrived in Sydney, Australia so that he can participate in the filming of Thor: Love and Thunder (5/6/2022). It’s currently unclear whether Damon will be playing the same actor he played in Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;or someone else, but he was reportedly quoted as saying he would be in Australia for “the next few months,” which suggests a role bigger than a mere cameo. Damon joins a cast that also includes Chris Hemsworth (of course), Natalie Portman, Tessa Thompson, Jaimie Alexander, and Chris Pratt, with Christian Bale as the film’s villain Gorr the God Butcher.2. PEAKY BLINDERS MOVIE PLANNED AFTER THE SHOW’S FINAL SEASON(Photo by Netflix)Peaky Blinders is an award-winning crime drama BBC TV (and Netflix) series currently in its fifth season that is based upon a real street gang that operated in England from the 1890s to 1910. Earlier this week, the announcement was made that Peaky Blinders would end after its upcoming sixth season, but that news was followed the very next day by the story that applies here. Showrunner Steven Knight elaborated that Peaky Blinders will indeed continue past the TV series with “with a movie… That is what is going to happen.” Nothing else is known yet about what form a Peaky Blinders movie might take, and it’s also worth noting that both a ballet and a stage musical have been considered. Like many other long-running TV shows, Peaky Blinders has had a large ensemble cast that has included Cillian Murphy (as the gang’s leader), Paddy Considine, Aiden Gillen, Tom Hardy, Sam Neill, and Anya Taylor-Joy.3. R&amp;B SINGER LEDISI JOINS THREE WAY RACE TOWARDS MAHALIA JACKSON BIOPIC(Photo by Everett Collection)This August will mark the 58th anniversary of the the March on Washington and Martin Luther King Jr’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech. One of the performers that day was gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, and she was the one who called on King to “tell them about the dream” that he had told her&nbsp;about. The world is still waiting for a full Martin Luther King, Jr biopic (that Steven Spielberg may still have the rights to produce), but in the meantime, it appears that Mahalia Jackson may get one first, as&nbsp;she&nbsp;is now the subject of three separate biopics. The first project we heard about last August was a Lifetime TV movie produced by Robin Roberts; that one has already been produced, and it even has a trailer. Within 10 days, the news also broke that Queen Latifah is producing a feature film called&nbsp;Mahalia!&nbsp;with Jill Scott attached to star. That brings us, then, to this week’s news, which is that&nbsp;R&amp;B and jazz singer Ledisi has signed on to star as Mahalia Jackson&nbsp;in a third biopic project to be titled&nbsp;Remember Me: The Mahalia Jackson Story&nbsp;and directed by actress Denise Dowse in her feature film debut.&nbsp;Remember Me: The Mahalia Jackson Story&nbsp;will focus on the key Civil Rights Movement years of 1956 to 1963, with Columbus Short co-starring as Martin Luther King, Jr. It’s also unclear when that film — or the Jill Scott movie that it’s now in direct competition with — will be produced, and specifically, which project might be produced first.4. HUGH GRANT AND JOSH HARTNETT TO BOTH REUNITE WITH DIRECTOR GUY RITCHIE(Photo by Priscilla Grant, John Paul Melendez/Everett Collection)British director Guy Ritchie is managing to continue working right through the COVID-19 pandemic at basically his normal rate, but there’s an argument to be made that his latest crime thriller, Wrath of Man, is one of those films currently left in a sort of pandemic-induced limbo. That film features long-time Guy Ritchie collaborator Jason Statham, who will also be the lead in his upcoming spy thriller (currently untitled after previously being called Five Eyes) opposite American actress Aubrey Plaza, and this week, we learned that the film will feature two others actors reuniting with Ritchie.&nbsp;Josh Hartnett, who is also one of the stars of Wrath of Man, will also co-star in the spy thriller in an unknown role,&nbsp;while Hugh Grant will also co-star&nbsp;in what will be his next film working with Guy Ritchie after last year’s The Gentlemen (Certified Fresh at 75%).5. MAKERS OF&nbsp;FORTNITE&nbsp;EXPAND INTO MOVIES WITH ANIMATED GILGAMESH(Photo by Epic Games)Hollywood has obviously been adapting the tales of Greek mythology (Hercules, Jason and the Argonauts, Clash of the Titans) for decades, but many other cultural mythologies are adapted at varying levels. One such culture that is almost never adapted is ancient Babylonian mythology, but that’s about to change, and it’s coming from a surprising source. Hot off the continuing success of their online game Fortnite, the video game developer and publisher Epic Games&nbsp;is preparing to move into the realm of animated feature films using the same Unreal technology that is used both in their games and in current productions like The Mandalorian on Disney+. The first animated film to be produced as part of this new initiative will be Gilgamesh, based on the ancient Mesopotomanian Epic of Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh is being produced by animation companies in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America, but the film will also be adapted with an English language cast yet to be announced.6. JOSH DUHAMEL REPLACES ARMIE HAMMER IN J.LO ROM-COM(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)One of the most intriguing recent stories was revealed last week when we learned that Armie Hammer had dropped out of the romantic comedy Shotgun Wedding just a few weeks before filming was scheduled to start on location in the Dominican Republic. (We won’t get into the alleged details&nbsp;why.) Film productions frequently have “back-up plans” (mostly because of scheduling conflicts, such as the situation that WandaVision star Elizabeth Olsen explained in this piece), and we now have a good guess at who has also been in the running when producers were considering “an Armie Hammer type.” Las Vegas and Transforrmers franchise star Josh Duhamel is now in talks to replace Armie Hammer opposite Jennifer Lopez in the romantic comedy Shotgun Wedding. If the deal goes through, Duhamel and Lopez will play a couple who gather their friends and family for a destination wedding in the Caribbean that goes awry when the wedding party is held hostage. Lionsgate will distribute Shotgun Wedding, which will be directed by Jason Moore (Pitch Perfect, Sisters).On an Apple device?

Frank Baum are well known, one could argue that the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz left such a strong legacy that it kept the number of later Oz movies to a relative minimum, including The Wiz&nbsp;(Rotten at 42%), Return to Oz&nbsp;(Rotten at 53%), and 2013’s Oz the Great and Powerful (Rotten at 57%). With this week’s news, however, there are now three major productions in development based on or inspired by those books. Just last week, the Wicked movie (based on the stage musical prequel) received a breath of fresh air in the form of Crazy Rich Asians director Jon M. Chu, who joined the project. And then, this week, the animated adaptation of the spin-off book Toto: The Dog-Gone Amazing Story of the Wizard of Oz made its next step toward production via a new deal between Warner Bros. and the animation studio Animal Logic. As big of a deal as both Wicked and Toto might potentially be, however, the third project announced this week has the potential to be the biggest, as New Line Cinema is now developing a new adaptation of L. Frank Baum’s original novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which was the direct inspiration for the classic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. New Line has hired director Nicole Kassell (The Woodsman, Certified Fresh at 88%) to start development on the&nbsp;film, which unlike other adaptations can use elements from the 1939 movie, like the ruby slippers. Kassell also recently directed three episodes of HBO’s Watchmen.Other Top Headlines1. SANDRA BULLOCK JOINS BRAD PITT’S ACTION MOVIE&nbsp;BULLET TRAIN(Photo by ©Warner Bros.)Sandra Bullock and Brad Pitt have been two of Hollywood’s biggest stars since the 1990s, but they’ve never&nbsp;appeard together in the same movie. As of this week, that’s about to change, as Bullock has joined the ensemble cast of the action movie Bullet Train, alongside Brad Pitt, Zazie Beetz (Deadpool 2), Aaron Taylor Johnson (Avengers: Age of Ultron), Michael Shannon, Brian Tyree Henry, Joey King, Logan Lerman, and Masi Oka. David Leitch (Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw) is directing Bullet Train from a screenplay by Zak Olkewicz (in what may be his first released film) adapted from the novel Maria Beetle by Japanese author Kōtarō Isaka, which tells the story of five assassins aboard a bullet train in Japan who discover that their targets are all related. Although Pitt is expected to be one of the assassins, it’s not yet clear if Sandra Bullock is playing one, too.2. VELVET BUZZSAW ACTRESS CAST AS MYSTERIOUS CAPTAIN MARVEL 2 VILLAIN(Photo by ©Strand Releasing courtesy Everett Collection)The Marvel Cinematic Universe occasionally recruits its villains from relative comic book obscurity. In addition to major villains like Thanos, Dormammu, Hela, The Red Skull, and Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 gave us Ayesha, and the various Black Order villains in Avengers: Infinity War weren’t even introduced in the comics until as recently as 2013. So, when an MCU villain is cast, but Marvel doesn’t say who&nbsp;it is, we’re left wondering if it’s someone iconic or someone even diehard comics fans might need to look up on a wiki site. That leads us to the news today that Velvet Buzzsaw co-star Zawe Ashton has been cast as the main villain in Captain Marvel 2 (keeping in mind, of course, that Marvel movies frequently have more than one villain). Ashton is joining a cast that already includes Brie Larson (obviously), Teyonah Parris (Monica Rambeau from WandaVision), and Iman Vellani (Kamala Khan from the upcoming Disney+ series Ms. Marvel). Captain Marvel 2 will be directed by Nia DaCosta, whose highly anticipated sequel&nbsp;Candyman&nbsp;(8/27/2021) is due out this year after a delay prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;Marvel Studios currently has scheduled Captain Marvel 2 for release on November 11, 2022.3.&nbsp;JACK BLACK WILL VOICE CLAPTRAP IN THE BORDERLANDS MOVIE(Photo by Hopper Stone/©Columbia Pictures)The Borderlands video game franchise is built around several characters who represent standard gaming tropes, but probably the most popular character in the games is the comedic robot NPC (non-player character) Claptrap. The first time we ever heard about casting for the Borderlands movie was in May of 2020, when Cate Blanchett started negotiations to play Lilith, the Siren, which established that the Borderlands movie is aiming for A-list stars. That was a trend we saw continue two weeks ago when Kevin Hart also joined the project as Roland, the Soldier. The third cast member to be announced was Jamie Lee Curtis (who also has two more Halloween movies coming in 2021 and 2022), who will play the scientist Dr. Tannis,&nbsp;another NPC in the games. That news was followed this week by the news that Jack Black will provide the voice of Claptrap, meaning that both characters cast this week aren’t any of the games’ playable characters. Like Blanchett, Jack Black previously worked with director Eli Roth on the kids movie The House with a Clock in its Walls (Fresh at&nbsp; 65%), and more recently, he co-starred alongside Hart in the sequel&nbsp;Jumanji: The Next Level.4. WATCHMEN SCREENWRITER TO ADAPT MARVEL’S BLADE&nbsp;STARRING MAHERSHALA ALI(Photo by ©New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)One of the most surprising announcements at Marvel Studios’ San Diego Comic-Con presentation in 2019 was the news that the vampire hunter Blade would be rebooted for the MCU with two-time Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali attached to take over the role. This week,&nbsp;Blade&nbsp;took its next step&nbsp;forward&nbsp;by hiring screenwriter Stacy Osei-Kuffour, who previously worked on the HBO Max superhero show Watchmen. Blade does not yet have a director or a release date, but Kevin Feige confirmed in 2019 that&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be part of Marvel’s Phase 5 (we’re currently in Phase 4). According to The Hollywood Reporter, the title of the&nbsp;film&nbsp;will be Blade the Vampire Slayer (not to be confused with Buffy the Vampire Slayer). In somewhat related news, Hong Chau, who co-starred in Watchmen as the (borderline) antagonist Lady Trieu, has joined Brendan Fraser in The Whale, the next film from director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Black Swan), about a man who weighs over 600 pounds.5. ELISABETH MOSS JOINS MOVIE ABOUT THE MAKING OF THE GODFATHER(Photo by Mark Rogers/©Universal Pictures)One of the projects that Armie Hammer’s dropped out of following his recent downfall was the Paramount+ series The Offer, about the behind-the-scenes drama behind the making of The Godfather (Certified Fresh at 98%). The true story of the making of The Godfather was to be both a series and a feature film, and Oscar Isaac and Jake Gyllenhaal have both been attached to star in the untitled feature film for a while now, as director Francis Ford Coppola and Paramount executive Robert Evans, respectively. This week, the film gained its third cast member, as Elisabeth Moss has joined the untitled project as Francis Ford Coppola’s wife, Eleanor Coppola, who later went on to have her own directorial career. Whatever it ends up being titled, this making-of-The-Godfather feature film will be directed by Barry Levinson, whose recent films The Wizard of Lies, and Paterno were also based on true stories.6. MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ JOINS DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS(Photo by Giles Keyte/©Universal Pictures)Last year marked the 20th anniversary of the first live-action Dungeons &amp; Dragons (Rotten at 10%), and about the fifth anniversary of the start of development on a new reboot of the franchise (not counting the two direct-to-video sequels to the 2000 version). In 2017, Dungeons &amp; Dragons moved from Warner Bros. to Paramount Pictures, where the latter’s Star Trek star Chris Pine signed on in December. This week, Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;signed&nbsp;two more stars, both of whom have had their biggest box office successes with Universal Pictures franchises. Fast and the Furious star Michelle Rodriguez and Justice Smith (Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Detective Pikachu) have both signed on to co-star&nbsp;in Paramount’s reboot of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, based on the popular role-playing game franchise. As with Chris Pine, the specifics about what sorts of characters they will play hasn’t been announced yet. Dungeons &amp; Dragons (5/27/2022) will be directed for Paramount Pictures by the team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who previously directed the Vacation reboot (Rotten at 27%) in 2015 and the much better received 2018 comedy Game Night (Certified Fresh at 85%).7. ADAM WINGARD WILL DIRECT A REBOOT/SEQUEL OF&nbsp;FACE/OFF(Photo by ©Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)It feels like decades now that Hollywood has been obsessed with rebooting, remaking, and reimagining the movies of the 1980s, but slowly, gradually, the focus is turning to the much-maligned decade of the 1990s. If one movie is an iconic example of&nbsp;the 1990s action movie, there’s a strong argument to be made for director John Woo’s 1997 film Face/Off (Certified Fresh at 92%), starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta as two men on opposite sides of the law who literally exchange faces. Director Adam Wingard (The Guest, Blair Witch, Death Note) most recently directed the upcoming monster movie Godzilla vs Kong (3/31/2021), so he’s currently looking towards future projects, and one of them will be a reboot of the Face/Off franchise&nbsp;that will take the form of a sequel to the original film with a new cast. Of course, if any movie lends itself to being both remade and sequelized at the same time, it’s Face/Off, since the premise basically negates any continuity issues.8. RUMOR CONTROL: SUPERMAN WON’T BE IN SHAZAM! FURY OF THE GODS AFTER ALL(Photo by Clay Enos/©Warner Bros.)After the DC Comics movie Shazam! (Certified Fresh at 90%) ended with a comedy beat featuring a body double as Superman, fans were probably not at all surprised by online speculation and rumors that Henry Cavill would be co-starring as&nbsp;the Man of Steel in the sequel Shazam! Fury of the Gods (6/2/2023). Well, Variety debunked that rumor this week, as the trade publication has confirmed that Henry Cavill will not be joining Zachary Levi and Asher Angel in Shazam! Fury of the Gods as Superman. Shazam! director David F. Sandberg also Tweeted recently that “halfway through shooting Shazam the plan was still for Cavill to be in it. Scoopers could have scooped that and been right at the time but wrong in the end.”9. ANIMATION STUDIO BEHIND ICE AGE, RIO, AND THE PEANUTS MOVIE TO SHUT DOWN(Photo by ©20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Walt Disney Pictures was already a massive hive of competing subsidiaries (including both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios) before the 2019 finalization of the acquisition of the various Fox TV and film properties. So, this week’s news is not particularly surprising, but it is still always sad to hear about the shutdown of a major employer, and for over 20 years, Blue Sky Studios&nbsp;was exactly that, with nearly 450 employees. Blue Sky released 13 animated feature films, including Ice Age and its four sequels, Rio (and Rio 2), Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who, The Peanuts Movie, and most recently and finally, Spies in Disguise. Specifically, the reason for Blue Sky shutting down is the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the Blue Sky library is still part of Disney, as are their intellectual properties, one project which will be canned is the animated adaptation of the Nimona webcomic by creator Noelle Stevenson, whose Lumberjanes was also at one point in development at 20th Century Fox as an animated feature. Nimona has previously been scheduled for release on January 14, 2022, and when it was cancelled, the film still had 10 months of production left.On an Apple device?

That said, it now looks like he’s ready to tackle his past&nbsp;a little more directly, as&nbsp;he has co-written a screenplay&nbsp;loosely based on&nbsp;his own childhood and coming of age as a Jewish teenager and movie buff living in Arizona in the 1950s and 1960s. Spielberg is reportedly working on the project simultaneously while he puts the finishing touches on his remake of West Side Story (12/10/2021); filming of the new drama, which he will also direct, is expected to start as soon as July of this summer, aiming for a release in 2022. Spielberg has, in fact, already cast Michelle Williams to play the mother, and is currently doing test screenings with young actors to play the young protagonist based on him and fill out the ensemble cast of supporting characters. Spielberg’s writing partner on the project was Tony Kushner, with whom Spielberg has frequently collaborated, including on both Munich and Lincoln.Other Top Headlines1. EMMA STONE AND WILLEM DAFOE MIGHT BE POOR THINGS(Photo by Jef Hernandez, JA/Everett Collection)In 2018, Emma Stone received her third Academy Award nomination for The Favourite (Certified Fresh at 93%), and now she’s in talks to reunite with that film’s director, Yorgos Lanthimos. Willem Dafoe is also in talks to co-star&nbsp;in Poor Things, which will be an adaptation of the 1992 novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray. Screenwriter Tony McNamara, who also co-wrote The Favourite and Emma Stone’s upcoming 101 Dalmatians spin-off Cruella, is adapting Gray’s novel, which uses an “unreliable narrator” device to tell its Frankenstein-style story of a Victorian woman brought back to life by an eccentric scientist (Searchlight Pictures has not yet confirmed whether that’s the role Willem Dafoe is in talks for). Dafoe currently has four movies awaiting release, all from acclaimed directors: Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch, Guillermo del Toro’s Nightmare Alley, Paul Schrader’s The Card Counter, and Robert Eggers’&nbsp;The Northman.2. MICHAEL B. JORDAN TO MAKE DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH NEXT CREED(Photo by Barry Wetcher/©MGM)Although the first Rocky was directed by John G. Avildsen, Sylvester Stallone went on to direct Rocky II (Fresh at 71%), Rocky III (Fresh at 63%), Rocky IV (Rotten at 40%), and Rocky Balboa (Certified Fresh at 77%), as well as write and star in all four of those films. Michael B. Jordan effectively took over as the star of the franchise starting with Creed (Certified Fresh at 95%) and continuing with&nbsp;Creed II (Certified Fresh at 83%), and now, he’s going to follow in Stallone’s footsteps as director as well. Michael B. Jordan is now committed to make his directorial debut&nbsp;with Creed III, in which he will also star. No premise has been announced for the boxing sequel yet, but MGM has already scheduled Creed III for release on Thanksgiving Day, 2022 (11/24/2022). In related news this week, Jordan’s Creed II opponent, Florian Munteanu, signed&nbsp;to co-star in the video game adaptation Borderlands as “Krieg,” alongside Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Jamie Lee Curtis, Cate Blanchett, and Haley Bennett, who will be playing a new character.3.&nbsp;ELIZABETH BANKS TO DIRECT THE TRUE STORY OF THE&nbsp;COCAINE BEAR(Photo by Saeed Adyani/©Netflix)“That stuff only happens in the movies” is a common catchphrase for distinguishing between reality and fantastic reaches in fiction, but every once in a while, a true story really is outlandish on that scale. In 1985, the&nbsp;New York Times first reported&nbsp;that a 175-lb. brown bear was found dead in Georgia after apparently consuming 40 packets of cocaine that were eventually connected to a Kentucky smuggler who had jumped out of an airplane, D.B. Cooper-style. It’s now time for Cocaine Bear to finally get his story told on the big screen, as Elizabeth Banks is now attached to make it her next project as director&nbsp;after Pitch Perfect II (Fresh at 65%) and 2019’s Charlie’s Angels&nbsp;(Rotten at 52%). Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the team behind The LEGO Movie, will produce Cocaine Bear for Universal Pictures. Filming of Cocaine Bear is expected to start this summer, but no casting has been announced yet. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Banks is also still developing The Magic School Bus movie, in which she will also star as Ms. Frizzle.4. SONY PICTURES ANIMATION WILL GIVE US&nbsp;K-POP: DEMON HUNTERS(Photo by The Chosunilbo JNS/Getty Images)Sony Pictures Animation has been steadily producing animated movies since Open Season in 2006, including hits like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (Certified Fresh at 86%) and the various Hotel Transylvania movies, but none of them probably prepared fans for the visual spectacle of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (Certified Fresh at 97%), which eventually won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Sony Pictures is currently working on a Spider-Verse sequel, but another new project announced this week is K-Pop: Demon Hunters, whose premise is pretty much laid out directly by its title. K-Pop: Demon Hunters will tell the story of a world famous Korean all-girl pop group who also have secret identities as demon hunters. Sony has not yet announced which K-Pop stars might star in&nbsp;the film, which will be directed Chris Appelhans (Sony’s upcoming Wish Dragon) and Maggie Kang, who will be making her directorial debut after working as an artist&nbsp;on movies like Trolls, Puss in Boots, and The Croods: A New Age.5. THE CROWN’S&nbsp;EMMA CORRIN TO&nbsp;STAR IN&nbsp;LADY CHATTERLEY’S LOVER(Photo by Des Willie/©Netflix)The cast of Netflix’s The Crown switches every two seasons, so most of the cast was the same in last year’s fourth season as in the third season (that’s the group including Olivia Colman and Helena Bonham Carter). There were, however, two major historical figures that joined the show last year, and they were Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher and relative newcomer Emma Corrin as Princess Diana. In just one year, The Crown has quickly elevated Corrin’s celebrity status, including a Golden Globe win last month, and now&nbsp;SHE is attached to star in a new adaptation of a literary classic. Emma Corrin will star as the title character in Lady Chatterley’s Lover, based on the novel by D.H. Lawrence. There have been several adaptations of the book, including the 1955 film starring Daielle Darrieux, which led to a groundbreaking 1959 Supreme Court ruling about obscenity laws. This latest adaptation of Lady Chatterley’s Lover will be directed by Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre, whose most recent film was The Mustang (Certified Fresh at 95%). Like the rest of the current cast, Emma Corrin will not be returning for season 5 of The Crown, as&nbsp;Elizabeth Debicki is already set to play&nbsp;the older Princess Diana.6. ELLE FANNING TO PORTRAY LOVE STORY STAR ALI MACGRAW(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)The late 1960s and early 1970s were a period of drastic generational change in Hollywood that has been extremely well documented in book form (your local library probably has a whole section devoted to “New Hollywood”), but there have been surprisingly fewer movies about that period (though Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood was one recent example). Director Barry Levinson&nbsp;(Diner, Avalon, Rain Man) is preparing a project called Francis and the Godfather, which will depict the making of The Godfather, with Oscar Isaac starring as Francis Ford Coppola and Jake Gyllenhaal as producer Robert Evans. During this period, Robert Evans was married to Ali MacGraw, who starred in Love Story (Fresh at 68%), one of Evans’ first and biggest box office hits at Paramount. Elle Fanning has landed the role of Ali MacGraw in Francis and the Godfather. In the early 1970s, Ali MacGraw was also romantically involved with movie star Steve McQueen, so we might expect that his role will also be cast soon.7. VIGGO MORTENSEN, COLIN FARRELL, JOEL EDGERTON TO STAR IN RON HOWARD’S THAI CAVE RESCUE DRAMA(Photo by Priscilla Grant, James Atoa, Jason Smith/Everett Collection)It doesn’t happen all the time, but a fairly common trend in film development involves “dueling movies,” which is what happens when two or more projects about a similar subject compete with each other to get released first, whether it be movies about volcanoes, Snow White, Robin Hood, athlete Steve Prefontaine, or most recently, the GameStop stock controversy. In that vein, the last two years&nbsp;have seen six different movie projects gearing up to depict the true story of the 2018 Thai cave rescue of a junior football team trapped in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave there, but it is looking like the winner might be director Ron Howard (Willow, Parenthood, Apollo 13),&nbsp;who directed last year’s Hillbilly Elegy (Rotten at 25%). Howard’s project is now titled Thirteen Lives, and its ensemble cast will be led by Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, and Joel Edgerton. Ron Howard is planning to film Thirteen Lives both in Australia and on location in Thailand.8. KENNETH BRANAGH TO DIRECT THE BEE GEES BIOPIC(Photo by ©ShortsHD courtesy Everett Collection)It was exactly three months ago that the documentary The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart (Certified Fresh at 96%) debuted on HBO and HBO Max, which was about a year after we first heard about Paramount Pictures planning a Bee Gees biopic. The project is definitely still on, as this week, the studio hired Kenneth Branagh (Thor, Hamlet, Henry V) to direct the film. Branagh is currently finishing up his remake of Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile (9/17/2021) after also directing and starring in Murder on the Orient Express&nbsp;(Fresh at 60%). The project, which doesn’t yet have a title, is currently being written by British TV writer Ben Elton, who also recently adapted Branagh’s Shakespeare drama All is True (Fresh at 71%). Paramount Pictures has not yet announced any casting for the four Brothers Gibb, but one has to figure the actors will probably be either Australian or British (the Gibb brothers were born in England but grew up in Australia before moving back to England again).9. TREVOR NOAH TO REMAKE THE RELATIVELY OBSCURE THE PRESIDENT’S ANALYST(Photo by CBS Photo Archive/Getty Images)There are many different perspectives on what sorts of movies should ever be remade or rebooted. One argument is that rather than remaking extremely famous movies, there is more of an upside to remaking films that are relatively forgotten now, since there are fewer fans to be upset by the latest version. This writer has a feeling Daily Show&nbsp;host Trevor Noah subscribes to that philosophy, because for one of his first major feature film projects (in addition to a separate project based on his own life), Trevor Noah has picked the 1967 James Coburn film The Presient’s Analyst (Fresh at 77%). Noah is producing the remake for Paramount Pictures with the option of possibly also starring. Noah and Paramount have hired Pat Cunnane, who served as Deputy Director of Messaging for Present Barack Obama, to adapt the remake’s screenplay, which undoubtedly will need to be heavily updated to reflect the changes in national politics since 1967.On an Apple device?

Jordan will produce Static Shock.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 23, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles like Fast and Furious,&nbsp;Static Shock, and Battlestar Galactica.This WEEK’S TOP STORYFAST AND FURIOUS FRANCHISE TO END AFTER THREE MORE MOVIES(Photo by Universal/Everett Collection)In the original gameplan, F9 was to have been released back on May 22, 2020 and Fast &amp; Furious 10 would’ve been coming out next summer, probably in the 5/28/2021 spot where F9 is now scheduled. Universal Pictures confirmed this week that the main Fast and the Furious franchise will wrap up with F11. F9&nbsp;director&nbsp;Justin Lin will also return&nbsp;to direct&nbsp;F10 and F11, with the expectation of bring back&nbsp;Vin Diesel,&nbsp;Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel, and Sung Kang. (Sorry, Gal Gadot fans.) It’s also worth noting that this is just the core franchise we’re talking about here, as plans for a Hobbs &amp; Shaw sequel starring Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are still in development.Other Top Headlines1. MICHAEL B. JORDAN PRODUCING DC COMICS SUPERHERO MOVIE STATIC SHOCK(Photo by Warner Bros. Animation/Everett Collection)Warner Bros announced at their DC Fandome virtual event in August&nbsp;that there were plans for a feature film adaptation of Static Shock, which was sort of their flagship title in the 1990s for their Milestone Media division before also being adapted in the early 2000s as a Kids WB animated series. This week, the Static Shock movie received a high profile partner in Michael B. Jordan,&nbsp;who&nbsp;joins the project as producer through his Outlier Society production company.&nbsp;2. CANADIAN NEWCOMER LANDS TIGER LILY ROLE IN PETER PAN &amp; WENDY&nbsp;&nbsp;(Photo by Disney/Everett Collection)When Warner Bros and director Joe Wright made&nbsp;Pan in 2015, one of the movie’s biggest controversies revolved around the decision to cast Rooney Mara as the Native American princess Tiger Lily. (Mara later expressed regret over taking the job.&nbsp;For their own live-action adaptation of&nbsp;Peter Pan, called Peter Pan &amp; Wendy, Walt Disney Pictures is avoiding that sort of PR disaster by casting Canadian newcomer Alyssa Wapanatâhk, who is of Cree heritage,&nbsp; as Tiger Lily. The role has also reportedly been “reimagined” from how author and playwright J.M. Barrie originally depicted the character. Wapanatâhk is joining a live action cast which already includes Jude Law as Captain Hook, Yara Shahidi (black-ish) as Tinker Bell, and two other relative newcomers: Alexander Molony&nbsp;as Peter, and Ever Anderson as Wendy.&nbsp;3. WENDELL PIERCE TO TAKE CENTER STAGE IN B.B. KING BIOPIC(Photo by Paramount/Everett Collection)Trends come and go in Hollywood, but one that is definitely surging right now is the musician biopic, partly because of the box office successes of Bohemian Rhapsody&nbsp;and Rocketman. Biopics in the pipeline as of this week include Respect (Aretha Franklin), Elvis (Presley), I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Whitney Houston), and untitled projects about Madonna and Sammy Davis, Jr. To this list, we can add famed blues guitarist B.B. King (1925-2015), as actor Wendell Pierce revealed online this week&nbsp;that he will star as King in a biopic called The Thrill Is On. Pierce is perhaps best known for his role as Bunk Moreland on HBO’s The Wire. On Twitter, Pierce noted that he “will honor&nbsp;[King] and his creative genius.” No director for The Thrill is Gone has been announced yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;4. REESE WITHERSPOON CASTS HER ADAPTATION OF BESTSELLER WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING(Photo by Hulu/Everett Collection)Debut novelist Delia Owens had&nbsp;a huge surprise best selling hit&nbsp;in 2019 with the novel&nbsp;Where the Crawdads Sing, about a young mid-centur girl growing up alone in the marshlands of rural North Carolina who finds herself the focus of a scandal. Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine production company partnered with Sony Pictures earlier this year to produce a&nbsp;Where the Crawdads Sing movie, and this week the lead role has gone to&nbsp;&nbsp;22-year-old British actress Daisy Edgar-Jones.&nbsp;She&nbsp;has mostly worked in English and Irish film and TV projects like Cold Feet and Normal People. The&nbsp;Crawdads adaptation&nbsp;will be directed by Olivia Newman (First Match)&nbsp;from a screenplay by Lucy Alibar (Troop Zero).5. THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD MIGHT’VE JUST GOTTEN A LOT LONGER FOR WICKED(Photo by Everett Collection)The Broadway musical adaptation&nbsp;of the novel Wicked&nbsp;debuted seventeen years ago, and Universal Pictures has been developing a movie version since 2012 (including a period in which the film was scheduled for release in the December 2019 spot that eventually went to Cats). The production plans that would’ve led to that 2019 release were eventually scrapped, and Universal rescheduled Wicked instead for two years later on December 22, 2021. The Wicked movie now&nbsp;hits another serious bump on the Yellow Brick Road as director Stephen Daldry&nbsp;has left the production. Although Universal is now faced with replacing Daldry during the COVID-19 pandemic, his departure was reportedly over scheduling, with Universal wanting Wicked sooner than Daldry was “comfortable moving” (and also due to a lack of stage space in London where Daldry wanted to film). Universal reportedly hopes to start filming Wicked with a new director by late 2021. There is currently no new release date, but Universal’s pattern for Wicked seems to suggest it will be a December in whatever year they eventually choose, which now looks like 2022 or 2023. According to Deadline, possible Wicked directors could include J.J. Abrams, James Mangold, Rob Marshall, Ryan Murphy, and Steven Spielberg.6. LONG-TIME X-MEN PRODUCER TAKING THE HELM ON BATTLESTAR GALACTICA REBOOT&nbsp;&nbsp;(Photo by Unviersal Television/Everett Collection)An entire book could be written about the many twists and turns that the Battlestar Galactica franchise&nbsp;has taken since showrunner Glen A. Larson came up with the idea as Adam’s Ark in the 1960s. In addition to the original 1978-1979 TV show, there was also a 1978 re-edit movie version&nbsp;released in theaters using “Sensurround,” the Galactica 1980 spinoff series, the critically acclaimed 2004-2009 reboot series, and various other attempts at a reboot movie, including projects from original series star Richard Hatch&nbsp;and X-Men director Bryan Singer. As it turns out, Universal’s plans for more&nbsp;Battlestar Galactica may indeed involve one of the people behind the X-Men movies: Simon Kinberg (franchise writer and&nbsp;Dark Phoenix&nbsp;director), who has signed to write and produce&nbsp;the BS&nbsp;reboot movie. A separate reboot TV show is also in development.7. HARRISON FORD AND ED HELMS TO COSTAR IN BURT SQUIRE SHIPWRECK COMEDY&nbsp;&nbsp;(Photo by Disney/Everett Collection)The COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything about the movie business, including production, but people are finding workarounds. A frequent approach appears to be filming outside the United States, especially in remote places where crews can more easily be quarantined and self-contained.&nbsp;The Isle of Man is a relatively small (221 square miles) bit of land in the Irish Sea, and it’s where a new comedy will soon be filmed. Harrison Ford and Ed Helms&nbsp;are signed to star in the shipwreck comedy The Miserable Adventures of Burt Squire Aboard the Horn High Yo, reportedly based on a true story about a man (Helms) “in the midst of a midlife crisis who embarks on what he hopes would be a dream sailing vacation, but ends up shipwrecked in the Atlantic Ocean with a charming but unhinged sea captain.” That would be Ford’s character. STX Films hasn’t announced a director yet.8. DIRECTOR OF NETFLIX’S REBECCA SETTING SAIL FOR GIANT SHARK SEQUEL THE MEG&nbsp;2(Photo by WB/Everett Collection)Some directors stay consistently within their own niche film to film, but others will occasionally go in a completely surprising direction. For example, British director Ben Wheatley&nbsp;has delivered within a modest range of thrillers or suspenseful dramas, including Netflix’s recent remake of Rebecca. A movie that would not seem 100% obvious for Wheatley to direct next would be the sequel to the 2018 giant shark action movie The Meg.&nbsp;Now Wheatley has signed on for exactly that. Jason Statham starred in the first film, and is expected to return.9. POWER RANGERS TO BE REBOOTED (AGAIN) WITH A SHARED TV/FILM CINEMATIC UNIVERSE(Photo by Lionsgate/Everett Collection)It was just three years ago that Lionsgate released their ambitious Power Rangers reboot, which earned just $142 million worldwide from a budget of over $105 million. One might argue that the low box office was a sign that the moviegoing audience, but Paramount Pictures (taking over from Lionsgate) is moving forward with plans&nbsp;for a new Power Rangers cinematic universe with stories set both in feature films and new TV shows. Paramount, eOne, and Hasbro have enlisted Jonathan Entwistle (The End of the F***ing World, I Am Not Okay With This) to shepherd all&nbsp;of the potential Power Rangers projects in both film and TV. None of the actors and actresses in the recent 2017 reboot (including Elizabeth Banks) are expected to be involved with Paramount’s projects.On an Apple device?

Fantastic Beasts 3 actually started filming in the U.K. in September, and was to have continued filming until February, but the role will now be recast with a different actor, and all of the scenes that Depp filmed will be reshot with his replacement. The news came from both Warner Bros. (in a statement that read “Johnny Depp will depart the Fantastic Beasts franchise”) and from Depp himself, who posted an image of a typed letter on his official Instagram account. This delay in filming also led today to Warner Bros. rescheduling the Fantastic Beasts 3 release date from November 12, 2021 to sometime in the summer of 2022 (though that may have been an inevitable delay because of the COVID-19 pandemic anyway). Both The Wrap&nbsp;and Collider&nbsp;posted speculative lists today of stars who could possibly replace Johnny Depp as Grindelwald, with only Colin Farrell and Tilda Swinton appearing in both articles.Other Top Headlines1. DOCTOR STRANGE DIRECTOR ANSWERS SPOOKY BLACK PHONE(Photo by Andrew Schwartz/©Screen Gems)Marvel Studios distinguished Doctor Strange from its other previous superhero movies by hiring horror director Scott Derrickson (Sinister, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) — incidentally, his replacement on the sequel, Sam Raimi, also has roots in horror. Earlier this year, we learned that Scott Derrickson is expected to direct the long-in-development thriller Bermuda (about the Bermuda Triangle), but that project hasn’t started filming yet. Another new project that Scott Derrickson is now attached to direct&nbsp;is Black Phone for Blumhouse Productions and Universal Pictures. Black Phone will be an adaptation of a horror novella by Joe Hill (A.K.A. Stephen King’s son), which is reportedly about “a dead cinephile, a lonely kid, an eight-foot-tall locust and a man locked in a basement stained with the blood of murdered children.” Blumhouse has already started casting Black Phone, starting with Mason Thames (For All Mankind) and 11-year-old child actor Madeleine McGraw (A Christmas Wish, Toy Story 4).2. ZAC EFRON TO BE STUCK IN THE AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK FOR GOLD(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Over the last several years, survival thrillers like&nbsp;All is Lost (Robert Redford), 127 Hours (James Franco), The Shallows (Blake Lively), and Adrift (Shailene Woodley and an unconscious Sam Claflin) have pitted their lead characters against nature and the elements. Zac Efron&nbsp;will soon join the&nbsp;club as he is signed to star in a survival thriller called Gold. Efron will play one of two men who find a huge chunk of gold in the Australian Outback, which leads to Efron’s character waiting by the find while the other man leaves to get the equipment necessary to actually plunder the loot, even as he (Efron) has to deal with “desert elements, ravenous wild dogs and mysterious intruders, [and] the sinking suspicion that he has been left to die out there alone.” Australian filmmaker Anthony Hayes (Animal Kingdom, Certified Fresh at 94%) co-wrote Gold, which he will direct, and in which he will also co-star (it’s unclear which role he will be playing). Other roles that Zac Efron has in the works include remakes of both Stephen King’s Firestarter&nbsp;and Three Men and a Baby (for Disney+).3. TOM HARDY TO LEAD VIETNAM WAR ENSEMBLE CAST OF THE THINGS THEY CARRIED(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)The Things They Carried is the title&nbsp;of a 1990 collection of short stories by novelist Tim O’Brien&nbsp;that all revolve around the same platoon of soldiers during the Vietnam War, one of which was adapted in 1998 as the Kiefer Sutherland film A Soldier’s Sweetheart. Director Rupert Sanders (Snow White and the Huntsman, Ghost in the Shell) is getting ready to start filming a new movie based on The Things They Carried that&nbsp;will apparently adapt several of the book’s stories. We can sort of guess that&nbsp;the end result will be more of an anthology film based on the ensemble cast that was announced this week, which includes Tom Hardy (who’s also producing), Tye Sheridan, Pete Davidson, Bill Skarsgård, Moises Arias, Angus Cloud, Stephan James, and Martin Sensmeier. Hardy will likely next be seen in the Marvel sequel Venom: Let There Be Carnage (6/25/2021), which will introduce Woody Harrelson as the titular symbiote serial killer Carnage.4. FROZEN CO-STARS TO REUNITE FOR ANOTHER (LIVE-ACTION) MUSICAL(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)Unless you’re a Broadway fan, Jonathan Groff&nbsp;might be one of the biggest movie stars of recent years whose face isn’t actually recognizable by many fans, because his biggest role was as the voices of Kristoff and Sven in Frozen (Certified Fresh at 90%) and Frozen II (Certified Fresh at 77%), which together have earned over $2.73 billion dollars worldwide. Groff may be closer to raising his visual profile with the news this week&nbsp;that he will reunite with his Frozen co-star Kristen Bell for another musical, which this time will be live action. Bell and Groff will co-star in Molly and the Moon, written by the creators of the hit CBS sitcom&nbsp;How I Met Your Mother, playing an expectant couple who sing songs to their unborn baby, with the movie then taking us inside the mom’s womb (one has to wonder if this part will also be entirely live action) where a little girl in a rowboat sings back at them. The screenwriters were reportedly inspired&nbsp;by a real-life experience with a child born with a rare genetic condition that required post-natal surgery (we don’t know yet if that part is a spoiler for Molly and the Moon).5. STEVE COOGAN TO STAR IN WACKY COMEDY ABOUT THE BONES OF KING RICHARD III(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)One of the most amazing relatively recent stories for fans and followers of British royalty came in 2012 when the skeletal remains of King Richard III (1452-1485) were discovered under an English parking lot, answering many long-lingering theories about Richard III’s physical condition during his life and the circumstances of his death. Actor Steve Coogan (The Trip, Philomena) is now signed to reunite&nbsp;with his Philomena director Stephen Frears&nbsp;for a comedy/drama called The Lost King, which will tell the true story of historian Philippa Langley, who helped discover King Richard III’s remains. Coogan will play Langley’s husband, but the actress who will play her hasn’t been cast or announced yet.6. PIERCE BROSNAN AND HELENA BONHAM CARTER IN A ROMCOM? NOT BLOODY LIKELY(Photo by Steve Mack, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Almost certainly because of Election Day (or Election Week, as it were), this was actually sort of a slow week for movie news out of Hollywood proper, but England made up for it. One of the projects announced across the pond is Not Bloody Likely, which is described as a romantic comedy (though not necessarily a traditional “rom-com”) set during the original 1914 stage production&nbsp;of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion. If you’re not familiar with that title (or the 1938 movie starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller), you might know the 1964 remake My Fair Lady (starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison), or maybe one of the loose remakes like She’s All That. Pierce Brosnan will star in Not Bloody Likely as George Bernard Shaw opposite Helena Bonham Carter, who will play an actress that Shaw is determined to cast in the play, but partly just as a ploy to rekindle their past romance. Helena Bonham Carter will soon be seen reprising her role as Princess Margaret in Season 4 of Netflix’s The Crown.7. COLIN FIRTH WILL STAR IN A ZOMBIE COMEDY(Photo by Giles Keyte/©Universal Pictures)We may have already gotten to the point of a zombie movie potentially having anybody as its star with Warm Bodies (Nicholas Hoult), The Dead Don’t Die (Adam Driver, Bill Murray), and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies&nbsp;(where does one even start), but if those films all form some sort of “arthouse zombie” subgenre, well, we got news of another&nbsp;entry&nbsp;this week. Academy Award winner Colin Firth has signed to star in the tentatively titled zombie movie New York Will Eat You Alive, which will be an adaptation of the Chinese digital comic Zombie Brother. New York Will Eat You Alive will be directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson (Isn’t It Romantic, Fresh at 70%), and one of the producers will be Channing Tatum, though it’s not yet known if Tatum will also take a role in the film. The exact nature of Firth’s role isn’t clear, but it will reportedly be a chance for him to show off his “deadpan” humor (get it, because it’s a zombie movie, and… right, moving along).8. ELLEN PAGE TO STAR IN ESPORTS MOVIE 1UP(Photo by James Atoa/Everett Collection)Hollywood is still slowly working on improving its critical relationship with video game movies, but things have started to get better recently with movies&nbsp;like this year’s&nbsp;Sonic the Hedgehog (Fresh at 63%). One of the reasons Hollywood is compelled to keep trying&nbsp;is that video games&nbsp;continue to be a major pop culture phenomenon (with many younger fans never knowing a time when they weren’t). Recently,&nbsp;eSports&nbsp;has grown in popularity —&nbsp;for the unfamiliar, the term refers to organized competitive gaming similar professional sports, including leagues, huge arenas filled with spectators, sponsorship deals, and celebrity players. As big of a deal as eSports has become, it hasn’t been the center of a major Hollywood film yet, but that will soon change. Ellen Page&nbsp;and Paris Berelc are now signed to star&nbsp;in 1UP, an “underdog comedy” set in the world of competitive eSports. 1UP will be directed by Kyle Newman (Fanboys, Rotten at 32%) for BuzzFeed Studios as part of that company’s new efforts to expand into film production. Paris Berelc will play a gamer who quits her college eSports team over the sexism of her male teammates, and Ellen Page will play the coach of her new all-women’s team (who’s dealing with her own recent experience with a GamerGate-style scandal).On an Apple device?

Back in March, we first heard that Miller was considering casting Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch, Emma.) as the younger Furiosa, and this week, that casting was confirmed. In addition to Taylor-Joy (who played Magik in The New Mutants), however, Miller has also cast Australian star Chris Hemsworth (Marvel’s Thor, obviously) and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who played both Black Manta in Aquaman and Doctor Manhattan in HBO’s Watchmen (our apologies if that’s a spoiler for a show that aired a year ago). Hemsworth will reportedly play a character called Dementus who has a huge silver scar on his face, and Abdul-Mateen will play a character called Pretorian. Those names seem to confirm that the film will indeed be set in “post-apocalyptic” times, and not, as some might have guessed, before the end of the world. Tom Hardy is not expected to reprise his role as Mad Max, as his character would be much younger, and also because Max and Furiosa did not seem to know each other before they met in Fury Road. There is no release date yet for Furiosa, but George Miller plans to start filming in 2021, which suggests a date in 2022 or 2023. You can read here what Anya Taylor-Joy is already saying&nbsp;about being cast as Furiosa, and read here to&nbsp;find out what Miller might have planned for the prequel.Other Top Headlines1. GAL GADOT TO REUNITE WITH&nbsp;PATTY JENKINS&nbsp;FOR CLEOPATRA(Photo by Derek Storm/Everett Collection)Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the world still hasn’t seen Wonder Woman 1984, the second&nbsp;collaboration between star&nbsp;Gal Gadot and director Patty Jenkins following their work together on the first Wonder Woman (Certified Fresh at 93%). We’ve known for a while that Gadot and Jenkins have plans to eventually make a third Wonder Woman movie together, but what we didn’t know until this week is that,&nbsp;in the meantime, they will be reuniting for another movie about a heroine with ancient mythologial roots. Gadot is now attached to star in&nbsp;and Patty Jenkins will direct Paramount Pictures’&nbsp;Cleopatra biopic, based on the life of Cleopatra VII, the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. Cleopatra has been a favorite epic subject for Hollywood&nbsp;since its earliest days, including Cecil B. DeMille’s 1934 film starring Claudette Colbert and the 1963 film starring Elizabeth Taylor. There have been many attempts at Cleopatra biopics over the last several years, including one at Sony Pictures that in the past had both Angelina Jolie and Lady Gaga possibly in talks to star. That Sony project has been in development for over 10 years, and it’s not known at this point whether Sony will push forward to compete with the Gal Gadot version, or whether Sony has given up on Cleopatra completely.2.&nbsp;OSCAR-WINNING DIRECTOR OF&nbsp;HAIR LOVE&nbsp;TO ANIMATE LIFE OF KING&nbsp;TUT(Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images)Marvel Studios’&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;was an milestone for many reasons, but one of them was that it achieved&nbsp;a level of live-action production design&nbsp;and world building that one more usually associates with animation. That style&nbsp;is called “afrofuturism,” and&nbsp;we’re soon going to get&nbsp;a Sony Pictures Animation feature film called&nbsp;Tut, which&nbsp;will interpret the life&nbsp;of young Egyptian pharaoh King Tutankamun through an afrofutristic vision.&nbsp;Tut&nbsp;will be the animated feature film debut of director Matthew A. Cherry, who&nbsp;won the Academy Award this year&nbsp;for Best Animated Short for&nbsp;Hair Love&nbsp;(which you can&nbsp;watch on Facebook right here). Cherry’s vision for&nbsp;Tut&nbsp;“will take audiences on a journey through ancient Egypt and celebrate a culture that introduced the world to countless modern conventions and technologies.” There is no voice casting news for&nbsp;Tut&nbsp;yet, and given the production time for major animated films, we probably can’t expect to see it released until 2023 or later. Matthew A. Cherry&nbsp;will also be producing&nbsp;a 12 episode&nbsp;Hair Love&nbsp;spin-off series for HBO Max called&nbsp;Young Love.3. JOAQUIN PHOENIX GETS GOOD PART AS BONAPARTE IN KITBAG(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Just last week, we learned that 90 year old Clint Eastwood is preparing to direct and star in his next movie Cry Macho, and this week, another director who’s nearly as old also announced a major new project. 82-year-old Ridley Scott wrapped filming this week on The Last Duel, starring Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, and Adam Driver, and then in March, he will start filming Gucci, starring Lady Gaga. And then, after that (at which point he will be 83), Scott will direct Joaquin Phoenix in the epic Napoleon Bonaparte biopic Kitbag. The title reportedly refers to the kitbags carried by soldiers during war, and the expression that “there is a general’s staff hidden in every soldier’s kitbag.” The ambitious biopic will reportedly cover Napoleon’s, “swift, ruthless climb to emperor, viewed through the prism of his addictive and often volatile relationship with his wife and one true love, Josephine.” Although Napoleon was a popular subject in Hollywood’s earliest years, there hasn’t been a major such movie since 1970’s Waterloo (Rotten at 27%), the box office failure of which is often cited as the reason why Stanley Kubrick gave up on his own Napoleon biopic in which Jack Nicholson would have starred.4.&nbsp;SELENA GOMEZ TO STAR IN&nbsp;BLACK SWAN-STYLE&nbsp;THRILLER SET IN FASHION WORLD(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Although Selena Gomez has stayed busy with her music (and the videos that go with it), supporting roles in movies like The Dead Don’t Die (Rotten at 54%), and a Woody Allen movie few people have seen, you actually have to go back four years to 2016 and Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising (Fresh at 64%) to find a movie in which Gomez had a prominent role (and even that was as part of an ensemble). Gomez appears intent on fixing that soon, with this week’s new project, and also the recent news that Gomez’s voice role&nbsp;in&nbsp;Hotel Transylvania 4&nbsp;may be larger than we originally thought. Gomez will produce ( and will likely also star) in a psychological horror film for STXfilms called Dollhouse, which is being compared to Black Swan, but set in the fashion world of New York City. Gomez’s producing partners on Dollhouse will include Shaun Levy’s 21 Laps Entertainment, whose filmography includes Arrival, Fist Fight, Kin, and Ryan Reynolds’ upcoming action movie Free Guy. (This probably goes without saying, but just to be clear, Selena Gomez’s Dollhouse also has nothing to do with the FOX TV series starring Eliza Dushku.)5. SAMMY DAVIS JR. MAY BE FIRST RAT PACK MEMBER TO GET HIS OWN BIOPIC(Photo by Everett Collection)Over the last 20 years or so, there have been a few different attempts to adapt the lives of famous 1950s/1960s “Rat Pack” members&nbsp;like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin as biopics, but&nbsp;neither ever came to be (though HBO did portray them collectively in 1998’s The Rat Pack, Rotten at 57%). With no active development for biopics about either of those crooners, it’s now looking more likely that the first major feature film about the life of a Rat Pack member will instead be about the life&nbsp;of Sammy Davis, Jr.&nbsp; Lena Waithe (Master of None, Ready Player One) is producing the Sammy Davis, Jr. biopic with MGM, and the screenplay will be adapted from the memoir Sammy Davis Jr: My Father by his daughter Tracey Davis. Sammy Davis Jr. had many personal distinctions, including both African American and Jewish heritage, multiple starring film roles, and several songs that made it to the Top 20 pop charts, including “Something’s Gotta Give,” “Love Me or Leave Me,” and “I’ve Got to Be Me” (possibly a great title for his biopic?).6. GODZILLA PRODUCERS REBOOTING CLASSIC SCI-FI HERO BUCK ROGERS&nbsp;(Photo by ©NBC courtesy Everett Collection)We’re all so used to science fiction and superheroes that we can easily take it for granted that they’ve always been around, but the origins for many genre concepts are relatively new. For example, it was “only” 92 years ago in 1928 that the sci-fi adventurer Buck Rogers was first introduced (predating Flash Gordon, John Carter of Mars, and thousands of superheroes, including Superman). Although Buck Rogers went on to become a popular 1930s and 1940s comic strip and serial star, the character has been relatively underused ever since, except for the 1979-1981 TV series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (starring Gil Gerard and Erin Gray), which may be well-remembered by Generation X, but probably not by&nbsp;many under 40. After several months of negotiations, Legendary Entertainment, the production company behind recent reboots like Godzilla and Dune, is now in development on a new feature film that would reboot Buck Rogers,&nbsp;focusing on a man who wakes up from centuries of suspended animation 500 years in the future. It’s not yet known which version of Buck Rogers will be adapted, including for example, whether the reboot might include characters from the TV show like Twiki the robot and Erin Gray’s Wilma Deering. In tangentially related news, Walt Disney Pictures is also now developing a feature film&nbsp;based on the popular theme park attraction Space Mountain.7. SANDRA BULLOCK’S ADVENTURE TO THE LOST CITY OF D &nbsp;(Photo by ©Warner Bros.)It might feel a lot longer ago than 2009, but that was indeed the year that the romantic comedy The Proposal (Rotten at 45%), which as it turned out, was sort of one of the “last hurrahs” for the romantic comedy genre as a major Hollywood release (they’re more common these days&nbsp;on streamers than in major theatrical releases). But when people do eventually go back to movie theaters post-COVID-19, they are still going to want date movies, so it’s not at all surprising that some “rom-coms” are still in development, especially when they’re hybrids with other genres. Sandra Bullock will produce and is attached to star in a Paramount Pictures romantic adventure called The Lost City of D, which is being compared to the 1984 classic Romancing the Stone. Although he’s not signed, the producers reportedly also hope to recruit Bullock’s Proposal co-star Ryan Reynolds to join her in their first movie together since. Sandra Bullock will star as an author who discovers that the “fictional” city she’s written about is actually real, leading her to try to discover its location. The most recent screenplay draft was written by Dana Fox (Isn’t It Romantic, Couples Retreat).8. ANIMATED WIZARD OF OZ SPINOFF MOVIE IN THE WORKS FOR DOROTHY’S LITTLE DOG TOTO TOO(Photo by Everett Collection)Children’s author L. Frank Baum wrote 14 Oz books, but the argument could be made that the amazing success of The Wizard of Oz has left such an overwhelming legacy that the other books were not adapted as frequently (or at all) as they would have been if the 1939 The Wizard of Oz had never existed. (Of course, the Oz would has indeed been revisited, usually as “reimaginings” like the Broadway musical Wicked, or the R&amp;B musical The Wiz.) Warner Animation Group is now developing another film in that vein, as the studio has made a deal&nbsp;with two-time Tony-nominated director Alex Timbers (Moulin Rouge!) to direct their musical adaptation of the book Toto: The Dog-Gone Amazing Story of The Wizard of Oz, which, as the title suggests, is basically the same story but from the perspective of Dorothy’s dog. The most recent movie from Warner Animation Group was the prequel Scoob!, which ended up going to VOD because of the pandemic, but the Toto movie is reportedly still fully intended for a theatrical release (given how long animation takes, Toto is still a few years away anyway).9.&nbsp;THE OTHERS IS GETTING A REMAKE(Photo by (c)Dimension Films courtesy Everett Collection)It seems like most movie remakes come from about 20-30 years earlier — for example, the 1980s had lots of 1950s remakes, and the 2000s and 2010s had a lot of remakes from the 1980s. So, as we’re now 20 years from the year 2000, we can expect to see remakes of movies from the aughts start to appear, and one such project made the news this week. Universal Pictures is partnering with Sentient Entertainment (TV’s Feud: Bette and Joan) to develop a remake of the 2001 supernatural thriller The Others ( Certified Fresh at 83% ), starring Nicole Kidman as a mother struggling to protect her children from a supernatural menace in their home. The original movie was set in England in 1945, but it’s possible the remake may have a different setting (possibly modern times, or any other decade). It’s also not yet known who will be adapting the screenplay, or who will be directing the film.On an Apple device?

In 1991, Wes Craven (in his post-Nightmare on Elm Street, pre-Scream years) directed a creepy movie called The People Under the Stairs&nbsp;(Fresh at 66%), which has its fans, but is hardly&nbsp;remembered as a classic of the genre. One producer who appears to think it would be a worthy&nbsp;candidate for a quality remake is Get Out and Us&nbsp;director Jordan Peele, who is teaming up with Universal Pictures for exactly that. Perhaps not coincidentally, this Sunday also happens to mark the 29th anniversary of the original film’s release on November 1, 1991. Another horror remake that Jordan Peele is producing, Candyman, is still awaiting its COVID-19-delayed release date, which is currently tentatively re-scheduled for August 27, 2021, 14 months after its original release date in June.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;INSIDIOUS STAR PATRICK WILSON TO MAKE DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH FIFTH INSTALLMENT(Photo by ©FilmDistrict courtesy Everett Collection)One common concern for fans of long-running horror franchises is how long their stars will stick around. Insidious may not have been named the scariest movie ever recently like Sinister was&nbsp;(or even&nbsp;The Exorcist, according to our own poll), but the four movies to date have brought in over half a billion dollars worldwide. Insidious star Patrick Wilson will not only be returning for a fifth installment, but he’ll also be making his directorial debut with the Blumhouse sequel. Set 10 years after the original Insidious, the central family will now dealing with a big change, as Ty Simpkins’ character is now going off to college. About taking on the film, Wilson said, “I’m honored and thrilled to be at the helm of the next Insidious installment, which will provide an amazing chance to unpack everything the Lamberts went through a decade ago, as well as deal with the consequences of their choices.” Although she wasn’t mentioned in this week’s news, it’s presumed that Rose Byrne will also be returning, and Lin Shaye has been in every Insidious film, so she’s probably likely to come back as well. In related news, Blumhouse is also teaming up with writer and director John Ridley (writer of 12 Years a Slave, Three Kings) for an untitled project based on an arcticle&nbsp;titled Project Poltergeist, a nonfiction story about a young boy who may have experienced paranormal phenomena in New Jersey housing projects during the 1960s.2. CRAZY EX-GIRLFRIEND’s&nbsp;RACHEL BLOOM TO WRITE *NSYNC SUPERFANS MOVIE(Photo by Scott Everett White/©The CW)After airing on The CW for four seasons, the musical comedy series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&nbsp;(Fresh at 98%) came to end in 2019, but its star and co-creator Rachel Bloom is now getting ready for her next project, and it also has a musical theme. Bloom has signed with Sony Pictures to write a movie about two *NSYNC superfans, based on an idea from *NSYNC member Lance Bass, who’s also producing the untitled movie. The movie will be inspired by the true stories of fans Meredith Sandberg and Winter Byington (as described in this Washington Post article titled “N Sync or Bust!“) , who spent a summer following the group during their last world tour. Rachel Bloom said about the project, “I’m so excited to work on this road trip musical that will explore the nature of early 2000s nostalgia and if the past was, indeed, actually better. Also, I GET TO WORK WITH LANCE BASS!” The capital letters were all Bloom’s. It’s not yet known for sure if Rachel Bloom will also appear in the film (or maybe direct?), or if she’s just writing the screenplay.3.&nbsp;FATHER-DAUGHTER DUO ETHAN AND MAYA HAWKE&nbsp;TO STAR IN BEATLEMANIA ROM-COM(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)For many fans of Ethan Hawke, there may have been a “gasp!” moment while watching season 3 of Stranger Things, as people realized that the new character Robin was played by Maya Hawke, A.K.A. the daughter of Hawke and Uma Thurman. For her next project, the two Hawkes will be teaming up for a romantic comedy set during the glory days of 1960s Beatlemania called Revolver (as in the title of The Beatles’ seventh studio album), and the beginning of the band’s shift towards more “psychedelic” sounds.&nbsp; Maya Hawke will play a Beatlemaniac in Alaska who comes up with a plan to give her virginity to shy Beatles guitarist George Harrison when the&nbsp;band unexpectedly had to land there on June 27, 1966 (which did indeed happen). Revolver will be directed by Andrew Stanton, a long-time Pixar collaborator whose credits include Finding Nemo (Certified Fresh at 99%), WALL-E&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 95%), Finding Dory&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 94%), and on the live-action front, John Carter (Rotten at 52%). The press release didn’t say for sure whether Ethan Hawke will be playing Maya’s dad, but that’s probably most likely.4. KATE WINSLET REVEALS HER CRAZY AVATAR 2 UNDERWATER RIG(Photo by Twitter: @officialavatar)Due to various delays (but most obviously and most recently COVID-19), we’re still over two years away from the December 16, 2022 release date of James Cameron’s sequel Avatar 2 (12/16/2022), which will come out 13 years after the first film. It’s worth remembering that two years before Avatar came out, movie fans did know he was working on a movie called Avatar, but we didn’t yet know that half the cast would be giant blue deer-people aliens. In that respect, the new set image showing off Kate Winslet filming a scene underwater&nbsp;is ripe for fan speculation. In the image, we can see Winslet wearing something like a cape that extends out past her arms via sticks, which, to this writer, make it look like&nbsp;she will be playing something like an alien stingray creature. Winslet has already spoken out this week about filming those scenes for Avatar 2, saying that she learned to hold her breath for up to seven minutes (for reference,&nbsp;the world record is 24 minutes). Winslet’s other Avatar 2 co-stars will include Edie Falco, Michelle Yeoh, Jemaine Clement, and returning cast members from the first movie like Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver.5. TAIKA WAITITI PRODUCING NATIVE AMERICAN DRAMA FRYBREAD FACE AND ME(Photo by Jasin Boland/©Marvel)In addition to his own films (from Jojo Rabbit to Marvel movies like Thor: Love and Thunder), writer, director, and producer Taika Waititi also made the news this past summer for signing three Maori writers to tell stories of the indigenous peoples of New Zealand. This week, Waititi widened his support of indigenous filmmakers to include Native Americans with a deal to executive produce a drama called Frybread Face and Me (frybread being a staple food for many Native Americans). Written and directed by Native American filmmaker Billy Luther (who is of Navajo, Hopi, and Laguna Pueblo heritage), Frybread Face and Me will tell the story of two adolescent Navajo cousins from different backgrounds who bond over the course of a summer “herding sheep on their grandmother’s ranch in Arizona while learning more about their family’s past and themselves.” Frybread Face and Me was also one of the projects selected for this year’s Sundance Institute Directors and Screenwriters Labs.6. ARMIE HAMMER&nbsp;AND JENNIFER LOPEZ&nbsp;TO CO-STAR IN ACTION COMEDY&nbsp;SHOTGUN WEDDING(Photo by Priscilla Grant, RCF/Everett Collection)Next week, despite the challenges of COVID-19, the American Film Market will indeed take place, and as with most similar events (Sundance, Cannes, etc.), this week we heard about some of the projects that will be presented to investors at the event. Some actors are habitually popular at international film sales events like AFM, and this week, one such actor appeared to be Armie Hammer (The Social Network, The Lone Ranger), who is attached to star in two movies. Hammer and Jennifer Lopez will co-star in the Lionsgate action comedy&nbsp;Shotgun Wedding, about a “destination wedding” that goes terribly wrong when the entire wedding party is taken hostage. Hammer’s other new project this week is the Cold War thriller&nbsp;The Billion Dollar Spy, co-starring Mads Mikkelsen&nbsp;(Casino Royale,&nbsp;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), based on the true story of a Soviet engineer (Mikkelsen) and his CIA handler (Hammer), and the friendship that the two find together.7. THIS WEEK IN CELEBRITY BIOPICS: RICHARD PRYOR AND ANOTHER B.B. KING MOVIE(Photo by Everett Collection)Last week, this column reported on the news from Wendell Pierce (HBO’s The Wire) that he is going to be playing famed blues guitarist B.B. King in a movie called The Thrill is On. This week, B.B. King’s estate issued a public statement clarifying that there are actually two movies gearing up based on the life of B.B. King, as there will also be an official biopic (separate from The Thrill is On) expected to start filming in 2021. Instead of being a true “biopic,” The Thrill is On is now being described as a “dramatized version of a real-life friendship story in the spirit of the film ‘Round Midnight (or, more recently, perhaps Green Book). In related news, the long-in-development Richard Pryor biopic got a little closer to actually happening this week&nbsp;as black-ish creator Kenya Barris has signed on with MGM to make his feature film directorial debut based on a screenplay he will also write, following a “heated film rights auction.”8.&nbsp;DON’T EXPECT SHERLOCK HOLMES 3 OR THE SAINT ANYTIME SOON(Photo by ©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)The continuing COVID-19 pandemic has slowed down the releases of dozens of movies, and in some cases, it has compelled studios to skip theaters entirely in favor of streaming debuts, like last week’s Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm (Certified Fresh at 85%), which dropped on Amazon Prime. In some cases, however, COVID-19 is also causing films to be indefinitely delayed (or cancelled) altogether. This week, director Dexter Fletcher (Rocketman, Eddie the Eagle) revealed that two of the projects to which he was attached are now on indefinite hold because of the pandemic. Those films are the long-in-development sequel Sherlock Holmes 3 (starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law) and the reboot of the gentleman thief franchise The Saint (previously played on TV by Sir Roger Moore and on film by Val Kilmer). Fletcher said that both films are “up against the same dilemma, the same issue that we all [have]: How do you get large groups of people together to create something and then shift them all around the world? And what do you do with actors that are in a love scene? It’s complicated.” In related news, the biopic Going Electric, starring Timothee Chalamet as Bob Dylan, is also on hold due to the pandemic because&nbsp;it was to have been filmed “all in small clubs with lots of extras in period costumes, so you’ve got lots of hair and makeup.”9. GUARDIAN OF THE GALAXY DAVE BAUTISTA&nbsp;IS ALSO UNIVERSE’S MOST WANTED(Photo by ©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)We still don’t when exactly director James Gunn and Marvel Studios will be able to reunite again for a third Guardians of the Galaxy (definitely don’t expect it before 2023), but one of that film’s stars is striking out on his own in&nbsp;a new sci-fi fantasy. Dave Bautista (A.K.A. Drax) will produce and star in an ambitious sci-fi action movie called Universe’s Most Wanted, in which he will play an “intergalactic peacekeeper” who teams up with the son of a small town sheriff when “a spaceship carrying the universe’s most wanted and dangerous criminals crash lands in their backyard.” If that premise sounds familiar, that may be because it is extremely similar to the 1986 sci-fi cult favorite Critters, except, of course, the aliens in Universe’s Most Wanted&nbsp;will probably be very different. Universe’s Most Wanted will be directed by Brad Peyton, who has previously worked three times with one of Dave Bautista’s former wrestling co-stars, Dwayne Johnson, on Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (Rotten at 45%), San Andreas (Rotten at 50%), and the video game movie Rampage (51%, Peyton’s highest RT score).On an Apple device?

Consider, for example, the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Back in 1990, the first Captain America movie (Rotten at 13%) didn’t even get a theatrical release in the USA, and it went direct-to-video two years after it was made. Similar to the contemporary&nbsp;popularity of comic books, the role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons is much more in vogue now than it was in 1990, when the first Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie (Rotten at 10%) was released. Warner Bros. had been trying for several years to get a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie produced, including periods&nbsp;when actors like Ansel Elgort and Vin Diesel were either in talks or were approached about starring. Since then, the rights to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie moved to Paramount Pictures, which also has the rights to other Hasbro properties like Transformers, Micronauts, and G.I. Joe. The Dungeons &amp; Dragons reboot appears to&nbsp;draw closer to actually happening this week with the news that Chris Pine is now in talks to star and also produce the adaptation. It’s not super surprising that Pine is being eyed by Paramount, as he was also their Captain Kirk in the most recent Star Trek films. The premise and setting of the new&nbsp;Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie are not yet known, except that hopes of it possibly being a Dragonlance adaptation appeared to be dashed earlier this year (Forgotten Realms, though, is still totally possible). What we do know is that Dungeons &amp; Dragons will be directed and written by the team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who co-directed Game Night (Certified Fresh at 85%), and also co-wrote Horrible Bosses and Spider-Man: Homecoming. Daley also starred in Freaks &amp; Geeks, which memorably had a very special Dungeons &amp; Dragons episode. In addition to Wonder Woman 1984 (12/25/2020), Chris Pine will also soon be seen in the thriller Violence of Action, Olivia Wilde’s Don’t Worry Darling, and the spy film All the Old Knives.Other Top Headlines1. MILLIE BOBBY BROWN JOINS&nbsp;THE RUSSO BROTHERS’&nbsp;ELECTRIC STATE(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)After directing four films for Marvel Studios (the two most recent Captain America and Avengers films), Joe and Anthony Russo are next directing films for two streaming apps: Cherry for Apple+ and The Grey Man for Netflix. We now know what film might be the duo’s&nbsp;return to theatrically targeted feature films, as they are now signed to direct and produce a science fiction film&nbsp;for Universal Pictures. Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown is attached to star in Electric State, which will be an adaptation of the graphic novel of the same title. Brown will play a teenage girl who goes on an adventure with a toy robot to discover what happened to her missing brother “in an imaginative world of humans mixing with robots, uncovering a grand conspiracy in the process.” The Electric State screenplay is being adapted by screenwriting partners Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who previously worked with the Russo brothers on all four of their Marvel movies, as well as The Grey Man. Directly addressing the “theatrical or streaming” question, Joe and Anthony Russo said in their announcement that, “We’re thrilled to have this deal with Universal who has committed to a theatrical release of Electric State.” In addition to season 4 of Stranger Things, Millie Bobby Brown will also soon be seen in the monster movie sequel, Godzilla vs Kong (5/21/2021), which will premiere both in theaters and on HBO Max.2. FLORENCE PUGH JOINS MYSTERY&nbsp;THE MAID(Photo by A24)After decades of relative absence from mainstream box office prominence, the mystery genre appears to be coming back, following the $300+ million takes of both Murder on the Orient Express ($352 million worldwide) in 2017 and Knives Out ($311 million worldwide) in 2019. The de facto sequel to that first film, Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile would have come out by now if not for the COVID-19 pandemic, but is now scheduled for September 17, 2021. We can also add a film called The Maid, which Universal Pictures is adapting from a novel to be published in 2022 (possibly after the movie comes out to avoid spoilers). Florence Pugh (Midsommar, Black Widow) is now signed to produce and star in The Maid as the title character, who works at a fancy hotel where she uses her access to learn the dirty secrets of every one of the guests (the novel is also being compared to 2017’s Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine). In addition to Black Widow (5/7/2021), Pugh will also soon be seen in Olivia Wilde’s Don’t Worry, Darling, and in the Disney+ series Hawkeye (reprising her Black Widow character).3. RISE OF SKYWALKER COSTAR SAYS I WANNA DANCE WITH SOMEBODY(Photo by Jonathan Olley/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)When most American fans saw last year’s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (Rotten at 51%), they were probably unfamiliar with Naomi Ackie, who played Jannah, the leader who assists our heroes on Kef Bir. Ackie is better known in the U.K., however, where she has won the 2017 British Independent Award for Most Promising Newcomer for Lady MacBeth (Certified Fresh at 88%) (starring the aforementioned Florence Pugh, by the way), and this year, won a BAFTA TV Award for Best Supporting Actress in The End of the F***ing World (Fresh at 93%). The British actress is about to have a much higher profile among American moviegoers, though, as she is in final negotiations with Sony Pictures to star as the late pop superstar&nbsp;Whitney Houston in the musical biopic, I Wanna Dance with Somebody (which takes its title from the hit single “I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)” off Houston’s second album). I Wanna Dance with Somebody will be directed by Stella Meghie, whose most recent film was this year’s The Photograph (Fresh at 74%), starring Issa Rae and LaKeith Stanfield. Meghie will be directing&nbsp;from a screenplay by screenwriter Anthony McCarten, who also wrote the Queen biographical musical Bohemian Rhapsody (Fresh at 60%). About casting Naomi Ackie, Meghie said, “I was moved by her ability to capture the stage presence of a global icon while bringing humanity to her interior life.”4. SETH MCFARLANE BACKING REBOOT OF 1980S COMEDY HIT REVENGE OF THE NERDS(Photo by ©20th Century Fox Film Corp. courtesy Everett Collection)Like some other 1980s comedies, there are scenes in the 1984 hit Revenge of the Nerds that have glaringly not aged well at all in our post-#metoo era. Now, as many other movies from the era continue to be rebooted, Family Guy creator Seth McFarlane is preparing to do the same thing for Revenge of the Nerds, which he’ll be producing for 20th Century Studios. The project already has its comedy leads lined up, as identical twin brothers Keith and Kenny Lucas, who costarred in 22 Jump Street (Certied Fresh at 84%), are set to both star and write the adapted screenplay. The only brothers in Revenge of the Nerds were of the fraternity variety, so if they play “actual” brothers in the remake, that alone will be a significant departure from the original premise (though the film is reportedly more of a reboot than a direct remake anyway, so the entire premise might be significantly different). As Variety puts it, “instead, the contemporary reimagining will pontificate about today’s nerd culture and what even constitutes a geek in the 21st century.” It’s worth noting that this is not the first attempt at rebooting Revenge of the Nerds, which almost happened in 2006 until “officials at Emory University in Atlanta objected to some of the raunchy hijinx in the script.”5. SAM ROCKWELL TO STAR IN MOVIE ABOUT NISSAN-CEO-TURNED-FUGITIVE(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Although he is far from a household name in the USA, the story of former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn really does read exactly like a movie script. Following an arrest in 2018 for charges of “misuse of company assets,” Ghosn proceded through a series of legal ins-and-outs and evasion of arrest ultimately leading in 2019 to his becoming an internationally wanted fugitive still sought by Interpol. MGM is going “all in” on adapting the life story of former Green Beret Michael Taylor, the American security contractor who assisted Ghosn in his evasion from arrest and capture. Sam Rockwell is now attached to produce and star as Michael Taylor in a feature film about Ghosn’s escape, which will be developed concurrently to an MGM TV series which will also adapt Taylor’s earlier life story (with a different actor to be cast as the younger Michael Taylor). Both the Sam Rockwell movie and the prequel TV series are being adapted from a Vanity Fair article about Michael Taylor and Carlos Ghosn, which you can read right here.6. BEN MENDELSOHN JOINS SHAILENE WOODLEY IN&nbsp;MISANTHROPE(Photo by JA, Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Anything pre-COVID-19 feels like decades ago, even if it’s only been months, but this story starts back in May of 2019 at the the Cannes Film Festival, when a serial killer film called Misanthrope was first announced. Shailene Woodley has since then been attached to star as a police officer recruited by the FBI to assist in the tracking down of a serial killer, and now we know that the “lead cop” in Misanthrope will be played by acclaimed Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn is currently filming the latest version of Cyrano (de Bergerac), starring Peter Dinklage, and he was also announced by Disney last week to be reprising his Skrull character in the Disney+ series Secret Invasion, along with Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.7.&nbsp;THIS YEAR’S BLACK LIST INCLUDES STAN LEE AND JACK KIRBY MOVIE EXCELSIOR!(Photo by Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images)At the end of every year since 2005, The Black List of Unproduced Screenplays has served as a survey of hundreds of film industry executives to find which screenplays appear on the highest number of “most liked” screenplay lists. The Black List takes those results and publishes the titles and premises of all of the screenplays that received at least 7 mentions. This year’s top pick, with 29 votes, is a “cannibal drama” called Headhunter&nbsp;about a serial killer who uses Instagram to find their next victim, until the latest target turns out to be someone totally into it (gross). #2 with 28 votes is a basketball comedy called Chang Can Dunk, and #3 with 26 votes is Neither Confirm Nor Deny, which tells the true story of a secret CIA operation that acquired a nuclear-armed USSR submarine in 1968. One of the most intriguing projects, coming in with 9 votes is Excelsior!, which tells the true story of the friendship and collaborative partnership between Marvel Comics editor and writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, who together created such characters as Fantastic Four, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and The X-Men. Other projects on this year’s Black List include Ripper (as in Jack The), Enemies Within (about Senator Joseph McCarthy and the HUAC), and Gusher (about Anna Nicole Smith). You can browse through the entire Black List of this year’s screenplays (in PDF format)&nbsp;right here.8. SHE’S ALL THAT STAR RACHAEL LEIGH COOK JOINS REMAKE HE’S ALL THAT(Photo by Miramax)While Rachael Leigh Cook fans are left still awaiting the (probably unlikely) Josie and the Pussycats sequel, as it turns out, they will at least have the remake of She’s All That (Rotten at 41%) called He’s All That. That’s because we can now report that Rachael Leigh Cook has indeed joined the cast of the gender-swapped remake,&nbsp;although not as the character she played in the first film (since it’s a remake and not a direct sequel). Instead, Cook will play the mother of the female lead (played by Addison Rae) who, in this version, oversees the makeover of an awkward teenage boy (played by Tanner Buchanan), whereas in the original film, those two roles were the opposite genders. He’s All That will be directed by Mark Waters, whose filmography includes notable Lindsay Lohan vehicles like Mean Girls (Certified Fresh at 84%) and Freaky Friday (Certified Fresh at 88%).9. YAHYA ABDUL-MATEEN II JOINS&nbsp;JAKE GYLLENHAAL IN AMBULANCE(Photo by Warner Bros.)Michael Bay immediately followed his run as the director of several Transformers movies with the Netflix project 6 Underground (Rotten at 36%), starring Ryan Reynolds. For his next project as director, Michael Bay is returning to a theatrically-distributed action thriller in the form of a remake of a 2005 Danish film called&nbsp;Ambulancen, which unsurprisingly translates to English as Ambulance. Jake Gyllenhaal has been attached to star in Ambulance since the project was first announced, but this week, we learned who two of his costars will be. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who recently has starred in two different DC Comics adaptations (as Black Manta in Aquaman, and in a role-we-won’t-spoil in HBO’s Watchmen) has joined the cast in an undisclosed role. The premise of the original film involved two fugitive brothers hijacking an ambulance, and it appears that the female ambulance driver they inadvertently kidnap will be played by&nbsp;Eiza Gonzalez, who will also soon be seen in Godzilla vs Kong, when it premieres in theaters and on HBO Max (5/21/2021).On an Apple device?

So, this week and next, we’re going to review 12 of the year’s top stories, presented to you in monthly chronology. The year-in-review begins with the “Fresh Developments” of 2020, and we’ll continue next week with the year’s “Rotten Ideas.”JANUARY: TAIKA WAITITI CONTRIBUTING TO THE MARVELOUS FUTURE OF STAR WARS(Photo by Jasin Boland/©Marvel)Lucasfilm and Disney obviously wanted to continue making Star Wars movies after Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, but the “who” (and presumably the “what”) has changed repeatedly in just the last couple of years. For example, former plans for Star Wars Story movies like Boba Fett and Obi-Wan were shelved (in favor of the now planned shows on Disney+), and there was also a period when Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were developing a future Star Wars trilogy, as well as&nbsp;another project from The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson. If one wants to find a single clear trend for Star Wars, a strong argument can be made for the influence of Marvel. That influence continued in January when we learned that Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok) had reportedly been approached by Lucasfilm about developing his own Star Wars movie. Waititi’s Star Wars project was confirmed in May with the news that he was also writing the project.&nbsp;In related news, this was also a big year for Waititi’s next Marvel Studios film, Thor: Love and Thunder (5/6/2022), including the casting of Christian Bale as the film’s villain, who we now know will be Gorr the God Butcher. Waititi also teased in April that Thor: Love and Thunder will feature what he’s calling “space sharks.” We’re still waiting for clarification on what exactly that means, but sure, why not? You do you, Taika Waititi.FEBRUARY: JAMES MANGOLD&nbsp;TO REPLACE SPIELBERG ON INDIANA JONES 5(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)When Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, the obvious focus was on the Star Wars franchise, but Indiana Jones was another long-running property that Disney acquired at the same time. By that point, Paramount had already been developing an Indiana Jones 5 for a few years (basically since the 2008 release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Certified Fresh at 78%), which continued until the film finally received a release date of July 19, 2019. That obviously didn’t happen, with the release date finally landing on July 29, 2022 (16 days after Harrison Ford turns 80). With Steven Spielberg still working on his West Side Story remake (12/10/2021), there had been recent speculation about Indiana Jones 5, which was cleared up back in February&nbsp;when Spielberg dropped out of directing it. Instead, we learned James Mangold (Logan, The Wolverine, Ford v Ferrari)&nbsp;was in talks to direct Indiana Jones 5, with Harrison Ford still attached as the film’s star. The decision to hire Mangold to direct what will probably be Ford’s last film as the adventuring archaeologist also inspired comparisons to Mangold’s&nbsp;work on&nbsp;Logan, Hugh Jackman’s last film as Wolverine.MARCH:&nbsp;ANYA TAYLOR-JOY TO&nbsp;PLAY&nbsp;FURIOSA IN&nbsp;MAD MAX: FURY ROAD PREQUEL(Photo by Linda Kallerus/Netflix)Everyone has had their own personal way to pass the time during their COVID-19-related quarantines, but apparently, directors like George Miller chose to push forward on a new film, specifically&nbsp;searching for the new star of his prequel to the 2015 fan favorite Mad Max: Fury Road (Certified Fresh at 97%). Furiosa will reportedly depict what Charlize Theron’s character was doing years before meeting Mad Max, so Miller was looking for a younger actress for the role and “Skype-tested” various actresses to that end.&nbsp;The one name that was floated out&nbsp;back in March was 23-year-old Anya Taylor-Joy, who first came to most people’s attention as the star of The Witch and Split&nbsp;before enjoying a big 2020 in&nbsp;the Jane Austen adaptation&nbsp;Emma., the Marvel movie The New Mutants, and the smash hit Netflix series&nbsp;The Queen’s Gambit.&nbsp;Miller hopes to start filming Furiosa sometime in 2021 after he wraps filming of his current project, Three Thousand Years of Longing, starring Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton. In October, Anya Taylor-Joy was indeed confirmed to star&nbsp;as Furiosa, along with Australian star Chris Hemsworth (Marvel’s Thor, obviously), and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who played both Black Manta in Aquaman and Doctor Manhattan in HBO’s Watchmen (our apologies if that’s a spoiler for a show that aired a year ago). Hemsworth will reportedly play a character called Dementus who has a huge silver scar on his face, and Abdul-Mateen will play a character called Pretorian. Those names seem to confirm that the film will indeed be set in “post-apocalyptic” times&nbsp;and not, as might have guessed, before the end of the world. Tom Hardy is not expected to reprise his role as Mad Max, as his character would be much younger, and also because Max and Furiosa had not seemed to know each other in Fury Road. You can read here what Anya Taylor-Joy said in October&nbsp;about being cast as Furiosa, as well as an editorial about what George Miller might have planned for the prequel.APRIL: DISNEY AND AVENGERS DIRECTORS DEVELOPING LIVE-ACTION HERCULES REMAKE(Photo by ©Walt Disney Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Of the 10 animated features that Walt Disney Pictures released in the&nbsp;decade that began in 1989 with the release of The Little Mermaid, four of them have had remakes in recent years (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, and just this year,&nbsp;Mulan), and two&nbsp;currently in the works (The Little Mermaid&nbsp;and The Hunchback of Notre Dame). We’re probably never going to get a live-action Rescuers Down Under, so of those ten, that just leaves Pocahontas, Tarzan, and Hercules, and after this week,&nbsp;we can whittle that number down even further to&nbsp;just two. Back in April, it was announced that Walt Disney Pictures is now developing a live-action remake of their 1997 mythological animated musical Hercules (Certified Fresh at 84%). The Hercules remake has two direct connections to Marvel Studios in the form of producers Joe and Anthony Russo (the directors of Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame) and screenwriter Dave Callaham, who is currently working on Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (5/7/2021). It is reportedly unclear if the remake will have musical songs from the original&nbsp;or if it will be a non-musical remake a la Mulan, and we don’t yet know who will direct&nbsp;it (although there have been some rumors). Another question left to be addressed is where this puts Marvel’s own version&nbsp;of Hercules, who is one of the earliest members of the Avengers (#11, just before Black Panther and Vision), and one of the longest-running team members as well (his longest stint was in the 1990s). Will Disney’s Hercules kill any chances of Marvel’s Hercules from ever joining the MCU, or does the involvement of the Russo Brothers suggest some sort of overlap?MAY: TOM CRUISE TO BE THE SOLAR SYSTEM’S FIRST OUTER SPACE MOVIE STAR(Photo by ©Universal Pictures)It was probably always inevitable, but Hollywood is finally making its way to outer space, and it’s going to be done by one of the industry’s biggest stars. In May, we learned that Tom Cruise and Elon Musk’s Space X were collaborating on the solar system’s first narrative feature to be filmed in outer space. The action-adventure will not be part of Cruise’s Mission: Impossible franchise, and no studio is currently attached. NASA was also quick to announce this week that the project will also film on the International Space Station, which suggests that Cruise may be spending some time on the station himself, possibly for an extended period, even. A few weeks later, we learned that Cruise will be reuniting with director Doug Liman, with whom he has previously worked on both Edge of Tomorrow (Certified Fresh at 90%) and American Made&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 86%), for the film. (They’re also both committed to an Edge of Tomorrow sequel, by the way.) Incidentally, Cruise and Liman had previously been developing a movie called Lunar Park (about “renegade employees who venture to the moon to steal an energy source”), but this new project is reportedly a separate film.JUNE: DISNEY AND LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA GOING TO COLOMBIA FOR ENCANTO(Photo by Lev Radin/Everett Collection)After attaining fame with Hamilton on Broadway, Lin-Manuel Miranda expanded into film and animation, including work with Disney on Mary Poppins Returns (in which he co-starred) and Moana (he co-wrote the songs). We’ve also known for a while that Miranda has a project with Sony Animation called Vivo (6/4/2021), and in June, another new project with Disney Animation was revealed. Talking to Good Morning America, Miranda mentioned that he is spending his quarantine-at-home time working on an untitled Disney animation project set in Colombia. Reportedly, the project will be directed by Byron Howard and Jared Bush, who worked with Miranda as the directors of Moana (Certified Fresh at 95%). This news came just a few days after this Disney blog reported that Miranda, Howard, and Bush were working on a Disney musical called Encanto (Spanish for “charm”) about a young girl from a magical family who does not have any magical powers herself. Walt Disney Pictures has scheduled Encanto for a theatrical release on November 24, 2021, which is currently also the release date of Ridley Scott’s Gucci, starring Lady Gaga and Adam Driver.JULY: RYAN GOSLING AND THE INVISIBLE MAN DIRECTOR&nbsp;SET TO COLLABORATE ON&nbsp;WOLFMANOne of the last movies to enjoy a decent theatrical run in early 2020 right before COVID-19 cast its shadow on the rest of the year was Universal Pictures’ remake of their classic monster movie, The Invisible Man (Certified Fresh at 91% ), directed by&nbsp;Leigh Whannell, the Australian&nbsp;producer, director, and screenwriter who got his start collaborating on the Saw with future Aquaman director James Wan.&nbsp;That film happened after Universal Pictures scrapped their previous “Dark Universe” plans&nbsp;to reboot their classic monsters,&nbsp;which would have included Johnny Depp starring in The Invisible Man and rumors of Dwayne Johnson possibly starring&nbsp;in Wolfman. Despite opening just as the pandemic kicked into high gear,&nbsp;The Invisible Man&nbsp;was otherwise a financial success, so Univeral Pictures is moving forward with similar reboots, including Wolfman. In July, the news broke that Ryan Gosling was Universal’s top choice&nbsp;to star in Wolfman, and seemingly confirming that Gosling has indeed signed on,&nbsp;the studio also began talks&nbsp;with Whannell about writing and directing&nbsp;the film&nbsp;to continue the thread between The Invisible Man and their ambitious werewolf movie. Leigh Whannell and Ryan Gosling have reportedly wanted to work together “for some time.”AUGUST: SONY RECRUITS BOOKSMART DIRECTOR OLIVIA WILDE FOR SPIDER-WOMAN (MAYBE)(Photo by Francois Duhamel/©Annapurna Pictures)Although “SPUMC” is a pretty clumsy abbreviation, Sony Pictures does indeed have a massive “Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters” slate planned. In addition to Venom and the upcoming Morbius (3/19/2021, delayed from 7/10/2020 because of COVID-19), the SPUMC development schedule currently includes: Jackpot, Kraven the Hunter, Madame Web, Nightwatch, Silk, and The Sinister Six. One of the most talked about stories in August was the announcement that Sony had officially hired actress-turned-director Olivia Wilde for an “untitled female-centric Marvel movie.” Most of the stories about Wilde’s hiring speculated that the secret project was probably Spider-Woman, A.K.A.&nbsp;Jessica Drew, who debuted in the comics in 1977 before soon after getting her own Saturday morning cartoon (which you can now watch on Disney+). It’s also possible that Wilde’s project could be about another “Spider” woman hero, like Silk, Ghost-Spider (A.K.A. Spider-Gwen), Madame Web, or someone previously unmentioned like Spider-Girl or Araña (Peter Parker has got a lot of female counterparts). Olivia Wilde’s next project as director will be a thriller called Don’t Worry Darling, starring Florence Pugh, Dakota Johnson, Shia LaBeouf, and Chris Pine.SEPTEMBER: DISNEY RECRUITS BARRY JENKINS&nbsp;FOR THEIR LION KING SEQUEL(Photo by Steven Ferdman/Everett Collection)It no doubt still stings some Disney fans a little that last year’s photorealistic remake of The Lion King (Rotten at 52%) ended up with a Rotten Tomatometer score. Despite the critical reaction, though, Walt Disney Pictures absolutely did have an astounding success with the remake, which ended 2019 as the year’s second highest grossing box office hit, second only to Avengers: Endgame (the highest grossing movie ever). So, it was perhaps not at all surprising that Walt Disney Pictures is indeed moving forward with plans for a sequel to The Lion King. The studio, possibly hoping to attract higher critical scores this time around, also upped their game by hiring director Barry Jenkins, who is probably still best known for his 2016 film Moonlight (Certified Fresh at 98%), which won three Academy Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor, and in a historic reveal, Best Picture. We learned early on&nbsp;that instead of adapting either of the original film’s two direct-to-video sequels, the new film will instead serve as a prequel depicting the early years of Mufasa, Simba’s father. The Lion King&nbsp;prequel is being adapted by screenwriter Jeff Nathanson, who also wrote last year’s photorealistic remake.OCTOBER: GAL GADOT TO REUNITE WITH PATTY JENKINS&nbsp;FOR CLEOPATRA(Photo by Derek Storm/Everett Collection)Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, HBO Max is streaming Warner Bros.’&nbsp;Wonder Woman 1984, the second film&nbsp;directed by Patty Jenkins and starring Gal Gadot as the titular superhero, on Christmas Day. We’ve known for a while that Gadot and Jenkins do have plans to eventually make a third Wonder Woman movie together, but what we didn’t know was that they will be reuniting for another movie about a heroine with ancient mythologial roots. As of mid-October, Gal Gadot is now attached to star&nbsp;in a Paramount Pictures Cleopatra biopic directed by Patty Jenkins and&nbsp;based on the life of Cleopatra VII, the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. Cleopatra has been a favorite subject for Hollywood epics since its earliest days, including Cecil B. DeMille’s 1934 film starring Claudette Colbert and the 1963 film starring Elizabeth Taylor. There have been a number of attempts at Cleopatra biopics over the last several years, including one at Sony Pictures that in the past had both Angelina Jolie and Lady Gaga possibly in talks to star. That Sony project has been in development for over 10 years, and it’s not known at this point whether Sony will push forward to compete with the Gal Gadot version&nbsp;or give up on Cleopatra completely.NOVEMBER: A QUIET PLACE TO GET ITS OWN CINEMATIC UNIVERSE(Photo by Paramount Pictures)If the COVID-19 pandemic had never happened, A Quiet Place Part II would have come out a little over nine months ago (March 20, 2020). Around that time, John Krasinski was quoted online as saying he had ideas for a third Quiet Place movie, but in November, the news broke that A Quiet Place will proceed not with a direct sequel, but with a spin-off that expands the franchise’s cinematic universe instead. (This spin-off is also based on a story idea by John Krasinski, so it’s quite possible that it’s the same idea he talked about back in March.) The third film is expected to expand the post-apocalyptic world in which human survivors are stalked by monsters with a super-senstive sense of hearing. Krasinski directed the first two movies (and appeared in both along with his wife Emily Blunt), but the third film will be directed by Jeff Nichols, marking the first time he’s worked on a “franchise film,” after several of his own projects, including Mud (Certified Fresh at 97%), Midnight Special (Certified Fresh at 84%), and Loving (Certified Fresh at 89%). Paramount Pictures is reportedly aiming to release the third Quiet Place movie sometime in 2022. Meanwhile,&nbsp;A Quiet Place Part II, starring Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy, and Djimon Hounsou, is currently scheduled for April 23, 2021, which is over a year after the sequel’s original release date. Although no casting has been announced yet for the third film,&nbsp;it’s worth noting that Michael Shannon has starred or co-starred in every one of Jeff Nichols’ films so far, so we might see&nbsp;him&nbsp;chased by killer monsters soon.DECEMBER: DISNEY INVESTOR CALL REVEALS BIG STAR WARS AND MARVEL PLANSThe Walt Disney Company, like most huge corporations, annually hosts “investor calls” in which they detail some of their plans for future quarters and fiscal years and review financial numbers.&nbsp;If that all sounds pretty dry, it’s because&nbsp;most events like it usually are, except that other companies don’t own&nbsp;Star Wars, Marvel, and Pixar.&nbsp;Much of what was announced&nbsp;just a couple of weeks ago&nbsp;was for the Disney+ streaming app, but there were several big announcements for theatrically released feature films as well. Pixar shared details&nbsp;about their next post-Soul&nbsp;film, the Italy-based&nbsp;Luca&nbsp;(6/18/2021),&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;Turning Red&nbsp;(about a little girl who turns into a red panda, due out 3/11/2022), and the&nbsp;Toy Story&nbsp;sort-of-prequel&nbsp;Lightyear&nbsp;(6/17/2022),&nbsp;starring Chris Evans&nbsp;as the voice of the real&nbsp;Buzz Lightyear&nbsp;upon which the Tim Allen-voiced toy is supposed to be based.&nbsp;Wonder Woman&nbsp;director Patty Jenkins&nbsp;will direct the next&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;movie,&nbsp;Star Wars: Rogue Squadron&nbsp;(12/25/2023), and as we mentioned above, Taika Waititi is also still working on his own&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;movie to be released in 2024 or later. As for Marvel, their waterfall of announcements included confirmation that Christian Bale will co-star in&nbsp;Thor: Love and Thunder&nbsp;(5/6/2022) as the villain Gorr the God Butcher. We also now know that relative newcomer Xochitl Gomez will co-star in&nbsp;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&nbsp;(3/25/2022) as the young superhero America Chavez, who might be newsworthy&nbsp;for multiple reasons.&nbsp;Captain Marvel 2&nbsp;(7/8/2022) will not only give us&nbsp;the MCU feature film debut&nbsp;of Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan, A.K.A.&nbsp;Ms. Marvel&nbsp;on Disney+, but also Teyonah Parris as the adult version of Monica Rambeau (herself a superhero in the comics). We also&nbsp;now have a new title&nbsp;for&nbsp;Ant-Man the the Wasp: Quantumania, which will feature Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang, Ant-Man’s daughter, who in the comics is the superhero Stature. And finally,&nbsp;the director of the three Tom Holland&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;movies, Jon Watts, has also been tapped by&nbsp;Marvel Studios&nbsp;to helm the hotly anticipated&nbsp;Fantastic Four&nbsp;reboot, presumably with plans to incorporate Marvel’s “First Family” into the MCU. It was a whole lot of information to process,&nbsp;but also a whole lot of good stuff to look forward to.On an Apple device?

Specifically for The Avengers, some of their major villains were actually first introduced in Fantastic Four issues, so technically, it was Fox that had the rights to those characters. For example, that’s ostensibly why the Skrulls were replaced by the Chitauri in The Avengers (although they were eventually available for Captain Marvel). Another major Avengers villain who was “off limits” was the time-travelling Kang the Conqueror, who was a Fox property because he is a future descendant of Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four (it should be noted that Kang’s background is super convoluted and includes stories in which he’s actually Reed’s father). Marvel made a major move towards incorporating Kang the Conqueror into the MCU this week by casting Jonathan Majors, the star of HBO’s Lovecraft Country, as a major villain in Ant-Man 3 that most sources are speculating will indeed be Kang the Conqueror. Kang is an obvious natural fit to be introduced in Ant-Man 3, as Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang has already helped introduce time travel elements, most notably in&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame. Film and comics journalists were, of course, quick to start writing their “Who is Kang the Conqueror?” and “What does Kang the Conqueror mean for the MCU?” pieces. There is no current release date for Ant-Man 3, but the delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that it probably won’t come out until sometime in 2023 (or late 2022 at the very earliest).Other Top Headlines1. CHRIS HEMSWORTH “DEFINITELY NOT” GIVING UP PLAYING THOR ANYTIME SOON(Photo by Jay Maidment/©Walt Disney Studios)Whenever Thor: Love and Thunder comes out (tentatively 2/11/2022, depending upon the COVID-19 pandemic), it will make Thor the first MCU character to receive a fourth solo film (Captain America and Iron Man both stopped at three films each). One of the most publicized details about Thor: Love and Thunder has been the revelation that Natalie Portman will be returning as her Jane Foster character, who, as in the comics, will be come the new female incaration of Thor. That has understandably led some fans to speculate that Chris Hemsworth would therefore be retiring his run as the character, but this week, in an interview, he responded to that theory very directly. Hemsworth said, “Are you crazy?! I’m not going into any retirement period. Thor is far too young for that. He’s only 1,500 years old. It’s definitely not a film that I say goodbye to this brand. At least I hope so.” It’s also worth noting that in the comics and at the end of Avengers: Endgame, Thor has sometimes traveled with the Guardians of the Galaxy, so it’s possible that even if Portman takes over one version of Thor, Hemsworth could continue as another. In related news, Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black, Perry Mason) was cast this week as Bruce Banner’s lawyer cousin She-Hulk in the upcoming Disney+ series. It’s not yet been confirmed whether She-Hulk might someday cross over into the MCU movies, but several other of the shows (such as the first two, WandaVision and The Falcon and Winter Soldier) obviously do. In the comics, She-Hulk has been a member of various versions of The Avengers (including the all-female A-Force team) and also had a long run in the 1980s as a member of the Fantastic Four.2. MADONNA TO DIRECT HER OWN MUSICAL BIOPIC(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)Although there have obviously been dozens (hundreds?) of major biopics about major celebrities, it is relatively uncommon for the film’s subject to be directly involved besides possibly as a producer or screenwriter. There have been a handful of films in which where the celebrity played themselves, but the only movie that this writer can think of that the star subject actually directed was Richard Pryor’s Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life is Calling (and even that film was a fictionalized version of Pryor’s life). Of course, Madonna has sort of made an entire career out of doing things differently (which is in itself a “biopic trope”), and so the news was not really that surprising this week that she will be directing her own biopic. The Univeral Pictures project doesn’t yet have a title (though Material Girl seems like an obvious choice?), or a confirmed star to actually play the young Madonna (though recent rumors speculated&nbsp;Ozark star Julia Garner might have it after Madonna started following Garner on Instagram). We’ve known that Madonna was working on something for a few months now, because earlier this year, Madonna revealed that she and Juno (Certified Fresh at 94%) screenwriter Diablo Cody were working on a project during their COVID-19 quarantine time. It’s not yet known if Madonna will be writing any new music for her biopic, or if the actress playing her will do her own singing in the role.3. CHRIS ROCK WRITING SCREENPLAY FOR DAVE CHAPPELE AND SNL PAL ADAM SANDLER(Photo by Kristin Callahan, Priscilla Grant, Jason Smith/Everett Collection)Since the show first started in the 1970s, the success of Saturday Night Live has led to an unintended division of sorts between comedians and comic actors: the SNL alumni and everybody else. One&nbsp;comedian who didn’t graduate from the long-running NBC institution&nbsp;is Dave Chappelle, who instead starred in his own popular sketch show, Chappelle’s Show, from 2003 to 2006. Chris Rock, on the other hand, is&nbsp;a former SNL&nbsp;star who frequently works with his old SNL pals, including Adam Sandler and David Spade. It appears that Rock wants to bring Chappelle into that fold, because&nbsp;the former revealed this week that he has written a new screenplay that he is “giddy” about that he hopes he can co-star in alongside both Dave Chappelle and Adam Sandler. Rock didn’t get into any details about the story, and it’s also not yet known if this would be a feature film, or possibly part of Adam Sandler’s ongoing Netflix package deals.4. ANIME BOX OFFICE CHAMP YOUR NAME GETTING LIVE-ACTION REMAKE(Photo by ©FUNimation)If you’d like to stump one of your anime-loving friends, you could ask them if they know what film currently holds the all-time box office record for an anime feature film. The answer is not any of the obvious guesses, like, say, a Hayao Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli film (though Spirited Away is indeed #2), a Pokemon movie, or a beloved futuristic sci-fi film like Akira or Ghost in the Shell. Nope, with over $358 million worldwide box office, that film is 2016’s Your Name (Certified Fresh at 98%) (released in the USA in 2017),&nbsp;Makoto Shinkai’s romantic fantasy about a young couple who seek to rediscover each other after briefly swapping bodies, Freaky–style. An English-language live-action remake of Your Name is now in active development, with Toho and J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot production company co-producing for Paramount Pictures. Lee Isaac Chung, who won both the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize and the U.S. Dramatic Audience Award at this year’s Sundance Film Festival with his film Minari (Fresh at 100%), is already signed to direct and rewrite the Your Name remake, based off an earlier screenplay draft by Emily V. Gordon (co-writer of The Big Sick, Certified Fresh at 98%). Minari was picked up by A24 for release in the USA, but its release appears to have been held back in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.5. SARAH SNOOK TO STAR IN NEW ADAPTATION OF JANE AUSTEN’S&nbsp;PERSUASION(Photo by Graeme Hunter/HBO)Movies based on the works of Jane Austen have never really gone out of style, but just&nbsp;within the last few years, we’ve gotten new adaptations like&nbsp;Love &amp; Friendship (Certified Fresh at&nbsp; 97%), Emma. (Certified Fresh at&nbsp; 87%), and although it wasn’t a direct adaptation, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (Rotten at 45%). Jane Austen’s last novel, published posthumously in 1817, was Persuasion, and like most of her work, it&nbsp;has been adapted for film and TV several times, though arguably not as famously as her first five novels (Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, and Northanger Abbey). The two most famous versions of&nbsp;Persuasion&nbsp;were both produced for television (in 1995&nbsp;and in 2007), but now Fox Searchlight is preparing a full feature film version. Australian actress Sarah Snook, who is probably currently best known for HBO’s Succession (for which she’s nominated for an Emmy this year) is now signed to star in Persuasion, which will be directed by Mahalia Belo&nbsp;in her feature film debut from a screenplay by Jessica Swale (Summerland,&nbsp;Certified Fresh at 76%). Snook will play the lead, Anne Elliot, who is forced to reconcile her feelings when the naval officer she once rejected returns to England as a celebrated and wealthy ship’s captain (that role is yet to be cast).6. PETER DINKLAGE’S TO PRODUCE AND STAR IN PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER&nbsp;KEITH(Photo by HBO)Peter Dinklage really has been staying quite busy since wrapping his role as Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones, with several films either wrapped or preparing for production. (One of those films, the animated sequel The Croods: A New Age,&nbsp;was just bumped up a month from its original December 23&nbsp;release to Thanksgiving Wednesday, on November 25.) Searchlight Pictures is now partnering with Dinklage, who will executive produce and star in a psychological thriller called Keith. That’s, however, all we know about the premise, as it’s being kept “under wraps,” but we can probably guess Dinklage might play Keith?&nbsp;Keith is expected to fit in with other “genre” movies that Searchlight Pictures has recently released or has coming soon, including Ready or Not, Antlers, and Guillermo del Toro’s remake of Nightmare Alley.7. JAKE GYLLENHAAL TO REUNITE WITH SOUTHPAW DIRECTOR FOR REMAKE OF DANISH THRILLER(Photo by Scott Garfield/©Weinstein Company)Jake Gyllenhaal was out this week (as much as one can be “out” during COVID-19) promoting his latest film, Netflix’s The Devil All the Time (Fresh at 65%), which he produced, starring his Spider-Man: Far from Home co-star Tom Holland. As often happens, this was also an opportunity for one of Gyllenhaal’s future film projects to be announced, and that’s exactly what happened. Jake Gyllenhaal will reunite with his Southpaw (Rotten at 59%) director Antoine Fuqua (who also directed Training Day and The Equalizer) for an English-language remake of the 2018 Danish drama The Guilty&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 97%). Gyllenhaal will star as a 911 call center operator who finds that his attempts to save the life of a caller lead him into a mystery where “nothing is as it seems, and facing the truth is the only way out.”8.&nbsp;SELENA GOMEZ READY TO SPOOKILY TAKE THE SPOTLIGHT WITH HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 4(Photo by ©Sony Pictures Releasing)Although the franchise obviously has a large ensemble cast of comedy voice actors, the Sony Pictures Animation hit Hotel Transylvania (Rotten at 45%)&nbsp;and its sequels have mostly been described in the press and marketing as “Adam Sandler movies.” For Hotel Transylvania 4, which is currently scheduled for release on August 6, 2021 (up against James Gunn’s&nbsp;The Sucide Squad), Sony Pictures made a move this week that suggests the focus of the sequel may tilt more towards&nbsp;Dracula’s daughter Mavis, voiced by Selena Gomez, as Gomez has effectively been promoted to the role of executive producer on the film (a title also held by the franchise’s creator Genndy Tartakovsky). Hotel Transylvania 4 will be directed by the team of Jennifer Kluska and Derek Drymon, who are currently best known for their work on the animated TV shows DC Super Hero Girls (Kluska) and SpongeBob SquarePants (Drymon).9. NEW VOICE STARS FOR SEQUEL THE BOSS BABY: FAMILY BUSINESS ANNOUNCED(Photo by ©20th Century Fox Film Corp.)The movie business operates as a never-ending train of projects that all go through sort of the same standard pattern (development, production, promotion, release), but the COVID-19 pandemic has caused that train change course or, in some cases, stall completely. One odd consequence of this is that, as several major 2020 films&nbsp;are delayed until 2021, the release schedule is getting a little crowded, as Hollywood still has all of the the films that were originally scheduled for 2021 to release. One such film is the sequel to 2017’s animated comedy The Boss Baby (Rotten at 53%) called The Boss Baby: Family Business. Apparently set decades after the first film, Alec Baldwin’s baby character is now an adult, or at least his brother, voiced by James Marsden, is; it’s unclear in the synopsis if the “Boss Baby” is still a baby. Anyway, the new voice cast includes Jeff Goldblum, Eva Longoria, and Amy Sedaris, who plays the sequel’s new genius baby. Universal Pictures is sticking with its original plans to release The Boss Baby: Family Business on March 26, 2021, despite all the new competition in 2021 from delayed 2020 films.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Christmas, italian, golden, Brie, HBO, Comedy, Network, worst, Black, Television, romance, TruTV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/18151100/Jonathan_Majors-Ant-Man3-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"jonathan-majors-cast-as-major-ant-man-3-villain-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509171690706","title":"John Wick 5 Will Film Back-to-Back with John Wick 4, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})John Wick 5 Will Film Back-to-Back with John Wick 4, and More Movie NewsNia DaCosta lands Captain Marvel 2, Mulan goes to Disney+, James Wan reboots Knight Rider, and new roles for Peter Dinklage, Bradley Cooper, and Ryan Reynolds.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 7, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Captain Marvel 2, Cyrano, John Wick 5, and Disney’s Pinocchio.This WEEK’S TOP STORYKEANU REEVES TO FILM JOHN WICK 5 BACK-TO-BACK WITH JOHN WICK 4(Photo by David Lee/©Summit Entertainment)Staging any major film production is a costly affair, so for decades, when a studio knows they’re going to make more than one movie anyway, they will sometimes produce movies back to back, which basically means two or more movies are produced at the same time, using the same cast, crew, etc. The most famous example of back-to-back production was probably Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, but other examples include Keanu Reeves’ two Matrix sequels, the two Back to the Future sequels, and Quentin Tarantino’s two Kill Bill films. Lionsgate obviously has something of a cash cow in their John Wick&nbsp;franchise, so it’s not surprising that this week, the studio announced the greenlighting&nbsp;of John Wick 5, which will be filmed back-to-back with John Wick 4. Lionsgate had originally scheduled John Wick 4 for release on May 21, 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic pushed that film’s production back, so the release was pushed back a year to May 27, 2022. John Wick 5 does not yet have a release date. In related news, director Chad Stahelski (who will be directing the two&nbsp;John Wick sequels) and screenwriter Derek Kolstad (who has written or co-written all of the John Wick movies) are also now signed to adapt an English-language remake of the 2010 South Korean action thriller The Man from Nowhere, whose plot incidentally bears some resemblance to the first&nbsp;John Wick.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;CANDYMAN DIRECTOR&nbsp;NIA DACOSTA TAPPED FOR&nbsp;CAPTAIN MARVEL 2(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)This story is best started with a little bit of recent history. In 2018, director Gina Prince-Bythewood was getting ready to direct the Marvel Comics movie Silver &amp; Black (about Silver Sable and Black Cat) for Sony Pictures for what would have been their 2019 release after Venom, but then the studio flinched and pulled Silver &amp; Black from their calendar, and Prince-Bythewood directed The Old Guard (Certified Fresh at 80%)&nbsp;for Netflix instead. Also in 2018, Selma director Ava DuVernay signed with Warner Bros. to direct the DC Comics property The New Gods, but two years later, we still don’t know when that project will start production. That means that before this week, neither Marvel nor DC had yet had a major superhero movie directed by an African American woman, but it may be Marvel Studios that gets there first. Nia DaCosta (Little Woods, Certified Fresh at 95%), who directed the upcoming Candyman reboot, has signed with Marvel Studios to direct their sequel Captain Marvel 2 (7/8/2022), starring Brie Larson. The premise of Captain Marvel 2 is not yet known, but one possible story could involve Monica Rambeau, who in the comics was the first woman to be called Captain Marvel. Monica Rambeau was depicted as a young girl in the 1990s in the first Captain Marvel movie, but the upcoming Disney+ series WandaVision will introduce Teyonah Parris as the adult version of the character. Other possibilities include the MCU introduction of the New Avengers, and also a continuation of the Kree/Skrull war from the first Captain Marvel. There are seven other Marvel Cinematic Universe movies scheduled before Captain Marvel 2: Black Widow (11/6/2020), The Eternals (2/12/2021), Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (5/7/2021), Tom Holland’s third Spider-Man (12/17/2021), Thor: Love and Thunder (2/11/2022), Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (3/25/2022), and Black Panther II (5/6/2022).2. LIVE-ACTION MULAN TO DEBUT ON DISNEY+ FOR A PREMIUM FEE(Photo by ©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)As studios and theater chains alike struggle with the financial realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walt Disney Pictures arguably made the biggest move of the year by announcing that their epic live-action remake of Mulan (originally scheduled for March 9th) will debut in the United States on September 4, 2020 on Disney+ for a price of $29.99. That price is more than some of this year’s other VOD debuts (like Trolls World Tour for a $19.99 rental), but the difference is that Mulan will not have a “rental window” of 24 or 48 hours, but will instead remain on Disney+ accounts as long as the subscription remains active. Marvel fans were quick to demand a similar release&nbsp;for Black Widow (11/6/2020), but Disney CEO Bob Chapek was quick to promise&nbsp;that the Mulan offer is a “one-off” that will not apply to Black Widow (though the pandemic has repeatedly had a way this year of changing plans and circumstances). Disney’s decision to effectively pull Mulan from theatrical release in most theaters in the US has also had a quick reaction from the theatrical distribution industry. The Mulan news also came in the same week that Disney+ announced that they had met their five year goal of over 60 million subscribers in just eight months. The other, other related news, Lionsgate announced this week that they will also be releasing the Janelle Monáe horror film Antebellum (originally scheduled for 4/24/2020) on PVOD streaming on September 18, 2020.3. BRADLEY COOPER IN TALKS FOR PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON’S 1970S TEEN DRAMA(Photo by John Baer/Rogue Pictures)Many film directors are influenced throughout their career by the period in which they were born, and Paul Thomas Anderson&nbsp;(born in&nbsp;1970) is no different. His first major success, Boogie Nights (Certified Fresh at 93%) was&nbsp;mostly set in the 1970s, Inherent Vice&nbsp;was entirely set then, and the films of the 1970s have had an influence over most of his work, starting with 1996’s Hard Eight. Anderson has also worked with some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, including Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights), Tom Cruise (Magnolia), Daniel Day Lewis (There Will Be Blood), and Joaquin Phoenix (Inherent Vice), and this week, he added another luminary to that list. Bradley Cooper is now in talks with MGM to star in Paul Thomas Anderson’s next untitled project, which is described as a coming-of-age drama about a child actor set in the San Fernando Valley (also the setting of Boogie Nights) in the 1970s, though it’s not yet known what role Cooper will be playing. Cooper’s other upcoming film is Guillermo del Toro’s remake of 1947’s Nightmare Alley (Fresh at 100%).4. PADDINGTON 2 DIRECTOR RECRUITS RYAN REYNOLDS FOR MONSTER MOVIE EVERYDAY PARENTING TIPS(Photo by ©20th Century Studios)One of the more disappointing stories in 2018 was the reporting that director Paul King, who directed both Paddington (Certified Fresh at 97%) and Paddington 2 (Certified Fresh at 100%)&nbsp;likely will not be returning for&nbsp;a third installment. Instead, King is preparing to direct a family comedy called Everyday Parenting Tips set during the “Great Monster Uprising,” based on a short story in The New Yorker, which you can read right here. Universal Pictures has put together a “package” for Everyday Parenting Tips&nbsp;that includes Ryan Reynolds attached to play one of the titular parents, with Paul King directing from a screenplay by the short story’s author, Simon Rich, who also wrote the short story that inspired this week’s Seth Rogen comedy An American Pickle. Bringing to mind Pixar’s Monsters Inc, the story is based on a father’s advice to his kid about what to do if a monster lurks under their bed, and then shows what happens when such Lovecraftian beasties as “Gorgog the Annihilator [and] Ctharga the Eater of Souls” actually do show up.5. PETER DINKLAGE WILL HAVE A NOSE THAT KNOWS THE CYRANO MUSICAL(Photo by HBO)When George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” novels were adapted for HBO as the popular series Game of Thrones, one of the many details that were changed involves the face of Tyrion Lannister, as played by Peter Dinklage. Specifically, it’s Tyrion Lannister’s nose, which for much of the story in the novels doesn’t even exist, while Peter Dinklage’s version instead&nbsp;got away with n nothing but&nbsp;a nasty scar across his cheek, presumably so HBO viewers wouldn’t be disgusted by one of their favorite characters having a huge hole in the middle of his face. In this week’s news, Dinklage is fully going the opposite direction, as he&nbsp;is now attached to star in an MGM musical&nbsp;called Cyrano based on the classic 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac by Edmond Rostand, which has previously been adapted as a film a few different times, including one in 1950 starring Jose Ferrer and one in 1990 starring Gerard Depardieu. Peter Dinklage also starred as Cyrano de Bergerac in a 2018 stage production, and Hayley Bennett, who co-starred opposite Dinklage as Roxanne, will also reprise that role in this musical version. Cyrano will be directed by Joe Wright, who recently earned Gary Oldman a Best Actor Oscar for his performance as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, and whose next film is the upcoming The Woman in the Window (which will debut on Netflix), starring Amy Adams. Ben Mendelsohn and Brian Tyree Henry will also co-star in Cyrano.6. TOM HANKS TO REUNITE WITH ROBERT ZEMECKIS FOR DISNEY’S PINOCCHIO(Photo by Everett Collection)As Walt Disney Pictures proceeds to adapt the bulk of their classic animated canon as live action remakes, one of the biggies that still hasn’t happened yet is 1940’s Pinocchio (Certified Fresh at 100%), which was Disney’s second feature film after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Disney has gotten close in the past few years, with a few different filmmakers attached, but it appears this week that they may have finally found the winning combination. Tom Hanks has remained in talks to co-star as Gepetto, and the new director now being eyed for the job&nbsp;is Robert Zemeckis, himself a frequent collaborator with Tom Hanks.&nbsp;The pair first worked together in Forrest Gump, which was followed a few films later by both Cast Away and The Polar Express. Zemeckis’ next film, still awaiting release during the COVID-19 pandemic, is his remake of Roald Dahl’s The Witches, featuring Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, and Chris Rock.7. JAMES WAN&nbsp;REVVING UP A&nbsp;KNIGHT RIDER REBOOT(Photo by ©Universal TV courtesy Everett Collection)In between directing and producing the first several Saw movies and directing The Conjuring 2 and Aquaman, James Wan&nbsp;also directed the 2014 car heist sequel Furious 7 (Certified Fresh at 82%). Wan is now looking to add another movie featuring, no doubt, some crazy automobile handling, as his Atomic Monster production company is on board bringing back&nbsp;the classic 1982-1986 NBC TV show Knight Rider. David Hasselhoff starred in Knight Rider as Michael Knight, an ex-cop recruited to pilot an A.I.-powered super car called K.I.T.T. as they travel across the United States solving various crimes. This is far from the first time that a Knight Rider movie has been put into development, which dates at least as far back as the 2000s. Former video game writer TJ Fixman is now adapting the Knight Rider screenplay, which will reportedly be set in the present day.8. WHITNEY HOUSTON BIOPIC I WANNA DANCE WITH SOMEBODY LIKELY FOR LATE 2022(Photo by Suzie Gibbons/Getty Images)Following the 2018 box office success of the Queen movie Bohemian Rhapsody, Hollywood has been stepping up its various plans for musical biopics, with both Respect (about Aretha Franklin) and Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis Presley project now due out by late 2021 (thanks, pandemic). One of the projects we’ve been hearing the most about is I Wanna Dance With Somebody, chronicling the life of Whitney Houston. This week, Sony Pictures came on board the project, with director Stella Meghie (The Photograph) now attached. Sony reportedly hopes to start production in time for a release around Thanksgiving, 2022. In the meantime, of course, Meghie and Sony will have to find the singer and/or actress who will be able to reasonably approximate Houston’s singing talent.9. JENNIFER GREY’S NEW DIRTY DANCING MOVIE OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED(Photo by Vestron Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)One of the stories in The Weekly Ketchup just a few weeks ago&nbsp;involved what at the time was just this side of a rumor. What was known was that Jennifer Grey, who probably remains best known for starring in Dirty Dancing (just above playing Ferris Bueller’s sister), was rumored to be producing and starring in a new Dirty Dancing&nbsp;movie, possibly set in the 1990s. The setting is not directly confirmed in this week’s news, but we can now report that Lionsgate has indeed confirmed that they are developing a new Dirty Dancing movie in which Jennifer Grey will star and executive produce. The major new element to be added to the story this week is that the film, whatever it actually is, will be directed by Jonathan Levine, a frequent Seth Rogen collaborator whose credits include 50/50 (Certified Fresh at 93%), Warm Bodies (Certified Fresh at 81%), and Long Shot (Certified Fresh at 81%). It’s not yet known if Levine’s involvement might suggest Rogen could join Jennifer Grey as one of the new Dirty Dancing stars.

Chadwick Boseman.by RT Staff | September 4, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;new projects for Jason Statham, Adam Driver, Jamie Foxx, Daisy Ridley, and more.This WEEK’S TOP STORYADAM DRIVER JOINS NEW FILM FROM WRITERS OF&nbsp;A QUIET PLACE(Photo by ©Netflix)Adam Driver is coming off a monster&nbsp;2019, during which he not only completed his run in the Star Wars sequel trilogy as Kylo Ren but also earned a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his work in Noah Baumbach’s Netflix original film Marriage Story. Next up for Driver is Ridley Scott’s historical drama The Last Duel, which just went back into production after initiating a hiatus due to COVID-19, and he’s in talks for Scott’s next&nbsp;film, the Lady Gaga-powered based-on-true-events crime drama Gucci, but he’s also just landed what could be a very interesting new role. Deadline reports that Driver has signed on to a film called 65, which will be written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, the duo who wrote John Krasinki’s A Quiet Place. Sam Raimi&nbsp;will also be producing the film, which, combined with the presence of Beck and Woods, gives us some idea what kind of movie it will be, though no details on the plot have yet been released. There’s also no indication when 65 will go into production, but considering Driver’s busy schedule and in-demand status, it could be a while.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;JASON STATHAM AND GUY RITCHIE COLLABORATE AGAIN FOR SPY THRILLER(Photo by Gareth Davies/Getty Images)Before he transitioned to big-budget studio blockbusters, Guy Ritchie made his bones with a couple of slick and witty crime capers featuring a then-unknown Jason Statham (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch). After he turned in the live-action remake of Disney’s Aladdin last year, he then returned to those roots with The Gentlemen, albeit without Statham. And while Ritchie and Statham are indeed scheduled to reunite for another caper called Cash Truck, which is currently in post-production, they’ll be taking their talents international with a new spy thriller called Five Eyes. The story will follow an MI6 agent (Statham) who is “recruited by global intelligence alliance ‘Five Eyes’ to track down and stop the sale of a deadly new weapon that threatens to disrupt the world order.” Including the yet-to-be-released Cash Truck (it’s scheduled for January 15, 2021), this will be the fifth collaboration between Ritchie and Statham.2.&nbsp;UPCOMING ZACK SNYDER ZOMBIE MOVIE GETS A PREQUEL AND ANIME SERIES(Photo by ©Netflix)Zack Snyder made a big splash a couple weekends ago during the DC FanDome event when he unveiled the first trailer for “The Snyder Cut” of Justice League, which will air in four parts on the HBO Max streaming service sometime in 2021. In the meantime, Snyder has been working on a little “zombie heist film” called Army of the Dead, purportedly developed as a sequel to his 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead. That film is slated to be released on Netflix, and although we don’t yet know exactly when that’ll be, the streaming giant has gone ahead and greenlit both a prequel film and&nbsp;a spin-off anime series. Prolific German actor Matthias Schweighöfer (Valkyrie, The Command), who will appear in Army of the Dead, will also star in and direct the prequel, which will center on his character, while Army of the Dead writer Shay Hatten (John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum) will write both the prequel and the anime series, the latter of which will be called Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas and focus on Dave Bautista’s character from the film. No word on when we’ll be getting those yet, either.3.&nbsp;JAMIE FOXX, TEYONAH PARRIS JOIN JOHN BOYEGA NETFLIX THRILLER(Photo by Dee Cercone, Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Just a few weeks ago, Netflix released the superhero-themed Project Power to somewhat mixed reviews, further reinforcing their efforts to lean hard into genre entertainment. What set that film apart, like The Old Guard before it, from some of its lesser fare was the presence of A-list talent, namely Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jamie Foxx. Currently, Netflix is gearing up for another production with Star Wars alumnus John Boyega at the lead called They Cloned Tyrone, which will be the directorial debut of Juel Taylor, the screenwriter of Creed II, and Foxx is one of the two new stars who joined it this week. Ther other is Teyonah Parris (Dear White People, If Beale Street Could Talk), who will appear later this year (presumably) in Nia DaCosta’s Candyman. The characters played by Boyega, Foxx, and Parris will be thrust “onto the trail of a nefarious government conspiracy” after a series of eerie events, evidently involving clones, if the title is any indication. In somewhat related news, Boyega also made headlines this week when an interview he did with GQ revealed that he was not a fan of how Disney and the&nbsp;Star Wars sequel trilogy treated its characters of color — Finn in particular — prompting renewed debate over the films.4. DAISY RIDLEY JOINS WWII&nbsp;DRAMA&nbsp;WOMEN IN THE CASTLE(Photo by Nicola Dove/©20th Century Fox Film Corporation)Considering the impact it had on the world, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that we continue to see new films set during World War II, even despite the wealth of stories we already have about the era. The latest is a film called Women in the Castle, a drama adapted from the 2017 novel of the same name by Jessica Shattuck. The story revolves around three women whose husbands were killed in an assassination attempt on Hitler, and how their lives are individually affected by the event. This week we learned that the three women will be played by Daisy Ridley (Rey from the recent Star Wars trilogy), Kristin Scott Thomas (The English Patient, Darkest Hour), and German actress Nina Hoss, who earned widespread acclaim for another recent WWII film, Phoenix. Women in the Castle&nbsp;will be adapted and directed by Jane Anderson, whose 2017 film The Wife earned Glenn Close a number of awards and an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.5.&nbsp;CHLOE GRACE MORETZ JOINS SCI-FI THRILLER&nbsp;MOTHER/ANDROID(Photo by Shane Mahood/Focus Features)Like Zack Snyder, Matt Reeves made an appearance at DC FanDome to stoke anticipation for his upcoming film The Batman, for which he unveiled the very first trailer. As he continues to pull that film together in the face of unforeseen hurdles (more on that below), Reeves is also putting on his producer hat for a new sci-fi film that will be the directorial debut of Mattson Tomlin, who came on board to help Reeves write the script for The Batman and whose most recent script was for Netflix’s Project Power. The new film is called Mother/Android, and it will star Chloe Grace Moretz&nbsp;(who appeared in Reeves’ Let Me In)as a young pregnant woman who flees with her boyfriend from a war between their country and a malevolent artificial intelligence in hopes of giving birth in a safe environment. Tomlin, who also wrote the script, based the story on his own parents who fled the Romanian Revolution. Mother/Android doesn’t have a release date yet, but Tomlin has a number of big projects on the horizon, including the sci-fi drama Little Fish and a big-screen adaptation of the video game Mega Man, so it could be a while.6.&nbsp;DISNEY’S&nbsp;HAUNTED MANSION IS BACK IN DEVELOPMENT(Photo by Walt Disney courtesy Everett Collection)While Disney has gotten mixed results from their films based on theme park attractions, most everyone agrees that 2003’s The Haunted Mansion, starring Eddie Murphy, was a tragic misfire. A few years later in 2010, there was some hope that longtime fan Guillermo del Toro would be able to craft something worthwhile as he set about developing a new take on the ride that would be “scary and fun at the same time, but the scary will be scary.” As the years passed, del Toro struggled to make much headway on the film, even with Ryan Gosling in talks to star at one point, and as recently as 2019, he expressed doubt that the film would ever be made, though he “would love to see a ‘Haunted Mansion’ movie by someone who loves it.” That time may have come, as Disney recently announced they are moving forward with a new adaptation of The Haunted Mansion, this time written by Katie Dippold. Dippold’s most recent credits include the Melissa McCarthy/Sandra Bullock action comedy The Heat, the 2016 reboot of Ghostbusters, and 2017’s Snatched, as well as episodes of Parks and Recreation. The next big movie based on a Disney ride will be Jungle Cruise, starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, which is scheduled to open on July 31, 2021.7.&nbsp;ROBERT PATTINSON, DWAYNE JOHNSON AMONG STARS WHO HAVE CONTRACTED COVID-19(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)As we’ve mentioned frequently over the past few months, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has resulted in film and television production delays across the board, but lost time is nothing when compared to the very real threat of illness, and famous people are, of course, no more immune to COVID-19 than the rest of us. Back in March, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson were the first two high-profile celebrities who revealed they had come down with the virus while filming Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis Presley biopic in Australia (they’re currently recovering),&nbsp; and they were followed by others, like Idris Elba, Sara Bareilles, Daniel Dae Kim,&nbsp;Bryan Cranston, Lena Dunham, and Zoey Deutch, just to name a few. This week, we learned that two more of Hollywood’s biggest stars have also contracted the virus. Dwayne Johnson took to Instagram to announce to his fans that he and his family had tested positive for COVID-19, but were currently “on the other side of it” and recuperating, while it was also revealed that Matt Reeves’ production of&nbsp;The Batman&nbsp;had to be halted&nbsp;just days after shooting on the film had resumed because star Robert Pattinson had also tested positive for the virus. The latter announcement comes just a little over a week after&nbsp;DC FanDome, when Reeves unveiled the new trailer for the film and offered fans the first look of Pattinson in action as the character. It remains to be seen how long the delay will be, but it serves as a reminder to the rest of us that nobody is above the pandemic. So&nbsp;please stay vigilant, stay safe, and practice social distancing protocols, so we can all enjoy&nbsp;The Batman together.8. HOLLYWOOD RESPONDS TO DEATH OF CHADWICK BOSEMAN(Photo by Marvel Studios)Last Friday, the world was stunned to learn that Chadwick Boseman, the actor who had portrayed such real-life luminaries as James Brown, Jackie Robinson, and Thurgood Marshall, as well as the Marvel superhero Black Panther, had succumbed to the colon cancer he had been battling since 2016. Part of the shock came because of what he represented to movie fans, but also because no one — not even those he worked closely with — was aware of his condition, even as he churned out critically acclaimed hits and record-breaking blockbusters. News of his death, as reported by his family on Twitter, resonated powerfully with fans, which resulted in an outpouring of emotion and inspired a number of tributes. In the wake of the announcement, the film&nbsp;Black Panther shot to the top of charts on Amazon and iTunes, while ABC aired the film on Sunday along with a tribute to Boseman anchored by Robin Roberts and TBS made space in its schedule to air the film twice. AMC theaters also decided to rerelease the Jackie Robinson biopic&nbsp;42 in theaters, beginning this weekend, and after just one day, the tweet announcing his death became the most liked tweet ever. Boseman clearly had a massive impact on the world, and he will be sorely missed.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"child's","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/04124302/Adam_Driver-Quiet_Place-Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"adam-driver-joins-new-film-from-the-writers-of-a-quiet-place-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509170064593","title":"Jared Leto to star in TRON: Ares, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jared Leto to star in TRON: Ares, and More Movie NewsThe animated reimagining of Blazing Saddles is back on, and new projects for Elisabeth Moss, Ben Affleck (as director), Lulu Wang, Madonna, Jason Bateman, and more.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 14, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Star Trek, Swan Lake, and TRON: Ares.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJARED LETO TO STAR IN&nbsp;TRON: ARES(Photo by Derek Storm/Everett Collection)It’s now been ten years since the release of the long-in-development sequel TRON: Legacy (Rotten at 51%), which was perceived by some as a box office disappointment, despite actually earning over $400 million worldwide. That sequel came about 28 years after the first TRON, but it looks like the gap between 2 and 3 will be a lot shorter. That’s because Disney is moving ahead with a third TRON movie, which will be directed by Garth Davis (Lion, Mary Magdalene). Original TRON star Jeff Bridges returned for TRON: Legacy, along with newcomer Garrett Hedlund, but it appears that the star of this third TRON movie will be Jared Leto (though it’s also possible others will return as well). Although plenty of what Disney makes these days is for Disney+, it sounds like this new TRON is indeed planned for a theatrical release (presuming the pandemic ends soon). We also learned this week, via Jared Leto’s Twitter, that the title will be TRON: Ares, which is a reference to the Greek god of war&nbsp; — maybe this is the name of Jared Leto’s character, or maybe it’s a God of War or Assassin’s Creed-style game that is the new film’s in-game setting. In related news, Jared Leto also confirmed on his Instagram this week that he is attached to star in an upcoming movie as famous “pop art” superstar Andy Warhol, although it’s unclear what movie that might be (an Andy Warhol biopic was announced in 2016, but not much has been heard of it since).Other Top Headlines1. ELISABETH MOSS AND&nbsp;BLUMHOUSE&nbsp;REUNITE FOR MRS. MARCH(Photo by Mark Rogers/©Universal Pictures)Most of 2020 is completely “borked” when it comes to box office numbers because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but one of the year’s (relative) successes happened just before theaters shut down. Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions released their reimagining of the classic monster movie The Invisible Man (Certified Fresh at 91%), starring Elisabeth Moss, on February 28, earning $130 million worldwide (a number impacted by the shutdowns in March) before pivoting to a premium VOD release. Elisabeth Moss and her Love and Squalor Pictures production company are partnering again with Blumhouse on a psychological thriller called Mrs. March, in which Moss will also star. Mrs. March will be an adaptation of an upcoming novel by Virginia Feito about an “a polished Upper East Side housewife who unravels when she begins to suspect the detestable protagonist of her husband’s latest bestselling novel is based on her.” Moss said in a statement, “I read Virginia’s novel in one sitting and was so captured by it I knew I had to make it and play Mrs. March. As a character, she is fascinating, complex, and deeply human and I can’t wait to sink my teeth into her.”2. BEN AFFLECK RETURNING AS DIRECTOR FOR CHINATOWN TELL-ALL(Photo by Universal Pictures)It has now been eight years since Ben Affleck directed the fact-based Argo (Certified Fresh at 96%), which went on earn multiple awards including three Oscars&nbsp;(Best Picture, Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay). In the time since (partly because his role as Batman took up much of his time), Affleck has only directed one movie, Live by Night, which gave him his first Rotten score&nbsp;as director at 35% on the Tomatometer. This week, possibly hoping to attract the same critical acclaim that&nbsp;Argo earned,&nbsp;Affleck signed on with Paramount Pictures to direct another movie based on a true story in the 1970s. The movie is called The Big Goodbye, and it’s described as a “behind the scenes” depiction of the 1974 neo-noir drama Chinatown (Certified Fresh at 99%),&nbsp;directed by Roman Polanski and starring Jack Nicholson. The source material is the recent non-fiction book by author Sam Wasson, The Big Goodbye: Chinatown and the Last Years of Hollywood. Affleck will also adapt the screenplay, and one of his producing partners will be Saturday Night Live showrunner Lorne Michaels. This deal comes in the year after both the death of former Paramount executive Robert Evans and the release of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood (Certified Fresh at 85%), in which director Roman Polanski was a character.3.&nbsp;THE CLASSIC&nbsp;STAR TREK EPISODE THAT INSPIRED QUENTIN TARANTINO’S PROJECT(Photo by Francois Duhamel/©Weinstein Company courtesy Everett Collection)Speaking of Paramount Pictures, the studio has a new boss in Emma Watts, and Deadline reported this week&nbsp;that one of her top priorities is getting the Star Trek movie franchise going again. Watts, however, is also reportedly “in the process of figuring out which way to go,” and&nbsp;to that end, Paramount has put the brakes on the new Star Trek movie being produced by TV showrunner Noah Hawley (Fargo, Legion). Two other projects Paramount is still developing, however, are a time travel story involving Chris Hemsworth as Captain Kirk’s father in an alternate reality and Quentin Tarantino’s project. We also learned this week that Tarantino’s project reportedly involves “30s gangster(s),” which suggests that the classic episode Tarantino was inspired by was “A Piece of the Action,” which was set on a planet&nbsp;that adapted its culture based on Chicago in the 1920s. Within the context of Tarantino’s career, it sort of makes perfect sense that he would want to work on a Star Trek movie that references gangster flicks, as that’s a classic Hollywood genre&nbsp;he hasn’t yet paid homage to (a la war movies in Inglourious Basterds, westerns in Django Unchained, and martial arts movies in Kill Bill Vol. 1).4. LULU WANG’S NEXT FILM INSPIRED BY 2013 FILM&nbsp;LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Every once in a while in our social media world, you might see someone’s reaction to a story before you see the original story. This week, for example, this Tweet from director Lulu Wang (The Farewell, Certified Fresh at 98%) in which she says, “I don’t believe in remakes” without providing any context appeared in many people’s feeds. What Wang was responding to&nbsp;were various trade stories that she is developing a film based on award-winning&nbsp;Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda’s 2013 film, Like Father, Like Son ( Certified Fresh at 87% ), many of which first used the word “remake” before changing it later to “inspired by,” etc. There are, of course, many ways in which a film can be inspired by, or even “based upon,” another film without being a direct adaptation (for example, George Lucas “loosely” based Star Wars upon Akira Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress). The original Like Father, Like Son was about a couple who discover that their son was switched at birth, and the way they decide to address this new revelation. Lulu Wang could take that premise and do all sort of different things with it (including, for example, gender swapping so it’s actually about a daughter).5. QUEEN LATIFAH AND JAMIE FOXX PRODUCING GOSPEL BIOPIC STARRING JILL SCOTT(Photo by Everett Collection)Jamie Foxx won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his depiction of musician Ray Charles in 2004’s Ray (Certified Fresh at 80%). Then, in 2015, Queen Latifah starred in the HBO biopic Bessie (Certified Fresh at 90%) as early blues singer Bessie Smith, which won four Emmy awards for HBO. Together, they are now teaming up to produce Mahalia!, based upon the life of gospel singer Mahalia Jackson (1911-1972). Grammy-winning singer Jill Scott is already attached to star&nbsp;in the film,&nbsp;which is based on the novel Mahalia Jackson by Darlene Donloe. Mahalia Jackson was reportedly an inspiration for both Aretha Franklin and for Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. Incidentally, the Lifetime cable channel is also developing a Mahalia Jackson TV movie biopic.6. MADONNA NOT-SO-SECRETLY WORKING ON SECRET PROJECT WITH DIABLO CODY(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)As we’ve mentioned several times in this column, musical biopics are all the rage right now; upcoming projects include Aretha Franklin and Respect, Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis Presley project, I Wanna Dance With Somebody about Whitney Houston, and a Prince movie, not to mention the Mahalia Jackson movie mentioned just above. One of the biggest stars who has not yet ever been attached to a movie like this is Madonna, but this week, the singer teased at “something” via her Instagram account, where she posted a black and white video of her sitting on a couch with screenwriter Diablo Cody, apparently discussing an upcoming project, along with the text: “with multiple injuries what do you do? Write a screenplay with Diablo Cody.” Now, we don’t actually know anything more than that, but Cody has worked on a number of films, most notably with director Jason Reitman on 2018’s&nbsp;Tully (Certified Fresh at 87%), 2011’s&nbsp;Young Adult (Certified Fresh at 80%), and&nbsp;2007’s Juno (Certified Fresh at 94%), for which she won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (she was also nominated for Young Adult). Madonna later followed her post with a video with musical emojis suggesting that whatever this project is, it somehow involves music (possibly Madonna’s own?).7. ANIMATED BLAZING SADDLES SPOOF BLAZING SAMURAI BACK IN DEVELOPMENT(Photo by Everett Collection)Movies sometimes take a long time to actually get made. For example, recent films like The Meg and Gemini Man actually both started development in the early 2000s, but didn’t get produced and released until over 15 years later. Animated movies don’t usually stew in development quite as long, but their actual production times can take much longer. Back in 2015, we first started to hear about an animated comedy called Blazing Samurai, which would feature the voices of stars like Samuel L. Jackson, Ricky Gervais, Mel Brooks, Michael Cera, and George Takei. As the title and Mel Brooks’ involvement would suggest, Blazing Samurai is inspired by Brooks’ classic 1974 cowboy satire&nbsp;Blazing Saddles (Certified Fresh at 88%), but no doubt softened up for kids. (In related news, HBO Max this week added an opening warning&nbsp;to Blazing Saddles to address the racial jokes throughout the film.) Five years later, it was starting to look like&nbsp;Blazing Samurai had been abandoned, but the project is back in active production now with a budget of $46 million and an estimated completion date of late summer, 2021. Michael Cera voices a “a loveable mutt with big dreams of becoming a Samurai. When he finds himself with a new job as sheriff of Kakamucho, he also finds he may have bitten off more than he can chew given the town is inhabited solely by cats.”8.&nbsp;FELICITY JONES TO STAR IN SWAN LAKE BALLET ADAPTATION(Photo by Jonathan Olley/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Lucasfilm Ltd.)Following the success of The Invisible Man, Universal Pictures has several plans to revive their classic Universal monsters, but they are not the only “classical” reboots the studio is developing. It was confirmed this week that Universal is also developing a movie called Swan Lake, based upon the famous Tchaikovsky ballet. Possibly best known in recent years for being the inspiration for Darren Aronofsky’s Black Swan (Certified Fresh at 85%), Swan Lake is the story of a princess turned into a swan by an evil curse. Felicity Jones, who earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her role as Jane Hawking in 2014’s&nbsp;The Theory of Everything (Certified Fresh at 80%)&nbsp;and starred in&nbsp;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (Certified Fresh at 84%), is attached to star in&nbsp;Swan Lake, which is now being adapted by screenwriter Jessica Swale, who recently made her directorial debut with Summerland ( Certified Fresh at 76%).9. JASON BATEMAN AND GAME NIGHT WRITE REUNITE FOR SUPERHERO COMEDY(Photo by Hopper Stone/©Warner Bros.)The 2018 comedy Game Night (Certified Fresh at 84%), starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, may have been something of a sleeper hit, earning over $117 million worldwide. Now, Bateman and Game Night screenwriter Mark Perez are preparing to reunite for another action comedy, this time with possibly a more ambitious premise and budget. That movie is called Superworld, and it’s an adaptation of a recent novel by author Gus Krieger. Superworld will be set in the near future of 2038 when every person on planet Earth now has superpowers, except one man (Jason Bateman), who gets his chance to prove himself when he takes on “a corporate overlord whose power is neutralizing anyone with a superpower.”","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/14162107/Jared_Leto_Tron-Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"jared-leto-to-star-in-tron-ares-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509170058448","title":"Olivia Wilde Might Be Directing a Spider-Woman Movie, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Olivia Wilde Might Be Directing a Spider-Woman Movie, and More NewsWill Smith and Kevin Hart remake an '80s classic, Gaga gets impressive co-stars, Kraven the Hunter gets a movie, and Bjork joins Robbert Eggers' viking epic.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 21, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as The Flash, Kraven the Hunter, and Gucci.This WEEK’S TOP STORYOLIVIA WILDE MIGHT BE DIRECTING A&nbsp;SPIDER-WOMAN MOVIE FOR SONY(Photo by Francois Duhamel/©Annapurna Pictures)Although “SPUMC” is a pretty clumsy abbreviation, Sony Pictures does indeed have a massive “Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters” slate planned. In addition to Venom and the upcoming Morbius (3/19/2021, delayed from 7/10/2021 because of COVID-19), the SPUMC development slate currently includes: Jackpot, Kraven the Hunter (see story below), Madame Web, Nightwatch, Silk, and The Sinister Six. One of the most talked about stories of the week was the announcement that Sony Pictures has officially hired actress-turned-director Olivia Wilde for an “untitled female-centric Marvel movie.” Most of the stories about Wilde’s hiring speculate that the secret project is probably Spider-Woman, A.K.A.&nbsp;Jessica Drew, who debuted in the comics in 1977, before soon after getting her own Saturday morning cartoon (which you can now watch on Disney+). It’s also possible that Olivia Wilde’s project could be about another “Spider” woman hero, like Silk, Ghost-Spider (A.K.A. Spider-Gwen), Madame Web, or someone never mentioned for a movie before like Spider-Girl or Araña (Peter Parker has got a lot of female counterparts). Olivia Wilde’s next project as director will be a thriller called Don’t Worry Darling, starring Florence Pugh, Dakota Johnson, Shia LaBeouf, and Chris Pine.Other Top Headlines1. THE FLASH&nbsp;WILL PROMINENTLY FEATURE TWO FORMER BATMEN(Photo by ©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)We’ve known for some time that the long planned DC Comics solo movie for The Flash (starring Ezra Miller from Justice League) is likely to involve the popular Flashpoint storyline,&nbsp;in which The Flash’s attempt to change the past results in all sorts of “alternate reality” craziness. There have been recent rumors that The Flash could feature past Batman actors like Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck, but this week, we appeared to receive confirmation that both of them will indeed return as their versions of Batman. Let’s start with Ben Affleck, who at one point appeared to be “done” with playing Batman, especially when Twilight star Robert Pattinson signed on to star in the long-in-development The Batman (10/1/2021), which at one point was supposed to have starred Affleck. Affleck reportedly had “notes on the script” before he agreed to sign on to return&nbsp;in The Flash. (You can read much more speculation about the possible impact of this&nbsp; right here). As we said earlier, Affleck won’t be the only returning Batman, as Michael Keaton from the original 1989 Batman will also be coming back, in what is now being called a “substantial” role, versus what had previously been thought to just be a cameo of some sort. Although the COVID-19 pandemic obviously continues to have an impact on release dates, The Flash is currently scheduled for release on June 2, 2022.2. WILL SMITH AND KEVIN HART BOARD THE PLANES, TRAINS, &amp; AUTOMOBILES REMAKE(Photo by Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)Despite the ongoing love affair with 1980s movies, and the wave of remakes of 1980s movies, one of the most beloved directors of the 1980s — John Hughes — has basically been left untouched (Hughes wrote, but didn’t direct, the original Vacation, which was remade in 2015). That will likely soon change, as Paramount Pictures is now actively developing a remake of the 1987 classic Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles (Certified Fresh at 91%), starring Steve Martin and John Candy as fellow travelers who face a series of obstacles in their attempts to get home for Thanksgiving. The new&nbsp;Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles&nbsp;is being developed for Paramount&nbsp;by Will Smith’s Westbrook Studios and Kevin Hart’s Hartbeat Productions as a star vehicle for both of them. It’s unconfirmed which star will be reprising which role, but&nbsp;our money is on&nbsp;Smith&nbsp;to play the harried family man and Kevin Hart to play the sad-sack loner. Television writer Aeysha Carr (Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Fresh at 95%) has been hired to make her feature film debut adapting the film.3. LADY GAGA’S GUCCI MAY BE JOINED BY DE NIRO, PACINO, DRIVER, AND LETO(Photo by ©Netflix)Some movies seem to be intended from their very inception as possible awards contenders, and from the day we first heard about Ridley Scott’s Gucci, starring Lady Gaga as Patricia Reggiani, it seemed like exactly that sort of film. Having said that, there’s “Oscar bait” and then there’s OSCAR BAIT, and you don’t get much more Oscar Baity than the casting coup Scott was able to manage this week. In addition to Lady Gaga’s three nominations and one Academy Award, and Ridley Scott’s four Academy Award nominations, the actors cast in Gucci this week have received a total of four Academy Award wins (for The Godfather Part II, Raging Bull, Scent of a Woman, and Dallas Buyers Club) and a grand total of twenty Academy Award acting nominations. The actors in question&nbsp;are Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Jared Leto, and Adam Driver (who’s no slouch either, with nominations for both BlackKklansman and Marriage Story). Boardwalk Empire star Jack Huston and Broadway star Reeve Carney are also in talks for roles. If both De Niro and Pacino do sign on for Gucci, it will be their fifth film acting together, following The Godfather Part II, Heat, Righteous Kill, and The Irishman. MGM currently has Gucci scheduled for release on November 24, 2021.4. THE MANDALORIAN STAR PEDRO PASCAL TO OBSESS OVER NICOLAS CAGE(Photo by Eli Winston/Everett Collection)One of the most fun movie news stories of 2019 came in November (just before we entered the trainwreck that is 2020) when we first heard about The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, in which Nicolas Cage&nbsp;will play a fictionalized version of himself. This week, we learned that Cage’s co-star will be Pedro Pascal, who is coming off the Disney+ hit The Mandalorian&nbsp;and is scheduled to appear as villain Maxwell Lord in the upcoming&nbsp;Wonder Woman 1984. Pascal’s casting brings with it a better understanding of exactly what this movie will be about. Nicolas Cage will play “a washed up, unfulfilled, and financially impaired version of himself” who agrees to attend a birthday party of a super fan (Pedro Pascal) for a million dollars. The party soon turns “dangerously obsessive” as Cage must “must stay alive by recreating his most beloved moments as an actor.” (Keep in mind that this is the same guy who ate a cockroach for Vampire’s Kiss). We&nbsp;have yet to learn if any bees will be involved.5. SPIDER-MAN VILLAIN KRAVEN THE HUNTER TO RECEIVE HIS OWN MOVIE(Photo by Marvel Comics)The news about the possible Spider-Woman movie sort of absorbed most of the Marvel movie attention this week, but there was actually major movement for another film to be set in the “Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters” (SPUMC).&nbsp;To start off, we should note that earlier this month, there was a rumor that Sony and Marvel were seeking a “Joel-Kinnaman-type” for Tom Holland’s third Spider-Man movie, which many interpreted as being for the role of old school Spidey villain Kraven the Hunter&nbsp;(also one of Spider-Man’s few classic villains who hasn’t yet been depicted in a live-action movie). We still don’t know if there are any plans to introduce Kraven in the next Spider-Man, but we do know that Sony is now developing a Kraven the Hunter movie, as the studio is now in talks with director J.C. Chandor (A Most Violent Year, Triple Frontier). Kraven the Hunter dates all the way back to 1964 and The Amazing Spider-Man #15, but the arguably definitive Kraven story arc is 1987’s Kraven’s Last Hunt&nbsp;(which may be part of the inspiration for the Kraven the Hunter movie as well). We should also note that there has been talk about Sony developing a Kraven the Hunter movie at least as far back as 2017 (along with Mysterio, who eventually made his debut in last year’s Spider-Man: Far from Home, played by Jake Gyllenhaal).6. PETE DAVIDSON AND O’SHEA JACKSON JR. TO TAKE ON SNEAKER CULTURE(Photo by ©NEON, Mary Cybulski/©Universal Pictures)In addition to the aforementioned Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles remake, Kevin Hart’s HartBeat Production also made the news this week for partnering with NBA star Chris Paul of the Oklahoma City Thunder for a dramedy called American Sole. Pete Davidson (Saturday Night Live, The King of Staten Island) and O’Shea Jackson Jr.&nbsp;(Straight Outta Compton, and also Ice Cube’s son)&nbsp;are both attached to star in American Sole, which is set in the world of “after-market sneakers” as two college graduates who attempt to get out of debt by getting into the lucrative market of reselling sneakers for much higher markups (which reportedly is now estimated to be worth over $2 billion in sales each year). Camila Mendes, who plays Veronica Lodge on The CW’s Riverdale, also joined American Sole this week as the girlfriend of Pete Davidson’s character.7. BJORK JOINS ROBERT EGGERS’ VIKING EPIC THE NORTHMAN(Photo by Ronald Siemoneit/Getty Images)The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed all aspects of filmmaking, both in and out of Hollywood, but one of the more obvious examples is the Vikings epic The Northman, which had to shut down just a week before production was to start in March. This week, director Robert Eggers (The Witch, The Lighthouse) was finally able to start principal production of The Northman on the elaborate sets that have been assembled in rural Ireland. Most of the epic’s cast had already been announced months ago, including Eggers’ The Lighthouse star Willem Dafoe, Anya Taylor-Joy from The Witch, Nicole Kidman, and brothers Alexander Skarsgård (HBO’s True Blood) and Bill Skarsgård (Pennywise from IT). The new addition this week was Icelandic pop star Bjork, who is reportedly playing a character called “The Slav Witch,” which… sort of makes sense (Bjork actually made her feature film debut 30 years ago in 1990 with the Icelandic witchcraft fairy tale The Juniper Tree).8. LAURENCE FISHBURNE SAYS HE WASN’T ASKED TO COME BACK FOR THE MATRIX 4(Photo by ©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)There is an expression in comic book fandom that goes, “No one stays dead except Uncle Ben” (humorously, that saying used to include Bucky Barnes and Jason Todd, until they both got revived). The trope about dead characters eventually coming back for financial reasons also applies frequently to the movies (like, say, the slasher villains in the Halloween and Friday the 13th franchises). So, one might have thought that Laurence Fishburne could be brought back as Morpheus in The Matrix 4, but this week, Fishburne clarified, “I have not been invited.” Also this week, Keanu Reeves spoke to press about the safety protocols on The Matrix 4 as production has resumed on sets in Germany. Filming had begun in February in San Francisco until moving on briefly to Berlin, but as with most film projects at the time, production of The Matrix 4 was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Keanu Reeves’ fellow cast members will include&nbsp;Carrie-Anne Moss and Jada Pinkett Smith (from the original trilogy) and newcomers Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (rumored to be playing the young Morpheus), Priyanka Chopra Jones, and Neil Patrick Harris. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to regularly cause release date changes, but for now, The Matrix 4 is scheduled for April 1st, 2022.9. POTENTIAL NEW GHOSTFACE VICTIMS ANNOUNCED FOR SCREAM 5(Photo by Dimension Films courtesy Everett Collection)In March of this year, we first learned that the directors and producers of last year’s horror comedy Ready or Not (Certified Fresh at 88%)&nbsp;had signed on to direct the long-awaited sequel&nbsp;Scream 5. For the most part, casting until this week mostly involved the announcements of returning franchise stars Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, David Arquette as Dewey Riley, and Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers-Riley. This week, two different young actresses were announced, starting with Melissa Barrera, who will be one of the stars of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s&nbsp;In the Heights when that movie is eventually released in 2021 (delayed from this summer). Two days later, Jane the Virigin co-star Jenna Ortega also joined the cast. In related (and unsurprising) news, Samara Weaving also revealed this week that there had been a moment this year when she almost was cast by her Ready or Not collaborators in Scream 5, saying, “We were talking about it, but our schedules aren’t gonna work, which is a bummer.” Scream 5 is expected to be released sometime in 2021 (probably later in the year), and filming&nbsp;is expected to start in Wilmington, North Carolina, later this year.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"ABC, New, Sundance, bad, school, Character, movies, drama, twilight, Access","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/21170911/Olivia_Wilde-Ketchup-Rep.jpg","slug":"olivia-wilde-might-be-directing-a-spider-woman-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509171723478","title":"Jason Momoa Is Frosty the Snowman, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jason Momoa Is Frosty the Snowman, and More Movie NewsThe Academy adds a slew of new members, Taika Waitit shepherds a trio of new films, Will Smith and Apple set a record, and new projects for Kate Winslet, Zachary Levi, and Pedro Almodóvar and Penelope Cruz.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 2, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Frosty the Snowman, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJASON MOMOA&nbsp;IS WARNER BROS.’&nbsp;FROSTY THE SNOWMAN(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)The “studio system” of the Golden Age of Hollywood has obviously been dead and gone for decades, but that doesn’t mean certain actors don’t establish relationships with specific studios. One of the studios best known for that is Warner Bros., which is frequently the home for movies starring Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Tom Cruise, Clint Eastwood, Michael B. Jordan, and of course, the various stars of their DC Comics superhero movies. That last group is important this week, because the star who gave Warner Bros. a massive box office success with Aquaman (Fresh at 65%)&nbsp;was Jason Momoa, who also co-starred in WB-sister-company HBO’s Game of Thrones. Momoa kept his relationship with Warner Bros. very, very cool this week by signing on to voice&nbsp;the classic Christmas character Frosty the Snowman in a new live-action/CGI hybrid movie (Frosty himself will be CGI with Momoa’s voice, of course). Momoa will also produce Frosty the Snowman along with DC Comics’ Geoff Johns.&nbsp;He’ll next be seen in the reboot of Frank Herbert’s Dune, which, likewise, will also be distributed by Warner Bros.Other Top Headlines1. THE ACADEMY’S NEW CLASS OF VOTERS INCLUDES AWKAFINA, FLORENCE PUGH, AND ZENDAYA(Photo by Getty Images)The Academy Awards are still recovering from the stigma reflected in the various #OscarsSoWhite hashtags of recent years, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is likewise continuing to implement changes designed to encourage diversity in the prestige films nominated and awarded each year. There were two different changes this week that both related to who precisely gets to vote each year on the nominees and winners. On Monday, the Board of Governors announced that they had reclassified the membership status of Artist’s Representatives (A.K.A. talent agents) from associates to members-at-large, which means that for the first time ever, 111 current agents will now have voting rights for the Oscars. The Academy has over 7,000 voting members, so those 111 votes are still a tiny minority, but the change is still significant and opens the door to other future changes, such as for critics or journalists. Then, on Tuesday, the Academy announced the names of the 819 artists who have been invited to join the Academy with full voting privileges. The list is made up of 45% women, 36% from minority backgrounds, and 49% are international artists from outside the United States. The newest Academy voters will include five of the stars of Parasite, Cynthia Erivo, Zazi Beetz, Constance Wu, Awkwafina, Florence Pugh, and Lakeith Stanfield, among many others.2. TAIKA WAITITI PRODUCING THREE PROJECTS FROM NEW ZEALAND MAORI WRITERS(Photo by Jasin Boland/©Marvel)Some directors are able to find a successful balance between big budget studio projects for “them” and then their own personal films for “me.” One such filmmaker is Taika Waititi, who directed Thor: Ragnarok (Certified Fresh at 93%) for Marvel Studios before moving on to his own pet project, Jojo Rabbit ( Certified Fresh at 80%). Waititi has lots of his own projects lined up (including the soccer movie Next Goal Wins, Thor: Love and Thunder, and a Star Wars movie), but this week, he also took on the role of producer in support of New Zealand. Waititi is producing three different projects from New Zealand writers of Maori heritage, with all three films looking at the effects of European colonization on the indigenous people of the country. The three projects will be The Imaginary Lives of James Poneke (about a Maori teenager who travels to 1840s London as part of a Maori museum exhibit), Down the Rabbit Hole (about a Maori woman who ends up in a British prison), and Better than Blood (about “an obsessive Maori detective as she hunts down an indigenous serial killer revenging the wrongs of New Zealand’s colonizers”).3. PEDRO ALMODOVAR AND PENELOPE CRUZ REUNITING FOR SEVENTH FILM(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)Although South Korea’s Parasite eventually won the Academy Award over it this year, Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar’s Pain and Glory (Certified Fresh at 96%) was still one of 2019’s most lauded films. For Pain and Glory, Almodóvar reunited with two of his most frequent (and most famous) co-stars: Antonio Banderas for the eighth time, and Penelope Cruz for the sixth time. We also now know that Almodóvar has once again cast Penelope Cruz for his next film, to be titled Madres Paralela (Parallel Mothers), which will reportedly tell the stories of two mothers (one of them being Cruz, who’s now 46) in Madrid who give birth to their babies on the same day, over the first two years of their new children’s lives. It’s not yet known if there is also a role in Madres Paralela for Anontio Banderas, or who might play the other mother. Madres Paralelas will start filming in Madrid in February, 2021, and it’s expected to be released in Spain by the end of that year (which suggests a release in the United States sometime in 2022).4. SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE 2 PRODUCER PROMISES IT WILL MAKE THE FIRST FILM LOOK “QUAINT”(Photo by ©Columbia Pictures)The animation style used for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (Certified Fresh at 97%) was so innovative that the film was able to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature that year against two Disney films (Pixar’s Incredibles 2 and Ralph Breaks the Internet). As amazing as it was, producer Chris Miller this week took to Twitter to tease&nbsp;that&nbsp;“The development of new groundbreaking art techniques being done for the next Spider-Verse movie are already blowing me away. It’s going to make the first movie look quaint.” Of course, that statement doesn’t go on to explain in what ways the sequel will be innovative (they certainly don’t want to tip off their competition). The sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (which hasn’t officially been titled yet) is currently scheduled for release over two years from now on October 7, 2022 (but that date could certainly be shifted as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to push release dates back).5. KATE WINSLET TO PORTRAY MODEL-TURNED-WAR CORRESPONDENT LEE MILLER(Photo by ©Warner Bros.)Back in 2015, Steven Spielberg made the news for developing a project&nbsp;called It’s What I Do, which would have starred Jennifer Lawrence as war photographer Lynsey Addario (that project appears to have stalled in the years since). This week, another biopic about a female war photographer is getting going, except that the setting for this one will be World War II. Kate Winslet is now attached to star&nbsp;in Lee, a biopic about Vogue model-turned-war-correspondent Lee Miller, who was on the scene for events like the London Blitz, the liberation of Paris from the Nazis, and the discoveries of the concentration camps at Buchenwald and Dachau. Lee will be the feature film directorial debut of cinematographer Ellen Kuras, whose work includes&nbsp;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (starring Winslet) and episodes of shows like Catch-22, Ozark, and The Umbrella Academy.6. WILL SMITH’S EMANCIPATION&nbsp;LANDS AT APPLE FOR $120 MILLION(Photo by Scott Garfield/©Netflix)Last year, Netflix ended up spending something north of $150 million on Martin Scorsese’s mob biopic The Irishman (Certified Fresh at 96%), and this week brought news of another expensive project being picked up by one of Netflix’s streaming competitors. The movie in question is the recently announced slavery-era epic Emancipation, in which Will Smith will star as the runaway slave “Peter” whose scarred back was photographed in 1863 to inspire the Northern public during the Civil War. Emancipation went up for sale at the Virtual Cannes market last week, leading to a sale to Apple for $120 million, which set an all-time record for the largest festival acquisition deal ever. Emancipation will be directed by Antoine Fuqua&nbsp;(Olympus Has Fallen, The Equalizer) and produced by Will Smith’s Westbrook Studios production company. Apple is expected to premiere Emancipation in theaters before it debuts on Apple TV+.7. SHAZAM! SUPERHERO ZACHARY LEVI TO STAR IN KURT WARNER FOOTBALL&nbsp;BIOPIC(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)One of the last movies to actually be released in theaters before the COVID-19 pandemic shut everything down for months (and delayed pretty much everything) was the faith-based romantic drama I Still Believe (Rotten at 51%), starring KJ Apa and Britt Robertson. This week, two different movies with direct connections to I Still Believe made the news. That film was directed by the sibling team of Andrew and Jon Erwin, and their next movie is going to be a football biopic called American Underdog: The Kurt Warner Story. The Erwin brothers were able to cast the star&nbsp;of one of 2019’s biggest superhero movies, as the title role of Kurt Warner will be played by &nbsp;Zachary Levi, who played the superhero alter ego in Shazam! (Certified Fresh at 90%). Levi will star as NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Kurt Warner,&nbsp;who “went from stocking shelves at a supermarket to becoming a Super Bowl MVP.” Also making the news this week is a project&nbsp;called Jesus Revolution, which is also based on a true story, this time about a group of California teenage hippies in the early 1970s who form their own religious movement called the Harvest Christian Fellowship. Jesus Revolution is being produced by the same people behind I Still Believe, and the cast will include Jim Gaffigan and Joel Courtney.8. SETH ROGEN BRINGING BACK ANIMATED TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES(Photo by ©Warner Bros.)It’s clear that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remains a popular franchise for many fans, whether their love of the characters started with the 1980s-1990s animated TV show, the 1990s live-action movies, or the gritty 1980s black-and-white comics that started it all. After those original three live live-action films in the 1990s, the first attempt at rebooting the franchise came in 2007 with the computer animated TMNT, which was then followed in 2014 by a live-action reboot&nbsp;that received a sequel in 2016 called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (Rotten at 37%). Now we can confirm that another attempt at reviving Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, specifically as a CGI-animated feature film,&nbsp;is in development, with Seth Rogen’s Point Grey Pictures teaming up with Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures on the project. This seventh Ninja Turtles movie will be directed by Jeff Rowe (a writer on Disney’s Gravity Falls who is making his directorial debut with Connected) working from a screenplay by Brendan O’Brien (co-writer of Neighbors, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising). It’s not yet known if Rogen himself plans on&nbsp;taking a role in the movie (Casey Jones, perhaps?).9. GERARD BUTLER CONFIRMS SEQUELS TO&nbsp;DEN OF THIEVES&nbsp;AND&nbsp;FALLEN FRANCHISE(Photo by Susie Allnutt/©Focus Features)If movie theaters do indeed open back up across the country by August, one of the first movies scheduled to be one of the first in wide release is Greenland, a Deep Impact-style disaster movie starring Gerard Butler. Although Greenland is an original story, Butler confirmed this week that that two of his upcoming projects will be sequels. One of them will be Den of Thieves 2: Pantera, a sequel to the 2018 heist action thriller Den of Thieves (Rotten at 42%)&nbsp;that earned $80 million worldwide. Butler describes the Den of Thieves sequel (about his character chasing O’Shea Jackson&nbsp; Jr.’s character around the world) as a “fun ride, spreading across North America into Europe and the diamond district of Marseilles.” Butler also promised that a fourth movie in the franchise that started in 2013 with Olympus Has Fallen (Rotten at 49%) is also in the works, although he didn’t mention a title or a location that will presumably have “fallen.” The second movie in 2016 was London Has Fallen (Rotten at 27%) and the third last year was Angel Has Fallen (Rotten at 39% ).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"all-time, on, Classic, comedy, Pacific, history, demand, Comic-Con, spanish, adaptation, theme","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/02154323/Jason_Momoa-Frosty_Snowman-Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"jason-momoa-is-frosty-the-snowman-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509171744987","title":"Henry Cavill May Be Superman Again, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Henry Cavill May Be Superman Again, and More NewsSonic the Hedgehog and Labyrinth get sequels, Apple snatches up Scorsese's Leo DiCaprio movie, Awkwafina and Karen Gillan team up again, and Fiddler on the Roof gets a remake.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 29, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you&nbsp;seven headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Fiddler on the Roof, Labyrinth 2, and Sonic the Hedgehog 2.This WEEK’S TOP STORYHENRY CAVILL IN TALKS TO RETURN AS SUPERMAN IN FUTURE DC MOVIES(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)Nearly two years ago, one of the biggest superhero stories of 2018 was the revelation that Henry Cavill was dropping out of talks with Warner Bros. for future appearances as their Superman (specifically, the movie he would have co-starred in would’ve been 2019’s Shazam!). Just a week after the announcement that Zack Snyder’s Justice League will debut on HBO Max in 2021 (speaking of which, the first image of Darkseid was revealed this week), Henry Cavill is now back in negotiations for further appearances as Superman after all. Similar to what might have been for Shazam!, the talks with Henry Cavill reportedly do not involve a Man of Steel sequel (or any other solo Superman movie), but would instead would be Superman appearances in other DC superhero movies. Which movie (or movies) this deal might involve have yet to be revealed, but the titles written about the most&nbsp;this week seem to be Aquaman 2 (starring Jason Momoa) and the Shazam! spinoff Black Adam (starring Dwayne Johnson). Some writers have also picked up on a possible similarity to how Marvel Studios has used the Incredible Hulk since Mark Ruffalo took over the role, with his Hulk appearing in other heroes’ movies but not his own (though in that example, it was because Universal still had the rights to any Hulk movie).Other Top Headlines1. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG SEQUEL CONFIRMED(Photo by ©Paramount Pictures)When a movie is a big hit, reporting on an announced sequel can seem like sort of a no-brainer, but Sonic the Hedgehog is not one of those movies, as its road to&nbsp;success was far from a foregone conclusion. It was just over a year ago that the world saw the film’s first trailer (with the original CGI character design for Sonic), which led to the release being delayed a few months while the character was redesigned to look more like he did in the Sega video game franchise. Sonic the Hedgehog eventually earned over $300 million globally&nbsp;(a number dinted a bit by the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic) and it was also a VOD hit, with Paramount currently reporting just under 2 million digital sales. With all of that hard work and good news under their belt, Paramount Pictures, Sega, and director Jeff Fowler are now officially starting development on a Sonic the Hedgehog sequel. The various Sonic&nbsp;video games have introduced a variety of supporting characters, including Knuckles the Echidna, Shadow the Hedgehog, and Tails the Fox, so it’s possible one (or all) of them could be introduced in the sequel.2. TOM CRUISE REUNITES WITH EDGE OF TOMORROW DIRECTOR FOR OUTER SPACE ADVENTURE(Photo by ©Universal Pictures)A few weeks ago, Tom Cruise was announced as the world’s first movie star to actually film a movie in outer space (at the International Space Station), and already the film has made its next step towards actual production. Cruise will be reuniting with director Doug Liman, with whom he has previously worked on both Edge of Tomorrow (Certified Fresh at 90%) and American Made (Certified Fresh at 86%) (and they’re both committed to an Edge of Tomorrow sequel). Cruise’s partners on the currently untitled project also include Elon Musk’s SpaceX and NASA itself. Tom Cruise and Doug Liman had previously been developing a movie called Lunar Park (about “renegade employees who venture to the moon to steal an energy source”), but this new project is reportedly a separate film. Doug Liman’s next film will be the post-apocalyptic Chaos Walking (starring Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley), and Tom Cruise’s next film will be the sequel Top Gun: Maverick, now scheduled for December 23, 2020.3. APPLE WINS AUCTION FOR MARTIN SCORSESE’S LEONARDO DICAPRIO MOVIE(Photo by ©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)One of the biggest surprises about last year’s The Irishman (Certified Fresh at 96%) was that Netflix ended up spending over $160 million on it, which is a number generally&nbsp;reserved for FX-heavy summer action flicks or superhero movies (to be fair,&nbsp;The Irishman was FX-heavy too, due to the CGI de-aging). For his next film, the 1920s serial killer true story Killers of the Flower Moon (starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro), director Martin Scorsese is expecting to exceed The Irishman, with a budget somewhere in the $180-$200 million range, and that recently prompted Paramount Pictures to start looking for a financial partner. Paramount did land a major streaming company, but instead of Netflix, this time around it’s Apple who stepped in, snatching up a deal&nbsp;that would give the streaming rights to Apple+ after a theatrical release by Paramount. This was the second major deal for Apple+ in the last ten days, following their acquisition earlier this month of Tom Hanks’ World War II film Greyhound, which previously was scheduled for a June 19, 2020 theatrical release.4. HAMILTON DIRECTOR REMAKING&nbsp;FIDDLER ON THE ROOF(Photo by Everett Collection)By 1971, classic Hollywood and especially old school musicals were definitely on the wane as “New Hollywood” was on the ascent, but there were still a few musicals in that tradition that became box office hits. One of those films was Fiddler on the Roof, the adaptation of the 1964 Broadway musical about a Jewish village just before the Russian Revolution.&nbsp;The original stage production&nbsp;won nine Tony Awards, and was the first longest-running play until Grease broke its record. Fiddler on the Roof also holds the distinction of being the movie that gave composer John Williams his first of five Academy Awards (before Jaws, Star Wars, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and Schindler’s List). With Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story remake (12/18/2020)&nbsp;wrapped and coming soon, MGM is now developing a Fiddler on the Roof remake to be directed by Thomas Kail, who directed the version of the Broadway hit Hamilton&nbsp;that will debut on Disney+ on July 3rd.5. JUMANJI&nbsp;CO-STARS AWKWAFINA AND KAREN GILLAN REUNITE IN NEW ACTION-COMEDY(Photo by RCF/Everett Collection, Karwai Tang/Getty Images)After co-starring in Ocean’s Eight and the first movie in the eventual Crazy Rich Asians franchise, Awkwafina added another franchise to her filmography in December with Jumanji: The Next Level (Fresh at 71%), sharing the screen with Karen Gillan. Now Awkwafina and Gillan are signed to co-star in another action movie&nbsp;called Shelly, about an “awkw”-ard young woman (Awkwafina) who grows up to become an assassin, only to discover that her next target is none other than her worst high school bully (Karen Gillan). Shelly&nbsp;is being called “a cross between Mean Girls and Bill Hader’s hitman series Barry.” Prolific TV sitcom director Jude Weng (Fresh Off the Boat, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend) is attached to make his feature film directorial debut with Shelly.6.&nbsp;LABYRINTH GETTING SEQUEL 30+ YEARS LATER FROM DOCTOR STRANGE DIRECTOR(Photo by (c)TriStar courtesy Everett Collection)One of the first surprising news stories of 2020 was the announcement that Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson (Sinister, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) had dropped out of directing the sequel Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (the job eventually went to Spider-Man director Sam Raimi instead). This week, Derrickson did sign on to develop another sequel to a popular and ambitious fantasy film, although the necessary development time probably means&nbsp;it&nbsp;won’t be his next project.&nbsp;The movie in question is a sequel to the 1986 musical fantasy Labyrinth (Fresh at 71%), featuring the young Jennifer Connelly and the late David Bowie as the Goblin King. The premise of the Labyrinth sequel isn’t yet known, including whether or not Connelly will be reprising her role. One possible story scenario could involve the children of either Connelly’s character or her younger brother (who was the baby kidnapped in Labyrinth). Brian Henson of the Jim Henson Company will executive produce this sequel to a film directed by his late father, Jim Henson.7. A QUIET PLACE PRODUCERS TAKE ON BLACK HOLE DISASTER FLICK(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Robotics engineer and best-selling author Daniel H. Wilson’s 2011 sci-fi novel Robopocalypse nearly made the transition from page to screen when none other than Steven Spielberg showed interest in tackling it, but the film has remained in limbo ever since DreamWorks put it on hold indefinitely after several production delays. In the meantime, Wilson has continued to write, and&nbsp;this week,&nbsp;he sold a spec script called The Blue Afternoon That Lasted Forever to Paramount Pictures. The screenplay tells the story of a NASA physicist who discovers the formation of a black hole that will destroy Earth in a few days, but he struggles to find anyone who believes his evidence or his theory. The Blue Afternoon That Lasted Forever is being developed by producers Andrew Form and Brad Fuller, who delivered a big hit for Paramount Pictures in 2018 with John Krasinski’s&nbsp;A Quiet Place (Certified Fresh at 95%) and also produce Amazon’s Jack Ryan, which stars Krasinski.8. NARCOS DIRECTOR WORKING WITH RIDLEY SCOTT ON PRISON THRILLER PANOPTICON(Photo by Giles Keyte/TM &amp; copyright ©20th Century Fox Film Corp.)There are only so many films that a single director can ever personally take on, and Ridley Scott certainly knows this, having had to part with dozens of projects over the years. Scott is also super active as a producer through his and his late brother Tony’s Scott Free production company. This fall, Scott Free Productions hopes to start filming an adaptation of the screenplay Panopticon, which first came to attention in 2017 as one of the entries on that year’s Black List of Unproduced Screenplays. Panopticon is described as a prison thriller “told from the perspectives of a new inmate, a correctional officer, and a Wall Street hotshot.” The news this week is that Panopticon will be the next feature film directed by Colombian filmmaker Andrés Baiz, whose previous work has included 12 episodes of the Netflix crime series Narcos (Fresh at 89%).9. UNIVERSAL LICENSES DARK MAGIC YOUNG ADULT NOVEL SCHOLOMANCE(Photo by ©Columbia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)One of the fun things about&nbsp;reporting on so many new movie projects every week is the occasional learning experience it provides. For example, until this week, this writer thought Scholomance was just one of the original World of Warcraft dungeons. As it turns out, The Scholomance&nbsp;comes from Transylvanian folklore and refers to&nbsp;a school of dark magic in the mountains of Transylvania; it has been featured in a few different interesting stories, including Bram Stoker’s&nbsp;Dracula. Scholomance is also the name of an upcoming fantasy book series by author Naomi Novik, who this week struck a deal with Universal Pictures for a potential film franchise. The first Scholomance novel to be adapted will be A Deadly Education, about “El Higgins, a girl with unmatched power who enters a school for the magically gifted, where failure means certain death.” Novik also wrote the Termeraire novel series about a world where dragons really exist, and for a while, it was was being developed as a possible new franchise for Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"thriller, shows, Returns, Valentine's, BET, Summer, Epix, of, Fresh, HBO, Shondaland","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/29154756/Henry-Cavill-Superman-BACK-IN-Ketchup-Rep.jpg","slug":"henry-cavill-may-be-superman-again-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509171741914","title":"Ryan Gosling Might Be Universal’s New Wolfman, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ryan Gosling Might Be Universal's New Wolfman, and More Movie NewsEveryone wants to work with John Boyega, J.K. Simmons confirms his return to Spider-Man, and Martin Scorsese downgrades Leo DiCpario's role in his next film.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 5, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you&nbsp;seven headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as the next Spider-Man&nbsp;movie and Wolfman.This WEEK’S TOP STORYUNIVERSAL WANTS RYAN GOSLING TO BE THEIR&nbsp;WOLFMAN(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Universal Pictures scrapped ambitious plans for a cinematic “Dark Universe” in 2017 following the luke warm reaction to Tom Cruise’s The Mummy (Rotten at 16%). Instead, this year’s The Invisible Man (Certified Fresh at 91%) became the first movie of another round of monster movie reboots. Some of the other projects are Paul Feig’s Dark Army and a remake of The Invisible Woman, but this week, we found out that the next&nbsp;one will probably be Wolfman. Although he’s not officially signed yet, Universal Pictures is “pushing ahead” with Wolfman with an eye toward Ryan Gosling to star. In much the same way&nbsp;The Invisible Man was reimagined as a “stalker thriller,” the Wolfman reboot is being compared to Jake Gyllenhaal’s Nightcrawler, which seems like an odd film to single out as a comparison to a movie about a guy who turns into a half-man/half-wolf. Wolfman is currently being written by the Orange is the New Black team of Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo based on a story idea from Gosling himself.Other Top Headlines1. PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE WANTS TO WORK WITH JOHN BOYEGA(Photo by Everett Collection)It’s not uncommon for Hollywood celebrities to voice their political opinions, and when they do, there are sometimes unintended consequences. Recent Star Wars alumnus John Boyega took to the streets in London this week&nbsp;for a Black Lives Matter protest in support of the movement against police brutality, which sparked up again dramatically following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis, MN on May 26. During an impassioned speech, Boyega acknowledged the risk inherent in an entertainment figure speaking out in such a manner, saying, “Look, I don’t know if I’m going to have a career after this, but&nbsp;f— that.” As it turned out, he didn’t have anything to worry about,&nbsp;because a deluge of support came in from Hollywood filmmakers eager to work with Boyega on future projects. The list includes Jordan Peele (Get Out, Us), who said, “We got you, John”; Chris Miller (The LEGO Movie); Lin-Manuel Miranda, who said, “Oh god I WISH”; Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz), who said, “Have before and would again”; Mike Flanagan (Doctor Sleep); Olivia Wilde (Booksmart), who said, “Absolutely”; Peyton Reed (Ant-Man), who said, “Anytime at all”; and also the official Star Wars Twitter account. Boyega’s next two films are likely to be an action thriller called Rebel Ridge and a legal drama called Naked Singularity, but it looks like he’ll have no shortage of options after that.2. J.K. SIMMONS CONFIRMS RETURN TO&nbsp;SPIDER-MAN(Photo by (c) Columbia courtesy Everett Collection)For the most part, the Spider-Man movies starring Andrew Garfield and now Tom Holland have gone their own way with casting the supporting characters. However, fans were surprised at the end of last year’s Spider-Man: Far from Home (Certified Fresh at 90%) to discover that Marvel Studios actually brought back J.K. Simmons&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;brief cameo&nbsp;as J. Jonah Jameson, the role he played Sam Raimi’s three Tobey Maguire-led&nbsp;Spider-Man films. The cameo seemed to tease a potential premise for Tom Holland’s third solo Spider-Man movie, and this week, Simmons confirmed that he is indeed signed to return for more Spider-Man sequels (note the plural there). There was, however, some doubt in his statement, because Simmons said, “I don’t know if I would use the word ‘expect'” when asked if fans can “expect” to see him in the next film. The next Spider-Man doesn’t have an official title (though it’s rumored to possibly be Spider-Man: Home Run), but it does have a release date scheduled for November 6, 2021 (pushed back four months from next July due to pandemic-related production delays).3. THE FIRST FEMALE STAR WARS DIRECTOR GETS READY TO&nbsp;KILL THEM ALL(Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images)As director J.J. Abrams was preparing to return for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (Rotten at 52%), one of his key creative decisions was to make history by hiring actress-turned-filmmaker Victoria Mahoney as his second unit director, making her the first ever woman to serve as a director on a&nbsp;Star Wars film. Mahoney is now signed with Paramount Pictures for what will be her first film as a director (not counting second unit, obviously) since her 2011 debut drama&nbsp;Yelling to the Sky, and it will be&nbsp;an action movie called Kill Them All.&nbsp; The screenplay by screenwriter James Coyne will be an adaptation of an Oni Press graphic novel&nbsp;described as “a love letter to 1990s action movies” about a “hard-drinking former cop who wants his job back” and a “betrayed murderess” who team up to take down a vicious Miami crime lord.4. SCORSESE HAS REWRITTEN DICAPRIO’S ROLE IN&nbsp;KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON(Photo by ©Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)For pretty much the entire&nbsp;time that Martin Scorsese has been developing his adaptation of the true crime novel Killers of the Flower Moon, about an early serial killer case investigated by the F.B.I.,&nbsp;he&nbsp;was planning on working with frequent collaborators Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. Along the way, we learned that De Niro was to play the serial killer, and that DiCaprio would be playing one of the lead F.B.I. agents investigating the case. Unfortunately, having Leonardo DiCaprio in a lead role may have led the film’s budget to balloon past $200 million. In an effort to keep that cost down, Scorsese has reportedly made changes to DiCaprio’s role, which will now instead be a villain (or anti-hero) who is a nephew of De Niro’s character&nbsp;and leaves the door open for another (cheaper) actor to play the federal agent. The revelations of these changes came out due to Apple taking over&nbsp;Killers of the Flower Moon from Paramount Pictures. Paramount will still release Killers of the Flower Moon theatrically, and then the film will move to Apple+ for streaming.5. TITO PUENTE BIOPIC NOW BEING DEVELOPED BY EDWARD JAMES OLMOS(Photo by Everett Collection)Thanks to the recent&nbsp;success of Bohemian Rhapsody (Fresh at 60%),&nbsp;Rocketman, and Judy, we’re currently in the midst of a mini-boom for musician biopics. The pandemic has obviously delayed film production and release, but two movies that will come out soon are the Aretha Franklin biopic Respect (starring Jennifer Hudson) (12/25/2020) and Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis Presley project (11/5/2021), while other musicians with biopics in development include the Bee Gees, Boy George, Whitney Houston, Bob Marley, and Amy Winehouse. Thanks to Edward James Olmos, we can also now add Tito Puente, the “King of Mambo,” to that list, as Olmos is now working with Puente’s family and estate on film and TV projects based on Puente’s life and legacy. Before his death in 2000 at the age of 77, Tito Puente had a 50+ year career that&nbsp;included six Grammy Awards (including a lifetime achievement award) as a mambo and Latin jazz musician, band leader, songwriter, and record producer. Puente’s most famous song was probably “Oye Como Va” (thanks in part to Santana also recording the song for their 1970 album Abraxas).6. MORBIUS&nbsp;DIRECTOR TAKING ON THE TRUE STORY OF THE EXECUTION(Photo by Jasin Boland/©Universal courtesy Everett Collection)Before the current pandemic caused industry-wide production delays, Sony’s adaptation of the Marvel Comics vampire character Morbius (starring Jared Leto) was to have been released next month on July 10, 2020 (it’s now scheduled for March 19, 2021). Morbius was directed by Daniel Espinosa (Child 44, Safe House), who this week entered into a deal to develop&nbsp;The Execution, which is described as “a narrative drama about the background to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi Arabian-born dissident and Washington Post columnist who was killed” in Istanbul in 2018. The true story behind The Execution will be adapted by screenwriter Petter Skavlan, who also worked on 2012’s Kon-Tiki (Certified Fresh at 81%), which was based on the true story of Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl’s expedition across the Pacific Ocean on a raft.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Fantasy, Writers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/05154315/Ryan_Gosling-Wolfman_Ketchup.jpg","slug":"ryan-gosling-might-be-universals-new-wolfman-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509173430498","title":"Rick and Morty Writer Hired for Ant-Man 3, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rick and Morty Writer Hired for Ant-Man 3, and More Movie NewsThe Batman won't be an origin story, The Others and The Night of the Hunter get remakes, and new projects for Lady Gaga, Jesse Eisenberg, and Fede Alvarez.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 10, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you&nbsp;seven headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Ant-Man 3, and remakes of The Others and The Night of the Hunter.This WEEK’S TOP STORYMARVEL’S ANT-MAN BETTER STOCK UP ON SZECHUAN SAUCE(Photo by Marvel Studios)One of the side effects of COVID-19 forcing (most of) the entire MCU schedule to shift back several months (starting with Black Widow moving to November 6, 2020) is that all of those movies are still in the works, so instead of there being four or five films being actively developed, we now have more like seven or eight&nbsp;going on at the same time. One of the&nbsp;furthest out (it doesn’t even have a release date yet) is Ant-Man 3, which is looking like it will come at least four years after the 2018 release of Ant-Man and the Wasp (Certified Fresh at 88%). With that in mind, this week Marvel hired its first writer for the project, namely Jeff Loveness, a writer and producer on the popular Rick and Morty animated cable show. There is no indication yet about what Ant-Man 3 might be about, except that Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily will both return as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Having said that, one could look at the comics and the seeds that previous Marvel movies have planted to guess that&nbsp;the third film&nbsp;could possibly introduce Scott Lang’s daughter Cassie as a new teen superhero called Stature. In the comics, Cassie Lang has been an active superhero since 2005, including stints in groups like the Young Avengers, the Mighty Avengers, and the Secret Avengers. And, like many superheroes,&nbsp;she has also “died,” but — this being comic books we’re talking about — she also eventually got better. In the MCU, Cassandra Lang was last seen in Avengers: Endgame, played by teen actress Emma Fuhrmann.Other Top Headlines1. THE BATMAN DIRECTOR PROMISES IT WON’T BE ANOTHER ORIGIN STORY(Photo by Mark Sagliocco/Getty Images)Ever since Robert Pattinson was announced as Bruce Wayne in next year’s The Batman (6/25/2021), there was some expectation that we would&nbsp;get yet another version&nbsp;of Batman’s origin story. This week, director Matt Reeves clarified the issue by specifically assuring that The Batman will not be another “origin tale,” although it will be “a tale that would still acknowledge his origins, in that it formed who he is. Like this guy, he’s majorly struggling, and this is how he’s trying to rise above that struggle.” As for how The Batman has been impacted by the recent production shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Reeves also revealed this week that they had “actually shot a quarter of the movie.” As with most currently stalled productions, there is no confirmed schedule for when Reeves and his cast will be able to get back together in London to continue filming, which means&nbsp;the film’s currently scheduled&nbsp;release date of June 25, 2021 could change.2. TAIKA WAITITI TEASES “SPACE SHARKS” IN&nbsp;THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER(Photo by Jasin Boland/©Marvel)A number of movie stars and directors are currently self-quarantined, as many of us are, but one small glimmer of fun in the midst of all this is that many of them are staging online events like “group watches” of various films. For example, Taika Waititi and his Thor: Ragnarok star Tessa Thompson staged a live watch&nbsp;of that film on Thursday, and in the process, Waititi dropped a few new details about what we can expect from Thor: Love and Thunder (2/18/2022). Calling the film “so over the top,” he also suggested that fans “look up space sharks” (likely a reference to “Starsharks“) and shared some of the new film’s concept art, including some new armor for Miek.3. LADY GAGA RETURNS TO ACTING IN&nbsp;FASHION EMPIRE EPIC&nbsp;GUCCI(Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/Getty Images)This coming October will mark two years since the release of Lady Gaga’s A Star is Born (Certified Fresh at 90%), and this week,&nbsp;her next big film got a little closer to happening. Lady Gaga is attached to star in the true crime drama Gucci about the murder of fashion icon Mauricio Gucci, playing&nbsp;Patrizia Reggiani, Gucci’s ex-wife “who was convicted of orchestrating his hit after he had an affair” (apologies if that that’s a spoiler, but it’s sort of how this entire story is being addressed in the news). Gucci is one of dozens of projects that Ridley Scott has been attached to in the last decade, but MGM coming aboard this week is being seen as&nbsp;an indication that&nbsp;Gucci&nbsp;will be one of Scott’s next projects, possibly right after The Last Duel, which will reunite Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, along with Adam Driver. Indeed, MGM has already given Gucci a release date of November 24, 2021, which has to be seen as rather ambitious, considering&nbsp;all the current delays in film production. That date is just 11 months after December 25, 2020, which is when The Last Duel is currently scheduled (though that could&nbsp;also potentially be pushed back).4.&nbsp;JESSE EISENBERG TO MAKE HIS DIRECTORIAL DEBUT BASED ON AN AUDIBLE ORIGINAL(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)With the long-in-development sequel Zombieland: Double Tap&nbsp;released last year, and with Warner Bros. unlikely to use his version of Lex Luthor again now that the Henry Cavill version of Man of Steel is likewise pretty much over, Jesse Eisenberg&nbsp;has a lot more time on his hands now. Heck, even the Rio movies are done. And so, as many actors of a certain caliber often do, Eisenberg is preparing to make his feature film directorial debut. That film will be called When You Finish Saving the World, and Eisenberg has recruited Julianne Moore and Finn Wolfhard (Mike from Stranger Things) to star in it. Moore and Wolfhard will play a mother and son in the drama adapted from an upcoming Audible Original recording of the same title. Jesse Eisenberg also voices a role in the Audible production, so he may have a role as well as being the film’s director.5.&nbsp;FEDE ALVAREZ TAKES&nbsp;ON ZOMBIE PANDEMIC THRILLER 16 STATES(Photo by Kirsty Griffin/©TriStar Pictures)As the world continues to struggle through an actual pandemic, one has to wonder how movies will tackle the subject. Diseases have frequently been an explanation in film for zombies (28 Days Later, for example, blamed it on a “rage virus”), and as of this week, we’re already getting a new movie about a zombie pandemic. Chilean director Fede Alvarez, who previously gave us both Don’t Breathe (Certified Fresh at 88%) and the 2013 Evil Dead remake (Fresh at 62%), has signed on with Lionsgate&nbsp;(the studio behind both of those films) for 16 States, about a mother who has to make her way back to her family who are stuck in the middle of a massive zombie outbreak. The 16 States screenplay has also been described as having “shades of the Will Smith movie, I Am Legend.”6. CHRISTOPH WALTZ WANTS TO RETURN FOR AN ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL SEQUEL(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Disney’s acquisition of the Fox film and TV properties has now been a done deal for over a year, but the projects that were in various stages&nbsp;of development are still left in sort of an odd state. (The New Mutants, for example, still hasn’t been released yet, two years after its original release date.)&nbsp;The last film to make it out of the former 20th Century Fox studios&nbsp;was Alita: Battle Angel (Fresh at 61%), the long-in-development adaptation of the 1990s manga and video game. It earned over $400 million worldwide, but its budget was also over $170 million, and while it&nbsp;seemed intended to start a new sci-fi franchise, there hasn’t been much news about a sequel since its release. Christoph Waltz, who basically had a “Gepetto”-style role, was asked this week about his interest in returning for&nbsp;a sequel, and he said that he hasn’t “heard anything and I’m a little disappointed and surprised that I haven’t heard a thing so far, because I know that it has followers. I know that people liked it, and aside from what others said, I loved it and I liked working on it and I liked the result.” This is far from news that Disney will ever want to move forward with an Alita: Battle Angel sequel, but at least one of their stars sounds like he’d love to return for more.7. HORROR FILM&nbsp;THE OTHERS&nbsp;IS GETTING MODERN REMAKE(Photo by Dimension Films)There is a strong argument to be made that 2001’s The Others (Certified Fresh at 83%) is a close-to-perfect claustrophobic ghost story that is only aging better because of its World War II setting. The Others worked despite hinging upon a “twist” ending at a time (the late 1990s into the early 2000s) when many horror or suspense films relied on them.&nbsp;One would think, therefore, that a story like The Others would be impossible to “remake,” since the twist is already out there for anyone who saw the original. Regardless, that’s exactly what is happening, as a modern retelling of The Others is now in development. The remake project’s producer, Renee Tab, said “It is almost eerie and uncanny how timely the themes are today: self-isolation, paranoia and fear, and of course the intense desire to protect our children and ourselves from harm.” One has to wonder if the remake will involve a mother keeping her children in the house due of fears of them catching an illness.8. UNIVERSAL’S REMAKE FEVER REACHES THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTERWhen Martin Scorsese remade 1962’s Cape Fear with Robert De Niro in 1991, he effectively raised that film’s profile as an intense thriller. The irony, however, is that Robert Mitchum’s performance as the baddie in Cape Fear was arguably a reprise of a similar role he played seven years earlier in The Night of the Hunter (Certified Fresh at 99%), actor Charles Laughton’s first and only feature film as director. (The Night of the Hunter also had an influence on Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing, which&nbsp;featured a character with “Love” and “Hate” on his hands.) Following their recent success with a modern remake of The Invisible Man (Certified Fresh at 91%), Universal Pictures is now developing a remake of The Night of the Hunter to be written by screenwriter Matt Orton (2018’s Operation Finale, Fresh at 60%). As with The Invisible Man, the story is expected to be set in the modern day.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"psychological, dramedy, Seed, deadpool, Thanksgiving, play, kaiju, Discovery, The, batman, Captain, based","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/10161036/Ant-Man_and_Wasp-Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"rick-and-morty-writer-hired-for-ant-man-3-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509171750109","title":"Luca Guadagnino Takes on Scarface Remake Written by Coen Brothers, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Luca Guadagnino Takes on Scarface Remake Written by Coen Brothers, and More Movie NewsAn animated Popeye is in development again, Buddy Holly gets a new biopic, and new roles for Cate Blanchett, Michael B.

So when Hollywood starts talking about remaking (or rebooting) a movie like Scarface, they’re really talking about remaking a remake. Universal Pictures has been trying to do just that with&nbsp;Scarface for several years now, including periods in when the setting might have shifted to take place within a Mexican or African-American crime world. We can now report that the latest director attached to Universal’s Scarface&nbsp;is Luca Guadagnino (Call Me By Your Name, Certified Fresh at 95%), who most recently directed another remake, Suspiria (Fresh at 65%),&nbsp;and who’s also developing a remake of Lord of the Flies. It’s unclear what Guadagnino’s plans for Scarface are, exactly, except that the film will focus on an “immigrant story” and be set in Los Angeles, and that he’ll be working off a screenplay recently rewritten by Joel and Ethan Coen.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;GEORGE MILLER EXPLAINS FURIOSA&nbsp;CASTING DECISION(Photo by Jasin Boland/©Warner Bros. Pictures)Although Australian director George Miller&nbsp;has been directing feature films for over 30 years (since the first Mad Max in 1979), his most recent film, 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road (Certified Fresh at 97%) was such an impressive breakthrough that,&nbsp;for the five years since, he’s left the world wondering what he’ll&nbsp;do next. We’ve known for a while now that his next film will be an epic romance called Three Thousand Years of Longing, and that Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton are attached to star. That film appeared to finally get close to a greenlight this week with the news that MGM has come aboard to distribute the project, which will be filmed on location in Australia, London, and Istanbul. As for the Fury Road prequel called Furiosa, this week Miller addressed his decision to cast the role with a younger actress instead of 44-year-old Charlize Theron, stating his concern that de-aging CGI hasn’t yet escaped the “uncanny valley” and citing last year’s The Irishman as an example of that. Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch, Emma., The New Mutants) has been mentioned as a possible Furiosa star, but no official casting announcement has been made yet.2. DANNY BOYLE TO DIRECT MICHAEL B. JORDAN IN&nbsp;METHUSELAH MAN(Photo by JA/Everett Collection)A recurring theme in this week’s news is that the directors of various 2019 movies are lining up their next films to be produced “some time” in the near future after the current COVID-19 crisis is somewhat alleviated. One of those directors is Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting), who last year gave us the Beatles-themed musical movie Yesterday (Fresh at 63%). Boyle’s new project this week is the long-in-development Methuselah Man, which in some way tells the story of a man who is over 900 years old (like the Biblical character). At one point, Tom Cruise was going to star in Methuselah Man, but the&nbsp;part now will be played by Michael B. Jordan (Creed, Black Panther). Danny Boyle’s frequent screenwriting partner Simon Beaufoy is expected to rewrite the script, although it’s still unknown what the premise exactly is. Whatever&nbsp;it&nbsp;is, Warner Bros. reportedly sees it as potentially the first film of a new franchise. Michael B. Jordan’s next film is expected to be the Tom Clancy adaptation Without Remorse, which is working its way through post-production as people work on it remotely.3.&nbsp;CATE BLANCHETT ADDS TWO MORE PROJECTS TO HER SCHEDULE(Photo by Lisa Tomasetti/©Sony Pictures Classics)Just last week, we reported that Cate Blanchett was the first acting talent to sign on for the video game adaptation Borderlands, even as her ambitious mini-series Mrs. America continues to air its final episodes on FX this month. Blanchett looks to stay busy, though, as she became attached to two more projects this week. Let’s start with Armageddon Times, which will be the next film&nbsp;from director James Gray, whose most recent film was last year’s Ad Astra (Certified Fresh at 84%). Armageddon Time was reportedly inspired by Gray’s time at the prestigious Kew-Forest School, where Fred Trump served on the school board, and which his son Donald Trump also attended. Cate Blanchett’s role in Armageddon Time hasn’t been confirmed yet. The other movie Blanchett signed on for this week is a Netflix sci-fi satire called Don’t Look Up with director Adam McKay (Vice, The Big Short, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy). Jennifer Lawrence will also co-star in the comedy about a team of astronomers on a media tour trying to warn the world that Earth is about to be hit by a world-destroying asteroid. We also don’t really know what Blanchett’s role&nbsp;Don’t Look Up&nbsp;will be.4. A NEW&nbsp;POPEYE MOVIE IS BACK IN DEVELOPMENTRussian-born animator and director&nbsp;Genndy Tartakovsky made the transition to feature films in 2012 with the first Hotel Transylvania after already achieving success on TV with shows like Dexter’s Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, and Samurai Jack. It was also in 2012 that Tartakovsky came on board a Sony Pictures Animation adaptation of the long-running cartoon character Popeye (the Sailor Man). That led to test footage debuting online in 2014, but then Sony Pictures pulled the plug on the project in 2015, and it seemed like Tartakovsky’s Popeye&nbsp;would never see the light of day. In a surprising (and rare) twist, the rights have reverted back from Sony to King Features, which has now greenlit the Popeye feature film, with Genndy Tartakovsky back on board to deliver his original vision from nearly 10 years ago. Sony Pictures is currently working on a Hotel Transylvania 4, but Tartakovsky won’t be directing that one.5. RUSSELL CROWE TO REMAKE A PROPHET AS AMERICAN SON(Photo by © Universal Pictures)The 2009 prison drama A Prophet (Certified Fresh at 97%) was France’s Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, in addition to earning&nbsp;dozens of other distinctions. An English language remake has been in development since 2016, at which point Sam Raimi was considering directing (he later dropped out). The remake is still going strong, however, under the new title American Son, with Russell Crowe now attached to star&nbsp;as a ruthless mobster who becomes a mentor for another prisoner who goes on to build his own syndicate. In the original film, control of the French prison was divided between Algerians and Corsicans, but that will obviously be changed for this remake&nbsp;directed by Andrew “Rapman” Onwubolu, whose directorial debut Blue Story was only recently released to widespread critical acclaim. Russell Crowe also made the news this week because his indie thriller Unhinged is now scheduled (7/1/2020) to be the first movie in theaters when they start reopening (if they reopen).6. DAKOTA JOHNSON JOINS OLIVIA WILDE’S NEW FILM(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Although the two stars of actress Olivia Wilde’s directorial debut, Booksmart, were relative newcomers (Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein), Wilde’s second film is going to feature some bigger stars. We learned a few weeks ago that Florence Pugh (Midsommar, Little Women) would be starring in Wilde’s Don’t Worry, Darling, with supporting roles going to Shia Labeouf, Chris Pine, and Wilde herself. This week, we can add&nbsp;Dakota Johnson, who is currently in talks for a role in the New Line Cinema psychological thriller. The details are being kept secret, except that the setting is an “isolated, utopian community” in the California desert of the 1950s (which makes this writer think of all sorts of scenarios, from The Stepford Wives to The Village to the Fallout video game franchise).7. DRIVING MISS DAISY DIRECTOR STEERING BUDDY HOLLY BIOPIC CLEAR LAKEDecades before the rock star biopic came back in a big way with Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman, relative newcomer Gary Busey starred in 1978’s&nbsp;The Buddy Holly Story (Fresh at 100%)&nbsp;as the doomed early rock-and-roller, for which Busey earned an Best Actor Academy Award nomination. A year later, Kurt Russell starred in the Elvis mini-series, and now, the two rock stars are again likely receiving movies within a year or two of each other (in this case, the “other” is Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis Presley project starring Austin Butler and Tom Hanks). Director Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy, Double Jeopardy) is now attached to direct a Buddy Holly biopic called Clear Lake, which will reportedly focus on Holly’s musical ties with African American stars of his day like Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials, Lavern Baker, and the recently late Little Richard. Clear Lake refers to the Iowa town near the site of the airplane crash that killed &nbsp;Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper.8.&nbsp;THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL’S&nbsp;RACHEL BROSNAHAN&nbsp;TO SWAP BODIES IN&nbsp;THE SWITCH(Photo by Nicole Rivelli/©Amazon)Hollywood has a long tradition of making movies and TV shows about “body swapping,”&nbsp;in which two characters take over each other’s bodies (a la Freaky Friday). The Switch is the title of a new movie (based on an upcoming novel of the same title) that basically takes that concept and imagines it as a real life experiment between a 29-year-old woman and her 79-year-old grandmother, who decide to live each other’s lives for two months. The granddaughter will be played by&nbsp;Rachel Brosnahan, the Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning star of Amazon’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, which was recently renewed for its fourth season. The Switch is being produced by Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners (Bridge of Spies, The Post), but the film does not yet have a director attached (Spielberg is extremely unlikely to direct, given his busy schedule).9.&nbsp;JOSH GAD IS THE FIRST TO BOARD THE ARMAGEDDON-STYLE ACTION MOVIE MOONFALL(Photo by © Hulu/Neon)Following the release of last year’s Midway, frequent disaster movie director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, 2012, The Day After Tomorrow) is now preparing to direct a movie called Moonfall. As the title suggests, Moonfall is an Armageddon-style action movie about a ragtag team brought together to rocket out to stop the Moon from crashing into the Earth. This week, Josh Gad became the first star to join&nbsp;what will be an ensemble cast as a character described as “odd and unkempt in a way that suggests a high level of intelligence and an equally high level of disorganization. He is a genius who correctly predicts that the moon has fallen out of its orbit, thus making the space-obsessed, profoundly unfiltered and eccentric man one of the most important people on Earth.” Gad will also soon appear in Artemis Fowl, which will debut on Disney+ on June 12, 2020.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Anna, curtis","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/15154426/Luca_Guadagnino-Scarface-Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"luca-guadagnino-takes-on-scarface-remake-written-by-coen-brothers-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509171748060","title":"GoT‘s Peter Dinklage and Jason Momoa Team Up for Vampire Movie, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})GoT's Peter Dinklage and Jason Momoa Team Up for Vampire Movie, and More NewsSony banks on obscure Marvel characters, Mindy Kaling will write Legally Blonde 3, Ryan Gosling returns to space, and Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead gets a remake.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 22, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you&nbsp;seven headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Methuselah Man,&nbsp;Moonfall, Popeye, and Scarface.This WEEK’S TOP STORYKHALEESI’S HAND AND HUSBAND TEAM UP FOR GOOD, BAD &amp; UNDEAD(Photo by RCF, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Increasingly, there are a handful of pop culture franchises that together account for the majority of movie stars (the MCU, the DCEU, etc.), and one of those is the cast of HBO’s Game of Thrones (especially for British and European actors). Two of the more prominent American stars of Game of Thrones were Jason Momoa (Khal Drogo) and Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), and this week, they both signed up for the same vampire movie called Good, Bad &amp; Undead. Dinklage will star as the latest in the long line of vampire hunters named Van Helsing, and Momoa will play a vampire who has vowed never to kill again. Teaming up, the two run a grift where they travel from town to town and Van Helsing pretends to defeat the vampire. Good, Bad, &amp; Undead will be directed by Max Barbakow, who made his feature film debut with the upcoming Andy Samberg comedy Palm Springs (Fresh at 100%).Other Top Headlines1. SONY’S OBSCURE MARVEL PLANS INCLUDE JACKPOT AND MADAME WEB(Photo by Bennett Raglin/Getty Images)In case you missed the news, earlier this month, it was confirmed that Sony Pictures is now using the awkward acronym SPUMC (Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters)&nbsp;to refer to its different projects based on Marvel Comics characters like Venom, Morbius, etc. It’s no “MCU,” but maybe it’ll grow on all of us. SPUMC refers to the hundreds of potential films that Sony retains the feature film rights to, most of which are characters that were first introduced in Spider-Man comic books. In addition to Venom and Morbius, Sony has been developing movies for&nbsp;Silver Sable and Black Cat (that project may now be shelved), Silk, and of course, the animated sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (10/7/2022). Many of the remaining characters are currently fairly obscure to mainstream audiences, but Sony appears to be betting that the movies are what will make them famous, not the other way around. One has to figure that is why they’re confident with their plans for movies about Jackpot and Madame Web. The first story this week involved TV director S.J. Clarkson (Bates Motel, Jessica Jones), who has been hired by Sony to develop a “mystery” SPUMC project that&nbsp;most sources are saying (without confirmation) is probably Madame Web. In the comics, Madame Web has been the codename of two different Marvel characters, including a former Spider-Woman, but most people seem to&nbsp;think it’s the original Madame Web, who was an elderly blind woman gifted with clairvoyance and other psychic abilities. Sony is reportedly eyeing either Charlize Theron or Amy Adams for the role, which either suggests it’s the second Madame Web, or perhaps the movie is just de-aging the original Madame Web. The second story this week concerned Jackpot, an even more obscure Marvel superhero. Sony has hired TV showrunner Marc Guggenheim, the man behind most of the CW’s “Arrowverse” shows, to start work on a Jackpot screenplay. The character in the comics has a rather convoluted story (including there being two different Jackpots), so there are many different ways the film could go, whatever Guggenheim wants to do with it/her/them.2. NICHOLAS HOULT REPLACED BY ESAI MORALES AS MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 7 VILLAIN(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Especially for big action movie franchises like Mission: Impossible, which take several months to film at locations all around the world, schedules matter, as studios need to know that any given actor will actually be available to show up on set. So as COVID-19 has delayed filming, we’re going to see a few actors dropping out of roles. Case in point: Nicholas Hoult (Mad Max: Fury Road) had been cast as the villain in Mission: Impossible 7, but he has left the project due to scheduling concerns, and he’s been replaced by Esai Morales of Netflix’s Ozark. At 57, Morales is 27 years older&nbsp; than Hoult, which also begs the question whether the character is staying the same or if it’s being rewritten during the hiatus. Mission: Impossible 7 was originally scheduled for July of next year, but the production delays have led to the film being rescheduled for November 19, 2021 (the week after Fantastic Beasts 3).3. RYAN GOSLING RETURNING TO OUTER SPACE(Photo by Daniel McFadden/©Universal Pictures)Ryan Gosling’s most recent studio movie was 2018’s First Man (Certified Fresh at 89%) ( https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_man ), in which he portrayed astronaut Neil Armstrong during the first manned moon landing in 1969. Possibly coincidentally, Gosling is now attached to star in an adaptation of an upcoming (not yet titled) novel by Andy Weir, who also wrote the eponymous astronaut-in-peril novel upon which the 2015 Matt Damon movie&nbsp;The Martian&nbsp;( Certified Fresh at 91%) was based. This new film will be produced and directed by the team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who have previously teamed up on movies like 21 Jump Street (Certified Fresh at 84%) and The LEGO Movie (Certified Fresh at 96%). The novel reportedly has the code name “Project Hail Mary” and tells the story of a lone astronaut in space who is trying to save the planet.4. STEVEN SODERBERGH SPENT QUARANTINE WRITING A SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE SEQUEL(Photo by Claudette Barius/Fingerprint Releasing/©Amazon)Back in March when most people started their “stay-at-home” time, a popular meme that went around claimed that William Shakespeare used his own quarantine time during the Black Plague&nbsp;to write King Lear. Although most of us probably just used the extra free time to play video games or binge TV shows, surely some people were actually productive, right? Prolific director, producer, and screenwriter Steven Soderbergh&nbsp;(Ocean’s 11, Magic Mike, Logan Lucky) apparently was. In an interview this week, Soderbergh revealed that “the first 6 or 7 weeks of the lockdown, I finished 3 screenplays,” with one of those three projects being “a sequel to sex, lies, and videotape&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 96%). It was an idea that had been circling for awhile, and I felt like I came up with the way to get back in, and so I wrote it, and I wanna make it.” Sex, lies, and videotape&nbsp;was, of course, Soderbergh’s feature film debut back in 1989, which was also one of the Sundance Film Festival’s earliest crossover hits. It’s not yet known if the sequel&nbsp;centers on the same characters originally played by James Spader, Andie MacDowell, and Peter Gallagher, or whether any of those actors will return. (Given how recently Soderbergh apparently came up with the concept and wrote it, it’s possible he hasn’t even talked to them yet.)5. DAVID ARQUETTE ALSO RETURNING IN SCREAM 5&nbsp;AS DEPUTY DEWEY(Photo by ©Dimension Films courtesy Everett Collection)Just two weeks ago, we received our most recent and firmest confirmation that a Scream 5 is actually going to happen soon because Neve Campbell confirmed that she’s been approached about returning as Sidney Prescott. Campbell is one third of a core trio of Scream franchise regulars&nbsp;along with David Arquette and Courtney Cox, and this week,&nbsp;Arquette also signed on to reprise his role as Sheriff Dewey Riley in the new movie. The fifth Scream movie will be directed by the team called Radio Silence, which most recently gave us last summer’s Ready or Not (Certified Fresh at 88%). Unfortunately, Wes Craven is no longer around to be involved with the project, but original Scream screenwriter Kevin Williamson is now on board as executive producer. You can read more on Everything We Know about Scream 5 right here.6. MINDY KALING TO CO-WRITE REESE WITHERSPOON’S LEGALLY BLONDE 3It feels like a third Legally Blonde has been in development for nearly all of the seventeen years since 2003’s Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde (Rotten at 37%). This week’s news suggests that we’re going to have to wait a bit longer yet, but it’s also positive news for fans in general. Mindy Kaling and TV screenwriter Dan Goor (Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Parks &amp; Recreation) have been hired by MGM to write Legally Blonde 3, possibly starting from scratch. Reese Witherspoon will indeed return as lawyer Elle Woods, but no other details are known about the premise (such as, for example, whether Kaling might also co-star). In somewhat related news, original Legally Blonde screenwriters Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith have been hired by Warner Bros. to start work on a remake of their 1979 comedy hit 10&nbsp;(Fresh at 68%), starring Dudley Moore and Bo Derek.7. NICK JONAS TO STAR IN COMIC BOOK MOVIE THE BLACKSMITH(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)To his credit, pop star-turned-actor Nick Jonas has arguably been one of the highlights of the two most recent Jumanji movies, and soon he’s going to get the opportunity to see if his charisma can carry an entire action movie. Jonas and Laurence Fishburne have both signed on to star in the comic book adaptation The Blacksmith for action director Pierre Morel&nbsp;(Taken, Peppermint, From Paris with Love). Jonas will star in the thriller as a weapons expert for the intelligence community (sort of like Q from the James Bond movies) who has to go on the run when his lab is destroyed and his secret agent coworkers are murdered. Fishburne will play the weapons expert who formerly had the Blacksmith’s job, and Jonas will also be joined by a female lead, but that role hasn’t yet been cast yet.8. HALLE BERRY JOINING JOSH GAD IN DISASTER MOVIE&nbsp;MOONFALL(Photo by RCF/Everett Collection)With his World War II movie Midway in theaters last November, action and disaster movie director Roland Emmerich has turned his&nbsp;attention towards the disaster movie Moonfall, which is exactly what it sounds like (basically, Armageddon but with the Moon). Last week, Josh Gad became the first cast member to join what will end up being a large ensemble cast, and this week, he was joined by one of the original X-Men, Halle Berry. Berry will reportedly play a former astronaut who is now a NASA administrator, no doubt pacing about in a busy control room as reports of hazard and imminent destruction come down from the crew attempting to put the Moon back in orbit. Lionsgate reportedly hopes to release&nbsp;Moonfall in 2021 following a production start in Montreal in the fall (depending upon COVID-19 delays). For the trivia buffs out there, this year marks the 20th anniversary since the last time a film directed by Roland Emmerich scored a Fresh Tomatometer score, with The Patriot (Fresh at 61%) in 2000.9. DON’T TELL MOM THE BABYSITTER’S DEAD (OR THAT THIS MOVIE IS GETTING REMADE)There is a longstanding argument to be made that the best candidates for movies to be remade are films that were “bad” the first time around. On the other hand, there is often a reason why a movie receives bad reviews, and sometimes, that reason has to do with the premise itself. In the case of the 1991 family comedy Don’t Tell Mom the Babysitter’s Dead ( Rotten at 36% ), the title may have also been a big part of the negative reaction, but it was at least&nbsp;memorable. With that in mind, a remake of Don’t Tell Mom the Babysitter’s Dead is indeed now in development with the twist this time around being that it will feature an African American family (Christina Applegate starred in the original). The remake will be directed by Bille Woodruff, whose filmography includes Honey (Rotten at 21%), Honey 2 (Rotten at 10%), and the Queen Latifah comedy Beauty Shop (Rotten at 38%).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Quiz, E!, Countdown, TV, Cartoon, streaming, Ice, Film, The, popular","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/22161615/Dinklage_Momoa_Vampire_Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"gots-peter-dinklage-and-jason-momoa-team-up-for-vampire-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509173431523","title":"Dwayne Johnson Confirms Hobbs &amp; Shaw Sequel, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Dwayne Johnson Confirms Hobbs &amp; Shaw Sequel, and More Movie NewsA bunch of Marvel movies get delayed, Michael Bay signs with Sony, Don Cheadle breaks bad for Space Jam and new projects for Anne Hathaway and Edgar Wright.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 3, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you&nbsp;seven headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as&nbsp;Black Widow, Space Jam 2, and the sequel to Hobbs &amp; Shaw.This WEEK’S TOP STORYDWAYNE JOHNSON CONFIRMS PLANS FOR HOBBS &amp; SHAW SEQUEL(Photo by Frank Masi/©Universal)Universal Pictures recently pushed the Fast &amp; Furious sequel F9 back a full year to April 2, 2021 (the date when FF10 previously would have been released). Despite&nbsp;that delay, Dwayne Johnson took to his Instagram feed in a Live Q&amp;A this week to confirm that Universal is indeed developing a sequel to last year’s spinoff Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; SHaw&nbsp;(Fresh at 67%). Johnson said of the sequel (we like to think of it as&nbsp;2 Hobbs 2 Shaw), “Just gotta figure out the creative right now, and the direction we’re going to go.” Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw earned over $759 million worldwide,&nbsp;which suggests there was an audience not only for the action movie chemistry between Johnson and co-star Jason Statham, but also for the “superhero movie” direction the&nbsp;film took. Having said that, Universal could easily switch things up with each new film, possibly taking on other action movie genres.&nbsp;The studio has not yet scheduled the second Hobbs &amp; Shaw movie for release yet, but with all of the other delays going on these days, it likely won’t be before 2022.`Other Top Headlines1. BLACK WIDOW, ETERNALS, AND OTHER MARVEL MOVIES PUSHED BACK SEVERAL MONTHS EACH(Photo by Marvel Studios)As it appears more and more likely that most movie theaters will remain closed until probably May or June (or later), studios have been pushing back their films repeatedly over the last couple of weeks. Disney, which&nbsp;has some of the biggest upcoming titles, has been slower to act, but late this afternoon, the studio did finally make some big announcements. Let’s start with Marvel Studios, which always would have been the most impacted because of the way the Marvel Cinematic Universe works. A delay to one or two films basically could mean a delay for the whole slate, or else the narrative could end up a jumbled mess. Black Widow has been pushed back six months from 5/1/2020 to 11/6/2020 (and is also getting a new composer), which was the former home to Eternals, which now takes 2/12/2021, the former date for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Rings. This continues right down the line to include Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Thor: Love and Thunder, and Captain Marvel 2 (7/8/2022). (Black Panther II, meanwhile, did not get moved from its 5/6/2022 release date.) Other movies that Disney has bumped back&nbsp;include Mulan (7/24/2020), Jungle Cruise (7/20/2021, which is a push of a whole year), and Indiana Jones 5 (7/29/2022) (likewise). Finally, the movie that is arguably experiencing the biggest change is the long-in-development Artemis Fowl (formerly scheduled for 5/29/2020), which will now skip theaters entirely to debut on the Disney+ app instead.2. EDGAR WRIGHT TO DIRECT AMBITIOUS ANDROID EPIC, SET MY HEART TO FIVE(Photo by Wilson Webb/©TriStar)As with Disney’s treatment of its Marvel slate, we can fully expect that release date shifts will have a wave-like effect for the rest of 2020 and 2021. We mention this because director Edgar Wright’s next film, Last Night in Soho, had been scheduled for release on September 25, 2020, but it’s now very possible that the film might be shifted to late 2020 or sometime in 2021. Wright himself, however, appears to be getting ready for his next film, as he&nbsp;is now attached to direct&nbsp;an adaptation of an upcoming novel called Set My Heart to Five about an android “learning to love” in an “all-too-human” future of 2054 when the lead android “works as a dentist, as he undergoes an emotional awakening that is sparked by an introduction to ’80s and ’90s movies.” That logline brings to mind two films that were both directed by Steven Spielberg: A.I. Artificial Intelligence (Certified Fresh at 74%) and Ready Player One (Certified Fresh at 72%). Edgar Wright is also still developing&nbsp;his Baby Driver sequel and an adaptation of the YA novel Grasshopper Jungle.3. SPIKE LEE REVEALS WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOR HIS ABANDONED JACKIE ROBINSON BIOPIC(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)It was only seven years ago that future Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman starred in 42, the long-in-development Jackie Robinson biopic (Certified Fresh at 80%). If we go back twice as far to 2013, that lands us in the decade of the 1990s, when Spike Lee had once hoped to give the world his own Jackie Robinson project. In the spirit of giving people something to read while they’re holed up during the current COVID-19 crisis, Lee has&nbsp;revealed a “Dropbox” containing his 1996 screenplay for his adaptation of Jackie Robinson’s autobiography, I Never Had it Made. Spike Lee seems to be putting this out there in the spirit of “what-might-have-been,” but it certainly begs the question, “could it still be made?” Might&nbsp;he still be able to make his Jackie Robinson?4. WATCHMEN DIRECTOR TAKES ON UNIVERSAL MONSTER MOVIE DON’T GO IN THE WATERUniversal Pictures scrapped their plans for their Dark Universe after the disappointment of The Mummy in 2017, but the studio has hopes of reviving those various franchises. That quick turnaround started just over a month ago&nbsp;with The Invisible Man. With that in mind, let’s look at this week’s news that Universal Pictures has hired TV director Stephen Williams (LOST, Watchmen) to helm a “suspenseful monster movie” called Don’t Go in the Water. That title could refer to any number of underwater threats, but writers online are already speculating&nbsp;that this could be a “back door” remake of Creature from the Black Lagoon. Having said that, Don’t Go in the Water could be a warning about something else, like piranha, barracuda, crocodiles, etc. Heck, this could as easily be a secret Sea Monkeys monster movie.5. ANNE HATHAWAY WILL DISCOVER WHY&nbsp;FRENCH CHILDREN DON’T THROW FOOD(Photo by Giles Keyte/Focus Features)The COVID-19 crisis is not progressing at the same pace in different nations, so some international film productions will be able to proceed sooner than here in the United States. That potentially sets up scenarios where Hollywood movie stars may pick up work in those countries while they wait for other work to resume or start here. We don’t know if that’s the case in this story, but Anne Hathaway has signed on to star in the StudioCanal production French Children Don’t Throw Food. The film will be an adaptation of the autobiography of the same title&nbsp;by Pamela Druckerman. Hathaway will star as “an American journalist who moves to Paris for her husband’s job [who] observes her French neighbors and friends to uncover the secrets behind parenting astonishingly well-behaved French children.”6. DON CHEADLE WILL BE THE VILLAIN IN SPACE JAM 2(Photo by DreamWorks courtesy Everett Collection)Amidst all of the big delays, it can seem almost jarring when one hears about something that’s proceeding unabated. For example, the animation process for Space Jam 2 is still moving forward as scheduled, according to the sequel’s star and producer, LeBron James. “Just like everything&nbsp; in the world, everything is slowed down a little bit, but we’re still on target,” James said of the film’s release date on July 16th, 2021. In related news, comedian-actor Paul Scheer also confirmed this week&nbsp;that Don Cheadle (whose casting in Space Jam 2 was actually announced last July)&nbsp;is playing the film’s villain. Live-action filming of Space Jam 2 wrapped in September of 2019.7. SCREENWRITER CONFIRMS NO SEQUEL FOR SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Until just two years ago, Disney and Lucasfilm were still committed to the Star Wars Story movies being an ongoing franchise to support the “main” franchise of films (The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker). In addition to planned projects for Boba Fett and Obi-Wan (which will instead be a Disney+ series), the ending of Solo: A Star Wars Story (Fresh at 70%)&nbsp;also seemed to suggest there was narrative room for sequels (unlike, say, Rogue One, which ended exactly where&nbsp;Star Wars: A New Hope starts). The huge wrench in all of those plans, however, was that Solo&nbsp;only earned $392 million worldwide. We’ve known for a while that the Star Wars Story movies were done, but there had been some speculation online that perhaps Alden Ehrenreich’s version of young Han Solo could continue his adventures on something for Disney+. Well, screenwriter Jon Kasdan answered that question directly this week, and he pretty much shot down such talk, specifically saying, “the D+ Star Wars slate is really… pretty packed.” Alden Ehrenreich has no feature films in the works, but he did land the lead role in the Brave New World series&nbsp;that will premiere on NBC’s Peacock app.8. ZACK SNYDER’S NEW BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE REVELATIONS(Photo by Warner Bros.)Like many filmmakers during the ongoing health crisis, Zack Snyder staged an online event recently for fans as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Rotten at 28%)&nbsp;celebrated its fourth anniversary. Especially of note were Snyder’s comments about longtime Justice League member J’onn J’onnz, the Martian Manhunter (played by Harry Lennix) and Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman. Talking about the image of Gal Gadot (teasing her debut in Batman v Superman), Snyder said that the exact setting of Wonder Woman during World War I wasn’t known while they were filming, with other possibilities (at the time) being either the Crimean War (1853 to 1856) or the American Civil War (1861 to 1865).9. MICHAEL BAY SIGNS NEW SONY DEAL STARTING WITH BLACK FIVE(Photo by Michael Germana/Everett Collection)This year marks 24 years now since Michael Bay’s&nbsp;first and only Fresh film as director, which was also his second film, The Rock (Fresh at 66%). After directing his last Transformers film (The Last Knight, Rotten at 15%), Michael Bay moved over to Netflix with last year’s 6 Underground (Rotten at 36%), starring Ryan Reynolds. Netflix has obviously been very much in the business of establishing new relationships and deals across the board, but Bay has chosen to go another direction, as he has signed a new deal that brings him back to Sony Pictures, the studio behind his very first ever film as director, Bad Boys. Bay’s first new project under this new deal at Sony will be&nbsp;an “ensemble drama” called Black Five. Sony is reportedly still hoping for an early 2020 production start date with a “big male lead.” The premise is being kept secret, but it’s reportedly got a “gritty sci-fi element to it” that’s “that’s very much in the vein other Bay films.”","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"name, APB, Animation, talk, archives, TV, thriller","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/03163620/Hobbs_Shaw_Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"dwayne-johnson-confirms-hobbs-shaw-sequel-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509171761376","title":"Sony Delays Spider-Man and Venom Sequels, and More Movies News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sony Delays Spider-Man and Venom Sequels, and More Movies NewsUncharted moves up; The Hunger Games get a prequel; One-Punch Man gets a live-action adaptation; Whitney Houston gets a biopic; and Olivia Wilde's next film has a great cast.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 24, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you&nbsp;seven headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as One-Punch Man, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark 2, and Venom: Let There Be Carnage.This WEEK’S TOP STORYSONY DELAYS SPIDER-MAN AND VENOM SEQUELS, MOVES UP&nbsp;UNCHARTED(Photo by ©Marvel/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)This week saw a number of release date changes for some of Sony’s biggest titles, beginning with the&nbsp;Venom&nbsp;sequel, starring Tom Hardy as the titular anti-hero and Woody Harrelson as (presumably) the crimson red serial killer Carnage. That movie had been scheduled for October 2, 2020, but&nbsp;Venom 2&nbsp;became&nbsp;Venom: Let There Be Carnage&nbsp;as it got bumped back&nbsp;eight months to next summer on June 25, 2021 (taking the spot where&nbsp;The Batman&nbsp;previously was to have been released). Sony Pictures also quickly took advantage of the announcement to Tweet out&nbsp;a brief teaser of the new title. Then, late on Friday, Sony further announced that its third&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;film featuring the MCU’s Tom Holland, which was set to open on July 16, 2021, will be pushed back four months to November 5, the release date of Marvel’s&nbsp;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which was itself then also pushed back to March 5, 2022. Remember that domino effect we were talking about? Holland’s other big film, the video game adaptation&nbsp;Uncharted, was then moved&nbsp;forward&nbsp;from October 8, 2021 to replace the untitled&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;sequel in the now-vacant July 16 slot. To top it all off, the sequel to the Oscar-winning animated film&nbsp;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which had been planned for April 8, 2022, was also pushed back six months to October 7 of the same year. Whew!Other Top Headlines1. WARNER BROS. DELAYS THE RELEASES OF THE BATMAN AND SHAZAM 2(Photo by Matt Reeves)Some&nbsp;of the movies originally scheduled for the summer of 2020 have been pushed back because of COVID-19,&nbsp;which has resulted in a domino effect, with their delays leading to delays in other films.&nbsp;In some cases, the movies scheduled for next year that were supposed to be filming right now need that much more extra time to get filmed, get through post-production, and get released. Few movies need quite as much time as supehero movies do, so it was probably always inevitable that Warner Bros. would have to push some of their 2021 and 2022 DC Comics movies back a bit. The biggest film being delayed is The Batman, from 6/25/2021 to October 1, 2021. Shazam! 2 was to have been released on April 1, 2022, but is now scheduled for November 4, 2022. Another studio that delayed two of their big franchise movies is Paramount Pictures, which has delayed Mission: Impossible 7 from 7/23/2021 to 11/19/2021 and Mission: Impossible 8 from 8/5/2022 to 11/4/2022, which is a curious move because it means they just put their big Tom Cruise action movie right up against… the Shazam! sequel that also just moved.2. ARE YOU READY FOR (MORE) SCARY STORIES TO TELL IN THE DARK?(Photo by CBS Films)Lionsgate probably did not have as big of box office success with last year’s Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (Certified Fresh at 78%) ($105 million worldwide) as they might have hoped, but the PG-13 horror film was also produced relatively cheaply ($25 million), and it’s also one that should have a good shelf life, since it can be revived every Halloween for a new generation of kids. That is presumably part of why Paramount Pictures (taking over from CBS Films) felt confident enough with the possible new franchise as they have pulled the trigger on a sequel by hiring the same director and writers. Director André Øvredal (Trollhunter, The Autopsy of Jane Doe) and writers Dan and Kevin Hageman can now spend their COVID-19 stay-at-home time working on a new set of stories from Alvin Schwartz’s original anthology books for the next movie. Which stories from the&nbsp;Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark books do you think should be adapted for the second movie?3.&nbsp;A&nbsp;HUNGER GAMES&nbsp;PREQUEL IS&nbsp;IN THE WORKS(Photo by Murray Close/Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)Before&nbsp;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&nbsp;came out over 20 years ago, there was a time when people were perhaps more optimistic about a popular franchise going back a generation to tell a prequel story about the franchise’s big bad villain. Now, people look back at the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;prequels and many think three movies about the young Darth Vader were maybe not a great deal, but hey, another popular franchise would never make the same mistake, right? Tell that to the people who mad&nbsp;The Hunger Games, because author Suzanne Collins has written an upcoming novel called&nbsp;The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&nbsp;(5/19/2020) about the future villain Coriolanus Snow when he was a young 18-year-old man. Lionsgate has quickly&nbsp;picked up the rights&nbsp;to&nbsp;The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which will again be directed by Francis Lawrence, who directed all of the&nbsp;Hunger Games&nbsp;movies except the first one.&nbsp;The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&nbsp;tells the story of young Coriolanus Snow, who is frustrated when he discovers he has been “assigned to mentor the girl tribute from impoverished District 12” (the same district that Jennifer Lawrence’s Katniss Everdeen will also eventually come from).4.&nbsp;POPULAR ANIME FRANCHISE&nbsp;ONE-PUNCH MAN&nbsp;GETS LIVE-ACTION ADAPTATION(Photo by Viz Media)Although last year’s&nbsp;Pokemon: Detective Pikachu&nbsp;was usually credited as being a success for “video game movies,” the argumennt could also be made that it was just as much an adaptation of anime and manga, which is another type of live-action adaptation that has mostly struggled in Hollywood to date. As with most of these situations, it’s inevitably just a matter of time before someone in the industry figures out the right project, which then becomes a big enough success that it opens the gates for others. Sony Pictures is gambling that perhaps the popular anime series&nbsp;One-Punch Man&nbsp;could be exactly that, as they are now developing a live-action&nbsp;One-Punch Man&nbsp;movie, which will be adapted for the big screen by Venom&nbsp;screenwriters Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner.&nbsp;One-Punch Man&nbsp;tells the continuing adventures of a superhero called Saitama who has perfected his fighting abilities to the point where he can literally defeat any opponent with just one punch, but that overwhelming power has also left him bored with his life.5.&nbsp;I WANNA DANCE WITH SOMEBODY&nbsp;WILL BE WHITNEY HOUSTON’S BIOPIC(Photo by Suzie Gibbons/Getty Images)The critical and box office successes in 2018 and 2019 of both&nbsp;Bohemian Rhapsody&nbsp;($903 million worldwide) and&nbsp;Rocketman&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 89%)&nbsp;have already led to the rapid development of other musical biopics. Two that will be released in 2020 or 2021 are&nbsp;Respect&nbsp;(Aretha Franklin as played by Jennifer Hudson) and Baz Luhrmann’s&nbsp;Elvis&nbsp;(Elvis Presley as played by Austin Butler, or “Tex” from&nbsp;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). After some rumors last years, this week it was confirmed that Whitney Houston will also be getting a biopic, and it will be&nbsp;called&nbsp;I Wanna Dance With Somebody, named after Houston’s Grammy-winning 1987 hit. The project is being produced by Clive Davis, the A&amp;R executive who helped shepherd Houston’s early career, and who will almost certainly also be a major character in the film.&nbsp;I Wanna Dance With Somebody&nbsp;will be directed by Stella Meghie, who recently directed&nbsp;The Photograph&nbsp;(Fresh at 73%), starring Issa Rae and Lakeith Stanfield. The next question the producers will have to figure out&nbsp;is, “Who can play Whitney?”6.&nbsp;FLORENCE PUGH JOINS OLIVIA WILDE’S NEXT AS DIRECTOR AFTER&nbsp;BOOKSMART(Photo by A24)The best-reviewed comedy&nbsp;of 2019 was&nbsp;Booksmart&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 97%), the directorial debut of actress Olivia Wilde,which made her a hot commodity among various studios and producers hoping to snatch up her next film. That project will be Don’t Worry, Darling, a 1950s-set psychological thriller for New Line Cinema that Wilde will star in as well as direct and produce.&nbsp;Don’t Worry, Darling&nbsp;will have an ensemble cast and a secret premise (though it sounds a bit like&nbsp;The Stepford Wives), set at “an isolated, utopian community in the 1950s California desert and centers on a housewife who uncovers a disturbing truth about her seemingly perfect life.” Florence Pugh (Midsommar,&nbsp;Little Women) will play the housewife, and Shia LaBeouf and Chris Pine are also in talks for other roles.7. CHRIS PINE’S POST-STAR TREK TRAJECTORY INCLUDES REBOOTING THE SAINT(Photo by Warner Bros.)Speaking of Chris Pine, Paramount Pictures will definitely make more Star Trek movies someday, but it’s unclear if those films will continue the “Kelvin” setting from the 2009 Star Trek reboot (Certified Fresh at 94%). (That version’s Scotty, Simon Pegg, recently spoke up about the difficulties of the Star Trek franchise at this point.) As such, the various stars of the current iteration of the USS Enterprise crew&nbsp;are free to&nbsp;continue their careers post-Star-Trek, and that includes Pine, the current Captain Kirk. Paramount seems eager to keep Pine around, though because the two parties are currently in talks&nbsp;for the former to star in a new reboot&nbsp;of the classic 1920s “gentleman thief” franchise, The Saint, taking over the role previously played by Val Kilmer on the big screen&nbsp;and by Roger Moore in the original British TV series. Chris Pine’s The Saint will be directed by Dexter Fletcher, who is coming off both the Elton John musical Rocketman and some directing work on Bohemian Rhapsody. Fletcher is also attached to Sherlock Holmes 3 and the Dracula spinoff project Renfield for Universal Pictures, but it seems possible that The Saint will be his next film before Sherlock Holmes 3.8.&nbsp;AVENGERS: ENDGAME DIRECTOR REMINDS US BATTLE OF THE PLANETS IS STILL IN THE WORKS(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Marvel/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Presuming Hollywood’s decades-old tradition of “one for them, one for me,” directors Joe and Anthony Russo&nbsp;can basically pursue whatever passion projects they may have, thanks to delivering blockbuster hits like Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame. Both brothers (born 1970 and 1971) are solidly members of Generation X, so it is perhaps of little surprise that one of their dream projects is an adaptation of the 1970s anime TV series Battle of the Planets. With their Chris Hemsworth movie Extraction debuting today on Netflix, Joe Russo is doing lots of publicity talks, and that included updating everyone about Battle of the Planets (and the Community movie). Russo said, “It’s not going to be a direct adaptation of the series. It’s going to be our own story that we tell surrounding a group of genetically altered kids who are involved in a space war… That could take months of gestating, and trying to figure out what the new mythology is. And then we commit that to a bible, and then from that bible we do some artwork as exploration, and once we have artwork that we’re inspired by, we then commit that to a script. So we’re in the bible phase for Battle of the Planets at the moment.” Distilling that down, it sounds like we’re at least two years before Battle of the Planets is likely to start filming, but it seems like it’s definitely happening.9. RYAN REYNOLDS AND FREE GUY DIRECTOR ALREADY REUNITING(Photo by 20th Century Studios)With COVID-19 essentially pushing most release dates back three to six months, the Ryan Reynolds action comedy Free Guy is now about eight months away from release, on December 11, 2020 (pushed back five months fom 7/3/2020). The movie was presumably pretty much done (except for maybe some post-production), so its star Ryan Reynolds and its director Shawn Levy&nbsp;are already talking about doing another movie. The film doesn’t appear to have a title yet, but it’s being described as a time travel drama about a man (Reynolds) who travels back in time to get help from his 13-year-old self, which leads to an encounter with his now-dead father, who back then was the age Reynolds is now.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Cinematographers, Rom-Com, LGBT","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/27094227/Spider-Man_Delayed-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"sony-delays-spider-man-and-venom-sequels-and-more-movies-news"},{"id":"47509173447916","title":"The Thing Is Getting Another Remake, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Thing Is Getting Another Remake, and More Movie NewsDisney plans \"photo-realistic\" Bambi, Paramount plans two new Transformers movies, Lethal Weapon 5 may happen, Anaconda gets a remake, and Adam Sandler re-ups with Netflix.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 31, 2020 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news (the stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering stories for titles like Bambi, Lethal Weapon 5, The Matrix 4, and more Transformers.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHE THING TO&nbsp;BE REMADE AGAIN(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)John Carpenter’s science fiction horror movie The Thing remains one of the most beloved and critically acclaimed (Certified Fresh at 84%, Audience Score 92%), but explaining its cinematic genealogy gets tricky. The&nbsp;1982 film was actually a remake of 1951’s The Thing from Another World (Fresh at 89%), which was itself adapted from the 1938 novella “Who Goes There?” We also have to fit in the 2011 movie also called The Thing (Rotten at 35%), which was actually a prequel to the 1982 film. And then, last year, a new book called Frozen Hell: The Book That Inspired The Thing was published,&nbsp;adding another 45 pages to the original novella to make it a proper novel-length story. So, now that we have a longer version of the story behind The Thing, Universal Pictures and Blumhouse are teaming up to fast track a new adaptation. This new movie promises to be a direct adaptation of author John W. Campbell, Jr.’s original story, but it’s also going to be remaking the story of at least two of these previous movies. It’s also worth noting that this whole thing originally started with a Kickstarter campaign, which you can read about right here.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;DISNEY TO GIVE&nbsp;BAMBI&nbsp;THE&nbsp;LION KING TREATMENT(Photo by ©Walt Disney courtesy Everett Collection)The world has gotten very used to seeing new remakes of classic Walt Disney animated films a couple times a year (Dumbo,&nbsp;Aladdin, and The Lion King last year, and the upcoming Mulan on 3/27/2020), but it’s far from a very recent phenomenon. Back in 2016, there were already enough such movies that Saturday Night Live was able to make a spoof trailer&nbsp;starring Dwayne Johnson as a gun-toting, cigar-chomping, live-action Bambi. We’ve now gotten far enough from that parody that we can report, without irony, that Walt Disney Pictures is indeed developing a remake&nbsp;of the 1942 baby deer drama Bambi (Certified Fresh at 90%). The way these remakes are announced is changing, as the language “live action” is now dropped&nbsp;in favor of “photo-realistic CGI,” which acknowledges what most people realized, namely that a movie like last year’s The Lion King was not live action. Screenwriters Geneva Robertson-Dworet (co-writer of Captain Marvel and Tomb Raider) and Lindsey Beer (co-writer of the upcoming Chaos Walking) are now working on a screenplay that will update the dialogue and narrative of the original 1942 classic.2.&nbsp;TWO NEW TRANSFORMERS REBOOTS IN DEVELOPMENT (AND ONE MIGHT BE BEAST WARS)The 2018 Transformers prequel Bumblebee (Certified Fresh at 92%)&nbsp;earned over $468 million worldwide, which is a lot of money, but it was perceived as a disappointment, because it was part of a franchise that has had two movies that earned over $1.1 billion (movies #3 and #4). Probably inspired by those prior successes, Paramount Pictures has announced that it&nbsp;is developing two separate projects&nbsp;to “revamp” the Transformers franchise. The screenwriters working on these new projects are James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, Murder Mystery) and Joby Harold (co-writer of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword). Officially, Paramount hasn’t said what either of these two movies is about, but rumors quickly spread online this week&nbsp;that one of them might be Beast Wars, which is basically about Transformers that turn into animals&nbsp;instead of cars and planes. You can read about other directions Transformers might go next in this piece over at Collider.3. PRIYANKA CHOPRA JONAS TO JOIN THE MATRIX 4(Photo by Ganesh Patil/©Aanna Films)Ever since Warner Bros. and the Wachowskis confirmed last summer that The Matrix 4&nbsp;is officially “a go,” we’ve received a steady drip of casting news, both old (Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss) and new (Neil Patrick Harris, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). The latest addition to the cyberpunk saga to be announced is Priyanka Chopra Jonas, the now more available star of ABC’s Quantico, which ended its three-season run in 2018. Priyanka Chopra Jonas is also both a singer and a “Bollywood” star with over 60 films to her credit. Warner Bros. is currently remaining quiet on the nature of Chopra Jonas’ character (as they have been for all of the new cast members). The Matrix 4 is currently scheduled for release on May 21, 2021, up against John Wick Chapter 4, which is obviously another&nbsp;fourth franchise installment starring Keanu Reeves.4. PEE-WEE HERMAN’S NEXT ADVENTURE MIGHT BE WITH THE SAFDIE BROTHERSThe way that Hollywood works leaves some projects waiting for years and years (or decades) to get produced, and many movie concepts just never happen at all. Comedian Paul Reubens’ most well-known character, Pee-Wee Herman, lay dormant for a long&nbsp;time, but starting in the 1990s, Reubens had a screenplay treatment in which Pee-Wee would emerge from a dark period in his life as a celebrity, mirroring what he himself went through. Hollywood, however, never bit on that premise, so instead his comeback came in 2016 with the Netflix movie, Pee-Wee’s Big Holiday (Certified Fresh at 80%). Paul Reubens now hopes to finally get that “dark” Pee-Wee Herman movie produced, having recently talked to the Safdie Brothers&nbsp;(Uncut Gems, Good Time) about getting it made. (Stay tuned for any news about them actually signing on.)5. ANDY SAMBERG’S PALM SPRINGS SETS SUNDANCE RECORD BY 69 CENTS (SORT OF)(Photo by ©Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)Every January, distributors both big and small head to the Sundance Film Festival in the hopes of snapping up one of the festival’s most talked-about movies for amounts both frugal and ambitious. It is, however, those larger amounts that generally make the most news (especially since so many of those projects end up having disappointing box office results upon release). Until this week, the record was held by 2016’s The Birth of a Nation (Certified Fresh at 73%), which was acquired by Fox Searchlight for $17.5 million. With that amount very much in mind, Neon and Hulu broke the record this year by acquiring the Andy Samberg comedy Palm Springs for a total of $17,500,00.69, which is exactly 69 cents more than the previous record. It made for a great headline, but this news comes with a big asterisk, because The Birth of a Nation was a deal for just theatrical, while this deal is for both theatrical and streaming (Hulu), so it’s not exactly apples-to-apples.6.&nbsp;ELDERLY&nbsp;CAST OF LETHAL WEAPON GETTING BACK TOGETHER(Photo by (c)Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)At 64 (Mel Gibson), 73 (Danny Glover), and 76 (Joe Pesci), the cast of the Lethal Weapon franchise truly are now very close to being&nbsp;“too old for this s–t.” On the other hand, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence just reunited earlier this month for Bad Boys for Life to pretty great box office numbers, so you can pretty much guess what the Lethal Weapon guys are doing. During a recent roundtable interview, producer Daniel Lin revealed that Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, and director Richard Donner are currently all in talks to return for a fifth film. It’s unclear if there is an actual screenplay for such a reunion, but there have been reports off and on over the 22 years since Lethal Weapon 4 (Rotten at 52%), so perhaps they’re thinking of just dusting off one of those old screenplays and adding more arthritis and Viagra jokes. Did we mention they’re old?7. KEVIN HART’S NEXT ACTION COMEDY STRAIGHT MAN TO BE JASON STATHAM(Photo by Warner Bros.)After starring in a couple of movies with Ice Cube (Ride Along, Ride Along 2) and more than a couple with Dwayne Johnson (Central Intelligence, and two Jumanji movies), Kevin Hart&nbsp;has found the next action star with whom he can&nbsp;pull off his comedy high jinx. Hart and Jason Statham will co-star in the action comedy&nbsp;The Man from Toronto, about an assassin who goes by the titular codename who is mixed up with a regular guy, leading to the obvious action movie duck-out-of-water shenanigans. The Man from Toronto will be directed by Patrick Hughes, who previously worked with Statham on The Expendables 3&nbsp;(Rotten at 32%).8.&nbsp;HOLLYWOOD’S REBOOTING OF THE 1990S CONTINUES WITH… ANACONDA(Photo by (c)Columbia courtesy Everett Collection)One of the most complained-about Hollywood trends is the perceived “new” obsession with reboots and remakes, but it’s worth remembering that this is far from a recent phenomenon, like at all. Classic Hollywood is full of remakes, such as 1931’s Frankenstein and 1939’s The Wizard of Oz, both of which were&nbsp;originally produced as&nbsp;silent movies decades earlier. Generally&nbsp;speaking, Hollywood&nbsp;tends to remake films that are anywhere from 20 to 40 years old.&nbsp;Average those numbers and you get 30 years, which means we’re primed for movies of the 1990s to be updated for contemporary audiences. The latest example this week is the 1997 giant snake movie Anaconda (Rotten at 40%), which was an early movie for Ice Cube, Owen Wilson, and Jennifer Lopez. Columbia Pictures is now working on a Anaconda reboot/remake&nbsp;which will be written by screenwriter Evan Daugherty, whose previous films include 2014’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Rotten at 22%) and Snow White and the Huntsman (Rotten at 49%).9. ADAM SANDLER SIGNS NEW NETFLIX CONTRACT(Photo by (c)Columbia courtesy Everett Collection)According to Netflix, since Adam Sandler first started&nbsp;making movies for them in 2015 with The Ridiculous 6 (Rotten at 0%), subscribers have collectively watched over two billion hours of&nbsp;his movies on the streaming service. Exactly how Netflix’s streaming numbers translate into&nbsp;their production decisions has always been somewhat nebulous, but whatever the math, Netflix agreed this week to a new contract with Sandler for another four movies. These four movies will include an animated film that Sandler will write, produce, and star in, but the title and details of that movie haven’t been revealed just yet.Like this?

Jordan.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 14, 2020 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news (the stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering stories for titles like Aladdin 2, The Batman, Hamilton, and Porgy and Bess.This WEEK’S TOP STORYDISNEY’S LIVE-ACTION&nbsp;ALADDIN GETS A SEQUEL(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Disney’s CGI remake of The Lion King was one of last year’s biggest box office hits ($1.65 billion and #2 behind Avengers: Endgame), but Disney’s Aladdin also did extremely well, topping $1 billion worldwide. We have not heard about plans for a Lion King sequel (and there certainly were sequels and prequels to the original film), but that’s exactly what happened for Aladdin this week. Despite its box office success, Aladdin has a Rotten Tomatometer score at 57%, which might help to explain why Disney has hired a new pair of screenwriters&nbsp;for the sequel, and there’s no word yet about director Guy Ritchie returning. The new writers are John Gatins (Power Rangers, Real Steel) and Andrea Berloff (World Trade Center; co-writer of Straight Outta Compton), but their credits only give us tiny hints at what their Aladdin sequel could be like (i.e. about as much as you could tell about Aladdin by looking at the credits of director Guy Ritchie). Not much has been revealed about the Aladdin sequel, except that it won’t be a Disney Plus title, and it won’t be an adaptation of any of the 1990s direct-to-video sequels.Other Top Headlines1. NEW VIDEO SHOWS OFF THE COSTUME AND MUSIC OF NEXT YEAR’S THE BATMAN(Photo by Matt Reeves)We are over 16 months away from the release in the summer of 2021 of The Batman (6/25/2021),&nbsp;the reboot of DC Comics’ most popular superhero to introduce Robert Pattinson (Twilight, The Lighthouse) as our new Bruce Wayne. Even though the movie is that far away, director Matt Reeves&nbsp;(Cloverfield, War for the Planet of the Apes) this week released a video described as “camera test footage”&nbsp;that shows off both the new Batman costume and also some of the new musical theme from composer Michael Giacchino (LOST, Star Trek, Avengers: Endgame). Curiously, Reeves chose to show us the new Batman costume bathed in a dark red lighting, which also inspired comparisons to&nbsp;the costume&nbsp;from Netflix’s Daredevil (even if it won’t actually be red). It’s very possible that the reason the costume preview came out this week is that Reeves will soon be starting the exterior filming of The Batman, at which point we probably will be getting set photos of Pattinson as The Batman anyway (in addition to Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, Paul Dano as the Riddler, and Colin Farrell as the Penguin).2.&nbsp;MARGOT ROBBIE AND MICHAEL B. JORDAN JOIN CHRISTIAN BALE IN NEW DAVID O. RUSSELL FILM(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, JA/Everett Collection)There have been so many superhero movies in recent years that we’re increasingly at a point where there are nearly more major stars who have been in them than those who haven’t. So, for example, the new movie from David O. Russell&nbsp;(American Hustle, Silver Linings Playbook) has three big stars, and they’re The Dark Knight, Killmonger from Black Panther, and Harley Quinn. Christian Bale was the first to sign on&nbsp;for Russell’s untitled new film (formerly titled Amsterdam), and this week gave us two of his co-stars, both within a few hours of each other. First up was Margot Robbie,&nbsp;the star of last week’s Birds of Prey, who landed the female lead that had formerly had been speculated as a possible role for frequent Russell collaborator Jennifer Lawrence. The Robbie announcement was quickly followed on Wednesday&nbsp;by Michael B. Jordan, who is taking a role for which Jamie Foxx had previously been rumored as a frontrunner. David O. Russell is keeping the premise secret, but it’s described as being about an unlikely partnership between a doctor and a lawyer.3. LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA SAYS DISNEY WILL PROBABLY “MUTE” HAMILTON SWEARS(Photo by Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images)It may not have been immediately obvious, but there was one awkward element in the news last week that Walt Disney Pictures would be releasing a filmed version of the Broadway hit Hamilton in theaters next year (10/15/2021). That awkward detail is the language of some of the dialogue, which includes what we will delicately call “F bombs.” The sticky issue here is that Disney has a self-described policy of PG-13-and-under ratings, which the repeated use of the “F word” would seem buck against (the MPAA does sometimes allow that word to be used once in a film and retain its PG-13 rating). So, Lin-Manuel Miranda was asked by a New York Times reporter this week about how Disney is going to reconcile the language issue, and he confirmed that, “if we have to mute a word here or there to reach the largest audience possible, I’m OK with that, because your kids already have the original language memorized.” One possibility is that perhaps Disney will use some sort of sound effect (like a drum beat or a cymbal clang) that will blur the language without specifically using a “bleep” sound or an over obvious “muting” sound effect.4. OLYMPIC TRUE STORIES FROM OLIVIA WILDE AND ZOE SALDANA IN THE WORKS(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Sometimes two completely different movie stories will come out in the same week that have remarkably similar themes. This week, it was “biopics about female Olympic athletes.”&nbsp;One of them will be called Perfect, which will be an adaptation of the book Landing on My Feet: A Diary of Dreams, co-written by 1990s Olympic gymnast Kerri Strug, about her struggle at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta&nbsp;(also the setting of last year’s Richard Jewell). The adaptation of Strug’s book will be directed by actress-turned-director Olivia Wilde, who made her debut last year with Booksmart (Certified Fresh at 97%). It’s not yet known if the Kerri Strug biopic will be Olivia Wilde’s next film as director. The other Olympic movie in the news this week is Fencer, in which Zoe Saldana will star as Olympic fencer Jasmine McGlade for producer Casey Affleck.5. AMERICAN OPERA PORGY AND BESS TO BECOME MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1959Although some stories seem to get new movie adaptations ever three or four years (Peter Pan, Dracula, Robin Hood, etc.), there are others that have either never been adapted, or haven’t been in several decades. One such example of that is George Gershwin’s opera of love in the American South, Porgy and Bess, which previously was adapted by Otto Preminger as a movie in 1959.&nbsp;Mudbound director Dee Rees is now partnering with MGM for&nbsp;a new adaptation, which Rees will both write and direct. It’s not yet known who might play either Porgy or Bess, or whether Dee Rees’ adaptation might shift the setting from 1920s Charleston to a more contemporary setting (or if the music will be updated). Mudbound received a Certified Fresh Tomatometer at 97%&nbsp;and four Academy Award nominations (Supporting Actress, Adapted Screenplay, Original Song, and Cinematography).6. HARRIET STAR CYNTHIA ERIVO TO STAR IN SCI-FI PODCAST ADAPTATION CARRIER(Photo by Eli Winston/Everett Collection)As new ways of telling stories emerge, they also eventually lead to movies being adapted from them. For example, in the last few years, we’ve had both The Emoji Movie and Slenderman, based on online phenomenons. Another new form that has its origins in the Internet is the podcast, which takes many forms, but there are some that actually tell narrative stories. Cynthia Erivo, who starred in last year’s Harriet, played one of the characters in the sci-fi podcast Carrier,&nbsp;and she is now attached to reprise her role as a truck driver in a movie adaptation. Carrier will be produced by Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners, which recently co-produced both 1917 and Dark Waters.7.&nbsp;AWKWAFINA TO DEPICT A REAL LIFE PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER IN THE BACCARAT MACHINE(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)In the United States, there are many popular casino games (blackjack, roulette, craps), but one that is less popular is baccarat, which most Americans probably know only as the game James Bond likes to play. Baccarat’s pop culture reputation may soon get a bump thanks to Awkwafina, who is now attached to star as real-life professional gambler Cheung Yin “Kelly” Sun in a biopic called The Baccarat Machine. Despite that title, one game that might actually be depicted as much (or more) is poker, because the story will reportedly depict Sun’s “unlikely partership with legendary poker player Phil Ivey.”8. RICK MORANIS TO COME OUT OF RETIREMENT FOR JOSH GAD’S SEQUEL SHRUNK(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)If you’re a fan of Ghostbusters, you might already know that Rick Moranis has famously been something of a recluse&nbsp;for many years now, and has frequently turned down opportunities to return to franchises like Ghostbusters. So, when the news broke out last year that Josh Gad was attached to star in Shrunk, a sequel and/or reboot of the popular Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise, one might have been tempted to theorize about who might be cast in the role originally played by Moranis. One need not fan-cast such a replacement, it turns out, because Disney worked their magic and got Moranis to return&nbsp;in a supporting role to Josh Gad’s character as his scientist son. There had been some online speculation that Shrunk might be a Disney Plus project, but it was also confirmed this week to be a planned theatrical release.9.&nbsp;THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE TO GET REMADE YET AGAINThere seems to be something about classic slasher franchises from the 1970s and 1980s that lends them to being rebooted or remade multiple times. For some higher profile examples, the Halloween franchise was soft-rebooted in 2018 after having already been rebooted by Rob Zombie in 2007, and a similar reboot is in the works for Friday the 13th. Another slasher franchise that already has a particular confusing filmography to decipher is The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which has what are described as both a “remake series” (2003 and 2006) and an “alternate series” (the more recent films from 2013 and 2017). Legendary Pictures, the company behind monster reboots like Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island,&nbsp;is now developing a reboot&nbsp;of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to be directed by Ryan and Andy Tohill, who made their feature film debuts in 2018 with the indie film The Dig (Fresh at 73%). This latest reboot will be produced by Fede Alvarez (the director of Don’t Breathe), who described their version as, “violent, exciting, and so depraved it will stay with you forever.” Tobe Hooper’s original 1974 film is Certified Fresh at 88%, but the other later films are all Rotten.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Schedule, Plus, service, TNT, Super","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/14165610/Aladdin_Sequel_Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"disneys-live-action-aladdin-gets-a-sequel-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509173440744","title":"Ford v Ferrari‘s James Mangold Will Direct Indiana Jones 5, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ford v Ferrari's James Mangold Will Direct Indiana Jones 5, and More Movie NewsNo Time To Die gets a runtime, Jurassic World gets a name, Chris Evans in talks for Little Shop of Horror and more.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 28, 2020 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Creed 3, Indiana Jones 5, Jurassic World: Dominion, and Little Shop of Horrors.&nbsp;This WEEK’S TOP STORYLOGAN DIRECTOR TO REPLACE SPIELBERG ON INDIANA JONES 5(Photo by Paramount/courtesy Everett Collection)When Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, the obvious focus was on the Star Wars franchise, but Indiana Jones was another long-running property that Disney acquired at the same time. By that point, Paramount had already been developing an Indiana Jones 5 for a few years (basically since the 2008 release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), which continued until the film finally received a release date of July 19, 2019. That obviously didn’t happen, with the release date now landing next summer on July 9, 2021 (four days before Harrison Ford turns 79). With Steven Spielberg still working on his West Side Story remake (12/18/2020), there had been recent speculation about Indiana Jones 5, which was answered this week as Steven Spielberg has dropped out of directing it. Instead, James Mangold&nbsp;is now in talks to direct Indiana Jones 5, with Ford still attached as the film’s star. It’s unclear when Indiana Jones 5 will start filming, or if the release date will change, but Ford did just say two weeks ago that he expected to start filming in April.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Other Top Headlines1. THE RUN TIME OF NO TIME TO DIE MAY&nbsp;REVEALED(Photo by UA/Everett Collection)For most of its first few decades, the movies in the James Bond franchise&nbsp;had a fairly consistent running time range in the range of two hours or so, but they started getting longer when Daniel Craig took on the role (all but Quantum of Solace were between 143 and 148 minutes). So, it may have come as surprising news this week when Regal Cinemas revealed that No Time to Die (4/10/2020) will have a running time of 163 minutes, or just 17 minutes shy of three hours. Put another way, that means that No Time to Die will be 15 minutes longer than Spectre, which had been the longest film at 148 minutes.&nbsp;2. CREED III&nbsp;GETS IT SCREENWRITER(Photo by MGM)The 2018 Rocky franchise sequel Creed II ended up earning over $214 million worldwide, which was an increase over the $173 million earned by the first Creed. So, it’s unsurprising that MGM is now developing a third Creed movie for their star Michael B. Jordan. MGM has hired screenwriter Zach Baylin to start work&nbsp;on a third&nbsp;Creed.&nbsp;As for what Creed III will be about, there is already speculation online&nbsp;that Sylvester Stallone’s Rocky Balboa may not be coming back. Stallone is currently staying very busy, including both his superhero movie Samaritan (12/11/2020) and the futuristic action movie Little America . &nbsp;3. CHRIS EVANS MIGHT TAKE OVER STEVE MARTIN ROLE IN LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Chris Evans is in talks to play dentist Orin Scrivello in a new Little Shop of Horrors, the role previously made legendary by&nbsp;Steve Martin in the 1986 movie version. Taron Egerton is in talks to play the film’s lead, Seymour, the sad-sack store clerk who&nbsp;tends to a man-eating monster plant called Audrey II (to be voiced by Billy Porter). Scarlett Johansson is also in talks to play Audrey I, the human lady who inspires the plant’s name. Little Shop of Horrors will be directed by Greg Berlanti, whose most recent film was last year’s Love, Simon.4. JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION REVEALED AS NEXT DINOSAUR MOVIE’S TITLE(Photo by ILM/Getty Images)The next Jurassic&nbsp;movie will be called&nbsp;Jurassic World: Dominion. This news came directly from director Colin Trevorrow, who tweeted an image of the clapper&nbsp;to announce the start of filming on Monday. Dominion will feature the return of three of Jurassic Park‘s&nbsp;original stars (Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Sam Neill) when it’s released next summer on June 11, 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. FILMING OF MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 7 DELAYED OVER CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS(Photo by Paramount/Everett Collection)The continuing spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 is having a multiple impacts on the film and TV industry (for example, CBS has stopped filming of The Amazing Race). One of the European nations which currently has the most reported cases is Italy, which had been planned as the location for three weeks of filming of Mission: Impossible 7&nbsp;in Venice, but Paramount has halted those plans for now. Paramount is expected to move its cast and crew out of Italy. It’s not yet known if the production will move back to Venice at a later point, or if perhaps a new location for those sequences will be chosen. Mission: Impossible 7 remains scheduled for release on July 23, 2021.6. A BIG WEEK FOR CANDY MEN: A POSTER &amp; TRAILER, PLUS A SAMMY DAVIS JR BIOPIC(Photo by TriStar/Everett Collection)This week, two different movies related to the words “Candy Man” both made the news. It all started on Tuesday, when the first poster for Candyman (6/12/2020) appeared, before its trailer debut. Right in-between those two Candyman stories, however, there was also the news about the biopic of&nbsp;singer-turned-actor Sammy Davis, Jr, whose signature song was “The Candy Man,” as featured in the original Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory. Paramount Pictures has hired screenwriter Charles Murray (Netflix’s Luke Cage) to work on their currently untitled&nbsp;project, which is reportedly to be based upon Davis’ 1965 memoir, Yes I Can: The Story of Sammy Davis Jr..7. KEVIN HART TEAMING UP WITH BROAD CITY WRITERS FOR NEXT ACTION COMEDY(Photo by Eli Joshua Ade. ©Universal Pictures/Everett Collection)Following a long spate of hyper-productivity over the last few years, Kevin Hart is currently in a relative slow spot, with only one movie wrapped and awaiting release (Fatherhood, scheduled for 1/15/2021). Several movies are in pre-production, however, and this week, Kevin Hart added another:&nbsp;An untitled action comedy (with an unknown premise) by two writers&nbsp;from&nbsp;Comedy Central series Broad City. The untitled comedy will be directed by Malcolm D. Lee, who most recently directed Hart in Night School.8. ELEVEN-TIME ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE DIANE WARREN TO GET HER OWN JUKEBOX MUSICAL(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Songwriter Diane Warren has been songs for both Hollywood and major recording acts for over 40 years now, which has given her 11 Academy Award nominations&nbsp;for Best Original Song and no wins. Following the successes of movies like Mamma Mia! and Rocketman, Paramount Pictures has started development&nbsp;on an untitled musical drama which will feature many of her most popular songs, and new ones as well. The screenwriter will be Tamara Chestna, who made her feature film debut last year as a co-writer of the romantic drama&nbsp;After.9. UNIVERSAL PICTURES ADAPTING THE MISTER FROM FIFTY SHADES OF GREY AUTHOR(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)Universal-owned Focus Features released their three entries&nbsp;of the Fifty Shades trilogy between 2015 and 2018. After a “heated bidding war,” Universal Pictures this week also won the rights for author E.L. James’ next book,&nbsp;The Mister.

In a surprise announcement, Marvel Studios is going with a director who wasn’t widely considered to be a frontrunner, despite&nbsp;being one of the thematically best fits imaginable. That’s because it is now Sam Raimi, the director of the first three Spider-Man movies (the ones starring Tobey Maguire), who is in talks with Marvel Studios to take over directing duties on Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (5/7/2021). So, why exactly is Raimi such a good choice? First off, we should note that Spider-Man is one of two major characters co-created in the early 1960s by the team of Steve Ditko and Stan Lee; the other one is Doctor Strange. Secondly, Sam Raimi first made his mark in the 1980s with the Evil Dead movies, which share a few supernatural themes with Doctor Strange, including evil magic books, possessed inanimate objects, time travel, and teleportation. In related news, rumors continue to abound that Marvel Studios is currently looking to cast&nbsp;the interdimensional sorcereress Clea, Doctor Strange’s long-time romantic interest.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;DISNEY TO BRING&nbsp;HAMILTON&nbsp;TO MOVIE THEATERS IN 2021(Photo by Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images)Every once in a while, there will be a big movie news story that&nbsp;is quickly misinterpreted online, partly because people tend&nbsp;run with headlines on social media&nbsp;without actually reading the full story. This week, the big story that falls in that category is “the Hamilton movie that Disney is making for release in 2021,” which is only half accurate, as the rest is a twisting of what Disney is actually doing. This week, Walt Disney Pictures did indeed announce&nbsp;a release date of October 15, 2021 for Hamilton, except that what it actually is will be a filmed presentation of the original stage musical featuring the original cast (including Lin-Manuel Miranda), filmed at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in Manhattan. The filming was actually done in 2016, before any of the original cast had departed, so that means the “movie” will come out five years after it was filmed. Disney reportedly paid $75 million for the film rights to Hamilton, but reportedly, that could also include&nbsp;a&nbsp;true big-screen version of Hamilton (i.e., something more like Les Miserables, West Side Story, and In the Heights) that could be produced at a later date.2. VIN DIESEL HINTS THAT FAST &amp; FURIOUS X MIGHT ACTUALLY BE SPLIT IN TWO(Photo by Scott Garfield/Universal Pictures)It may have happened before, but when Warner Bros decided to split Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows into two parts, they arguably established a precedent for other franchises to get an extra movie out of their profitable franchises’ final entries (like&nbsp;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay,&nbsp;The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, etc).&nbsp; This week, while talking up the big trailer debut for Fast &amp; Furious 9, Vin Diesel revealed that Universal Pictures may split Fast &amp; Furious 10 (Fast &amp; Furious X seems a more likely title since the franchise was originally almost titled Racer X back in 2001) into two parts. This is far from a confirmation at this point, but since Universal presumably wants to keep making these lucrative films for as long (and as often) as possible, Fast &amp; Furious getting an eleventh movie instead of just 10 seems pretty likely. Fast &amp; Furious 9 comes out this summer (5/22/2020), and Fast &amp; Furious 10 (or X) is scheduled for release next spring on April 2, 2021.3.&nbsp;KNIVES OUT SEQUEL IS OFFICIALLY IN THE WORKS(Photo by Claire Folger/©Lionsgate)Just a few weeks ago, writer-director Rian Johnson told the Hollywood Reporter that he was eager to get a sequel to his now Oscar-nominated (for Best Original Screenplay) whodunit&nbsp;Knives Out&nbsp;going and that he was already developing a new case for Benoit Blanc, the eccentric detective played by Daniel Craig, to crack. At the time, though, there wasn’t any official confirmation that such a project was on the books for Lionsgate, even if it was something of a foregone conclusion. That all changed this week, when the studio officially announced&nbsp;in a conference call on Thursday that it was planning to start production on a&nbsp;Knives Out sequel, just as the first film is on the verge of breaking $300 million at the global box office. We don’t yet know when the film is scheduled for release, nor do we have confirmation that any of the cast will be returning — especially considering the new film will likely take audiences through a new mystery — though it’s a safe bet Daniel Craig will reprise his central role.4. BRUNO MARS TEAMING UP WITH DISNEY FOR HIS OWN MOVIE MUSICALTwo separate recent trends in movie musicals came together this week in one news story that combines elements of both. On one hand, we have seen some very decent box office numbers in the last couple of years for musical biopics like Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman, and on the other, Lin-Manuel Miranda has both In the Heights (6/26/2020) and the filmed version of Hamilton, which will be released by Walt Disney Pictures, coming soon (10/15/2021). After “months of discussion,” Walt Disney Pictures has finalized a deal with pop star Bruno Mars for a “music-themed theatrical narrative feature that Mars will star in and produce.” The premise is being kept secret for now, but we do know that the music will mostly be new original songs that Bruno Mars will write, create, and perform. An easy guess would be that it might be a musical inspired by&nbsp;his own life story, but that’s not confirmed.5. ICE CUBE JOINS FEMALE BOXING BIOPIC FLINT STRONG(Photo by Bob Mahoney/©Warner Bros.)Last summer (6/15/2019), rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube celebrated his 50th birthday, and unlike some other Gen X actors,&nbsp;he seems to be leaning comfortably into the transition from being a “young star” (the Friday franchise, for example) to taking roles that are more age-appropriate (like say, his roles in Lottery Ticket, which was 10 years ago, and the 21 Jump Street movies). Ice Cube has signed on with Universal Pictures to co-star in their boxing biopic Flint Strong as Jason Crutchfield, the real life coach of future Olympic boxing champion Claressa “T-Rex” Shields. The movie will basically be adapting the same story as the 2015 documentary T-Rex, except that Ryan Destiny will be portraying Claressa Shields (rather than Shields playing herself). Academy Award-nominated cinematographer Rachel Morrison (Mudbound) will be making her feature film directorial debut with Flint Strong, working from a screenplay by Barry Jenkins (the director of Moonlight).6. ARE YOU THERE, HOLLYWOOD? IT’S ME, MARGARET(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)As frequently as Hollywood adapts classic novels into films, you might think that all of the biggest titles&nbsp;had already gotten the big screen treatment, but some (like, say, Catcher in the Rye) defy adaptation and&nbsp;remain unproduced. The argument can be made that one of the most famous “young-adult fiction” classics that fits in that category is Judy Blume’s Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret (which turns 50 this year). Without getting too far into the details, Blume’s novel depicted a young lady struggling to understand the changes her body was going through, and what exactly she was expected to do about them. Now, over 50 years after it was first published, Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret is now being developed by James L. Brooks and writer/director Kelly Fremon Craig (The Edge of Seventeen, Certified Fresh at 94%). The screenplay, which has reportedly received Judy Blume’s endorsement, has been sent to various studios, and a bidding war is expected to start soon.7. DOWNTON ABBEY SHOWRUNNER ADAPTING THE WIND IN THE WILLOWSThe 1906 Kenneth Grahame children’s novel&nbsp;The Wind in the Willows was adapted by Walt Disney Pictures in 1949 as one half of The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (Fresh at 93%), but the argument can be made that, unlike most other classic stories adapted by Disney in that era, that adaptation is not as fondly remembered as, say, Bambi or Pinocchio. There have been other attempts at adapting The Wind in the Willows over the years (including an animated movie featuring Monty Python stars), but so far, that one great definitive version hasn’t happened yet. We can now report that Downton Abbey showrunner and writer Julian Fellowes has signed on to adapt The Wind in the Willows for a feature film that will be shot&nbsp;at Peter Jackson’s production studio in New Zealand, with Jackson’s WETA Digital doing the CGI work on the animal characters like Mole, Rat, Toad, and Badger. Fellowes also previously worked on a stage musical adaptation of The Wind in the Willows, which debuted on London’s West End in 2016.8. SPIKE LEE TO ADAPT MUSICAL DAVID BYRNE’S AMERICAN UTOPIA(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman was one of the top contenders at last year’s Academy Awards, and he’s currently in the midst of production on his next film, the post-Vietnam War drama Da 5 Bloods, which will probably be released this year in time for awards consideration. It was a bit of a surprise, therefore, that a new project emerged this week which is also being planned for a 2020 release. Spike Lee has signed on to direct a feature film adaptation of the Broadway musical David Byrne’s American Utopia. David Byrne (the former lead singer of the Talking Heads) and&nbsp;11 other musicians are featured in the show, performing songs from Byrne’s 2018 album called American Utopia, as well songs from his career with the Talking Heads. This film is being compared by one of the producers to the 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, which also featured the Talking Heads and international musicians.9. PROMETEHUS AND IT FEMALE LEADS JOIN PETER DINKLAGE’S THRILLER THE THICKET(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Every year, there is a bit of a one-two punch in the field of independent film deals, as the Sundance Film Festival in late January is very quickly followed by the European Film Market at the Berlin Film Festival in early February. So, even as we’re still covering the deals that came out of Sundance, we’re also already hearing about big new announcements from Berlin. One of the movies that is looking to be “sold” at Berlin this year is a thriller called The Thicket, based upon a novel by Joe R. Lansdale, the mind behind Bubba Ho-Tep (Certified Fresh at 78%). Peter Dinklage has been attached to star for a while as one of his first post-Game of Thrones projects, and this week, we learned about three of his co-stars. Noomi Rapace (Prometheus), Sophia Lillis (IT), and Charlie Plummer (All the Money in the World) have all joined the cast of The Thicket. Dinklage will play a bounty hunter who is recruited by a young man (Plummer) seeking to rescue his sister (Lillis) from a violent killer named Cut Throat Bill (Rapace). The Thicket will have the same cinematographer (Galo Olivares) as last year’s Best Picture nominee Roma.Like this?

One has to presume that an actor that has probably long been seen by Marvel Studios as a major “get” is Christian Bale, who starred in Christopher Nolan’s three Batman/Dark Knight movies. Well, that’s exactly what happened this week, as we learned that Christian Bale will co-star in Thor: Love and Thunder (11/5/2021) in a currently unrevealed role. This news quickly led to speculation online about who Christian Bale might be playing, with the two most referenced characters probably being the alien Beta Ray Bill (probably voice only) and Balder the Brave, whose history in Marvel Comics is nearly as old as Thor’s. Director Taika Waititi also recently revealed that&nbsp;filming of Thor: God and Thunder is scheduled to start in Australia in August, so we can expect to hear more casting news relatively soon.Other Top Headlines1. DANIEL CRAIG’S CHARACTER WILL RETURN IN KNIVES OUT SEQUEL(Photo by Claire Folger/©Lionsgate)Daniel Craig’s run as James Bond will end in a few months with the release of No Time to Die (4/10/2020). The relative success ($250 million worldwide from a $40 million budget) of the recent whodunit mystery Knives Out&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 97%), however, is about to give Craig a new franchise to replace his old one. Writer-director Rian Johnson is reportedly already working on&nbsp;a Knives Out sequel that will feature Craig’s detective Benoit Blanc investigating a new case, implying that most of the cast will also be new. Lionsgate has not yet given the Knives Out sequel a greenlight, but Rian Johnson is reportedly hoping to start filming&nbsp;within the next year, presumably for a release in late 2021 or 2022.2. NICHOLAS HOULT JOINS MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 7 AS THE FRANCHISE’S NEXT VILLAIN(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Mission: Impossible – Fallout (Certifed Fresh at 97%), the sixth film in the franchise,&nbsp;introduced a new adversary for Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt in the form of a CIA assassin played by Henry Cavill, who in 2018 was coming off his run as Superman. For Mission: Impossible 7, Paramount Pictures is turning to another recently finished franchise for its next villain. Nicholas Hoult, who played Beast in recent X-Men movies, has signed on to join the Mission: Impossible franchise with the seventh film, which is currently scheduled for release on July 23, 2021 (one week after Space Jam 2 and Tom Holland’s third solo Spider-Man movie). Other new cast members will include Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff (both of the Marvel Cinematic Universe) and, also announced this week, Shea Whigham (Boardwalk Empire). Director Christopher McQuarrie said of Shea Whigham’s character, “You’ll never see him coming,” which is leading some to speculate&nbsp;that he may be playing magician Rollin Hand, who was played by Martin Landau on the original 1960s TV series.3. RYAN REYNOLDS CONFIRMS DEADPOOL 3 IS IN THE WORKS AT MARVEL STUDIOS(Photo by Joe Lederer/TM &amp; ©Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation)Although the 20th Century Fox version of the X-Men franchise ended last year with Dark Phoenix, there is one franchise that appears to be making the transition from Fox to Marvel Studios relatively smoothly. Talking this week to the hosts of TV’s Live with Kelly and Ryan, Ryan Reynolds confirmed&nbsp;that Deadpool 3 is now in active development at Marvel Studios, with the “whole team” (preumably screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick) now “working on it.” It is not clear how Deadpool will transition from one cinematic reality (the world of Fox’s X-Men movies) to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Deadpool’s ability to “break the fourth wall” may be all the explanation the screenwriters need. Deadpool (Certified Fresh at 85%) and Deadool 2 (Certified Fresh at 84%) came out just two years apart from each other (2016 and 2018), but with no release date for Deadpool 3 yet in 2021 or 2022, the gap between 2 and 3 will be presumably be much longer.4. TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET JOINS MUSICAL BIOPIC BANDWAGON AS BOB DYLAN(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)Following the $903 million earned in 2018 by Bohemian Rhapsody&nbsp;and the accolades this year given to Rocketman, Hollywood is certainly on the hunt for other musical biopics it can greenlight next. Jennifer Hudson is currently filming the Aretha Franklin biopic Respect (10/9/2020) and Baz Luhrmann is preparing to film an Elvis Presley biopic starring Austin Butler (Tex from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) as Elvis and Tom Hanks as Colonel Tom Parker. We can now add Bob Dylan to the list, as Timothée Chalamet (Call Me By Your Name, Little Women) this week joined an untitled Bob Dylan project (formerly called Going Electric). Not to be confused with the 2007 Bob Dylan film I’m Not There (which featured several people as Dylan), this new film will be directed by James Mangold, who previously directed the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line and most recently 2019’s Ford v. Ferrari, also based on a true story. As the working title Going Electric suggests, this new Bob Dylan film will focus on the period in his life when he switched from the acoustic guitar of a folk singer to the electric guitar of a rock star. Timothée Chalamet will next be seen in Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch and as Paul Atreides in the remake of Dune (12/18/2020).5. ANIME MASTER HAYAO MIYAZAKI COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO ASK HOW DO YOU LIVE?(Photo by Elisabetta A. Villa/Getty Images)Many anime fans were saddened when the news broke that Hayao Miyazaki was retiring in 2013 from directing feature films after The Wind Rises (Certified Fresh at 88%). Studio Ghibli recently confirmed that Miyazaki (now 79 years old) is coming out of retirement to direct an anime feature film called How Do You Live? It’s actually the first of two films that Miyazaki is now working on, but the second film is currently still shrouded in secrecy. As for How Do You Live?, it is described as being about how the 1937 novel of the same title by author Genzaburo Yoshino figures into the life of a 15-year-old protagonist and his uncle. Poignantly, Hayao Miyazaki is reportedly dedicating the film to his grandson “as his way of saying, ‘Grandpa is moving onto the next world soon, but is leaving this film behind because he loves you.'”6.&nbsp;SAM RAIMI WORKING WITH A YOUNG DIRECTOR ON A NEW EVIL DEAD(Photo by ©Universal courtesy Everett Collection)This particular story is admittedly a little light on details, but we know that fans of the franchise in question want to know any major developments. While promoting the recent reboot of The Grudge, one of its producers, Sam Raimi, revealed that he is currently “working with a young filmmaker who is writing a new Evil Dead story that he will direct. As for me… I would love to direct a new Evil Dead movie… but I’d really like to do it with Bruce [Campbell]. And he says he’s retired the character. I hope not.” Let’s set aside the possibility of Sam Raimi directing a new Evil Dead, and focus on what appears to be most likely, which is that the franchise might receive a fifth film from a new director. We can presume it’s not Fede Alvarez, who directed the 2013 reboot, or Raimi would’ve just said so. Who do you think might be the next director to take on The Evil Dead, fans? Someone completely new, or a (relatively) young director we’ve already heard of?7.&nbsp;SCOTT DERRICKSON DROPS OUT OF DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS(Photo by Andrew Schwartz/©Screen Gems)The last few weeks have seen a few rumors about Doctor Strange appear online, but it’s probably best if we start with the most recent news, which potentially ties some of these stories together. Yesterday, director Scott Derrickson (Doctor Strange, Sinister) confirmed that he is dropping out of&nbsp;directing Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, although he is staying on as executive producer, and the film is still scheduled for release on May 7, 2021. Derrickson’s departure due to “creative differences” comes at a point&nbsp;when we still don’t know much about the film’s premise (including the villain or villains), except that its stars will include Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), and Benedict Wong (Wong). Now, let’s see if a recent rumor gives us any hints. Derrickson’s departure came just two days after this piece from Comic Book Resources speculated that Marvel may be planning on introducing the original Defenders team from the comics that consisted of Doctor Strange, The Incredible Hulk, and Namor the Sub-Mariner (also rumored to appear in Black Panther 2 when it’s released on May 6, 2022). That story was a follow up to a hint from Kevin Feige earlier this month that the Doctor Strange sequel would feature a “mystery character” (whom many are predicting is probably Namor).8.&nbsp;TRAVIS KNIGHT&nbsp;BECOMES THE SIXTH DIRECTOR TO DROP OUT OF UNCHARTED(Photo by Jaimie Trueblood/©Paramount Pictures)Directors frequently drop out of movies. It’s just something that happens, sometimes due to “creative differences” (see above), but often because of scheduling problems (whether because of their own competing projects, or because the stars have other films they’re committed to). However, when a movie goes through six directors, maybe that’s just the universe’s way of saying that the movie was never meant to be. That’s exactly how many directors have dropped out of Sony’s planned movie based on their popular Uncharted video games. The latest&nbsp;is Travis Knight, who most recently directed the Transformers spinoff Bumblebee (Certified Fresh at 92%) after previously directing Kubo and the Two Strings (Certified Fresh at 97%). The reason is reportedly because the film’s star, Tom Holland, is committed to starring in his next solo movie as Spider-Man sooner than expected to make its July 16, 2021 release date.9. DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF GREENLIGHTING MOVIES FOR WARNER BROS.?(Photo by PA Images/Getty Images)For nearly as long as computers have been around, satirists and science-fiction authors have speculated about scenarios in which&nbsp;they would be used to make decisions normally made by human beings. This week, those fantasies came closer to reality with the announcement that Warner Bros has signed a deal with a company called Cinelytic to use their A.I.-driven project management system to “guide decision-making at the greenlight stage.” The article points out “the value of a star in any territory” as a determining factor in the algorithm, but presumably, many different aspects, such as genre, franchise, director, and screenwriter, could be included in the analysis. One has to wonder, however, whether an artificial intelligence would have advised Warner Bros. to greenlight, for a few examples, a $160 million Jason Momoa movie ($1.148 billion worldwide), a two part adaptation of a Stephen King TV mini-series ($1.172 billion combined), or a supervillain movie starring Joaquin Phoenix ($1.067 billion worldwide and counting).Like this?

Abrams tackles Justice League Dark, David Leitch takes on Kung Fu, two more H.P. Lovecraft adaptations are on the way, and new projects for Channing Tatum, Matt Damon, and Tina Fey.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 24, 2020 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news (the stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering stories from the last few weeks (due to the holidays) for titles like Captain Marvel 2, Justice League Dark, Kung Fu, and Mean Girls.This WEEK’S TOP STORYCAPTAIN MARVEL 2&nbsp;IN THE WORKS FOR RELEASE IN 2022(Photo by Marvel Studios)Last July at San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel Studios presented an ambitious slate for the movies and Disney+ shows that will make up Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although those movies included sequels like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (5/7/2021) and Thor: Love and Thunder (11/5/2021), there were several sequels that fans were left wondering about, although we have since heard about release dates for Tom Holland’s third solo Spider-Man film (7/16/2021) and&nbsp;Black Panther II (5/6/2022). We can now add another of those missing sequels, as Marvel Studios has officially hired screenwriter Megan McDonnell to start writing a Captain Marvel sequel starring Brie Larson. McDonnell is also one of the co-writers of the upcoming Disney+ series WandaVision starring Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch) and Paul Bettany (The Vision). The Captain Marvel sequel, which is aiming for release sometime in 2022, is expected to be set in the present day, and Marvel Studios is currently hoping to hire a female director&nbsp;for the sequel.Other Top Headlines1. TINA FEY ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR A MEAN GIRLS MOVIE MUSICAL(Photo by (c) Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)Just last year, when Dora the Explorer finally got her own live-action movie called Dora and the Lost City of Gold, the filmmakers made the curious choice to turn Dora into a teenager who grew up in the jungle and ends up in a Los Angeles high school. If that premise seemed familiar (to those who actually saw it), that might be because the same premise was used by Tina Fey for the 2004 high school comedy Mean Girls (Certified Fresh at 84%), starring Lindsay Lohan. Tina Fey took Mean Girls to Broadway in 2018 as a musical adaptation, and this week announced that Paramount Pictures is now also developing a Mean Girls movie musical. Other upcoming movies adapted from stage musicals also include In the Heights (6/26/2020), West Side Story (12/18/2020), and not-yet-produced adaptations of Little Shop of Horrors and Sunset Boulevard (both of which were also musicals based on movies).2. WILL MATT DAMON BE THE ONE TO BRING BALANCE TO THE FORCE?(Photo by © Paramount Pictures)One of the surprise box office and critical successes of late 2019 was the racing drama Ford v Ferrari (Certified Fresh at 92%), which was directed by James Mangold (Logan, The Wolverine) with leads played by Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Mangold is next expected to direct&nbsp;Timothée Chalamet in an untitled musical drama about Bob Dylan, but this week, he also recruited one of his Ford v Ferrari stars for another of his projects. Matt Damon is now attached to star in James Mangold’s film adaptation of the Don Winslow crime fiction novel The Force. Damon will star in The Force as “a NYPD detective who runs an elite crime fighting squad, but bends the law so often that he loses the line between good and evil and becomes ensnared in a pending corruption scandal.”3. BRADLEY COOPER’S LEONARD BERNSTEIN BIOPIC HEADING TO NETFLIX(Photo by John Baer/Rogue Pictures)Following a movie business pattern that’s becoming increasingly familiar, an ambitious but potentially expensive biopic is sidestepping the traditional studios and will instead be produced and distributed by Netflix (ie, The Irishman). In 2018, Paramount Pictures seemed to be close to greenlighting an untitled biopic about the famed American composer Leonard Bernstein which Bradley Cooper is attached to both star in and direct. As of this week, Paramount has dropped Cooper’s Leonard Berstein biopic, with Netflix instead stepping in to produce&nbsp;and distribute the biopic. Steven Spielberg’s Amblin remains attached to the biopic, and they are now joined by Martin Scorsese (of the aforementioned The Irishman) and Todd Phillips (The Joker), which means that the film now has direct connections to two of this year’s most discussed Academy Awards contenders. Scorsese at one point was also developing a Leonard Bernstein biopic, and Steven Spielberg’s upcoming West Side Story remake features music written by Bernstein. The project’s most obvious connection to Todd Phillips is that Bradley Cooper starred in The Hangover and its sequels, which were directed by Phillips.4.&nbsp;J.J. ABRAMS MOVING FROM STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER TO JUSTICE LEAGUE DARK(Photo by James Atoa/Everett Collection)A few years back, Guillermo del Toro was developing an adaptation of the various DC Comics supernatural characters associated with the team called Justice League Dark, before eventually moving on to movies like The Shape of Water and Nightmare Alley. The concept of a group&nbsp;of spooky magicians (John Constantine, Zatanna) and creatures (Deadman, Swamp Thing) remains an intriguing one (especially in the new horror revival era). This week, J.J. Abrams and his Bad Robot production company made an exclusive deal with Warner Media to start development on film and television projects based on Justice League Dark and its related characters. It’s not yet known if J.J. Abrams will himself be directing any of these potential TV and film projects, or which characters and titles might eventually be produced, but there are over a dozen possible projects that could be covered by this umbrella development deal.5. COLOR OUT OF SPACE NOW PLANNED AS PART OF AN H.P. LOVECRAFT TRILOGY(Photo by RLJE Films)Some “pulp fiction” horror and science fiction authors of the early 20th century like Edgar Rice Burroughs (Tarzan, John Carter) and Robert E. Howard (Conan) have had their writings adapted frequently as movies and TV shows, but one of their peers whose work has been under adapted, relative to his fame, is H.P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft’s stories have such a definite style that “Lovecraftian horror” is a subgenre itself, but most of the video games and movies called Lovecraftian haven’t actually been based on Lovecraft’s stories directly. That said, Nicolas Cage stars in this week’s Color Out of Space (Certified Fresh at 86%), an adaptation of the Lovecraft short story of the same name&nbsp;directed by Richard Stanley. Stanley revealed this week that&nbsp;he is now planning on adapting two more H.P. Lovecraft works to form a trilogy. He didn’t specify which of Lovecraft’s works might follow Color Out of Space, but three of the more famous titles that have to be seen as strong candidates are The Dunwich Horror, At the Mountains of Madness&nbsp;(which Guillermo del Toro almost adapted), and that most famous of Lovecraftian horror stories, The Call of Cthulhu.6.&nbsp;DEADPOOL 2 AND JOHN WICK DIRECTOR KNOWS KUNG FU (THE TV SHOW)(Photo by © Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Hollywood has continued to mine beloved classic TV shows from the 1970s and the 1980s for several years now (including last year’s Charlie’s Angels, and next month’s Fantasy Island). One of the most influential TV shows of the era that&nbsp;has been in development on-and-off for a long while is the 1972-1975 ABC series Kung Fu, starring David Carradine as a Shaolin monk travelling through the Wild West of the late 19th century. A movie version of Kung Fu is now reportedly back in development at Universal Pictures with action director David Leitch&nbsp;(Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde) attached to direct and produce. Universal reportedly is eager to reteam with Leitch on Kung Fu following the success last summer of his most recent film as director, Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw (Fresh at 67%).7. INDIE DIRECTOR TAKING ON THE CURSE OF THE VON ERICH WRESTLING FAMILY(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)Within the wrestling fan community, few legacies are as haunting as the Von Erich family, which some refer to as “cursed” because five of the six sons died before their father, Fritz Von Erich (a.k.a. Jack Adkisson; Von Erich wasn’t their real name). That story may soon be adapted as a movie with the news this week that independent film director Sean Durkin is now developing exactly such a movie. Durkin made his directorial debut with 2011’s Martha Marcy May Marlene (Certified Fresh at 89%), and is at Sundance this week with The Nest, starring Jude Law.8.&nbsp;WEREWOLF SOCIAL GAME GETTING ITS OWN MOVIE CALLED WEREWOLVES WITHIN(Photo by Ubisoft)Although it now takes many different forms, one of the most popular concepts in “social gaming” today is called “Werewolf.” The concept generally involves players taking secret roles either as “townies” or “villagers” (the good guys) or “werewolves” or “mafia” (the bad guys), with the two sides working against each other secretly. That concept will soon be adapted as a horror comedy called Werewolves Within, with Sam Richardson (Veep) already attached to star. Werewolves Within will be a direct adaptation of the Ubisoft virtual reality video game of the same title.9. CHANNING TATUM TO STAR IN DISNEY’S BOB THE MUSICAL(Photo by Claudette Barius/©Warner Bros.)If one only knows Channing Tatum&nbsp;from movies like 21 Jump Street, Logan Lucky, and G.I. Joe, it might be easy to forget that he first emerged as a star in the 2006 dance movie Step Up (and also showed off impressive moves in Hail, Caesar!). Channing Tatum is apparently eager to get back in the singing and dancing game, as this week, he signed on with Walt Disney Pictures&nbsp;to star in their long-in-development project called Bob the Musical. The premise of Bob the Musical is that, following a head injury, a man suddenly finds that he can hear the soundtracks of the people around him. Coincidentally, although Bob the Musical has been in development since 2004, this news of it being revived with a major A-list movie star comes just a few weeks after the premiere on January 7, 2020 of the NBC musical comedy Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist, which has the same premise, but with a female lead.Like this?

This week, that included Black Widow (5/1/2020), Mulan (3/27/2020), and the James Bond movie No Time to Die (4/8/2020), while the first Wonder Woman 1984 (6/5/2020) trailer is expected to arrive this weekend. Going into this week, we also knew that Sony Pictures was likely to do the same for the reboot/sequel we’d been calling Ghostbusters 2020, and we now have more details about that film. The title will be Ghostbusters: Afterlife, and the sequel directed by Jason Reitman (son of Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman) will likewise deal with a generational passing of a mantle (or proton pack, in this case). The family will be played by Carrie Coon (Avengers: Infinity War), Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things), and McKenna Grace (Netflix’s The Haunting of Hill House), with Paul Rudd and Bokeem Woodbine in supporting roles. You can see the first official Ghostbusters: Afterlife poster here, and read more about the premise and setting here, unless you want to wait for the trailer, which will debut online on&nbsp;Monday.Other Top Headlines1. FIRST MOVIE&nbsp;UNITING&nbsp;SCORSESE, DE NIRO, AND DICAPRIO STARTS FILMING SOONRyan FujitaniLike many directors of his stature, Martin Scorsese enjoys working with some of the same actors repeatedly. Early in his career, the actor Scorsese worked with the most was Robert De Niro&nbsp;(Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and recently, The Irishman), and in the 2000s and 2010s, that distinction more often went to Leonardo DiCaprio&nbsp;(The Aviator, The Departed, Shutter Island). For his next film, Martin Scorsese is going to double down, so to speak, by working with both Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. That film, which starts filming in March, will be called Killers of the Flower Moon, based upon a non-fiction book about a series of murders in Oklahoma in the 1920s that was one of the first major cases taken on by the then-new Federal Bureau of Investigation. Leonardo DiCaprio is expected to play one of the FBI agents, and Robert De Niro will play a local cattle rancher suspected of committing the murders of Osage tribe members.2. ALEXANDER PAYNE&nbsp;TO REMAKE&nbsp;BABETTE’S FEAST(Photo by (c) Orion courtesy Everett Collection)As good as they often are, most films in a language other than English are going to face a box office handicap in the United States, so there is a very old tradition of some of those movies being remade in English. One&nbsp;that has arguably crossed over well in the last 30 years or so is 1987’s Babette’s Feast (Fresh at 97%), a Danish film about a French woman who brings her culinary skills to a remote village unaccustomed to food that tastes good. Although he had a bit of a critical misstep with Downsizing (Rotten at 48%), director Alexander Payne&nbsp;has otherwise delivered a series of “Certified Fresh” films (including&nbsp;Election, About Schmidt, Sideways, and Nebraska), and he’s now developing an English-language “reimagining” of Babette’s Feast, which will be set in a religious community in small-town Minnesota.3. 2020 SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL COMPETITION FILMS ANNOUNCED(Photo by Amazon Studios)For pretty much every year since the 1990s, the Sundance Film Festival has become the first place that many people hear about some of the films that later go on to become awards season contenders. (This year, those films include Clemency, Hala, and Honey Boy.) We don’t have enough space here to list all of the films in Dramatic Competition next year, but we will note that the roster is one of Sundance’s most diverse ever, with over half the films being directed by people of color. Some of the more famous actors in competition in 2020 include Zazie Beetz and Winston Duke (Nine Days), Daniel Dae Kim (BLAST BEAT), Meek Mill (Charm City Kings), Elisabeth Moss (Shirley), Andy Samberg (Palm Springs), Tessa Thompson (Sylvie’s Love), and Steven Yuen (Minari).4. DAKOTA AND ELLE FANNING TO PLAY SISTERS FOR THE FIRST TIME(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Whenever two (or more) siblings become famous actors, it’s not unreasonable to expect they will eventually co-star together in a film (unless they’re, say, Shirley Maclaine and Warren Beatty). One potential sibling pairing that hasn’t happened yet is Dakota Fanning and her younger sister Elle, despite both being very prolific in the last decade or so. The movie that will finally bring&nbsp;them together —&nbsp;to play sisters, no less — will be called The Nightingale, to be directed by French actress-turned-director Mélanie Laurent. This film should not be confused with the movie that came out this August also called The Nightingale, from director Jennifer Kent (The Babadook). Dakota and Elle Fanning will play “two sisters coming of age in France on the eve of World War II [as they] struggle to survive and resist the German occupation of France.”5. FLIP A COIN AND ASK, “IS PETER SARSGAARD&nbsp;THE BATMAN‘S&nbsp;HARVEY DENT?”(Photo by Takashi Seida/©Bleecker Street)For a while now, there has been increasing evidence that 2021’s The Batman (6/25/2021) might be an adaptation of the acclaimed mini-series Batman: The Long Halloween, partly because the film will include such Bat-villains as Catwoman (Zoe Kravitz), the Penguin (Colin Farrell), the Riddler (Paul Dano), and Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), all of which were featured in The Long Halloween. If that’s true, one of the major characters from that story who hasn’t been cast yet is Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent, who, in the course of the story, begins his transformation into another Batman villain, Two-Face. We say all that as a preface to the latest casting news, as Peter Sarsgaard has joined The Batman in an undisclosed role, except that there are rumors that he’s either playing a cop or a district attorney, in which case, the secret might be that he’s playing the future Two-Face (or not… maybe flip a coin?).6. ISSA RAE TO STAR IN PERFECT STRANGERS REMAKE (NO, NOT THE ONE WITH BALKI)(Photo by © Pantelion)Although we do still get movies based on dramatic TV shows (like Downton Abbey, Charlie’s Angels, and next year’s Fantasy Island), Hollywood has pretty much given up on movie versions of half hour sitcoms. Keep that in mind over the next year or so when you hear about a new movie called&nbsp;Perfect Strangers that is not a movie version of the 1986-1993 sitcom about Greek-ish immigrant Balki and his American cousin Larry. Instead, Perfect Strangers is the title that actress and screenwriter Issa Rae (Insecure, Little) is using for her English-language remake of the Italian comedy Perfetti Sconosciuti. The film will be about a dinner party at which everyone has to keep their phones face up on the table so that all text and phone calls are public to everyone else.&nbsp; Issa Rae will next co-star with LaKeith Stanfield in the romantic drama The Photograph (2/14/2020).7. DISNEY PLANS A RETURN TO THE PLANET OF THE APES(Photo by © 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)When Disney finalized their acquisition earlier this year of the film and TV properties of 20th Century Fox, the scope of all of what they had actually acquired was almost more than what most stories could fully detail. (It’s&nbsp;reminiscent of the time&nbsp;Jason Segel revived The Muppets at Disney.). Along with Alien, Die Hard, and Home Alone, Disney also now owns the long-running science fiction franchise&nbsp;Planet of the Apes, which wrapped its reboot trilogy in 2017 with War for the Planet of the Apes. We can now confirm that Disney is indeed moving forward with plans for a new Planet of the Apes movie to be directed by Wes Ball (The Maze Runner). Having reported that, we should also note that we don’t actually know right now what a “new Planet of the Apes” movie means — whether it would be a new reboot, a direct sequel to War for the Planet of the Apes, a remake of the original film, or a movie set anywhere in the hundreds of years in between. The possibilities span from Chimpan-A to Chimpanzee.8. JOSH GAD TO STAR IN HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS SEQUEL,&nbsp;SHRUNK(Photo by © Hulu/Neon)Speaking of Walt Disney Pictures, the studio has so many possible projects they can greenlight, but not every idea is automatically a fresh one. For example, there’s Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&nbsp;and the various sequels it inspired, like Honey I Blew Up the Kid (Rotten at 40%) and Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves (Rotten at 25%). Frequent Disney star Josh Gad (Beauty and the Beast, Frozen) apparently went to Disney a while back about bringing the franchise back, with Josh Gad to play the adult son of Rick Moranis’ character from the original films. This sequel will be called Shrunk, and the director that Disney has hired to get it “embiggened” is Joe Johnston&nbsp;(Captain America: The First Avenger,&nbsp;October Sky,&nbsp;Disney’s&nbsp;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms) who made his directorial debut back in 1989 with — you guessed it —&nbsp;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.Like this?

Pictures)Earlier this year, Warner Bros and director Christopher Nolan started the promotion of next year’s Tenet (7/17/2020) in surprisingly old-school fashion, by releasing a 45-second teaser only to theaters, attached to Hobbs &amp; Shaw advance screenings. The last two weeks have obviously seen the online debuts of many 2020 films since they’re attached in theaters to either Cats or Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, but one film that was not expected this week was indeed Christopher Nolan’s Tenet. Previously thought to be something like a spy movie, Tenet now appears to be much more of a trippy Inception-style science-fiction thriller with time-manipulation elements, which also brings to mind The Matrix (also a Warner Bros. franchise that will return to theaters with The Matrix 4 on 5/21/2021). Warner Bros. has also attached a six-minute Tenet prologue to IMAX screenings of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which you can read about right here. The stars of Tenet include John David Washington (BlacKkKlansman) and Robert Pattinson, who is also currently filming another big movie for Warner Bros., The Batman (6/25/2021).Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;YORGOS LANTHIMOS&nbsp;ADAPTING HORROR WESTERN THE HAWKLINE MONSTER(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)Not counting the recent rerelease of his 2005 film Kinetta, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos is in the midst of a run of critically acclaimed films including The Lobster (Certified Fresh at 88%) and last year’s The Favourite (Certified Fresh at 93%). Next up, Lanthimos is expected to direct a long-in-development crime drama based on the Jim Thompson novel Pop. 1280, but this week, he also boarded another project that dates back to the 1970s. Yorgos Lanthimos is now in talks to direct The Hawkline Monster, an adaptation of a novel by Richard Brautigan that combines elements of cowboy westerns and the gothic horror genre as two gunslingers investigate strange goings-on. The Hawkline Monster was a long-time project for director Hal Ashby&nbsp;(Being There, Harold and Maude) until his death in 1988, and the actors he hoped to direct as the gunslingers included Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, and brothers Beau and Jeff Bridges. It’s not yet known whom Yorgos Lanthimos might cast, but one of his (relatively) frequent collaborators is Colin Farrell (The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer).2. KUMAIL NANJIANI’S&nbsp;GETS RIPPED FOR MARVEL’S THE ETERNALS(Photo by @kumailn/Instagram)When Kumail Nanjiani was first announced as being cast in Marvel’s The Eternals (11/6/2020), a safe assumption may have been that he would basically look a lot like we’ve seen him in other projects like The Big Sick, Stuber, and HBO’s Silicon Valley. After all, most previous Marvel Cinematic Universe stars look basically the same as they do in other previous movies (we’re looking at you, Paul Rudd). This week, Nanjiani took to Instagram to show off exactly what a year’s worth of Marvel-backed personal training and nutrition have done for him. (You can read about&nbsp;his training and diet here.) Nanjiani’s co-stars in The Eternals also include Angelina Jolie (Thena), Salma Hayek (Ajak), and Game of Thrones stars Richard Madden (Ikaris) and Kit Harrington (The Black Knight), but we haven’t heard yet about whether they’re that buff yet. [Ed. note: This story erroneously first reported that Kumail Nanjiani was playing Makkari in&nbsp;The Eternals. The mistake has been corrected.]3.&nbsp;AWKWAFINA, AND “HOW CHINESE FOOD FUELED THE RISE OF CALIFORNIA PUNK”(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Although it can sometimes feel like reboots, sequels, and superhero movies dominate the upper realms of studio output, the indie scene is still going, producing movies that are both original and based on other source material. For example, sometimes articles provide inspiration, as recently happened with Hustlers, which started as a New York&nbsp;Magazine piece. Just a year after her spectacular 2018 breakout (with Ocean’s Eight and Crazy Rich Asians), Awkwafina is already working on guiding her own path by producing new roles for herself, as&nbsp;she is now attached to produce and star in an untitled adaptation of this Topic.com article, titled, “How Chinese Food Fueled the Rise of California Punk.” The film will tell the true stories of how early Los Angeles punk bands in the 1970s were able to find unlikely allies in Chinese restaurants in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco (for example, bands like&nbsp;Fear, The Bags, and X played at L.A.’s Hong Kong Cafe in June, 1979). It’s not yet known if Awkwafina will be playing one of the punk rockers, or one of the young promoters who connected these two otherwise disparate communities.4. TOTALLY EXTREME JACKASS PRANKSTERS TO RETURN IN 2021(Photo by Sean Cliver/©Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Next October will mark the 20th anniversary of the October 1, 2000 debut on MTV of the groundbreaking stunt comedy series Jackass, which soon after led to a series of successful movies. Not counting Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa, the most recent Jackass movie was Jackass 3D in 2010, which came out just a year before core Jackass performer Ryan Dunn’s tragic&nbsp;death in 2011. Paramount Pictures announced this week that Johnny Knoxville and his fellow stuntmen will return for Jackass 4, which is now scheduled for release on March 5, 2021 (up against the Masters of the Universe reboot).5. THE LEGO BUILDING BLOCKS FIND A NEW TOYBOX AT UNIVERSAL PICTURES(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Despite the surprise worldwide box office success in 2014 of The LEGO Movie ($468 million), Warner Bros.’ subsequent attempts at LEGO movies were all relative disappointments, including this year’s The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part (despite being Certified Fresh at 85%). In the last several months, there has been little news from Warner Bros. about future LEGO movie plans (including a release date for the planned spinoff The Billion Brick Race), and now we know why. The LEGO Group has signed a new production deal with Universal Pictures&nbsp;to revive the franchise at a new studio, but with Warner Bros.-based producer Dan Lin still in charge. No titles have been announced for the new LEGO movie franchise, but one speculated premise involves Universal’s Jurassic World, which has also been a successful toy line for LEGO.6.&nbsp;THE REBOOTING OF STEPHEN KING MOVIE CONTINUES WITH FIRESTARTERWhether it’s a straight up two-movie reboot of IT, the Shining sequel Doctor Sleep, or the rebooted&nbsp;CBS All Access mini-series version of&nbsp;The Stand, Hollywood is very much in the business these days of dusting off old properties based on Stephen King novels. King’s influence can also be felt in movies like Get Out&nbsp;and Netflix’s Stranger Things, the first season of which bore some narrative resemblance to King’s Firestarter. Drew Barrymore, then nine years old, starred in the 1984 movie version of Firestarter, but the movie was both a box office flop ($17 million from a budget of $12 million) and critically rejected (Rotten at 35%). The horror/thriller production company Blumhouse is moving forward with plans for a Firestarter reboot with the hire this week of director Keith Thomas whose first film was this year’s The Vigil (Fresh at 75%). Thomas will be working from a screenplay adapted from King’s original novel by screenwriter Scott Teems, who is currently working on next year’s horror sequel Halloween Kills (10/16/2020).7. QUENTIN TARANTINO MAY NOT BE “BOLDLY GOING” TO STAR TREK(Photo by Francois Duhamel/©Weinstein Company courtesy Everett Collection)Just over two years ago, director Quentin Tarantino revealed one of the most surprising new projects of his career, which was that he had an idea for at least writing (if not himself directing) an R-rated Star Trek movie. At the same time, however, Tarantino has made it clear for a while now that he plans to retire from directing feature films with his tenth movie (which may or may not be Kill Bill Vol. 3). This week, Tarantino spoke to&nbsp;Consequence of Sound about his future plans&nbsp;and dropped something of a photon torpedo-sized news nugget, saying, “I think I’m steering away from Star Trek, but I haven’t had an official conversation with those guys yet.” Of course, we shouldn’t necessarily know what to read out of that statement, as Tarantino’s Star Trek project could possibly move forward under a different director, if what Tarantino actually meant is that he is stepping away from directing.8. SUICIDE SQUAD DIRECTOR REMAKING&nbsp;THE DIRTY DOZEN(Photo by Clay Enos / © Warner Bros.)Although the original DC Comics team called Suicide Squad was actually introduced in 1959, the “reformed supervillains” concept we now know was first published in 1987, and from that very beginning, it was always pretty clear that the concept was inspired by the 1967 World War II movie The Dirty Dozen, as both The Dirty Dozen and Suicide Squad involved convicts given a second chance. This week, that throughline was cemented, as David Ayer (Suicide Squad, Bright, Training Day) has signed with Warner Bros. to write and direct a “contemporized remake” of The Dirty Dozen. The exact setting hasn’t been revealed for the remake, except that it will “be contemporary with a multi-cultural diverse cast.” It’s also worth noting that Ayer’s replacement on The Suicide Squad (8/6/2021), James Gunn, himself came to A-list fame by directing Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, which had something of a Dirty Dozen premise as well (Star-Lord, Rocket, and friends all first met in a cosmic prison). Although David Ayer has a few Fresh Tomatometer scores (four), he has twice as many Rotten scores.9.&nbsp;YET ANOTHER POWER RANGERS REBOOT ALREADY IN THE WORKS(Photo by © Lionsgate)At any given point in time, it always feels like the top target for nostalgia-driven reboots is somewhere between 20 and 30 years in the past, which should mean that the 1990s should be getting the most attention (though the 1980s sequels Ghostbusters: Afterlife and Top Gun: Maverick are both coming out next summer). Part of the reason why Hollywood is not committing as much to the 1990s just yet is that some of the recent 1990s retreads just didn’t “stick their landings.” One such example was 2017’s Power Rangers (Rotten at 51%), which earned just $85 million domestically from a $100 million budget. Paramount Pictures isn’t ready to give up on the notion of a Power Rangers&nbsp;franchise, however, as they are now already developing a new reboot. Paramount has enlisted the aid of director Jonathan Entwistle, who is currently best known as the showrunner of Netflix’s The End of the F—ing World. Despite that show’s Fresh Tomatometer (93%), Power Rangers, “Mighty Morphin” or otherwise, just aren’t beloved by critics, so this is going to be a tricky proposition.Like this?

Instead,&nbsp;it&nbsp;became something of a pop culture phenomenon that helped Keanu Reeves stage a mid-career comeback, including two sequels (thus far) and continued box office success. Lionsgate has already scheduled John Wick 4 for release on May 21, 2021, but this week, we learned that the studio is also moving forward with plans for a female-centric John Wick spinoff called Ballerina about “a young female assassin who seeks revenge against the people who killed her family.” Although the premise doesn’t specify a nationality for the Ballerina, there is something of a trope involving Russian ballerinas who become super spies or assassins (mainly we’re thinking here of both Red Sparrow and Marvel’s Black Widow). The director who Lionsgate has hired to take on Ballerina is Len Wiseman, who is best known for his work with his wife Kate Beckinsale on the Underworld vampire action movies. The Ballerina character was briefly seen in John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum, played by newcomer Unity Phelan, but it’s possible/likely that another actress will star in Ballerina.Other Top Headlines1. BLACK MANTA FROM AQUAMAN ENTERING THE MATRIX 4(Photo by Warner Bros.)Less than two months after we learned that Lana and Lilly Wachowski were preparing to return to their most successful franchise, this week, we heard about the first major new casting for The Matrix 4. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who co-starred in Aquaman as the villain Black Manta, has been cast in The Matrix 4 in what is described as both a lead role and a new character (i.e. he’s not “young Morpheus”). Abdul-Mateen is the third actor attached to The Matrix 4, as both Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss are returning as Neo and Trinity. Warner Bros. has not yet announced a release date for the movie,&nbsp;but filming doesn’t start until next year, and most sources are speculating a release date sometime in 2022. As of this writing, no details about&nbsp;the film’s premise have been revealed, including whether it will be a direct sequel, prequel, or perhaps some sort of rebooting of the entire “Matrix” itself (and/or the franchise as a whole).2. HAMILTON STAR DAVEED DIGGS TO VOICE SEBASTIAN IN THE LITTLE MERMAID(Photo by Dale Robinette/© Lionsgate)The last we heard about casting for Disney’s live action remake of The Little Mermaid, One Direction star Harry Styles had turned down the offer to co-star as Prince Eric. The studio appears to still be on the hunt to replace him, but one of the other major roles that was still uncast did get filled this week. Daveed Diggs, who is probably best known for his work in the stage musical Hamilton, is now in talks to provide the voice of Sebastian the singing crab, whose signature song, “Under the Sea,” is probably the original film’s best known. Although it’s described as “live action,” this new take on The Little Mermaid is probably more likely to combine live-action and CGI characters, with Sebastian one of the most obvious examples of the latter (Flounder, voiced by Jacob Tremblay, is another). If he signs on, Daveed Diggs will be joining a cast that includes Javier Bardem as King Triton, Melissa McCarthy as the evil sea witch Ursula, and Halle Bailey as Ariel.3. WHAT COMES BEFORE TRAINING DAY? “RECRUITMENT DAY?”Without getting into third act details, there were some pretty obvious reasons why the 2001 Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke police drama Training Day (Fresh at 72%) never received a sequel, despite its box office and critical success. Having said that, it’s probably always been likely that Warner Bros. would want to&nbsp;revisit that world some day.&nbsp;One option might have been a remake, but instead, WB&nbsp;is now developing a&nbsp;Training Day prequel. Since&nbsp;the original film&nbsp;came out&nbsp;18 years ago, we can expect that the prequel will feature a new cast (in other words, no Ethan Hawke or Denzel Washington), especially since the new story will be set closer to&nbsp;30 years in the past. The Training Day prequel is expected to be set in Los Angeles in April, 1992, just before the Rodney King verdict that sparked citywide riots.4.&nbsp;BILLY PORTER MAY JOIN REMAKES OF BOTH CINDERELLA AND LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS(Photo by Jason Mendez/Everett Collection)Just a few weeks after his big Best Actor win at this year’s Emmys, Pose star Billy Porter is the focus of two new casting reports for major upcoming remakes. Both stories came out today, with the first being the news that Porter is now in talks with Sony Pictures about their Cinderella adaptation. Not to be confused with Disney’s 2015 Cinderella remake, Sony’s Cinderella will be a new musical starring Camila Cabello. It’s expected that the role Porter would play is that of the fairy godmother. The other remake he may be taking on is the third Little Shop of Horrors feature, for which he&nbsp;is reportedly being eyed to voice the plant monster Audrey II.5. JASON STATHAM REUNITING WITH DIRECTOR GUY RITCHIE FOR LE CONVOYEUR REMAKE(Photo by Warner Bros.)Far before Jason Statham became a famous movie star in blockbusters like this summer’s Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw, Jason Statham’s main claim to fame was his work in director Guy Ritchie’s Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Eighteen years later, Ritchie and Statham now appear likely to reunite for another British crime story with the news that they are both attached to an untitled remake. The original movie was called Le Convoyeur (a.k.a. “Cash Truck”) and was an ensemble crime drama about a heist scheme revolving around an armored truck company.6.&nbsp;FELICITY JONES AND SHAILENE WOODLEY&nbsp;JOIN&nbsp;THE LAST LETTER FROM YOUR LOVER(Photo by JA, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Jojo Moyes is a British author with over a dozen of popular novels to her credit to date, but so far, the only major adaptation of any of her books was 2016’s romantic drama Me Before You&nbsp;(Rotten at 55%). The next Jojo Moyes book to be adapted as a feature film will be her 2010 novel, The Last Letter from Your Lover, which begins filming next week,&nbsp;from the producers of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The story is set across several decades, as a contemporary journalist in London (Felicity Jones) discovers a series of love letters from the 1960s between characters played by Shailene Woodley and Callum Turner.7. SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON TO RETURN AS SPIRIT RIDING FREE(Photo by DreamWorks)Although DreamWorks had a huge hit in 2001 with Shrek, their next film in 2002 was a bit of a stumble, as Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron earned less&nbsp;domestically ($73 million) than its production budget ($80 million). DreamWorks kept going with the&nbsp;franchise, however, including the Netflix animated series Spirit Riding Free, which debuted in 2017. This week, Universal Pictures and DreamWorks&nbsp;announced plans for a new Spirit Riding Free movie&nbsp;for 2021, which means that it will be a movie-based-on-a-TV-show-based-on-a-movie. Universal has scheduled Spirit Riding Free for May 21, 2021, which puts it up against John Wick: Chapter 4&nbsp;and a week before Disney’s Cruella.8.&nbsp;SONY MAY SELL OFF HE-MAN AND HIS MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE TO NETFLIX(Photo by Cartoon Network)The continuing success of Netflix and the promise of its impending competitors like Disney+ and HBO Max are challenging the ways in which the major studios produce and release their films. Streaming services seem to be a smarter option for certain types of mid-range movies that might otherwise have difficulty finding large enough audiences to justify theatrical releases. Sony Pictures, for example, has been trying to get a new version of Masters of the Universe&nbsp;done for several years now, but the budget required to adapt He-Man’s fantasy adventures also might mean that it has to be a huge blockbuster to justify the expense. This week, a new theory emerged that Sony may be considering selling off&nbsp;Masters of the Universe to a streaming service like Netflix. It could lead to an excellent film, but it’s also possibly a sign of over-caution in Hollywood, and “Hollywood playing it safe” also sometimes means Hollywood being boring.9. DISNEY MAY REBOOT LIVE ACTION INSPECTOR GADGET MOVIESIn the 1980s, former Get Smart star Don Adams had something of a late career resurgence as the voice of the animated super detective Inspector Gadget. Although the show only ran for two seasons and 86 episodes, its cultural imprint was strong enough that Walt Disney Pictures produced a live-action movie in 1999 (Rotten at 21%), which was followed in 2003 by a direct-to-video sequel (Rotten at 40%). Despite the critical drubbings of those two movies, Walt Disney Pictures appears ready to reboot Inspector Gadget as a live-action movie, working with the producers&nbsp;of this year’s Aladdin remake and current Saturday Night Live writers Mikey Day and Streeter Seidell to do exactly that.Like this?

Entertainment Inc. All Rights Reserved. TM &amp; © DC Comics)The super villain origin story Joker is continuing its global box office success, which last week included reaching the $1 billion mark, making it the highest-grossing R-rated film ever. The success of Joker is made even more astounding when one considers that it had a relatively modest budget of just $55 million (considering superhero movies frequently cost upwards of $100-200 million, or sometimes more). So, it probably wasn’t particularly surprising when the news broke this week that Warner Bros. was developing a Joker sequel, but as it quickly turned out, some aspects of the story were disputable. It was reported that Todd Phillips&nbsp;had pitched Warner Bros. on a new slate of “gritty” DC Comics origin stories, but Phillips himself disputed&nbsp;how it was being interpreted, offering some clarification on what actually transpired. That, however, hasn’t stopped writers from speculating what other DC Comics villains could get Joker-esque origin stories (the obvious answer is usually Lex Luthor). As for the Joker sequel, that project is also inspiring a lot of theories, including a premise that would actually introduce another Joker who would become Batman’s villain. Warner Bros. has not announced a release date for Joker 2, but it would probably be sometime after 2021, when the studio will release&nbsp;The Batman (6/25/2021) starring Robert Pattinson. And speaking of which,&nbsp;The Batman director Matt Reeves announced via Twitter on Friday that John Turturro has joined the cast as Gotham mobster Carmine Falcone, previously played by Tom Wilkinson in Christopher Nolan’s&nbsp;Batman Begins.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;THREE OF MARVEL’S STARS CIRCLING STEVEN SODERBERGH’S NEXT(Photo by Marvel Studios)After taking a “sabbatical” in 2012 and 2013, director Steven Soderbergh&nbsp;came back with a flurry of activity that continued this year with two films on Netflix (High Flying Bird and The Laundromat) and one that has already wrapped for next year called Let Them All Talk. Soderbergh’s next film is expected to be Kill Switch, a 1950s crime drama set in Detroit from screenwriter Ed Solomon (Men in Black, co-writer of next year’s Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music).&nbsp;He is reportedly now in negotiations with three actors who are all famously known for their roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Josh Brolin (Thanos), Don Cheadle (War Machine), and Sebastian Stan (The Winter Soldier). If they sign on, the three would play criminals who plot a home invasion only to wonder if they have been set up in a double cross. Kill Switch is currently an independent production, but it’s expected to be shopped around to major studios, based on its Marvel-level star power.2. DISNEY SCHEDULES THE KING’S MAN, THE LAST DUEL, AND FOUR MARVEL MOVIES FOR 2023(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)As happens every year around this time, each major studio will be making major release date announcements soon, and this year, it started with arguably the biggest player on the field right now, Disney. Let’s start by discussing the most mysterious dates, which are for untitled Marvel movies in 2023, on February 17, May 5, July 28, and November 3. These dates are on top of the movies we know about for 2020, 2021, and 2022, and also on dates in 2022 that don’t yet have titles specified yet. We can, however, make some educated guesses about what films might be scheduled for 2022 and 2023, based on the films that haven’t been dated yet, and those titles include the sequels Ant-Man 3, Captain Marvel 2, Deadpool 3, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, as well as the reboots of Blade, Fantastic Four, and X-Men. Disney also pushed The King’s Man back from 2/14/2020 to September 18, 2020 and scheduled Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel for a platform release starting on December 25, 2020 that will expand wide on January 8, 2021.3. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY STAR JOINING MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 7 (AND PROBABLY 8)&nbsp;(Photo by Marvel Studios)It’s something of an understatement that when Disney fired (before eventually rehiring) director James Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, they also inadvertently threw the schedules of&nbsp;the film’s cast&nbsp;sort of out of whack, and we’re still seeing the ramifications. One of those available co-stars is Pom Klementieff, A.K.A. Mantis, who joined the franchise with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Screenwriter and director Christopher McQuarrie took to Twitter this week to announce that Klementieff will be joining the Mission: Impossible franchise with Mission: Impossible 7 (7/23/2021), and if we take his use of the #MI78 hashtag literally, also for Mission: Impossible 8 (8/5/2022). The tweet didn’t specify what Klementieff’s role might be, but her reply, “Mischief: accepted,” might give us a hint.4. NEXT STAR WARS MOVIE STILL SCHEDULED FOR 2022,&nbsp;STILL SHROUDED IN MYSTERY(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss recently departed&nbsp;the Star Wars project that had been scheduled for December, 2022, but Disney has confirmed that they are still scheduling a Star Wars movie for that date (12/16/2022). Having said that, Disney is reportedly not yet ready to specify who their new Star Wars director will be, and will make that announcement in early 2020. Jon Favreau, who is currently basking in warm reviews for the Disney+ series The Mandalorian (Fresh at 89%), is reportedly one of the figures whose responsibilities are being stepped up at Lucasfilm. What we do know this week, however, is that the director of the 2022 Star Wars won’t be Rian Johnson (Star Wars: The Last Jedi), and it won’t be Kevin Feige’s project either. Who do you think should direct the next Star Wars?5.&nbsp;STAR TREK 4 BACK IN THE WORKS THANKS TO LEGION AND FARGO SHOWRUNNER(Photo by Steve Mack/Everett Collection)The last few months have been sort of rough for director S.J. Clarkson. Most recently, her Game of Thrones prequel series (the one with Naomi Watts) was cancelled in favor of a different prequel series&nbsp;called House of the Dragon (about the Targaryens). But before that, back in January, we learned that Paramount had pulled the plug on&nbsp;her&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;project. This week brought Star Trek fans some good news, however, as Paramount has hired Noah Hawley, the creator of the popular Legion and Fargo TV shows, to write and direct the next&nbsp;movie. The film, known as&nbsp;Star Trek 4 for now, is expected to be a de facto continuation of the “Kelvin” storyline featuring Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, and others. It’s also worth noting that Quentin Tarantino’s R-rated Star Trek movie is also still in development, separate from this project.6. MICHAEL JACKSON BIOPIC NOW IN THE WORKS, WARTS AND ALL(Photo by ©Dream Quest Images courtesy Everett Collection)The box office success of last year’s Bohemian Rhapsody (over $900 million worldwide) is continuing to have its expected effects on other pop and rock star biopics getting developed, but as is often the case, these projects still take some time to come together. Earlier this month, we first heard about a Bee Gees biopic being developed&nbsp;by one of the Bohemian Rhapsody producers, Graham King, and now King has come aboard an even more ambitious musical biopic. Unlike Rocketman (Elton John) and the upcoming Respect (Aretha Franklin) and Elvis Presley biopic, this newest project arguably faces the biggest dramatic obstacles. That’s because Graham King has secured&nbsp;the film rights to Michael Jackson’s life story&nbsp;from&nbsp;his estate, including the rights to use all of his popular hits. Screenwriter John Logan, who worked with Martin Scorsese on the Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator, has been hired to work on the Michael Jackson story, which “isn’t intended to be a sanitized rendering of Jackson’s life.”7. DWAYNE JOHNSON’S BLACK ADAM WILL INTRODUCE JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA(Photo by Ron Phillips/©Warner Bros. Pictures)Superheroes continue to dominate the box office as we prepare to enter the 2020s, but it’s also a continuation of a pop culture phenomenon that dates all the way back to the late 1930s, which marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books. That period obviously introduced many new characters and concepts, but one of the most enduring was the “super group,” with the Justice Society of America, which brought together characters&nbsp;like Doctor Fate, The Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Hourman, Sandman, and The Spectre. This week, Dwayne Johnson revealed at a press conference for Jumanji: The Next Level that his upcoming DC Comics movie Black Adam will also introduce the Justice Society of America for the first time in a live-action feature film. Johnson did not clarify which characters will be included, or whether any casting for those roles has begun. Warner Bros. has scheduled Black Adam for release on December 22, 2021.8.&nbsp;IDRIS ELBA TO PLAY THE VILLAIN IN JAY-Z’S WESTERN(Photo by ©Columbia Pictures)Jay-Z is currently preparing for one of his first major projects as a film producer, which will be an “all-black western” for Netflix called The Harder They Fall. We’ve known for a while that the lead character would be played by Jonathan Majors (The Last Black Man in San Francisco), and this week, we learned who will play the film’s “black hat,” or the villain. That role is going to Idris Elba, who for many people first came to attention as the drug lord Stringer Bell in HBO’s The Wire. As described by Collider, “The all-black Western follows outlaw Nat Love (Majors), who rounds up his old gang to help him seek revenge when he discovers that the man (Elba) who killed his parents two decades ago is being released from prison.”9.&nbsp;ROBOCOP TO RETURN (AGAIN) IN&nbsp;ROBOCOP RETURNS(Photo by (c) Orion courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;It’s all the rage these days for a new franchise installment to disregard previous entries and dub itself a “direct sequel” to an earlier film. We saw that last year with Halloween (which dumped all movies except the 1978 original) and earlier this month with&nbsp;Terminator: Dark Fate&nbsp;(which ignored every movie after Terminator 2: Judgment Day). In 2014, MGM attempted to reboot RoboCop with a complete remake, but it didn’t perform as the studio hoped, so now they’re going the Halloween route with RoboCop Returns. As we implied, this movie will be a direct sequel&nbsp;to the original 1987 film RoboCop, which suggests that the two sequels and the 2014 remake will be skipped over. The director of RoboCop Returns will be Abe Forsythe, whose most recent film was Little Monsters (Certified Fresh at 81%), starring Lupita Nyong’o. None of the last three RoboCop movies has managed to earn a Tomatometer score above 50%.Like this?

This week, Universal solidified their relationship with Peele&nbsp;with a five-year deal with his Monkeypaw Productions that ensures they will release all of his films. This new deal includes two features that Peele himself will write and direct within those five years, but no details have been revealed about either. In addition to this new deal with Universal Pictures, Jordan Peele is also still producing The Twilight Zone for CBS, the upcoming series Lovecraft Country, and next summer’s remake of Candyman (6/12/2020).Other Top Headlines1. THIS WEEK IN TOM HOLLAND:&nbsp;SPIDER-MAN 3 AND UNCHARTED FIND DIRECTORS(Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images)Last week’s biggest news was all about the new deal between Disney and Sony for Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige to remain involved&nbsp;in future Spider-Man movies starring Tom Holland. That news, however, also broke on Friday afternoon, and the story continued to develop over the weekend after last week’s Ketchup column ran. In the seven days since, that movie, and another Tom Holland project, both received updates. Jon Watts, who directed both Spider-Man: Homecoming (Certified Fresh at 92%) and this year’s Spider-Man: Far from Home (Certified Fresh at 90%)&nbsp;is now in talks with Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures&nbsp;to return for&nbsp;a third installment (7/16/2021). It’s not yet known which villain&nbsp;will appear&nbsp;in the next Spider-Man, but the final scenes of Far from Home suggest it could be a J. Jonah Jameson-related threat, like the Scorpion or the Spider-Slayer robots. In related news, it was also revealed that Tom Holland himself played an integral behind-the-scenes role in making the new deal possible. In addition to the third Spider-Man scheduled for the summer of 2021 (7/16/2021), Holland also remains attached to star in Sony’s video game adaptation Uncharted (12/18/2020). That project has gone through a few directors now, but this week, we learned Travis Knight (Bumblebee, Kubo and the Two Strings) is now in talks&nbsp;to take it on.2. THE ORIGINAL HALLOWEEN NURSE RETURNING FOR 2020’S HALLOWEEN KILLS(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)Last year’s soft reboot of&nbsp;Halloween&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 79%) went&nbsp;a long way&nbsp;to disregard most of the sequels and establish itself as a direct follow-up to the original film, including the return of Jamie Lee Curtis but without the details established in later films. As the next two planned movies get closer to being filmed back to back (Halloween Kills on 10/16/2020 and Halloween Ends on 10/15/2021), the casting news has focused on the returns of other characters from the first movie, including the casting of Anthony Michael Hall as the adult Tommy Doyle, who was the kid Laurie Strode was originally babysitting. We can also now report that Nancy Stephens, who played Nurse Marion Chambers in the first Halloween, will also return for Halloween Kills. Nurse Marion had a crucial role in the original Halloween, as it was her car that Michael Myers stole as part of his escape from the Smith’s Grove Sanitarium. (She also had a key role in Halloween 2, but these new films act like&nbsp;that movie&nbsp;never happened.)3. DISNEY ANIMATION DEVELOPING FOUR NEW PROJECTS AS PART OF NEW INITIATIVE(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)The next movie from Disney Animation Studios is going to be this December’s sequel, Frozen II, but it appears that the studio’s future will be mostly original stories for at least the next few years. (Having said that, the only confirmed title past Frozen II is next year’s Raya and the Last Dragon, scheduled for 11/25/2020.) This week, Disney confirmed that they are now developing not one but four new animation projects as part of the “studio’s commitment to diversity and inclusion.” The four directors now working on these untitled Disney Animation projects are Carlos Lopez Estrada (Blindspotting, Certified Fresh at 94%); Suzi Yoonessi (Unlovable, Fresh at 81%); Josie Trinidad (credited as a story writer on Zootopia); and Marc Smith (a longtime animator who worked on movies like Big Hero 6 and Zootopia). No premises have been revealed about these four projects, including whether any of them might be adapted from existing classic stories.4. CLINT EASTWOOD’S RICHARD JEWELL TO BE RELEASED JUST SIX MONTHS AFTER FILMING STARTED(Photo by Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros.)Clint Eastwood is one of those directors who can get movies produced&nbsp;very quickly. This week’s news, however, is one of the most surprising examples of his expediency. After a long development phase (which included a time when Jonah Hill might have starred, before his recent weight loss), Eastwood started filming Richard Jewell, about the 1996 bombing at the Atlanta Olympic Games, in June of this year. The start date was June 14, 2019, which is one day shy of six months before the December 13, 2019 release date that Warner Bros announced for the film this week. Paul Walter Hauser, who was arguably the breakout star of I, Tonya, will star as Richard Jewell when it’s released, up against Jumanji: The Next Level and the remake of Black Christmas (which was also produced really quickly this year). Warner Bros. also released the first trailer for&nbsp;the film&nbsp;this week, which will be attached in many theaters to Joker.5. &nbsp;PIPPI LONGSTOCKING TO BE REBOOTED BY PADDINGTON PRODUCERS(Photo by ©G.G. Communications courtesy Everett Collection)Although Swedish author Astrid Lindgren’s original Pippi Longstocking books were originally published from 1945 to 1948, the super strong female children’s book character has had a decades-long legacy that&nbsp;has included multiple movies and TV shows. Having said that, the mainstream influence of Pippi Longstocking in the USA has been relatively thin for decades, and hasn’t been updated for over 20 years. That appears likely to change relatively soon with the news this week that a new Pippi Longstocking movie is now being developed by the producers of Paddington (Certified Fresh at 97%) and its even better-received sequel (Certified Fresh at 100%).6. WONDER STORY TO BE CONTINUED WITH WORLD WAR II PREQUEL WHITE BIRD(Photo by Dale Robinette /© Lionsgate)Children’s author R.J. Palacio had something of a runaway hit with her 2012 novel Wonder, which was then adapted in 2017 as a well-received live action movie&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 85%) starring Jacob Tremblay and Julia Roberts. This week, Lionsgate picked up the feature film rights to Palacio’s upcoming graphic novel called White Bird: A Wonder Story. That book will tell the World War II story of a young Jewish girl in Nazi-occupied France who would go on to become the grandmother of Julian, the central character of Wonder. It is not yet known if White Bird will be adapted as live action (like Wonder) or in animation in the style of the graphic novel.7. TREASURE ISLAND TO BE REBOOTED BY HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON DIRECTOR(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)It was just last week that we learned that the Micronauts&nbsp;adaptation (6/4/2021) will be directed by Dean DeBlois, who spent most of the last ten years working on the various How to Train Your Dragon animated movies. Now that the How to Train Your Dragon franchise is finished,&nbsp;DeBlois’ agents are apparently working double-time to find him new projects, because there’s another one this week. Universal Pictures and Mandeville Films (Beauty and the Beast, Warm Bodies) are now developing a new adaptation of the classic pirate novel Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, which was most famously adapted as a live-action Walt Disney film in 1950 (Fresh at 100%). Dean DeBlois is reportedly attached to direct the new&nbsp;film, which is being adapted by screenwriter Evan Spiliotopolous (co-writer of Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Huntsman: Winter’s War). With Micronauts already scheduled for 2021, Treasure Island will probably be released no sooner than 2022.8. SCARY STORIES TO TELL IN THE DARK DIRECTOR SET FOR DRACULA SPINOFF &nbsp;(Photo by Columbia Pictures)For trivia fans, “the Demeter” has long been a little gem to keep in one’s back pocket, as it is the name of the deserted ship on which Count Dracula sails to England from Transylvania in Bram Stoker’s original 1897 novel. Fans of movie development news might also recognize that ship’s name as part of Last Voyage of the Demeter, a long-in-development (since 2001) horror film about the on-board massacre as Dracula and his vampire cohorts killed the ship’s sailors on their way to England. Basically, Last Voyage of the Demeter attempts to fill in one of the story beats that Bram Stoker left as an untold spooky side-story. We can now report that Norwegian director André Øvredal (Trollhunter, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark) is now in talks to direct The Last Voyage of the Demeter. At one point, Viggo Mortensen was attached to star in the film as the Demeter’s captain, but it’s not yet known if&nbsp;he is still attached nearly 10 years later.9. BORAT CO-WRITER WORKING ON HOME ALONE REBOOT FOR DISNEY+(Photo by 20th Century Fox)The growth and popularity of streaming services continue to pose an interesting challenge for how they’re reported on (are they movies, are they TV, or are they something completely unrelated?), but when the streaming feature is intriguing enough, we still report on them here&nbsp;from time to time. Netflix is obviously the big player in this realm, but the Disney+ streaming app (which launches next month) is also looming out there with some very promising projects. In August, Disney CEO Bob Iger mentioned several potential Disney+ feature films, and this week, one of those was confirmed to be moving forward in development. Borat co-writer Dan Mazer is now working on adapting the original Home Alone (starring Macaulay Culkin) as a new children’s feature film for the Disney+ streaming app. The reboot is expected to be a twist on the original premise, as the young boy will now be the thief who has stolen something from a married couple (and apparently, no adult thieves are involved this time around). It’s not yet known who Disney will cast as the married couple.Like this?

[Note: This article has been updated to correct an erroneous role attribution and the implication that Wes Craven is still alive.]This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHE BATMAN FINDS ITS ALFRED AND PENGUIN(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)During the period when Jonah Hill was reportedly in talks for a villain role in The Batman (6/25/2021), various reports suggested the role was either that of the Riddler or the Penguin. Within hours of the&nbsp;announcement that Hill was no longer being considered, Paul Dano (Swiss Army Man, Love &amp; Mercy) was reported as being in talks to play the Riddler, but the casting of the Penguin remained a mystery for almost a month. In 2003, Colin Farrell costarred in Marvel’s Daredevil as the villain Bullseye opposite Ben Affleck, whose departure from The Batman eventually led to the role going to Robert Pattinson instead.&nbsp;Everything came full circle this week as Farrell is now in talks to play the Penguin as the film’s third cast villain (alongside Dano and Zoe Kravitz, who will be playing Catwoman). Andy Serkis, who appeared in a couple MCU movies as the vibranium-themed villain Klaw, is also in talks to play Bruce Wayne’s butler Alfred Pennyworth. Although three villains might seem like plenty for just one movie, Kevin Smith&nbsp;claimed last month that The Batman will be adapted from the 1996-1997 storyline Batman: The Long Halloween, which also featured Mad Hatter, Poison Ivy, the Scarecrow, and Two-Face, so there may still be more villains yet to be cast.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;DUNE SEQUEL ALREADY IN THE WORKS(Photo by Jan Thijs /© Paramount Pictures)Director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario, Blade Runner 2049) is currently working on his adaptation of Dune, the popular science fiction novel by Frank Hebert that was first brought to the big screen by&nbsp;David Lynch in 1984. That movie doesn’t come out for another thirteen months (12/18/2020), but Warner Bros. must really like what they’ve seen of&nbsp;it so far, as the news came out this week that a screenwriter has already been hired to work on the second Dune movie. That job is going to screenwriter Jon Spaihts, the sole screenwriter credited for 2016’s Passengers, who also co-wrote the Alien prequel Prometheus, Marvel’s Doctor Strange, and Villeneuve’s first Dune movie. Spaihts had been working for HBO Max as the showrunner of a Dune: The Sisterhood series, but he’s stepping down from that responsibility to focus on the second Dune&nbsp;instead. There have been reports in the past that the first new Dune movie will only adapt about half of the eponymous&nbsp;novel, so it may be more accurate to describe the second Dune movie not so much as a “sequel” as a continuation of the same adaptation (sort of like&nbsp;IT and&nbsp;IT: Chapter Two). Denis Villeneuve’s all-star Dune cast includes Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin, Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson (as Lady Jessica), and Timothée Chalamet (as Paul Atreides).2. DWAYNE JOHNSON PRODUCING TWO DIFFERENT SPORTS TRUE STORIES(Photo by HBO)Just months after producing and co-starring (as himself) in the professional wrestling true story&nbsp;Fighting with My Family (Certified Fresh at 92%), Dwayne Johnson has attached himself to at least produce two other sports movies based on true stories. The first was announced late last Friday, as Johnson will produce and star in an untitled film about UFC champion Mark Kerr in what is being described as Johnson’s “first true dramatic role.” The announcement was made at a UFC event at Madison Square Garden. Mark Kerr is a two-time UFC champion who was also the subject of a 2003 HBO documentary called The Smashing Machine. The other&nbsp;film Johnson is now producing is Unstoppable (not to be confused with the Denzel Washington/Chris Pine movie about a runaway train), a drama about undefeated three-time All-American college wrestler Anthony Robles, who was born with only one leg.3.&nbsp;CHRIS PINE, ZAC EFRON REPLACE SETH ROGEN IN TWO SEPARATE MOVIES(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)There were enough movie news stories this week to fill two editions of The Weekly Ketchup, mostly because Wednesday marked the beginning of this year’s American Film Market, which is where many non-studio movie projects try to find funding and distribution. Two of the higher profile movies this week now have different lead actors after previously being Seth Rogen vehicles. The first is&nbsp;Newsflash, which will depict the events of November 22, 1963 from the perspective of CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite as he broke the news of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination to a shocked nation. (The news of Chris Pine replacing Seth Rogen on Newsflash actually first broke in August.) Newsflash will be directed by&nbsp;Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, whose The Current War: Director’s Cut (Fresh at 60%) was just released, two years after its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September of 2017. Seth Rogen was also replaced this week by Zac Efron in another fact-based drama called King of the Jungle, as a reporter who travels to Belize to interview the controversial anti-virus software innovator John McAfee (a role that also needs to be replaced following the departure of Michael Keaton). Seth Rogen’s next film will be An American Pickle, about a factory worker who wakes up in 2019 Brooklyn 100 years after being pickled at a pickle factory.4.&nbsp;JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM CO-STARS RETURN FOR&nbsp;JURASSIC WORLD 3(Photo by Giles Keyte, Jaimie Trueblood ©Universal Pictures)Although the original Jurassic Park&nbsp;is Certified Fresh at 91%, three of the four sequels have been Rotten, including the most recent film, last year’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (48%). Universal Pictures is preparing Jurassic World 3 (A.K.A.&nbsp;Jurassic Park 6, basically) for release on June 11, 2021, with the biggest casting news to date being the impending returns of three of the first movie’s stars (Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Sam Neill). We now know that two of Fallen Kingdom‘s stars, namely Justice Smith and Daniella Pineda, will also be returning to co-star alongside Jurasic World‘s Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard.5. TERMINATOR: DARK FATE BOX OFFICE KILLS THE FRANCHISE(Photo by Kerry Brown / © Paramount)In the last&nbsp;10 years, there have been three different attempts to reboot the Terminator franchise, starting with Terminator: Salvation (Rotten at 33%) in 2009, continuing with Terminator Genisys (Rotten at 27%) in 2015, and this past week’s Terminator: Dark Fate (Fresh at 71%). That last Tomatometer is possibly sadly ironic, because the return of James Cameron as producer may have helped raised the Tomatometer score, but the film’s box office did not see a corresponding upswing. Instead, the $29 million opening weekend for Terminator: Dark Fate is being reported as a bomb that will likely mean a loss for Paramount Pictures of upwards of $120 million. According to The Hollywood Reporter, “sources close to Skydance say there are certainly no plans for another film at this point,” and some of the pundits interviewed suggested that a TV series (possibly animated) may be the next step for the Terminator franchise.6.&nbsp;SCREAM&nbsp;FRANCHISE TO BE REBOOTEDAnother franchise that has struggled for Fresh Tomatometer scores following a promising start is Scream, which started with a Certified Fresh 79% and 82% for the first two movies, followed by a Rotten 39% for Scream 3, and a barely Fresh 60% for Scream 4 in 2011. More recently, Scream found new life&nbsp;as a TV show&nbsp;for three seasons, two of which also received Rotten Tomatometer scores from critics. The Scream franchise was always one of the crown jewels of producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, and like many of their properties, the rights to Scream have new owners following the Weinstein Company’s bankruptcy. The new owners are Spyglass Media Group, and Spyglass is now developing a fifth Scream movie, but it’s not yet clear whether that film will be a reboot or just another direct sequel. Screenwriter Kevin Williamson, who penned the original&nbsp;Scream,&nbsp;Scream 2, and&nbsp;Scream 4,&nbsp;is not expected to be involved with the new movie.7.&nbsp;PARAMOUNT PLANNING 2021 RELEASES FOR PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 7 AND MY LITTLE PONY 2(Photo by ©Paramount Pictures)It’s easy to forget this little bit of trivia now, as Marvel Studios is so thoroughly associated with Walt Disney Pictures, but early movies like Iron Man were actually produced for Paramount Pictures. Losing the Marvel movies was arguably one of the biggest setbacks in recent years for Paramount,&nbsp;prompting the studio&nbsp;to look elsewhere for potential franchises, including next year’s G.I. Joe spinoff Snake Eyes (10/16/2020), as well as Sonic the Hedgehog (2/14/2020) and Rugrats (1/29/2021). This week, Paramount announced release dates in 2021 for two more sequels,&nbsp;though both follow on the heels of Rotten movies. First, Paramount has scheduled Paranormal Activity 7 for March 19, 2021, which will be coming after three other Rotten&nbsp;Paranormal Activity films&nbsp;(24% in 2012, 39% in 2014, and 14% in 2015). The Tomatometer for&nbsp;My Little Pony: The Movie (Rotten at 48%) was better, but still not Fresh, and Paramount is still scheduling a My Little Pony sequel for September 24, 2021 as well.8. FANTASTIC BEASTS 3 TO STILL BE UNLEASHED IN 2021 DESPITE GRINDELWALD DISAPPOINTMENT(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk /© 2018 Warner Bros.)Soon after the disappointing box office and Tomatometer scores of last year’s Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (Rotten at 37%), there were reports that Warner Bros. was slowing down their plans for a third Fantastic Beasts movie, which had previously been scheduled for release in November of 2020. Just shy of a year after Crimes of Grindlewald, WB confirmed this week that they are indeed moving forward with plans for a third Fanastic Beasts movie, which will start filming in early 2020 and be released on November 12, 2021, about a year after its initial release date. The focus is expected to be on Jessica Williams’ “Lally” character, with the action shifting to Brazil, following settings in New York and Paris in the first two movies. Jude Law and Johnny Depp are both expected to reprise their roles as Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald, but it’s possible that at least Depp’s role may be scaled back from what was originally planned.9.&nbsp;JAMES DEAN TO RETURN FOR HIS FOURTH FEATURE FILM 60+ YEARS AFTER HIS DEATHWhen John Cazale (Fredo from The Godfather) died prematurely at the age of 42 in 1978, it meant that he died with the sad distinction of only appearing in five feature films, all of which were nominated for Best Picture Academy Awards (and three of them actually won). Another acclaimed actor who died with just a few films to his credit was James Dean, the star of East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause, and Giant, all three of which came out in 1955 or 1956 (James Dean died on September 30, 1955). Ever since CGI and motion capture technology emerged, the issue of dead movie stars or celebrities being used (mostly to date in commercials) has been controversial, but it wasn’t until this week that a star of James Dean’s stature became attached to “star” in a new movie decades after their death. The movie in question is an independent Vietnam War-era drama called Finding Jack, about the plight of military dogs following the end of the war. The filmmakers plan on using old film footage and photographs of James Dean to create a photorealistic depiction of the actor following the acquisition of his rights from his surviving family members. The news attracted immediate reactions from stars like Chris Evans (who probably doesn’t want someone casting him in a movie 100 years from now), but the film’s director says the backlash came as a surprise to him.Like this?

Marvel Studios’&nbsp;Iron Man&nbsp;(5/2/2008) was still six months away from release (we have, of course, gotten over 20 more MCU movies since then). It was in early November of 2007, however, that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson first signed with Warner Bros. to play the DC Comics anti-hero Black Adam in what, at that time, was expected to be the Shazam! movie (Black Adam is one of Shazam’s main enemies). This week, nearly 13 years later, Johnson confirmed that he will finally start filming his Black Adam solo movie in July of 2020, which will be a few months shy of&nbsp;14 years after he first signed on. Warner Bros. has not yet announced a release date for Black Adam, but it probably won’t be until either late 2021 or sometime in 2022. The film&nbsp;will be directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who also recently directed Johnson in next year’s Jungle Cruise (7/24/2020), based on the long-running Disney theme park attraction. Meanwhile, Johnson’s next movie will be the sequel Jumanji: The Next Level, on December 13, 2019.Other Top Headlines1. JENNIFER HUDSON’S ARETHA FRANKLIN BIOPIC RESPECT ATTRACTS STAR-STUDDED CAST(Photo by Derek Storm/Everett Collection)The success last year of Bohemian Rhapsody means that we’re going to continue getting pop and rock star biopics, but Hollywood doesn’t react to new trends particularly quickly. Baz Luhrmann is currently filming his Elvis Presley movie (starring Austin Butler from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and the next movie expected to get going is Respect, based on the life of soul singer icon Aretha Franklin. Jennifer Hudson has been attached to star in Respect for a while now, but it wasn’t until this week that we learned who will be joining the film’s large ensemble cast. Those stars include six-time Tony-winner Audra McDonald, Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker, Academy Award nominee Mary J. Blige, frequent Netflix star Marc Maron, Tituss Burgess, and Marlon Wayans. MGM has scheduled Respect for release on August 14, 2020, which will be just two days shy of two years after Aretha Franklin’s death on August 16, 2018.2. ADAM DRIVER JOINS BEN AFFLECK AND MATT DAMON FOR THE LAST DUEL(Photo by Jessica Miglio/©Warner Bros. Pictures)In August, we learned that&nbsp;former screenwriting partners and Good Will Hunting costars Ben Affleck and Matt Damon would be reuniting in a historical drama called The Last Duel for director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Alien, Blade Runner). Affleck is still attached to star in the film, but this week, it was revealed that he will be taking a supporting role instead, with Adam Driver (Kylo Ren from the Star Wars movies) in early talks to take the other lead opposite Matt Damon. Damon and Driver will star in The Last Duel as two knights in 14th century France “whose bond is tested by treachery and a young woman… forced to navigate the brutal and oppressive culture of the era in order to survive.” Jodie Comer of Killing Eve has recently joined the film as the woman who comes between the two knights. Filming of The Last Duel is expected to start in early 2020.3.&nbsp;DISNEY HIRES&nbsp;CHERNOBYL CREATOR FOR&nbsp;PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN REBOOT(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)If you thought you’d seen the last of Johnny Depp’s Jack Sparrow, then… Well, you might be right. The truth is, we don’t really know. What we&nbsp;do know is that Disney is still interested in continuing the&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean franchise — or rebooting it, as it were — with producer Jerry Bruckheimer. The production hit a snag earlier this year when&nbsp;Deadpool screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick dropped out of&nbsp;Pirates, but things look to be back on track with the hiring of Craig Mazin (the Emmy-winning creator of HBO’s popular miniseries&nbsp;Chernobyl) and Ted Elliott, who co-wrote the first four films in the franchise. Whether or not any of the series regulars will make an appearance in the new film is still up in the air.4.&nbsp;ROBERT ZEMECKIS&nbsp;MAY REMAKE DISNEY’S&nbsp;PINOCCHIOAfter recently directing a few more adult-centric dramas, Robert Zemeckis (Flight,&nbsp;The Walk,&nbsp;Allied,&nbsp;Welcome to Marwen) seems to be returning&nbsp;to his kid-friendly roots with his remake of Roald Dahl’s The Witches, which Warner Bros. has scheduled for October 9, 2020. Zemeckis has not yet officially confirmed his next film as director, but according to reports this week, he may be returning to Disney for their live-action remake of their second ever animated feature, the 1940 version of Pinocchio. Although described as “live action,” it’s possible that Pinocchio&nbsp;himself may be some form of animated character, especially considering one of Zemeckis’ favored strengths over the last 15 years or so has been stop-motion in movies like The Polar Express, Beowulf, and last year’s Welcome to Marwen. If he does sign on, Zemeckis will next have to start casting Pinocchio, including finding a new Gepetto, following the recent departure of Tom Hanks from the project.5.&nbsp;CARDI B JOINS FAST &amp; FURIOUS 9(Photo by Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Getty Images)Like many pop stars and rappers before her, Cardi B is actively pursuing film roles to add to her résumé. Just a month after making her feature film debut in Hustlers,&nbsp;she has apparently found her next major film project in next year’s Fast &amp; Furious 9 (5/22/2020). This news came directly from a video that Vin Diesel posted on his Instagram this week&nbsp;with Cardi B at his side. Fast &amp; Furious 9 actually started filming in June, so it seems likely that Cardi B’s contribution to the movie will be one of the last things to be filmed.&nbsp;Diesel posted the video&nbsp;just after another singer, the Latin music star Ozuna, also joined the movie this week. As it happens, Cardi B and Ozuna released a song together in 2017 called “La Modelo,” so it’s possible that their roles in Fast &amp; Furious 9 will be directly connected.6. HUGH JACKMAN, REBECCA FERGUSON TEAM UP FOR SCI-FI ACTION MOVIE REMINISCENCE(Photo by Wilson Webb/©Warner Bros.)It has now been over two years since Hugh Jackman’s last movie as Wolverine, 2017’s Logan. Since then, Jackman has starred in a musical (The Greatest Showman), a political drama (The Front Runner), and an animated comedy (Missing Link), but what he hasn’t yet returned to are the kind of genre films that made him famous in the first place. That appears to be changing very soon with the news this week that&nbsp;he is reuniting&nbsp;with his Greatest Showman co-star Rebecca Ferguson in a science fiction “noir” called Reminiscence, which is being compared to movies like Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Inception. Set in a future Miami beset by exaggerated climate change, Reminiscence will tell the story of a private investigator (Jackman) who travels into his client’s memories to solve cases.7. ZOEY DEUTCH’S ZOMBIELAND: DOUBLE TAP CHARACTER MIGHT GET HER OWN SPINOFF(Photo by © Columbia Pictures)Last week, the horror comedy sequel Zombieland: Double Tap managed to beat the opening weekend of the original 2009 film with a domestic opening of $28.9 million. It’s not yet known if there will ever be a proper Zombieland 3 (unless everyone involved wants to wait another 10 years), but director Ruben Fleischer is already talking about another direction he’d like to take. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Fleischer said, “I would love to do a Madison standalone movie,” referring to the new character played in Zombieland: Double Tap by Zoey Deutch. If such a movie does get made, it’s not known if some of the other Zombieland characters would also return.&nbsp;THR&nbsp;also revealed this week that an earlier Zombieland 2 screenplay would have featured a de facto&nbsp;Ghostbusters reunion in which Dan Aykroyd would’ve played a zombie version of himself.8.&nbsp;JARED LETO LIKELY DONE AS THE JOKER (AND HE’S NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT)(Photo by Clay Enos / © Warner Bros.)Continuing an obvious trajectory, we can now confirm that the DC Comics movie Joker has passed previous record-holder Deadpool to become the top-grossing R-rated movie of all time&nbsp;with a global total of $788 million (and counting). The funny thing is that Warner Bros. may never have seen this particular Joker as a&nbsp;box office juggernaut, especially if this narrative is to be believed,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Warner Bros. really gave Joker a relatively smaller budget because it was seen as more of a “one-off” experiment. One major player who, however, did see this coming was Jared Leto, who played Joker in the first Suicide Squad movie and who reportedly actively tried to get Warner Bros. not to make Joker with Joaquin Phoenix instead of him. Arguably burying the lede, the Hollywood Reporter’s story ends with, “At this point, sources say Leto’s days as the Joker likely are over.” That being said, it’s not yet confirmed that Joaquin Phoenix will return to play Joker again in some future movie, or if someone else instead might take over.9.&nbsp;JOHNSON FAMILY VACATION&nbsp;SEQUEL&nbsp;JOHNSON FAMILY CELEBRATION&nbsp;IN THE WORKS(Photo by (c) Fox Searchlight/courtesy Everett Collection)When Maleficent: Mistress of Evil opened to relatively disappointing box office numbers, some writers argued that the sequel was hurt&nbsp;by what’s called the “five-year curse,” which argues that sequels that are released five years later (like say, The LEGO Movie 2 and Godzilla: King of the Monsters) come out too late after the first movie. The problem with that argument, of course, is that there are other examples, like last week’s Zombieland: Double Tap (which came out 10 years after the first), which do just&nbsp;fine despite an even longer gap.&nbsp;The other possibility is that the timing has less of an impact than just the quality of the sequels, or other factors in demand from the target audience. That leads us to the news that Cedric the Entertainer is now producing and will return as the star of a sequel to his 2004 comedy Johnson Family Vacation (Rotten&nbsp;at just 6% on the Tomatometer). The sequel will be called&nbsp;Johnson Family Celebration, and will be set “nearly two decades” later, which suggests a release around 2022 or 2023.Like this?

NIGHT SHYALAMAN WORKING ON MYSTERIOUS MOVIES FOR 2021 AND 2023(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis / © Universal)On top of everything else in&nbsp;M. Night Shyalaman’s Split&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 77%), the most memorable scene in the movie may have come at the end when it was revealed that&nbsp;it was secretly set in the same world as Shyamalan’s Unbreakable&nbsp;(Fresh at 70%), which, of course, subsequently led to this year’s Glass (Rotten at 37%). Regardless of how Glass itself was received, the box office success of these movies is a reminder that, like Quentin Tarantino, Shyamalan remains one of the few directors whose name carries marquee value. So, it’s little surprise that this week, Universal Pictures moved quickly to schedule two “mystery” projects from M. Night Shyamalan for release on February 26, 2021 and February 17, 2023. The year 2023 is relatively unclaimed so far, but that date in early 2021 is the week before the reboots of Mortal Kombat and Masters of the Universe, both of which are staked out on March 5, 2021. Although no details are given for Shyamalan’s new projects, they are described as being “original” movies.&nbsp;One possibility has been suggested by Collider, which is that these movies could be a longer story split in two. M. Night Shyamalan has now directed three movies within a “superhero” framework. What genre might&nbsp;he take on next?Other Top Headlines1. FIRST DETAILS ABOUT JOAQUIN PHOENIX’S NEXT FILM AFTER JOKER(Photo by Warner Bros.)Joker (currently Fresh at 75%) doesn’t come out for another two weeks, but its future seems pretty bright at this point, following the film’s top prize win at the Venice Film Festival&nbsp;and with&nbsp;opening weekend box office predictions in the $90 million range. Joaquin Phoenix will probably emerge from all of this with an even more prospects for major studio prestige films, but this week&nbsp;he signed on to work with an acclaimed independent director first. Joaquin Phoenix’s next film after Joker will be an untitled independent drama with a secret premise from writer-director Mike Mills. This will be Mills’ fourth film following Thumbsucker, Beginners (which gave Christopher Plummer his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and 2017’s 20th Century Women (for which Mills received a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award nomination).2. MICHAEL FASSBENDER JOINS TAIKA WAITITI’S&nbsp;NEXT GOAL WINS(Photo by Abbot Genser/TM and ©Copyright Fox Searchlight Pictures)With dozens of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and various Marvel movies from both Fox and Sony, it’s nearly inevitable nowadays that actors and directors with Marvel credentials will end up working together on other projects. Taika Waititi, for example, is fitting two non-Marvel movies in between Thor: Ragnarok and Thor: Love and Thunder (11/5/2021). The first of those two is Jojo Rabbit (currently Fresh at 75%), in which Taika Waititi plays a ridiculous daydream version of Adolf Hitler, and the second will be a soccer underdog true story drama called Next Goal Wins. This week, Michael Fassbender, whose run as Marvel’s Magneto finished this year with Dark Phoenix, signed on to star&nbsp;in Next Goal Wins as soccer coach Thomas Rongen,&nbsp;who in 2011 became coach of the American Samoan team in their effort to qualify for the World Cup. Waititi reportedly is now casting actors of Fa’afafine heritage to play the American Samoan soccer players. Next Goal Wins is also based upon the 2014 documentary of the same title, which won several awards, including Best Documentary Feature at the British Independent Film Awards in 2014.3.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN MARGOT ROBBIE: FOOLS DAY&nbsp;AND COMPETITION FOR&nbsp;BARBIE(Photo by Andrew Cooper / © Columbia Pictures)In addition to appearing in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (Certified Fresh at 85%)&nbsp;and starring in upcoming films Bombshell (12/20/2019) and Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (2/7/2020), Margot Robbie is staying super busy in her role as producer. It was just last week that we learned Robbie is producing a Tank Girl reboot, but this week, we&nbsp;found out she&nbsp;will also executive produce (and co-star in a supporting role) a feature-length adaptation&nbsp;of a comedy short film called Fools Day (which you can watch on YouTube right here), about&nbsp;a class of 4th graders who accidentally kill their teacher (Margot Robbie) while playing an April Fools Day prank. Cody Blue Snider, who wrote and directed the original short film, will also co-write and direct Fools Day as her feature film debut. Robbie is also attached to star in the long-in-development Barbie movie (5/8/2020), and this week, that project got some indirect competition in the form of Dream Doll, a biopic about Barbie creator Ruth Handler, which will be co-produced by Rita Wilson.4. BOB ODENKIRK JOINS NEW THRILLER FROM JOHN WICK&nbsp;WRITER(Photo by Michele K. Short/AMC/Sony Pictures Television)While many of his contemporaries became big stars much earlier, the career of Bob Odenkirk&nbsp;has been more of a “slow burn” since the 1980s, although his status has definitely grown with the success of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul (all four seasons are Certified Fresh at 97% or higher), in which he stars. “Above-title billing” might be just around the corner for Bob Odenkirk with the news this week that the previously mysterious “Untitled Universal Event Film” scheduled for August 14, 2020 will be a revenge thriller called Nobody, starring Bob Odenkirk. Screenwriter Derek Kolstad, who wrote John Wick and John Wick: Chapter Two (and co-wrote the third film), is the mastermind behind Nobody, which is described as&nbsp;as a “summer thriller” in which Odenkirk will play a “a suburban dad, overlooked husband, and all-around nobody [with] a long-surpressed rage that explodes after two thieves break into his house, propelling him on a brutal path that will uncover dark secrets he fought to leave behind.” (So, basically, Nobody sounds like an adult Home Alone through the lens of John Wick, Falling Down, and Straw Dogs?)5. DIRECTOR LEE DANIELS’ NEXT HISTORICAL DRAMA: THE UNITED STATES VS BILLIE HOLIDAY(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)This year marks 47 years since the 1972 biopic Lady Sings the Blues (starring Diana Ross as jazz singer Billie Holiday) was released and eventually received five Academy Award nominations. It’s been six years now since director Lee Daniels produced and directed Lee Daniels’ The Butler (Fresh at 72%), but he’s now getting ready for his next film, which will be called The United States vs Billie Holiday. Instead of a full biopic, the drama will focus on a drug sting orchestrated by the Federal Department of Narcotics led by an agent with whom Billie Holiday had “a tumultous affair.” Singer-songwriter Andra Day has been attached to star in The United States vs Billie Holliday for a while now, and this week, we learned that she will be joined by Trevante Rhodes (Moonlight), Garrett Hedlund (Mudbound), Natasha Lyonne (Russian Doll), and Da’Vine Joy Randolph (of Netflix’s upcoming Dolemite is My Name). The United States vs Billie Holiday is reportedly inspired by the 2015 bestselling book&nbsp;Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs by Johann Hari.6. FUNKO POP! VINYL FIGURES GET AN ANIMATED FILM(Photo by Bloomberg/Getty Images)In 2014, Warner Animation had a surprise success with The LEGO Movie (Certified Fresh at 96%), which earned over $469 million worldwide, even if the subsequent sequels didn’t do quite as well. Part of the formula behind the success of The LEGO Movie was that, like the toys it was based upon, the film was able to “borrow” characters from franchises like DC Comics, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars. Another popular franchise that is built largely upon the popularity of other pop culture items is Funko’s Pop! vinyl figures, and like LEGO before them, the Funko Pop! figures are also now getting their own movie from Warner Animation. As with LEGO, Warner Bros. and Funko have a long history of licensing brands like Batman and Harry Potter, and the Funko Pop! movie is expected to draw heavily from those in-house properties. It will be a while before we get a release date for the Funko Pop! movie, but in the meantime, future Warner Animation movies will include Scoob (5/5/2020), Tom &amp; Jerry (4/16/2021), and Space Jam 2 (7/16/2021).7. WWE PARTNERING ON “MONSTER WRESTLING” ANIMATED MOVIE RUMBLE FOR 2020(Photo by Glen Wilson /© Netflix)Much like the Bob Odenkirk movie above, until this week, Paramount Animation also had an untitled film scheduled for next summer on July 31, 2020. We can now report that the movie will be called Rumble, and that it will be a joint project with WWE Studios (Fighting with My Family). Rumble will be “set in a world where monster wrestling is a global sport and monsters are superstar athletes,” with a voice cast that includes Will Arnett (Batman from The LEGO Batman Movie), Terry Crews (TV’s Brooklyn Nine-Nine), Tony Danza, and WWE wrestling stars like Becky Lynch and Roman Reigns. Other Paramount Animation movies scheduled for 2020 include Sonic the Hedgehog (2/14/2020), The SpongeBob Movie: It’s a Wonderful Sponge (5/22/2020), and Clifford the Big Red Dog (11/13/2020). In related news, this week Paramount Animation also unveiled their new “Star Skipper” opening animation that will appear before these 2020 movies.8. THIS WEEK IN REMAKES: THE CRAFT, HOUSE PARTY, AND SET IT OFFEven if you set aside comic book movies and various big budget franchises like Disney, Fast &amp; Furious, James Bond, and Star Wars, the hunt for original movies each year is still made difficult by the abundance of remakes, and there’s no end in sight. To illustrate the point, this week’s headlines included remakes&nbsp;of&nbsp;The Craft, House Party, and Set It Off. First up, the cast for The Craft was announced, with Gideon Adlon, Lovie Simone, and Zoey Luna joining the previously announced Cailee Spaeny (Bad Times at the El Royale). Then, the&nbsp;House Party remake&nbsp;announced it will now be directed by Calmatic, the director of the video behind the hit country/rap song “Old Town Road” by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus. That movie&nbsp;has been in the mix for a while now, as it’s one of the projects that LeBron James is producing, along with Space Jam 2 (7/16/2021). Finally, the 1996 heist movie Set It Off is also getting remade, which Issa Rae (Insecure) is now developing at New Line Cinema, with Issa Rae likely to take one of the starring roles.9. THE&nbsp;SOCIAL MEDIA WHIRLWIND AROUND&nbsp;THE&nbsp;PRINCESS BRIDE REMAKE&nbsp;(Photo by TM and Copyright © 20th Century Fox Film Corp. All rights reserved)Every once in a while, we get&nbsp;a cautionary tale about&nbsp;the power of social media, frequently at the expense of “old school” figures who lack the foresight to realize how badly their words can be blown out of proportion. Let’s start with this Variety profile of longtime TV producer Norman Lear, who also went on to produce movies like The Princess Bride and Fried Green Tomatoes. In that piece, there are some quotes from Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra, including this one: “We have so many people coming to us saying, ‘We want to remake this show or that show… very famous people whose names I won’t use, but they want to redo ‘The Princess Bride.'” And that right there was enough to explode online, as people took to their phones and computers to voice their disapproval&nbsp;of the mere thought of remaking the beloved 1987 fantasy comedy. Those expressing said disapproval included Jamie Lee Curtis and the original film’s star Cary Elwes, who simply said, “There’s a shortage of perfect movies in this world. It would be a pity to damage this one.” The bottom line: there are people in Hollywood who think&nbsp;The Princess Bride should be remade, and those people should be ashamed of themselves.Like this?

We’ve known for a while that The Little Mermaid will be directed by Rob Marshall as his next Disney project after last year’s Mary Poppins Returns. We can now report that Ariel, The Little Mermaid herself, will be played by R&amp;B singer Halle Bailey, who with her sister Chloe Bailey is one half of the singing group Chloe x Bailey. Before that, we learned&nbsp;last Friday that Melissa McCarthy is in early talks to play the evil sea witch Ursula, though rapper/singer Lizzo also put her name out this week as an Ursula candidate this week, and this piece suggests other possibilities. Disney didn’t stop there, however, as the studio also cast Awkwafina (Ocean’s Eight) and Jacob Tremblay (Room) as the voices of the animated animal characters Scuttle the seagull and Flounder (who’s not a flounder), respectively. Disney hasn’t scheduled The Little Mermaid yet, but it will come after Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (10/18/2019), Mulan (3/27/2020), and Jungle Cruise (7/24/2020).Fresh Developments1. THE FLASH MOVIE BACK IN THE RACE WITH IT CHAPTER TWO DIRECTOR(Photo by Warner Bros.)When Warner Bros announced their DC Comics movie plans in 2014, The Flash was originally scheduled for release last year in 2018. Of course, that plan also had Justice League Part Two coming out this year, and Cyborg and Green Lantern coming out in 2020, none of which is happening. This week, however, Warner Bros did get The Flash back on track with the news that director Andy Muschietti (Mama) is in talks after delivering the two IT movies for WB subsidiary New Line Cinema. (2017’s IT was Certified Fresh at 85%, and IT Chapter Two comes out&nbsp;on September 6, 2019.) Ezra Miller is still attached to reprise his role from Justice League, and the screenplay is being adapted by Christina Hodson, whose credits include Bumblebee and next year’s Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) (2/7/2020). The Flash had at one point been expected to be an adaptation of the Flashpoint storyline from the comics, but that may no longer be the source material. The Flash doesn’t currently have a release date, but it will be at some point after Joker (10/4/2019), Birds of Prey (2/7/2020), Wonder Woman 1984 (6/5/2020), and The Batman (6/25/2021).2.&nbsp;IT’S NOW OR NEVER: WHO MIGHT STAR IN THE ELVIS PRESLEY BIOPIC?(Photo by Wilson Webb/TriStar)Following the staggering success of Bohemian Rhapsody and the “pretty good” numbers for Elton John’s Rocketman, the musical biopic has come back in a big way. Jennifer Hudson is attached to star as Aretha Franklin in Respect, MGM recently started development on a Boy George movie, and Universal is also developing a “jukebox musical” based on the the songs of Prince. Director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge, The Great Gatsby) is currently developing an untitled Elvis Presley biopic, and we now know which five actors are in the running for the role. Namely, they include&nbsp;Ansel Elgort (Baby Driver, The Fault in Our Stars), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Quicksilver in Avengers: Age of Ultron), Miles Teller (Whiplash, The Spectacular Now), Austin Butler (MTV’s The Shannara Chronicles), and One Direction’s Harry Styles. Teller is the oldest at 32, while Styles and Elgort are tied for youngest at 25. Harry Styles and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are English; the other three are from California (Butler), New York (Elgort), and Pennsylvania (Teller). Baz Luhrmann is expected to make his decision by the end of July.3. JUMANJI: THE NEXT LEVEL TRAILER REVEALS THE SEQUEL’S NEW TWIST(Photo by Sony Pictures Entertainment)This week, as Spider-Man: Far from Home hits theaters, Marvel’s partner on the film released the first trailer for one of their last big movies for 2019, the sequel Jumanji: The Next Level. Jack Black, Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson, and Nick Jonas will all be reprising their roles from 2017’s Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (Certified Fresh at 76%). We’ve known for a while that two of the bigger stars joining the franchise will be Danny DeVito (Dumbo, Batman Returns) and Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon, Saw), and the trailer reveals how they fit into the movie. The 2017 film focused on four teens who transformed into video game avatars, but this time around, Dwayne Johnson will represent Danny DeVito’s character, and Kevin Hart will represent Danny Glover’s. Sony Pictures will release Jumanji: The Next Level on December 13, 2019, up against the horror remake Black Christmas, and the week before Cats, Fair and Balanced, Super Intelligence, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.4. CRAZY RICH ASIANS STAR HENRY GOLDING BRACES FOR VIETNAM’S MONSOON(Photo by Sanja Bucko /Warner Bros. Pictures)It’s not yet been even a year since English-Malaysian actor Henry Golding made his big screen debut with last year’s Crazy Rich Asians (Certified Fresh at 91%), but he’s already getting ready to star in his fifth film. Golding’s second film was A Simple Favor, number three will be this year’s Last Christmas, and his fourth film will be Guy Ritchie’s The Gentlemen, co-starring Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, and Matthew McConaughey. The fifth will be called Monsoon, and it will be a drama set in modern Vietnam, with Golding playing a British man of Vietnamese descent who travels to&nbsp;the country with his parents’ ashes and meets an American woman with whom he begins a romantic relationship.Rotten Idea2. MARK WAHLBERG REPLACING CHRIS EVANS IN INFINITE(Photo by Patti Perret/Paramount Pictures)Although Chris Evans wasn’t the only Avengers star to leave the franchise with Avengers: Endgame, he was the first to announce his departure (twice, even). One of this week’s new trailers is for the ensemble-led mystery Knives Out, and Evans will also star in the Netflix drama The Red Sea Diving Resort. The most ambitious post-Marvel project that Evans has been attached to is probably the reincarnation thriller Infinite. This week, however, Evans was confirmed to be departing Infinite, with Mark Wahlberg now in talks with Paramount Pictures to star instead. Wahlberg, 48, will play “troubled young man haunted by memories of two past lives [who] stumbles upon the centuries-old society and decides to join their ranks.” Only five of Wahlberg’s last 15 feature films,&nbsp;have earned Fresh Tomatometer scores.1. DISNEY CANCELING ALIEN NATION REMAKE FROM LOVING DIRECTOR(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)It’s something of an easy target situation to unconditionally call remakes “Rotten,” but obviously, the director is also a big factor. Consider, for example, writer and director Jeff Nichols, whose films have never received a Tomatometer score&nbsp;lower than a&nbsp;Certified Fresh 83% (Midnight Special), and have reached as high as a Certified Fresh 97% (Mud). Nichols signed on with 20th Century Fox in 2016 to remake the 1988 science fiction police thriller Alien Nation, but this week, Disney officially pulled the plug on the remake as part of their consolidation of their recently acquired Fox properties. James Caan and Mandy Patinkin co-starred in the original Alien Nation as a human police detective and his alien partner, respectively. Disney has notably put Alien Nation on hold instead of putting it into turnaround, which prevents the project from being shopped around to other studios. It’s not yet known which film Jeff Nichols will direct next instead.Like this?

Brown.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 23, 2019 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news (the stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering such titles as Birds of Prey, Fast &amp; Furious 9, and The Matrix 4.This WEEK’S TOP STORYKEANU REEVES IS ON BOARD FOR THE MATRIX 4What Do We Know About The Matrix 4?The Matrix 4 is officially happening! Here’s everything we already know about Neo’s upcoming return.Posted by The Rotten Tomatoes Channel on Thursday, August 22, 2019Ever since George Lucas ended his original Star Wars story cycle with Return of the Jedi in 1983, the trilogy has been perceived as the most popular way to sequelize a popular film. That is, until someone realizes that a perceived demand is still out there, and then nicely tied-together trilogies lead to movies like Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and most recently, Toy Story 4. The surprise success of The Matrix (Certified Fresh at 88%) in 1999 quickly led to sequels&nbsp;The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions (which ended the trilogy on a downtick both critically and at&nbsp;commercially). This week, four years after the disappointment of Jupiter Ascending (Rotten at 27%), Lana Wachowski confirmed that The Matrix 4 is moving forward with both Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss returning as Neo and Trinity. Filming is expected to start in early 2020, and already this week, two key creative roles were filled: Wachowski is&nbsp;working with returning concept artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce, which&nbsp;suggests a unity in creature and production design. But in one departure, original trilogy cinematographer Bill Pope will be replaced by John Toll, who won back-to-back Academy Awards in 1994 and 1995 for Legends of the Fall and Braveheart (Toll’s next film is Harriet). Warner Bros hasn’t announced a release date for The Matrix 4 yet, but the filming start date suggests sometime in 2021 or 2022.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;BOND 25 OFFICIALLY TITLED&nbsp;NO TIME TO DIE(Photo by Francois Duhamel/©Columbia Pictures)After being called just “James Bond 25” since the 2015 release of the 24th film, Spectre, this week we finally learned that the title will be No Time to Die. This makes Daniel Craig’s final film as James Bond the fourth movie in the franchise with the word “Die” or “Dies” in the title, following Live or Let Die, Tomorrow Never Dies, and Die Another Day, breaking the tie with the opposite words (You Only Live Twice, Live and Let Die, and The Living Daylights). The title also plays as a reference to the news last month that Captain Marvel co-star Lashana Lynch will be playing a new Agent 007 (ostensibly after James Bond retires). MGM has scheduled No Time to Die for release on April 8, 2020, as currently the highest profile film scheduled that month (its closest big competition is Disney’s Mulan on March 27, 2020).2.&nbsp;MARGOT ROBBIE’S BIRDS OF PREY TO FEATURE JOHN WICK-STYLE ACTION(Photo by Clay Enos / © Warner Bros. )One way that Marvel Studios changed the perception of who could direct “action movies” was by working with a series of directors whose backgrounds were not in the genre. We’re thinking here of comedy director Peyton Reed on the two Ant-Man movies, horror director Scott Derrickson and Doctor Strange, the indie directors of Captain Marvel, and even the Russo brothers, who were best known for directing TV’s Community before taking on Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Warner Bros. has recently followed suit with Joker (from the director of The Hangover) and&nbsp;Shazam! (from the director of Lights Out). Next year’s Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) (2/7/2020) was likewise directed by Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs), who we learned this week will be assisted in reshoots of some action sequences by director Chad Stahelski. Before making his directorial debut in 2014 with John Wick (he also directed the sequels), Stahelski worked as stunt and fight coordinator on dozens of movies, including V for Vendetta, The Hunger Games, Speed Racer, and The Wolverine.3.&nbsp;HOBBS AND SHAW VACUUM IN FAST AND FURIOUS 9 TO BE PARTLY REPLACED BY MICHAEL ROOKER(Photo by Marvel Studios)Now that Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham’s Hobbs and Shaw (Fresh at 67%) characters have successfully been spun off into their own franchise (presumably), they’re not expected to be returning in next year’s Fast and Furious 9 (5/22/2020).&nbsp;As with many other franchises that have run this long, Universal regularly introduces new characters in each new film, and this week, we learned that the new additions to&nbsp;Fast and Furious 9 will include fan favorite Michael Rooker. (In addition to playing Yondu in the first two Guardians of the Galaxy movies, Rooker also co-starred in&nbsp;The Walking Dead.) Although the nature of his role wasn’t otherwise specified, Rooker will reportedly play a new character named “Buddy.” Michael Rooker is the ninth film’s second major new cast member following John Cena, who signed on for Fast and Furious 9 in June.4. CHRIS PRATT’S NEXT TO BE SCI-FI THRILLER GHOST DRAFT(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)At various points in the last year or so, Chris Pratt was expected to be filming both the (possibly shelved) action movie Cowboy Ninja Viking and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (not shelved, but it now has to wait for director James Gunn to finish The Suicide Squad). Instead, the next live-action movie (not counting Pixar’s Onward) Pratt will star in will probably be the science fiction thriller Ghost Draft. The premise involves a future war that humanity is losing against an alien race, leading to a plan that involves using time travel to recruit soldiers from the past (possibly our present) to fight in the present (our future) — time travel is so much fun to explain, isn’t it? Chris Pratt’s fellow Marvel co-star J.K. Simmons (A.K.A. J. Jonah Jameson) is now in talks to play Pratt’s father, while&nbsp;Betty Gilpin (from Netflix’s GLOW), Sam Richardson (HBO’s Veep), and stand-up comedian Theo Von are also in talks to co-star in Ghost Draft, which will be directed by Chris McKay (The LEGO Batman Movie).5.&nbsp;ROBERT RODRIGUEZ&nbsp;SINGS TO NETFLIX, WE CAN BE HEROES(Photo by Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images)David Bowie’s song “Heroes” didn’t even crack the Top 100 in the USA when it was released in 1977,&nbsp;but the song has had a much longer legacy since, including frequent use in movie trailers. Netflix is also now planning a superhero movie called We Can Be Heroes (from the song’s chorus), which will be written, produced and directed by Robert Rodriguez, who is coming off his recent futuristic action film, Alita: Battle Angel (just this side of Fresh at 60%). The project already has a cast attached including Priyanka Chopra (TV’s Quantico), Pedro Pascal (HBO’s Game of Thrones), Boyd Holbrook, Sung Kang, and Christian Slater. The premise itself involves “the children of Earth’s superheroes [after their parents have been kidnapped by alien invaders]…. [who] must team up and learn to work together if they want to save their parents and the world.”6.&nbsp;TRACY MORGAN JOINS&nbsp;COMING 2 AMERICA(Photo by Ali Paige Goldstein/Paramount)Although other studios continue to pull movies out of December, 2020 release dates (including Disney, who moved&nbsp;Cruella to the summer of 2021 this week), Paramount Pictures is sticking with Coming 2 America, which is now one of only five movies scheduled that month. (The other four are The Croods 2, Dune, West Side Story, and the video game adaptation Uncharted.) The sequel to the 1989 hit comedy Coming to America already had stars both old (Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, John Amos, and James Earl Jones) and new (Leslie Jones, KiKi Layne, Wesley Snipes), but a few more names were added this week as well. Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock star Tracy Morgan was the biggest of the new stars announced, as he will be playing the “hustler” brother of Leslie Jones’ character, who is the mother of Prince Akeem’s son, the result of a one-night-stand. Rotimi (TV’s Power) also signed on for a role this week, as did Nomzano Mbatha and Garcelle Beauvais, who is actually reprising one of her first movie roles ever, as a “rose petal princess.”7.&nbsp;KERRY WASHINGTON AND STERLING K. BROWN TO PAIR UP AS SHADOW FORCE(Photo by Eli Winston, Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)We don’t yet know which studio will win the auction, but a new action project called Shadow Force is now attracting bids across Hollywood. Compared to a “fresh take” on the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie romantic action movie, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, the Shadow Force pitch comes with two of TV’s most popular stars already attached: Kerry Washington (Scandal) and Sterling K. Brown (This is Us). The details pretty much end there, but if we’re meant to make direct comparisons to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, then Brown and Washington might be playing contract killers who are both married to each other, and who are hired to kill&nbsp;each other (but that’s just a guess).8.&nbsp;LIAM NEESON FOLLOWING UP HIS SNOW PLOW MOVIE WITH THE ICE ROAD(Photo by Maria Marin/©Sony Classics)It might be pure coincidence that these two films&nbsp;share similar themes, but in the same year that Liam Neeson’s snow plow driver action movie Cold Pursuit (Fresh at 70%) was released, the Irish star is taking on a new movie that could easily live in the same universe. Neeson is now signed to star in the action adventure The Ice Road as a big rig ice road driver “who, after a remote diamond mine collapses in the far northern regions of Canada, must lead an impossible rescue mission over a frozen ocean to save the trapped miners.” The Ice Road will be directed by Jonathan Hensleigh, whose career Tomatometer (mostly as screenwriter) sports nine Rotten scores and just one Fresh one for 2011’s Kill the Irishman. It’s not yet known if Cold Pursuit and The Ice Road will be followed by a third “cold weather driving” movie to complete a thematic trilogy (perhaps about driving a pack of sled dogs?).9. MARVEL AND SONY PARTING WAYS OVER FUTURE SPIDER-MAN MOVIESWhat Will Happen If Spider-Man Leaves the MCU?What will the MCU look like without Spider-Man? We’re breaking down what the Sony/Disney split means for fans.Posted by The Rotten Tomatoes Channel on Wednesday, August 21, 2019If you follow online movie news at all (and by reading this far into this column, we suspect that you do), then you already know that Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures are parting ways over future plans for Spider-Man movies. Having said that, hopefully we can still give you some details you may not be aware of. First, to elaborate, Kevin Feige will no longer be involved with Sony’s plans for Spider-Man movies after Sony reportedly rejected an offer from Disney to share costs (and profits) in a 50/50 deal. Sony then responded with a series of Twitter responses that used words like “mischaracterized” and “disappointed,” which may have been a response to criticism from some fans who were quick to side with Disney, Feige, and Marvel Studios. It’s worth noting that Sony Pictures was also able to deliver&nbsp;both Venom and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse without Feige’s help, which might have fueled their resolve. This week’s news also came just a few days after Spider-Man: Far from Home became Sony’s biggest box office hit ever. As for Tom Holland, he’s expected to continue to star as Sony’s Spider-Man (his contract still has two movies left, plus he could re-sign), and he’s also working with Sony again soon as the star of their video game adaptation&nbsp;Uncharted (12/18/2020). As for Sony’s plans, they retain their movie rights to over 900 Spider-Man-related Marvel characters, including Jared Leto’s Morbius (7/31/2020), Tom Hardy’s Venom 2 (10/2/2020), and other movies in development, like Kraven the Hunter, Black Cat, Silk, Silver Sable, The Sinister Six, and the sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.Like this?

So, as Sony Pictures prepares for the no-brainer sequel (Venom earned over $856 million globally), all three of the directors they’ve reportedly met with have had experience working on action movies with significant computer animated characters. Of the three, the biggest name is Andy Serkis, who has built an impressive career as a motion capture actor with roles like Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies, and other roles like King Kong, The Adventures of Tintin, and as Snoke in the recent Star Wars movies. One of those roles was also as Caesar the chimpanzee leader in Rise of the Planet of the Apes and its sequels, and as it happens,&nbsp;Rupert Wyatt, who directed that first Apes reboot movie, is also one of the directors that Sony Pictures is considering. The third reported name is Travis Knight, whose most recent film was last year’s Transformers prequel Bumblebee, but what he’s really best known for are the Laika stop-motion animated movies like ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls, and Kubo and the Two Strings. It’s expected that Sony Pictures is planning to release Venom 2&nbsp;on October 2, 2020, with Woody Harrelson likely to co-star as the symbiote-powered serial killer villain Carnage. [UPDATE: As of Monday, August 5, Serkis has confirmed he’s officially on board as director for Venom 2.]Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;ROBERT DE NIRO JOINS LEONARDO DICAPRIO FOR SCORSESE’S NEXT FILMIn just the last week, we’ve seen both the release of Leonardo DiCaprio’s latest film (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Certified Fresh at 84%), and the first full trailer for Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, starring Robert De Niro. Also, this week, a news story broke that ties together all three of them, as De Niro is in talks to join DiCaprio&nbsp;in Scorsese’s next film, Killers of the Flower Moon. Based on the 2014 nonfiction book, Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, Scorsese’s film will tell the story of the investigation into the murders of over 20 Native Americans in Oklahoma after oil is found on their tribal lands. Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio have both starred in multiple Scorsese films (9 and 5, respectively), but Killers of the Flower Moon will be the first to feature both at the same time.2. AVA DUVERNAY CONFIRMS DARKSEID WILL APPEAR IN&nbsp;NEW GODS(Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/Paramount Pictures)Earlier this month, Marvel Studios confirmed that their next movie after Black Widow (5/1/2020) will be their adaptation of Jack Kirby’s The Eternals (11/6/2020), featuring stars like Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kumail Nanjiani, and Richard Madden (Robb Stark from Game of Thrones). The Eternals is also arguably in a “dueling movies” situation, because Warner Bros. is simultaneously also developing its own Jack Kirby movie, New Gods, with Ava DuVernay (Selma, A Wrinkle in Time) attached to direct. This week, DuVernay confirmed that the villains in New Gods will include Darkseid and the Female Furies. DuVernay also said that one of the actors in her Netflix series When They See Us will “99%” be cast in New Gods, but that show also has a huge cast, so it’s tricky to guess who she might be talking about. As for the Darkseid confirmation, this article points out that Ava DuVernay and Warner Bros. have a “Thanos problem,” as Darkseid and Thanos have always shared a lot in common, but Marvel Studios has already well established Thanos as a movie character, and Darkseid could easily be seen as a villain-come-lately.3.&nbsp;DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS MIGHT BE NEXT UP FOR GAME NIGHT (DIRECTORS)It’s become nearly cliche for TV shows to feature their characters bonding over the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons, whether it be on Community, The Goldbergs, or most famously, Stranger Things. If we turn the clock way back 19 years to 2000, however, we can actually see that this arguably started with Freaks and Geeks, which had an episode where James Franco’s character bonds with the titular “geeks” over D&amp;D. (Incidentally, it’s also the year that brought us the first — and notoriously panned — film adaptation of the game, as pictured above.) One of those kids was played by John Francis Daley, who went on to become a screenwriter with partner Jonathan Goldstein on movies like Horrible Bosses and Spider-Man: Homecoming, and they also co-directed 2015’s Vacation&nbsp;and last year’s Game Night. Paramount Pictures is reportedly now in talks with Daley and Goldstein to direct the long-in-development reboot of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which moved to Paramount in 2017 after Warner Bros. was unable to get a reboot starring Ansel Elgort going earlier this decade. John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein were also formerly attached to direct DC Comics’ The Flash.4. CHRIS PINE TO STAR AS ANCHORMAN WALTER CRONKITE IN NEWSFLASH(Photo by Warner Bros.)Very few people are ever likely to confuse comic actor Seth Rogen with Star Trek star Chris Pine, but thanks to the wonders of makeup, they now have the same role in common. Until recently, Rogen was in talks to star in the historical drama Newsflash as CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite as he was covering the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. The news this week, however, is that the role will instead go to the aforementioned Chris Pine. If Pine signs on, he will be joining Mark Ruffalo, who has long been attached to star as producer Don Hewitt, who went on to found 60 Minutes in 1968. Chris Pine’s next big movie will be Wonder Woman 1984, which comes out next summer (6/5/2020).5. JASON MOMOA OUT FOR REVENGE IN NETFLIX’S SWEET GIRL(Photo by Warner Bros.)Before his blockbuster success last year with Aquaman, Jason Momoa starred in the Netflix series Frontier from 2016 to 2018. While he is signed to return for the Aquaman sequel, that movie isn’t scheduled until December 16, 2022, so he’s got plenty of time before&nbsp;it starts filming. With that in mind, Momoa&nbsp;has signed on to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;a revenge thriller for Netflix called Sweet Girl.&nbsp;He will also produce Sweet Girl, in which he will play “a husband who vows to bring justice to the people responsible for his wife’s death while also protecting his daughter.” Momoa will also co-star in next year’s Dune remake (11/20/2020) as Duncan Idaho.6. JARED LETO JOINS DENZEL WASHINGTON AND RAMI MALEK IN LITTLE THINGS(Photo by Netflix)After playing The Joker in the first Suicide Squad movie, Jared Leto will soon become the latest actor to star in a Marvel movie (by way of Sony) as the “living vampire,” Morbius, in just under a year (7/31/2020). This week, Leto also started early talks with Warner Bros. to join their crime thriller Little Things. If&nbsp;he signs on, he will play a serial killer who’s crimes are being investigated by a small town sheriff played by Denzel Washington and another detective from Los Angeles played by Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody). Little Things will be directed and written by John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side, The Founder, Saving Mr. Banks), whose most recent film was Netflix’s The Highwaymen.7.&nbsp;BEN AFFLECK IS IN DEEP WATER WITH HIS NEW EROTIC THRILLER(Photo by Universal Pictures)In the ten years or so between 1983 and 1993, director Adrian Lyne gave the world a few major hits (Flashdance, Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal), but then two stumbles (Unfaithful and his Lolita remake) seemed to put his career as a director on a 17-year hold. That said, Lyne is finally preparing to return with another erotic thriller called Deep Water&nbsp;that seems to share a lot of themes with his earlier films. Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas (“Joi” in Blade Runner 2049) are both in talks to star in Deep Water as a married couple who spice up their relationship by allowing each other to take other lovers, until their “mind games” take a dark turn when people around them start turning up dead. Just last week, Affleck also&nbsp;joined his old friend Matt Damon in a historical drama called The Last Duel.8.&nbsp;REESE WITHERSPOON’S FIRST SCIENCE FICTION DRAMA WILL BE PYROS(Photo by Bob Mahoney/©Warner Bros.)Like most movie actors of her status, Reese Witherspoon has appeared in movies from a wide range of different genres,&nbsp;including psychological horror (American Psycho), supernatural comedy (Little Nicky), and animated science fiction (Monsters vs Aliens). This week, we found out that the latest genre Witherspoon will expand into will be (live action) science fiction with a movie called Pyros. Witherspoon is partnering with frequent X-Men producer Simon Kinberg on the new film, in which she will star as one of “a group of augmented people who are fitted with indestructible fire suits that are fused to their spines [who] work for a corporation that recovers objects for wealthy people when their houses are burning.”9. MARK WAHLBERG GOING TO THE DOG(S) WITH ARTHUR THE KING(Photo by Patti Perret/Paramount Pictures)Although there still aren’t that many movies about (live action) cats, their canine counterparts don’t have that problem, as almost every year sees at least one movie&nbsp;centered on dogs, with the most recent example being A Dog’s Journey (Rotten at 49%) and The Art of Racing in the Rain set to hit theaters next week. The latest star to sign on for a “doggie picture” is Mark Wahlberg, who is now attached to star in Arthur the King, an adaptation of the novel Arthur: The Dog Who Crossed the Jungle to Find a Home, based on a true story. Wahlberg will play a Swedish “adventure racer” named Mikael Lindnord who “won the hearts of millions when he and his team adopted Arthur, a badly wounded but big-hearted stray dog who tagged along with them during an epic endurance race in Ecuador.”Like this?

Avengers: Endgame marked an end for Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr.’s runs, but there hasn’t been any suggestion that Chris Hemsworth was done quite yet as Thor, which seemed to be confirmed this week with the news that the God of Thunder will be first MCU character to receive a 4th solo film. Taika Waititi, who directed the space opera adventure Thor: Ragnarok (Certified Fresh at 93%) has been hired to write and direct Thor 4. Waititi had been expected to direct the long-delayed live action Akira (for release on May 21, 2021) next, but Warner Bros. has put Akira on hold “indefinitely” again. Taika Waititi’s next film will be this year’s Jojo Rabbit (10/18/2019), in which he plays a young boy’s imaginary friend, Adolph Hitler (yes, really).Fresh Developments1. CAPTAIN MARVEL CO-STAR&nbsp;MAY BE THE NEW 007 IN&nbsp;BOND 25(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / © Marvel)The&nbsp;upcoming&nbsp;Bond 25 is expected to be Daniel Craig’s final film as the sixth actor to portray Eon’s&nbsp;007, and over the 50+ years of the James Bond franchise, we’ve gotten extremely used to equating&nbsp;his name with the famous call sign.&nbsp;This week, though, the world learned that may not necessarily be the case. British actress Lashana Lynch, who co-starred earlier this year in Captain Marvel, has reportedly joined Bond 25 as both the first female&nbsp;the first person of color to adopt the 007 codename. According to an unnamed source, “There is a pivotal scene at the start of the film where M says, “Come in 007”, and in walks Lashana who is black, beautiful and a woman,” following James Bond’s retirement in Jamaica. Bond 25 will feature several returning cast members, including Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Jeffrey Wright, and as the villain Blofeld, Christoph Waltz, but the news of Lynch’s potential role in the story caught fire across the internet. Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek will also be joining the franchise as a new villain when Bond 25 is released next year on April 8, 2020.2. LADY BIRD DIRECTOR GRETA GERWIG&nbsp;TAPPED FOR&nbsp;BARBIE&nbsp;MOVIE(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)The toy company Mattel has been attempting to get a live action Barbie movie going for a few years now, including an effort at Sony that almost&nbsp;featured first Amy Schumer, and then Anne Hathaway. The Barbie movie eventually moved to Warner Bros. late last year, at which point their “Harley Quinn” actress Margot Robbie also started talks to star in the film. At first, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins had also been in talks to helm&nbsp;Barbie, but this week, Warner Bros. instead hired&nbsp;Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Certified Fresh at 99%), who will also adapt the screenplay with Lady Bird co-writer Noah Baumbach. The premise isn’t known yet, but it’s expected that it will no longer be anything like the story it would have been with Schumer or Hathaway. Warner Bros. had previously scheduled Barbie for May 8, 2020, but this news may mean it will be delayed.3.&nbsp;EMMA STONE AND BRAD PITT MAY CO-STAR IN&nbsp;DAMIEN CHAZELLE’S BABYLON(Photo by Jef Hernandez, Gregorio Binuya/Everett Collection)We’re now less than two weeks from the release of Quentin Tarantino’s ninth film as director, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which is his tribute to the Los Angeles of the 1960s. Tarantino is not the only director revisiting the Hollywood of the past, though, as La La Land director Damien Chazelle is preparing for his next film, Babylon, which will be set in the silent era of the 1920s. Emma Stone is now in talks to reunite with Chazelle on Babylon, which might start filming before her starring role in Disney’s 101 Dalmatians prequel Cruella (12/23/2020). In a move&nbsp;that would really tie Babylon to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Brad Pitt is also reportedly “circling” the film. Babylon will reportedly be an R-rated movie in the three hour range&nbsp;with a budget of between $80 million and $100 million, with Lionsgate and Paramount among the studios vying to distribute.4. POP SINGER HARRY STYLES MAY JOIN DISNEY’S THE LITTLE MERMAID AS PRINCE ERIC(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)In just a few weeks, we’ve gone from not knowing when Walt Disney Pictures might ever remake The Little Mermaid to having almost every major role cast (pretty much everyone but King Triton and Sebastian the singing crab). All in the same week, actually, Disney started negotiating with Melissa McCarthy (as the octopus sea witch Ursula), Awkwafina (as Scuttle the seagull), Room star Jacob Tremblay (as Flounder the fish), and Halle Bailey as the title character of Ariel. We can also now report that Disney is in early talks with One Direction pop singer Harry Styles to star as the film’s romantic male lead, Prince Eric. The live action remake of The Little Mermaid will be directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago, Mary Poppins Returns).5. BAZ LUHRMANN FINDS HIS ELVIS(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)Following the staggering success of Bohemian Rhapsody and the “pretty good” numbers for Elton John’s Rocketman, the musical biopic has come back in a big way. There are several similar projects now in the works, including biopics for Boy George and Aretha Franklin (with Jennifer Hudson attached), and a Mamma Mia! style jukebox musical featuring the music of Prince. Right up there with The Beatles, one of the biggest stars never to receive a big budget Hollywood biopic is the “King of Rock and Roll,” Elvis Presley, but that’s exactly what Moulin Rouge director Baz Luhrmann is getting ready to work on next. In the same week as the&nbsp;Little Mermaid casting news earlier this month, we also learned about the various contenders to play Elvis (including Ansel Elgort, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Miles Teller, and One Direction’s Harry Styles, who will apparently co-star in The Little Mermaid instead.) Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis will be Austin Butler&nbsp;of MTV’s The Shannara Chronicles, with Tom Hanks already attached to co-star as Colonel Tom Parker.6.&nbsp;GIRLS TRIP DIRECTOR TAKING OVER SPACE JAM 2(Photo by Michael Gibson/©Universal Pictures)Until this week, Space Jam 2 was to have marked the big budget studio debut of director Terence Nance, whose first film was the 2013 independent drama An Oversimplification of Her Beauty. Citing “differing visions,” Warner Bros. and producer and star LeBron James have now&nbsp;hired director Malcolm D. Lee to direct Space Jam 2. Although his most recent film, Night School, received a Rotten Tomatometer score at 27%, Lee’s two prior films both received Certified Fresh scores: Barbershop: The Next Cut at 90% and Girls Trip at 91%. We don’t yet know which NBA stars will be joining LeBron yet, but Don Cheadle signed on last week. Warner Bros. has scheduled Space Jam 2 for July 16, 2021, which is the week after Indiana Jones 5, and the week before Mission: Impossible 7.7. FIRST TEASER TRAILER REVEALS WHAT THE HUNT IS ABOUT (SPOILER: IT’S ABOUT A HUNT)(Photo by Universal Pictures)There was once a time when people often didn’t know that a movie even existed,&nbsp;much less what the film was about, before the first trailer came out. These days, however, mainstream&nbsp;cinema is dominated by sequels, remakes, and adaptations of comics and video games, the news of which break months or years ahead of time (for example: this column). In that climate, then, it’s rather refreshing when we have a movie like The Hunt (9/27/2019), which was just described as a “political thriller” until the teaser trailer was released this week. As it turns out, the title was quite literal, as the movie now appears to be nearly a remake of the classic story and film, The Most Dangerous Game, as twelve strangers find themselves being hunted by the uber-wealthy on a private estate.Rotten Idea2.&nbsp;ARCADE CLASSIC SPACE INVADERS GETTING AN ADAPTATION(Photo by Producers Distribution Agency/Courtesy Everett Collection)This year’s Pokémon Detective Pikachu made Tomatometer history with the first Fresh rating (at 67%) ever for a mainstream video game movie. While it’s great that this long-standing Rotten record was broken, it’s only a mere step in the right direction for the genre;&nbsp;“video game movies” still trend towards Rotten, even though we continue to hope that will change someday. One of the oldest video game franchises is Space Invaders, which celebrated its 40th anniversary last year in 2018,&nbsp;Warner Bros. has been developing a Space Invaders movie for several years now. This week, the Space Invaders movie moved forward with the hiring of screenwriter Greg Russo, who is also working on another video game movie, the Mortal Kombat reboot (3/5/2021). Good luck, Greg!1. STRANGER THINGS‘ BILLY REVEALS POWER RANGERS TO BE REBOOTED YET AGAIN(Photo by © Lionsgate)Ostensibly, one of the reasons a movie might cast several young up-and-comers is that if there are ever sequels, the franchise might benefit from getting in early on the careers of promising young stars. For example, just two years&nbsp;after the 2017 Power Rangers reboot, its cast seems to be in a pretty great place, as the Pink Ranger was played by Naomi Scott (Jasmine from Aladdin), and the Red Ranger was played by Dacre Montgomery (Billy from Stranger Things). (And that’s without mentioning Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa, or Barry star Bill Hader as the voice of Alpha 5.) So, it was a crazy headscratcher this week when Dacre Montgomery revealed that Power Rangers is being rebooted once again, with another completely new cast. Although it is true that the 2017 reboot received a Rotten score at 50%, that was actually a step up from the older films, like the first movie in 1995, which was Rotten at 37%.Like this?

Oh, and they're remaking Face/Off.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 13, 2019 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news (the stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering such titles as&nbsp;The Suicide Squad,&nbsp;Face/Off, Major Matt Mason, Mission: Impossible 7, and Tank Girl.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJAMES GUNN REVEALS FULL CAST OF&nbsp;THE SUICIDE SQUAD(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images)After writer-director James Gunn was dismissed by Disney from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 over some controversial tweets — and before he was then re-hired for the project — Warner Bros. and DC swooped in to secure his talents for a new Suicide Squad movie. We learned later that the film would be a reboot instead of a sequel, and casting announcements began to roll in, starting with Margot Robbie (as Harley Quinn) and Idris Elba (who specifically isn’t replacing&nbsp;Will Smith as Deadshot), and eventually including returning stars Viola Davis, Jai Courtney, and Joel Kinnaman. More casting announcements came fast and furious after that, but on Friday, just as this article was set to publish, Gunn himself took to Twitter to officially confirm the full cast of The Suicide Squad for the first time, along with the words “Don’t get too attached.” In other words, we can fully expect that not all of the cast will survive to the end of the movie. The Suicide Squad starts filming this month, with a scheduled release date of August 6, 2021.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;JOAQUIN PHOENIX’S JOKER WILL NEVER MEET ROBERT PATTINSON’S THE BATMAN(Photo by Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros., Warner Bros.)It’s a good time to be bad for Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker, which currently has a Tomatometer score of 76%, won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival,&nbsp;and is projected to make around $90 million at the box office when it opens in October. All of that already has pundits speculating on Phoenix’s chances of replicating Heath Ledger’s Academy Awards win as the Joker in The Dark Knight. So, it’s not unreasonable to wonder if&nbsp;he might reprise the&nbsp;role&nbsp;to square off&nbsp;against Robert Pattinson’s The Batman (6/25/2021), either in that film or in future sequels. Well, Joker director Todd Phillips was asked that exact question this week, and he replied with, “No. Definitely not.” Asked again a few days later, he said basically the same thing, but with a few more words, “I don’t see it connecting to anything in the future. This is just a movie.” It’s possible that the reason why Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker won’t tie in to other DC Comics movies is that, as far as we currently know, the DCEU version of the Joker is still Jared Leto’s take from Suicide Squad. After all, Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn is still very much in play, as she’s reprising the role in Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (2/7/2020) and, as noted above, presumably in James Gunn’s&nbsp;The Suicide Squad.2. MARVEL’S AGENT CARTER STAR JOINS MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE FRANCHISE(Photo by The Weinstein Company/courtesy Everett Collection)Although many other franchises have come and gone since the first Mission: Impossible&nbsp;in 1996, last year’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout was&nbsp;the sixth in the series, and Paramount Pictures has already scheduled Mission: Impossible 7 (7/23/2021) and Mission: Impossible 8 (8/5/2022). Part of how the M:I&nbsp;franchise has stayed relevant is through a steady flow of new cast members, including Michelle Monaghan and Simon Pegg in M:I III&nbsp;and Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin in M:I – Rogue Nation. The first new cast member to be announced for Mission: Impossible 7 is British actress Hayley Atwell, who probably remains best known for playing Marvel’s Peggy Carter, as seen in both Captain America: The First Avenger&nbsp;and in the much-missed ABC series, Agent Carter. Neither Atwell nor director Christopher McQuarrie revealed in their announcements&nbsp;the nature of her new character, though one could speculate&nbsp;(and this writer is) that she might be playing a British counterpart to those led by Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt.3.&nbsp;HAILEE STEINFELD LIKELY TO JOIN THE MCU AS NEW HAWKEYE KATE BISHOP(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Although she was not primarily an archer when first introduced in 2005, the Marvel Comics character Kate Bishop would go on to become the second Hawkeye and the star of one of Marvel’s most popular titles when Matt Fraction’s Hawkeye series debuted in 2012. Before Avengers: Endgame was released this year, it seemed from the trailers that maybe Kate Bishop would be featured in that film (the young female archer in the trailers turned out to be Clint Barton’s daughter instead). Instead, the character’s introduction to the MCU was confirmed at SDCC&nbsp;to be in the upcoming Disney+ series Hawkeye. That show isn’t scheduled to be released until the fall of 2021 (and indeed, the writer wasn’t even hired until this week), but Disney and Marvel may already be in talks with their Kate Bishop actress. An offer has reportedly been made to 22-year-old Hailee Steinfeld, whose recent films have included Pitch Perfect 2, Pitch Perfect 3, Bumblebee, and&nbsp;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, in which she voiced&nbsp;Spider-Gwen. In addition to the Disney+ series, it’s also very possible that Steinfeld could reprise the role in future MCU movies.4. UNIVERSAL CLASSIC MONSTERS TO RETURN AS DARK ARMY(Photo by Universal Pictures)It was just two years ago that Universal Pictures brought together a cast of stars to promote their new “Dark Universe” cinematic universe. That, however, was before the first movie in that proposed franchise, The Mummy, was released to both critical and box office disappointment. Earlier this year, Variety ran a story that confirmed that the Dark Universe concept was “dead,” following the news last year that Bride of Frankenstein had been cancelled. (The Invisible Man, starring Elisabeth Moss, is still coming out next year, but not as part of a cinematic universe.) Instead, it appears the next time the various Universal Classic Monsters will co-star in the same movie together will be in something called Dark Army, which started as a pitch from comedic writer-director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy). It’s not yet known if Feig’s frequent collaborator Melissa McCarthy will appear in Dark Army, and if she does, what role she would play (Bride of Frankenstein, perhaps?). In addition to various (but not yet confirmed) Universal Classic Monsters, Dark Army will also feature some new monsters.5.&nbsp;CHIWETEL EJIOFOR TO FOLLOW SCAR IN THE LION KING WITH ANOTHER VILLAIN(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/TM and Copyright ©Fox Searchlight Pictures)It sounds like reprising one of Disney’s most iconic villains as Scar in this year’s CGI remake of The Lion King may have been something Chiwetel Ejiofor enjoyed, because this week, the British actor signed on for another “heel” role. Ejiofor has joined Mark Wahlberg in the Paramount action thriller Infinite (which Icelandic actor Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson also joined this week). Mark Wahlberg will play a man haunted by memories of past lives who then discovers that he is part of a secret society of people who have been using their past memories to shape history for centuries. Infinite (8/7/2020) started as a project for Chris Evans, as one of his first post-Captain America roles, but he subsequently departed the project and was quickly replaced by Wahlberg.6. MARGOT ROBBIE REMAKING POST-APOCALYTPIC COMEDY TANK GIRL(Photo by Warner Bros.)As the old expression goes, “what I really want to do is direct,” but another smart play for today’s movie stars is to become a producer. Margot Robbie started her LuckyChap Entertainment production company in 2014, and since then, she’s produced I, Tonya, and is also producing the upcoming Barbie, Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), and Gotham City Sirens. This week, it was confirmed that Robbie is also producing — and is likely to star in — a reboot of the post-apocalyptic comedy Tank Girl. Lori Petty starred in the first Tank Girl movie (Rotten at 38%) in 1995, which was, like Robbie’s movie will be, based on the British comic book series. Tank Girl depicts the adventures of an outlaw tank pilot with a mutated kangaroo boyfriend (played in the first movie by a heavily made-up Ice-T), supported by counterparts like Jet Girl and Sub Girl (you get one guess each as to how they each get around). This week, Robbie hired director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte (of her recent film Dreamland) to direct her version of Tank Girl.7. TOM HANKS STILL ATTACHED TO STAR IN 1960S ACTION FIGURE MOVIE MAJOR MATT MASON(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Walt Disney Studios)The 1960s action figure character Major Matt Mason remains fairly obscure for most people, but it has a very influential fan in the form of Tom Hanks. Although he is now 63 years old, Hanks has long been attached to star in a Major Matt Mason movie, and this week, it was confirmed that Hanks is still attached to star, despite his age. Introduced in 1966 at the height of the space race, Major Matt Mason is an American astronaut who lives on the Moon. Tom Hanks’ involvement actually started in 2012 (when he was a relatively spritely 56) as a film that would have been directed by Robert Zemeckis, but it is now being adapted by screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, who worked with Tom Hanks on The Da Vinci Code&nbsp;and its sequel Angels &amp; Demons. Of course, it’s possible that Tom Hanks&nbsp;advanced age&nbsp;might be part of the story, perhaps in the form of a twist in which Matt Mason has been living on the Moon since the space race years.8.&nbsp;CHANNING TATUM PRODUCING MOVIE BASED ON CHINA’S ZOMBIE BROTHER(Photo by Claudette Barius/©Warner Bros.)China is increasingly becoming a factor in the box office prospects of Hollywood films, but it’s still relatively rare that those movies are actually based on Chinese properties. That, however, may be slowly changing, as suggested by one new project based on the Chinese webcomic and animated series&nbsp;Shi Xiong (Zombie Brother). It’s not yet known if he will also star in Zombie Brother, but Channing Tatum is producing the live-action film version. The first step came this week with the hiring of director Todd Strauss-Schulson (Isn’t It Romantic?). Although movies featuring magic or the supernatural frequently face censorship in China, Zombie Brother skirts that issue by explaining zombies through science.9.&nbsp;DEFINITIVE 1990S ACTION MOVIE FACE/OFF TO BE REMADE(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Although it feels like the 1997 action thriller Face/Off&nbsp;is now primarily referenced in jest, the film starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta actually maintains an impressive Certified Fresh Tomatometer score of 92%. That, however, doesn’t necessarily help this week’s news, as&nbsp;it’s commonly held that&nbsp;the best candidates for remakes are movies that were flawed the first time around. That’s right, Paramount Pictures is now developing a remake&nbsp;of Face/Off, about the highly unlikely scenario&nbsp;in which an FBI agent and a terrorist end up wearing each other’s faces after a complicated surgery. Paramount Pictures has hired screenwriter Oren Uziel, who recently worked for Paramount on their movie version of Sonic the Hedgehog, which begs the question as to whether the remake will have to be delayed several months&nbsp;after audiences reject the CGI faces they see in the first trailer.Like this?

Some box office pundits argued (and some didn’t) that the surprise success of Black Panther was a factor in disappointing box office for movies (like Tomb Raider, A Wrinkle in Time, Red Sparrow, and Ready Player One) that might have performed better otherwise. Perhaps that’s why Warner Bros and MGM are indeed moving forward with Tomb Raider 2, effectively giving Vikander a second chance with the Lara Croft character. Ben Wheatley (Free Fire, High-Rise) will direct the sequel, which&nbsp;has been scheduled for release on March 19, 2021. It’s not yet known which specific Tomb Raider video game (if any at all) might be adapted for the film.&nbsp;(The first was loosely adapted from the 2013 video game reboot of the same title.). The 2018 Tomb Raider&nbsp;was Rotten at 52% on the Tomatometer, but hopefully Ben Wheatley can improve on that score with the sequel. As for the box office prospects for Tomb Raider 2, some writers are already speculating that its challenger in 2021 will be Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.Other Top Headlines1. ORIGINAL HALLOWEEN CHILD STAR TO RETURN FOR HALLOWEEN KILLS(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)The original 1978 slasher movie Halloween revolved around two neighboring babysitters played by Jamie Lee Curtis and Nancy Kyes watching children in houses across the street from each other. Although Brian Andrews played Tommy Doyle, the boy Curtis’ Laurie Strode was sitting, his role was replaced by Paul Rudd in 1995’s Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, and will be played by Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club) in next year’s Halloween Kills (10/16/2020). As it turns out, Tommy won’t be the only kid returning in Halloween Kills. Despite her role in the original&nbsp;film, Kyle Richards is probably best known for appearing on the hit TV series&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills (she’s also Paris and Nicky Hilton’s aunt), but she&nbsp;will return to reprise her Halloween role as Lindsey Wallace. Although no premise details have emerged yet for Halloween Kills, the casting of Hall and Richards suggests that Michael Myers might be returning to Haddonfield this time around to target the kids that he didn’t get to kill in 1978. Jamie Lee Curtis and Judy Greer are also both reprising their roles from last year’s Halloween (Certified Fresh at 78%). Halloween Kills (10/16/2020) is also being filmed back-to-back with the third movie, Halloween Ends, which is scheduled for release a year later on October 15, 2021.2. ROONEY MARA JOINING GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S NIGHTMARE ALLEY(Photo by Laurie Sparham / © Warner Bros. Pictures)Guillermo del Toro has obviously been a highly respected genre director since at least 2006’s Pan’s Labyrinth (Certified Fresh at 95%), but after The Shape of Water (Certified Fresh at 92%)&nbsp;won the Best Picture Academy Award last year, his clout is arguably now right up there with any other top director. Guillermo del Toro’s first film as director following that win will be a remake of the 1947 carnival thriller Nightmare Alley (Fresh at 100%), and it quickly attracted seven-time Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper and two-time Oscar winner Cate Blanchett as its leads (in the roles originally played by Tyrone Power and Joan Blondell). The biggest role that remained uncast until this week was Molly, who was basically the female romantic lead for Cooper’s character, but we can now report that the role has been&nbsp;filled by&nbsp;Rooney Mara. Mara is also a two-time Academy Award nominee, once for Best Supporting Actress (Carol) and once for Best Actress (the 2011 remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). Fox Searchlight is expected to schedule Nightmare Alley sometime in prime “awards season” in late 2020.3. DOCTOR WHO STAR PETER CAPALDI ENLISTED FOR THE SUICIDE SQUAD(Photo by Simon Ridgway / ©BBC)Much like the previous Suicide Squad movie in 2016, director James Gunn’s soft reboot The Suicide Squad (8/6/2021) is expected to have a fairly large ensemble cast. Following the recent casting of comedian Steve Agee as the voice of King Shark, the new Suicide Squad team membership is pretty much filled, but presumably the new lineup will be facing multiple foes, and so far, none of those villains (or heroes) have been confirmed. So, we don’t have any idea who Peter Capaldi (A.K.A. the 12th Doctor Who) might be playing. Current Saturday Night Live cast member Pete Davidson is also reportedly in the running for a small role (which is not surprising, as the show will return soon, so his time will be limited). Other new cast members in The Suicide Squad will include David Dastmalchian (Polka-Dot Man), Daniel Melchior (Ratcatcher), and Idris Elba, Nathan Fillian, and Taika Waititi in unknown roles. Pete Davidson also has an untitled comedy based on his life story scheduled next summer for June 19, 2020.4.&nbsp;JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE SENTENCED TO STAR IN EX-CON DRAMA PALMER(Photo by Atsushi Nishijima /© Amazon)Like many (many) pop singers before and after him, Justin Timberlake has&nbsp;branched out&nbsp;since 2000 to include roles in movies&nbsp;ranging from&nbsp;animated films (Shrek the Third, Trolls), comedies (The Love Guru, Friends with Benefits), and Academy Award-nominated dramas (The Social Network, Inside Llewyn Davis). After taking a brief break&nbsp;following 2017’s Wonder Wheel, Timberlake is ready to star in another film, which will be Palmer, in which he will play a recently released ex-con trying to get his life back on track. Palmer will be directed by actor-turned-director Fisher Stevens, who won an Academy Award in 2010 for the documentary The Cove.5. EMILY BLUNT, JON HAMM, AND CHRISTOPHER WALKEN SPICE THINGS UP WITH WILD MOUNTAIN THYME(Photo by Cindy Ord, Amy Sussman, Robert Marquardt/Getty Images)Outside Mullingar was a play set in Ireland and featuring a cast that included Debra Messing (TV’s&nbsp;Will &amp; Grace) that debuted on Broadway in 2014, and now it’s being adapted as an independent movie called Wild Mountain Thyme. Northern Irish actor Jamie Dornan (Fifty Shades of Grey) has been attached to star in Wild Mountain Thyme for a while now, and this week, we learned who his co-stars will be. They include&nbsp;Emily Blunt (Mary Poppins Returns), Jon Hamm (TV’s Mad Men), and Christopher Walken. Blunt and Dornan will play “obstinate star-crossed lovers, whose families are caught up in a feud over a hotly contested patch of land that separates their two farms.” (Blunt is reportedly replacing English actress Holliday Grainger, but no reason was given for the movie.). Production is scheduled to start in Ireland on September 30th, and Wild Mountain Thyme also recently acquired distribution rights in the USA.6.&nbsp;BILLY CRYSTAL AND TIFFANY HADDISH TO CO-STAR&nbsp;HERE TODAY(Photo by Ben Gabbe, Rich Fury/Getty Images)It was only a little over two years ago that Tiffany Haddish had her big breakout role in Girls Trip, and she’s certainly stayed very busy since, with five movies released in 2018, another five in 2019, and a few different TV series roles as well. Tiffany Haddish is also now attached to star alongside Billy Crystal in an independent comedy called Here Today, which Crystal will also direct. Based on a short story called “The Prize” by screenwriter Alan Zweibel, Here Today will tell the story of “a veteran comedy writer (Crystal) who is slowly but surely losing his grip on reality and befriends a talented young New York street singer (Haddish).” Billy Crystal’s previous directorial credits include Mr. Saturday Night, Forget Paris, and the HBO baseball period drama 61*.7. AMANDA SEYFRIED TO STAR IN DREAM WORLD OF A MOUTHFUL OF AIR(Photo by Kimberly French/©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)For obvious reasons,&nbsp;it’s not always easy to&nbsp;get a firm grasp of what a movie will look like when all we have to go on is the description in a trade article, but sometimes, it’s fun to imagine. This week, in a story that seemed to go relatively unreported, we learned of an independent drama called A Mouthful of Air, in which Amanda Seyfried will star, supported by a cast that includes Paul Giamatti, Finn Wittrock (TV’s American Horror Story), Amy Irving (Yentl), and Jennifer Carpenter (TV’s Dexter). Seyfried will play “a new mom and children’s book author, who escapes into the bright Crayola colored world of her creation in order to leave behind the darkness caused by her post partum depression.” It’s not yet known to&nbsp;what degree that “Crayola colored world” will be depicted, but&nbsp;the description sort of reminds this writer of the TV show Pushing Daisies&nbsp;or the Robin Williams movie&nbsp;What Dreams May Come.8. WILL SMITH TO FOLLOW UP BRIGHT WITH COMPLETELY UNRELATED BRILLIANCE(Photo by Scott Garfield/©Netflix)Earlier this year, Disney finalized their plans to acquire the Fox film and TV properties, which excited many X-Men fans eager to see characters like Wolverine join the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The bad news, however, is that X-Men wasn’t included in Marvel’s recent Phase 4 announcements for 2020 and 2021. Marvel doesn’t have any sort of trademark on the idea of a minority of young people being born with spectacular abilities, so a novel like Marcus Sakey’s Brilliance&nbsp;is free to explore that territory. Paramount Pictures this week acquired the film rights to&nbsp;Brilliance, with an eye towards Will Smith starring and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman adapting the screenplay. Goldsman previously wrote superhero movies like Batman &amp; Robin (Rotten at 11%) and worked on comic book movies like Jonah Hex (Rotten at 12%) and The Losers (Rotten at 48%). Goldsman and Smith’s previous collaborations together have included Hancock (Rotten at 41%), I Am Legend (Fresh at 68%), and I, Robot (Rotten at 56%).9. SALARY DISPARITY DISPUTE ERUPTS OVER THE CRAZY RICH ASIANS SEQUELS(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Not unlike Marvel’s Black Panther, last year’s comedy hit Crazy Rich Asians was celebrated for the positive message it sent about the possibilities of representation for all types of people both in front of and behind the camera, and the types of stories that are told. That’s why this week’s news about the two planned Crazy Rich Asians sequels (based on the books China Rich Girlfriend and Rich People Problems)&nbsp;are particularly troubling. Screenwriter Adele Lim, who co-wrote Crazy Rich Asians with Peter Chiarelli, reportedly left the two sequel projects this week over salary disparity issues. Reportedly, Chiarelli was offered $800,000 and $1 million for the sequels, whereas Lim was only offered a sum in the $110,000 range, representing something like a mere 11% to 13% of what Chiarelli was to be paid. The explanation reportedly given is that Chiarelli’s salary offers were based upon his previous experience, as he has more credits than Lim currently does. This piece also delves into other questions that this Crazy Rich Asians controversy raises.Like this?

For a while, there was word that might be Dave Bautista as Peacemaker, until recent news that the role will likely go to fellow professional wrestler John Cena instead. Today, we learned that James Gunn still might reunite with one of his Guardians stars, with Michael Rooker now in talks to play the monstrous villain, King Shark. If you’re a fan of TV’s The Flash, you might recall that King Shark has had some pretty cool scenes on that show. The Suicide Squad cast will also include Idris Elba, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Warner Bros. has scheduled The Suicide Squad for August 6, 2021. Gunn is expected to return to Marvel Studios for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 after he wraps on the DC flick, suggesting a Guardians release date no sooner than 2022.Fresh Developments1. GAME OF THRONES,&nbsp;Bodyguard&nbsp;FAVORITE JOINS MARVEL’S THE ETERNALS(Photo by Tony Gonzalez/Everett Collection)We’re now within 10 days of the end of HBO’s Game of Thrones, so we’re in the midst of a wave of new roles for those many actors. The biggest story for a Game of Thrones favorite this week however was for someone whose last episode was nearly six years ago. Richard Madden, who played Robb Stark, the onetime King in the North, is now in talks with Marvel Studios about starring in The Eternals. If he signs on, Madden would be playing Ikaris, who, in the comics, has been a leader of the Eternals in the past. Angelina Jolie is also starring in The Eternals as Sersi (a long-running member of the Avengers in the late 1980s and early 1990s). Kumail Nanjiani (The Big Sick, HBO’s Silicon Valley) and South Korea’s Ma Dong-Seok are also attached to play unknown characters. There have also been reports that Marvel is looking to cast an openly gay Asian actor, but that role appears to have not yet been cast. The Eternals will be directed by Chloe Zhao (The Rider, Songs My Brothers Taught Me), whose two films to date both have Tomatometer scores above 90%. There is no official release date for The Eternals yet, but if the filming start dates align with the Marvel’s put out, it might be November 6, 2020 (after Black Widow, which might come out May 1, 2020).2. DISNEY SCHEDULES NEW STAR WARS MOVIES FOR 2022, 2024, AND 2026(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Every once in a while, a massive story will come out which is actually several all rolled into one. This week, Disney announced dozens of release dates (or changes), including some pretty seismic revelations. Last September, we heard that Disney planned on slowing down the release of their Star Wars franchise, and we now officially know that there will be a three year gap after this December’s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Then, starting with December 16, 2022, there will be Star Wars movies every two years; the next two will arrive in theaters on December 20, 2024 and December 18, 2026. What we don’t know is what these Star Wars movies actually are. It’s known that Rian Johnson (Star Wars: The Last Jedi) has plans for a new Star Wars trilogy. Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss are also developing a trilogy which is rumored to be set in the Old Republic period most seen to date in various video games. (You can check out a breakdown of five places we think the Star Wars franchise can go in the 2020s here.) We think that some of the release date changes are “Rotten Ideas,” so please continue to that section to read more.3. BLACK PANTHER’s CHADWICK BOSEMAN TO SLASH AGAIN AS SAMURAI YASUKE(Photo by JA/Everett Collection)Chadwick Boseman has starred in a few movies now where he was a “first.” Boseman played baseball groundbreaker Jackie Robinson in 42, he played Thurgood Marshall (the first African American Supreme Court Justice) in Marshall, and of course, Black Panther was a significant first. This week, Boseman signed on for another first in the historical drama Yasuke, in which he will portray the first African samurai in Japan. The historical Yasuke was a Portuguese retainer of Mozambique heritage who was brought to Japan as a slave in the 16th century, making him “the first black man to set foot on Japanese soil, [as] Yasuke’s arrival aroused the interest of Nobunaga, a ruthless warlord seeking to unite the fractured country under his banner.” It’s not yet known who will be directing Yasuke.4.&nbsp;Jane Campion is Back, with Doctor Strange and a Handmaid in Tow(Photo by ©Apparition/courtesy Everett Collection)Marvel Studios has tapped so many top stars (and helped others become stars) that a bunch of new films feature those names. Acclaimed New Zealand director Jane Campion (The Piano) hasn’t directed a feature film in 10 years (2009’s Bright Star), and she is now preparing to direct The Power of the Dog, an adaptation of the 1967 novel by Thomas Savage. For this film, Campion has cast Benedict Cumberbatch (Marvel’s Doctor Strange) and Elisabeth Moss of the acclaimed Hulu series The Handmaid’s Tale. Like 1994’s Legends of the Fall, The Power of the Dog is a story of ranchers in Montana, with Cumberbatch playing a wealthy Montana rancher who engages in a relentless war against his brother’s son from a secret marriage to a local widow (played by Moss). The brother and son characters have yet to be cast.5. IT: CHAPTER TWO STAR JESSICA CHASTAIN TO PUT ON THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE(Photo by Kerry Hayes/ © EuropaCorp USA /Courtesy Everett Collection)Nearly 20 years before acclaimed celebrity documentaries like Won’t You Be My Neighbor? and RBG, one of the most successful early documentaries in that style was 2001’s The Eyes of Tammy Faye, about televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker. Fox Searchlight is preparing to produce a dramatic biopic about Tammy and husband Jim, to also be titled The Eyes of Tammy Faye. Attached so far are Jessica Chastain (IT: Chapter Two, Dark Phoenix) and Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man). Director Michael Showalter (The Big Sick) will be working from a screenplay adapted from the documentary.&nbsp; There’s no word yet about which makeup artist will be hired to work on The Eyes of Tammy Faye, but whomever it is might automatically be in the running for a Hair and Makeup Oscar.6.&nbsp;CHRIS HEMSWORTH AND TIFFANY HADDISH TEAMING UP FOR BUDDY COP COMEDY(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Universal)Chris Hemsworth is proving himself a master at comedic chemistry –&nbsp;witness the splendor of &nbsp;Lebowski Thor –&nbsp;and a great foil to a strong female co-star (he will be back on screen with Ragnarok co-star Tessa Thompson in Men in Black: International this summer). The latest female star to sign on to test Hemsworth’s on-screen charisma and comedic chops is Tiffany Haddish, whose career has been blowing up ever since 2017’s Girls Trip. Haddish and Hemsworth will costar together in the “buddy cop comedy” Down Under Cover, with Haddish playing a cop who teams up with an undercover male stripper police detective.#7.&nbsp;Dark Knight&nbsp;Writer David S. Goyer Rebooting&nbsp;HellraiserJoel MearesBack in the early 2000s, Spyglass Entertainment was a prolific production company which provided Disney’s Touchstone with many&nbsp;of its hits, including&nbsp;The Count of Monte Cristo,&nbsp;Shanghai Noon, and 1999’s&nbsp;The Sixth Sense. Spyglass is back in business again as an independent company called the Spyglass Media Group and in the market for new franchises.&nbsp;Their first major project was announced this week: a reboot of the prolific horror series&nbsp;Hellraiser, featuring the erotic horrors of Pinhead and his Cenobite collaborators. When&nbsp;Hellraiser&nbsp;came out over 30 years ago in 1987, there was nothing like it, but since then, movies like&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hostel&nbsp;have made the “torture porn” horror subgenre almost ubiquitous.&nbsp;Hellraiser&nbsp;is poised to make a big return, and the job of adapting&nbsp;Hellraiser&nbsp;for a new generation is going to&nbsp;David S. Goyer, the screenwriter behind comic book adaptations like&nbsp;Blade,&nbsp;The Dark Knight, and&nbsp;Man of Steel, and this year’s&nbsp;Terminator: Dark Fate. It’s not yet known exactly how Goyer will reboot&nbsp;Hellraiser.Rotten Ideas2. DISNEY’S MASSIVE RELEASE DATE DUMP REVEALS VAST CHANGES(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Pretty much every week, there are new release dates or changes for upcoming movies, but usually it’s only for a handful of films. This week, Disney announced such a massive slate of new dates and changes that it’s had sort of a tsunami-like impact on the calendar. Disney recently finalized&nbsp;its&nbsp;acquisition of Fox’s film properties, and part of its ongoing plan is to slow Fox releases down to 5-6 films a year (cut in half from 12 in 2018). Many Fox films are therefore being delayed or outright canceled. For example, The New Mutants (the last Fox/Marvel movie before Marvel Studios takes over the X-Men and Fantastic Four) was originally scheduled for 2018, and now it’s not scheduled to come out until April 3, 2020. Harrison Ford’s Call of the Wild (February 21, 2020) is one of the other films pushed back into 2020, as is the long-in-development YA novel adaptation Artemis Fowl (May 29, 2020), though that has always been a Disney movie. Dora and the Lost City of Gold has already swept in to take over Fowl’s original August 9, 2019, release date. Disney’s slate is also significant for what it doesn’t have, such as Fox’s various Marvel movies, like Gambit (with Channing Tatum attached), and projects like X-Force, X-23, Kitty Pryde, and James Franco’s Madrox the Multiple Man.1. AVATAR 2 PUSHED BACK TO 2021 (SEVEN YEARS AFTER ITS ORIGINAL 2014 RELEASE DATE)(Photo by @ 20th Century Fox)Up until this week, it was believed that Avatar 2 would be released next year, on December 18, 2020, following years of delays from its original release date in December 2014. This week, as Disney also revealed an every-two-years rotation of Star Wars movies in 2022, 2024, and 2026, they did the same thing for the upcoming Avatar sequels. The four Avatar sequels (yes, James Cameron is really working on four sequels) are now scheduled for December releases in the odd years:&nbsp;Avatar 2 (December 17, 2021), Avatar 3 (December 22, 2023), Avatar 4 (December 19, 2025), and Avatar 5 (December 17, 2027). Paramount Pictures took quick advantage of the vacuum left by the Avatar 2 move, pushing their own sequel, Coming to America 2, back to December 18, 2020. By doing that, Paramount also made room for the science-fiction drama Infinite, starring Chris Evans, on August 7, 2020. For their own part, Disney also replaced Avatar 2 with their own films, the double feature of Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story remake on December 18, 2020, followed by Cruella (the live-action 101 Dalmatians starring Emma Stone), five days later on December 23, 2020. We can expect the next few weeks to have more release date changes from Disney’s competitor studios.Like this?

Jackson, Dave Bautista, and more.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 21, 2019 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you another eight headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering&nbsp;up-and-coming titles like Black Widow, Paranormal Activity 7, and the Hunger Games prequel.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJAMIE LEE CURTIS TO RETURN FOR HALLOWEEN 2 IN 2020(Photo by Ryan Green/Universal Pictures)Although John Carpenter’s original 1978 slasher film, Halloween&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 95%) is considered a horror classic, the franchise then received a steady stream of Rotten Tomatometer scores until the soft reboot last year starring Jamie Lee Curtis came back Certified Fresh at 79%. That film was also a box office smash with a $76 million opening weekend&nbsp;that led to the film earning $255 million globally from a production budget of just $10 million. Like most studios right now, Universal Pictures is looking for any toehold they can find in an effort to stay relevant up against Walt Disney Pictures, so it’s super unsurprising to report that Paramount is moving forward with plans for (another) Halloween 2. Jamie Lee Curtis is expected to return for Halloween 2, as are Judy Greer and Andi Matichak as her daughter and granddaughter. Universal Pictures has an “untitled” horror film scheduled for October 16, 2020, which most sources are interpreting as being Halloween 2. (That release date has also been claimed for Robert Zemeckis’ remake of The Witches, and for the G.I. Joe spinoff Snake Eyes.)Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;PIXAR&nbsp;REVEALS AMBITIOUS SOUL FOR 2020(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Since releasing Inside Out (Certified Fresh at 98%) in 2015, Pixar has released one or two films a year for a total of seven films in five calendar years. Of the last five films, all were sequels except Coco (Certified Fresh at 97%). After releasing just one film a year in 2017 (The Incredibles 2) and 2018 (Toy Story 4), Pixar is going to return to releasing two films in 2020, and they’re both going to be non-sequels. Pixar released the first trailer&nbsp;for the fantasy comedy Onward (3/6/2020), and this week, they revealed the title and theme of their second 2020 film. The reveal still leaves a lot unsaid (like cast and premise), but Soul teases a story written and directed by Pete Docter (Up, Inside Out) that asks, “Ever wonder where your passion, your dreams and your interests come from? What is it that makes you… YOU?” Disney and Pixar will release Soul on June 19, 2020, up against an untitled Pete Davidson comedy, and the week before Top Gun: Maverick and Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical In the Heights.2. THE HUNGER GAMES TO RECEIVE PREQUEL MOVIE SET 64 YEARS EARLIER(Photo by Murray Close/Lionsgate)This week’s news about The Hunger Games sort of deserves some mathematical assistance.&nbsp;You may not remember how many Hunger Games had taken place prior to the first film’s narrative,&nbsp;but it’s much easier to recall that The Hunger Games: Catching Fire depicted the 75th competition, and that’s made easier by remembering that every 25th iteration of the Hunger Games (called “Quarter Quells”) follow special rules. It was announced this week that author Suzanne Collins will publish an “untitled Panem novel” on May 19, 2020 that will be set 64 years before the events of The Hunger Games (in other words, 10 years after the games started, in world). Lionsgate was likewise quick to move forward with plans for a prequel&nbsp;based on that forthcoming novel. Online sources also quickly produced articles about the&nbsp;film, such as this one asking if The Hunger Games is still revelant in 2020, and this one listing other possible prequel ideas.3. THIS WEEK IN MARVEL: KEANU REEVES, AVENGERS: ENDGAME RERELEASE, AND BLACK WIDOW(Photo by Netflix)Some weeks, Marvel Studios could swallow half of The Weekly Ketchup if we let them, so it helps to just bunch their stories together. Let’s start with the story that you’ve probably already seen crawl across your social media, which is that Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige remarked that they frequently talk to Keanu Reeves about joining almost every new project, and they’re still looking for a role for him. This begs a few questions, like what past roles might have gone to Reeves (Ant-Man? Doctor Strange? Thanos?), and whether Feige might be getting ahead of an upcoming announcement for a film like The Eternals or Shang-Chi (Keanu Reeves is partially of Chinese descent). In other Marvel news, Feige also revealed that Avengers: Endgame will return to theaters next week (6/28/2019) with new scenes as part of an effort to pass current box office record holder Avatar. As for Marvel’s plans for 2020, British actor Ray Winstone (Noah, Sexy Beast) joined the cast of the Black Widow prequel this week in an unspecified role.4. LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA TO EXPLODE ON NETFLIX WITH TICK, TICK…BOOM!(Photo by Lev Radin/Everett Collection)We may still have to wait for a while yet for the inevitable Hamilton movie, but 2020 is still going to be a big year for&nbsp;its&nbsp;creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda. The long-in-development adaptation of his musical In the Heights will be released on June 26, 2020, and Sony Pictures Animation also has Vivo, featuring eleven new songs by Miranda, scheduled for release on November 6, 2020. A third project (which doesn’t have a release date yet) is called Tick, Tick… Boom!, and this week it was picked up by Netflix. Lin-Manuel Miranda will make his feature film directorial debut with Tick, Tick… Boom!, which will be an adaptation of a stage musical by the late creator of&nbsp;Rent, Jonathan Larson. Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man) is reportedly the choice to star in the musical as an “aspiring theater composer” and waiter living in New York City in 1990.5. DISCO ERA BIOPIC SPINNING GOLD ATTRACTS SAMUEL L. JACKSON AND OTHERS(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Studios)Some movies manage to get developed, produced, and released in just a few years, but there are others that date back decades. One such example is Spinning Gold, the biopic of 1970s record company executive Neil Bogart, whose Casablanca Records was the home of acts like the Village People, Donna Summer, Parliament, the Isley Brothers, and KISS. Following the box office successes of Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman, Spinning Gold is finally going to start filming on July 16, and this week, the film’s large ensemble cast was announced. Parliament will be represented by Samuel L. Jackson (as George Clinton) and D.L. Hughley (as Bootsy Collins), Jason Derulo will portray Ron Isley, Neil Patrick Harris will play KISS manager Bill Aucoin, and Kenan Thompson will portray Motown’s Berry Gordy. Neil Bogart himself will be played by relative-unknown Jeremy Jordan, who’s best known for stage musicals like Newsies, Bonnie &amp; Clyde, and Waitress.6. VIOLA DAVIS AND CHADWICK BOSEMAN TO LEAD MA RAINEY’S BLACK BOTTOM FOR NETFLIX(Photo by Dee Cercone, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Starting with Jitney in 1982, playwright August Wilson wrote a series of ten films set in Pittsburgh during each of the 20th Century’s decades, including the 1950s-set Fences. Denzel Washington directed and starred in the film adaptation (Certified Fresh at 92%), which received four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and a win for Viola Davis for Best Supporting Actress. Now, Davis has signed on with Netflix to star as the famous titular blues singer&nbsp;in their adaptation of the 1920s entry in Wilson’s Pittsburgh Cycle, the jazz era drama Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, and she’ll be joined by Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman. Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom will be produced for Netflix by Denzel Washington, who has stated a commitment to eventually getting all ten plays in August Wilson’s Pittsburgh Cycle adapted as feature films.7. CLASSIC GHOST STORY BLITHE SPIRIT GETTING REMADE(Photo by Greg Doherty/Getty Images)Although British director David Lean eventually became famous for epics like Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, and The Bridge on the River Kwai, earlier in his career, he produced more intimate films like Brief Encounter and 1945’s Blithe Spirit. The latter was a comedy about a ghost based on a play by British actor and playwright Noël Coward, a new version of which started production this week in England. Dan Stevens (of TV’s Downton Abbey and Legion) will star as a struggling writer who becomes haunted by the ghost of his first wife (Leslie Mann). Isla Fisher will play his second (still living) wife, and Dame Judi Dench will play the medium whose seance accidentally summons the ghost.8. DAVE BAUSTISTA AND ICE CUBE LIKELY TO PLAY THE KILLER’S GAME(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube has starred or co-starred in a few different successful franchises, including Friday, Ride Along, Barbershop, and 21 Jump Street, but future sequels either aren’t planned (21 Jump Street, Barbershop) or are delayed (Friday, Ride Along).&nbsp;For 2020 and 2021, Ice Cube is instead looking at two new projects. The first is a comedy called Covers set in the music industry, with Dakota Johnson and black-ish star Tracee Ellis Ross already attached to star. Ice Cube is also in negotiations to star in an adaptation of the hitman novel The Killer’s Game, along with Dave Bautista, who has two different action movies out this summer (Stuber and My Spy).Rotten Idea1. SECURITY CAMERAS TO BE HAUNTED AGAIN IN PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 7(Photo by Paramount Pictures)It’s now been four years since 2015’s Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension earned the franchise’s lowest box office to date. The Paranormal Activity movies were relatively affordable to produce, though, so it was probably inevitable that Paramount Pictures would want to start making them again. Producer Jason Blum (of Blumhouse Productions) is now developing Paranormal Activity 7 for Paramount, although the premise isn’t yet known (though it seems obvious that it will probably be another “found footage” horror film). We’re calling Paranormal Activity 7 this week’s Rotten Idea based on the Rotten Tomatometer scores for the last three films (24%, 39%, and 15%, respectively).Like this?

Sequel Is in the Works, Plus More Movie NewsStar Wars Episode IX reveals a title and trailer, Marvel makes a whole lot of plans, Tomb Raider gets a sequel, and Grease gets a prequel.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 12, 2019 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;titles like The Eternals, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and Tomb Raider 2.This WEEK’S TOP STORYSHAZAM! SEQUEL ALREADY IN THE WORKS(Photo by Warner Bros.)The DC Comics movie Shazam! has only been in theaters for a week, and a sequel is already in development. Shazam! opened much lower ($53 million domestically) than similar movies like Aquaman&nbsp;($67.8 million) and&nbsp;Captain Marvel ($153 million), but its $100 million budget was also (presumably) lower than those films. Screenwriter Henry Gayden, who wrote Shazam!, will also return to write its sequel. We don’t know the premise of the sequel yet, but the mid-credits tease gave us a clue about the possible villain. One has to guess that the Shazam! sequel will probably also tie in to the long-planned Black Adam movie, and this week, that film’s star revealed via an Instagram video that Black Adam will likely start filming sometime in 2020.Fresh Developments1. STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER TRAILER REVELATIONSAfter months of waiting, we finally learned the title of Star Wars Episode IX via the first teaser trailer, which revealed that the ninth episode’s title will be Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. That last word is a curious choice, given what we seemed to learn at the end of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, but it’s possible that “Skywalker” in the context of the final installment of the nine-film saga could mean something other than a family name. In the teaser trailer, we see the return of two familiar faces: Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian and the late Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa. Although the teaser trailer appeared on various sources instantaneously, the official location of the reveal was at a panel at this weekend’s Star Wars Celebration in Chicago, which you can watch here.&nbsp; We also hear the voice of Mark Hamill narrating as Luke Skywalker, and at the end of the teaser, what appears to be this actor’s sinister laugh.&nbsp; Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is scheduled for December 20, 2019. You can read our full trailer breakdown here.2. THIS WEEK IN MARVEL PART 1: THE ETERNALS, BLACK WIDOW, SHANG-CHI(Photo by Marvel Studios)As often happens nowadays, there were several stories this week related to Marvel movies, but in the interest of saving time, we’re going to bundle together into just two Weekly Ketchup entries. Let’s start with next year’s The Eternals, for which Kumail Nanjiani (The Big Sick, HBO’s Silicon Valley) is now in talks for a role. We don’t have any idea what character Nanjiani might play, except that he’s the second name attached to The Eternals, after Angelina Jolie from a few weeks back. The other movie that Marvel Studios is filming this year is Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow solo movie, and O-T Fagbenle (The Handmaid’s Tale) is now in talks for an unknown role. Fagbenle is the fourth new actor in talks for Black Widow after Florence Pugh, David Harbour (Hellboy), and Rachel Weisz (The Favourite). There was also news this week of a deal between Marvel Studios and the government of Australia for a subsidy for the filming of an upcoming movie, which people are speculating will be Shang-Chi (AKA Master of Kung-Fu).3. THIS WEEK IN MARVEL PART 2: FIVE YEAR PLAN POST-AVENGERS: ENDGAME&nbsp;(Photo by Marvel Studios)We know that Black Widow and The Eternals are the next two films Marvel Studios is shooting, and that they are also developing films&nbsp;for Shang-Chi and Ms. Marvel, as well as the sequels&nbsp;Black Panther 2, Doctor Strange 2, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 (plus, presumably, Captain Marvel will probably get a sequel too). That, however, is only eight films, and this week we learned that Kevin Feige is saying that they have a five-year plan, which, given Marvel’s recent three-movies-a-year schedule, means they’re going to come up a bit short.&nbsp;It’s possible&nbsp;that Marvel Studios is including their recent acquisition of Deadpool, Fantastic Four, and X-Men from Fox, but Feige seems to be saying that the five-year plan comes first. We also probably won’t get official announcements of this plan until after this summer’s Spider-Man: Far from Home. In the meantime, we also learned this week of Jeremy Renner starring in a Hawkeye series for the Disney+ app, plus confirmation of the Disney+ shows WandaVision, Loki, Falcon and Winter Soldier, and the animated What If? You can read about all of the Disney+ updates in our roundup here.4. OSCAR-WINNING BLACK PANTHER COSTUMER TAPPED FOR&nbsp;COMING TO AMERICA 2(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Marvel’s Black Panther won three Academy Awards this year for Best Original Score, Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design. That last Oscar went to Ruth E. Carter, whose film work has also included Amistad, Selma, and several of&nbsp; Spike Lee’s joints, including Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X. On Black Panther, Carter adapted the comic book costumes of the royalty of Wakanda, the citizens of Wakanda, and the related tribal leaders, and now she’s going to give us the attire of another fictional African nation. Ruth E. Carter will be the costume designer of the long-awaited sequel to Eddie Murphy’s Coming to America, which is scheduled for August 7, 2020, the week after Sony/Marvel’s vampire movie Morbius, starring Jared Leto.5. CAMILA CABELLO TO STAR IN JAMES CORDEN’S TAKE ON CINDERELLA(Photo by Steve Mack/Everett Collection)It was just four years ago that Disney released their live action remake of their classic animated film Cinderella. This week we learned that Sony Pictures is now developing their own take on&nbsp;the tale that&nbsp;is based on a story idea from late night host James Corden. The star of Sony’s Cinderella will be singer-songwriter Camila Cabello, who will also be involved with the film’s music (and the movie will be more of a musical than Disney’s 2015 version). Sony’s Cinderella musical will be written and directed by Kay Cannon, who made her feature film debut last year with Blockers (Certified Fresh at 84%).6. DAVE BAUTISTA JOINS ZACK SNYDER’S ZOMBIE MOVIE ARMY OF THE DEAD(Photo by JA/Everett Collection)Dwayne Johnson is still the busiest wrester-turned-actor right now, but Guardians of the Galaxy star Dave Bautista is getting close. In addition to his likely appearance in Avengers: Endgame, Bautista will also star in Stuber (7/12/2019), My Spy (TBA 2019),&nbsp;Escape Plan: The Extractors (TBA 2019/2020), and as Glossu Rabban in the Dune remake (11/20/2020). In addition to those five films, Bautista signed on to two more this week. The first one we heard about this week was Army of the Dead, the “zombie heist” movie that Zack Snyder will be directing for Netflix. Although Snyder did earn a Certified Fresh 75% for his previous zombie movie, Dawn of the Dead, his last four movies have all received Rotten Tomatometer scores. Meanwhile, Bautista is also attached to star in an action/thriller called Killer’s Game for STXfilms and D.J. Caruso, who is likewise coming off a five-film Rotten Tomatometer streak.Rotten Ideas3. KEN JEONG TO VOICE DYNOMUTT IN SCOOB(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)A few weeks ago, we learned that the beloved animated character Captain Caveman will be making his feature film debut next year in Scoob (5/15/2020). Tracy Morgan will be voicing Captain Caveman, and the main Mystery Inc. gang will be voiced by Zac Efron (Fred), Amanda Seyfried (Daphne), Gina Rodriguez (Velma), Will Forte (Shaggy), and Frank Welker (Scooby). This week, we learned that Captain Caveman won’t be the only classic 1970s character making his debut in Scoob, as Ken Jeong (The Hangover, Crazy Rich Asians) will be voicing Dynomutt, the co-star of The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour from 1976 to 1977. Kiersey Clemons (Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising) has also joined the voice cast as Dee Dee Skyes, one of Captain Caveman’s “Teen Angels,” who were basically a Saturday morning cartoon spoof of the popular Charlie’s Angels primetime series.2. TOMB RAIDER GETTING A SEQUEL AFTER ALL(Photo by Warner Bros.)When the Tomb Raider reboot opened in second place last year under the box office juggernaut that was Black Panther, many pundits probably presumed that the would-be franchise for Tomb Raider would be a non-starter. And critically, like most video game adaptations, the Alicia Vikander version of Tomb Raider also received a Rotten Tomatometer score of 52%. As it turns out, neither of those details is holding back Lara Croft’s cinematic future, as MGM is now developing a sequel. Possibly hoping to increase the chances of a Fresh score, MGM has hired screenwriter Amy Jump, whose Tomatometer is mostly Certified Fresh, with her one Rotten score for High-Rise being just one point off at 59%. But considering the history of video game adaptations and the lackluster first film, the&nbsp;Tomb Raider sequel will have a pretty steep hill to climb.1. TELL ME MORE, TELL ME MORE, SUMMER LOVING SOUNDS LIKE A DRAG(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)By 1978 standards, Grease was a fun, nostalgic musical and a favorite for two different generations. By other standards, the lyrics of some of the songs (like, say, “Greased Lightning”) have not aged well at all. One such example is “Summer Nights,” the lyrics of which include what seem like references to attempted sexual assault (or at least a “tell me more” inquiry about one). So, obviously, a major movie studio would never consider developing a&nbsp;Grease prequel in 2019 called Summer Loving, right? Of course they would, and they are. Frequent Tim Burton collaborator John August has been hired by Paramount Pictures to work on the prequel, which will show how greaser Danny Zuko first met Australian exchange student Sandy Olsson on the beach during summer vacation. John August’s next film will be next month’s Aladdin (5/24/2019), and he also worked on Guillermo del Toro’s Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (8/9/2019).Like this?

That doesn’t mean, however, that he can’t start building other franchises for his filmography. Perhaps surprisingly for his age (23), that next big role for Tom Holland is Nathan Drake, the star of Sony’s Uncharted video game franchise. (It appears that, as with Alicia Vikander’s Tomb Raider reboot, the first Uncharted movie might be a prequel or origin story.) The movie has been in development for a while, but Sony Pictures has confirmed production by announcing a release date of December 18, 2020. By aiming for that weekend, Sony is directly taking on Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story remake and Eddie Murphy’s Coming to America sequel. The Uncharted video games combine elements of Tomb Raider, Indiana Jones, and arguably Nicolas Cage’s National Treasure movies. The first Uncharted movie will be directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who made his debut in 2016 with 10 Cloverfield Lane (Certified Fresh at 90%).Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;QUENTIN TARANTINO’S DJANGO TO CROSSOVER WITH ZORRO(Photo by Andrew Cooper/Weinstein Company)Much has been written in the last year or so about Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (7/26/2019) (currently Fresh at 94%)&nbsp;and his possible Star Trek plans, but another old rumor was confirmed this week with the news that Tarantino is also producing (but probably won’t direct) what’s basically a sequel to his 2012 “Southern” Django Unchained, starring Jamie Foxx as the title character. As appealing as such a sequel might be on its own, the title takes it to another level, because Django/Zorro would cross the character over with the Californian freedom fighter who is celebrating his 100th anniversary this year. Quentin Tarantino has enlisted comedian-turned-screenwriter Jerrod Carmichael, of TV’s The Carmichael Show, to adapt the Dynamite Entertainment and Vertigo Comics comic book of the same title.2.&nbsp;SIMON PEGG AND NICK FROST&nbsp;REUNITING TO PRODUCE HORROR MOVIE&nbsp;SVALTA(Photo by Rogue Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)From 2004 to 2013, British comic actors Simon Pegg (a.k.a. Scotty from Star Trek and Benji from the&nbsp;Mission:Impossible movies)&nbsp;and Nick Frost starred in director Edgar Wright’s Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World’s End), and also co-starred together in other films like Paul and The Adventures of Tintin. We should note right away that they’re not yet confirmed&nbsp;to be starring in this week’s new project, but they are producing the film together. Pegg and Frost have sold a horror pitch called Svalta to Orion Pictures, with Frost also attached as the film’s screenwriter. Svalta will tell the story of “a family on their summer vacation to a remote Swedish island [called Svalta] where they discover a serial killer is on the loose, but the locals have no interest in helping the stranded family of tourists.”3. NEW PROJECTS FOR MAHERSHALA ALI AND&nbsp;BARRY JENKINS(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Steve Mack/Everett Collection)In 2016, Mahershala Ali and director Barry Jenkins took home a trio of Oscars — including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor — for their collaborative work on the coming-of-age drama Moonlight, and both of their stars have only risen higher since. Accordingly, each of them made&nbsp;headlines with new film projects this week. Mahershala Ali is now attached to executive produce and star in a Fox Searchlight true story drama called Solitary. The film will be adapted from a memoir by Albert Woodfox, who spent 43 years in solitary confinement at Louisiana’s notorious Angola Prison. Barry Jenkins’ new film is also set up at Fox Searchlight,&nbsp;and it will be an untitled biopic about acclaimed dance choreographer Alvin Ailey.4. POP STAR CAMILA CABELLO’S CINDERELLA SCHEDULED FOR 2021(Photo by Steve Mack/Everett Collection)Sony Pictures is moving forward with plans for a new version of the fairy tale Cinderella starring Camila Cabello,&nbsp;a Cuban-American pop star&nbsp;who got her start as a contestant on&nbsp;The X-Factor&nbsp;in 2012, as the studio officially scheduled the film&nbsp;for release on February 5, 2021. That puts it one&nbsp;week after the Rugrats reboot movie (1/29/2021) and one week before Marvel Studios’ first movie in 2021 (we don’t know which movie that is yet). This new Cinderella will be directed by Blockers‘ (Certified Fresh at 83%) Kay Cannon, who this week also made the news for a project called 79ers. That movie is being produced by Will Ferrell and Seth Rogen and is described as being like “The Goonies for adults,” following a group of friends who are forced to reunite 20 years later after failing to finish a treasure hunt as teenagers.5. BILL SKARSGARD&nbsp;TO SPEND NINE DAYS WITH VARIOUS MARVEL MOVIE CO-STARS(Photo by Brooke Palmer/Warner Bros.)It’s not that uncommon that the same actor or filmmaker shows up in more than one new project in a given week, but this week we saw this happen a few times. Let’s start here with a supernatural thriller called Nine Days, in which Black Panther and Us star Winston Duke will play a mysterious man who “interviews prospective candidates, a personification of human souls… for the privilege that he once had.” (This writer doesn’t quite know what that even means, but there you go.) Those “personifications” will be played by Zazie Beetz (Domino from Deadpool 2), Benedict Wong (Wong from Doctor Strange), and Bill Skarsgård (a.k.a. Pennywise from IT). The repeat star in this case is Bill Skarsgård, who also signed on this week to star in a true crime drama called Gilded Rage.6. PETER DINKLAGE SAYS&nbsp;I CARE A LOT(Photo by HBO)Going into the final episodes of Game of Thrones, it seemed likely that the show’s various stars would be riding career highs and that the casting stories would be chock-ablock with their names. That, however, was until everyone saw those last two episodes, which seemed to put the brakes on eight seasons of fan and critical love. Having said that, the stars of the show are obviously talented, and they should be just fine. Case in point: Peter Dinklage, GoT‘s Tyrion Lannister, joined Gone Girl star Rosamund Pike in a thriller called I Care a Lot. Pike will star as a “legal guardian” (a lawyer or a foster parent, it’s unclear), but Dinklage’s character is being kept secret.7. TWO YOUNG NETFLIX STARS CAST AS THE DAUGHTERS OF BILL &amp; TED FACE THE MUSIC(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)The last time we saw Bill S. Preston (Alex Winter) and Ted Logan (Keanu Reeves) in 1991’s Bill &amp; Ted’s Bogus Journey, the rock stars of the band Wyld Stallyns seemed to be riding high, including happy relationships with their princess girlfriends plucked from medieval times. It’s still unclear what all happened to Bill and Ted in the last 25+ years, but this week, we learned that their characters both now have teenage daughters. Those roles will be played by Netflix stars Samara Weaving (The Babysitter) and Brigette Lundy-Paine (Atypical) when Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music next summer (8/21/2020).Rotten Ideas2. DWAYNE JOHNSON REUNITING WITH JUNGLE CRUISE DIRECTOR FOR BLACK ADAM(Photo by Vince Valitutti/Columbia Pictures)Disney’s Jungle Cruise, based on their long-running theme park ride, doesn’t come out until next July (7/24/2020), so most people probably don’t even know&nbsp;it’s in the works. (FYI, Disney also recruited their Mary Poppins Returns star, Emily Blunt, to take that cruise as well.) Nevertheless, Dwayne Johnson must’ve had great things to say about his Jungle Cruise director, because Jaume Collett-Serra has now been recruited by New Line Cinema to reunite with Johnson&nbsp;on Black Adam. Johnson has long been attached to star in the DC Comics adaptation, including a time&nbsp;when he would have co-starred in Shazam! as the immortal Egyptian villain-turned-antihero Black Adam. (It’s arguable that Mark Strong’s Dr. Sivana filled the role Black Adam would have.)&nbsp;Jaume Collett-Serra’s Tomatometer is mostly comprised of Rotten splotches, but he did receive Fresh scores for Non-Stop and The Shallows. Hopefully these next two collaborations with Dwayne Johnson will&nbsp;yield better results.1.&nbsp;MAGIC 8 BALL GETTING ITS OWN BLUMHOUSE HORROR FRANCHISE(Photo by Suzanne Tenner/Relativity Media courtesy Everett Collection)Blumhouse Productions, Universal Pictures, and Hasbro Films had two relative hits with Ouija and its prequel Ouija: Origin of Evil. With that in mind, Blumhouse and Universal are uniting with another toy company, Mattel, on a similar project, this time based on… Magic 8-Balls. We can all shake our Magic 8-Balls to see what it says about a Magic 8-Ball movie, but one thing that suggests “outlook not so good” is that the director Blumhouse and Universal have hired for the job&nbsp;is Jeff Wadlow. Of the six feature films on Wadlow’s, not one has received a Fresh score, with 2013’s superhero sequel&nbsp;Kick-Ass 2 earning the&nbsp;highest score at 32% on the Tomatometer. Jeff Wadlow’s next film before taking on Magic 8-Ball will be the movie adaptation of the long-running ABC supernatural drama Fantasy Island, starring Michael Peña as the new Mr. Roarke.Like this?

So when we get to this time of the year, there’s really not much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss, especially not in a weekly column which normally includes 10 different stories. So, last week, we instead reviewed 12 of the year’s top “Fresh Development” stories, and this week, we’re looking at 12+ of the year’s most Rotten Ideas. Our retrospective begins not with a single story, but a continuing theme that kept making the news (though we’re still not sure why). We’re talking about…MOST ROTTEN IDEA&nbsp;Of the yearHOLLYWOOD’S ILLOGICAL VIDEO GAME OBSESSION CONTINUESThe video game industry is now in its fifth decade (figuring a rough start sometime in the early 1970s), but the marriage between it and Hollywood has yet to take off as a collective enterprise (at least, not in the way&nbsp;comic book movies have). That hasn’t stopped&nbsp;producers from developing potential projects, of course. Some pundits thought 2016 had the&nbsp;potential to be a breakthrough year for the genre, with such high profile game adaptations as Ratchet &amp; Clank, The Angry Birds Movie, Warcraft, and Assassin’s Creed. Unfortunately,&nbsp;those films went on to earn&nbsp;Rotten Tomatometer scores of 18 percent, 43 percent, 28 percent, and 17 percent, respectively. You might say, well, that’s just one year, but the thing is, there has never been a movie based on a video game with a Fresh Tomatometer score. Video games do have a lot of potential as feature film source material, but the simplest games don’t possess a narrative&nbsp;structure. That’s why we called the year’s first major video game development story — about forthcoming adaptations of the classic Atari arcade games Missile Command and&nbsp;Centipede —&nbsp;a Rotten Idea. That wasn’t all we got in 2016, either:&nbsp;we also heard about the plans in China for a trilogy of movies based on Tetris. , which, eight years ago, was the subject of a tongue-in-cheek mock trailer. Speaking of video game movies with only the barest narrative structures, this was also the year that a&nbsp;Fruit Ninja movie entered development&nbsp;as an animated feature (probably “like” The Angry Birds Movie, which announced a sequel as well). But wait, there’s more! First, there’s the movie based on Tom Clancy’s The Division, which will feature Jake Gyllenhaal, which&nbsp;was then followed by the Gears of War movie, based upon the popular XBox/PC third-person shooter franchise.&nbsp;That’s a grand total of eight movies that entered development this year. Will Hollywood ever learn its lesson from all of those Rotten Tomatometer scores for movies based on video games?JANUARY: MICHAEL BAY’S FIFTH TRANSFORMERS MOVIE CONFIRMED FOR SUMMER, 2017One of the highest profile news threads running through most of 2015 was talk of where the mega-successful Transformers film franchise would go next, with reported&nbsp;plans for spinoffs and prequels in the future. One question lingered amid all the speculation: would Michael Bay, who has directed all the live-action Transformers movie to date, return? It turned out the answer was yes, though he would hand the franchise to someone else after the fifth installment. Filming on&nbsp;Transformers: The Last Knight is already done, and it’s scheduled for release on June 23, 2017 (the week after Cars 3 and before Despicable Me 3). We also learned this year that Paramount Pictures is now committed to making Transformers an annual franchise starting in 2017; the 6th and 7th Transformers movies will follow on June 8th, 2018 and June 28, 2019. With a number of franchises&nbsp;(Marvel, Star Wars, X-Men, WB/DC) doing the same, it appears that this will be a model that more studios will follow. The news also broke this year that the 6th movie will be the first solo spinoff movie focusing on Bumblebee, basically doing for Transformers what Rogue One did for Star Wars. The promise/threat of a Transformers movie every year was a Rotten Idea, based on the franchise’s Tomatometer scores.FEBRUARY: SAN ANDREAS SEQUEL TO SHAKE UP DWAYNE JOHNSON’S WORLD AGAINAfter earning over $473 million last year globally, the earthquake disaster movie San Andreas is set to get a sequel. New Line Cinema is now moving forward with exactly that plan, and the studio expects Dwayne Johnson to return as his pilot character again. This time around, the focus may be moving to the area called “The Ring of Fire” (is that the possible subtitle right there?), which is a band of volcanos and earthquake hotspots around the Pacific Islands. In addition to Johnson, New Line Cinema also hopes that his costars Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario, and Paul Giamatti will also return. Whatever San Andreas 2 is called or is about, the sequel will also see the return of director&nbsp;Brad Peyton, whose three films to date have all received Rotten Tomatometer scores (50 percent for San Andreas, 42 percent&nbsp;for Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, and 14 percent for Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore).MARCH: THE MONTH OF ZACK SNYDER’S 300-STYLE REINVENTIONS: GEORGE WASHINGTON, THE ALAMO, ANCIENT CHINA&nbsp;The biggest release in the month of March, 2016, was Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which ended up being the fourth Rotten movie in a row for director Zack Snyder. Snyder spent much of the month talking about possible future films, almost all of which sound sort of rotten as well. In a Bloomberg Business profile on Snyder, he talked up his interest in making a movie about Revolutionary War General George Washington, specifically the Battle of Trenton, “in the style of 300.” It’s anyone’s guess as to what exactly that would look like, and how much of it would be in slo-mo. The “in the style of 300” theme came up again this year in an interview with Collider, when Snyder stated that&nbsp;he would like to apply that same filmmaking approach to other battles throughout history. Here’s the quote, specifically: “I think I mentioned that we talked about the Revolutionary War version, and we talked about the Alamo, and we’ve talked about there’s a battle in China, a ‘Lost Legion’ kind of concept; any of those kinds of things are on the table.” History isn’t the only target for Snyder’s aspirations, however, as he also talked in March about his ideas for a new adaptation of Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead, based on Rand’s screenplay for the 1949 movie starring Gary Cooper. All of these movies are likely at least a few years away from getting made (if any of them ever do), since most of Snyder’s time will be devoted to Justice League Part One (11/17/17), the Afghanistan war drama The Last Photograph, and his second Justice League movie after that.APRIL: WILL FERRELL AND MARK WAHLBERG TO REUNITE FOR DADDY’S HOME 2When it comes to sequels, box office success is generally more of a factor than critical success. So, when Paramount Pictures saw a worldwide box office take of $240 million for the relatively inexpensive comedy Daddy’s Home, a sequel was a given. In April, it was announced that Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg both signed on with Paramount Pictures to return for Daddy’s Home 2. The premise hasn’t been revealed yet, but it’s easy to speculate that, as with similar sequels (Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, for example), the setup might be “basically the same, except the opposite.” Unless it’s not. Anyway, Daddy’s Home earned a Rotten score of just 32 percent, and most of the news that came out of April was a lot more Fresh, so Daddy’s Home 2 earns this slot.MAY:&nbsp;HOLLYWOOD TO MAKE SLENDER MAN MOVIEIf you grew up in the world before social media (and especially before the internet took off in the 1990s), the way you interpreted things as a child might be different from the way (some) modern children do. That, at least, might have been an eye-opening epiphany for those who read&nbsp;the news two years ago about&nbsp;two 12 year old girls who stabbed another girl&nbsp;trying to impress a fictional character called Slender Man, the subject of an extensive internet meme that includes short stories, “true story” testimonials, YouTube videos, and video games. It was probably inevitable that someone, somewhere would adapt the character into a horror film, and now, thanks to Screen Gems and Mythology Entertainment, we’re getting that film. That production company is also currently developing The Overlook Hotel, a prequel to Stephen King’s The Shining.JUNE: BEVERLY HILLS COP 4 BACK IN DEVELOPMENT, BUT IS THAT A GOOD THING?Some movie projects — frequently sequels or reboots — seem to hover just on the edge of film development for years, or even decades. One example, which this writer remembers following back in the 1990s, is the notion of a Beverly Hills Cop 4, which would presumably resurrect the Eddie Murphy “cop comedy” franchise after the Rotten sequels Beverly Hills Cop II (46 percent) in 1987 and Beverly Hills Cop III (10 percent) in 1994. The last major news about Beverly Hills Cop 4 came last year when a March 25th, 2016 release date was pulled by Paramount Pictures. At that time, there had also been a Beverly Hills Cop TV series that CBS was developing but then dropped in 2013. Desperate for another successful franchise, Paramount continued to push for the development of Beverly Hills Cop 4, and&nbsp;in June, the sequel made the news by announcing that Belgian directors Ardil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah were attached to direct for producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Their first film,&nbsp;Black, won festival awards in 2015, and though it’s currently Fresh at 60 percent, it’s only got five reviews, which is hardly comprehensive, and we can’t help but notice some of the strong language in the Rotten reviews. Ouch. Plus, Eddie Murphy hasn’t had a particularly stellar track record lately either. Can these indie directors turn the Beverly Hills Cop&nbsp;franchise around?JULY: SOME FRANCHISES DON’T KNOW WHEN TO DIE:&nbsp; SAW #8 COMING IN 2017People like familiar franchises that provide sequels with familiar expectations; we get that. But some of them&nbsp;never seem to be able to transcend their niche audiences and be embraced, at least on some level, by the critics that form the very core of what we talk about here. One example&nbsp;is the&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;franchise, which critically peaked at 48 percent with the first movie (which is still Rotten), and failed even to crack 10 percent with its most recent installment, Saw: The Final Chapter. It’s been five years since that film was released, and Lionsgate has been looking for another big franchise ever since The Hunger Games ended.&nbsp; With that in mind, the studio&nbsp;is preparing to produce an 8th Saw movie, which they have scheduled for release next year, on October 27, 2017 (just before Halloween, of course). For this installment, Lionsgate has hired the creative writer/director team of the Spierig Brothers (Peter and Michael). The Spierig Brothers bring a certain level of fan anticipation to the Saw franchise, with their two most recent films (Daybreakers and Predestination) both receiving Fresh Tomatometer scores, so it’s sort of a tricky thing. On one hand, we have directors who have given us two pretty great genre films, but on the other, it’s still the Saw franchise we’re talking about here.AUGUST: JASON MOMOA TO STAR IN REBOOT OF THE CROWThe idea of a reboot of the comic book superhero franchise The Crow has been kicking around for several years, including periods during which the possible new star might have been Jack Huston (Boardwalk Empire), Luke Evans (Dracula Untold), or even possibly Mark Wahlberg or Bradley Cooper. It’s been a while now since the last&nbsp;update, and the production company Relativity recently went through bankruptcy, so it was starting to seem like a reboot of&nbsp;The Crow&nbsp;was unlikely. Not so quick! In Auugst, yet another actor became attached, and this time around, it was an actor who already has a much anticipated superhero movie on the way. Future Aquaman star Jason Momoa was reportedly in talks to wear lots of “goth” makeup and clothes from Hot Topic as the moody rock musician-turned-undead superhero The Crow. Momoa’s next major studio movies in the meantime will be Justice League (11/17/17) and the aforementioned Aquaman movie (10/5/18).SEPTEMBER: FOURTEEN YEARS AFTER SHANGHAI KNIGHTS, WAKE UP FOR SHANGHAI DAWNIn 2000, Jackie Chan was at the height of his career as a martial arts action movie star and looking for his next big American crossover hit. So, he starred with Owen Wilson in a western adventure comedy called Shanghai Noon, which made just enough money ($56 million domestic) to spawn a sequel in 2003 called Shanghai Knights.&nbsp; And then… it seemed like that was that, as Chan focused more on making his films in China. Thirteen years later, Chinese box office is bigger than its ever been, and producers in China are looking for projects that will allow them to work both domestically and with Hollywood movie stars (such as Matt Damon in The Great Wall). That brings us back to the Shanghai Noon. As of September, Jackie Chan (now 62) and Owen Wilson (now 47) were in talks to reprise their roles in a third film, Shanghai Dawn. The director will be&nbsp;Jared Hess, whose debut film remains his most famous: Napoleon Dynamite. While that Sundance hit received a Fresh Tomatometer score, Hess has not been able to replicate the feat, with Nacho Libre (40 percent), Gentlemen Broncos (19 percent), and Don Verdean (30 percent) all earning Rotten scores.&nbsp;Shanghai Noon was Certified Fresh at 79 percent, and Shanghai Knights was also Fresh at 66 percent, but the expiration date on this trilogy may have been sometime around 2006.OCTOBER: ICE CUBE AND KEVIN HART TO FINISH THE RIDE ALONG TRILOGYDecades of blockbuster chasing on the part of Hollywood’s studios has steadily decreased the number of star-driven, relatively cheaply produced action comedies that make it to our theaters each year. One such movie that was a confirmed hit was 2014’s Ride Along ($134 million domestic), which was followed earlier this year by Ride Along 2 ($90.8 million domestic). Both movies starred Ice Cube as a police detective and Kevin Hart as his sister’s overly/easily excited boyfriend (who is a police academy cadet in the first movie). While the budget did go up and the box office returns down for the second movie, both turned a tidy profit. As such, Universal Pictures appears to remain committed to making movies with Kevin Hart, because the studio has now begun development&nbsp;on Ride Along 3. To that end, Universal Pictures has hired the screenwriting team of Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi to start working on the script. In addition to the first two Ride Along movies, Hay and Manfredi also worked on R.I.P.D., Aeon Flux, and the Clash of the Titans remake. Neither previous Ride Along movie was able to earn a Tomatometer score above 19 percent, which is why we’re calling Ride Along 3 one of the year’s most Rotten Ideas.NOVEMBER: MAX LANDIS REMAKING HIS DAD’S HORROR COMEDY CLASSIC AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDONThere is a continuing debate about which movies should be remade, and what it means when one chooses to remake a film. On one side, there is the argument that classic films should never be remade (ie, “you can’t do better than that”). On the other hand, some filmmakers think that remakes are a way of honoring the original, like John Carpenter’s The Thing, which is now held in higher regard by many than the original film, 1951’s The Thing From Another World. Unfortunately,&nbsp;most remakes are not better than the originals, like the 2011 pseudo-remake of Carpenter’s The Thing. One of the horror comedies of the 1980s that many fans hold in high esteem is John Landis’ 1981 deconstruction on lycanthropy tropes (“lycantropes,” if you will), An American Werewolf in London, which is Certified Fresh. Though he also directed such favorites as Trading Places, The Blues Brothers, and National Lampoon’s Animal House, An American Werewolf in London treally set the tone for the horror comedy genre that’s blossomed in the decades since. We wanted to heap all that praise before revealing November’s most “Rotten Idea,” which is that John Landis’ son Max Landis has decided to write a remake of An American Werewolf in London for Universal Pictures. The new film will be produced by some of the people behind TV’s The Walking Dead, but no other details are known yet. Max Landis did score a Certified Fresh rating with Chronicle, but all of his other Tomatometer credits are Rotten (such as American Ultra, Victor Frankenstein, Mr. Right, and Me Him Her).DECEMBER: REST IN PEACE, ALL YOU BRILLIANT, BELOVED PEOPLELong before this week (heck, back in April even), people all over the Internet were expressing disbelief at exactly how many beloved celebrities from all forms of entertainment departed our world in 2016. Then, on December 27th, we lost Carrie Fisher, and on the next day, reportedly while preparing Carrie’s funeral plans, her mother Debbie Reynolds died as well. Perhaps because of exactly how bad this year has been, many publications are still waiting until Sunday the 1st to officially publish their “2016 in memoriam” stories (at least for movies). You can browse the list as of Friday the 30th here, but we’ll wrap up this most Rotten of years (in deaths) with a quick summary. Directors we lost this year included Guy Hamilton (Goldfinger and three other Bond movies), Michael Cimino (The Deer Hunter), Abbas Kiarostami (Taste of Cherry), Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride), Hector Babenco (Kiss of the Spider Woman), Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential), and Herschell Gordon Lewis (The Wizard of Gore). Male actors we lost included Angus Scrimm (Phantasm), David Bowie (Labyrinth), Alan Rickman (Die Hard, the Harry Potter franchise), Abe Vigoda (The Godfather), George Gaynes (Police Academy), George Kennedy (Cool Hand Luke, The Naked Gun), Richard Davalos (East of Eden), Larry Drake (Darkman), Garry Shandling (The Garry Shandling Show), Prince (Purple Rain), Ron Lester (Varsity Blues), Anton Yelchin (Star Trek), Kenny Baker (Star Wars), David Huddleston (The Big Lebowski), Gene Wilder (Blazing Saddles, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory), Jon Polito (Miller’s Crossing), Robert Vaughn (The Magnificent Seven), Ron Glass (Serenity), and Don Calfa (The Return of the Living Dead). Actresses that died this year include former First Lady Nancy Reagan (The Next Voice You Hear), Patty Duke (The Miracle Worker), Doris Roberts (Everybody Loves Raymond), Alexis Arquette (The Wedding Singer), Zsa Zsa Gabor (1952’s Moulin Rouge), and of course, Carrie Fisher (Star Wars, When Harry Met Sally) and Debbie Reynolds (Singin’ in the Rain, 1996’s Mother, The Unsinkable Molly Brown). Here’s hoping 2017 treats us a little better than 2016 did.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Anna, Acorn, binge, movies, south, YA, dark, FX, thirty, Nominations, Election, book","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/30170529/Rotten-Ketchup-2016.jpg","slug":"the-12-most-rotten-movie-news-items-of-2016"},{"id":"47509177868563","title":"Sonic the Hedgehog Trailer Backlash Sparks Redesign, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sonic the Hedgehog Trailer Backlash Sparks Redesign, and More Movie NewsAngelina Jolie, Olivia Colman, Lupita Nyong'o, and Jennifer Garner land new roles, while Peter Farrelly, F. Gary Gray, and Kevin Hart tackle new projects.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 3, 2019 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;movies with new roles for&nbsp;Kevin Hart, Angelina Jolie, and Lupita Nyong’o.This WEEK’S TOP STORYSONIC THE HEDGEHOG TRAILER BACKLASH SPARKS REDESIGN(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Let’s start this story off by saying Paramount Pictures should’ve seen this one coming. Back in December, the first silhouetted look at their movie version of Sonic the Hedgehog led to a flurry of mostly-not-very-positive social media reactions, mostly about Sonic’s legs. Keep in mind that Sonic the Hedgehog is a character that’s been depicted in dozens of video games, so there’s an established Sonic “look.” This week, the Sonic the Hedgehog trailer debuted, and the collective fan backlash against Sonic’s design was even louder this time. (The eyes are too small, the nose is at the wrong angle, and the teeth. Where to even begin on the teeth?) The Sonic the Hedgehog missteps are only accentuated by the timing of the trailer in the same week as the first Pokemon Detective Pikachu reviews, as that film has not one but&nbsp;dozens of video game characters that look pretty much exactly like they do in the games. The good news, however, is that Sonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler relatively quickly responded on Twitter, “The message is loud and clear… you aren’t happy with the design &amp; you want changes. It’s going to happen. Everyone at Paramount &amp; Sega are fully committed to making this character the BEST he can be.” Sonic the Hedgehog is scheduled for release on November 8, 2019 (up against Last Christmas, the WWII drama Midway, and The Shining sequel Doctor Sleep).Fresh Developments1. ANGELINA JOLIE TAKES ON THOSE WHO WISH ME DEAD(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)If you’ve heard about one new movie project for Angelina Jolie lately, it was probably Marvel Studios’ The Eternals, but that movie doesn’t start filming until this September. That leaves a few months for Jolie to work on another project, and it’s going to be Those Who Wish Me Dead, the next film from director Taylor Sheridan (Wind River, writer of&nbsp;Sicario and Hell or High Water). Adapted from the novel by Michael Koryta, Those Who Wish Me Dead has a story that’s not easily described in just a few words, but we’ll just tease that it involves Angelina Jolie working on a forest fire lookout tower and a 14-year-old witness to a brutal murder who’s in the woods as part of a witness protection program. Jolie’s costars will include&nbsp;Tyler Perry, Jon Bernthal (The Walking Dead, Netflix’s The Punisher) and Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy, Warm Bodies).2.&nbsp;OSCAR-WINNER OLIVIA COLMAN’S THE FAVOURITE FOLLOW-UP(Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/Fox Searchlight Pictures)Every year, it’s interesting to see what new projects the Academy Award winners will be doing next. Olivia Colman’s speech as the Best Actress winner for The Favourite was one of this year’s highlights, and now we know what’s on the horizon for her. Colman and Anthony Hopkins (who won his own Best Actor Academy Award for Silence of the Lambs) are teaming up for a British drama called The Father, based on a play. Hopkins will play “a mischievous and highly independent man who, as he ages, refuses all assistance from his daughter” (Colman). Olivia Colman will also soon be seen in Netflix’s The Crown as the next actress to play the series’ Queen Elizabeth II after Claire Foy.3. GREEN BOOK DIRECTOR GOING ON THE GREATEST BEER RUN EVER(Photo by Frederic J. Brown/Getty Images)Speaking of follow-ups to this year’s Academy Award winners, let’s move on to Green Book, which won three of the year’s major Oscars: Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor, and the big prize, Best Picture. Director Peter Farrelly’s Tomatometer has more Rotten splotches than Fresh ones, but now he’s got a Best Picture to his credit. This week, Farrelly signed on to write and direct an adaptation of the non-fiction book&nbsp;The Greatest Beer Run Ever: A True Story of Friendship Stronger Than War. Like Green Book, this film will be set in the 1960s, as John “Chickie” Donohue sets off to Vietnam to reunite over some beers with friends who are otherwise pre-occupied with fighting the Vietnam War (yes, really). In related news, one of the Green Book producers confirmed this week that the film’s target audience was “older white people.”4. LUPITA NYONG’O’S WACKY OUTER SPACE BEAUTY PAGEANT COMEDY(Photo by Presley Ann/Getty Images)Lupita Nyong’o most recently starred in Jordan Peele’s Us ( Certified Fresh at 94%), which is still in release and continuing its way up the global box office top 10 for 2019 (it’s currently at #8). Nyong’o recently wrapped filming of a zombie comedy called Little Monsters (costarring Josh Gad), which will premiere on Hulu, and this week, she signed on for another film from the same writer/director. The science fiction comedy is currently untitled, but it was previously called Miss Universe, and has a log line that compares it to “Men in Black meets Miss Congeniality.” So, from those two hints, we can probably guess that it somehow involves a beauty pageant of various aliens, including at least one human (unless Lupita’s playing one of the aliens). Or maybe we’re reading those hints all wrong, and it’s about a secret police force that protects us from beauty pageants.5. THE SUICIDE SQUAD CASTING UPDATE: RATCATCHER AND POLKA-DOT MAN(Photo by Ben Rothstein/Marvel Studios)When Disney fired director James Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 last year (before changing their mind and hiring him back), they left his options open just long enough for Warner Bros. to swoop in and hire him for the soft reboot of The Suicide Squad (8/6/2021). Just based on what we know so far, it’s easy to spot the differences between the Rotten 2016 version&nbsp;and what Gunn’s planning. We don’t know yet who’s going to play King Shark (unless he’s just a big CGI monster), but this week, two of the other new villains-turned-heroes were cast, and neither are big stars. David Dastmalchian is not yet a household name, but you might recognize him from roles in&nbsp;The Dark Knight, Prisoners, and the&nbsp;Ant-Man&nbsp;movies, and now he’s joining The Suicide Squad as the Polka-Dot Man, a supervillain with a costume with super-powered polka dots (yes, really). For Ratcatcher (another fairly obscure villain), Gunn is going with a relative newcomer, Portugal’s Daniela Melchior. As for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Gunn is expected to direct it after The Suicide Squad (8/6/2021), which suggests the earliest we might&nbsp;see it would be sometime in 2022.Rotten Ideas4. KEVIN HART TAKING ON THE EXTREME JOB OF REMAKING A KOREAN COMEDY(Photo by Warner Bros.)Earlier in his film career, Kevin Hart’s Tomatometer was mostly dominated by Rotten splats, and to his credit, he’s been starting to turn things around lately with films like Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (Certified Fresh at 76%) and Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (Certified Fresh at 88%). We’re not going to give Kevin Hart the benefit of the doubt just yet (*cough* The Upside *cough*), but we’re willing to call this week’s news only borderline “Rotten.” Hart is producing — and will probably star in —&nbsp;an English-language remake of the hit South Korean comedy Extreme Job. If he does sign on to star, Hart would be playing a narcotics detective who goes undercover at a fried chicken restaurant to stake out a suspected crime gang, but the stakeout takes a turn when the operation results in unexpected business success. The original version has become South Korea’s top-grossing film of all time since its release just a few months ago.3. THIRD FANTASTIC BEASTS DELAYED UNTIL 2021(Photo by Warner Bros.)Warner Bros. might be forgiven for thinking that they had a “sure thing” with their Fantastic Beasts&nbsp;franchise. Before last year’s Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindlewald, the Harry Potter franchise’s films had always been Certified Fresh and blockbuster box office hits, collectively earning upwards of $8 billion worldwide. That’s not to say&nbsp;The Crimes of Grindlewald&nbsp;was exactly a bomb, considering it earned $653 million worldwide, but those results were probably disappointing. Warner Bros. had been planning on releasing each new film every two years in odd years (2016, 2018, 2020, etc), but this week, the studio pushed Fantastic Beasts 3 back a year to November 12, 2021 instead. Warner Bros. executive Toby Emmerich explained the move by saying that they want to “give the filmmakers time and space to allow their artistry to truly flourish and deliver the best possible film to our fans.” It’s not yet known if Johnny Depp will be returning for the third film.2. THIS WEEK IN VIDEO GAME MOVIES: SAINTS ROW(Photo by John Baer/Overture Films courtesy Everett Collection)If the early reviews are any indication, next week’s Pokemon Detective Pikachu may finally break the long-standing streak of Rotten Tomatometers for movies based on video games.&nbsp;That would be great and all, but that still leaves dozens of Rotten ones to account for. One director hoping to contribute to an upward trend is F. Gary Gray (Straight Outta Compton, The Fate of the Furious), who previously had been trying to get a Kane and Lynch movie going. Gray is now attached to direct a film based on the video game franchise Saints Row, which, over the course of several games,&nbsp;began with the Grand Theft Auto template and took&nbsp;it to increasingly ridiculous settings and themes. How far Gray is willing to go is anybody’s guess.1. JENNIFER GARNER HEADING TO FANTASY CAMP WITH I FEEL PRETTY CREATIVES(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)To her credit, Jennifer Garner continues to find regular work even as the&nbsp;film industry arguably moves further away from the sorts of movies that she’s previously been known for. Unfortunately, for her next film, Garner is signing up to work with two screenwriters whose&nbsp;work has never earned a Fresh score;&nbsp;they haven’t even scored above 46% since the 1990s. Jennifer Garner is signed to star in Fantasy Camp, a comedy set up at mini-major STXfilms, the company behind the same creative team’s most recent film, I Feel Pretty (Rotten at 35%). Garner will play a woman who goes “to a reunion at the theater camp of her youth, Camp Footlights, where she will get the chance to challenge her fears, live out her dreams and finally take the stage.”Like this?

Although the initial news suggested it would have a new cast, we now know that a few actors are returning (Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney, Viola Davis). The biggest new name so far has been Idris Elba (in an unknown role, not Deadshot as previously reported), but a new name emerged this week. John Cena is now in talks to co-star in The Suicide Squad, in what will be his first movie directly based upon a comic book (not counting arguments that Bumblebee was comic-book-adjacent). It’s not officially confirmed yet, but Collider&nbsp;claims that John Cena is up for the role of Peacemaker, which is the character that Dave Bautista would have played. Other new villains that director James Gunn is reportedly introducing in The Suicide Squad are King Shark, Polka-Dot Man, and Ratcatcher.Fresh Developments1. BLACK PANTHER‘S LETITIA WRIGHT FINDING DEATH ON THE NILE &nbsp;(Photo by Marvel Studios)Letitia Wright’s Shuri was arguably the breakout star of last year’s Black Panther (as well as Avengers: Infinity War), but we haven’t seen her parlay the success of that role into a lot of other projects just yet. That said, Wright is in Donald Glover’s Guava Island (which you can watch here), and this week, she landed one of her first big post-Black Panther feature film roles. Letitia Wright will star in next year’s Death on the Nile (10/22/2020), which is both a sequel to 2017’s Murder on the Orient Express&nbsp;and a remake, as&nbsp;Rosalie Otterbourne, one of the lead suspects in Agatha Christie’s oriinal 1937 novel. Director Kenneth Branagh will also reprise his role as Hercule Poirot, and he and Wright will be joined by Gal Gadot and Armie Hammer in what&nbsp;is essentially the second film of a new “Agatha Christie Cinematic Universe.” Meanwhile, Letitia Wright will also star in the English-language remake of Le Brio&nbsp;and co-star with John Boyega in the sci-fi romance Hold Back the Stars.2. THEY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY: MARK WAHLBERG’S SIX BILLION DOLLAR MAN BEING REBUILT(Photo by Patti Perret/Paramount Pictures)Though it’s looking like it will be the lowest-grossing live-action Transformers movie, producer/director Travis Knight’s&nbsp;Bumblebee&nbsp;has still earned close to half a billion dollars worldwide, and its&nbsp;Certified Fresh 92% on the Tomatometer&nbsp;extended a five-film streak for&nbsp;him. All of that put together probably helped&nbsp;him this week, as he is now attached to direct the long-in-development The Six Billion Dollar Man, adapted from the 1970s hit TV series The Six Million Dollar Man (title changed to adjust for inflation). Mark Wahlberg has long been attached to star as Col. Steve Austin, and he remains so. Part of the reason for the delay on The Six Billion Dollar Man was that it was previously a Weinstein Co. production, so it had to find a new home at Warner Bros. following the crisis.3. JANELLE MONÁE JOINED BY ALL STAR CAST IN THRILLER(Photo by James Atoa/Everett Collection)Singer-turned-actress Janelle Monáe will be starring in an untitled “racial thriller” for Lionsgate, and this week, we learned that the film will also feature several familiar faces from film and TV. Monáe’s new co-stars will include Kiersey Clemons (Dope), Jack Huston (Boardwalk Empire), Jena Malone (Donnie Darko, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire), and Gabourey Sidibe (Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire). Janelle Monáe will be starring as “a woman desperately trying to flee her captors,” although the setting and premise is otherwise unknown. This project will mark the feature film debut of the “Bush + Renz” directing team ( https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10065694/ ), who have previously worked on musical videos including Jay-Z’s “Kill Jay-Z.”4. CLINT EASTWOOD MAY DIRECT TRUE STORY THE BALLAD OF RICHARD JEWELL(Photo by Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros.)Some of the&nbsp;many repercussions of Disney’s acquisition of the Fox film and TV properties&nbsp;have been rather surprising. This week, for example, there was news of a director based almost entirely at Warner Bros. since the 1970s who’s now considering switching sides to work for Disney/Fox.&nbsp;That director is&nbsp;Clint Eastwood, who may sign on to direct The Ballad of Richard Jewell. If that name sounds familiar, it may be that you remember the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta,&nbsp;when a security guard named Richard Jewell who discovered a bomb&nbsp;was then accused in the media of actually being the bomber himself (he wasn’t). The Ballad of Richard Jewell has been in development for several years, including a period when it was a starring vehicle for Jonah Hill (who is no longer attached to star).5. TWO NEW PROJECTS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE ALUM KRISTEN WIIG(Photo by Wilson Webb/20th Century Fox)Former Saturday Night Live star Kristen Wiig has a handful of films on the horizon, including&nbsp;Where’d You Go, Bernadette (8/16/2019) and Wonder Woman 1984 (6/5/2020) (as the villain Cheetah), but this week, she secured a couple more.. Wiig’s first new project is Netflix’s A Boy Called Christmas, which will feature British actresses Sally Hawkins (The Shape of Water) and Dame Maggie Smith (Downton Abbey), as well as Jim Broadbent and Toby Jones. Kristen Wiig is also reuniting with her Bridesmaids cowriter Annie Mumolo on a comedy called Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar. Wiig and Mumolo will costar as two friends from a small Midwestern town who “go on vacation in Vista Del Mar, Florida, where they soon find themselves tangled up in a villain’s evil plot to kill everyone in town.”6. JENNIFER LAWRENCE’S MYSTERY INDIE MOVIE(Photo by 20th Century Fox)With The Hunger Games done&nbsp; and the X-Men franchise wrapping up with Dark Phoenix (6/7/2019), Jennifer Lawrence will soon no longer be a part of any major active franchises. While she remains attached to Adam McKay’s Bad Blood as Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, it appears that film’s not yet ready to start production, and in the meantime, Lawrence had taken a year off from working. This week, though, she&nbsp;signed on for her first post-break project, and it’s an indie production instead of a big franchise entry. Lawrence will work with A24 on an untitled drama&nbsp;that will also be the feature film debut of theater director Lila Neugebauer. Nothing else is really known about this project except that it’s scheduled to start filming in New Orleans in June (so it might be set somewhere sunny? Yeah, we’ve got no clue).7. TRAIN TO BUSAN STAR JOINS MARVEL’S THE ETERNALS(Photo by Well Go USA Entertainment)We’ve known for a while that Marvel Studios is reportedly looking to cast an openly gay actor for one of the lead roles in next year’s The Eternals. This week, that scope narrowed considerably with this story claiming that they’re specifically looking for an openly gay actor who’s also of Asian heritage. In addition to Angelina Jolie, Marvel has also cast two Asian actors so far, starting last week with Kumail Nanjiani (The Big Sick, HBO’s Silicon Valley), who is rumored to be playing the super speedster Makkari. The second was South Korean actor Ma Dong-seok, who is probably best known for his role in the zombie movie Train to Busan. Although Marvel Studios has not yet officially announced a release date for The Eternals, it may be their film scheduled for November 6, 2020.Rotten Ideas2. DISNEY SHUTS DOWN FOX’S MOUSE GUARD TWO WEEKS BEFORE FILMINGIt probably shouldn’t be that surprising (maybe just disappointing), but as Disney absorbs their newly acquired Fox properties, some pre-existing Fox projects may end up not happening. We now know this because Disney has pulled the plug on the “high profile” adaptation of the Mouse Guard comic book just two weeks before filming had been scheduled to start. (Whether the “mouse house” objected to Mouse Guard somehow is completely open to speculation.) Mouse Guard was to have been a motion-capture adventure with a cast that included Andy Serkis and Idris Elba, with other cast members likely to be added soon. Despite the sudden shelving, Mouse Guard could still happen someday, as Disney is allowing the project’s producers to shop it around to other studios.1. GET THEE TO A SEQUELERY: THE NUN 2(Photo by Warner Bros.)This week’s The Curse of La Llorona (Rotten at 36%) is the sixth film in The Conjuring “Universe,” and the franchise is showing few signs of slowing down. Annabelle Comes Home is scheduled for June 28, 2019, and The Conjuring 3 is due next year on September 11, 2020. (We should also note the passing of Lorraine Warren, whose life inspired The Conjuring, at the age of 92.) Last year’s The Nun was a spinoff from The Conjuring 2, and the film went on to earn over $365 million worldwide. So, New Line Cinema is also now moving forward on development on a sequel to The Nun, starting with the hiring of screenwriter Akela Cooper, who’s previously worked on Netflix’s Luke Cage series. The Nun received a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 26%. Even if the sequel doubles that score, it would still be Rotten.Like this?

WB hired Gunn to do something of a soft reboot on The Suicide Squad, and at first, it was reported that the second movie would feature an all-new team of supervillains. This week, we learned that detail is only partly true, as the characters of Harley Quinn and Deadshot will return, but the rest of the team will be new. Margot Robbie will reprise her role as Harley Quinn, but it won’t be Will Smith we’ll be seeing as Deadshot, as Idris Elba has signed on instead. Warner Bros. has scheduled The Suicide Squad for release on August 6, 2021, which will be one day over five years after the first Suicide Squad (8/5/2016). As for which DC Comics supervillains will be joining Deadshot and Harley Quinn in the sequel, Collider.com has what they report is the list. Reportedly, the new villains will include Ratcatcher (gender swapped as a woman), the eccentric Batman villain Polka Dot Man, Peacemaker (who was adapted as The Comedian in Alan Moore’s Watchmen), and King Shark, who was a memorable character&nbsp;on TV’s The Flash. As for what Will Smith will be doing with his free time in 2019 instead, he signed on this week to star in King Richard, which will tell the true story of tennis coach Richard Williams, the father of future tennis champions Serena and Venus Williams.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;MARVEL’S THE ETERNALS TO FEATURE FIRST LIVE-ACTION GAY LEAD SUPERHERO (BUT WHO?)(Photo by Marvel Comics)The last few years have seen a series of “firsts” in live action superhero movies: Wonder Woman, Black Panther, and Captain Marvel all represented important first steps (and the news of movies like Blue Beetle and Shang-Chi being developed represent others yet to come). As first reported by the ThatHashtagShow podcast, Marvel is now seeking a (preferably openly gay) actor aged 30-49 (of any ethnicity) who “physically looks like a superhero” for one of the leads in next year’s The Eternals. The story seemed to be confirmed by Marvel production chief Victoria Alonso, who, when asked about it, replied, “the world is ready.” Marvel has not yet announced a release date for The Eternals, but it’s probably the “untitled” project scheduled for November 6, 2020 (presuming Black Widow is the film scheduled for for May 1, 2020). As for which of The Eternals might be the gay character in question, of the three known leads, Ikaris would seem most likely, just by process of elimination (the other two confirmed leads being Sersi and the childlike Piper). Other possibilities include Makkari (based on Mercury), Thanos’ brother Starfox, and even Hercules&nbsp;(who’s not one of the Eternals in the comics, but could be adapted that way for the MCU).2.&nbsp;GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S SECRET ZANBATO ACTION MOVIE(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)A few months ago, Guillermo del Toro (Academy Award winner for The Shape of Water) revealed that he had over 15 screenplays written and ready to go. Included in that list was “Secret Project (Untitled).” Now, we still don’t know for sure what that project is, but we did learn about a previously unknown film that&nbsp;has been “in development for the past six years.” The movie is called Zanbato, and although we’re still missing many details, it’s described as an action movie about a young girl (in the 10-15 year old range) with amazing fighting abilities “like a ninja.” Del Toro is attached not just to write but also to direct Zanbato for Paramount Pictures by way of J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot as the production company. Meanwhile, del Toro is currently in pre-production on his adaptation of Pinocchio for Netflix.3. FINN WOLFHARD, CARRIE COON&nbsp;JOIN THE NEW GHOSTBUSTERS(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)It was less than two months ago&nbsp;that we learned that Sony Pictures is fast-tracking a new Ghostbusters to be directed by Jason Reitman (Juno, Tully, Up in the Air), the son of the first movie’s director, Ivan Reitman. (Sony also gave us a quick teaser trailer to boot, featuring one of the franchise’s most iconic props.) Two weeks later, Sony announced that the new Ghostbusters&nbsp;has been scheduled for release&nbsp;next summer for July 10, 2020. Many details aren’t yet known, but the new&nbsp;film&nbsp;will be a direct sequel to the original film that does not use the continuity of the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot. We can however now report that Carrie Coon (Avengers: Infinity War, TV’s Fargo) and Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things) have been cast as a mother and son who are central to the new film. How their characters connect to the original Ghostbusters isn’t yet known (this writer’s best guess: Egon’s daughter and grandson?).4. INVISIBLE MAN REBOOT BECOMING… INVISIBLE WOMAN INSTEAD?(Photo by Take Five/Hulu)A couple of weeks before the release of the 2017 reboot of The Mummy, Universal Pictures made a big push to promote their “Dark Universe” made up of similar classic monster movies. And then The Mummy opened to disappointing box office numbers, and by the end of that year, Universal’s plans for movies like Bride of Frankenstein (which would have come out February 14, 2019) were scrapped. Even if the “Dark Universe” doesn’t happen, Universal still has a lot invested in these properties, and so some of them will still eventually get made. One of them was The Invisible Man, in which Johnny Depp would have starred. This week, it was confirmed that Depp has disappeared from the reboot, with Elisabeth Moss (The Handmaid’s Tale) now in early talks to star. Details aren’t yet known (such as whether it would be called The Invisible Woman), except that Leigh Whannell (Upgrade, Insidious: Chapter 3) is now writing and will direct the reboot.5. THIS WEEK IN MECHA: METAL GEAR SOLID, GUNDAM, EDGE OF TOMORROW 2(Photo by Nippon Sunrise courtesy Everett Collection)However one defines “mecha,” whether it be human-sized (like Iron Man) or gigantic (like those in Pacific Rim), mecha in Hollywood are still not as prevalent as they are in, say, Japanese anime. This week, however, we learned of development progress for three science fiction projects, all based on pre-existing material, which are likely to feature mecha. Let’s start with the Metal Gear Solid movie, based on the popular and long-running Konami video game franchise. We’ve known for a while now that it’s something of a dream project for Kong: Skull Island director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, but this week, we learned which actor is most likely to star as Solid Snake: Oscar Isaac. No deal is in place just yet, but Isaac came right out and this week, “Metal Gear Solid, that’s the one… I’m throwing my hat in for that one,” to which Vogt-Roberts seemed to give a positive response. Another mecha movie now in development is the sequel to 2014’s Edge of Tomorrow (with Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt expected to return), which is now being worked on by one of the Monster Trucks co-writers. The mecha in Metal Gear Solid is a supporting element, and the mecha in Edge of Tomorrow are human-sized, but the third movie in the news this week is absolutely puts “giant mecha” front and center. Comic book (and LOST) writer Brian K. Vaughn&nbsp;is now working on an adaptation of the popular manga and anime series Gundam for Legendary Entertainment.6.&nbsp;TRACY MORGAN VOICING CAPTAIN CAVEMAN IN&nbsp;SCOOBY-DOO REBOOT(Photo by Ali Paige Goldstein/Paramount)Live-action movies for major franchises nowadays are discussed online years in advance sometimes, but animated movies are still able to evade such scrutiny in some cases. We’re thinking here, for example, of something like last year’s Teen Titans Go! To the Movies. This week’s example is also from Warner Bros., and it’s also an animated feature film based on one of WB’s popular animated TV shows. Warner Bros. is releasing Scooby-Doo next summer on May 15, 2020 (up against A Quiet Place 2, and the week before Fast and Furious 9 and The SpongeBob Movie: It’s a Wonderful Sponge). This week, four of the stars who will be voicing characters were revealed, and one of the characters is a childhood favorite making his bigscreen debut. Captain Caveman made his television debut in 1977, in what was sort of a spoof of Charlie’s Angels, but he went on to make dozens of appearances in other shows, including a few team-ups with the Scooby-Doo gang. Tracy Morgan (30 Rock) will voice Captain Caveman, Gina Rodriguez (Jane the Virgin) will voice Velma, Will Forte will voice Shaggy, and Frank Welker will reprise his role as Scooby himself. The voices behind Fred and Daphne have yet to be announced.7.&nbsp;JOSH GAD, CYNTHIA ERIVO TO BELT OUT RIP VAN WINKLE MOVIE MUSICAL(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Eli Winston/Everett Collection)Arguably, the standout star of last year’s Bad Times at the El Royale (even if it was a box office disappointment) was Broadway star Cynthia Erivo, who is just beginning to make her transition to feature films. To that end, Erivo is partnering with Josh Gad, also of Broadway (The Book of Mormon), but also a Disney musical star with both Frozen and their live-action Beauty and the Beast. Erivo and Gad are both attached to a package at Warner Bros. that will adapt the American folk tale Rip Van Winkle. It’s unclear which of them will actually play the title character, but Cynthia Erivo is described as the project’s “star.” The screenplay is now being adapted by Amanda Idoko, who is working with Warner Bros. on their DC Comics movie Plastic Man.Rotten Ideas2.&nbsp;MALEFICENT: MISTRESS OF EVIL CASTS SURPRISE SPELL ON 2019 RELEASE(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)Going into 2019, it looked like Walt Disney Pictures had loaded up their schedule with three of their live-action remakes (Dumbo, Aladdin, and The Lion King), with the next film after 2019 to be the Maleficent sequel, scheduled for May, 2020. Disney’s likely dominance of the 2019 box office is especially evident when one also factors in their animated features (Toy Story 4, Frozen 2) and Marvel features (Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame). This week, however, Disney&nbsp;really upped the stakes with the revelation that the sequel featuring Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning, now called Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, isn’t a 2020 movie after all, but is now scheduled for October 18, 2019. This sort of sent other studios scrambling (and the reactions might still be forthcoming), starting with Universal’s decision to yank an untitled Blumhouse horror film from that date. The first Maleficent movie, adapted from Disney’s Sleeping Beauty, earned a “Rotten” score in 2014 of 54%, and there isn’t much to indicate this one will fare any better.1.&nbsp;HELLO KITTY&nbsp;IS COMING TO AMERICA (IN A&nbsp;MOVIE)(Photo by Saban International courtesy Everett Collection)We’re now just two months away from Pokémon Detective Pikachu (5/10/2019), the first live-action movie based on the popular and long-running video game franchise from Japanese video game publisher Nintendo. This week, we learned of another iconic Japanese import who is ready to make the jump across the Pacific to star in her first major Hollywood movie. New Line Cinema has acquired the film rights&nbsp;to Hello Kitty from Sanrio in what will be the first English-language feature film based on the character and brand. There isn’t much else we know about the Hello Kitty movie at this point, including whether it will be an animated film or a live action/animated hybrid (an entirely live-action Hello Kitty is probably unlikely). First introduced in 1974, Hello Kitty is a globally successful brand that&nbsp;has been adapted&nbsp;into manga comics, anime TV shows, video games, several Japanese-language movies, and over 50,000 other branded products (and there’s also several Sanrio stores in California and Hawaii). The Hello Kitty movie is being produced for New Line Cinema by Beau Flynn (Rampage, Skyscraper, Baywatch), who hasn’t been involved with a Fresh&nbsp;movie since 2008.Like this?

The main character in this story about the 1967 Newark race riots will be Dickie Moltisanti (played by Alessandro Nivola), the father of Christopher Moltisanti from The Sopranos. (“Moltisanti” translates from Italian as “many saints.”) We’ve also learned recently of the casting of first Jon Bernthal (The Punisher) and Vera Farmiga (Bates Motel), rumored to play Tony Soprano’s parents, and then Corey Stoll (Ant-Man) and Billy Magnussen (Game Night). We know from The Sopranos that Tony Soprano was around during this era, and now we also know that “young Tony” will be played by James Gandolfini’s actual son, Michael Gandolfini, who was also in HBO’s&nbsp;The Deuce. Gandolfini won the opportunity to reprise his father’s most famous role following an “extensive audition process… [and] his screen presence, mastery of Tony’s mannerisms, coupled with his resemblance to the elder Gandolfini made him the standout choice for the role because no one there understood the character better.” New Line Cinema is expected to open&nbsp;The Many Saints of Newark in wide release theatrically, in either late 2019 or sometime in 2020.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;BIRD BOX REUNION: NETFLIX AND SANDRA BULLOCK ARE REBORN(Photo by Netflix)Netflix famously does not disclose viewership numbers&nbsp;for most of their shows and movies. (Very often, pundits are left to guess at numbers based on social media reactions.) That’s why it was significant a few weeks back when the streaming giant confirmed that over 45,000,000 accounts had viewed the thriller Bird Box, breaking the company’s “first seven days” record. Just after Bird Box celebrated the end of its first month on Netflix, the news broke that the company and its Bird Box star are reuniting for another genre-based book adaptation. Sandra Bullock, Netflix, and the producers of IT are teaming up to adapt Mark Millar’s comic book Reborn, which will be directed by Chris McKay (The LEGO Batman Movie, Certified Fresh at&nbsp;90%). Reborn joins a busy slate for Chris McKay, who is also developing adaptations of Jonny Quest, Nightwing (AKA Dick Grayson), and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, all for Warner Bros. Bullock is expected to star as an 80-year-old woman who dies in a Manhattan hospital to find herself Reborn in “the afterlife world of Adystria, a magical land of monsters and dragons where good and evil are waging an eternal war.” Reborn was written by Kick-Ass and Kingsman creator Mark Millar, who signed a lucrative deal in 2017 that also includes Netflix shows based on Millar’s American Jesus and Jupiter’s Legacy.2.&nbsp;EDGAR WRIGHT&nbsp;WORKING ON BABY DRIVER&nbsp;SEQUEL AND&nbsp;PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR FILM(Photo by Wilson Webb/TriStar)It has now been over 18 months since the release of Baby Driver, the long-in-development heist movie from director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), following his high profile departure from Ant-Man. Wright continues to move forward on a sequel, a script for which he says exists in a first draft. In the meantime, he’s now preparing to direct another original project this summer. We don’t know a title or any casting yet, but Edgar Wright’s next film will reportedly be a “psychological horror” film with a female lead set in the Soho district of contemporary London. Exact story details aren’t available, but Wright has cited both Don’t Look Now and Repulsion&nbsp;as inspirations, which suggests a film filled with hallucinations and paranoia.3. RON HOWARD TO ADAPT BESTSELLING HILLBILLY ELEGY FOR NETFLIX(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Universal Pictures)Netflix currently has their most ambitious project to date, Martin Scorsese’s $175+ million mobster epic The Irishman, in post-production, aiming for 2019’s awards season, and is showing little signs of slowing down in their pursuit for major productions. The latest example came this morning with the news that Netflix is committing $45 million to produce director Ron Howard’s&nbsp;adaptation of the bestselling book Hillbilly Elegy. J.D. Vance’s book is a memoir about his childhood growing up in a small town in Ohio after his family moves there from the Appalachian area of Kentucky. Howard and his Imagine Entertainment have a long relationship with Universal Pictures, so the move to Netflix is a major development, with the budget Netflix was willing to put up reportedly being the deciding factor. Ron Howard is coming off last year’s Solo: A Star Wars Story&nbsp;and is currently working on a documentary about opera star Luciano Pavarotti. Hillbilly Elegy is being adapted by screenwriter Vanessa Taylor, who co-wrote The Shape of Water&nbsp;and is also working on the Elizabeth Holmes/Theranos movie Bad Blood.4.&nbsp;NICOLAS CAGE WILL FREAK OUT WHEN HE SEES THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE(Photo by RLJE Films)Horror writer H.P. Lovecraft (1890-1937) may have been one of the most influential writers of the 20th century, but big budget Hollywood has largely ignored his works (although there have been dozens of independent movies). If there’s a single story that best exemplifies the difficulty in adapting Lovecraft to film, it just might be the 1927 short story&nbsp;“The Colour Out of Space.” That’s because the premise revolves around what scientists call an “impossible color” (basically, a color that humans can’t perceive). Put another way, you can’t very well film a color which your human audience can’t see. Well, that story is indeed getting its own movie, Color Out of Space, with Nicolas Cage reuniting with the producers of Mandy (Certified Fresh at 92%). Cage will play a New England small town farmer whose life is turned topsy-turvy following the crash of a meteorite that brings the titular color to Earth. Color Out of Space will be directed by South African director Richard Stanley (Hardware, Dust Devil) as his first feature film in over 20 years since he was (reportedly) fired from directing 1996’s The Island of Dr. Moreau.5. VIN DIESEL CONFIRMS PLANS FOR FEMALE-CENTRIC FAST &amp; FURIOUS SPINOFF(Photo by Scott Garfield/Universal Pictures)As of next Friday, we will be within six months of Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw, the spinoff starring Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. Filming of the next entry (Fast &amp; Furious 9) of the main Fast &amp; Furious franchise will reportedly begin in April, but Vin Diesel confirmed this week that a third branch of the family tree is now being officially developed. Diesel and his producer sister Samantha Vincent took to Instagram to reveal that they have hired three screenwriters to work on a female protagonist-led Fast &amp; Furious spinoff. Lindsey Beer co-wrote next year’s post-apocalyptic thriller Chaos Walking (starring Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley), and is also working on reboots of Short Circuit and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Geneva Robertson-Dworet co-wrote Captain Marvel and last year’s Tomb Raider. As for Nicole Perlman, she co-wrote Guardians of the Galaxy (co-starring Vin Diesel), and is also working on Detective Pikachu, the Labyrinth remake, and Marvel Studios’ Black Widow. We don’t know yet who will star in the spinoff, but Michelle Rodriguez is probably at the top of the list.6. THIS WEEK IN RELEASE DATES: THE CRAWL, JOHN CENA’S PLAYING WITH FIRE, BAD NEWS FOR THE LOUD HOUSE(Photo by Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures)Paramount Pictures announced release dates for two films this week&nbsp;and yanked another project from their schedule completely, signalling that the project has probably been cancelled. The Crawl is a natural disaster horror film about “a young woman who becomes trapped in a flooding house during a Category 5 hurricane and must battle against Florida’s most savage and feared predators,” and it’s now scheduled for August 23, 2019, up against Angel Has Fallen (the sequel to Olympus Has Fallen and London Has Fallen). Playing with Fire is a family comedy about three orphaned kids sent to separate foster homes, with wrestler-turned-actor John Cena starring, along with Judy Greer, John Leguizamo, and Keegan-Michael Key. Playing with Fire is scheduled for March 20, 2020 (the week before Disney’s Mulan remake, and Paramount’s G.I. Joe spinoff Snake Eyes). Finally, Paramount has pulled a movie based on the Nickelodeon animated series The Loud House from their slate, where it had formerly been scheduled for February 7, 2020.7.&nbsp;FORMER DOCTOR WHO MATT SMITH JOINS JARED LETO IN SONY/MARVEL’S MORBIUS(Photo by BBC courtesy Everett Collection)Following the box office success of Venom ($855 million globally as #6 for 2018) and the acclaim and awards given to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Sony Pictures is moving forward confidently with their plans to adapt their share of Marvel’s properties. Jared Leto has been attached to star as the vampire anti-hero Morbius for a while now (with July 10, 2020 speculated to be the film’s target date). The second actor to join Morbius will be Matt Smith, who is still best known to American audiences&nbsp;for playing the 11th incarnation of BBC’s Doctor Who. Smith’s role is currently unknown, but Collider is speculating that&nbsp;he may play Loxias Crown, a friend of the scientist Michael Morbius who takes the same serum but is transformed into a more evil bloodthirsty creature. In related news, we also learned this week that transgender actor Zach Barack has been cast&nbsp;in this summer’s Spider-Man: Far from Home (7/5/2019) in what is a groundbreaking first for a superhero movie of this scale.8. GINA RODRIGUEZ TO STAR IN LONG-IN-DEVELOPMENT BOBBIE SUE(Photo by John Castillo/Indomina Releasing)The fifth and final season of the CW series Jane the Virgin is set to debut in March, and its star Gina Rodriguez is continuing to seek more movie roles&nbsp;(like last year’s Annihilation) to expand her career past television. With that in mind, Warner Bros. has cast Rodriguez to star as Bobbie Sue,&nbsp;which has been in development since 2008. (At one point Cameron Diaz had been attached to star.) Rodriguez will play a young woman from South Boston who is “a scrappy, headstrong young lawyer who lands a career-making case with an upper crust law firm, only to realize she’s been hired for optics and not her expertise.” Bobbie Sue will be directed by Charles Stone III, whose most recent film was last year’s Uncle Drew (63%), and who also directed Drumline (Certified Fresh at 82%) and the baseball comedy Mr. 3000 (54%).Rotten Idea1.&nbsp;KEVIN HART&nbsp;JOINS BODY-SWAP COMEDY&nbsp;BLACK FRIDAY(Photo by Warner Bros.)Put simply, a movie star’s box office status is not defined simply by being in very successful films, but also by their ability to ensure that people will buy tickets for films they might not otherwise. The $20 million opening weekend for The Upside was not itself huge, but significantly more than one might otherwise think a remake of a French movie from 2011 might be. In the last two weeks, Hollywood has been making deals quickly with Kevin Hart’s people, which last week alone included signing Hart to star in the Monopoly movie and a tragic drama called Fatherhood. This week, STXfilms signed Hart for two comedies, the first of which will be a “body swapping fantasy” called Black Friday, which will be followed by an untitled “international romantic comedy.” No other details were revealed about Black Friday, but the title suggests it might the body swapping might be racial in nature. We’re calling this a “Rotten Idea” because STXfilms’ The Upside earned a 39% Tomatometer.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Films, sports, sequel, based, Starz","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/25163300/Michael_Gandolfini_Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"james-gandolfinis-son-to-play-young-tony-soprano-in-film-prequel-plus-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509177878809","title":"John David Washington and Robert Pattinson Join Christopher Nolan’s New Movie, Plus More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})John David Washington and Robert Pattinson Join Christopher Nolan's New Movie, Plus More NewsBlack Widow adds a potential villain, Bill &amp; Ted get a release date, and new roles for Emily Blunt, Cardi B, and Jennifer Lopez.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 22, 2019 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;such titles as Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music, Black Widow, and Masters of the Universe.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJOHN DAVID WASHINGTON, ROBERT PATTINSON JOIN CHRISTOPHER NOLAN’S NEXT FILM(Photo by JA, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Director Christopher Nolan&nbsp;is notoriously secretive about the premises behind his films&nbsp;(we’re thinking here of Inception and Interstellar, in particular). Warner Bros. has scheduled Nolan’s next&nbsp;movie for July 17, 2020 (up against the Bob’s Burgers movie, and the week after Ghostbusters 3), and we still have very little idea what it’s about, but this week, we learned of three stars who&nbsp;have joined the&nbsp;film. The first actor announced was John David Washington, who is coming off the lead role in Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman. Variety reported at the same time that Nolan’s film will be “a massive, innovative, action blockbuster, which will again be shown in Imax,” which is better than nothing, but still not much. The second star to be announced was Robert Pattinson, who first came to fame in the Twilight Saga movies but has mostly been working in independent film since. Finally, we also now know that the first actress announced was Elizabeth Debicki, who recently earned the admiration of critics in Steve McQueen’s&nbsp;Widows. Nolan’s film sounds like it might have an ensemble cast, so there&nbsp;are potentially still be more names yet to be announced.Fresh Developments1. BLACK WIDOW RECRUITS&nbsp;ITS POTENTIAL VILLAIN(Photo by Marvel Studios)Although several of the MCU’s stars were obviously already famous when they landed their roles in the franchise (Robert Downey Jr., Paul Rudd, and Benedict Cumberbatch, for example), some of them were decidedly less so (like Tom Holland, Tom Hiddleston, and Letitia Wright). So, if you want to get ahead of the game, you might want to check out the films of 23-year-old English actress Florence Pugh (Lady MacBeth, Outlaw King), because this week, she started talks for next year’s Black Widow. Although Pugh’s role isn’t known yet, it’s described as a spy on Black Widow’s level, which many sources are interpreting as the film’s main villain (or at least, adversarial) role. (Check out this Hollywood Reporter piece if you want some in-depth speculation about Black Widow.) Florence Pugh’s agents were busy this week, as she’s also now signed to star in the decades-spanning drama The Secret Ingredients of Rocket Cola, which will be directed by Scrubs star Zach Braff.2. MICHAEL B. JORDAN PRODUCING SECRET MONSTER MOVIE(Photo by Marvel Studios)Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts (Kong: Skull Island) is not yet a household name, but he could be on his way, especially after his Metal Gear Solid dream project gets produced. Creed&nbsp;and&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;star&nbsp;Michael B. Jordan’s Outlier Society production company has now stepped up to team up with&nbsp; Vogt-Roberts to produce what is described as a monster movie set in Detroit&nbsp;(Vogt-Roberts’ hometown). The secret monster movie is also being produced by New Regency, which is also producing the upcoming Brad Pitt outer space drama Ad Astra (5/24/2019).3. NEW TITLES FOR DORA THE EXPLORER, ANNABELLE, AND TERMINATOR MOVIES(Photo by New Line Cinema)Presumably coincidentally, three big new movies (previously just known by their franchies) received their actual release titles this week. Let’s start with the Dora the Explorer movie, which lost 2/3 of that franchise title as the movie is now titled Dora and the Lost City of Gold (8/2/2019), as we can see on the new posters (which also show off the CGI Boots the monkey). Another franchise entry due out this year is the third Annabelle horror movie, which is now called Annabelle Comes Home (6/28/2019). Later this year, we’ll be getting the latest Terminator reboot, now called Terminator: Dark Fate (11/1/2019). Finally, there’s the Sopranos prequel The Many Saints of Newark (9/25/2020), which is back to that title after briefly being&nbsp;shortened to&nbsp;Newark by some sources.4. EMILY BLUNT WILL&nbsp;NOT FADE AWAY(Photo by Glen Wilson/Universal Pictures)Emily Blunt has now wrapped her role in Disney’s Jungle Cruise movie (7/24/2020), based on their long-running theme park attraction, and won’t start filming the sequel to A Quiet Place (5/15/2020) until this summer. This week, Blunt started talks to star in Not Fade Away, an adaptation of the 2015 memoir Not Fade Away: A Memoir of Senses Lost and Found by Rebecca Alexander,&nbsp;as the author herself, who was “born with a rare genetic mutation that caused her to lose her sight and hearing over time, beat the odds and expectations of her prognosis.” Blunt’s husband John Krasinski will also produce the adaptation, along with director David O. Russell (Three Kings, American Hustle).5. JENNIFER LOPEZ AND CARDI B TEAMING UP&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;HUSTLERS(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Like many (many) singers/rappers before her, Cardi B is preparing to make the transition to the big screen as an actress, as she will make her film debut&nbsp;in the drama Hustlers, about a group of ex-strippers who unite to take on Wall Street. The Hustlers at Scores, an article originally published in New York magazine, was the inspiration for the film. Cardi B will be part of an ensemble cast&nbsp;that also includes singers/actresses Jennifer Lopez and Keke Palmer, as well as Julia Stiles and Crazy Rich Asians star Constance Wu. STXfilms will distribute Hustlers, which started filming today in New York City.6. BILL &amp; TED FACE THE MUSIC NEXT AUGUST(Photo by Orion)Bill &amp; Ted’s Excellent Adventure (Fresh at 78%) is a beloved 1980s teen comedy classic, and even if its sequel,&nbsp;Bill &amp; Ted’s Bogus Journey (Rotten at 54%), wasn’t as warmly received, the franchise retains a big enough fanbase that news of a potential new sequel was cause for celebration.&nbsp;With that in mind, Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves went to the Hollywood Bowl to film their announcement video letting fans know that they expect to start filming this summer, aiming for a release next year of August 21, 2020. (We should point out that the last two weeks of August are sometimes considered a “dumping ground;” the comparable date last year is when A.X.L. and The Happytime Murders came out.) Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music will be directed by Dean Parisot, whose filmography is mostly Rotten (Home Fries, Red 2), but he did give us&nbsp;Galaxy Quest, so here’s hoping he channels some of that energy into this movie.7. MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE CASTS YOUNG NETFLIX HUNK AS HE-MAN(Photo by Cartoon Network)Noah Centineo may not be particularly well-known to anyone who didn’t&nbsp;love the Netflix rom-coms To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before and Sierra Burgess is a Loser. Someone at Sony Pictures is clearly a fan, though, because that studio has cast&nbsp;the young actor to play the new He-Man in their long-in-development reboot of Masters of the Universe. That means the Netflix star will be stepping into the same muscle harness (symbolically at least) worn by Dolph Lundgren in the Rotten 1987 adaptation&nbsp;Masters of the Universe (Rotten at 17%). Centineo also recently worked with Sony on another reboot they’ve been working on for a while, namely this year’s Charlie’s Angels (11/1/2019), starring Kristen Stewart, Elizabeth Banks, and Naomi Scott (AKA Jasmine in Disney’s live-action Aladdin).Rotten Ideas2. THE&nbsp;CLASH OVER&nbsp;THE FLASH(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although it’s easy to look back at the Marvel Cinematic Universe as something that exploded, fully formed, into existence, Marvel Studios only released The Avengers after four of its members had already had their own solo movies. Warner Bros. and DC Comics did the opposite with Justice League, which featured three heroes (Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash) who had not had their own movies yet, even if&nbsp;all three were planned. In those original plans, The Flash would have received his solo movie last year, starring Ezra Miller, with Cyborg and Green Lantern getting their movies next year (they’re not). There is reportedly a clash over The Flash, with screenwriters John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (Spider-Man: Homecoming) creating a lighter tone, while Ezra Miller wants the movie to be darker. Hoping to save his place as The Flash, Miller is now working on his own screenplay with comics writer Grant Morrison. As we can see with Aquaman and Shazam, the new direction with DC Comics movies seems to be lighter and more fun, which, ironically, is how many fans would describe The Flash.1. DISNEY FINALIZES FOX DEAL BUT IT’S NOT ALL GOOD NEWS&nbsp;(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)This week, Disney finalized its $71.3 billion deal to acquire the entertainment assets of the Fox film and TV studios. The deal has been widely applauded by Marvel Comics fans who are eager to see the X-Men and Fantastic Four characters and properties join the MCU&nbsp;(though probably not until 2021 or 2022). However, that also means that some or many of the projects that Fox had been developing may be shelved, including X-Force, X-23, Kitty Pryde, and Madrox the Multiple Man. There are also behind-the-scenes developments that aren’t necessarily “fresh developments.” For example, the Fox 2000 division,&nbsp;which will finish the projects already in production (ending with&nbsp;The Woman in the Window, starring Amy Adams),&nbsp;was shut down this week. That leaves a few movies “on hold,” including titles like League of Wives (starring Reese Witherspoon) and Paul Greengrass’ Civil War drama News of the World (starring Tom Hanks). Forbes has more on all of this right here. Director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, The Heat) has also moved his production company from Fox to Universal Pictures. Finally, the most “Rotten” news of all of this: the deal is also expected to lay off some 4,000 Fox employees.Homepage image&nbsp;by Melinda Sue Gordon @ Warner Bros.

This week we learned that, in 2022, Tom Cruise will hit movie #8 in his long-running Mission: Impossible franchise, as Mission: Impossible 7 and Mission: Impossible 8 are being developed for releases&nbsp;in the summers of 2021 and 2022, respectively. Paramount is aiming to achieve this goal by hiring writer/director Christopher McQuarrie to work on both sequels, following what he’s done on the last two films, 2015’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (Certified Fresh at 93%) and last year’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout (Certified Fresh at 97%). The two movies will be shot back-to-back to ensure their releases within a year of each other, and also to make it easier to schedule not just Tom Cruise, but his supporting cast, which may include Fallout co-stars like Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, etc. We don’t have any indication what Mission: Impossible 7 (2021) and Mission: Impossible 8 (2022) might be about, but they will probably feature Tom Cruise doing some of his own crazy stunts. Cruise’s next film will be the sequel Top Gun: Maverick (6/26/2020), and he will also be celebrating his 60th birthday on July 3, 2022, possibly around the same time that Mission: Impossible 8 will be released.Fresh Developments1. AN ACTUAL GHOSTBUSTERS 3 IS NOW FAST-TRACKED FOR SUMMER, 2020(Photo by Columbia courtesy Everett Collection)We’ve been seeing year-after-year of reboots and remakes, but only very rarely are&nbsp;they overturned by later films. If you were a big fan of 2016’s Ghostbusters (Certified Fresh at 74%), we have some bad news for you, as Sony is now&nbsp;pulling an about-face. Rather than moving forward with a sequel starring Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones, Sony is aiming to produce&nbsp;a&nbsp;Ghostbusters 3 that&nbsp;will&nbsp;extend&nbsp;the continuity that started with the 1984 movie starring&nbsp;Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson. Ghostbusters 3 will be a legacy sequel, with Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air, Tully)&nbsp;taking over from his father Ivan Reitman. Ghostbusters 3 will reportedly feature the teenage kids of the original Ghostbusters, possibly comprised of two daughters and two sons. We even already&nbsp;got a teaser trailer this week for the sequel, which is aiming for a summer 2020 release. In related news, Bill Murray is now signed to reunite with his Lost in Translation director Sofia Coppola for&nbsp;On the Rocks, co-starring Rashida Jones.2. BLACK PANTHER‘S NOT THE ONLY AFRICAN KING GETTING A SEQUEL: COMING TO AMERICA 2The 1988 blockbuster comedy hit Coming to America&nbsp;was #3 at the box office that year,&nbsp;preceding by three decades&nbsp;the success of another African king in last year’s Black Panther. We already know Black Panther is getting a sequel, but now we can count on one for the former as well.&nbsp;Eddie Murphy is signed to return&nbsp;as Akeem Joffer of Zamunda for Coming to America 2, which will be directed by Craig Brewer (Hustle &amp; Flow, Black Snake Moan). Murphy and Brewer are coming off their recent collaboration on Netflix’s upcoming Rudy Ray Moore biopic, Dolemite is My Name.3. HUNCHBACK (OF NOTRE DAME)&nbsp;GETTING LIVE-ACTION TREATMENTThere are absolutely no signs of Walt Disney Pictures slowing down their live-action adaptations of their classic animated films anytime soon (setting aside whether The Lion King is “live action”). In addition to all of the films in development, the next five on Disney’s upcoming slate are Dumbo (3/29/2019), Aladdin (5/24/2019), The Lion King (7/19/2019), Mulan (3/27/2020), and Maleficent II (5/29/2020). We can now add Hunchback, an adaptation of 1996’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame, to the mix, as Josh Gad is now producing the remake for Disney. (Gad is a frequent Disney star, including Frozen, Beauty and the Beast, and Frozen 2.) Gad is not currently expected to star, but that could change with time. Meanwhile, another project, Pinocchio apparently hit a snag over the holidays, with Paddington 2 director Paul King recently walking away (while Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio is now in development at Netflix).4. SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME TRAILER REVEALS MYSTERIO AND THE “ELEMENTALS”(Photo by Sony Pictures Entertainment)An all-too-common complaint about trailers is that they reveal too much, with the best ones arguably just whetting our appetite without giving away the whole narrative. This summer’s Spider-Man: Far from Home (7/5/2019) has a very thin line to walk indeed, as its mere existence could be a “spoiler” for Avengers: Endgame (4/26/2019). Let’s focus instead on what this trailer actually does show, which is Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio fighting mysterious monsters called “The Elementals.” In the trailer, Mysterio appears to be acting as a superhero, but many fans were quick to point out that in his first appearance in 1964, Mysterio similarly pretended to be heroic, as he’s traditionally one of Spider-Man’s longest-running super villains. (Let’s note here that 1964 is some 40 years before Syndrome did something similar in 2004’s The Incredibles.) As for the Elementals, three different “Easter Eggs” in the trailer seem to suggest that they could actually be Spider-Man’s villains Hydro-Man, Molten Man, and Sandman (or those could be fakeouts too).5. STEVEN SPIELBERG FINDS HIS WEST SIDE STORY REMAKE’S MARIA, ANITA, BERNARDO, AND CHINOSteven Spielberg is getting closer to filming his remake of West Side Story, starring Ansel Elgort as Tony, with the original film’s Rita Moreno also cast in a supporting role. What we didn’t know until this week, however, was who would be playing the film’s female lead, Maria (played by Natalie Wood in 1961), or her best friend Anita (Moreno’s original role). Those big reveals came this week as we learned that Maria will be played by 17-year-old Colombian-American newcomer Rachel Zegler. (You can watch Rachel Zegler performing various songs on her YouTube channel right here.) Anita will be played by Ariana DeBose, who was nominated for a Tony Award in 2018 for playing Donna Summer. Anita’s boyfriend Bernardo will be played by David Alvarez (Tony winner for Billy Elliot: The Musical), and Maria’s would-be-fiancee Chino will be played by Andrés Rivera (of the Hamilton national touring company). Spielberg also reportedly met recently with faculty and students at the University of Puerto Rico about their concerns of how their community will be portrayed in this West Side Story update.6. ANNE HATHAWAY WILL LEAD THE WITCHES REMAKERobert Zemeckis‘ recent adaptation of the documentary Marwencol, called Welcome to Marwen (Rotten at 31%), was both critically panned and a box office bomb. For his next film, Zemeckis is aiming for a more conventionally popular project, with a remake of 1990’s The Witches, which was an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s 1983 children’s novel. Anne Hathaway is now attached to star in The Witches as the “Grand High Witch,” the role played in 1990 by Anjelica Huston. The 1990 movie was itself a box office bomb, earning just $10 million, but the film has arguably become a family favorite in the 29 years since. Robert Zemeckis’ new adaptation of Dahl’s novel will be set in the “Gothic South in the 1960s,” with Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) also writing and producing along with both Guillermo del Toro (The Shape of Water, Pan’s Labyrinth) and Alfonso Cuarón (Roma, Gravity).Rotten Ideas3. KEVIN HART PASSES GO, WILL COLLECT (AT LEAST) $200, IN MONOPOLY&nbsp;(Photo by Warner Bros.)Kevin Hart may not be hosting this year’s Academy Awards, but his career is otherwise moving along quite nicely following the $20 million opening weekend for The Upside. Within a few days of those numbers being confirmed, Kevin Hart was quickly attached to two different films, including one that’s pretty high profile. The idea of a movie based on the classic Monopoly board game has been kicking around for over a decade, including a time when Ridley Scott was attached, but the Monopoly movie we’ll actually get sounds like a drastic switch. Hart will star in Monopoly for Lionsgate and Hasbro, with his Ride Along director Tim Story also on board. If we&nbsp;disregard&nbsp;his two Kevin Hart concert movies, Tim Story currently has a seven-movie Rotten streak going that includes Fantastic Four (27%), the aforementioned Ride Along (19%), and Ride Along 2 (13%). Kevin Hart’s second new project this week is called Fatherhood, based on the Matthew Logelin memoir Two Kisses for Maddy. Paul Weitz (Admission,&nbsp;Little Fockers) will direct the tragic drama, in which Hart will play a newly single father after his high school sweetheart dies in childbirth.2. VIDEO GAME MOVIES STILL ROTTEN, HOLLYWOOD STILL MAKING MOVIES LIKE JUST DANCE(Photo by Alessio Bolzoni/Amazon Studios)We frequently talk about how bad video game-based movies have been over the years; there isn’t a single Fresh film among the&nbsp;47-plus&nbsp;that have been made. That may change this year with movies like Detective Pikachu&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sonic the Hedgehog, but even if one of them does earn a Fresh score, it would only be a small dent in the genre’s infamous reputation. In the grand Hollywood tradition of doing something over and over again and expecting a different result,&nbsp;we learned about another attempt to bring a video game to the big screen this week, namely the long-running Just Dance franchise. Screen Gems won an auction to the Just Dance rights after competitive bidding. In related news, Warner Bros’ long-in-development Minecraft movie attracted a new director&nbsp;this week in Peter Sollett, who directed Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 74%) and 2015’s Freeheld (Rotten at 48%).1. FINAL DESTINATION FRANCHISE BEING BROUGHT BACK FROM THE DEAD(Photo by New Line courtesy Everett Collection)The first Final Destination movie in 2000 earned just a 34%&nbsp;on the Tomatometer, but it inspired a franchise with four more sequels, only one of which scored above 48%. It can be argued that Final Destination, in which the survivors of lethal events are then haunted by death, trying to even the score, was somewhat ahead of its time, given the more recent success of franchises like Insidious and IT. The screenwriting team of Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, who worked on Saw IV, Saw V, and Saw VI, have now landed a new gig at New Line Cinema, working on rebooting the Final Destination franchise. Those Saw movies, likewise, have pretty Rotten Tomatometers (18%, 13%, and 39%).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"binge, child's, Vudu, halloween, TNT","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/18112634/McQuarrie_Cruise_Mission_Impossible_Ketchup.jpg","slug":"mission-impossible-7-and-8-are-coming-in-2021-and-2022-plus-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509179197731","title":"Denis Villeneuve’s Dune Recruits Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgard, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Denis Villeneuve's Dune Recruits Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgard, and More Movie NewsWB plans to start The Batman, Depp-less Pirates moves forward, the next Star Trek voyage has been cancelled, and lots of new casting stories.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 11, 2019 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news, covering stories from the last few weeks (because of the holidays) for titles such as The Batman, Dune, Jumanji 3, Disney’s reboot of Pirates of the Caribbean, and Venom 2.This WEEK’S TOP STORYDUNE REMAKE RECRUITS DAVE BAUTISTA AND STELLAN SKARSGARD(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection, Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images)Blade Runner 2049, the&nbsp;2017 science fiction sequel directed by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) may have been a relative box office disappointment, but it was also Certiified Fresh at 87%, and as the expression goes, “that’s not nothing.” Denis Villeneuve is&nbsp;also set to revisit another 1980s sci-fi film that underperformed at the box office, but this time, it’s a straight up remake/reboot. We’re speaking of David Lynch’s Dune, the Frank Herbert adaptation that earned less than its production budget upon release in 1984. For his Dune, Denis Villeneuve has already cast Timothée Chalamet (Call Me By Your Name, Lady Bird) as the film’s lead character, Paul Altreiedes, and Rebecca Ferguson (of the Mission: Impossible franchise) as his mother. Dune has a large ensemble cast of characters, and this week, Villeneuve focused on the Houe Harkonnen. Stellan Skarsgard, who co-starred in Marvel’s Thor movies, has been cast as the blister-plagued villain Baron Harkonnen (hope&nbsp;he likes hours in the makeup chair). Dave Bautista, who played Marvel’s Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy and had a small role in Blade Runner 2049,&nbsp;has also joined Dune as “the Beast, Rabban,” in a casting decision which suggests the character will have a higher profile than he did in David Lynch’s film. Dune does not yet have a release date (but it’s expected to be sometime in 2020).Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;HENRY WINKLER JOINS WES ANDERSON’S THE FRENCH DISPATCH(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Throughout much of his career, director Wes Anderson has specialized in working with large ensemble casts, notably starting with 2001’s The Royal Tenenbaums (Certified Fresh at 80%). We’ve known for a few months now that Anderson’s next film will be called The French Dispatch, and that it will be set in the Paris bureau of an American newspaper (possibly during the years after World War II). The latest actor to join the film’s ensemble&nbsp; is Henry Winkler, who’s probably most famous for his long-running role as The Fonz on TV’s Happy Days but has also had memorable roles on&nbsp;Arrested Development and&nbsp;the new HBO series&nbsp;Barry, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe. The French Dispatch will feature such Wes Anderson alumni as Mathieu Amalric, Bob Balaban, Adrien Brody, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, Saoirse Ronan, Léa Seydoux, Tilda Swinton, and Owen Wilson. Others who are joining Winkler as first-time actors working with Wes Anderson include Timothée Chalamet, Benicio del Toro, Lois Smith, and Jeffrey Wright.2. AWKWAFINA AND DANNY DEVITO JOIN JUMANJI 3(Photo by Warner Bros., Byron Cohen/FXX)The original Jumanji was arguably a star feature for mostly just Robin Williams (at best, Kirsten Dunst’s star was also on the rise). For 2017’s Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (Certified Fresh at 76%), the formula was expanded to include four stars (Jack Black, Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart, and Dwayne Johnson). It sounds like we can expect this year’s third Jumanji (12/13/2019) to expand the video game roster even further, with both Awkwafina&nbsp;and Danny DeVito now joining the franchise. We should note that nothing has yet been revealed about their characters, including whether they are video game avatars, NPCs, or “real world” players. Jumanji 3&nbsp;comes as Awkwafina prepares to film two sequels to last year’s Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;(and she’s also voicing a character in this summer’s The Angry Birds Movie 2). Danny DeVito will likewise be coming off his co-starring role in Disney’s live-action remake of Dumbo (3/29/2019).3. ARETHA FRANKLIN BIOPIC&nbsp;RESPECT GETS A DIRECTOR(Photo by Derek Storm/Everett Collection)Dreamgirls and American Idol star Jennifer Hudson is currently filming her role as Grizabella in this year’s Cats (12/20/2019), but the pieces are already&nbsp;falling into place&nbsp;for her next major movie musical, namely&nbsp;Respect, MGM’s biopic about the life of R&amp;B singer (and many other things) Aretha Franklin, who died last year at the age of 76. Respect will mark the feature film debut of stage director Liesl Tommy, whose Eclipsed received six Tony nominations, including Best Director (making Tommy the first African American woman to be nominated in that category). Tommy will be working from a screenplay by Thelma &amp; Louise screenwriter Callie Khouri, who was the showrunner of TV’s dramatic series Nashville.4. THE LAST THREE WEEKS IN TOM HANKS: MISTER ROGERS&nbsp;AND&nbsp;BIOS(Photo by Sony Pictures)The Weekly Ketchup for the first full week in January also covers all of the previous weeks going back past Christmas, which, for the sake of consolidating news stories, means that we get to cover two separate Tom Hanks movies. Hanks wrapped up filming of the film in which he plays PBS star Fred Rogers in November, but it had remained “untitled” for a while after the early title You Are My Friend was dropped. We can now report that the film will be called&nbsp;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, which directly borrows from Rogers’ signature song, when&nbsp;it is released on October 18, 2019 as an early “awards season” contender. For his next film, Tom Hanks is returning to the post-apocalyptic future (a la Cloud Atlas) in BIOS, as an ailing inventor who builds a robot to keep his dog company after he’s gone. That robot, with the help of motion capture animation, will be played by Caleb Landry Jones, who in 2017 had a significant role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Miguel Sapochnik, who directed the Emmy-winning “Battle of the Bastards” episode of Game of Thrones, will be directing BIOS for Universal Pictures.5. WARNER BROS. HOPES TO START FILMING THE BATMAN LATER THIS YEAR(Photo by Zack Snyder)Sometimes big movie news stories are “buried ledes” in other stories. One such example came this week as we learned that Warner Bros. is eyeing a production start for The Batman in November, 2019 in a larger piece speculating about the year in general. There are still many things we don’t know about The Batman, including who might be cast now that we’re 99% sure that Ben Affleck is done with playing Bruce Wayne. (Many of those questions are asked in this Hollywood Reporter piece.) One thing that we do know now is that director/writer Matt Reeves (War for the Planet of the Apes) has turned in his final draft for The Batman, which is ostensibly why Warner Bros. feels the pieces are coming together for a start as early as this year. Other Batman-related projects that Warner Bros has coming soon include this year’s Joker (10/4/2019) and next year’s Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) (2/7/2020), starring Joaquin Phoenix and Margot Robbie, respectively.Rotten Ideas4.&nbsp;PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN REBOOT MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT JOHNNY DEPP(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Deciding where to draw the sometimes thin line between what is a Fresh or Rotten story can sometimes be a tricky proposition. For example, one could look at the declining Tomatometer scores for Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and say that, therefore, any future Pirates movie is not only “Rotten,” but very much so. The latest news is that Walt Disney Pictures appears to be developing a Pirates of the Caribbean reboot,&nbsp;which would move forward without Johnny Depp’s Jack Sparrow character. That, then, begs the question, of whether Jack Sparrow has helped drag down the Pirates Tomatometer, and a new lead might return the franchise to the Certified Fresh status of the first film. Nothing is confirmed yet, but there are indications that the franchise’s new lead will be the female pirate called Captain Redd. One of the key factors suggesting that rumor is the raised profile that Disney is giving to Redd, both in toys, and on the Pirates of the Caribbean park ride itself. Having said that, there are still enough unknowns here that any new Pirates of the Caribbean movie is still a borderline Rotten Idea until we learn more.3.&nbsp;ANGRY BIRDS SEQUEL DROPPING THIS SUMMER(Photo by Columbia Pictures)Video game adaptations remain arguably the most reliably Rotten type of movie. Sometimes, movies like The Angry Birds Movie are still able to attract an audience ($352 million globally) despite a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 44%. As such, Sony Pictures quickly started production of The Angry Birds Movie 2, which is already scheduled for release this summer, on August 16, 2019 (up against Playmobil: The Movie). The new voice cast will include&nbsp;pop singer Nicki Minaj, rising star Awkwafina (who also recently joined Jumanji 3), Saturday Night Live star Leslie Jones, This is Us star Sterling K. Brown, and Eugenio Derbez (of last year’s Overboard remake). These new voice actors will join such cast members from the first movie as Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Bill Hader, Danny McBride, and Jason Sudeikis.2. SONY BITES INTO ITS SEQUEL PLANS FOR THE NEXT VENOM(Photo by Sony Pictures)There is such a conspiracy theory out there about the Tomatometer scores of Marvel movies that when one types in “disney pays” into Google, the first auto-feed option is “Rotten Tomatoes.” (If only we had a page on the site that explains how Tomatometers work.) One of the lowest Tomatometer scores delivered to a major motion picture in 2018 went to Venom (Rotten at 28%), which, despite that score, was still able to earn over $855 million globally as the year’s #6 film. Obviously, Sony Pictures is moving forward with a Venom sequel,&nbsp;which is expected to take the slot they’ve reserved for October 2, 2020. To that end, Sony has hired Kelly Marcel, one of the first film’s co-writers to work on the sequel, which is expected to feature Woody Harrelson’s end-credits serial killer character, Cletus Kasady, AKA Carnage. Tom Hardy will obviously return, and Michelle Williams is expected to return as well. Director Ruben Fleischer will be busy with Zombieland 2, so a new director is currently being sought by Sony.1.&nbsp;THE NEXT&nbsp;STAR TREK VOYAGE HAS BEEN CANCELLED(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Previously in this column up above, we mentioned how big movie stories are sometimes “buried ledes,” and that applies to this week’s most Rotten news. Let’s start with this piece about HBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series, and how the pilot will be directed by one S.J. Clarkson. In the second paragraph, referencing the fourth Star Trek with the current cast, the article casually states, “That project has since been shelved.” Luckily, we have other sources, like Scott Mendelson of Forbes, who can take six words and delve into many more details. That just leaves us to clarify that the first three movies all received Certified Fresh scores: Star Trek (94%), Star Trek Into Darkness (85%), and Star Trek Beyond (85%). So the decision to retire the “Kelvin” cast after just three movies is a “Rotten Idea” because they were still delivering Certified Fresh Tomatometer scores. Having said that, we still don’t know what will become of Quentin Tarantino’s Star Trek idea.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"DirecTV, San, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/11175054/Bautista_Skarsgard_Dune_Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"denis-villeneuves-dune-recruits-dave-bautista-and-stellan-skarsgard-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509179170078","title":"Aquaman Is Getting a Sequel and a Horror Spinoff, Plus More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Aquaman Is Getting a Sequel and a Horror Spinoff, Plus More Movie NewsThe Breaking Bad sequel film will debut on Netflix, Red Sonja is delayed, and new roles for Black Panther, Star-Lord, and Captain America.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 15, 2019 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;such titles as&nbsp;Aquaman 2, Breaking Bad, Coming to America 2, Dune, and Wicked.This WEEK’S TOP STORYAQUAMAN GETTING BOTH A SEQUEL AND A HORROR MOVIE SPINOFF(Photo by Warner Bros.)With over $1.121 billion, Aquaman is now the highest grossing DC Comics movie (worldwide) ever, even above The Dark Knight, etc. That’s quite an achievement for a character long considered a joke (including a long-running story arc on HBO’s Entourage). All indications suggest that Warner Bros. is taking its cue from the successes of both Aquaman and Wonder Woman to tilt the tone of future movies away from the “grimdark” of Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder’s films. Those numbers also made it super obvious that Aquaman would get a sequel,&nbsp;and that’s exactly what’s happening, with one of the first film’s screenwriters now working on a follow-up. Aquaman director James Wan is on board as producer, but it’s unclear as to whether he will also direct the sequel. Warner Bros. isn’t stopping there, however, as they’ve also hired two “newbie” screenwriters to work on a horror movie spinoff called&nbsp;The Trench, about the ” deadly amphibious creatures seen attacking the hero and his love, Mera” in Aquaman. The main characters from Aquaman are not expected to appear in The Trench, which suggests that the “horror movie” may instead focus on surface dwellers who come into contact with the monsters separate from any involvement with Atlantis. It’s also possible that Aquaman 2 and The Trench could just be the start of a new franchise of Aquaman related films in the same way that&nbsp;Batman has led to movies for Suicide Squad, Joker, Birds of Prey, etc.Fresh Developments1. AQUAMAN AND THANOS JOIN THE STAR-STUDDED DUNE REBOOT(Photo by Jasin Boland/Warner Bros., Marvel Studios)Director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) is following his sequel to a beloved 1980s sci-fi movie (Blade Runner 2049) with a reboot of another. Even before this week, the Dune reboot had an impressive cast&nbsp;that included&nbsp;Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, Rebecca Ferugson, Oscar Isaac, Charlotte Rampling, Stellan Skarsgard, and Zendaya, all supporting Timothée Chalamet as the lead character of Paul Atreides. The latest two stars both hail from recent superhero movies: Aquaman and Avengers: Infinity War. Jason Momoa, who’s coming off the highest grossing DC Comics movie ever (as mentioned above), is joining Dune to play the Atreides’ swordsmaster Duncan Idaho, the only character to appear in all six of Frank Herbert’s original Dune novels. Josh Brolin, who plays Marvel’s Thanos, is also joining Dune&nbsp;as Gurney Halleck, another Atreides follower who, in David Lynch’s film, was played by Patrick Stewart.2. JESSE PINKMAN’S BREAKING BAD MOVIE TO DEBUT ON NETFLIX(Photo by Ursula Coyote/AMC)In November, we learned that Aaron Paul would be returning as Jesse Pinkman for a Breaking Bad sequel movie. This week, we learned more about what exactly a Breaking Bad movie&nbsp;would be&nbsp;(as in, is it a theatrical movie, a cable movie, or something else?). The answer, as is becoming more and more common these days, is that the new film will premiere on Netflix first before eventually making its way to&nbsp;AMC, the channel that originally produced and aired&nbsp;Breaking Bad (and still produces its spinoff series Better Call Saul). The movie is reportedly still being written, and it’s not yet known if there will be a role for Bryan Cranston as Walter White, but Cranston said recently that he’d be open to return, if asked. The last four seasons of Breaking Bad were all Certified Fresh at 100%. Here’s a breakdown of everything we know about the film.3.&nbsp;BLACK PANTHER‘S CHADWICK BOSEMAN JOINS SPIKE LEE’S DA 5 BLOODS(Photo by Marvel Studios)Speaking of Netflix, they’re also stepping in to help director Spike Lee&nbsp;(Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X) deliver his next film after last year’s Academy Award nominee BlacKkKlansman (Certified Fresh at 95%). Spike Lee’s film for Netflix is called Da 5 Bloods, and is a drama dealing with the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Delroy Lindo will star as a veteran who leads a group back to Vietnam searching for “the remains of a fellow soldier and hidden gold,” and Jean Reno (The Professional) will play an “unscrupulous French businessman who deals in nefarious activities in Vietnam.” This week, Da 5 Bloods gained Marvel’s Black Panther, as Chadwick Boseman has been cast to play the son&nbsp;of one of the “5 Bloods.” Although no other actors are officially cast yet, Lee has reportedly been talking to Don Cheadle, Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad), and his longtime frequent collaborator, Samuel L. Jackson.4. YESTERDAY TRAILER REVEALS MUSICAL’S SECRET WEAPON: THE BEATLES(Photo by Sony Pictures)Last March, we learned that Baby Driver and Downton Abbey star Lily James had landed the lead female role&nbsp;in a musical to be directed by Danny Boyle&nbsp;(Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting) with an unknown premise somehow connected to the 1960s or 1970s. It can be frustrating when a movie doesn’t reveal its premise, but you have to give Danny Boyle credit here for keeping Yesterday so well hidden for over a year. The trailer for Yesterday (6/28/2019) debuted online this week&nbsp;and revealed that relative newcomer Himesh Patel will be starring as a musician who wakes up in a world where the Beatles (seemingly) never existed, leading him to quickly become one of the world’s biggest pop stars. The other movies that Yesterday will be going up against on June 28th include the historical drama Ford v Ferrari, Tiffany Haddish’s Limited Partners, and the shark sequel 47 Meters Down: Uncaged.5. WITCHCRAFT UPDATE: WICKED&nbsp;IN 2021, OCTAVIA SPENCER IN&nbsp;THE WITCHESThe hit musical Wicked (based on The Wizard of Oz) debuted on Broadway in 2003, and was in development as a movie just a few years later. The project really started to move in 2013, which was the year that Oz the Great and Powerful came out, and at one point, it&nbsp;was&nbsp;scheduled for release in 2016, which is three years ago. Well, Universal Pictures is now scheduling Wicked for release&nbsp;on December 22, 2021, which is five days after Avatar 3 (yes, there’s already an Avatar 3 in the works). In related news, Robert Zemeckis is preparing to direct a remake of 1990’s The Witches (Fresh at 100%), based on the book by Roald Dahl. Anne Hathaway was recently cast in the role originally played by Anjelica Huston, and this week Octavia Spencer also signed on as the grandmother who has to help her grandson defeat the schemes of the titular Witches (10/16/2020).6.&nbsp;COMING TO AMERICA&nbsp;SEQUEL GETS A 2020 RELEASE DATEJust a couple of weeks ago, we reported that Eddie Murphy was set to return in a sequel to the hit 1988 comedy Coming to America. Paramount Pictures has now greenlit Coming to America 2 for release next summer on August 7, 2020. The premise of the sequel isn’t yet known, but Eddie Murphy will reprise his role as Akeem Joffer of the fictional African nation of Zamunda. It’s not yet known if other original cast members (most notably Arsenio Hall and James Earl Jones) might also return. Coming to America 2 was written by Black-ish creator Kenya Barris&nbsp;and will be directed by Craig Brewer (Hustle &amp; Flow, Black Snake Moan), who recently directed Eddie Murphy in the blaxploitation biopic My Name is Dolemite for Netflix.7.&nbsp;CHRIS PRATT JOINS SCI-FI MOVIE&nbsp;GHOST DRAFT(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)With filming of Avengers: Endgame now wrapped, many of Marvel’s stars are landing new jobs. This week alone, we see Thanos, Black Panther, Captain America, and Winter Soldier all getting new roles. Chris Pratt, who plays Guardians of the Galaxy “leader” Star-Lord, is now in negotiations for another science fiction action movie called Ghost Draft. Details about the premise are being mostly kept secret for now, but we do know&nbsp;what it’s about:&nbsp;a “husband and father is drafted to fight a future war in which the fate of humanity may rely on his ability to correct issues of the past.” From that, we can guess that some sort of time travel is involved (unless there’s some other way to “correct issues of the past”). Ghost Draft will be directed by Chris McKay (The LEGO Batman Movie), who is also developing Jonny Quest and Nightwing movies for Warner Bros.Rotten Ideas2. CHRIS EVANS JOINS INFINITE PAST LIVES SCI FI MOVIE(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Studios)Moving right along, another Marvel star in the news this week was Chris Evans (Captain America and, previously, Human Torch). Perhaps coincidentally, the movie Chris Evans is in talks for may bear some similarity to Chris Pratt’s Ghost Draft. Infinite (based on D. Eric Maikranz’s novel The Reincarnationist Papers) will tell the story of “a group of near-immortal men and women who are reincarnated over the centuries and known as ‘the Infinite.’ To defeat an evil mastermind who wants to destroy the planet, the group must rely on a man who suffers from schizophrenia and will have to learn that all his vivid dreams are actually memories from past lives, in order to defeat the villain.” Infinite will be directed by Antoine Fuqua, whose most recent film was the Denzel Washington sequel Equalizer 2 (51% Rotten). In (directly) related news, Sebastian Stan (AKA Captain America’s sidekick Bucky) will replace Chris Evans in the drama The Devil All the Time, now that Evans is likely to star in Infinite instead.1. BRYAN SINGER FALLOUT LEADS TO INDEFINITE DELAYS FOR RED SONJA(Photo by MGM courtesy Everett Collection)The Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody may have won a Golden Globe and&nbsp;earned multiple Academy Awards nominations, but the film’s director is effectively persona non grata. Last month, new allegations of sexual misconduct by director Bryan Singer (X-Men, Bohemian Rhapsody) were reported by The Atlantic. Soon after, Millennium Films confirmed that they were still developing&nbsp;a Red Sonja reboot with Singer directing, but just three weeks later, those plans are now “delayed,” with Millennium no longer selling the project at the European Film Market in Berlin. Singer hasn’t officially been fired (yet), but the high profile fantasy adventure&nbsp;cancelling&nbsp;filming in Bulgaria this spring certainly seems to point in that direction. Red Sonja was created by Marvel Comics in 1973 as a Conan the Barbarian spinoff character who quickly received her own popular solo comic book title (including later titles at other companies). Even without the allegations against Bryan Singer, some had called for a female director for Red Sonja, especially following the success of Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman. In (possibly) related news, Millennium Films is now preparing to make The Legend of Sinbad, a different fantasy adventure,&nbsp;with director Frank Coraci (who hasn’t helmed a Fresh movie since 1998’s The Wedding Singer).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"America, Annual, watch, YouTube, politics, Studios, travel, Network, Prime, San, news, satire, toronto, The","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/26221040/Aquaman-Social-Reactions-Rep.jpg","slug":"aquaman-is-getting-a-sequel-and-a-horror-spinoff-plus-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509179201828","title":"Yearly Ketchup: The Most Rotten Movie Development News of 2018","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Yearly Ketchup: The Most Rotten Movie Development News of 2018A month-by-month round-up of the worst news to come out of Hollywood this year.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 4, 2019 |  CommentsFew industries enjoy taking really, really long extended holiday vacations quite like Hollywood, and&nbsp;when we get to this time of the year, there’s rarely much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss. Last week, we reviewed 12 of the year’s top Fresh Developments, and this week, we’re looking at each month’s most Rotten Idea.JANUARY:&nbsp;JOHN CENA MIGHT STAR AS DUKE NUKEM(Photo by Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures)Video games continue to be the source of the most Rotten Tomatometer scores&nbsp;(presuming you don’t count video-game-adjacent titles like Wreck-It Ralph and Ready Player One). Regardless, Hollywood is still making lots of these movies, despite the relatively low box office on average. There were several news stories about such projects this year, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Monster Hunter, and Dance Dance Revolution. The project that stands out for 2018, though, is Duke Nukem, if only both because it is a project that’s been in development since the 1990s&nbsp;and because the source games don’t always gets great reviews either. In January, John Cena was reportedly talking to Michael Bay’s production company about starring as Duke Nukem. The involvement of Bay and Cena got a little murky recently, but the project is now also being produced by the people who delivered a&nbsp;Assassin’s Creed (Rotten at 17%), so Duke Nukem remains a dismal prospect.FEBRUARY:&nbsp;MICHAEL BAY MAY DIRECT DC’S BAD BOY&nbsp;LOBO(Photo by Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)The first Transformers film following Michael Bay’s departure as director was last week’s&nbsp;Bumblebee, which is currently enjoying a Certified Fresh 92% Tomatometer score. Instead, Bay is now turning his camera flares and limited color grading towards Warner Bros.’ DC Comics projects. In February, Bay started talking to&nbsp;WB about possibly directing their long-in-development Lobo movie, based on the “cosmic bad boy” character who’s sort of a cross between Marvel’s Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy. The film’s budget is currently reported&nbsp;as&nbsp;$200 million, so bringing that down will be one of the challenges Michael Bay will face.MARCH: CAPTAIN AMERICA CONFIRMS HE’S DONE AFTER AVENGERS: ENDGAME(Photo by Marvel Studios)When you follow movie development news, sometimes a story takes on a second life because not everyone picked up on it the first time around. This year, we saw that happen with a story reported not just for the second time, but a third time as well. You see, we first&nbsp;told you that Chris Evans was hanging up his Captain America shield way back in 2017. Then this year, in March, Chris Evans confirmed that with another announcement. Despite telling the world twice, it was Evans’ tweet in October that finally seemed to reach the widest audience. Even so, we expect that people are probably going to be surprised in April as well, when Evans departs as Captain America in Avengers: Endgame. Having said that, maybe he’s not really done with Marvel Comics, particularly with Fantastic Four likely to join the MCU in the 2020s. Is Michael Chiklis still available too?APRIL: LAWSUIT MIGHT MEAN WE NEVER GET ANOTHER TRIP DOWN FURY ROAD(Photo by Jasin Boland/Warner Bros.)Not every “Rotten Idea” is based on Tomatometer scores — some stories are Rotten because they mean movies with extremely Fresh potential might not happen. That’s absolutely what happened in April as we learned about a lawsuit that may jeopardize a fan favorite sequel. One of the most surprising films of 2015 was the sequel/reboot Mad Max: Fury Road, which won dozens of awards, including six of the ten Academy Awards it was nominated for. Though&nbsp;Mad Max: Fury Road was a triumph for its director, George Miller, he found himself&nbsp;engaged in what is being called a “bitter court battle” with Warner Bros. over what Miller’s production company claims is “high-handed, insulting, or reprehensible” behavior. The financial crux of Miller’s lawsuit involves what he says were promised bonuses for bringing Mad Max: Fury Road in under budget, and for “breaching a co-financing agreement.” Miller reportedly has had screenplays for both Mad Max 5 and Mad Max 6&nbsp;completed for years, but for now, he’s directing Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton in Three Thousand Years of Longing instead.MAY: TWO OF WILL SMITH’S ROTTEN FILMS GET POTENTIALLY ROTTEN SEQUELS(Photo by Columbia courtesy Everett Collection)This should surprise absolutely no one, but there isn’t always a clear correlation between Fresh Tomatometer scores and box office returns. Take, for example, Will Smith, who has over a dozen films that earned over $110 million domestically, but who also has only received two Fresh scores among his last 16&nbsp;films&nbsp;(with an average Tomatometer score of 13%, at that). This year, two of Smith’s Rotten films received sequels, including May’s confirmation that the long-in-development threequel Bad Boys for Life (a sequel to&nbsp;Bad Boys II, Rotten at 22%) is scheduled for January&nbsp;&nbsp; 17, 2020. The year also started with the January news that Netflix is developing a sequel to their fantasy action movie Bright (Rotten at 25%) .JUNE:&nbsp;LUCASFILM HAS A BAD FEELING ABOUT THE STAR WARS STORY PREQUELS(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Oh, how quickly things can change. On May 25th, the Top Story in The Weekly Ketchup was about Logan director James Mangold signing on with Lucasfilm for the prequel spinoff Boba Fett: A Star Wars Story. And then&nbsp;the box office numbers for Solo: A Star Wars Story continued to roll in&nbsp;— ouch! —&nbsp;and by June, we were running this story. That meant bad news not just for Boba Fett, but also previously discussed prequel spinoffs for characters like Obi-Wan and Yoda. Several months later, we can also now report that the prequel focus is shifting towards streaming, with Jon Favreau directing The Mandalorian for the upcoming Disney+ subscription service, which will be followed by a Rogue One spinoff series starring Diego Luna.JULY:&nbsp;DIRECTOR JAMES GUNN FIRED FROM&nbsp;GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 3(Photo by Marvel Studios)In July, the Marvel Cinematic Universe went all topsy-turvy when Walt Disney Pictures announced that they had “severed our business relationship” with director James Gunn, who delivered the first two Guardians of the Galaxy movies and had been developing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. The reason for Gunn’s dismissal was the re-discovery of several joke tweets from 2008 to 2011. In response, Gunn said in a statement that, “regardless of how much time has passed, I understand and accept the business decisions taken today.” Meanwhile,&nbsp; Gunn’s firing inspired a wide spectrum of responses, from this Collider editorial to Dave Bautista being “NOT ok” with it&nbsp;to Selma BLair saying Gunn is “one of the good ones” to this response calling for criminal prosecution. Eventually, in October, Marvel’s “Distinguished Competition” at Warner Bros. snapped up James Gunn to work on their Suicide Squad sequel.AUGUST: HOLLYWOOD TRIPLES DOWN ON NOSTALGIA(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. courtesy Everett Collection)Until recently, it seemed like maybe Hollywood was going to ease off its obsession with remakes a little bit, but what we saw simply might have been&nbsp;a respite as the trends moved on from the 1980s to the 1990s, as three such projects were announced all in one week. First of all, there was a project that is not a remake at all, but instead a prequel to the 1993 kids baseball movie The Sandlot&nbsp;(still, no less nostalgic). That original film’s writer and director, David Mickey Evans, made a deal with 20th Century Fox for a new movie that would delve deeper into the backstory of “The Beast,” the English mastiff that terrorized the original kids in 1962. The&nbsp;Sandlot prequel will actually be the fourth film in the franchise, as there were two direct-to-video sequels in 2005 and 2007. Paramount Players is also now developing a remake of the 1993 drama Indecent Proposal, about a young couple who agree to a&nbsp;arrangement in which the wife will spend one night with a wealthy man for $1 million. The remake is being written by screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson, who adapted 2016’s The Girl on the Train and is also working on Disney’s live-action remake of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Finally, Sony Pictures is also developing a remake of the 1987 Bruce Willis/Kim Basinger romantic comedy Blind Date.SEPTEMBER:&nbsp;YIPPEE-KI-YAY, THE&nbsp;DIE HARD ORIGIN MOVIE MOVES FORWARD(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Although 2007’s Live Free or Die Hard was Certified Fresh at 82%, when&nbsp;A Good Day to Die Hard came out six years later, the franchise took a steep dive at a Rotten 14%. That fifth Die Hard movie was a box office disappointment as well, earning the lowest totals of the franchise (especially when you adjust for inflation, ouch). Even so, 20th Century Fox is developing a sixth Die Hard movie, which will be a 1970s-set “origin story” for John McClane. Up until September, the prequel retained Die Hard in the title, as Die Hard: Year One, but we now know that Fox has decided to go in a different direction, as the film is now known as&nbsp;simply&nbsp;McClane. It’s not yet known which younger actor will be cast as the young John McClane.OCTOBER:&nbsp;LEBRON JAMES MIGHT REBOOT&nbsp;FRIDAY THE 13TH(Photo by Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures)Following big box office for October’s Halloween, another major slasher franchise also re-entered development for a reboot, although who might be producing it&nbsp;is arguably&nbsp;the bigger story. Basketball star LeBron James, who recently made the move from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Los Angeles Lakers, is using his new address to increase his film activity, and apparently, that might now also include producing&nbsp;Friday the 13th movies. James posted this image of himself in 2013 wearing a hockey mask, though he is not expected to be taking on the role as the new Jason Voorhees himself. The negotiations come just a month after original Friday the 13th screenwriter Victor Miller won a lawsuit against producer Sean Cunningham, although the rights are still described as “murky,” which is why the LeBron James news requires a big “might” or “may” in its language.NOVEMBER:&nbsp;GARFIELD IS COMING BACK(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)In 2004 and 2006, Bill Murray starred as the voice of the world’s most famous comic strip cat in Garfield: The Movie (Rotten at 15%) and Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties (Rotten at 11%). From one perspective, those low Tomatometer scores could mean that there’s “nowhere to go but up,” but as with video game movies, it’s probably more likely to mean that any future Garfield movies probably won’t be well received either. Those films also weren’t particularly successful financially either, with the first one only earning $75 million domestically from a budget of $50 million&nbsp;and the sequel barely making more than a third of that. Regardless, development is underway on a new animated adaptation of Jim Davis’ popular comic strip character. The challenging prospect of turning the Garfield ship around is being taken on by director Mark Dindal who is best known for Disney’s The Emperor’s New Groove (Certified Fresh at 85%) and Chicken Little (Rotten at 37%).DECEMBER: THE TOXIC AVENGER&nbsp;IS GETTING A BIG-BUDGET REBOOT(Photo by Troma Films)Although both 1984’s The Toxic Avenger and Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV received Fresh Tomatometer scores of 70%, the second film has an absolutely Rotten 0% and the third film wasn’t even reviewed enough to earn a score. The Toxic Avenger became such a cult fan favorite, though, that he became the company mascot of Troma Entertainment, the super low-budget production company behind such chestnuts as Blood Sucking Freaks, Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, and Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead. Despite its gonzo origins, The Toxic Avenger is now being developed as a new big-budget superhero franchise by Legendary Entertainment, the company behind The Dark Knight, Watchmen, and Godzilla. In addition to the four feature length movies, The Toxic Avenger was also adapted as&nbsp;“a stage musical production, a children’s cartoon TV series, and a Marvel comic.”","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Amazon, Prime, streaming, Nominations, Captain, Lifetime, service, Kemper, TV, in, Black, Walt, australia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/04113135/2018_Yearly_Ketchup_Rotten_Stories_Rep.jpg","slug":"yearly-ketchup-the-most-rotten-movie-development-news-of-2018"},{"id":"47509180940589","title":"Ridley Scott Moves Forward with Gladiator Sequel, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ridley Scott Moves Forward with Gladiator Sequel, and More Movie NewsIT's Andy Muschietti takes on two sci-fi adaptations, Madea and Boba Fett are kaput, and new roles for Ewan McGregor, Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, and Michael Keaton.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 2, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as&nbsp;Avengers 4, Gladiator 2, The Meg 2, and The Time Machine.This WEEK’S TOP STORYARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? RIDLEY SCOTT&nbsp;MOVES FORWARD WITH&nbsp;GLADIATOR&nbsp;SEQUEL(Photo by DreamWorks courtesy Everett Collection)Director Ridley Scott has had so many film projects in development&nbsp;over his career that they have their own Wikipedia page. (Some of those movies, like Alien 5, Blade Runner 2, Dune, I Am Legend, and Tristan &amp; Isolde&nbsp;were eventually directed by other filmmakers.) It’s anyone’s guess as to whether we will ever get&nbsp;The Merlin Saga, Monopoly, or The Prisoner, but one of the longest-running ideas still yet to be realized is a sequel to 2000’s Gladiator (which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe), and Scott is again considering directing a Gladiator sequel. The proposed sequel would tell the decades-later story of Lucius Verus, the son of Lucilla, and the nephew of the emperor Commodus (played in the first film, respectively, by Spencer Treat Clark, Connie Nielsen, and Joaquin Phoenix). DreamWorks no longer has the rights to a Gladiator sequel, so the project is now at Paramount, which, with Ridley Scott’s production company, has hired screenwriter Peter Craig (cowriter of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1/2, and 2020’s Top Gun: Maverick) to work on the sequel. There doesn’t appear to be much historical evidence of the real Lucius Verus becoming a gladiator, but Gladiator also suggested a detour from history anyway.Fresh Developments1. AVENGERS 4 CASTING IGNITES NEW RUMORS(Photo by Marvel Studios)Avengers 4 comes out in just six months from this Saturday (May 3, 2019), but there remains so much that we don’t know. Heck, we don’t even know the title yet. Marvel Studios is somehow sustaining that mystery even while they continue their second stage of production. This week, 13 Reasons Why co-star Katherine Langford was cast as “someone” in Avengers 4, with no clues about who that might be. That just means, however, that every fan who’s read actual comics can now speculate who Langford might play, and in today’s world, many of those fans are actual professional writers. One obvious reason for the mystery is that Langford’s character might hint at Marvel Studios’ future plans. A front runner guess (possibly because she has the same first name) is Kate Bishop, AKA Hawkeye, who takes over after (and during) Clint Barton’s era. Other possibilities include Clea (an ally of Doctor Strange), Queen Veranke (of the Skrulls from Captain Marvel), and longtime Avengers member Sersi (of The Eternals, who are someday getting their own movie). Meanwhile, Marvel Studios is developing shows for the upcoming Disney streaming app, which may include a team-up limited series starring Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). There has previously been talk about shows for Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) that are also “limited series” (probably 6 to 8 episodes), starting in 2019.2. EWAN MCGREGOR TO DON BLACK MASK AS BAT-VILLAIN IN BIRDS OF PREY(Photo by Neil Davidson/IFC Films courtesy Everett Collection)If we start the clock in 1989 with Tim Burton’s first Batman, there have been seven solo Batman movies in the modern era. Although we have obviously had three Jokers, two Two-Faces, and two Catwomans, for the most part the franchise focused on introducing new Bat-villains (the Spider-Man movies also tend to do this). Birds of Prey, featuring Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), is part of DC Comics’ extended “Bat-Family” of titles, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;will also feature a Batman-related villain. This time, it’s Black Mask‘s turn, and he will be played by Ewan McGregor, making his superhero movie debut. The Birds of Prey version of Black Mask is described as “a brutally sadistic kingpin in Gotham City’s criminal underworld who has a fixation with masks.” McGregor and Mary Elizabeth-Winstead previously co-starred together as a romantic couple dabbling in a life in crime in Fargo Season 3. You can read more about Black Mask’s road to the big screen right here. Warner Bros. has scheduled Birds of Prey for release on February 7, 2020, up against Peter Rabbit 2, and the week after the Shining sequel Doctor Sleep, also starring Ewan McGregor.3. IT DIRECTOR ADAPTING ATTACK ON TITAN AND THE TIME MACHINEIt is entirely expected that directors coming off two hit films like Mama and IT will be wanted for high profile films, but Andy Muschietti actually had that happen twice this week. First, on Monday, we learned that Muschietti had signed with Warner Bros. to direct their live action adaptation of the popular manga series Attack on Titan (which has also been adapted as an anime). Attack on Titan is set in a bizarre future in which mankind is beset by gigantic creatures called Titans who resemble humans (without their skin, so their muscles are exposed — it’s kind of gross). Warner Bros is also the studio behind next year’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters (5/31/2019) and Godzilla vs Kong (5/22/2020), so it makes total sense they’d also be interested in Attack on Titan. The second new project for Andy Muschietti this week is also at Warner Bros., with Leonardo DiCaprio’s Appian Way also on board. They have recruited Muschietti to start development on a new adaptation of H.G. Wells’ science fiction classic&nbsp;The Time Machine. The two most popular previous adaptations were released in 1960 (Fresh at 77%) and in 2002 (Rotten at 29%). It’s not yet known whether DiCaprio is considering starring&nbsp;in The Time Machine. Andy Muschietti wrapped filming of IT: Chapter Two this week for release next year on September 6, 2019.4. SACHA BARON COHEN, EDDIE REDMAYNE, AND THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7 &nbsp;(Photo by Focus Features)Up above, we&nbsp;mentioned director Ridley Scott has been attached to a lot of movies, but he’s got nothing on Steven Spielberg. Spielberg is now deeply in preproduction on his remake of West Side Story, and on Indiana Jones 5, but up until a few years ago, one of his projects was The Trial of the Chicago 7, depicting the true stories of the protestors at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Spielberg is still producing The Trial of the Chicago 7, but it will now be directed by its screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin (Molly’s Game). Sacha Baron Cohen (who nearly starred as Freddie Mercury in this week’s Bohemian Rhapsody) is also in early talks to play one of the protest’s leaders, Abbie Hoffman (of the “Yippies”). That news would have been a lot for one week, but Eddie Redmayne is also now in talks to play Tom Hayden, one of the student leaders (and future husband of Jane Fonda).5.&nbsp;MICHAEL KEATON TO PLAY ANTI-VIRUS ICON JOHN MCAFEE IN KING OF THE JUNGLE(Photo by The Weinstein Company)Many corporate leaders and innovators lead pretty boring lives, but then there’s John McAfee, who lent his surname to the popular line of McAfee antivirus software.&nbsp; John McAfee is back in the United States now, but for several years, he was on the run in Central America after accusations in 2012 that he had been involved in a murder in Belize. This incredible true story will soon become a movie called King of the Jungle, and we now know who will be the film’s two male stars. Michael Keaton will play McAfee, and Seth Rogen will pay a journalist who finds himself drawn into “McAfee’s escalating paranoia, slippery reality, and murder.” King of the Jungle will be directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (the co-directors of Crazy Stupid Love) from a screenplay by the writing team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (Ed Wood, Man on the Moon). Michael Keaton comes to King of the Jungle after the departure of the film’s first announced star, Johnny Depp.6. CHRIS ROCK TO DIRECT&nbsp;KEVIN HART IN&nbsp;CO-PARENTING(Photo by Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images)Since making his directorial debut in 2003 with the political comedy Head of State, comedian Chris Rock has also directed 2007’s I Think I Love My Wife and 2014’s Top Five. Rock also starred in all three of those films, but for his fourth film as director, he has instead recruited Kevin Hart as his lead. Kevin Hart will star in Co-Parenting, a family comedy from screenwriter Yamara Taylor (TV’s black-ish), playing “a stay at home dad who raises the kids while his star CEO wife serves as the breadwinner… [until he] finds himself in emotional and public turmoil when his wife kicks him to the curb, and they engage in a bitter divorce and custody battle.” So, perhaps it’s not all comedy (the tone is being compared to some of the films of Judd Apatow and James L. Brooks).7. TYLER PERRY ANNOUNCES 2019 TO BE THE END OF MADEA(Photo by Lionsgate)Every once in a while, we interpret a news story as a “Fresh Development” because it involves a turnaround for something that would otherwise be “Rotten.” For example, Tyler Perry may have had a great box office run with his Madea character, but no movie with Madea in the title has ever scored above a 37% on the Tomatometer (that was 2011’s Madea’s Big Happy Family). So, when Tyler Perry announced this week that 2019 would be the end of the Madea character with Tyler Perry’s A Madea Family Funeral (3/1/2019), we see&nbsp;it as a “Fresh Development” for actual moviegoers. The 10 movies in Tyler Perry’s Madea franchise have earned over $500 million to date.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. THE BOBA FETT SPINOFF IS OFFICALLY DEAD(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Back in June, following the (relatively) disappointing box office numbers for Solo: A Star Wars Story, the world started hearing talk that Lucasfilm might be reconsidering its collective plans for “Star Wars Story” spinoffs. At that point, there had been discussions about spinoffs for such characters as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and the bounty hunter Boba Fett (and indeed, that might’ve been next up). Well, this week, we received confirmation that the project that might’ve been called Boba Fett: A Star Wars Story is no longer being developed, with the focus instead going to Jon Favreau’s series The Mandalorian for Disney’s upcoming streaming service. (Boba Fett wears Mandalorian battle armor.) As for what the Boba Fett spinoff would have included, we also learned this week that several of Boba Fett’s fellow bounty hunters would have been featured in the movie, potentially including characters such as IG-88, Bossk, Dengar, 4-Lom, and Zuckus. As this piece points out, however, fans have been fascinated by Boba Fett for 40 years now, so we may yet see Boba Fett return in some form yet, somewhere, someday.1. THE MEG SEQUEL STILL IN DEVELOPMENT(Photo by Warner Bros.)This summer saw the release of the giant shark movie The Meg after the project had been kicked around Hollywood for about 20 years of development. The Meg received a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 46%, but it was still a box office success, earning $142 million domestically and over $527 million globally. One of the changes that was made to&nbsp;the film&nbsp;through the course of its development was a focus on Asian settings, characters, and financing, which was surely part of why the film did so well in many overseas markets. That’s probably also why a sequel to The Meg is now in development, as its executive producer Catherine Xujin Ying revealed this week. It’s not yet known if Jason Statham or any other co-stars will return for the sequel. In addition to a sequel and a potential film franchise, The Meg may also soon inspire giant-shark theme parks around the world. There’s no word yet as to when&nbsp;The Meg 2 might take its giant bite out of the box office (or not).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Video, Stephen, The, USA, Tomatazos, Pirates, Fantasy, winner, rings, Dark, political, Dates, Podcast","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/02121120/Gladiator-Ketchup-Rep.jpg","slug":"ridley-scott-moves-forward-with-gladiator-sequel-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509180941614","title":"LeBron James Might Reboot Friday the 13th, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})LeBron James Might Reboot Friday the 13th, and More Movie NewsGuillermo del Toro does Pinocchio, DiCaprio and Scorsese reunite, Clueless gets remade, George Miller recruits Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton, and Wonder Woman is delayed.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 26, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as The Boy 2, Clueless, and Wonder Woman 1984, and new roles for Leonardo DiCaprio and Chris Pratt.This WEEK’S TOP STORYLEBRON JAMES MIGHT REBOOT&nbsp;FRIDAY THE 13TH(Photo by Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)Last weekend, Halloween drew in $77.5 million in its opening weekend for the #2 October weekend of all time, just $3 million behind Venom, which broke that record just a few weeks earlier. It was probably an easy guess that Halloween would do well, but its $77.5 million opening weekend broke records. Unsurprisingly, another major slasher franchise might now be in development for a reboot, although who might be producing the Friday the 13th reboot is arguably the bigger story. Basketball star LeBron James, who moved from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Los Angeles Lakers this year, is also using his new address to increase his film activity, and apparently, that might also include producing Friday the 13th movies, as he posted this image of himself in 2013 wearing a hockey mask. The negotiations come just a month after original Friday the 13th screenwriter Victor Miller won a lawsuit against producer Sean Cunningham, although the rights are still described as “murky,” which is why the LeBron James news isn’t definitive by any means. In related news, Halloween star Jamie Lee Curtis this week also joined the murder mystery Knives Out (joining Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Michael Shannon) for Star Wars: The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson.Fresh Developments1. NETFLIX&nbsp;TO PRODUCE GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S PINOCCHIO(Photo by Kerry Hayes/Universal Pictures)Hollywood creatives frequently compete with each other to get similar projects off the ground. One such example over the past ten years has been “a new Pinocchio.” Robert Downey Jr. was long attached to star in a live action Pinocchio at Warner Bros., and Disney also has&nbsp;a live-action remake&nbsp;of their 1940 animated classic. The third major Pinocchio revival that’s been long planned is from director Guillermo del Toro (The Shape of Water, Pan’s Labyrinth), except that his film is a stop-motion animated musical, and not live action. In addition to his new producing deal at Fox Searchlight, del Toro also has a deal at Netflix (for Trollhunters and the upcoming 10 After Midnight). That relationship is continuing with the Pinocchio stop-motion animated musical, which is now set up at Netflix (with The Jim Henson Company also co-producing). Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, which will begin production soon at ShadowMachine (Bojack Horseman), will be set in Italy in the 1930s during the time of fascist rule under Benito Mussolini. In related news, Roberto Benigni, who starred in a 2002 Pinocchio, will next play Geppetto in a new Italian version of Pinocchio.2. IDRIS ELBA AND TILDA SWINTON JOIN FANTASY EPIC FROM MAD MAX&nbsp;DIRECTOR(Photo by Jason Smith, Derek Storm/Everett Collection)Director George Miller is still involved in a lawsuit with Warner Bros. over Mad Max: Fury Road, so we may not see another Mad Max film anytime soon (from him anyway). Instead, Miller is moving on to other projects, including a “fantasy epic” called Three Thousand Years of Longing. George Miller will direct from his own screenplay, but the actual premise is being kept secret for now, except that it’s reportedly “unlike anything the filmmaker has done before.” In other words, it’s not likely to be a post-apocalyptic road movie or a kids movie with talking animals (Babe, Happy Feet). The same day we first heard of Three Thousand Years of Longing, the news broke quickly that both Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton were already attached to to star in the film, now also described as a “romance” involving a genie. Filming of Three Thousand Years of Longing is expected to start in early 2019.3.&nbsp;LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO MAKE SIXTH FILM WITH MARTIN SCORSESE(Photo by Mary Cybulski/Paramount Pictures)Robert De Niro famously starred in eight films for director Martin Scorsese (including Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas), which still stands as one of the most prolific actor/director collaboration runs in relatively modern memory. Leonardo DiCaprio is closing in on De Niro’s record, however, having starred in five films for Scorsese (Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed, Shutter Island, and The Wolf of Wall Street) and confirmed for a sixth. Having finished The Irishman for Netflix, Martin Scorsese is now confirmed to next direct an adaptation of the bestselling nonfiction book Killers of the Flower Moon by author David Grann. As the title suggests, Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI tells the early 1920s true crime story of the investigation of a series of murders in Oklahoma oil country. Leonardo DiCaprio is likely going to play one of the FBI agents. Early rumors suggested that Robert De Niro might also co-star in Killers of the Flower Moon, but his name wasn’t mentioned in this week’s announcement.4. YOU KNOW IT AIN’T EASY: THE EPIC LOVE STORY OF JOHN LENNON AND YOKO ONOUniversal Pictures is now negotiating to acquire the required rights for an untitled “drama about the epic love story between John Lennon and Yoko Ono,” with Jean-Marc Vallée (Dallas Buyers Club, The Young Victoria) attached to direct and edit. The deal should be made easier by the fact that Yoko Ono herself is one of the project’s producers (since, as Lennon’s widow, she also has the rights to his legacy). There have been a few films about the early days of The Beatles (namely Backbeat and Nowhere Boy), but the idea of a major motion picture about the Beatles during the height of their careers has remained something of an unrealized “golden goose.” In somewhat related news, director Richard Linklater also revealed this week that he is working on a biopic&nbsp;about influential standup comedian Bill Hicks.5.&nbsp;CHRIS PRATT FINDS NEW MOVIE TO MAKE UP FOR COWBOY NINJA VIKING AND GOTG3 DELAYS(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)August was a rough month for Chris Pratt’s potential box office for 2019 and 2020, as his next two big budget projects were both delayed from imminent production start dates. In late July, director James Gunn was fired by Disney from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 (which had been expected to be a 2020 release) over Tweets he made before his original hiring by Disney. And then in early August, Universal Pictures “indefinitely delayed” Pratt’s Cowboy Ninja Viking, which had been scheduled for release on June 28, 2019. It may take some time for Pratt to find a comparable high profile film, but he does have at least one movie to work on now, as he is now in talks to star in a crime action/drama with the working title of Fast for writer director Taylor Sheridan. Sheridan directed last year’s Wind River, and as screenwriter has worked on Hell or High Water, Sicario, and its sequel Sicario: Day of the Soldado. Fast&nbsp;is a $70-$80 million project for Warner Bros.&nbsp;about “a former special forces commando (Pratt) who’s recruited by the DEA to lead a black ops strike team targeting drug dealers who are protected by the CIA.”6. DISNEY HIRES ARRR-RATED DEADPOOL WRITERS FOR PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN REBOOT(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Last year, the $172 million domestic box office for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales made the fifth film in the series the lowest grossing, continuing a spiraling decline that started with 2011’s Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. That doesn’t necessarily mean, as it turns out, that Disney has given up on the PotC franchise, but it does seem like if it comes back, it will be a fresh reboot, because Disney is considering hiring screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick about rebooting Pirates of the Caribbean. We can guess a lot about what such a reboot could be, based on Reese and Wernick’s previous work, which has included both Zombieland (zombies being a common thread in the PotC franchise), and Deadpool (which was R-rated and snarky). Even though it’s called a “reboot,” the possibility of Johnny Depp or others returning is apparently not being ruled out. In related news, Johnny Depp’s name came up in two other stories this week, first for Waiting for the Barbarians (from Embrace of the Serpent director Ciro Guerra) and then for Minamata, a biopic about war photographer W. Eugene Smith.7. REMAKES OF CLUELESS AND ITS SOURCE EMMA BOTH IN THE WORKS(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)In 1996, a new movie adapting Jane Austen’s Emma was released (starring Gwyneth Paltrow). Just a year earlier, in 1995, another adaptation of Emma had been a huge hit, but most people know that film, Clueless, more for its 1990s-era slang and Alicia Silverstone’s career-defining performance than its Emma provenance. On Thursday afternoon, the news came out that Paramount Pictures has begun early development of a remake of Clueless, with Girls Trip writer Tracy Oliver producing and GLOW writer Marquita Robinson working on the screenplay. In a bizarre coincidence of timing, just&nbsp;24 minutes later&nbsp;it was reported that&nbsp;Anya Taylor-Joy (of The Witch, Split, and next year’s The New Mutants) has been cast in a remake of Emma by the British production company Working Title. The casting of Taylor-Joy suggests that Emma is probably much closer to getting made than the Clueless remake, so the actual films might be released at least a few years apart, but for one Thursday in late October, they made the news within the same hour.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. WONDER WOMAN 1984 DELAYED TO 2020, IMPACTING CHARLIE’S ANGELS, TERMINATOR, AND THE SIX BILLION DOLLAR MAN(Photo by Warner Bros.)For a while, it looked like there would be four movies in 2019 based on DC Comics titles (Shazam! on 4/5/2019, The Kitchen on 9/20/2019, and Joker on 10/4/2019), but this week, the highest profile of them was moved on the summer of 2020. Gal Gadot took to Twitter to announce that Wonder Woman 1984 has moved back seven months from its previous date of November 1, 2019 to June 5, 2020 (a week after the Disney sequel Maleficent II). Wonder Woman 1984 took that date away from Mark Wahlberg’s The Six Billion Dollar Man, which Warner Bros. took off its schedule following the departure of its director in May. In response to the vacuum left behind by Wonder Woman 1984, two separate reboots moved to that date instead: Charlie’s Angels (pushed back six weeks from 9/27/2019) and Terminator (pushed up two weeks from 11/15/2019). The Certified Fresh 93% Tomatometer for the first Wonder Woman makes this seven-month delay a “Rotten Idea.”1. KATIE HOLMES SIGNS ON FOR SEQUEL TO HORROR MOVIE THE BOY(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)The 2016 supernatural horror film The Boy didn’t make a ton of money, but its $35 million domestic take was a success, based on its relatively minimal $10 million budget. That unfortunately means that, 28% Tomatometer score aside, a sequel to The Boy probably makes bottom line sense for STXfilms. The biggest surprise is probably that, for the sequel, STX has been able to attract a bigger star (than the first film’s Lauren Cohan) in the form of Katie Holmes. Filming is expected to start on The Boy 2 in British Columbia on January 14th, 2019. No release date has been announced yet, but we can probably expect&nbsp;it&nbsp;in early 2020 (most likely), or if it’s really rushed, maybe in time for the Halloween season of late 2019.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"movies, Office, TV, mission:, jamie, Month, drama, biography, spain","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/26155705/Friday-13th-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"lebron-james-might-reboot-friday-the-13th-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509180950834","title":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell Join Birds of Prey, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell Join Birds of Prey, and More Movie NewsHappy Death Day gets a sequel, Joaquin Phoenix goes full clown, Train to Busan and The Wild Bunch get remakes, and Bruce Dern fills a gap.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 28, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Birds of Prey, Happy Death Day 2U, Kingsman 3, and Monster Hunter.This WEEK’S TOP STORYMARGOT ROBBIE’S BIRDS OF PREY TEAMMATES CAST(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Last week, the news broke that Warner Bros. was testing various actresses for the three characters that would be joining Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn in their adaptation of DC Comics’ Birds of Prey. A sense of urgency was implied, with the roles expected to be cast by the end of September (ie, this weekend), so that the actresses could begin training in time for filming to start in January. Well, that’s exactly what happened, as Warner Bros. has cast Mary Elizabeth Winstead (10 Cloverfield Lane, Scott Pilgrim vs the World) and former child star Jurnee Smollett-Bell (Eve’s Bayou, TV’s Friday Night Lights) as Huntress and Black Canary, respectively. Birds of Prey will be directed by Cathy Yan, who landed the job on the strength of Dead Pigs (Fresh at 100%). The fourth lead role yet to be cast is Detective Renee Montoya, but as her character is more “gun based” and less kicky/punchy, the training requirements might not be the same as with Huntress and Black Canary. We also learned this week that Warner Bros. has scheduled Birds of Prey for release&nbsp;on February 7, 2020, which puts it up against Peter Rabbit 2, and the weekend before James Bond 25 and Reese Witherspoon’s Legally Blonde 3. Warner Bros. reportedly decided to go with Birds of Prey following a pitch from Margot Robbie for “the idea of an R-rated girl gang film including Harley, because I was like, ‘Harley needs friends.’” You can learn more about the comic book histories of both Black Canary and Huntress in this piece, read Winstead’s own take on Huntress here, and see some of the wildly divergent social media reactions here.Fresh Developments1. BRUCE DERN REPLACING THE LATE BURT REYNOLDS IN TARANTINO’S NEXT MOVIE(Photo by The Weinstein Company)It was a little over a year ago that we first heard that Quentin Tarantino’s ninth film as director would be an ensemble drama set in Los Angeles in the summer of 1969 with the Manson Family murders as a narrative backdrop. That film is now titled Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (and scheduled for July 26, 2019). After Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt were cast as the two leads, one of the earliest casting announcements was the late Burt Reynolds as 80-year-old George Spahn,&nbsp;who allowed Charles Manson and his followers to live at the “Spahn Ranch.” Although Tarantino had started filming when Burt Reynolds died on September 6, Reynolds had not yet filmed his scenes, but the director&nbsp;has found a replacement for the George Spahn role in 82-year-old Bruce Dern, a longtime friend of Burt Reynolds who had worked with him on TV projects like Hard Round, Hard Time: The Premonition, and the TV series 12 O’Clock High. Dern has also previously worked with Quentin Tarantino on both Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight.2. TESSA THOMPSON’S VALKYRIE POSSIBLY RETURNING IN&nbsp;AVENGERS 4(Photo by Marvel Studios)Though it’s perhaps not immediately obvious,&nbsp;there is a fairly major element missing between Thor: Ragnarok and&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War. Ragnarok ends with Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie on board the Asgardians’ ship,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Infinity War begins with that same ship assailed by Thanos’ forces. So, where was Valkyrie? Avengers: Infinity War never directly addresses that, but this week, we learned that Thompson is apparently now filming scenes for Avengers 4 during the film’s second phase of production&nbsp;in Atlanta. Both she and Chris Hemsworth were in London at the beginning of the week for filming of the Men in Black spinoff (6/14/2019), in which they both co-star, and then they were both seen flying to Atlanta. Of course, there are other possibilities, such as Thompson just accompanying Hemsworth to Avengers 4 as a friend. Valkyrie’s absense from Avengers: Infinity War (along with Hawkeye and Ant-Man), however, suggests a mystery available for Avengers 4 to address when it’s released on May 3rd, 2019.3.&nbsp;SETH ROGEN FOLLOWS&nbsp;SAUSAGE PARTY WITH PICKLING COMEDY(Photo by Glen Wilson/Universal Pictures)Seth Rogen has two new movies scheduled for the summer of 2019: the comedy Flarsky with Charlize Theron (6/7/2019), and Disney’s remake of The Lion King (in which Rogen plays Pumbaa the warthog) (7/19/2019). Outside James Franco’s The Disaster Artist (for A24) and Netflix’s Like Father, the last time Seth Rogen starred in a comedy from a major studio was 2016’s Sausage Party. That R-rated animated comedy was distributed by Sony Pictures, and that studio is reuniting with Rogen for another food-themed project. Seth Rogen is attached to star in an untitled “high concept” comedy about an immigrant to America who lands a job at a pickle factory in 1918, only to fall into the brine and become preserved for 100 years. Rogen will play both the pickled survivor, and his great grandson, a “mild-mannered computer coder.” The screenplay is adapted from a novella originally published by The New Yorker, which you can read starting here, followed by parts two, three, and its conclusion. This movie will be the directorial debut of frequent Seth Rogen cinematographer Brandon Trost (Neighbors, This is the End, The Interview).4. HAPPY DEATH DAY 2U SEQUEL TITLE ANNOUNCED(Photo by Universal Studios)Last year’s Happy Death Day was enough of a surprisingly effective horror take on Groundhog Day that it earned a&nbsp;Tomatometer score of 70%. We’ve known for a while that Universal Pictures was moving quickly to produce a sequel for next Valentine’s Day (against X-Men: Dark Phoenix, and the week after The LEGO Movie 2 and the sequel/reboot What Men Want). The cleverness inherent to Happy Death Day suggested that the producers might have fun with the sequel’s title, and this week, those speculations were justified. The film is now officially titled Happy Death Day 2U, which brings to mind both Internet lingo and Prince-style song titles. Jessica Rothe will return as the lead character in Happy Death Day 2U, along with several new cast members you can see listed here.&nbsp;Happy Death Day earned over $122 million globally from a production budget of just $4.8 million, and the sequel is expected to have been produced on a similarly low budget.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK5.&nbsp;JOAQUIN PHOENIX IS GOING “FULL CLOWN” IN&nbsp;JOKER(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although Batman’s long-standing archenemy the Joker is famously known as the “Clown Prince of Crime,” that expression has always stood somewhat separate from the visual shorthand we associate with “clowns.” Yes, the Joker has white skin (or wears white clown makeup) and green hair and dresses colorfully, but his usual garb otherwise is not really a “clown costume.” That distinction has become increasingly obvious the last week or so as we’ve seen what Joaquin Phoenix looks like&nbsp;in next year’s Joker origin movie (10/4/2019). It started last Friday with a leaked “test footage” video, but the idea of&nbsp;Phoenix&nbsp;going “full clown” was driven home by an image of&nbsp;him in a clown costume, complete with green “Bozo”-style hair, oversized shoes, a red rubber nose, and a funny little hat. (Director Todd Phillips also revealed our first look at Deadpool 2 costar Zazie Beetz in character, but it’s a less revelatory image.) We also now have video footage of Joaquin Phoenix in character filming a subway action sequence, and in that scene, he more closely resembles Heath Ledger’s take on Joker, but it’s still more “clown” and less “prince of crime.” Also this week, the writers of the other upcoming Joker (and Harley Quinn) movie (starring Jared Leto and Margot Robbie) addressed their film’s tone.4. CONJURING&nbsp;PRODUCER REMAKING KOREA’S ZOMBIE THRILLER&nbsp;TRAIN TO BUSAN(Photo by Well Go USA Entertainment)Train to Busan was a 2016 Korean horror-thriller set on a commuter passenger train during a zombie apocalypse that takes place in the surrounding countryside.&nbsp;The film is Certified Fresh at 96%&nbsp;and was the recipient of dozens of international and festival film awards. Train to Busan works well because, like previous films like Terror Train&nbsp;and Snowpiercer, the narrow geography of a locomotive lends itself to claustrophobia and tension. Producer and director James Wan first made his mark with the Saw franchise before moving on to Insidious, The Conjuring, and the action movies Furious 7 and this year’s Aquaman. Wan and his Atomic Monster production company are now developing a remake of Train to Busan for New Line Cinema to be written by Gary Dauberman, the writer of Annabelle&nbsp;(Rotten at 29%) and this month’s The Nun&nbsp;(Rotten at 27%). It’s not yet known who will direct the Train to Busan remake.3. SPY SEQUEL KINGSMAN 3 TAKES RELEASE DATE LEFT VACANT BY JAMES BOND 25(Photo by Giles Keyte/20th Century Fox)About a month after director Danny Boyle’s departure from James Bond 25, we learned last week that the film is now scheduled for February 14, 2020, which was a move back of about three months from its original release date of November 9, 2019. Someone at 20th Century Fox was clearly paying attention, because the studio has now scheduled its own “glamorized spy franchise” entry for that same date in the form of Kingsman 3. The first film,&nbsp;Kingsman: The Secret Service (Certified Fresh at 74%), came out in 2015&nbsp;and was followed just last year by the sequel Kingsman: The Golden Circle (Rotten at 53%), so these movies are coming out in brisk two-year intervals. Director Matthew Vaughn is signed to both write and direct this third film, but there are not yet any other details known, except that it promises to depict&nbsp;“the conclusion of the Harry Hart-Eggsy relationship.”2. MEL GIBSON REMAKING CLASSIC WESTERN THE WILD BUNCH(Photo by Claire Folger/Paramount Pictures)Following a DUI arrest in 2006 and other controversies in following years, actor-turned-director Mel Gibson went ten years in between 2006’s Apocalypto and 2016’s Hacksaw Ridge without directing a film. Although it had a $40 million budget, and was released in the USA by Summit Entertainment, Hacksaw Ridge was, for the most part, an independent production (at least in terms of the “major studios”). Mel Gibson came a little closer to being back in Hollywood’s good graces as a director this week, with the news that he is now attached to write, direct, and executive produce a major remake for Warner Bros., namely&nbsp;Sam Peckinpah’s 1969 classic western The Wild Bunch. That film told the story of a group of aging former bandits and outlaws who unite for one last big score in Mexico, leading to an ill-fated showdown involving a gatling gun and dozens of enemies. It’s not yet known if Gibson’s&nbsp;version&nbsp;will be a direct remake, or something more like a new story “inspired by” Peckinpah’s original film. It’s also not known if&nbsp;he will take on one of the roles. The Wild Bunch now joins another project that Mel Gibson is developing, a World War II drama called Destroyer in which his Daddy’s Home 2 co-star Mark Wahlberg is attached to star.1. HELLBOY STAR RON PERLMAN JOINS MILLA JOVOVICH IN MONSTER HUNTER(Photo by Universal Pictures)2017’s Resident Evil: The Final Chapter ended the six-film run on the franchise starring Milla Jovovich and directed by her husband Paul W.S. Anderson. That the final film’s 37% Tomatometer score was the highest of the six says a lot about both the quality of the&nbsp;Resident Evil movies and the critical state of video game adaptations as a larger trend. Jovovich and Anderson aren’t quite done with video game movies, however, as they are currently preparing next to adapt the Monster Hunter franchise. Monster Hunter made the news twice this week, starting first with the addition of both Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Pacific Rim) and rapper-turned-actor T.I. Harris (Takers, Get Hard). T.I. will play a sniper, and Perlman will play “Admiral, the leader of the Hunter’s Crew.” The second casting story this week involved Thai martial arts star Tony Jaa of the Ong-Bak franchise. Monster Hunter is scheduled to start filming in South Africa in October on a budget of $60 million. In somewhat related news, the Hellboy reboot (with Stranger Things star David Harbour replacing Ron Perlman) has been pushed back three months&nbsp;from January 11, 2019 to April 12, 2019 (up against Robert Downey Jr’s The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"language, Esquire, Channel, Signature, black, Diego, Plus, Tomatazos, historical, kaiju, rings, vampires, bond, Teen","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/28120020/Winstead-Jurnee-Birds-of-Prey-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"mary-elizabeth-winstead-jurnee-smollett-bell-join-birds-of-prey-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509179221287","title":"Doctor Strange Sequel Slated for Potential 2021 Release, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Doctor Strange Sequel Slated for Potential 2021 Release, and More Movie NewsChris Pratt and Tom Holland join Pixar's Onward, Lea Seydoux returns to Bond, and Plastic Man, The Toxic Avenger, and Duke Nukem get new movies.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 15, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Duke Nukem, Plastic Man, The Toxic Avenger, and Pixar’s Onward.This WEEK’S TOP STORYDOCTOR STRANGE&nbsp;SEQUEL CASTS SPELL FOR POTENTIAL&nbsp;2021 RELEASERyan FujitaniWhen Marvel’s Doctor Strange was released in 2016, it didn’t feature any hosts of Hoggoth (hoary or otherwise), but that spell and dozens of other franchise elements remain out there for a sequel. This has been a big year for new Marvel Studios projects going into development for 2021 and beyond, including Black Widow, The Eternals, Ms. Marvel, Black Panther 2, and most recently, Shang-Chi. In the first three phases, there was a balance between original films and sequels, but as you can see from those five films, the focus in 2018 has thus far been on new properties, with Black Panther 2 being the only direct sequel. A Doctor Strange&nbsp;sequel was conspicuously absent, but that changed this week&nbsp;as director Scott Derrickson was confirmed to return for a second installment. Benedict Cumberbatch and Benedict Wong are both signed to return, and Rachel McAdams is expected to as well. Filming of Doctor Strange 2 is expected to start in early 2020, possibly aiming for a release in early May (or late April) of 2021. As for what Doctor Strange 2 might introduce to the Marvel Cinematic Universe next, there are lots of possibilities (though it probably involves either Baron Mordo or Nightmare, or both).Fresh Developments1. MARVEL’S STAR-LORD AND SPIDER-MAN MOVE&nbsp;ONWARD FOR PIXAR IN 2020(Photo by Todd Williamson/Getty Images)Pixar introduced the first teasers for next summer’s Toy Story 4 a few weeks back, but we were still lacking details about another film scheduled for 2020, including&nbsp;its title. Pixar corrected that this week with the revelation that the “suburban fantasy” will be called Onward, will be directed by Dan Scanlon (Monsters University), and feature the voices of Chris Pratt, Tom Holland, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Octavia Spencer. Pratt and Holland are both Marvel Studios stars (Star-Lord and Spider-Man, respectively), and Octavia Spencer will co-star in Robert Downey’ Jr’s The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle, also in 2020 (1/17/2020). Although Onward is described as a “suburban fantasy,” it remains unclear what that means exactly.&nbsp;Onward is scheduled for release on March 6, 2020, which puts it a week after Fantasy Island (2/28/2020) and a week before the X-Men spinoff Gambit, starring Channing Tatum (3/13/2020). In related news, the first trailer for Tom Holland’s next solo Marvel movie, Spider-Man: Far From Home (7/5/2019) debuted in Brazil this week.2. LEA SEYDOUX TO MAKE RARE RETURN FOR JAMES BOND 25(Photo by Jonathan Olley/Columbia Pictures)One of the elements that unites almost all “Bond girls” to date is that the characters almost never return for a second film (although some like Maud Adams have played different characters). French actress Lea Seydoux, who co-starred in Spectre as Madeleine Swann, is going to buck the trend, however, as she will reprise her character&nbsp;in the 25th James Bond film. Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek was reportedly considered for the film’s villain, but conflicts with the filming of his TV series Mr. Robot are likely preventing him from being cast. Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation, Sin Nombre) will be directing Daniel Craig in his fifth film as James Bond when it’s released on February 14th, Valentine’s Day, in 2020.3. GOT’s KING TOMMEN INHERITS PRIME 2019&nbsp;RELEASE DATE FOR 1917(Photo by Gregorio T. Binuya/Everett Collection)Dozens of actors were featured in Game of Thrones, and next year, we’re going to start to really see a deluge of new projects for them, as the show’s final season has finished principal production. Obviously, some of them have already been taking work in between seasons,&nbsp;particularly those who left the show before season 7. One such young actor is Dean-Charles Chapman, who is not (yet) a household name, but is known to fans as King Tommen Baratheon in seasons 4, 5 and 6. Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners have teamed up on a film called 1917, starring Chapman and George MacKay (Captain Fantastic). 1917 is the next film of director Sam Mendes, whose record behind the camera on the Tomatometer is entirely Fresh, including Certified Fresh scores for American Beauty and Skyfall. 1917’s title refers to the fourth year of World War I, the year in which the United States entered the war (4/6/1917). That McKay and Chapman are both English actors, however, suggests a British perspective. 1917 will open in limited released on December 25, 2019 (against Call of the Wild, Little Women, and Super Intelligence), and then expand wide on January 10, 2020.4. LIGHTER, BRIGHTER DC COMICS MOVIES LEADS TO BOUNCY SUPERHERO PLASTIC MAN(Photo by DC Comics)What a difference ten years can make. In 2008, director and producer Zack Snyder (Justice League, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice) chided his Marvel competition, saying, “we’re going to have a Captain America movie if we’re not careful.” The positive reviews for the brighter perspectives of Wonder Woman (Certified Fresh at 93%), Teen Titans Go! to the Movies (Certified Fresh at 91%), and Aquaman (currently Fresh at 72%) suggest that critics and audiences alike want superhero movies that aren’t always so grim (the verdict is still out on whether that would work for a Batman movie, of course). This week, DC Comics revealed plans for the hero who might be the lightest yet (even more so than next year’s Shazam!), namely the super stretchy shapeshifter Plastic Man. First introduced in 1941, Plastic Man also had his own Saturday morning cartoon from 1979 to 1981. (Some sources are also comparing Plastic Man to Deadpool.) Although the Wachowskis (The Matrix, Speed Racer) had at one time been developing their own Plastic Man (the screenplay of which read a bit like a take on The Mask), the new Plastic Man will be written by newcomer Amanda Idoko (who also wrote the upcoming Breaking News In Yuba County, starring Laura Dern and Allison Janney).5. GRUESOME VILLAIN MR. ZSASZ JOINS MARGOT ROBBIE’S BIRDS OF PREYLast month, we learned that Ewan McGregor had been cast as the villain Black Mask in the lengthily titled Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn). That will be Margot Robbie’s second film as Harley Quinn, and her other teammates will include Mary Elizabeth Winstead (10 Cloverfield Lane) as Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary, and Rosie Perez as Detective Renee Montoya. This week, we learned that Black Mask won’t be the only villain in BoP (&amp;TFEOOHQ), as Chris Messina (TV’s The Mindy Project) has also been cast as the insane killer Victor Zsasz (AKA Mr. Zsasz). Zsasz’s most obvious physical elements are the dozens of scars he has all over his body for each of his victims, so Messina can probably look forward to a lengthy sit each morning in the makeup chair. In directly related news, Ali Wong has also been cast in the film&nbsp;as an “associate of Renee Montoya.” Warner Bros has scheduled Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) for release on February 7, 2020 (up against another sequel, Peter Rabbit 2).6. NEW BRIGHTBURN TRAILER REIMAGINES SUPERMAN ORIGIN AS HORROR STORY(Photo by Sony Pictures Entertainment)It appears unlikely that we will ever see director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) directly work on another Marvel Studios film, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s done with the superhero genre. In October, we learned that Gunn had been hired by Marvel’s “distinguished competition” at Warner Bros to write the screenplay for Suicide Squad 2 (with an eye towards possibly directing). This week, the first trailer for Brightburn (which Gunn co-wrote and produced) debuted, and it revealed that the film appears to be a reinterpretation of Superman’s classic origin story. Put another way, “what if Kal-El was had been evil?” Elizabeth Banks will play the alien kid’s human stepmom when Brightburn crashes into theaters next year on May 24, 2019, up against Disney’s Aladdin remake, Brad Pitt’s Ad Astra, and the western biopic (Billy) The Kid.Rotten Ideas3. SHARK SEQUEL 47 METERS DOWN: UNCAGED SET FOR NEXT SUMMER(Photo by Dimension Films)Although the shark movie 47 Meters Down received a Rotten Tomatometer score of 54%, the film also earned a domestic box office take of $44 million from a budget of just $5.5 million, so it’s probably not surprising that it’s getting a sequel. Mandy Moore, Claire Holt, and Matthew Modine won’t be returning for the second film (for obvious reasons, at least&nbsp;for two of them), which will instead feature a new ensemble cast led by Nia Long and Corinne Foxx (daughter of Jamie). The other films swimming around 47 Meters Down: Uncaged on June 28, 2019 will be Ford v Ferrari (starring Christian Bale and Matt Damon), Limited Partners (with Tiffany Haddish, Rose Byrne, and Salma Hayek), and the untitled musical from director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire). We continue to be baffled why the sequel, once known as&nbsp;47 Meters Down: The Next Chapter, refuses to&nbsp;embrace the admittedly obvious but far less clunky title&nbsp;48 Meters Down.2.&nbsp;THE TOXIC AVENGER&nbsp;IS GETTING A BIG BUDGET REBOOT(Photo by Troma Films)Although both 1984’s The Toxic Avenger and 2000’s&nbsp;Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV&nbsp;received Fresh Tomatometer&nbsp;scores of 70%, the second film has an absolutely Rotten 0%, and the third film wasn’t even reviewed enough to earn a score. The Toxic Avenger became such a cult fan favorite that he became the company mascot of Troma Entertainment, the super low-budget production company behind such chestnuts as Blood Sucking Freaks, Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, and Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead. Despite its gonzo origins, The Toxic Avenger is now being developed as a new big budget superhero franchise by Legendary Entertainment, the company behind The Dark Knight, Watchmen, and Godzilla. In addition to the four feature length movies, The Toxic Avenger was also adapted as “a stage musical production, a children’s cartoon TV series, and a Marvel comic.”1. ASSASSIN’S CREED PRODUCER NOW WORKING ON A SUPER-UNTIMELY DUKE NUKEM(Photo by dukenukem.com)There was once a time during which video games were largely perceived as&nbsp;products for children or teenagers (and more specifically, teenaged boys). It was at the height of that era, in 1991, when the original Duke Nukem franchise debuted;&nbsp;the games are littered with certain depictions of female characters that&nbsp;have not aged well&nbsp;at all. So, one might think that Duke Nukem would absolutely not be a franchise that would ever be adapted as a movie for 2020 or later, but guess what? That’s exactly what’s happening. The Duke Nukem project is being produced by Jean-Julien Baronnet, who also produced the video game-based 2016 disappointment&nbsp;Assassin’s Creed (Rotten at 17%), and all that’s without even&nbsp;mentioning the very Rotten legacy of the nearly 50 previous video game adaptations to date.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Channel, police, marvel, boxoffice, Lifetime, kids, cancelled, Turner, APB, MSNBC, Warner, documentary, Netflix, Family","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14233146/Doctor_Strange_Sequel_Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"doctor-strange-sequel-slated-for-potential-2021-release-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509180943663","title":"Original Conjuring Stars Return for Annabelle 3, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Original Conjuring Stars Return for Annabelle 3, and More Movie NewsIdris Elba joins Cats, John Krasinski begins work on A Quiet Place 2, Tom &amp; Jerry gets updated, and The Flash gets delayed.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 19, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Annabelle 3, Cats, The Flash, Tom &amp; Jerry, and Wrong Turn.This WEEK’S TOP STORYORIGINAL&nbsp;CONJURING STARS RETURN FOR&nbsp;ANNABELLE 3Ryan FujitaniLast month’s&nbsp;The Nun (Rotten at 26%) was the fifth in New Line Cinema’s “Conjuring Universe” franchise of films, but it’s far from the last, with The Conjuring 3, Annabelle 3, and The Crooked Man (like&nbsp;The Nun, a spinoff of The Conjuring 2) also in development or preproduction. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga have long been presumed to be returning as Ed and Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring 3&nbsp;when it’s released&nbsp;on September 11, 2020. This week’s news, however, confirms that the Warrens (based on real people) will be joining one of the non-Conjuring films in the franchise for the first time. Wilson and Farmiga will reprise their roles in the third Annabelle movie, which is scheduled for release on July 3, 2019 (two days before Spider-Man: Far From Home). Like the first two Annabelle movies, Annabelle 3 will be a prequel to The Conjuring, but it’ll be more directly connected, as it will depict how the doll “awakens the [artifact] room’s evil which sets its sights on a new target: the Warrens’ ten year old daughter Judy. The young girl, along with her teenage babysitter cousin and the cousin’s friend, square off against the evil doll.” Judy Warren will be played by the previously announced McKenna Grace (Gifted), who is also playing the child version of the title character in next year’s Captain Marvel (3/8/2019).Fresh Developments1. IDRIS ELBA TO&nbsp;PLAY MCAVITY IN CATS MOVIE(Photo by Michael Gibson/STX Entertainment)It may have taken decades for Hollywood to finally get around to making a Cats movie (37 years after the musical premiered in 1981), but now that it’s finally happening, it’s had no problem&nbsp;finding stars. Before this week, it&nbsp;had already attracted the talents of TV host James Corden, Sir Ian McKellen, pop star Taylor Swift, and Jennifer Hudson (Dreamgirls), who will sing the signature song “Memory” as Grizabella. Universal’s kitty cat cavalcade of stars continued this week as the studio successfully attracted the talents of another Brit, Pacific Rim and The Wire star Idris Elba. Elba is expected to be playing Macavity, described as “the only real villain in the musical,” and the focus of two of the musical’s songs (“Macavity: The Mystery Cat” and “Macavity Fight”). Dame Judi Dench, who nearly played Grizabella in the original West End production in 1981, has also joined the cast as Old Deuteronomy, the leader of the Jellicle cats (Deuteronomy is normally played by a male in the stage musical). Steven Spielberg is executive producing Cats for director Tom Hooper, all of whose films are Fresh, including his 2012 adaptation of the hit musical Les Miserables. Universal Pictures has scheduled Cats for release on December 20, 2019, up against Star Wars: Episode IX.2. AVENGERS 4&nbsp;HINTS AT CHARACTER TEASED IN GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL 2(Photo by Russo Brothers)Earlier this year, Avengers: Infinity War directors Anthony and Joe Russo “confirmed” that the much-promised character Adam Warlock would not be featured in next year’s Avengers 4. At that time, it was expected that Adam Warlock would be introduced in a future Guardians of the Galaxy film, as his (first) name was uttered at the end of last year’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. (It’s also important to note here that Adam Warlock is a central character in the original early 1990s Infinity War comic book storyline.) However, that was also before James Gunn was fired from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, presumably delaying that film (it had previously been speculated for release in 2020). Is it possible that now, Adam Warlock could be a part of the Avengers 4 storyline? This week, as the Russos wrapped filming of Avengers 4, they teased out an image of a glowing blue “something” that&nbsp;some fans are speculating could be related to Adam Warlock, whose backstory includes an incubation in a sort of “egg.” In related news, early images appeared online this week of upcoming Avengers toys&nbsp;that seem to tease a new team uniform for&nbsp;the upcoming film&nbsp;when it comes out next year on May 3, 2019.3. SHH…. JOHN KRASINSKI IS NOW WRITING A QUIET PLACE 2(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer/Paramount)This April’s sci-fi horror/thriller A Quiet Place wasn’t just a very profitable surprise blockbuster ($338 million globally from a budget of just $17 million). The film, directed by, co-written by, and co-starring John Krasinski,&nbsp;was also Certified Fresh at 95% on the Tomatometer, and is now making some pundits’ early Academy Awards prediction lists. Paramount Pictures moved quickly to start development on A Quiet Place 2, starting with scheduling the sequel for May 15, 2020 (up against the animated Scooby reboot, and the week before Godzilla vs Kong). Krasinski gave an update this week, stating that after initially telling Paramount to hire someone else, he is now actively&nbsp;writing the sequel. It’s not yet known if Krasinski’s wife, Emily Blunt, will also be returning to star in the sequel. Blunt will next be seen in Mary Poppins Returns (12/19/2018), and is currently filming another film for Disney, their attraction adaptation Jungle Cruise. That film had been scheduled for October, 2019, but this week it was pushed back nine months to July 24, 2020 (which is after A Quiet Place 2 comes out).4. CALL ME BY YOUR NAME DIRECTOR MAKING MOVIE BASED ON BOB DYLAN ALBUM(Photo by Magnolia Pictures)There was a very brief trend in the late 1970s when Hollywood made a few movies that were direct adaptations of recent pop songs (namely&nbsp;Convoy, Ode to Billy Joe, and Harper Valley PTA). It’s anyone’s guess why this didn’t continue to be a popular source (you can see 15 such examples right here), but there are certainly plenty of songs that could inspire films. Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino currently has a remake of the classic 1970s horror film Suspiria coming to theaters soon, and we now know that he’s also developing a movie based on Blood on the Tracks, the 1975 album written and recorded by Bob Dylan that gave us the song “Tangled Up in Blue.” Screenwriter Richard LaGravenese (who was nominated for an Academy Award for The Fisher King) is now working on adapting the album into a screenplay, although no indication has been given yet what the storyline will be. Richard LaGravenese also adapted the Liberace biopic&nbsp;Behind the Candelabra, which went on to win 11 Emmy Awards.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK5.&nbsp;MICHAEL B. JORDAN SETS SIGHTS ON ASSASSIN FRANCHISE-STARTER THE SILVER BEAR(Photo by Matt Kennedy/Marvel Studios)Superhero movies have asserted their dominance in recent years, but another genre that has been experiencing a resurgence since the 2014 success of John Wick is the hitman/assassin action movie, which has recently included American Assassin, Proud Mary, The Hitman’s Bodyguard, and Deadpool&nbsp;(which, to be fair, is also a superhero movie). Michael B. Jordan (who also recently had a runaway hit with Black Panther) is now jumping on the assassin bandwagon, as he will produce and star in Lionsgate’s adaptation of The Silver Bear, based on a novel by screenwriter and TV showrunner Derek Haas. The Silver Bear is the first novel in a four-book series about an assassin named Columbus. In addition to being an author, Derek Haas is also one of the showrunners of NBC’s Chicago Fire and its spinoff shows Chicago P.D. and Chicago Med. We’re calling this one a “Rotten Idea” based on the Tomatometers for both Haas (4 Rotten scores vs 2 Fresh scores), and for Michael B. Jordan when he’s not working with Ryan Coogler.4.&nbsp;DAVE BAUTISTA AND JOHN CENA BOTH MAKING KID-CENTRIC ACTION MOVIES(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, JA/Everett Collection)Now that Marvel has apparently delayed production of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, Dave Bautista is moving on instead to an action movie called My Spy, the premise of which we learned more about this week. As it turns out, My Spy&nbsp;stars Bautista as a CIA operative&nbsp;who is assigned to go undercover watching a family and finds himself “at the mercy of a precocious 9-year-old girl” (played by Chloe Coleman of HBO’s Big Little Lies). Bautista and Coleman will also be joined by Ken Jeong (The Hangover, TV’s Community) and Kristen Schaal (30 Rock,&nbsp;The Last Man on Earth). Perhaps coincidentally, fellow WWE star-turned-actor John Cena is also now signed to star in an action movie for Paramount Players called Playing with Fire, about “a group of rugged wildfire fighters who meet their match when they rescue a trio of rambunctious children.” Dave Bautista’s career Tomatometer (not counting Marvel Studios movies) has several Rotten splats, as does John Cena’s prior&nbsp;to a handful of Fresh movies beginning in 2015. Frank Masi/Columbia Pictures3.&nbsp;TOM AND JERRY&nbsp;IS THE LATEST CLASSIC CARTOON TO GET A FRESH CGI UPDATEAfter a run that has included two original films (2016’s Storks and last month’s Smallfoot), the Warner Animation Group appears to be shifting focus toward rebooting classic cartoons for the 2020s. An update on this came along with the revelation this week that WAG has hired director Tim Story to direct a new animated movie starring the classic slapstick cat-and-mouse duo of Tom and Jerry. It’s expected that Tom and Jerry will be an animated/live action hybrid. The fact that Tom and Jerry don’t speak is also seen as attractive to international markets, as much of the humor is&nbsp;based in physical comedy. Tim Story’s films&nbsp;have earned 8 Rotten scores and only three Fresh scores (two of which were Kevin Hart stand-up comedy films). Some of the related projects Warner Animated Group is currently developing are Space Jam 2 (starring LeBron James), Wile E. Coyote vs ACME, a new Scooby cartoon for 2020, and movies for The Jetsons, The Flintstones, and Wacky Races. Curiously, one project missing from that list is Speedy Gonzales, which comedian Eugenio Derbez has been signed to since 2016.2.&nbsp;THE FLASH&nbsp;SOLO MOVIE GETS DELAYED AGAIN(Photo by Warner Bros.)This week marked the fourth anniversary of this story on October 15, 2014, announcing the casting of Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin) as Warner Bros’ The Flash. At that point, it was known that Miller would star in The Flash in 2018 (that obviously didn’t happen), as well as other movies like Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League (both of which did happen). That four-year wait&nbsp;almost doubled this week as The Flash is now delayed until 2021. (The irony, of course, is that the “Fastest Man Alive” is now one of the slowest superhero movies in development.) The reason for the delay is so that Ezra Miller can co-star in Fantastic Beasts 3 (his other franchise for Warner Bros), which is expected to start filming in early 2019 (when The Flash was previously expected to film), with The Flash now pushed back to start filming in late 2019 at the earliest.1.&nbsp;COULD A&nbsp;WRONG TURN&nbsp;REMAKE BE… A WRONG TURN?(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. courtesy Everett Collection)In 2003, Eliza Dushku starred in a horror thriller called Wrong Turn, which earned a Rotten score of 41% and mixed box office results with a domestic take of $15 million from a budget of $12 million. Even so, that movie went on to spawn a franchise of five direct-to-video sequels, including one movie (Wrong Turn 2: Dead End) which actually earned a Fresh score (78%). The franchise’s producers are now preparing to restart the Wrong Turn&nbsp;series with a new screenplay&nbsp;about a group of young people who find themselves stranded and at the mercy of “West Virginia cannibals.” The new Wrong Turn will reportedly be about how a “cross-country hiking expedition puts a group of friends in the land of an inclusive society, where they soon discover they are under a different rule of law, and may not be the victims they thought they were.” (What, like they made the cannibals eat them?)","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"nightmare, comic, rt, what","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/19155220/Conjuring-Stars-to-Annabelle-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"original-conjuring-stars-return-for-annabelle-3-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509180935468","title":"A Breaking Bad Movie Is Coming, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})A Breaking Bad Movie Is Coming, and More NewsPaddington 3, Jonny Quest, and a Rock Hudson biopic are in the works, and Super Mario Bros., Shrek, and The Color Purple are getting remade.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 9, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Breaking Bad, The Color Purple, Paddington 3, and the Shrek reboot.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJESSE PINKMAN&nbsp;WILL CONTINUE&nbsp;BREAKING BAD IN SEQUEL FILM(Photo by Lewis Jacobs/AMC)One of the recurring themes throughout 2018 has been about Emmy-winning TV dramas getting their own movies. The Downton Abbey movie is currently filming, and this week production began on the Deadwood movie, with pretty much the entire cast returning. (Farther down the road is The Many Saints of Newark, the prequel to HBO’s The Sopranos, which was announced in March.)&nbsp; The Sopranos won an Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series, and Deadwood and Downton Abbey were both nominated in that category (and won in others). Breaking Bad also won in that category twice, and this week we learned that filming is about to begin on a movie that&nbsp;will be a direct sequel to the events of the series finale episode. Breaking Bad executive producer Vince Gilligan wrote the movie, which is listed as starting production in New Mexico in mid-November under the working title Greenbriar. Aaron Paul will be returning as Jesse Pinkman in the film,&nbsp;described as “the escape of a kidnapped man and his quest for freedom.” When we last saw Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad, he had been kidnapped by a Neo-Nazi gang and had just begun his escape from them. It’s not yet known if the Breaking Bad movie is being made to air on AMC, or if it will receive a theatrical release. It’s also not known which other Breaking Bad cast members might return.Fresh Developments1. PADDINGTON 3 IN DEVELOPMENTRyan FujitaniThe British family film sequel Paddington 2 has now been on video around the world since April, and it still maintains its Certified Fresh 100% Tomatometer score. (Paddington 2&nbsp;was also a global box office phenomenon, earning $226 million from a budget of just $40 million.) The next step in the Paddington franchise is therefore perhaps not surprising, but yes,&nbsp;Paddington 3 is now in early development. The director of the first two films, Paul King, is now attached to both a live-action Pinocchio movie for Disney and a Willy Wonka prequel for Warner Bros., both of which came to his door following his work on Paddington and Paddington 2. So it’s looking like King will not return for Paddington 3, according to the franchise’s producer David Heyman. Of course, plenty could still change, as Paddington 3 also doesn’t have a screenplay yet. Ben Whishaw, the voice of Paddington, will next co-star as the adult Michael Banks in next month’s Mary Poppins Returns (12/19/18).2. STEVEN SPIELBERG AND OPRAH WINFREY REMAKING THE COLOR PURPLE AS A MOVIE MUSICAL(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Steven Spielberg is currently preparing his next film as director, which will be a remake of the 1961 movie musical classic&nbsp;West Side Story. As it turns out, however, West Side Story won’t be the only musical remake on&nbsp;his agenda, as he and Oprah Winfrey are reuniting on another. In 1985, Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, and Oprah Winfrey co-starred in The Color Purple (Fresh at 85%), based on the novel by Alice Walker, and it was nominated for 11 Academy Awards. Spielberg, Winfrey, and Quincy Jones are collaborating on a musical remake of The Color Purple at Warner Bros., the studio behind another recent musical remake, A Star is Born. A musical adaptation of The Color Purple opened on Broadway in 2005 and earned 11 Tony nominations, and this movie will likely be a fairly direct adaptation of that musical.3. DESPICABLE ME CREATORS NOW REBOOTING SHREK (AND PUSS IN BOOTS)(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)When Universal Pictures acquired DreamWorks Animation in 2016, there was talk about the impact&nbsp;it would have on the Shrek franchise, but it wasn’t until this week that we first heard post-merger what exactly would happen. Both Shrek and its spinoff Puss in Boots are now being rebooted by Chris Meledandri, the producer behind such Illumination Entertainment films as Despicable Me, Sing, and The Secret Life of Pets. Although it’s being called a Shrek “reboot,” Melelandri reportedly wants to keep the franchise’s voice cast in place, including Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Antonio Banderas (though Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow weren’t mentioned). Meledandri’s next animated films will all be sequels: The Secret Life of Pets 2 (6/7/2019), Minions 2 (7/3/2020), and Sing 2 (12/25/2020), so the earliest we can probably expect the next Shrek movie would be sometime in 2021.4. ORIGINAL SUPER MARIO BROS CREATOR TO GUIDE THE 2022 ANIMATED MOVIE(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)In addition to their aforementioned plans for rebooting Shrek, Universal Pictures also has high hopes for Super Mario Bros, an animated adaptation of the popular Nintendo game franchise. Video game adaptations are one of the areas where movies are most consistently “Rotten Ideas,” but every once in a while, we see a project that has enough promise&nbsp;to finally turn the “Rotten” trend around. Talking to Variety this week, Illumination’s Chris Meledandri revealed that he is “working closely” with Super Mario Bros producer Shigeru Miyamoto&nbsp;on the Super Mario Bros movie planned for release in 2022. Although many video game adaptations obviously are produced in tandem with the the video game companies themselves, Miyamoto’s connection with Super Mario Bros runs all the way back, and suggests a promise of a more faithful adaptation than the live-action 1993 movie starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo.5. 1960s ANIMATED ADVENTURE JONNY QUEST GETTING LIVE ACTION REBOOT(Photo by Hanna-Barbera courtesy Everett Collection)In the last few years, we’ve seen repeated instances&nbsp;of directors of popular animated movies inheriting ambitious live-action films. For example, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs‘ Phil Lord and Chris Miller were given the reins to the&nbsp;21 Jump Street franchise, and&nbsp;The Incredibles‘ Brad Bird tackled&nbsp;Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.&nbsp;Warner Bros. is keeping one of their animated hits more “in house” this week with the news that they have recruited director Chris McKay (The LEGO Batman Movie) to work on their long-in-development adaptation of Jonny Quest. To give you an idea of exactly how long Jonny Quest has been in development, consider that there was a point where the star of Jonny Quest at one point was nearly Zac Efron (who is now 31 years old). Like many other long-in-development projects, the roots of Jonny Quest are very, very old, as the original animated TV series ran from 1964 to 1974.&nbsp;The show is so old, in fact, that viewers of a certain age might be more familiar with Venture Bros, the animated show that spoofed Jonny Quest, than they are with the original show itself. Warner Bros. reportedly is now looking for a major action movie star (someone like Vin Diesel or Dwayne Johnson) to play Race Bannon, Jonny’s secret-agent-turned-bodyguard.6.&nbsp;FINN AND SHURI&nbsp;TO STAR IN SCI-FI LOVE STORY HOLD BACK THE STARS(Photo by Priscilla Grant, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)If we spin back the clock about a year, few people outside of Marvel fans awaiting Black Panther were familiar with Letitia Wright. That, however, was before her role as T’Challa’s sister Shuri first in Black Panther and then Avengers: Infinity War established her as one of the year’s brightest breakout stars. The Guyanese-born British actress is now preparing to make a transition beyond Marvel&nbsp;with news this week of two promising projects. The first film we heard about is a remake of the 2017 French dramedy Le Brio, in which Wright will be joined by singer-turned-actor John Legend. Wright will play an immigrant “woman from an underprivileged neighborhood”, and Legend will play “a brilliant but prejudiced professor… who is forced to coach her for an annual speech contest.” Letitia Wright will also team up with Star Wars: The Last Jedi star John Boyega in a sci-fi love story called Hold Back the Stars. Their characters will “revisit memories of their love affair on a utopian Earth while they are trapped in the vast void of space with only 90 minutes of oxygen.”7. SPIKE LEE ADAPTING ONE-MAN-STAGE SHOW FREDERICK DOUGLASS NOW(Photo by Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)There’s no shortage of historically significant figures who either have never had a movie made about them or could use a fresh update. Underground Railroad leader Harriet Tubman was one example, but she’s&nbsp;getting her own movie starring Tony winner Cynthia Erivo. Another African American leader who we don’t “know from the movies” is Frederick Douglass. Following the success this summer of his BlackKklansman, director Spike Lee is now preparing to adapt the one-man stage show Frederick Douglass Now, which will mark his third adaptation of a stage show by his Do the Right Thing star Roger Guenveur Smith. Netflix picked up Lee’s Rodney King, adapted from Guenveur Smith’s show, but it’s unclear where Frederick Douglass Now might end up, as Douglass himself obviously has a potentially wider appeal as a historical figure deserving of a major motion picture.8. ROCK HUDSON BIOPIC IN THE WORKS AT UNIVERSALThe Queen rock biopic Bohemian Rhapsody just opened last week, and although we can argue about how the film addressed Freddie Mercury’s death, the AIDS epidemic does loom large over Mercury’s death and legacy. Another entertainment icon who struggled with AIDS in the 1980s was movie star Rock Hudson, who for much of his career was much more “closeted” than Mercury. Universal Pictures is now preparing to adapt Hudson’s life story as a major motion picture with the news this week that the studio has optioned the book All That Heaven Allows: A Biography of Rock Hudson by Mark Griffin. The plan at Universal is for the untitled Rock Hudson biopic to be directed by Greg Berlanti, who this year is coming off the gay coming-of-age drama Love Simon. Berlanti has also worked extensively on DC Comics TV shows like Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, and Titans.9. WILL FERRELL, PRINCE OF FASHION, AND FORCE MAJEURE(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Will Ferrell is preparing for the release of his latest comedy with John C. Reilly, which is their take on Sherlock Holmes called Holmes &amp; Watson. As sometimes happens, Ferrell was featured in not one news story, but two separate projects. The first one we heard about is Downhill, which will be a remake of the Swedish film Force Majeure. Will Ferrell’s co-star will be Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and their directors will be Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (cowriters of The Descendants, and you may also know Rash as Dean Pelton from Community). Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfuss will play a married couple whose narrow survival of an avalanche forces them to re-evaluate their relationship. Will Ferrell will also team up with director Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting, My Own Private Idaho) for an adaptation of a GQ article called My Son, The Prince of Fashion, in which he will play a reporter who travels to Paris and discovers just how much his 13-year-old son loves the world of fashion.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"BBC, spain, renewed, Netflix, FX, FX, universal, superhero, movies, spanish, CW, USA, Disney, Comics, Valentine's","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/09115241/Breaking-Bad-Ketchup-Rep.jpg","slug":"a-breaking-bad-movie-is-coming-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509180966200","title":"Chris Pine May Not Return for Star Trek 4, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Chris Pine May Not Return for Star Trek 4, and More Movie NewsMulan unveils first image, and new roles for Tessa Thompson, Laura Dern, Elizabeth Banks, Benicio del Toro, and Anthony Mackie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 17, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Lady and the Tramp, Little Women, Mulan, and Star Trek 4.This WEEK’S TOP STORYCAPTAIN KIRK (AND HIS DAD) MIGHT&nbsp;NOT RETURN FOR&nbsp;STAR TREK 4(Photo by Kimberley French/Paramount Pictures)On paper,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;franchise might seem (to the rest of us) like pretty a sweet deal. If you’re lucky enough to hitch your star to it, you’re&nbsp;looking at pretty&nbsp;steady work, as new installments come around every few years. On the other hand, movie stars have certain salary expectations, especially if they’re attached — or potentially attached — to more than one franchise. Star Trek 4&nbsp;(the fourth film with the current cast)&nbsp;is still moving forward, despite the disappointing box office for 2016’s Star Trek Beyond,&nbsp;but this week, the casting hit a snag, as “the two Chrises” involved might not sign on. Chris Pine (Captain Kirk), and Chris Hemsworth (who plays his dad, George Kirk), have reportedly walked away from Star Trek 4 after salary negotiations fell through. The other cast members, like Zoe Saldana (Uhura), Zachary Quinto (Spock), Karl Urban (McCoy), Simon Pegg (Scotty), and John Cho (Sulu) had been expected to start negotiations next, but Pine and Hemsworth walking away leaves the project in limbo. It’s not yet known what Paramount will do with Star Trek 4 next, although recasting the two Kirks is definitely still a possibility. Which actor would you cast as the next Captain James T. Kirk?Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;YOUTUBE BRUCE LEE FAN TO PLAY HIM IN TARANTINO’S ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOODMike Moh is a YouTube personality who has posted tributes to 1970s martial arts star Bruce Lee. Quentin Tarantino is filling in the holes in his own tribute to Hollywood, next year’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. This week, those two things converged, as Moh has been cast by Tarantino to co-star in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as Bruce Lee. The reason for including Lee in this movie, set in Los Angeles in the summer of 1969 before and after the Manson murders, is that Roman Polanski bizarrely once suspected Bruce Lee of murdering his wife, Sharon Tate (to be played by Margot Robbie). (We haven’t yet heard who will play Polanski, but a popular guess is frequent Tarantino star Christoph Waltz). Columbia Pictures has scheduled Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for July 26, 2019 (the week after Disney’s remake of The Lion King).2. LAURA DERN JOINS MERYL STREEP IN GRETA GERWIG’S LITTLE WOMEN(Photo by Anne Marie Fox/Fox Searchlight)One of the most notable breakout directors of this most recent “awards season” was actress-turned-director Greta Gerwig, who made her feature film debut with Lady Bird, which received five Academy Award nominations. For her next film, Gerwig is writing and directing a new adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women, the most recent major adaptation of which (Fresh at 91%&nbsp;and celebrating its 25th anniversary next year) featured Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, Susan Sarandon, and Christian Bale. Jurassic Park and Blue Velvet star Laura Dern is now in talks to join Greta Gerwig’s&nbsp;adaptation, and though&nbsp;her role hasn’t been revealed yet, it’s reported that she will have scenes with Meryl Streep. The other Little Women co-stars will include Saoirse Ronan, Timothee Chalamet (both from Lady Bird), Emma Stone, and Florence Pugh (Lady MacBeth).3. TESSA THOMPSON TO VOICE DISNEY’S LIVE ACTION LADY (AND THE TRAMP)(Photo by Annapurna Pictures)Next year, Disney will be launching their big new (not yet named)&nbsp;streaming service, which will feature not just their existing television and film content, but also new features produced specifically for the new app. Many of the live-action projects that were previously expected to get theatrical releases are now being produced for streaming, including remakes of Father of the Bride, Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Three Men and a Baby, and The Sword in the Stone. One of the highest profile of these is Lady and the Tramp, a live-action remake that revisits the 1955 animated Disney classic. The title characters will be voiced by Tessa Thompson (Thor: Ragnarok,&nbsp;Westworld) and Justin Theroux (HBO’s The Leftovers). Supporting dog voices will also include Benedict Wong (Doctor Strange) as an English bulldog suitably named Bull and Kiersey Clemons (Dope) as a Scottish Terrier named Jackie (replacing “Jock” from the original film). The&nbsp;new&nbsp;Lady and the Tramp will be directed by Charlie Bean (The LEGO Ninjago Movie), and is expected to debut on Disney’s streaming service sometime in 2019.4. DISNEY’S LIVE ACTION MULAN REMAKE CASTS UP, AND REVEALS FIRST IMAGE(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)In addition to sending some of their live-action remakes to streaming, Walt Disney Pictures is also still&nbsp;producing others that will indeed receive theatrical releases. The next four will be The Nutcracker and the Four Realms (from Fantasia) (11/2/18), Dumbo (3/29/19), Aladdin (5/24/19), and The Lion King (7/19/19), but the movie that made the biggest headlines this week is the fifth.&nbsp;Mulan is scheduled for March 27, 2020, and it’s now filming at locations in both China and New Zealand. This week, Disney revealed the first image of Liu Yifei in character as Mulan, as well as several new cast members. Rosalind Chao (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), Cheng Pei-Pei (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), and Nelson Lee were revealed first, and they were then followed the next day by YouTube star Jimmy Wong and Doug Moua (Gran Torino). The other movie currently scheduled for March 27th, 2020 against Mulan is the reboot of G.I. Joe.5.&nbsp;MARVEL’S FALCON, ANTHONY MACKIE, JOINS AMY ADAMS IN THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW(Photo by Marvel Studios)The #1 best selling novel of 2018 so far is A.J. Finn’s The Woman in the Window, about an agoraphobic child psychologist who witnesses her neighbors committing a crime. The scenario sounds a lot like Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window (and not at all like the 1944 Fritz Lang film noir starring Edward G. Robinson, also called The Woman in the Window). Fox 2000 has moved quickly this year towards getting their film adaptation of The Woman in the Window&nbsp;into theaters next year with a series of announcements that have included hiring director Joe Wright (Darkest Hour, Atonement), and stars Amy Adams, Julianne Moore, and Wright’s Darkest Hour star Gary Oldman. The latest new cast member is Anthony Mackie, who is probably best known as playing Falcon in Marvel’s various Avengers and Captain America movies. The Woman in the Window is scheduled for release on October 4, 2019 (up against the Will Smith sci-fi action movie Gemini Man, and DC Comics’ Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Robert De Niro).6. RUMOR OF THE WEEK #1: NEW DETAILS EMERGE ABOUT WES ANDERSON’S NEXT FILM(Photo by Greg Williams/Fox Searchlight)Generally, the Weekly Ketchup tries to avoid so-called “rumors,” but every once in a while, a story will bypass major sources (at least initially). It can also be tricky when a story comes from international press, if only because possible translation issues may emerge. This week, a French publication called Sud Ouest ran a story about director Wes Anderson (The Grand Budapest Hotel, Moonrise Kingdom), who is currently coming off his second stop-motion film, Isle of Dogs&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 89%). Anderson is indeed reportedly returning to live action, and his next film will continue his international tour, which has already included India (The Darjeeling Limited), the Mediterranean Sea (The Life Aquatic), and a fictional nation in Eastern Europe (The Grand Budapest Hotel). Wes Anderson is reportedly scouting locations in Angoulême, France, aiming to start filming in February, 2019 for a 2020 release. The premise of the not-yet-titled film is also not yet known, but it’s rumored to be set in France in the years just after World War II.7. RUMOR OF THE WEEK #2: IS HYDRO-MAN ONE OF THE&nbsp;SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME&nbsp;VILLAINS?(Photo by Marvel Studios)This story starts with an Instagram video post from actor Tom Holland (Marvel’s Spider-Man) that featured his stuntman engaging in a stunt involving a lot of water. Now, there are many reasons why next year’s Spider-Man: Far From Home (July 5, 2019) might feature a scene in which Spider-Man is doused in water, but some fans immediately guessed that it might involve Hydro-Man, one of Spidey’s less famous villains, who first debuted in 1981. We already know that Jake Gyllenhaal has been cast as Mysterio in Spider-Man: Far From Home, but these movies frequently have more than just one villain, so it’s certainly reasonable to guess that Mysterio could be joined by Hydro-Man as well. We also recently learned that Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders will co-star (as Nick Fury and Maria Hill) in Spider-Man: Far From Home, but&nbsp;nothing in that story gave us any clues about Hydro-Man.8.&nbsp;ELIZABETH BANKS TO STAR IN PRINCE/MTV TRUE STORY QUEEN FOR A DAY(Photo by Saeed Adyani/Netflix)Last year, The Daily Beast ran a story called “When Prince Made a Chambermaid His Queen for a Day,” about the true story in 1986 when MTV ran a “Win a Day with Prince” contest. The winner was a motel chambermaid from a Wyoming town of Sheridan (population: 10,369), and as part of the contest, Prince (along with Martha Quinn and other MTV crew) traveled there at the height of his fame. You can read the rest of that original story and see footage of the coverage here, if you don’t mind being spoiled. And the reason you might not want to be spoiled is that this true story, Queen for a Day, is now in development at Paramount Players, with Elizabeth Banks producing and attached to star. (It’s unclear if Banks will be playing the contest winner, since, at 44, Banks is notably older than the 20-year-old who was at the heart of this story.) It’s also unknown whom might be cast as Prince.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1. BENICIO DEL TORO TO TELL WHITE LIES FOR OLIVER STONE(Photo by Jonathan Olley/Walt Disney Studios)Director Oliver Stone may have become famous for his impressive streak of 1980s films like Salvador, Platoon, Wall Street, Talk Radio, and Born on the Fourth of July, but the argument is there in his Tomatometer that he’s become infamous in the last two decades for films like W. (Rotten at 58%), South of the Border (50%), Savages (51%), and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (54%). For his next film, Stone is eschewing fact-based dramas like W. and Snowden for a New York-set drama&nbsp;that takes place across three generations called White Lies. Benicio del Toro, who previously worked with Stone in 2012’s Savages, will star in White Lies as a “a child of divorce now repeating his parents’ mistakes in his own marriage and with his troubled son.” Will White Lies offset the recent tendency toward Rotten scores on Oliver Stone’s Tomatometer?","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"anthology, Podcast, Rey, laika, Emmys, street, Network, adaptation, DirecTV, archives, Comics, women, Video, &, cars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/17155821/Chris-Pine-Beyond-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"chris-pine-may-not-return-for-star-trek-4-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509182661947","title":"Ryan Reynolds Plans a Stoner Version of Home Alone, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ryan Reynolds Plans a Stoner Version of Home Alone, and More Movie NewsNew gigs for Natalie Portman, Kristen Stewart, and Jennifer Connelly, the Coens reveal a new film, and David Leitch wants to remake Enter the Dragon.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 27, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Cats, Charlie’s Angels, and new movies directed by James Franco, Natalie Portman, and the Coen Bros.This WEEK’S TOP STORYRYAN REYNOLDS IS PRODUCING AN R-RATED REMAKE OF HOME ALONE(Photo by 29th Century Fox Film Corp.)Even as the Fox/Disney deal was being closed this week, one of Fox’s most popular family-friendly franchises was being revived for a new era (and a completely different tone and intended audience). That franchise is Home Alone, which started as a 1990 John Hughes movie starring Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern, inspiring four sequels (some with different actors). This new movie will be called Stoned Alone, which indicates that it will not be&nbsp;a family movie, but&nbsp;an R-rated comedy. Stoned Alone will tell the story of a weed-smoking loser who misses a holiday ski trip, decides to get high instead, and suffers a paranoid delusion that his house is being invaded by thieves… except that there really are&nbsp;thieves invading his home. Ryan Reynolds is producing Stoned Alone for Fox, with an eye towards possibly starring as the stoner (though at 41, Reynolds is a bit long in the tooth for the “20-something” character. The Home Alone franchise has thus far earned over $476 million globally.Fresh Developments1. COEN BROS REVEAL SURPRISE FILM THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS(Photo by First Look Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Last year, Netflix announced plans for a six episode series from writers/directors Joel and Ethan Coen (The Big Lebowski, Fargo) called The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. This week, however, when September’s Venice Film Festival revealed its competition lineup, one of the films was The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, now confirmed to be a movie. The 132-minute film will have a “chaptered anthology structure,” which ties into the original plan for six “episodes.” In their statement, the Coens explained, “We’ve always loved anthology movies, especially those films made in Italy in the Sixties which set side-by-side the work of different directors on a common theme.” The cast of The Ballad of Buster Scruggs includes Tim Blake Nelson (O Brother, Where Art Thou?) as the title character, Zoe Kazan (The Big Sick), Liam Neeson, and Tom Waits. Netflix is expected to give The Ballad of Buster Scruggs an awards-season qualifying theatrical run this fall before it starts streaming on their service (similar to how they released Mudbound, which&nbsp;earned four Academy Award nominations, last year).2. YOU’LL LAUGH, YOU’LL CRY, BUT WILL THE CATS MOVIE BE BETTER THAN THE MUSICAL?(Photo by Oscilloscope)Last year marked the 35th anniversary of the Broadway debut of the musical Cats, based on T.S. Elliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats. The furry-costumed play about the Jellicles tribe of Cats went on to become the 4th longest play in Broadway history, and gave the world the ballad “Memory.” Next summer, Disney is going to deliver their “live action” remake of The Lion King (7/19/19), and perhaps as a reaction to that, Cats is finally getting its own movie, too. Although Cats is associated in the USA with Broadway, it started as a British production, and the movie will be British as well, to be produced by Working Title. Cats will be directed by Tom Hooper (The King’s Speech), who in 2012 gave us the long-awaited adaptation of the musical Les Miserables. Tom Hooper and Cats&nbsp;have attracted an impressive four stars that include three singers (Jennifer Hudson, Taylor Swift, James Corden), and Lord of the Rings and X-Men star Sir Ian McKellen. The roles of the other three are unclear, but Hudson will play Grizabella, the “glamour cat” who gets to sing “Memory.” Cats will start filming in England in November. In related news, studios are currently engaged in a bidding war in the $50 million range for the rights to a 2016 live performance of Hamilton, featuring Lin-Manuel Miranda, to be released theatrically in 2020 or 2021.3. NATALIE PORTMAN TO PLAY TWIN SISTERS ANN LANDERS AND DEAR ABBY(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Paramount Pictures)If you’re old enough to remember when advice columnists Ann Landers and Dear Abby, there’s one bizarre bit of trivia you may or may not know about them. Dear Abby was written by Pauline Phillips and Ask Ann Landers was written, after 1955, by her twin sister Esther “Eppie” Lederer. That’s right — the two columnists who were direct competitors with each other were also identical twins. It’s a pop culture historical twist perfectly made for a biopic, and Natalie Portman is in talks to take it on, as both director and the film’s two female leads. Portman’s directorial debut was 2015’s Israeli drama A Tale of Love and Darkness (Fresh at 67%), and she also starred in 2016’s Jackie as First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy.4. JAMES FRANCO: FROM THE DISASTER ARTIST TO AN ESPN ORIGIN MOVIE(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)If you’ve ever looked at the directorial filmography for actor James Franco, you might have noticed he’s directed a ton of movies (12 in the last 5 years). Of those, the one you’re most likely to have actually heard of is last year’s The Disaster Artist (Certified Fresh at 91%), in which Franco also starred as The Room director Tommy Wiseau. While Franco’s career behind the camera has been decidedly inconsistent,&nbsp;with&nbsp;The Disaster Artist,&nbsp;he may have shown that he’s learning from all of that extra experience. James Franco is now in talks to direct another true story based on relatively recent pop culture events,&nbsp;namely the early days of the ESPN cable TV network. The go-to comparison for such a movie is Aaron Sorkin’s 1998-2000 TV comedy Sports Night, except that the premise seems to focus on the financing hurdles that ESPN’s founders had to overcome. The project will probably be called Those Guys Have All the Fun, as it’s an adaptation of the 2011 book by that title by co-authors James Andrew Miller and (noted TV critic) Tom Shales.5. DC COMICS’ JOKER MADE ROBERT DE NIRO AN OFFER HE COULDN’T REFUSE(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although Jared Leto gave us his own take on the Joker in Suicide Squad (and reportedly may someday return as the character), Joaquin Phoenix is all set to start filming his own Joker origin movie this fall. The Wrap is now reporting that project to be titled simply Joker, and that Robert De Niro&nbsp;is in talks to play a talk show host who is crucial to Phoenix’s character becoming the Joker. De Niro also starred in Martin Scorsese’s King of Comedy, which was reportedly an inspiration for director Todd Phillips’ (The Hangover, War Dogs) take on the Joker. Francis Conroy, who co-starred in HBO’s Six Feet Under is also in talks to co-star as the Joker’s mom “Penny.” These announcements came after the late news last week that the future Joker‘s potential romantic interest will be a single mother played by Zazie Beetz, who debuted as Marvel’s Domino this summer in Deadpool 2. We can also now report that&nbsp;Joker&nbsp;will be released on October 4th, 2019, up against the sci-fi action movie Gemini Man (starring Will Smith) and The Woman in the Window (starring Amy Adams, Julianne Moore, and Gary Oldman).6. KRISTEN STEWART TO LEAD ELIZABETH BANKS’ REBOOT OF CHARLIE’S ANGELS(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics)When Charlie’s Angels debuted on ABC in 1976, the show about a trio of female private investigators was quickly criticized (along with Three’s Company) as “Jiggle TV.” Charlie’s Angels was rebooted in movie form in 2000, but that film and its sequel were arguably more of the same (especially the way Cameron Diaz’s character was filmed). We’ve known for a while now that Elizabeth Banks (who made her directorial debut with Pitch Perfect 2, Fresh at 65%) was going to reboot Charlie’s Angels, and now we know more about how her take will be different. First off, there’s the title character, which was a man in the original TV show (voiced by John Forsyth), but in this third version will be played by Elizabeth Banks herself. Secondly, instead of private investigators, the Charlie’s Angels of 2019 will specialize in international “security and intelligence services,” so basically, they’re spies. Finally, where the 2000 Charlie’s Angels was sort of a supergroup of three popular actresses (Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu), the only “name” in the new movie will be Kristen Stewart, who will be joined by Naomi Scott (Power Rangers, and Jasmine in Disney’s upcoming Aladdin reboot), and British actress Ella Balinska. Charlie’s Angels is now scheduled for release on September 27, 2019 (up against the animated Yeti movie Abominable).7. JENNIFER CONNELLY’S GOT THAT LOVIN’ FEELIN’ AS THE TOP GUN: MAVERICK ROMANTIC LEAD(Photo by Richard Foreman/Lionsgate)The one scene that people who have never actually seen Top Gun might know (thanks to memes) is the “Playing with the Boys” beach volleyball montage. It’s emblematic of a movie so dripping with testosterone that you’d be forgiven if you forgot that Top Gun actually had a female lead, played by Kelly McGillis. With that in mind,&nbsp;Jennifer Connelly (Hulk, A Beautiful Mind, Requiem for a Dream) has signed on to play the Top Gun: Maverick female lead, which is described as a single mother who runs a bar near the airbase where Cruise’s Maverick is now a flight instructor. It’s not yet known if&nbsp; Connelly’s bar will also have a beach volleyball court. Top Gun: Maverick is being directed by Tom Cruise’s Oblivion director Joseph Kosinski, who only has one Fresh film out of three to date. Top Gun: Maverick will take off on July 12, 2019 (the week after Spider-Man: Far From Home, and the week before Disney’s The Lion King).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. ENTER THE REMAKE: DEADPOOL 2 DIRECTOR TO REDO A BRUCE LEE&nbsp;CLASSICMartial arts legend Bruce Lee died in 1973 at the age of 32, leaving behind&nbsp;just a handful of films (and the cobbled together 1978 film Game of Death). Lee’s last film, during which he actually died while dubbing, was 1973’s Enter the Dragon, about a Shaolin kung fu master who is recruited by British intelligence to infiltrate a crime lord’s secret martial arts competition. Last Friday (7/20/2018) marked the 45th anniversary of Bruce Lee’s death, which means that the summer of 2023 will mark the 50th anniversary. That perhaps is why development has started on a remake of Enter the Dragon, with director David Leitch in early talks to direct. Leitch got his start&nbsp;as a stunt coordinator, before co-directing John Wick, and then&nbsp;establishing a solo career&nbsp;with Atomic Blonde and this summer’s Deadpool 2. Warner Bros. has been trying to remake Enter the Dragon for a long time now, including previous attempts with both Spike Lee and disgraced Rush Hour director Brett Ratner. In (sort of) related news, Jason Scott Lee, who starred in Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, signed on with Disney recently to co-star as a villain in their live action remake of Mulan (3/27/2020).1. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY DIRECTOR FIRED(Photo by Jay Maidment/Walt Disney Studios)This year’s San Diego Comic-Con had an unusually low&nbsp;number of big announcements, and this was highlighted by the week’s biggest superhero movie news actually happening outside that venue. On Friday, Walt Disney Pictures announced that they had “severed our business relationship” with director James Gunn, who delivered the first two Guardians of the Galaxy movies, and had been developing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. The reason for Gunn’s dismissal was the recent re-discovery of several offensive “joke tweets” from 2008 to 2011. In response, Gunn said in a statement&nbsp;that, “regardless of how much time has passed, I understand and accept the business decisions taken today.” Gunn’s firing has inspired a wide spectrum of responses, from this Collider editorial&nbsp;to Dave Bautista being “NOT ok” with it, to Selma Blair saying Gunn is “one of the good ones,” to this response calling for criminal prosecution. Meanwhile,&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi has emerged as a fan favorite to replace Gunn on the inevitable Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (presuming his wacky “imaginary Hitler” movie Jojo Rabbit doesn’t stand in the way). It’s unfortunate that Gunn will no longer be involved with the&nbsp;Guardians, but honestly, he should have known better, too.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"spy, Disney, obituary, festivals, telelvision, The, game-of-thrones, Mystery, streaming, SDCC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/27152837/Deadpool-Home-Alone1.jpg","slug":"ryan-reynolds-plans-a-stoner-version-of-home-alone-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509182682429","title":"Billy Dee Williams Will Return for Star Wars: Episode IX, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Billy Dee Williams Will Return for Star Wars: Episode IX, and More Movie NewsBlack Widow secures its director, Downton Abbey gets a movie, RoboCop returns, and real life inspires a pair of duelling movies.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 13, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Black Widow, Downton Abbey, The Joker, Maleficent 2, and RoboCop Returns.This WEEK’S TOP STORYBILLY DEE WILLIAMS RETURNING FOR STAR WARS: EPISODE IX(Photo by Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images)In the months before the release of Solo: A Star Wars Story, it seemed very likely that Donald Glover would be returning for future Star Wars films as the young Lando Calrissian. That may still happen, but it’s less certain now that Solo proved to be a relative box office disappointment with less than $390 million after six weeks of release worldwide. (Especially following reports that Lucasfilm is halting development of Star Wars prequels.) That doesn’t, however, mean that the Star Wars franchise is done with Lando Calrissian, as Billy Dee Williams is officially returning for Star Wars: Episode IX (12/20/2019). We don’t know yet how big of a role Lando will have in Episode IX, but one easy guess is that&nbsp;he is likely to pay his respects&nbsp;in some way to the late General Leia Organa, following the 2016 death of Carrie Fisher. (You can read here for further speculation about Lando’s involvement in the Episode IX story). This news came within days of last week’s big news about Felicity star Keri Russell being the first new star of Episode IX. We don’t know anything yet about Russell’s role either, but one theory is that she could be playing Rey’s mother. Russell also made the news again this week, signing on with Guillermo Del Toro’s production company to star in the thriller Antlers for director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart, Black Mass, Hostiles).Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;MARVEL RECRUITS INDIE AUSTRALIAN DIRECTOR FOR BLACK WIDOW(Photo by Music Box Films courtesy Everett Collection)Back in 2014, Marvel Studios had their big Phase 3 event, at which they announced movies like Black Panther, next year’s Captain Marvel, and Avengers: Infinity War (and its sequel). We’re nearly running out of officially announced Marvel movies (after Spider-Man: Far from Home and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3), but one that we know for sure is happening is the solo Black Widow movie. Marvel has been talking to over 70 directors over the last few months, including meetings with Scarlett Johansson, and they’ve&nbsp;finally made their pick: Australian indie director Cate Shortland, whose films are still relatively obscure in the USA. Three of Shortland’s films to date&nbsp;are Certified Fresh&nbsp;—&nbsp;Somersault (83%), Lore (94%), and Berlin Syndrome (73%) — and she was reportedly an early favorite of Johansson’s, which gave her the deciding edge over directors like Amma Asante (A United Kingdom), Maggie Betts (Novitiate), Melanie Laurent (Galveston), and Kimberly Peirce (Boys Don’t Cry). There is no release date yet for Black Widow, or confirmation about whether it’s a prequel or set after the events of next year’s Avengers 4.2. BIG SCREEN DOWNTON ABBEY MOVIE GREENLIT FOR FILMING THIS SUMMER&nbsp;(Photo by Nick Briggs/Carnival Film &amp; Television Limited)Ever since&nbsp;Downton Abbey ended its sixth season in early 2015, we’ve been hearing about the show’s creator Julian Fellowes’ plans for an eventual big screen movie. What we didn’t know was when it might happen. For a while, Fellowes was working on an NBC series called The Gilded Age, set in New York in the late 1800s, with possible Downton Abbey ties, but three years later, that show has not yet been picked up. The Downton Abbey Twitter account kicked back into gear this morning with the announcement that filming has been greenlit to start this September. The “original main cast” are reportedly all returning, but one can read between the lines there to interpret that&nbsp;to mean the still-living characters. The Downton Abbey movie does not yet have a release date, but it will have a theatrical release, and&nbsp;it&nbsp;will be directed by Brian Percival (The Book Thief), who also directed the pilot episode.3. DISNEY SCHEDULES&nbsp;MALEFICENT 2 AND JUNGLE CRUISE, PUSHES INDY 5 BACK A YEAR&nbsp;(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Two weeks ago, we learned that Lucasfilm had hired Solo: A Star Wars Story cowriter Jonathan Kasdan to work on Indiana Jones 5, suggesting that the film would not make its July 10th, 2020 release date. This week, Disney (which owns Lucasfilm) announced release dates for four of its biggest upcoming films, including Indiana Jones 5, with one film for each year from 2018 to 2021. First up in chronological order is Mary Poppins Returns, which is moving by less than a week, from December 25th, 2018 to December 19th, 2018. (Despite the relatively small change, the new Mary Poppins Returns date may have a huge impact on other films scheduled for late 2018.) Dwayne Johnson’s theme park ride adaptation Jungle Cruise is now scheduled for October 11th, 2019 (up against The Addams Family, The Goldfinch, and Nickelodeon’s Are You Afraid of the Dark?). The 2020 date goes to Maleficent 2, starring Angelina Jolie, which is now scheduled for May 29th, 2020 (the week after Godzilla vs Kong, and the week before Mark Wahlberg’s The Six Billion Dollar Man). Finally, there’s Indiana Jones 5, which is now scheduled for July 9th, 2021, which is coincidentally four days before Harrison Ford‘s 79th birthday.4.&nbsp;BLACK PANTHER STARS CAST IN 17 BRIDGES, BACKYARD LEGEND, AND GODZILLA VS KONG(Photo by Marvel Studios)Marvel’s Black Panther is now the year’s second biggest release (after Avengers: Infinity War and its $2+ billion take), with a global earning of over $1.346 billion. As such, and as one would expect, the stars of Black Panther have continued to land plenty of new work, and there were three&nbsp;cases of that this week. Black Panther himself, Chadwick Boseman, has signed to star in an STXfilms action thriller called 17 Bridges, playing a “disgraced NYPD detective” who gets a chance at redemption during a citywide manhunt for a cop killer. Winston Duke, who plays rival tribal leader M’Baku, has also landed a new role in Backyard Legend, playing MMA fighter Kimbo Slice in his biopic. Finally, there’s Walking Dead star Danai Gurira, who played Okoye in Black Panther. She has now landed one of the lead roles in Godzilla vs Kong (5/22/2020), which will be the fourth film in Warner Bros’ monster cinematic universe, after next year’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters (5/31/2019). (We also saw our first image from that film this week.)5. INSPIRING THAI CAVE RESCUE INSPIRES TWO DUELLING MOVIES(Photo by Sam Panthaky/Getty Images)The world watched in anticipation and dread as a junior football team became trapped deep inside a cave in Thailand in June of this year&nbsp;until they were eventually rescued this week. Within hours of their rescue, PureFlix, the production company of religious films like God’s Not Dead was already in Thailand researching the area for a planned film, and looking into securing film rights to the survivors’ stories. PureFlix is reportedly looking at budgeting their film in the $30-$60 million range, but they’re also going to have competition. Citing concerns about “whitewashing” of what is obviously an Asian story, Crazy Rich Asians director Jon M. Chu is also now developing his own adaptation of the Thai cave rescue story. Jon M. Chu took to Twitter to say, “I refuse to let Hollywood #whitewashout the Thai Cave rescue story! No way. Not on our watch. That won’t happen or we’ll give them hell.” Chu and Ivanhoe Pictures are also in negotiations with Thailand’s Navy for the rights to a film. Meanwhile, as The Wrap reports, Scarlett Johansson also inadvertently found herself involved in this still-evolving story.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4.&nbsp;WILL KELLY CLARKSON HELP MAKE&nbsp;UGLYDOLLS&nbsp;A HIT?(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Following the box office success of 2016’s Trolls ($153 million domestic, $346 million globally), other&nbsp;similar franchises have also gotten closer to having their own movies. One&nbsp;example is Uglydoll, the line of plush dolls which variably resemble characters from Monsters Inc, Monsters vs Aliens, or Futurama (in this writer’s opinion). STXfilms is far enough along in producing the Uglydolls movie that they’ve been able to schedule it for&nbsp;just 10 months from now (5/10/19), and in March, we learned that Pitbull would be voicing one of the monsters. This week, we learned that former American Idol winner (and current The Voice judge) Kelly Clarkson will also be voicing a character named Moxy. Uglydolls is being directed by Kelly Asbury, who is coming off two Rotten animated films: Gnomeo and Juliet (56%) and Smurfs: The Lost Village (38%). Other films scheduled against Uglydolls on May 10, 2019 are the Dirty Rotten Scoundrels remake called The Hustle and, most significantly, the live-action Pokemon movie Detective Pikachu.3. JOAQUIN PHOENIX’S JOKER ORIGIN MOVIE STARTS FILMING THIS FALL(Photo by Warner Bros.)We may yet someday see the solo Joker movie starring Jared Leto, reprising his role from Suicide Squad, but it looks like the one we’re going to see in theaters before that happens is a completely different one. Joaquin Phoenix is attached to star in a “Joker origin story”&nbsp;that is part of a new slate of DC Comics movies not set in the “DCEU” of Justice League, Suicide Squad, etc. Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker movie has officially received a greenlight for filming to start in late 2018 on a relatively low budget of just $55 million&nbsp;Compared, for example, to the reported $162 million budget&nbsp;for Marvel’s Ant-Man and the Wasp.) There is no release date yet for Phoenix’s Joker origin movie, but there is talk it could be as soon as late 2019 (with sometime in 2020 most likely). The film will&nbsp;be directed by Todd Phillips, who is coming off a four-movie Rotten streak (Due Date, The Hangover Part II, The Hangover Part III, War Dogs), which is why this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas. You can read some of Joaquin Phoenix’s thoughts on playing the Joker right here. In other DC Comics movie news, we got our first glimpse at Shazam!&nbsp;this week, and also learned that Djimon Hounsou will be playing the Wizard who grants Shazam! his powers.2.&nbsp;JEREMY RENNER: FROM HAWKEYE TO SPAWN(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Everyone who likes Marvel movies probably has their own favorite member of the Avengers, but if yours is Hawkeye, Avengers: Infinity War was probably disappointing (rumor is, though, that he will have a much bigger role in Avengers 4), and like many of the “original” Avengers stars, Jeremy Renner may be close to the end of his run. This week, Renner signed on for a different movie based on a popular comic book (in the 1990s, at least), and it’s Spawn. Detective Twitch Williams is a Spawn character who did not appear in the original 1997 movie, but that’s exactly who Jeremy Renner will be playing. Renner joins Jamie Foxx, who is taking over from Michael Jai White as the titular Spawn, a cloak-clad anti-hero who receives his powers from one of the rulers of Hell. The original Spawn received a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 18%.1. YOUR MOVE, CREEP: ROBOCOP RETURNS(Photo by Columbia Pictures)There are people in Hollywood who just won’t let 1980s action franchises fade gently into our collective memory. Instead, we continue to get new entries in franchises like The Predator (9/14/2018),&nbsp;Terminator (11/22/2019), and until last last year, Alien. These reboots sometimes happen despite suggestions that audiences aren’t necessarily&nbsp;on board for them any more. Take, for example, the 2014 reboot of RoboCop, which was a relative box office disappointment with just $58 million domestically from a production budget of $100 million. MGM is still going back to the RoboCop well, however, with the news this week that they are now developing a new film&nbsp;called RoboCop Returns. It’s not yet clear whether Joel Kinnaman will “return” in RoboCop Returns, or if MGM will look for a new star. RoboCop Returns will be directed by Neill Blomkamp (Chappie, Elysium, District 9), who also at one point was working on his own Alien sequel. Some writers see Blomkamp directing RoboCop Returns as redemption for the director, but this writer would much rather just see him directing his own original material.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Elton, awards, king, Pixar","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/13165545/Billy-Dee-Williams-Star-Wars-2018.jpg","slug":"billy-dee-williams-will-return-for-star-wars-episode-ix-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509180955956","title":"Henry Cavill May No Longer Be Superman, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Henry Cavill May No Longer Be Superman, and More Movie NewsSteven Soderbergh moves to Netflix, Jordan Peele to produce Candyman, biopics for Harriet Tubman and Ol' Dirty Bastard, and Halle Berry directs.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 14, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as The Batman, Supergirl, and biopics about Harriet Tubman and Ol’ Dirty Bastard.This WEEK’S TOP STORYHENRY CAVILL LIKELY OUT AS SUPERMAN, SIGNALLING BIG DCEU CHANGES(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)The DC Comics Extended Universe hit a major detour sign this week, but to put things into context, let’s start with Warner Bros.’ big announcement in October, 2014, which will be four years ago next month. As a reaction to the continued success of Marvel Studios’ films, Warner Bros. announced an ambitious ten movie slate, which was to have included two Justice League movies and a Man of Steel 2. Warner Bros. is still very much committed to making DC Comics movies, but we now know that they’re going to be doing it, likely, without the involvement of Henry Cavill as Superman. Instead, the focus in the “Superman Family” will be on his cousin, Supergirl, whom we learned last month is getting her own movie. We should note that some sources were sure to emphasize the “likely” in their reporting, but most seemed certain about it. The talks with Cavill reportedly broke down over a Superman cameo in next year’s Shazam! (4/5/2019). Cavill himself added a “bizarre” footnote to the news on Instagram, where he posted a video of himself holding a Superman action figure. Warner Bros.’ upcoming DC projects include Aquaman (12/21/2018), Shazam! (4/5/2019), Wonder Woman 1984 (11/1/2019), Margot Robbie’s Birds of Prey (filming in January), and The Flash (filming in March). Many pieces went online&nbsp;speculating about the future of DC Comics movies.&nbsp;There also quickly emerged an update that suggests one of the actors who might be in the mix&nbsp;to replace Cavill&nbsp; is Black Panther and Fantastic Four co-star Michael B. Jordan. Peter Dinklage and Elle Fanning also suggested that their I Think We’re Alone Now director, Reed Morano, should be hired to direct Supergirl.&nbsp; Henry Cavill is expected to keep very busy anyway, as he recently signed with Netflix to star&nbsp;in their video game adaptation series, The Witcher.Fresh Developments1. STEVEN SODERBERGH’S NEXT FLYING HIGH AT NETFLIX(Photo by Claudette Barius/Relativity Media)Even the most acclaimed directors obviously occasionally have missteps, but Steven Soderbergh is currently enjoying a streak of seven&nbsp;Certified Fresh films, dating back to 2011’s Contagion, and since then, also including Magic Mike, Behind the Candelabra, and this year’s Unsane. For his next film, Soderbergh is making a move to Netflix, who has acquired the rights to his sports drama called High Flying Bird. The cast includes Andre Holland (the adult Kevin from Moonlight and star of Hulu’s&nbsp;Castle Rock), Zazie Beetz (Domino from Deadpool 2 and co-star of FX’s&nbsp;Atlanta), Star Trek star Zachary Quinto, and Kyle MacLachlan. Holland stars in the drama, set during an NBA lockout, as a sports agent who “pitches a rookie basketball client (Melvin Gregg) on an intriguing and controversial business proposition.” High Flying Bird was shot, like Unsane, using an IPhone camera, and will be on Netflix next year.2. JORDAN PEELE PRODUCING CANDYMAN REMAKE(Photo by Justin Lubin/Universal Pictures)Jordan Peele may have started as half of the comedy team Key &amp; Peele with Keegan-Michael Key, but with last year’s Get Out, he’s quickly developing a second career as a director and producer of thrillers and/or horror films. Peele is currently filming a “social horror-thriller” called simply Us (starring Lupita Nyong’o, Elisabeth Moss, and Winston Duke), but is also apparently preparing for his future&nbsp;as well. One of those possible projects is a remake of the 1992 horror film Candyman, which Peele is producing through his Monkeypaw Productions (and&nbsp;which he may also possibly direct). Candyman was followed in 1994 and 1999 by two sequels, both of which received Rotten Tomatometer scores (25% and 13%). Tony Todd isn’t expected to reprise the title role for this remake. Jordan Peele also recently produced Spike Lee’s&nbsp;BlacKkKlansman, and Us is scheduled for release on March 15, 2019 (one week after Captain Marvel).3.&nbsp;HARRIET TUBMAN BIOPIC MOVING FORWARD AT FOCUS FEATURES(Photo by Eli Winston/Everett Collection)About a year and a half ago, we first heard that Tony Award-winner Cynthia Erivo had signed to star in a biopic about Underground Railroad leader Harriet Tubman. We can now report that the film, to be called simply Harriet, has been picked up for distribution by Focus Features, likely for an awards season run in late 2019. Harriet will be directed by Kasi Lemmons (Talk to Me, Eve’s Bayou), who also co-wrote the film with Gregory Allen Howard (Remember the Titans). Cynthia Erivo will be joined in Harriet by Leslie Odom Jr. (Red Tails), Joe Alwyn (Operation Finale), Jennifer Nettles (Dolly Parton’s Coat of Many Colors), and Clarke Peters, although their roles aren’t yet known.4. WITH AFFLECK LIKELY OUT, THE BATMAN RUMORS INCLUDE TWO JONS (SNOW AND HAMM)(Photo by Priscilla Grant, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)The big DC Comics movie news this week was about Henry Cavill’s departure as Superman. That news, however, follows three months on the heels of suggestions that Ben Affleck is also unlikely to star in the solo film The Batman (and here are some of the reasons why). The screenplay by writer/director Matt Reeves (War for the Planet of the Apes, Let Me In) reportedly focuses on a younger Batman (in sharp contrast to Affleck’s portrayal as a veteran hero). So, if The Batman is going to go younger, who might that be? One rumor that emerged this week concerned Kit Harington, who recently wrapped his series run as Jon Snow on the final season of Game of Thrones. Harrington’s representative quickly debunked that rumor. (This piece suggests other possibilities.) Another actor who threw his name into the mix this week (while also acknowledging that there have been zero talks) was Mad Men star Jon Hamm. One reason not to believe Hamm (b. 1971) would be cast is that he’s actually a year older than Affleck (b. 1972).5. MARK RUFFALO REVEALS THE AVENGERS 4 ENDING HASN’T YET BEEN FILMED(Photo by Marvel Studios)Even as the final moments of Avengers: Infinity War left us all wide-eyed and wondering what comes next, the safe presumption probably would have been that the various stars knew, since Avengers 4 was filmed concurrently with Avengers: Infinity War. This week, we learned via Mark Rufallo (A.K.A. the Hulk) that that isn’t necessarily true. Ruffalo revealed that he and other Avengers stars will soon return for the second half of filming of Avengers 4, which will include both reshoots and the actual filming of the ending, which we now know hadn’t actually been done yet. Avengers 4 is scheduled for release on May 3, 2019, which means we have fewer than 8 months to learn what the title of the movie actually will be. This also means that Avengers 4 will probably wrap filming after Spider-Man: Far From Home, which opens in theaters two months later (July 5, 2019).6.&nbsp;BREAKING BAD CO-STAR JOINS GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S SCARY STORIES TO TELL IN THE DARK(Photo by James Atoa/Everett Collection)Guillermo del Toro hasn’t yet announced his next film as director after the recent Academy Award winner The Shape of Water, but we do know he’s staying busy.&nbsp;He set up a new production company at Fox Searchlight&nbsp;and&nbsp;became producer on CBS Films’ adaptation of the popular children’s book series Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. To date, the casting focus of&nbsp;Scar Stories has been on the film’s young stars, but this week, they were joined by a veteran actor best known for his work as Hank on Breaking Bad, and two others. TV stars Dean Norris (Breaking Bad, Under the Dome), Gil Bellows (Ally McBeal), and Lorraine Toussaint (Orange in the New Black) have all joined the cast of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. Although Guillermo del Toro isn’t directing himself, he did hire Norwegian director André Øvredal, who gave us the innovative 2010 monster movie Trollhunter.7.&nbsp;RZA PRODUCING BIOPIC FOR WU-TANG CLAN’S OL’ DIRTY BASTARD(Photo by Bob Berg/Getty Images)Here’s a number that might make Gen X rap fans feel old: Ol’ Dirty Bastard (AKA&nbsp; Russell Tyrone Jones) of the Wu-Tang Clan died 14&nbsp;years ago, in 2004. ODB’s Wu-Tang&nbsp; leader and producer&nbsp;RZA, who previously directed the martial arts movie The Man with the Iron Fists, is now working to keep Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s legacy going, with a new deal at Sony Pictures. RZA is producing a biopic about the life of ODB, whose quick ascendancy to fame with Wu-Tang ended tragically because of a drug overdose in 2004, two days before his 36th birthday. His fame was due in part to his eccentric behavior, which included picking up a welfare check in a limousine and bum-rushing Puff Daddy’s acceptance speech at the 1998 Grammy Awards. It is not yet known who might play Ol’ Dirty Bastard, or who will be hired&nbsp;to direct the project (RZA himself may be a candidate).8.&nbsp;HALLE BERRY MAKING DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH MMA DRAMA BRUISED(Photo by RCF/Everett Collection)As an actress, Halle Berry has had a rough history with the Tomatometer, with only two Fresh scores among her last ten narrative films (those being Cloud Atlas&nbsp;and X-Men: Days of Future Past). Despite that, Berry remains a reliable box office draw, as her last two star vehicles&nbsp;that opened wide, The Call and Kidnap, both earned over $30 million, which, relative to their budgets, made those films very profitable. Halle Berry is now preparing to make her directorial debut with an MMA (mixed martial arts) drama called Bruised, in which she will also star. Berry will play “a disgraced MMA fighter who has to face one of the rising stars of the MMA world and deal with the return of her 6-year-old son to the mother he deserves.” The fight scenes will be choreographed by the same stunt choreographers who worked on the John Wick franchise.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1. WONDER WOMAN CO-STAR MAY NO LONGER BE THE JAMES BOND 25 VILLAIN(Photo by Xavier Laine/Getty Images)This one isn’t so much a “Rotten Idea” as it is a potentially missed opportunity. With director Danny Boyle’s recent departure from the not-yet-titled James Bond 25, the project is apparently in a state of change. Boyle was apparently far enough into preproduction that talks had begun with actors, but with the film delayed, those negotiations may no longer work out. French-American actor Saïd Taghmaoui, who co-starred in Wonder Woman as one of her World War I compatriots, revealed this week that he had been cast as the lead villain in James Bond 25. Taghmaoui said, “the producers don’t know if they’re going to go Russian or Middle East with the baddie right now… I literally just received a message saying: ‘if they go Middle East, it’s you. If they go Russian, it’s someone else.” So, Saïd Taghmaoui may indeed still be a James Bond villain, but this news is still something of a tease at what Danny Boyle’s version of James Bond might have been.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"frames, boxing, Searchlight, 2016","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/14161211/Henry-Cavill-Superman-Out-Ketchup-Rep.jpg","slug":"henry-cavill-may-no-longer-be-superman-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509180961077","title":"First Images of Captain Marvel Released, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})First Images of Captain Marvel Released, and More Movie NewsRian Johnson teams up with Daniel Craig, new roles for Margot Robbie, Chris Evans, Tom Holland, and Colin Farrell; and we say goodbye to Burt Reynolds.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 7, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Captain Marvel, Dune, Wicked, and the Die Hard prequel.This WEEK’S TOP STORYFIRST IMAGES FROM CAPTAIN MARVEL REVEAL COSTUME AND VILLAINS(Photo by Marvel Studios)As of this weekend, Marvel Studios’ next movie, Captain Marvel, will be just six months away from release (March 8th, 2019). Outside of a teaser in the final moments of Avengers: Infinity War, we haven’t&nbsp;seen much from the film starring Brie Larson, but&nbsp;we did get a sneak peek this week when&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly received the exclusive scoop of several first official images. (Collider also has those images in higher resolution.) In addition to showing off two of her costumes (both the red-blue-and-yellow costume and her “Kree soldier” greens), these images also include our first looks at how the evil, shapeshifting alien Skrull race. It’s&nbsp;been a long time coming, as at one point, the Skrulls had been rumored to be featured in 2012’s Marvel’s The Avengers (we got the Chitauri instead). Another character&nbsp;revealed in the photo set is the Kree character played by Jude Law, although Marvel is still not revealing his name (he’s rumored to be Mar-Vell, A.K.A. Marvel’s original Captain Marvel). Co-director Anna Boden also revealed that Captain Marvel will not be an “origin story” as had been speculated, but will instead start with Larson’s Carol Danvers already a member of the Kree military (though&nbsp;it’s still set in the 1990s). As for what the inclusion of the Skrulls in Captain Marvel means for the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, these images are already inspiring new speculation and theories.Fresh Developments1. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE STAR JOINS DUNE REBOOT(Photo by David James/Paramount Pictures)Director Denis Villeneuve is following up his recent science fiction films Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 with another sci-fi film, this time a straight-up reboot/remake. Villeneuve is preparing to start filming his version of Frank Herbert’s Dune in early 2019, which was previously adapted as both the 1984 David Lynch film (Rotten at 55%), and a 2000 Sci Fi Channel miniseries. Villeneuve started casting with Timothee Chalamet (Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name) as Paul Atreides, and for his second decision, he’s cast Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica. Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson is probably best known for her role in recent Mission: Impossible films (including this year’s Fallout), and with Dune, she has a chance at yet another major franchise (she’s also going to be in the Men in Black spinoff and the Shining sequel Doctor Sleep). There have been reports in the past that Denis Villeneuve’s plans for Dune may involve splitting Herbert’s original novel into two movies, but for now, it’s just called Dune (and not, say “Dune Part One“).2. STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI DIRECTOR PULLS HIS KNIVES OUT ON DANIEL CRAIG(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Since the relatively disappointing box office of Solo: A Star Wars Story, Lucasfilm appears to be focusing its energies after next year’s Star Wars Episode IX on new sets of trilogies (including one from the Game of Thrones showrunners). The other major trilogy we know about is from Rian Johnson, the director of last year’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi. That said, it’s still going to be a while before Johnson’s trilogy is&nbsp;ready to be filmed, allowing him time for at least one movie in the meantime. That movie will likely be called Knives Out, and for his star, Johnson is borrowing from another long-running action movie franchise. Daniel Craig has some extra time while James Bond 25 is on temporarily hold following the departure of director Danny Boyle, so he’s now free to start filming Knives Out in November. The premise&nbsp;hasn’t been revealed, except that it’s “a modern day murder mystery in the classic whodunit style.” Meanwhile, the director shortlist for Bond 25 reportedly includes Bart Layton (American Animals), Yann Demange (the upcoming White Boy Rick), and S.J. Clarkson, who is attached to direct the also-upcoming Star Trek 4.3. MARGOT ROBBIE TO STAR AS HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR IN RUIN(Photo by Frank Masi/Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Though he’s not a household name, Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts scored prominent billing opposite Jennifer Lawrence in Red Sparrow earlier this year. His star may rise, though,&nbsp;if he keeps landing choice roles opposite popular actresses. As it happens, Schoenaerts is now attached to star alongside Oscar-nominated Margot Robbie in a historical drama&nbsp;called Ruin, based on a screenplay&nbsp;that was the top choice in last year’s Black List of Unproduced Screenplays. Robbie will play a Holocaust survivor in post-World War II Germany who is forced to unite with a former SS captain (Schoenaerts) as part of her mission to exact revenge on the surviving members of a Nazi death squad. Robbie’s other upcoming films include&nbsp;Mary Queen of Scots (as Queen Elizabeth I), Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (as Sharon Tate), and Birds of Prey (as DC Comics’ Harley Quinn).4. CAPTAIN AMERICA, SPIDER-MAN, AND THE DEVIL ALL THE TIME(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Marvel Studios has had so many successful movies at this point that it’s increasingly inevitable that other films will&nbsp;star&nbsp;one or more&nbsp;of the MCU’s big names. This week, for example, we learned of&nbsp;a new film&nbsp;that will feature Marvel’s Captain America and Spider-Man. Chris Evans, Tom Holland, Tracy Letts (Lady Bird), Robert Pattinson (Twilight), and Mia Wasikowska (Disney’s Alice in Wonderland) have all been cast in an indie drama&nbsp;called The Devil All the Time. (Another Marvel connection is that Letts’ wife Carrie Coon costarred in Avengers: Infinity War as the villainous Proxima Midnight.) Director Antonio Campos (Christine, Simon Killer) is adapting The Devil All the Time&nbsp;from a 2011 novel by Donald Ray Pollock. The premise involves “a demented team of serial killers, a spider-eating preacher, and a corrupt local sheriff.” Antonio Campos is also attached to direct a prequel to the classic Satanic thriller The Omen for 20th Century Fox.5. COMMON AND COLIN FARRELL JOIN JESSICA CHASTAIN’S EVE(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Sometimes, when a director needs to leave a film (for any reason), it can set the project back by months, years, or sometimes, for forever. (See, for example, the aforementioned James Bond 25.) Jessica Chastain’s assassin action movie Eve appears to be a rare example of a film that is adjusting to a new director so quickly that filming is proceeding pretty much exactly on time as originally planned. Just under a month ago, director Matthew Newton departed Eve following #metoo allegations, and was subsequently replaced by Tate Taylor, who worked with Chastain on The Help. This week, Chastain was joined by Colin Farrell and rapper-turned-actor Common, who will play, respectively, a member of Chastain’s black ops organization and her character’s former fiance.6.&nbsp;GEMMA ARTERTON TO PLAY DUSTY SPRINGFIELD&nbsp;IN BIOPICWe’re still waiting on the long-in-development biopics for such 1960s pop stars as Janis Joplin, Sammy Davis Jr, and Marvin Gaye, but this week, one of their contemporaries received news of her own movie. British singer Dusty Springfield (A.K.A. Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O’Brien) is probably best known for the song “Son of a Preacher Man,” but her hits also included “Wishin’ and Hopin'” and “I Only Want to Be With You.” Gemma Arterton, whose Hollywood projects have included Quantum of Solace, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, and Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, has signed on to star as Dusty Springfield in a historical drama called So Much Love. Not strictly a true “biopic,” So Much Love will focus on the year 1968, when Springfield traveled to Memphis to record her album Dusty in Memphis. So Much Love will be directed by screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, who received an Academy Award nomination for 2016’s Carol. The film’s producers are comparing So Much Love to La Vie En Rose (about Edith Piaf) and Walk the Line (about Johnny Cash and June Carter).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. FEATURE ADAPTATION OF&nbsp;WICKED&nbsp;DELAYEDFor the last year or two, Universal Pictures has kept their long-in-development adaptation of the hit musical Wicked scheduled for release next year, on December 20th, 2019. As we enter the last months of 2018, however, that date has seemed&nbsp;more and more questionable, and Universal has not yet started production on what will presumably be a big budget musical extravaganza. Another long-brewing musical adaptation started making the news recently, as the Cats&nbsp;movie is finally getting made, featuring a cast of live action actors and singers that includes James Corden, Sir Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift, and to sing the most famous song, “Memory,” Jennifer Hudson. Putting those two threads together, Universal announced this week that it will instead be Cats&nbsp;that will be released on December 20th, 2019, in a move that also allows Wicked more development time. Universal has not yet announced a new release date for Wicked, and they have still not officially announced any cast for Wicked. The two singers most famously associated with Wicked are Frozen star Idina Menzel (as Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West), and Kristin Chenoweth (who played Glinda the “Good” Witch).2. THE LATE BURT REYNOLDS HADN’T YET FILMED HIS ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD SCENES(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)Yesterday, Burt Reynolds, who was one of Hollywood’s biggest movie stars during the height of his career in the 1970s and early 1980s, died at the age of 82 after years of heart-related conditions. Despite his health issues, Reynolds remained active right up until the end, including signing on with Quentin Tarantino to co-star in next year’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as real life figure George Spahn, who owned the infamous ranch where Charles Manson and his “Family” lived while planning their crimes. Within hours of Reynolds’ death, it was revealed that he had not yet had the opportunity to film his scenes for the film.&nbsp;It’s not known if Tarantino will recast the role of George Spahn (Bruce Dern, perhaps?), or if he will leave the character out of the film entirely now. Variety also ran an interesting piece yesterday that&nbsp;listed some of the more famous roles Reynolds “turned down” during his career, including Han Solo, James Bond, Die Hard, Pretty Woman, and two of the films for which Jack Nicholson won Academy Awards. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, starring Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, Al Pacino and many, many more is scheduled for release on July 26, 2019.1. DIE HARD ORIGIN MOVIE MOVING FORWARD(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Although 2007’s Live Free or Die Hard was Certified Fresh at 82%, when&nbsp;A Good Day to Die Hard came out six years later, the franchise took a steep dive at 14%. Good Day&nbsp;was also a box office disappointment, with the lowest totals of the franchise (especially when you adjust for inflation, ouch). Even so, 20th Century Fox is developing a sixth Die Hard movie, which will be a 1970s-set “origin story” for John McClane. Up until this week, the prequel was known as&nbsp;Die Hard: Year One, but we now know that Fox has&nbsp;removed the words “Die” and “Hard”&nbsp;from the title. Instead, the origin movie is now called McClane. It’s not yet known who will be cast as the young John McClane.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Dead, San, video, historical, ABC, Nickelodeon, Rocky, AMC, Election, Fox, Rocketman, drama, films, frames, Dark","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/07161046/Captain-Marvel-Ketchup-Rep.jpg","slug":"first-images-of-captain-marvel-released-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509180969274","title":"Andy Serkis’ Mowgli Acquired by Netflix and Rescheduled for 2019, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Andy Serkis' Mowgli Acquired by Netflix and Rescheduled for 2019, and More Movie NewsNicole Kidman, Charlize Theron, and Margot Robbie join forces; Peter Dinklage does Rumpelstiltskin; Ben Affleck and Matt Damon reunite; and The Sandlot gets a prequel.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 3, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Fantasy Island, Kraven the Hunter, Rumpelstiltskin, and DC’s Super Pets.This WEEK’S TOP STORYNETFLIX PICKS UP ANDY SERKIS’&nbsp;MOWGLI AND UPCOMING&nbsp;ANIMAL FARM(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)After starring as Gollum in Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings movies, as Jackson’s King Kong, and as Caesar in the recent Planet of the Apes trilogy, actor Andy Serkis has been working on becoming a director in his own right. He made his directorial debut last year with the quiet biopic Breathe, but that was only because the film that would’ve otherwise been his debut was held back. That film is&nbsp;Mowgli (previously Jungle Book: Origins), and the reason for its delay appears to have been the success of Disney’s The Jungle Book, which was actually produced in relative conjunction with Serkis’ film. Mowgli also has an impressive cast, including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Serkis himself, but Warner Bros. had been bouncing it around the release calendar since October 2016, and until this week, it&nbsp;was scheduled for 10/19/18. Instead, Netflix has swooped in as a savior for not only&nbsp;Mowgli&nbsp;but also Serkis’ long-planned adaptation of George Orwell’s Animal Farm. Mowgli will now debut on Netflix in 2019,&nbsp;though Netflix also&nbsp;remains committed to a 3D theatrical release (since that’s how Andy Serkis actually filmed it). Netflix’s action to “save” Mowgli is already being touted as another example of how the streaming juggernaut is changing&nbsp;the industry, and their commitment to support Serkis’ Animal Farm also likely means that he won’t have to struggle with release date expectations on that film.&nbsp;The voice cast for Animal Farm&nbsp;has not yet been announced.Fresh Developments1. STAR WARS: EPISODE IX CAST ANNOUNCED, INCLUDING THE LATE CARRIE FISHER(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Director J.J. Abrams (LOST, Star Trek, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) and his cast and crew officially began filming&nbsp;Star Wars Episode IX&nbsp;this week. This announcement also came with an official cast list&nbsp;that&nbsp;included many of the names you’d expect, plus confirmation that the late Carrie Fisher (1956-2016) will appear as General Leia Organa via&nbsp;“unused” footage from the production of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Keri Russell (who starred in J.J. Abrams’ TV series&nbsp;Felicity) was not included in that list, but her previously reported participation was quickly confirmed. Richard E. Grant (Withnail and I, Gosford Park) is also joining the Star Wars universe with Episode IX, while Billy Dee Williams&nbsp;will&nbsp;reprise his&nbsp;role&nbsp;as Lando Calrissian. The usage of Carrie Fisher footage has received the approval of her brother Todd Fisher, and Mark Hamill has said that, “it’s bittersweet facing my final chapter without her.” Star Wars: Episode IX is scheduled for release on December 20, 2019, bringing the franchise back to the month where Lucasfilm previously had better success than with Solo: A Star Wars Story when it was released in May this year.2. NICOLE KIDMAN, CHARLIZE THERON, AND&nbsp;MARGOT ROBBIE&nbsp;ARE FAIR AND BALANCED(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Dee Cercone, Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection)After directing similar politically charged true story dramas like Game Change and Recount for HBO, director Jay Roach is returning to the big screen with Fair and Balanced, about the sexual harassment charges against Fox News chief Roger Ailes, and he’s filling out his cast with acclaimed A-listers. The first&nbsp;lead cast was Charlize Theron (Best Actress winner for Monster; nominated for North Country) as Megyn Kelly (now of NBC’s The Today Show). For Gretchen Carlson, whose departure from FOX News was sort of “the beginning of the end,”&nbsp;Roach has cast Nicole Kidman (Best Actress winner for The Hours; four time nominee for&nbsp;Moulin Rouge, Rabbit Hole, and Lion). Finally, Margot Robbie (nominated this year for Best Actress for&nbsp;I, Tonya)&nbsp;is also up for a role as a fictional associate producer who appears to be a composite character representing still-anonymous FOX employees.&nbsp;The film’s most major role yet to be cast is Roger Ailes himself, but male network hosts Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity are also expected to be characters.3. DC COMICS TO GET ANOTHER FUN ANIMATED MOVIE IN SUPER PETS &nbsp;Following the (relatively) disappointing returns for movies like Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, Warner Bros. and DC Comics are moving past the Zack Snyder era in&nbsp;favor of a new platform of more fun and colorful movies. At their SDCC panel last month, DC showed off three such films: Aquaman (12/21/2018), Shazam! (4/5/2019), and Wonder Woman 1984 (11/1/2019), and just last weekend, they released the shiny animated&nbsp;comedy&nbsp;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies (Fresh at 90%). Live action movies take longer to develop and produce, so Warner Bros. appears to be doubling down on supplementing their slate with more animated fare.&nbsp;The studio has hired screenwriter Jared Stern (The LEGO Batman Movie, The LEGO Ninjago Movie) to adapt an animated feature&nbsp;based on Super Pets, or as it’s known in the comics, Legion of Super Pets. First introduced in 1962, this group has been comprised of various animal sidekicks to DC superheroes like Superman (who’s had the biggest stable with Krypto the Super-Dog, Streaky the Super-Cat, Comet the Super-Horse, and Beppo the Super-Monkey). Marvel has their own take on this with Pet Avengers, but it appears that DC’s Super Pets might beat Marvel to the big screen on this one.4.&nbsp;PETER DINKLAGE TO FOLLOW GAME OF THRONES WITH FAIRY TALE RUMPELSTILTSKIN(Photo by HBO)The cast and crew of HBO’s Game of Thrones celebrated their series wrap recently, which also means that the show’s extensive cast is now going to be looking for work. We can expect to see Game of Thrones stars&nbsp;in casting news for the rest of this year, but the latest&nbsp;to make headlines is Peter Dinklage, who plays fan-favorite Tyrion Lannister. Dinklage is working with Sony Pictures to produce and star in their adaptation of Rumpelstiltskin, based on the story by the Brothers Grimm. Screenwriter Patrick Ness, who made his film debut with 2016’s A Monster Calls (Certified Fresh at 86%), has been hired to&nbsp;adapt the classic Grimm story about an imp capable of spinning straw into gold who makes dark deals in a fantastical setting full of royal intrigue. In other words, he’s sort of&nbsp;treading back into Tyrion Lannister territory already.5.&nbsp;JESSICA CHASTAIN PRODUCING AND STARRING IN ASSASSIN ACTION MOVIE EVE(Photo by Richard Foreman Jr/Weinstein Company)Keanu Reeves’ action movie John Wick only came out four years ago this October, but it has already inspired something of a wave of similar action movies, especially with a female protagonists, like Atomic Blonde, Proud Mary, Red Sparrow, and the upcoming Jennifer Garner film Peppermint. Jessica Chastain (Interstellar, Zero Dark Thirty), who is currently filming IT: Chapter Two, is jumping on that bandwagon with an action movie of her own called&nbsp;Eve, in which she will star (and also produce under her company Freckle Films). Eve will be written and directed by Matthew Newton, who, to date, has delivered well-received indie films&nbsp;like From Nowhere and Who We Are Now. Eve will tell the story of “a ruthless female assassin… who is hunted by her former employers while trying to tell her family the truth about what she does for a living.” In addition to IT: Chapter Two, Chastain will next be seen in X-Men: Dark Phoenix (2/14/2019).6. BEN AFFLECK AND MATT DAMON ARE REUNITING FOR A TRUE STORY TRIP TO MCDONALD’S(Photo by Sara Cozolino/Everett Collection)One positive side effect of Ben Affleck apparently ending his commitment to&nbsp;DC’s&nbsp;Batman movies is that this will allow him more time to focus on his career as a director. This story really begins, however, with an item that was published on The Daily Beast last week, telling the true story of an ex-cop who rigged the annual&nbsp;Monopoly&nbsp;games given away with purchases at McDonald’s. For twelve years, Jerome Jacobsen won almost every Monopoly prize, until his “luck” finally attracted the attention of the FBI. Hollywood noticed that story and saw the movie possibilities, leading to a studio bidding war ultimately won by 20th Century Fox. The studio also quickly announced that their project came with Ben Affleck attached to direct his old friend, Good Will Hunting&nbsp;co-star and co-writer Matt Damon, attached to star as Jerome Jacobsen. The other studios also had their own talent attached: Universal had Kevin Hart, Warner Bros had Steve Carell, and Netflix had Robert Downey Jr.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3.&nbsp;HOLLYWOOD DOUBLES DOWN ON NOSTALGIA WITH THE SANDLOT, INDECENT PROPOSAL, AND BLIND DATE(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. courtesy Everett Collection)Until recently, it seemed like Hollywood&nbsp;might ease off its obsession with remakes a little bit, but that may have just been a temporary reprieve as the trends moved on from the 1980s to the 1990s. We’ll start, however, with a project that is not a remake at all, but a prequel, namely of&nbsp;the 1993 baseball kids movie The Sandlot. That film’s original writer and director, David Mickey Evans, has made a deal with 20th Century Fox for a new movie that would delve deeper into the backstory of “The Beast,” the English mastiff that terrorized the kids. This Sandlot prequel will actually be the fourth film in the franchise, as there were two direct-to-video sequels in 2005 and 2007. Paramount Players is also now developing a remake of the 1993 drama Indecent Proposal, about a young couple who agree to a financial arrangement in which the wife will spend one night with a millionaire for $1 million. The remake is being written by screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson,&nbsp;who adapted 2016’s The Girl on the Train and is also working on Disney’s live-action remake of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Finally, Sony Pictures is also now developing a remake of the Bruce Willis/Kim Basinger romantic comedy from 1987 called Blind Date.2. SONY MOVES FORWARD WITH ANOTHER SPIDER-MAN SPINOFF: KRAVEN THE HUNTER(Photo by Mark Bagley/Marvel Comics)Earlier this week, Sony Pictures released a new trailer for their Spider-Man spinoff Venom (starring Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams) that put more of a spotlight on the alien symbiote’s twisted sense of humor. Though the studio put the brakes on Silver &amp; Black (the Black Cat and Silver Sable movie) earlier this year,&nbsp;it continues to develop other solo movies for the Spider-Man-related characters that they retain the rights to outside of the films produced by Marvel. Since so many of them were introduced in Spider-Man comics as Peter Parker’s villains, most of them walk that thin line between outright villainy and, at best, sort of bad boy “anti-heroes.” (That’s certainly the case with Venom.) Kraven the Hunter has been mentioned in the past, but this week saw the first real development towards a Kraven movie actually happening.&nbsp; Screenwriter Richard Wenk (The Equalizer, The Equalizer 2; cowriter of The Expendables 2) has been hired to start work on Kraven the Hunter, adapting Marvel’s Russian hunter character who has frequently seen Spider-Man as the ultimate prey. Unfortunately, many of Wenk’s films have received Rotten Tomatometer scores.1. BLUMHOUSE SAYS, MY DEAR GUESTS, WELCOME TO THE FANTASY ISLAND MOVIE(Photo by Columbia TriStar courtesy Everett Collection)ABC’s Fantasy Island, which ran for 7 seasons from 1977 to 1984, arguably left an indelible mark on the memories of Generation X (including sort of inspiring elements of ABC’s LOST), but it has evaded (successful) attempts at revivals since then (a 1998 remake was cancelled after just 13 episodes). The original show offered a loose framework for stories about wish fulfillment (often leading the guest characters to realize they were happier without them), but it definitely wasn’t what one would consider horror. The Fantasy Island movie, however, might be darker, because it’s going to be produced by Blumhouse, the production company behind such films and franchises as Insidious, The Purge,&nbsp;Get Out, Happy Death Day, and Split. Blumhouse’s Fantasy Island movie will be directed by Jeff Wadlow, who’s previous films have included Kick-Ass 2 (Rotten at 33%) and Blumhouse’s Truth or Dare (Rotten at 14%). In somewhat related news, Peter Dinklage recently filmed an HBO movie called My Dinner with Herve, in which he played Fantasy Island co-star Hervé Villechaize. Might Dinklage also costar as Tattoo in the&nbsp; Fantasy Island movie?","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Awards, ghosts, renewed, joker, Out, scary, TBS, History, ABC, Fresh, independent","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/03170921/Andy-Serkis-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"andy-serkis-mowgli-acquired-by-netflix-and-rescheduled-for-2019-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509184490828","title":"Fox’s X-Men: Dark Phoenix and The New Mutants Pushed Back to 2019, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Fox's X-Men: Dark Phoenix and The New Mutants Pushed Back to 2019, and More Movie NewsFamiliar faces join Captain Marvel, and new roles for Tiffany Haddish, Scarlett Johannson, Kumail Nanjiani, Amy Adams, and Hugh Jackman, among others.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 30, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as&nbsp;Captain Marvel, Carmen Sandiego, The LEGO Movie 2, and ROM: Spaceknight.This WEEK’S TOP STORYX-MEN: DARK PHOENIX AND THE NEW MUTANTS BOTH PUSHED BACK FROM 2018 TO 2019(Photo by 20th Century Fox)If you went to any big “genre” type movies (like Justice League, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and Thor: Ragnarok) late last year, there is a very good chance that you saw the trailer for the X-Men teen horror movie spinoff The New Mutants (possibly to some confusion if you’re not familiar with the 1980s comics). In the original plan, The New Mutants was to have come out in two weeks from now (4/13/18), but in January, The New Mutants was pushed back to February of 2019. Meanwhile, the main franchise was to have continued this November with X-Men: Dark Phoenix (which we have not seen a trailer for yet). X-Men: Dark Phoenix, which promises to be a “space opera,” has now been pushed back to 2019, a move which also pushed The New Mutants back a second time, this time all the way to August 2nd, 2019 (16 months after its original target). Reportedly, the reason for even more delay for The New Mutants are significant reshoots to emphasize the horror elements (and also to add a mysterious new character to be played by Antonio Banderas). The move of X-Men: Dark Phoenix to Valentine’s Day, 2019 also now allows Fox to bump up their Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody from Christmas Day to November 2nd, 2018.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;CAPTAIN MARVEL CAST REVEALS MORE MCU CHARACTERS(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)We’ve known for a while that next year’s Captain Marvel (3/8/19) would essentially be the MCU’s first prequel, as it would show Brie Larson’s title character confronting the Kree and Skrulls back in the 1990s. At first, however, the only other character that we heard would be featured was Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury (before the eyepatch, even). This week, production finally started on Captain Marvel, and alongside that news came confirmation of three more actors who will be reprising their roles from earlier Marvel Studios films. Clark Gregg will play the much younger Phil Coulson (no word yet on whether he’ll have a lot more hair), who in Iron Man had said, “this isn’t my first rodeo.” Lee Pace and Djimon Hounsou will also return from Guardians of the Galaxy as their Kree characters Ronan the Accuser and Korath the Pursuer. You can read more commentary about these casting reprisals here, and also about how Captain Marvel connects to the Kree and Skrulls here.2. TIFFANY HADDISH TO VOICE NEW LEAD MINIFIGURE IN THE LEGO MOVIE 2(Photo by Michele K. Short/Universal Pictures)The LEGO Movie was such a big surprise hit in early 2014 ($257 million domestically, $469 million worldwide) that Warner Bros Animation quickly started developing a new LEGO movie franchise. Warner Bros may have crammed too many LEGO pieces onto the big screen last year, however. The (relatively) disappointing box office of The LEGO Batman Movie ($175 million) was followed in October by The LEGO Ninjago Movie, which couldn’t even crack $60 million. Since then, there’s been some indication that Warner Bros is slowing down their LEGO spinoff franchise plans, but the proper LEGO Movie 2 sequel is still very much on its way. The first newly announced voice cast member is Girls Trip star Tiffany Haddish, who will be joining returning voice cast members&nbsp; Chris Pratt (Emmet), Elizabeth Banks (Wyldstyle), Will Arnett (Batman), Channing Tatum (Superman), and Jonah Hill (Green Lantern). The premise of The LEGO Movie 2 isn’t yet known, but it sounds like it might have an emphasis on the LEGO Justice League. Warner Bros has scheduled The LEGO Movie 2 for February 8, 2019, against the comedy Flarsky, starring Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron.3. KUMAIL NANJIANI, MARK RUFFALO, AND AMY ADAMS HEADLINE POST-9/11 DRAMA THE TRUE AMERICAN(Photo by Nicole Rivelli/Lionsgate)Four days after the attacks of September 11th, 2001, a white supremacist named Mark Stroman went on a shooting spree in Dallas, killing two and half-blinding a third man, Rais Bhuiyan. Texas is a capital punishment state, but Rais Bhuiyan led the effort to stay Stroman’s execution, citing his own religious beliefs, and the story was adapted in the 2014 book The True American: Murder and Mercy in Texas by Anand Giridharadas. The Big Sick and Silicon Valley star Kumail Nanjiani and Mark Ruffalo are now in talks to star in The True American as Bhuiyan and Stroman, respectively, with Amy Adams also in talks for an unknown role. Amazon Studios is in talks to distribute The True American, which will be directed by Pablo Larrain (Jackie, Neruda), who’s replacing Kathryn Bigelow. (While Bigelow was developing The True American, Tom Hardy had previously been in talks to play Mark Stroman.)4. GINA RODRIGUEZ KNOWS WHERE IN THE WORLD NETFLIX’S CARMEN SANDIEGO&nbsp;IS(Photo by John Castillo/Indomina Releasing)Over the last several years, there have been various attempts to adapt the long-running TV and video game franchise Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?&nbsp;for the big screen (typically with mentions of Jennifer Lopez). Well, we’re finally going to get a Carmen Sandiego movie, but all of the details are now pretty much completely different. For one thing, the title will just be Carmen Sandiego, and it’s now a Netflix production. Gina Rodriguez (Annihilation, TV’s Jane the Virgin) had already been cast as the voice of the character in Netflix’s upcoming animated Carmen Sandiego, and now she’s also going to be the live-action Carmen Sandiego as well. This week, Rodriguez also signed&nbsp;to co-star in an untitled heist movie directed by Miranda July (Me and You and Everyone We Know), alongside costars Evan Rachel Wood, Richard Jenkins, and Debra Winger.5. SCARLETT JOHANSSON JOINS&nbsp;TAIKA WAITITI’S HITLER COMEDY JOJO RABBIT(Photo by Daniel McFadden/Relativity Media)Two weeks ago, we declared a movie called Jojo Rabbit the “Rotten Idea of the Week.” Our reasoning was that the news involved director Taika Waititi (who voiced the rocky warrior Korg in Thor: Ragnarok) playing “an imaginary version of Adolf Hitler” who becomes a young boy’s friend. Despite that controversial premise, what Jojo Rabbit has going for it is Taika Waititi’s Tomatometer record, which&nbsp;boasts four Certified Fresh movies in a row: Boy (2012), What We Do in the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, and Thor: Ragnarok. We’ll give Jojo Rabbit the benefit of the doubt this week as we report that fellow Marvel Studios costar Scarlett Johansson has been cast as the mother of the 10-year-old boy who “is struggling to fit in Nazi-era Germany,” even as the mother herself is hiding a young Jewish girl in their home. The next role to be cast is now expected to be the boy himself (are the Stranger Things kids already too old?).6. IS HUGH JACKMAN GOING TO TEACH US SOME BAD EDUCATION?(Photo by Wilson Webb/Warner Bros.)The P.T. Barnum musical biopic The Greatest Showman, starring Hugh Jackman, never ranked higher than #3 in the box office charts. The film&nbsp;did, however, ultimately demonstrate the continuing appeal of Jackman as its box office math has been “leggier” than Titanic. Jackman’s next film will be The Frontrunner, based on another true story, in which he’ll play scandal-plagued 1988 presidential candidate Gary Hart. After The Frontrunner, Jackman will work with the production company behind La La Land on a high school film called Bad Education, the mystery premise of which is being compared to 1999’s Election.&nbsp;This independent production does not have anything to do with the 2004 Spanish drama Bad Education directed by Pedro Almodovar.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. CLASSIC MARVEL COMICS FAVORITE ROM: SPACEKNIGHT TO GET AN UNRELATED MOVIE(Photo by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images)It might be difficult to imagine now, but there was a time when most of Marvel Comics sales weren’t made off of actual “Marvel” characters. In the late 1970s and early 1980s in particular, many of Marvel’s best-selling comics titles were licensed properties like Star Wars, G.I. Joe, Conan the Barbarian, and some fan favorites (not necessarily top sellers) like Micronauts, Godzilla, and ROM: Spaceknight. (Sean Howe’s 2013 book Marvel Comics: The Untold Story is an excellent source for more on this era.) A few of those were licensed off Hasbro toys, and now in the post-MCU era, Hasbro is attempting to set up new movies for them, but the challenge is that Hasbro and Paramount have to do it on their own, without Marvel. ROM: Spaceknight was never a hugely popular toy, but the comic had a lasting impact on fans. For the ROM: Spaceknight movie, Paramount has hired screenwriter Zak Penn, who also penned this week’s Ready Player One. We’re calling this a borderline “Rotten Idea” mostly because the ideal scenario would be a Paramount/Marvel collaboration on ROM: Spaceknight (but that’s obviously not going to happen… ever).2. ROBERT DOWNEY JR. ANNOUNCES&nbsp;DOCTOR DOLITTLE VOICE CAST(Photo by Claire Folger/Warner Bros.)We still don’t know for certain how many more Marvel movies Robert Downey Jr. will co-star in as Iron Man, but&nbsp;he continues to develop non-Marvel projects on the side. Some of them are still not ready (two of them are Perry Mason and a version of Pinocchio), but one that’s coming next year (4/12/19) is The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle. Unlike the Eddie Murphy remake, this movie is expected to be more faithful to the original early 20th century novels by Hugh Lofting. We’ve known for a while that Downey’s live-action (human) co-stars would include&nbsp;Antonio Banderas, Jim Broadbent, and Michael Sheen, but this week, Downey took to Twitter to reveal his animal voice cast co-stars. Cats will be represented by Ralph Fiennes (a tiger) and Carment Ejogo (a lioness), and other mammals will include John Cena (a polar bear), Marion Cotillard (a fox), Selena Gomez (a giraffe), Tom Holland (a dog), Rami Malek (a gorilla), and Craig Robinson (a mouse). Birds will also be represented, including Kumail Nanjiani (an ostrich), Octavia Spencer (a duck), and Emma Thompson (a parrot). Unfortunately, screenwriter/director Stephen Gaghan is coming off a streak of mostly Rotten films that includes The Alamo (29%), Havoc (45%), and&nbsp;Gold (42%), and just one Fresh score in the last 17 years (2005’s Syriana).1. SEBASTIAN STAN TO REPLACE LEONARDO DICAPRIO IN BEAT THE REAPER(Photo by Marvel Studios)In addition to being a legitimate “movie star,” Leonardo DiCaprio is also a very prolific producer.&nbsp;Back in 2009, it was reported&nbsp;that DiCaprio was producing an adaptation of the novel Beat the Reaper, about a former hitman in the witness protection program who is recognized by a mobster. In 2011, there was then news that DiCaprio&nbsp;thought&nbsp;Beat the Reaper&nbsp;might work better as an HBO series. Now it’s back to being a movie again,&nbsp;except without DiCaprio. Instead, Sebastian Stan (Marvel’s Winter Soldier) will star in Beat the Reaper, which will be directed by Gore Verbinski. 2018 marks the 15th anniversary of the last time a live action feature film directed by Verbinski received a Fresh Tomatometer score. Verbinski’s Rotten films since then have included The Weather Man, two Pirates of the Caribbean sequels, The Lone Ranger, and last year’s A Cure for Wellness.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"free, breaking, Music, Family, Classic, all-time, poppins, docuseries, All, Biopics, marvel, Hulu, Best, song","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/30213302/New-Mutants-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"foxs-x-men-dark-phoenix-and-the-new-mutants-pushed-back-to-2019-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509182700872","title":"A Quiet Place Sequel in the Works, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})A Quiet Place Sequel in the Works, and More Movie NewsDisney triples down on Solo, Chicken Run gets a sequel, and new roles for Hugh Jackman, Zoe Saldana, Patton Oswalt, and IT's Sophia Lillis.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 27, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as The Angry Birds Movie 2, Marvel’s The Eternals, A Quiet Place 2, and The Secret Life of Pets 2.This WEEK’S TOP STORYSHHHH… AUDIENCES WILL GET TO RETURN TO A QUIET PLACE(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer/Paramount)Although Hollywood is obviously&nbsp;fixated on superhero movies (like this week’s Avengers: Infinity War), audiences also continue to show up for horror movies (and thrillers like Get Out). With those genres, the upside is that they’re relatively affordable, budget-wise. Consider A Quiet Place, the silence-themed monster movie made for Paramount on a budget of $17 million&nbsp;that has so far earned $136+ million domestically ($214+ million worldwide), returning to #1 in its third weekend. Paramount Pictures is also very much constantly looking for new franchises, so it’s not surprising that the studio revealed this week that they are moving forward with plans for a sequel to&nbsp;A Quiet Place. The first movie was directed by John Krasinski (who also starred with his wife, Emily Blunt), from a screenplay whose writers have said “they have plenty of material left over.” Krasinski is currently attached to direct the sci-fi thriller Life on Mars&nbsp;next, also for Paramount. In other studio news, Paramount confirmed this week that they are developing two future Star Trek films, which are Quentin Tarantino’s pitch and a proper Star Trek 4, to be directed by C.J. Clarkson, the feature film franchise’s first female director.Fresh Developments1. MARVEL STUDIOS CONSIDERING AN ETERNALS MOVIE AFTER AVENGERS 4(Photo by Marvel Studios)Once upon a time, Marvel Studios was developing an Inhumans movie (which eventually became an ABC TV series with an IMAX debut last year). Marvel Comics has a long history of using races with cosmic connections to fill out their back stories; Inhumans is one, but another is Eternals. That race (like the Inhumans) is an offshoot of humanity, and in the comics at least, Thanos was himself a member of the Eternals (long story). We don’t know how this would work, post Avengers: Infinity War, but Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige said this week that, “Eternals is one of many many many things that we are actively beginning to have creative discussions about to see if we believe in them enough to put them on a slate.” (This statement came after an online rumor that emerged earlier this month.) Marvel developing The Eternals can also be seen as a reaction to Warner Bros’ recent news about Ava DuVernay developing a New Gods movie, as both DC Comics’ New Gods and Marvel’s The Eternals were created by beloved comics artist Jack Kirby. All that being said, Marvel Studios may not make any further official film announcements until after (the still untitled) Avengers 4 is released next year, on May 3rd, 2019.2. ALDEN EHRENREICH ALREADY SIGNED FOR TWO MORE MOVIES AFTER SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)2016’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was produced as a “one time” project, so it was reasonable to expect that each&nbsp;new movie in the Star Wars Story prequels would be standalone films. This week, Hail Caesar! star Alden Ehrenreich, was profiled by Esquire magazine in advance of next month’s Solo: A Star Wars Story (5/25/18), in which he plays the young Han Solo. As part of that profile, Ehrenreich “let slip” that he is already signed for two more Star Wars movies, suggesting a full trilogy of Solo prequels. In other Solo: A Star Wars Story news this week, Lucasfilm made an unusual decision with the film’s “character posters,” which each have their actor’s names credited, except for Joonas Suotamo, whose name is excluded from the Chewbacca poster.3. LOUIS C.K.&nbsp;REPLACED BY&nbsp;PATTON OSWALT&nbsp;IN THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS 2(Photo by Universal Pictures)Although the 2016 animated hit The Secret Life of Pets had a large ensemble voice cast, the lead character was obviously a Jack Russell Terrier named Max. Within two months of the film’s release, Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment began development on The Secret Life of Pets 2, with most of the first film’s voice cast expected to return. That, however, was a full year before the #metoo movement of late 2017 and the revelations about comedian Louis C.K., who voiced Max in the first movie. We can now confirm that Patton Oswalt is taking over the voice role of Max, along with the revelation that Harrison Ford will be making his voice acting debut in the sequel as well. Girls Trip star Tiffany Haddish is also joining the franchise in this sequel, as are Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Universal Pictures has scheduled The Secret Life of Pets 2 for release on June 7, 2019 (up against the Charlie’s Angels reboot).4. MARVEL STARS HUGH JACKMAN AND ZOE SALDANA TO HEADLINE NEXT LAIKA STOP-MOTION(Photo by Wilson Webb/Warner Bros.)The LAIKA stop-motion animation studio released its first film Coraline (Certified Fresh at 90%) in 2009, followed by films in 2012, 2014, and 2016 (ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls, and Kubo and the Two Strings, respectively). Though&nbsp;“LAIKA Film Five” was at one point scheduled for next month, on 5/18/18.&nbsp;Though we still don’t have a title, release date, or premise for&nbsp;“LAIKA Film Five,” which is a&nbsp;“globe-trotting comedy adventure” originally scheduled for release on 5/18 of this year, we now know who the three lead voice actors will be. Those stars are Hugh Jackman (the Easter Bunny in 2012’s Rise of the Guardians), Zoe Saldana (Neytiri in James Cameron’s Avatar franchise), and Zach Galifianakis (the Joker in last year’s The LEGO Batman Movie).&nbsp;The film will be directed by Chris Butler, who co-directed ParaNorman, and co-wrote Kubo and the Two Strings.5.&nbsp;18 YEARS LATER, A CHICKEN RUN SEQUEL IS FINALLY BEING HATCHEDAlthough once revolutionary, the “3D animation” we see in CGI, claymation, or stop motion has been around a pretty long time. One example is 2000’s Chicken Run&nbsp;from Aardman Studios, which still maintains an impressive 97% Tomatometer rating. Aardman’s most recent film was arguably a “box office bomb,” having earned just over $8 million in the two months since its release in February, so it’s perhaps understandable that&nbsp;the studio is returning&nbsp;to its biggest hit, which is&nbsp;also the most successful stop-motion film by any company. Aardman is indeed now developing&nbsp;a Chicken Run sequel, which will be directed by Sam Fell, who co-directed the aforementioned ParaNorman, as well as Flushed Away&nbsp;and The Tale of Despereaux. It’s not yet known if Mel Gibson will reprise his starring role as Rocky the Rooster.6. BRAD PITT CO-PRODUCING MOVIE ABOUT THE HARVEY WEINSTEIN EXPOSE(Photo by Daniel Smith/Paramount Pictures)Last October, as more and more details broke about the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the related #metoo movement, writers frequently pointed out that the story could someday become exactly the sort of “Oscar bait” film that Weinstein himself specialized in. We’re barely six months away from that moment, and yes, indeed, exactly that sort of film project is already in the works. Brad Pitt’s Plan B (12 Years a Slave, Moonlight) production company is teaming up with Megan Ellison’s Annapurna (Phantom Thread, Detroit) for the untitled project. The movie will spin out of the rights to the true story of how New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey did the “real press” work of uncovering the allegations against Weinstein that date back to the 1970s. There are not yet any suggestions about who might play Kantor or Twohey (though some of Weinstein’s victims could certainly be up for the roles), Harvey Weinstein himself, or any of the other victims (such as whether anyone would be willing to play themselves).7. BEVERLY FROM LAST YEAR’S IT IS ALSO NOW OUR NEW NANCY DREW(Photo by Warner Bros.)Back in 2007, Emma Roberts starred in Nancy Drew, which was an attempt to revive the character previously most popular in live action when she was played by Pamela Sue Martin in ABC’s 1970s TV series The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries. That movie didn’t do well enough to inspire a new franchise, but Warner Bros appears ready to try again. The new Nancy Drew star will be Sophia Lillis, who starred in sister company New Line Cinema’s adaptation of Stephen King’s IT as Beverly Marsh. (Jessica Chastain is signed to play the adult Beverly in next year’s IT: Chapter Two.) The first movie in the new franchise will be called Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase, adapted from the 1930 book The Hidden Staircase, the second book in the original series by Mildred Wirt Benson (writing as Carolyn Keene). Sophia Lillis also signed on this week to co-star with Naomi Watts&nbsp;in Burning Season, “a mother-daughter relationship drama against the landscape of Madagascar, an island prone to forest fires where nearly all the species are indigenous – and many are endangered.”8.&nbsp;ANOTHER “TRUE” CLOVERFIELD SEQUEL IN THE WORKS, POST-CLOVERFIELD PARADOX(Photo by Scott Garfield/Netflix)This year, the company that arguably landed the biggest and most surprising marketing coup during the Super Bowl was Netflix, who unveiled that their recently required God Particle project was now called The Cloverfield Paradox&nbsp;and set to start streaming when the big game ended.&nbsp; The Cloverfield Paradox appeared to be a hit for Netflix, which seemed to put new pressure on this October’s World War II zombie movie Overlord, which in the past was suggested&nbsp;to be the next Cloverfield movie. This week at CinemaCon, producer J.J. Abrams clarified that Overlord will not be the fourth Cloverfield movie, but another movie is still in development. Without getting into specifics, J.J. Abrams stated that, “we’re actually developing a true, dedicated Cloverfield sequel.” And unlike The Cloverfield Paradox, this fourth Cloverfield film will indeed receive a full theatrical release, and will not debut on a streaming service like Netflix.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1. VOICE CAST ANNOUNCED FOR&nbsp;ANGRY BIRDS&nbsp;SEQUEL(Photo by Columbia Pictures)Hollywood keeps making movies based on video games (like the recent Rampage, Rotten at 51%), and they keep earning&nbsp;low Tomatometer scores, even with 47 attempts&nbsp; to date. They also continue to earn Rotten scores regardless of their origin, including “app” game movies like 2016’s The Angry Birds Movie (Rotten at 43%). That movie did “okay” at the domestic box office ($107 million), but it was a bigger hit overseas with $352 million worldwide. And so, Sony Pictures has scheduled The Angry Birds Movie 2 for release next year on September 20, 2019, and this week, we learned about some of the new voice cast members. The list includes Sterling K. Brown (TV’s This is Us), Awkwafina (Ocean’s Eight), Zach Woods (TV’s Silicon Valley), and Saturday Night Live star Leslie Jones. Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Bill Hader, Danny McBride, and Peter Dinklage are also all returning to voice their characters for the sequel.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"fresh, films, Awards, the, versus, Infographic, Disney, richard","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/27180555/A-Quiet-Place-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"a-quiet-place-sequel-in-the-works-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509182694724","title":"Logan Writer/Director James Mangold Tapped for Boba Fett Spinoff, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Logan Writer/Director James Mangold Tapped for Boba Fett Spinoff, and More Movie NewsSpider-Man, IT Chapter Two, and Jown Wick 3 cast up, and new roles for Charlize Theron, Gal Gadot, Ryan Reynolds, and Channing Tatum, among others.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 25, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, the Men in Black spinoff, and new roles for Gal Gadot, Bradley Cooper, and Charlize Theron.This WEEK’S TOP STORYLOGAN DIRECTOR SLICES INTO BOBA FETT PREQUEL(Photo by Lucasfilm)Up until three years ago, one of the Star Wars Story solo projects closest to happening (after Rogue One and this week’s Solo) was a prequel focusing on the pre-Empire Strikes Back adventures of the bounty hunter called Boba Fett. The plan at that point was for Boba Fett: A Star Wars Story to be helmed by a young director named Josh Trank, who had made his debut with the 2012 “found footage” superhero movie Chronicle. So, what changed in 2015? Trank’s second movie, the reboot of Fantastic Four&nbsp;(9% on the Tomatometer) happened. Reportedly, this led to the director’s departure from Boba Fett (and just before they were set to make a big announcement at that year’s Star Wars Celebration event). In the three years since, Boba Fett has been a “what-might-have-been” fantasy, but now, it’s back on.&nbsp; To revive the&nbsp;project, Lucasfilm has recruited director James Mangold, who is coming off a hot two-film run with Fox on Hugh Jackman’s two most recent X-Men spinoffs, Wolverine (69%) and Logan (Certified Fresh at 93%). It has not yet been confirmed whether Mangold’s Boba Fett will remain a prequel, but that’s the general presumption online, since Rogue One and Solo both were. It should be noted that the film&nbsp;is presumably a few years away from happening, as the director’s next project is still expected to be Ford v. Ferrari, about the automotive rivalry behind the scenes at the Le Mans race in 1966.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;JAKE GYLLENHAAL TO PLAY NEXT SPIDER-MAN VILLAIN, MYSTERIO(Photo by Anne Marie Fox/Fox Searchlight)You might recall that in late March, there was a report that Matt Damon had turned down a major villain role in next year’s sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming. When The Weekly Ketchup reported on the decision, this writer predicted that the secret villain in question would be Mysterio, one of Spider-Man’s best long-time super villains who hasn’t yet been depicted in a live-action movie. Well, we can now confirm that Jake Gyllenhaal is in talks to co-star in Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, and the villain role is indeed Mysterio, the former movie industry F/X expert who uses his techniques for crime. Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios have scheduled the not-yet-titled sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming for July 5th, 2019, which puts it up against the sequel to&nbsp;Annabelle: Creation.2. THE WORLD OF JOHN WICK EXPLODES WITH NEW CAST MEMBERS(Photo by RCF/Everett Collection)Ever since the relatively-recent successes of franchises like The Avengers and The Conjuring, one of the top prizes in Hollywood has been the concept of building a “cinematic universe,” and with that, one of the key narrative features is “world building.” Although we’re only two films in, John Wick and its sequel John Wick: Chapter 2 arguably succeeded because so much care was put into building a world that Keanu Reeves’ character inhabits. For the third film, currently called just John Wick 3 (5/17/2019), Reeves will be joined by an even larger cast of stars that seems likely to&nbsp;continue building that aforementioned world. The new female lead will be played by Halle Berry (coming off another action sequel, last year’s Kingsman: The Golden Circle), and Anjelica Huston will play the mysterious assassin leader called The Director. Other ominous roles will include&nbsp;Zero (Mark Dacascos), The Tick Tock Man (Jason Mantzoukas), and The Adjuciator of the High Table (Asia Kate Dillon). Keanu Reeves’ competition on May 17th, 2019 currently includes the sequel A Dog’s Journey, the YA adaptation The Sun is Also a Star, and the Elton John musical Rocketman (starring Taron Egerton, star of the Kingsman franchise).3.&nbsp;CHARLIZE THERON TO PORTRAY MEGYN KELLY&nbsp;IN ROGER AILES MOVIE(Photo by Andres Otero/Everett Collection)A running joke on Howard Stern’s popular radio show last year was that he was producing a stage musical about Roger Ailes of FOX News (or is it a joke?). That, however, was also before the #metoo movement and the allegations against Harvey Weinstein and others. Brad Pitt is now co-producing a movie about the Weinstein story,&nbsp;and a movie about Ailes and FOX News is also being fast tracked (by Annapurna, Pitt’s aforementioned coproduction partner). We don’t yet know who will be playing Roger Ailes, but the currently-untitled project’s first casting announcement involves a major A-list star. Charlize Theron is now attached to co-star as former Fox News anchor (and current The Today Show star) Megyn Kelly. The project about the sexual allegations behind the scenes at FOX News will be directed by Jay Roach (Game Change, The Campaign, Trumbo) from a screenplay by Charles Randolph (cowriter of The Big Short), both of whom have tackled politically charged films with great success.4.&nbsp;GAL GADOT MAY STAR IN CUBAN ROMANCE MY DEAREST FIDEL(Photo by RCF/Everett Collection)There was a great deal of coverage of the pay disparity last year between Wonder Woman and Justice League star Gal Gadot and that of some of her male co-stars. One positive outcome of Gadot’s deal with Warner Bros is that she now has a production deal with the studio, and this week, we learned of one of her first projects. Gal Gadot and former Warner Bros executive Sue Kroll are now producing an adaptation of a Politico article published last month. That article was called&nbsp;“My Dearest Fidel: An ABC Journalist’s Secret Liaison With Fidel Castro,” and its subtitle, “The untold story of how Lisa Howard’s intimate diplomacy with Cuba’s revolutionary leader changed the course of the Cold War,” tells you even more (except that much of the story is set in 1964, boom). In addition to producing, Gal Gadot may also star in this politically charged romance as Lisa Howard, the reporter who reportedly befriended Cuban leader Fidel Castro.5. IT CHAPTER TWO CASTS KIWI/AUSSIE ACTOR AS BEN HANSCOM(Photo by Ben Mark Holzberg/The CW )Following the runaway box office succcess ($700 million worldwide)&nbsp;of last year’s IT, New Line Cinema is now preparing to adapt the rest of Stephen King’s novel, in which the Losers Club reunites 30 years later to finally defeat Pennywise. Jessica Chastain was the first to be cast as the adult Beverly, followed by James McAvoy and Bill Hader, who will play Bill and Richie, respectively. Two more actors were cast as adult Losers Club members last week, but neither was quite as famous as any of the first three. That deeper bench of adult Losers Club members expanded again this week, with the casting of New Zealand/Australian actor Jay Ryan as the adult version of Ben Hanscom.&nbsp;Jay Ryan has worked the most on TV shows like Top of the Lake, Beauty and the Beast, and Mary Kills People. Ben Hanscom, in the first movie, was the “new kid” who did much of the research into the past of the scary clown monster Pennywise. New Line Cinema has scheduled IT: Chapter Two for release on September 6th, 2019,&nbsp;the week before Slumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle‘s next film before moving on to James Bond 25, scheduled for November 8th, 2019, the first under a new distribution deal announced last year.6.&nbsp;CHANNING TATUM AND LEBRON JAMES PARTNERING FOR PUBLIC ENEMY(Photo by Claudette Barius/Warner Bros., Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures)Following the box office success in 2015 of the N.W.A. musical biopic Straight Outta Compton, there was much speculation about which other classic rap groups could next receive their own movies. One candidate seemed to be Public Enemy, but Chuck D was quick to note that such a movie is probably unlikely to happen anytime soon. We note this because if such a movie does get produced, it will probably need a different title (though the N.W.A. movie wasn’t called N.W.A. either). That’s because basketball star LeBron James and Channing Tatum are partnering on an action comedy pitch for New Line Cinema called exactly that, Public Enemy. Without giving away details, Public Enemy is described as “a subversive action-comedy that looks at the speed of media in our current landscape.” Presumably, LeBron James and Channing Tatum are producing Public Enemy with their eyes on co-starring together.7.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN NETFLIX: RYAN REYNOLDS, IDRIS ELBA, JENNIFER ANISTON, AND BARACK OBAMA(Photo by Hilary Bronwyn Gale/Focus Features)The Weekly Ketchup&nbsp;typically only features ten stories each week (granted, this week is an exception), and in some cases, the ever-growing streaming behemoth that is Netflix has the&nbsp;potential to dominate the whole column. That scope is only getting bigger, too, with the news that Deadpool 2 star Ryan Reynolds is teaming with Michael Bay&nbsp;for Six Underground, Netflix’s most expensive action movie yet, about a group of billionaires who fake their own deaths so that they can fight crime, sort of like real world superheroes. Idris Elba is also going to direct, star in, and do the music for a new adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame for Netflix. In addition, while don’t know any specific titles yet, former POTUS Barack Obama and Mrs. Michelle Obama have also signed a multi-year contract with Netflix to potentially produce series, mini-series, documentaries, or feature films. Finally, speaking of the Oval Office, Jennifer Aniston and comedian Tig Notaro will star in the Netflix comedy First Ladies&nbsp;as the first lesbian couple to inhabit the White House (with Aniston as the POTUS and Notaro as the First Lady). We can expect most of these projects to start streaming sometime in 2019, or at the latest, 2020.8. LIAM NEESON TO HOST INTERGALACTIC KEGGER (OR NOT) IN MEN IN BLACK SPINOFF(Photo by Maria Marin/Sony Pictures Classics)Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were the stars of the Men in Black trilogy, but some of the best zingers came from Zed, their boss, as played by Rip Torn. We’ve known for a while now about Sony Pictures’ plan for a “spinoff” that would feature Thor: Ragnarok stars Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson. We still don’t know the premise that makes it a spinoff, but we got another hint this week. Taken star Liam Neeson is now in talks with Sony to co-star as the leader of the “U.K. branch of the titular agency, a counterpart to Rip Torn’s role as Zed.” With that information, we can now guess that the fourth Men in Black film is switching continents to Europe and/or England. Sony Pictures has scheduled the film&nbsp;for June 14th, 2019, which puts it up against the sequel Son in Shaft, a week after The Secret Life of Pets 2, and a week before Pixar’s Toy Story 4.9. PARAMOUNT PULLS THE PLUG ON 2019 RELEASE FOR TRANSFORMERS 7(Photo by Paramount Pictures)There has been a lot of news in the last year or so about Paramount Pictures’ future plans for the&nbsp;Transformers franchise, including Michael Bay’s comment last year&nbsp;that there are a total of 14&nbsp;movies already written, waiting to be produced. The first one to come out of the “Transformers writers room” is this year’s Bumblebee (12/21/18), which appears to be both a prequel (set in the 1980s), and a character-centric spinoff. Until this week, however, all we really knew about Transformers 7 was that Paramount had given the film a release date next summer of June 28th, 2019. Well… not so fast. We can now confirm that Paramount has yanked Transformers 7 not just from that date, but from their schedule altogether. The emphasis now appears to be on other Hasbro adaptations (like G.I. Joe: Snake Eyes, Micronauts, M.A.S.K., and Rom: Spaceknight). That might mean that we will indeed get a Transformers reboot at a later point (that, for example, could feature character designs closer to the classic 1980s cartoons), but after Bumblebee, this current six-film cycle may be completed. We’re calling this a borderline “Fresh Development,” because it means a halt — or a t least a pause — for a franchise with consistently low Tomatometer scores.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1.&nbsp;88-YEAR-OLD CLINT EASTWOOD RETURNING TO ACTING AS THE MULE(Photo by Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros.)It has now been six years since Clint Eastwood last starred in a movie (2012’s Trouble with the Curve), and ten years since he both directed and starred in a movie (2008’s Gran Torino). At the age of 88, Eastwood is now preparing to do both again in his next directorial project,&nbsp;titled The Mule. Eastwood’s American Sniper star Bradley Cooper is also in talks to co-star with him in The Mule, which will be an adaptation of this 2014 article from New York Times Magazine about a 90-year-old drug mule for the Sinaloa Cartel, and Eastwood will play a fictionalized composite character. If he signs on, Cooper will play a “hard-charging DEA agent tracking Eastwood’s character, “a man in his 80s who is broke, alone, and facing foreclosure of his business when he is offered a job that simply requires him to drive” (carrying major drugs). In other Bradley Cooper news, it appears that his Leonard Bernstein biopic, called simply Bernstein, may now have the edge over the project Jake Gyllenhaal is attached to star in, because Cooper’s project now has exclusive film rights to Bernstein’s compositions. We’re calling The Mule this week’s Rotten Idea because of his spotty record with&nbsp;fact-based films.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Biopics, Christmas, die, Comic, drama, One, Red, league, cartoon, Plus, Fox, stop, Dark","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/25160217/Boba-Fett-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"logan-writerdirector-james-mangold-tapped-for-boba-fett-spinoff-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509182691650","title":"Al Pacino and Dakota Fanning Join Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Al Pacino and Dakota Fanning Join Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and More Movie NewsVal Kilmer returns to Top Gun, Reese Witherspoon is Legally Blonde again, The Addams Family unleashes stellar cast, and Jared Leto's Joker goes solo.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 8, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as The Addams Family, Legally Blonde 3, Top Gun: Maverick, and the Willy Wonka reboot.This WEEK’S TOP STORYAL PACINO AND DAKOTA FANNING JOIN TARANTINO’S ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD(Photo by Hopper Stone/Bleecker Street, Derek Storm/Everett Collection)For his ninth film, next year’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (8/9/19), Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained) appears to going “all in” on paying homage to the film industry&nbsp;that shaped his youth as a fan. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is set in Los Angeles in 1969 with the Manson Family (and their victims) as supporting characters, and the two leads are a TV actor (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double friend (played by Brad Pitt). The movie got a few more stars this week, with the biggest being Al Pacino, who will be working with Tarantino for the first time, as DiCaprio’s character’s agent. Other actors joining the ensemble cast this week&nbsp;as real historical characters include Dakota Fanning (as Manson follower Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme), Damian Lewis (from TV’s Homeland, as famous actor Steve McQueen), and Emile Hirsch as massacre victim Jay Sebring. They’ll also be joined by Luke Perry, Clifton Collins, Jr, Keith Jefferson, and Nicholas Hammond, along with previously announced actors like Margot Robbie (as Sharon Tate), Michael Madsen, Timothy Olyphant, Burt Reynolds, and Tim Roth. Check out this photo gallery at The Wrap to see side-by-side comparisons between the cast of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and their real-life counterparts.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;CHARLIZE THERON, ALLISON JANNEY LEAD ALL-STAR&nbsp;ADDAMS FAMILY&nbsp;VOICE CAST(Photo by Andres Otero/Everett Collection)We first heard in December that Star Wars: The Last Jedi star Oscar Isaac was likely to voice Gomez Addams in next year’s animated reboot of The Addams Family. At that point, however, we lacked the names of the other cast members. This week, MGM unveiled that voice cast, and there are definitely a few fan favorites involved. The animated hand that Oscar Isaac’s Gomez will be kissing will be Charlize Theron’s, who is now signed to voice Morticia Addams. Their kids Wednesday and Pugsley will be voiced by Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) and Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things). Nick Kroll will voice Uncle Fester, Bette Midler will voice Grandmama, and the family’s archnemesis Margaux Needler will be voiced by Allison Janney. MGM has scheduled The Addams Family for October 11, 2019, up against the novel adaptation The Goldfinch, and Nickelodeon’s Are You Afraid of the Dark? You can see the first concept art for The Addams Family by following this link to Collider.2.&nbsp;REESE WITHERSPOON DUSTING OFF HER HEELS FOR&nbsp;LEGALLY BLONDE 3Reese Witherspoon’s 2001 law school comedy Legally Blonde was a surprise hit, earning $141 million globally from a budget of just $18 million. That movie also had a Fresh Tomatometer score of 68%. Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde, which came out 15 years ago and earned just a 37% on the Tomatometer, seemed to be the end of Elle Woods’ big screen adventures. Since then, however, the film has&nbsp;also become a hit broadway musical, which ostensibly buoyed the cultural significance of Reese Witherspoon’s movies. That may be part of the justification for this week’s news that MGM is in negotiations with Witherspoon&nbsp;for her to star in Legally Blonde 3. (You can read some of&nbsp;her thoughts on Legally Blonde 3 here as well.) MGM appears to be fast-tracking Legally Blonde 3, as the studio has already set a release date of Valentine’s Day, 2020, up against two mystery projects from Disney and WB/DC. In somewhat related news, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical In the Heights is now scheduled for release on June 26, 2020.3. ANDRA DAY MIGHT BE THE LADY WHO SINGS THE BLUES IN NEW BIOPIC(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)The short life of 1930s-1950s jazz singer Billie Holiday (1915-1959) has inspired many books, homages, and a film biopic (1972’s Lady Sings the Blues),&nbsp;as well as the stage musical Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill. Billie Holiday had a distinctive vocal style which added to her legacy, even as it was cut short by drug and alcohol abuse (her death at the age of 44 was related to cirrhosis of the liver). Although Lady Sings the Blues received 5 nominations, it didn’t score any wins (losing mostly to either The Godfather or Cabaret). Director Lee Daniels (Precious, Lee Daniels’ The Butler) is now in talks to develop a new Billie Holiday biopic called Billie, based on a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Suzan Lori-Parks. If the project gets going soon, singer/songwriter Andra Day (“Rise Up”) is being eyed to star as Billie. In related news, the long-in-development Bob Marley biopic is now being developed by his son Ziggy Marley and is set up at Paramount Pictures.4.&nbsp;VAL KILMER TO RETURN AS ICEMAN FOR&nbsp;TOP GUN: MAVERICKWe reported above that Reese Witherspoon is looking to return to Legally Blonde after 15 years, and another movie that’s getting a sequel after an even longer hiatus (by twice as many years) is Top Gun. Tom Cruise just took to Twitter last week to announce that filming had started on Top Gun: Maverick. We can also now report that Val Kilmer will be returning as his “Iceman” character in the sequel. It’s unclear, however, what Val Kilmer’s participation will involve, as the actor is known to still be recovering from a bout with throat cancer. (In other words, don’t necessarily expect to see Kilmer joining Cruise in any of his signature dangerous stunt scenes.) Paramount Pictures has scheduled Top Gun: Maverick for release next year on July 12, 2019, the week before Disney’s remake of The Lion King.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK5. WHO’S GOING TO THE LAND OF PURE IMAGINATION IN THE WILLY WONKA PREQUEL?In October of 2016, we reported that Warner Bros had acquired the rights to all of Roald Dahl’s Willy Wonka&nbsp;intellectual properties, with an eye toward rebooting the franchise with a movie about the younger Wonka’s adventures. A year and a half later, the project has apparently made its way far enough through development that Warner Bros. now has a shortlist of potential stars for the project. The three actors whose names were leaked this week are all quite different, and maybe that’s the point. Let’s start with Ryan Gosling, who is coming off last year’s Blade Runner 2049, and next has the NASA true story First Man (expect the trailer this week) on 10/12/18.&nbsp;Next up is&nbsp;Ezra Miller, the youngest of the three, who played the Flash in last year’s Justice League. Finally, there’s Donald Glover of Community,&nbsp;Atlanta,&nbsp;and Childish Gambino fame, who is currently in theaters in another prequel, Solo: A Star Wars Story, playing the young Lando Calrissian. Which actor do you think should be the young Willy Wonka, or perhaps a better question is, should there even be a Willy Wonka prequel at all? Director Paul King scored a rare 100% on the Tomatometer earlier this year with Paddington 2, which is now officially the film with the most reviews to achieve a 100% score, but we’re still calling this idea of a Willy Wonka reboot something of a potential stinker.4.&nbsp;ARE YOU READY FOR A KICK-ASS CINEMATIC UNIVERSE? A KICK-ASS-IVERSE?(Photo by Daniel Smith/Universal Pictures)For those keeping track at home, we now have at least five “cinematic universes” based on comic books in various stages of development or production. Those include two based on Marvel Comics (with Fox’s X-Men franchise still outside Marvel Studios), Warner Bros’ DC Comics films, the plans for Valiant Comics adaptations, and Paramount’s Hasbro properties, which might be based on comic book stories as well. This week, we learned that director Matthew Vaughn has set up a production company called Marv Studios under his Marv Films label, with which he plans on producing his own line of comic book adaptations. A central project to that goal is a reboot of Kick-Ass, possibly focusing on the character of Patience Lee, an “African-American single mother who assumes the vigilante mantle in Mark Millar’s comics.” Matthew Vaughn also hopes to reboot Hit Girl (possibly without Chloe Grace Moretz), and to also continue making more Kingsman movies starring Taron Egerton. Kick-Ass 2 received a Rotten score of just 33%; can a Kick-Ass reboot do better with critics?3.&nbsp;EDDIE MURPHY SAYS&nbsp;DOLEMITE IS MY NAME&nbsp;TO NETFLIX(Photo by Bruce McBroom/DreamWorks)The 1975 blaxploitation film Dolemite has not aged well, but in its time,&nbsp;it&nbsp;was a relative box office smash, earning $12 million (in 1975 dollars) from a budget of just $100,000. The success of Dolemite (and its sequels) was likely due in great part to the popularity of its star, comedian and singer Rudy Ray Moore, who adopted the Dolemite pimp character off screen as well. Netflix has consistently become a refuge and career restarter for a wide variety of stars, and one such actor looking for a bump from the streaming giant is Eddie Murphy, who’s only had one lead role in the last six years (2016’s Mr. Church). Murphy is aligning with Netflix on their Rudy Ray Moore biopic called Dolemite is My Name. The 1970s-set comedy biopic will be directed by Craig Brewer, whose first film Hustle &amp; Flow was itself influenced by the 1970s and early rap. Here is the R-rated trailer for Rudy Ray Moore’s original Dolemite, so you can get an idea of what Eddie Murphy’s taking on (Shrek, this is not).2.&nbsp;BRIAN DEPALMA&nbsp;WORKING ON HARVEY-WEINSTEIN-INSPIRED HORROR FILM PREDATOR(Photo by Jason Mendez/Everett Collection)As the allegations against Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men in Hollywood emerged last year as part of the #metoo movement, writers speculated that we’d eventually some of those stories adapted into movies. And it’s all happening pretty quickly, too, starting with the news in April that Brad Pitt was co-producing a movie about the two female New York Times reporters who ran one of the earliest stories about the Weinstein allegations. Some of these movies, however, will be fictional, and one such project is being developed by director Brian DePalma (Scarface, Carrie, The Untouchables). DePalma describes his project, called Predator (not to be confused with the alien/sci-fi franchise),&nbsp;as a horror film&nbsp;about a sexual predator in the film industry (who isn’t named Harvey Weinstein, but…). In somewhat related news, director/producer Brett Ratner, who was himself the focus of several allegations last year, is reportedly still telling people that he’s directing Rush Hour 4, but sources at Warner Bros describe such a project as being a “suicide mission.”1. JARED LETO’S JOKER GETS HIS OWN SOLO MOVIE(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)It’s getting trickier and trickier to keep up with all of the various projects Warner Bros. and DC Comics have in development, frequently with the same characters. Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad, for example, has been attached to Suicide Squad 2, Gotham City Sirens, Birds of Prey, a possible solo Harley Quinn movie, and maybe a Joker/Harley movie on top of that. Of course, we can all guess that many of these projects won’t get made (right now, Birds of Prey may happen first). Something similar has been going on with&nbsp;the Joker, with news in the last several months about different projects, including an origin story from director Todd Phillips (The Hangover) (with Joaquin Phoenix rumored to be considered for the role). But what about the actor who’s most recently played&nbsp;the Joker, Jared Leto? It was confirmed this week that, yes, a solo movie for Jared Leto’s tattooed take on the Joker is indeed still in development, as well as a Joker origin story movie. We’re calling Jared Leto’s The Joker a “Rotten Idea” based on the 27% Tomatometer score&nbsp;Suicide Squad recevied in 2016, which is doubled with the late-breaking news that Warner Bros is still developing the screenplay for a team sequel for Suicide Squad 2.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"of, 2018, TV, ID, latino, Columbia, marvel, awards, nightmare, Tumblr, TV, Book","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/08161434/Pacino-Fanning-Tarantino-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"al-pacino-and-dakota-fanning-join-tarantinos-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509184474442","title":"James McAvoy and Bill Hader in Talks for IT: Chapter Two, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})James McAvoy and Bill Hader in Talks for IT: Chapter Two, and More Movie NewsFast and Furious spinoff secures its director, live-action Mulan adds a trio of icons, Batgirl gets a writer, and new roles for Peter Dinklage, Kristen Bell, and Melissa McCarthy.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 13, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Batgirl, Coming 2 America, Mulan and the Fast &amp; Furious spinoff Hobbs &amp; Shaw.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJAMES MCAVOY AND BILL HADER MAY FACE PENNYWISE IN IT: CHAPTER TWO(Photo by Joe Scarnici/Getty Images, Linda Wheeler/Everett Collection)In February, it was confirmed that Mama star Jessica Chastain was signed to reunite with that film’s director for IT: Chapter Two, playing the adult version of Beverly. Chastain’s past work with director Andy Muschietti probably made her the easiest actor to announce first, but it also meant that “adult Beverly” actually got announced before any of the male members of “The Losers Club“.&nbsp; We can now report, however, that the first male actors who may be cast in two of those roles could&nbsp;be James McAvoy (Split, X-Men: First Class) and Saturday Night Live alumnus Bill Hader. James McAvoy would play the group’s leader Bill (who, as played by Jaeden Liberher, had a stutter as a child), and Bill Hader would&nbsp;be the joker of the group, Richie Tozier, who was played by Stranger Things star Finn Wolfhard. We also know now that New Line Cinema has scheduled filming of IT: Chapter Two for this summer at locations in Toronto, which makes sense since the second half of the adaptation of Stephen King’s novel has already been scheduled for release next year on September 6, 2019.Fresh Developments1. WITH SUCCESS OF&nbsp;A QUIET PLACE, NEXT UP FOR JOHN KRASINSKI IS LIFE ON MARS(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer/Paramount Pictures)After several weeks of box office pundits bemoaning the relatively disappointing numbers for films like A Wrinkle in Time, Tomb Raider, and Pacific Rim: Uprising, things improved with Ready Player One and last weekend’s $50 million opening for A Quiet Place. (Of course, it may not be a coincidence that those first three were Rotten, and the latter two were Fresh.)&nbsp;That surprisingly strong opening for A Quiet Place led to a quick new deal for director and star John Krasinksi, who is now in talks to direct a film called Life on Mars. The science fiction drama is based on a short story by Cecil Castellucci called We Have Always Live on Mars, about future Martian colonists from Earth who find themselves abandoned on the 4th planet after a disaster. Krasinksi is not expected to star in Life on Mars, but it has a female lead, so Emily Blunt might still be a possibility.2. DEADPOOL 2 DIRECTOR DOWN FOR FAST &amp; FURIOUS SPINOFF HOBBS &amp; SHAW(Photo by Jonathan Prime/Focus Features)Back in February, we first heard who the frontrunner was to direct the Fast &amp; Furious spinoff focusing on the characters played in previous films by Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. That director was David Leitch, who made his solo debut with Atomic Blonde, and also directed next month’s Deadpool 2. Well, this week we learned that David Leitch will indeed direct the spinoff, which reportedly has the working title of Hobbs and Shaw (the names of Johnson and Statham’s characters). Hobbs and Shaw&nbsp;is scheduled for release on July 26, 2019, which is several months before the ninth and final official Fast &amp; Furious movie, which is scheduled for April 10th, 2020. It’s not yet known if Johnson will appear in that final Fast and Furious movie with his pal Vin Diesel (but don’t count on it).3. DISNEY CASTS DONNIE YEN, JET LI, AND GONG LI IN LIVE-ACTION MULAN(Photo by Jonathan Olley/Walt Disney Studios)Walt Disney Pictures announced back in November that Chinese actress Liu Yifei (AKA Crystal Liu) had been cast as the&nbsp;titular heroine&nbsp;in their live-action remake of Mulan. It wasn’t until this week, however that we first heard who will be supporting Liu in the remake. The first news came yesterday as Donnie Yen&nbsp;was signed to play Commander Tung, Mulan’s mentor and teacher. Mulan will be Yen’s second film for Disney after starring as Chirrut Îmwe in 2016’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. We also learned this week that Gong Li will play the film’s villain, a powerful witch (a premise change from the 1998 animated movie), and that Jet Li will play the Emperor of China. Walt Disney Pictures has scheduled Mulan for March 27th, 2020, where it is currently up against the reboot of G.I. Joe.4. PETER DINKLAGE TO STAR AS A LEPRECHAUN (SORT OF) IN O LUCKY DAY(Photo by Macall B. Polay/HBO)Peter Dinklage has obviously appeared in some roles that were related to his height (Elf, Game of Thrones, and HBO’s upcoming My Dinner with Hervé). There are, however, just as many (or arguably more) examples of roles where Dinklage’s height status is incidental (such as Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri). Dinklage has been attached to a crime comedy called O Lucky Day since 2014, but it appears that the film is finally&nbsp;nearing production. Director Jon S. Baird (2014’s Filth) has signed with Legendary Entertainment to direct O Lucky Day, in which Peter Dinklage will play a career conman who poses as a leprechaun in “an elaborate scheme of vengeance,” working from a screenplay by Andrew Dodge (Bad Words; co-writer of Space Jam 2). Dinklage is currently deep into filming of the eighth and&nbsp; final season of Game of Thrones, which recently wrapped a battle sequence that took 55 days to film.5.&nbsp;COMING TO AMERICA SEQUEL AND SCARFACE REBOOT CONFIRMED FOR 2018 FILMING(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)It’s perhaps not particularly sexy, but if you are a fan of film development news, one of the most telling things to follow each year is California’s film production tax credits. These reports are significant because they tell us specific projects that are close enough to filming that they’ve filed with the state. Of the nine projects awarded in the latest round, five in particular stand out. First up, there is Eddie Murphy’s&nbsp;Coming 2 America, the sequel to the 1988 comedy hit&nbsp;that&nbsp;the Ketchup first reported on in September. Other projects included in the report are Universal’s Scarface reboot, the car business historical drama Ford V. Ferrari, Jordan Peele’s next film as director after Get Out, and the long-awaited Deadwood movie.6. HOMELAND STAR DAMIAN LEWIS TO STAR IN BIOPIC ABOUT TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD(Photo by Jojo Whilden/Showtime)In 2016, former Toronto mayor Rob Ford died after a two year struggle with cancer,&nbsp;bringing&nbsp;to a sad close Ford’s very public legacy, which included a series of scandals involving alcohol and drugs. Ford is the key figure in a drama now being filmed in Toronto called Run This Town, about a reporter (Ben Platt) attempting to expose a scandal involving “a politician who doesn’t play by the rules.” This week, it was confirmed that the politician in question is indeed the late Rob Ford, who will be portrayed by British actor Damian Lewis. Lewis is best known to audiences in the United States for his work on the HBO mini-series Band of Brothers&nbsp;and the first three seasons of Showtime’s Homeland series (opposite Claire Danes). Lewis is being fitted with a “body prosthetic” in order to better match Ford’s profile and appearance.7.&nbsp;FROZEN&nbsp;STAR KRISTEN BELL TO LET IT GO AT FANTASY CAMP(Photo by Universal Pictures)We’ve known since early 2015 that Walt Disney Animation was developing and producing a sequel to their 2013 hit film Frozen, which is now scheduled for release on November 27, 2019. It’s not known if Kristen Bell has started recording her role as Anna in Frozen 2 yet, but we now know another film that&nbsp;she might be able to film in time for a release in 2019. Bell is now signed for the lead role in the musical Fantasy Camp for STXfilm as “a junior high school teacher that faces her fears and pursues her dreams while attending a Broadway performing-arts camp for adults.” Fantasy Camp is part of a series of female-led projects from STX Entertainment&nbsp;that also includes next week’s I Feel Pretty (starring Amy Schumer), the rom-com Second Act (starring Jennifer Lopez), and the puppet musical The Happytime Murders (starring Elizabeth Banks and Melissa McCarthy).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. MELISSA MCCARTHY TO SHOW OFF HER SUPER-INTELLIGENCE(Photo by Hopper Stone/Columbia Pictures)&nbsp;As Melissa McCarthy has developed her film career post-Mike &amp; Molly, a key collaborator has been her husband Ben Falcone. The thing is, however, that both of the two films Falcone has directed McCarthy in recently have earned Rotten Tomatometer scores: Tammy (24%) and The Boss (22%). (The verdict is still out for the third, Life of the Party, which comes out next month). The possible fourth film was announced this week, and it’s a project for New Line Cinema called Super-Intelligence. Melissa McCarthy will play “a former corporate executive whose earnest yet unfulfilled life is turned upside down when she is selected for observation by the world’s first super-intelligence — an artificial intelligence that may or may not take over the world.” Super-Intelligence was written by screenwriter Steve Mallory, who also wrote The Boss.1. TRANSFORMERS SPINOFF BUMBLEBEE WRITER JOINS&nbsp;BATGIRL(Photo by Paramount Pictures)In February, Avengers and Buffy the Vampire Slayer writer and director Joss Whedon backed out of Warner Bros and DC Comics’ Batgirl, citing the lack of “a story.” Soon after, acclaimed writer Roxane Gay took to Twitter, saying, “Hey @DCComics I can write your batgirl movie, no prob.” This week, we found out&nbsp;who Warner Bros has signed to replace Joss Whedon, and it’s not Roxane Gay, and her Tomatometer is not Fresh. Christina Hodson currently has two credits on RT (Shut In –&nbsp;8% Rotten, and Unforgettable –&nbsp;25% Rotten), and also wrote this December’s Transformers spinoff Bumblebee. None of the five live action Transformers movies has earned a Fresh Tomatometer score, with the first film coming the closest at 57%, and the most recent being the lowest&nbsp;at 16%.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"King, First, free, kong, Columbia, zero, Searchlight, actors, dogs, directors, ratings, Disney+, USA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/13131800/McAvoy-Hader-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"james-mcavoy-and-bill-hader-in-talks-for-it-chapter-two-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509182697798","title":"Jordan Peele May Cast Black Panther Stars in His Next Film, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jordan Peele May Cast Black Panther Stars in His Next Film, and More Movie NewsMore stars join Tarantino's latest, Annette Bening joins Captain Marvel, Friday Night Lights gets another adaptation, and Bill and Ted are due for another excellent adventure.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 11, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Bad Boys for Life, Captain Marvel, and the Friday Night Lights and Pet Sematary remakes.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJORDAN PEELE MAY CAST BLACK PANTHER&nbsp;STARS IN HIS GET OUT FOLLOW-UP US(Photo by Marvel Studios)Traditionally, the measuring sticks applied to movies have been box office (obviously), reviews (super obviously), and each year, awards ceremonies (this being the super-duper obvious one). Over the last decade, however, social media has come to play a larger role as well. Last year, comedian Jordan Peele’s feature film directorial debut Get Out&nbsp;benefited from fervent word of mouth, and just about a year later, so did Marvel’s Black Panther. Jordan Peele revealed the first poster for his next film this week, simply titled Us, which is scheduled for release on March 15th, 2019 (in between Captain Marvel on 3/8/19 and Godzilla: King of the Monsters on 3/22/19). Variety is also reporting that Black Panther co-stars Lupita Nyong’o (Nakia) and Winston Duke (M’Baku) are both in talks or wanted for lead roles. Elizabeth Moss, the star of another social media darling, Hulu’s&nbsp;The Handmaid’s Tale, is also being sought for another lead role. As with Get Out, Jordan Peele is currently being (probably justifiably) vague about the premise of Us, but he has said, “…it’s not gonna be about race, it’ll be about something else, but it’s gonna be very cinematic and fun.”Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;WILL PETER JACKSON DIRECT MORE TOLKIEN… OR DC COMICS?(Photo by Warner Bros.)Probably about 90% of the stories we report on each week come from the same handful of major entertainment sources, but every once in a while we need to broaden our net. For example, when it comes to news about New Zealand director Peter Jackson, a consistently reliable source has been TheOneRing.net, the long-running source for news about Jackson’s Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movies. So, this week, TheOneRing.net Tweeted the following, “Decisions are being made by Peter Jackson and his NZ crew: Return to Middle-earth with Amazon, or play in the DC Universe?” That first option refers to Amazon’s plans for an expensive live action series based on the works of Lord of the Rings author J.R.R. Tolkien. We’re going to focus on the second option, partly because it’s implied to be more of a movie thing, and because Warner Bros has been going after big directors like Jackson for their DC Comics properties lately (Steven Spielberg on Blackhawk, Ava DuVernay on New Gods, etc.). What DC Comics project Peter Jackson could be considering is anyone’s guess, but this writer thinks it might be Neil Gaiman’s Sandman, which, like Lord of the Rings (and Warner Bros’ Harry Potter), is a sprawling fantasy epic which could also be adapted into a 19-hour 6 movie franchise.2. QUENTIN TARANTINO’S ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD ATTRACTS FIVE MORE STARS(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)In the early coverage of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, most of the attention has gone to the “A-list stars” like Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt (the film’s two fictional leads), and Margot Robbie (as the real life Manson Family victim Sharon Tate). This week, however, the ensemble cast grew considerably as five more names were thrown into the mix, and 60% of them are former Tarantino leads. The most surprising new actor to join Tarantino’s stable of talent, however, is 82-year-old Burt Reynolds, one of the biggest marquee stars of Tarantino’s favorite decade (the 1970s), as well as an Academy Award nominee for Boogie Nights. Reynolds will play George Spahn, the elderly rancher who allowed Charles Manson and his cult members to live on his ranch, whence they carried out their evil crimes. Reynolds will also be joined by Kurt Russell (Death Proof), Tim Roth (Pulp Fiction), Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs) (all three of whom were also in The Hateful Eight), and Tarantino newcomer Timothy Olyphant (Deadwood, Justified,&nbsp;Santa Clarita Diet). Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is scheduled for August 9th, 2019, the 50th anniversary of the Sharon Tate murders.3. ANNETTE BENING TO PLAY CAPTAIN MARVEL’S MOM (PROBABLY)(Photo by Suzanne Tenner/Focus Features courtesy Everett Collection)In addition to the stars Marvel Studios casts as its title heroes,&nbsp;they’ve also peppered their films with impressive prestige actors in supporting roles (Glenn Close, Robert Redford, and the surprise actor in Avengers: Infinity War). Next year’s Captain Marvel is taking the MCU back to the 1990s, and the film already has an impressive ensemble cast which includes newcomers Brie Larson, Jude Law, and Ben Mendelsohn joined by returning actors like Samuel L. Jackson, Clark Gregg, Lee Pace, and Djimon Hounsou (possibly because it’s set in the 1990s). The Captain Marvel cast grew by one more star this week, as four-time Academy Award nominee Annette Bening has been cast, possibly a scientist, and almost certainly as Captain Marvel’s mom. Captain Marvel is scheduled for release on March 8, 2019, a little under two months before Avengers 4 is released on May 3, 2019. In related news, Disney CEO Bob Iger teased this week that Marvel Studios’ future will include a “new franchise” (which might be Fantastic Four, X-Men, or something else entirely).4.&nbsp;CHANCE THE RAPPER AND&nbsp;SAM ROCKWELL JOIN ANIMATED MUSICAL SEQUEL TROLLS 2(Photo by Steven Ferdman, Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)DreamWorks’ 2016 animated musical toy franchise adaptation Trolls was a big enough box office hit ($346 million globally) that a sequel was quickly put into development for release in April, 2020. Trolls had an impressive voice cast that included Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake in the lead roles, along with Russell Brand, James Corden, Zooey Deschanel, and many others. We now know that two of the new voice actors that are joining the franchise with Trolls 2 are Chance the Rapper and recent Academy Award winner Sam Rockwell (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri). As would be expected in an animated movie musical, both&nbsp;Chance and Rockwell will also be recording songs for the movie’s soundtrack. We also learned this week that this spring’s Peter Rabbit has apparently done enough box office ($327 million globally and counting) to also warrant a sequel, Peter Rabbit 2, which is also scheduled for early 2020 (February 7th, 2020, to be precise). New cast members for Peter Rabbit 2 haven’t been announced yet.5. FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS TO BE ADAPTED FOR THE FOURTH TIME(Photo by NBC)Most books (especially not non-fiction books) never get adapted into any sort of media, but every once in a while, there is a crazy exception like Friday Night Lights. Fully titled Friday Night Lights: A Town, A Team, and A Dream, the 1990 non-fiction book by H.G. Bissinger was first adapted as a 1993 TV series called Against the Grain (starring Ben Affleck), before also inspiring the 2004 film Friday Night Lights and the 2006-2011 TV series also called Friday Night Lights. Universal Pictures is now preparing for a fourth adaptation of Bissinger’s book about Texas high school football with the news that the studio has hired director David Gordon Green for the job. David Gordon Green is a prolific writer-director who got started with indie films like George Washington and All the Real Girls before expanding into James Franco comedies like Pineapple Express and Your Highness, and most recently, the Boston Marathon bombing true story Stronger.6.&nbsp;BILL &amp; TED TO (BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER AND) FACE THE MUSIC(Photo by Orion courtesy Everett Collection)This was a movie news week in which a few of the projects addressed are decidedly old school (like the talk about Rambo V, and the teaser trailer for The Predator). Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure, though the film’s riffs on Jeff Spicoli make it seem almost a decade older yet. The third movie in the franchise, Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music, is now being sold at Cannes, with Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter both returning. Co-writer Ed Solomon (Men in Black) has already been interviewed at length, and he explained that it involves the 50-something Bill &amp; Ted traveling to the future to steal the song that they’re supposed to compose to saves the world, after decades of failing to actually compose it themselves, creating a Christmas Carol-style time travel narrative riff. Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music will be directed by Dean Parisot (Galaxy Quest), whose Tomatometer is mostly Rotten, even if a lot of wouldn’t mind another adventure with&nbsp;Wyld Stallyns.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. JOHN LITHGOW&nbsp;JOINS&nbsp;THE PET SEMATARY REMAKE(Photo by Suzanne Hanover/Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Ever since last year’s adaptation of (half of) Stephen King’s IT earned over $700 million worldwide, most long-in-development Stephen King adaptations that had been collecting dust in someone’s screenplay drawer are now quickly being put into production. One of the projects that apparently was closest to getting a greenlight was Paramount Pictures’ remake of Pet Sematary, which the studio first adapted in 1989 (Rotten at 48% ). The news broke a few weeks ago that Zero Dark Thirty and Chappaquiddick star Jason Clarke will star in the Pet Sematary remake as the doctor whose grief leads him to start planting corpses in the titiular spooky site. Clarke also starred in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and his new cast member, John Lithgow, co-starred in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. John Lithgow has taken the role of Jud Crandall, the local who warns his new neighbor about the dangers of the Pet Sematary. Paramount Pictures has scheduled Pet Sematary for April 19, 2019, when it is currently scheduled against the toy adaptation Playmobil&nbsp;and the Will Smith action comedy Spies in Disguise.2. THREEQUELS FOR 2020: BAD BOYS FOR LIFE AND SHERLOCK HOLMES 3(Photo by Columbia courtesy Everett Collection)In 1995, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence first teamed up for the action comedy Bad Boys (42%), which was then followed in 2003 by the sequel Bad Boys II (23%). That means it’ll now be 25&nbsp;years between Bad Boys and the third film, called Bad Boys For Life. That movie was actually first scheduled for February 17, 2017 (which obviously didn’t happen), and the new release date now is January 17th, 2020. (Keep in mind how awesome “January movies” sometimes are.) Bad Boys For Life will also be joined by another “threequel” in 2020, as Warner Bros has also scheduled their Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law film Sherlock Holmes 3 for Christmas Day of that year.1. RYAN REYNOLDS AND SLJ GETTING ANOTHER FRANCHISE WITH THE HITMAN’S WIFE’S BODYGUARD(Photo by Jack English/Summit Entertainment)Last summer’s The Hitman’s Bodyguard may have been made on a budget of just $30 million, but it also had the benefit of two Marvel stars in Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool) and Samuel L. Jackson (Marvel Studios’ Nick Fury). So, the $176 million that The Hitman’s Bodyguard earned is a much bigger deal in relation to its budget than, say,&nbsp;if it had been&nbsp;a typical $120 million tentpole. All of that is probably a big part of the reasoning behind the revelation at this week’s Cannes Film Market that Millennium Films is now developing a sequel to be called The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard. Samuel L. Jackson (the Hitman), Salma Hayek (the Wife), and Ryan Reynolds (the Bodyguard) are all expected to return for The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard. Other sequels Millennium Films has planned include Angel Has Fallen (the third movie after Olympus Has Fallen and London Has Fallen), The Mechanic 3, Rambo V, and The Expendables 3.

IT was both Certified Fresh at 85%&nbsp;and a tremendous box office hit, earning $700+ million worldwide from a budget of just $35 million. That means Stephen King titles are hot commodities again, especially if they’re remakes (like Pet Sematary, 4/5/2019), or otherwise related to a pre-existing horror classic. The latter leads us to Doctor Sleep, the 2013 novel by Stephen King that&nbsp;serves as a sequel to The Shining,&nbsp;as it focuses on the adult Danny Torrance. Danny Lloyd, the original child actor, is now a long-retired-from-acting biology professor, so obviously Warner Bros needs a new Danny Torrance. (Shelley DuVall also retired from acting in 2002.) Ewan McGregor has landed that role in Doctor Sleep, with Stephen King himself reportedly having given his blessing to the casting choice. The sequel will be directed by Mike Flanagan&nbsp;(Ouija: Origin of Evil), who also recently directed the Stephen King adaptation Gerald’s Game for Netflix.&nbsp;Doctor Sleep will be McGregor’s 8th prequel/sequel, after the three Star Wars prequels, Angels &amp; Demons, Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang, T2: Trainspotting, and this summer’s Christopher Robin. In related news, “Old Spice Guy” Isaiah Mustafa has also been cast as the adult Mike Hanlon in next year’s IT: Chapter Two (9/6/2019).Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;JAMES MARSDEN JOINS TARANTINO’S&nbsp;ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)For all the time we’ve known that Quentin Tarantino’s ninth film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, was set in Los Angeles with the Sharon Tate murder as a backdrop, one casting mystery we’ve&nbsp;yet to solve&nbsp;is who will play Charles Manson. (Margot Robbie’s playing Sharon Tate herself, and Dakota Fanning was cast last week as Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme.) The film, like many of Tarantino’s, is going to have a huge ensemble cast, so we’ve been getting nearly weekly casting updates, and this week was no different, with the addition of James Marsden (X-Men, HBO’s Westworld). How Marsden’s casting is being covered suggests more mystery than other recent additions, which is leading to speculation that he has, in fact, been cast as Charles Manson. Roman Polanski also hasn’t been cast yet, but Marsden bears more of a resemblance to Manson, and presumably, the Polanski role is Tarantino regular Christoph Waltz’s to play or turn down. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Emile Hirsch, Damian Lewis, Timothy Olyphant, Al Pacino, Luke Perry, Burt Reynolds, and others) is scheduled for August 9th, 2019, the 50th anniversary of the Tate Murders.2. THIS WEEK IN GAL GADOT: RED NOTICE (WITH DWAYNE JOHNSON) AND WONDER WOMAN 1984(Photo by RCF/Everett Collection)Gal Gadot is currently busy filming the sequel which we now know is called Wonder Woman 1984, but “her people” are already actively lining up more future films. Gadot’s first major non-DC-Comics action movie since Wonder Woman&nbsp;will be Universal Pictures’ Red Notice, starring Dwayne Johnson. We last heard about Red Notice in February when Universal acquired the project in a bidding war that made it the year’s biggest deal so far. Red Notice reunites Dwayne Johnson with his Skyscraper and Central Intelligence director Rawson Marshall Thurber, and it also has DCEU connections, as Johnson himself is attached to star in the DC Comics adaptation Black Adam (playing an anti-hero with ties to next year’s Shazam). Going back to Wonder Woman 1984 (11/1/2019), Warner Bros.&nbsp;released the first images this week, and they reveal that Chris Pine is back for the sequel, which is set nearly seventy years after the first film. There are a variety of ways that Chris Pine could be back&nbsp;in Wonder Woman 1984, but the most obvious comes to us from the classic Wonder Woman TV show, in which the same actor played two relatives both named Steve Trevor (possibly a grandson or great nephew). Warner Bros also unveiled new images from December’s Aquaman (12/21/2018), featuring the villain Black Manta and members of the Atlantis royal family.3. CAPTAIN MARVEL “SCORES” FIRST FEMALE COMPOSER ON MAJOR SUPERHERO MOVIE(Photo by Fred Hayes/Getty Images)Captain Marvel has already been a movie of “firsts” for Marvel Studios, as it’s their first female solo movie, with their first female (co-)director, and their first prequel. As the film nears its final days of filming, Marvel is already preparing for post-production, and a key role in that process is the score. To that end, Marvel Studios made history this week with the hiring of film and TV composer Pinar Toprak. Toprak’s key distinction on Captain Marvel is that she will be the first female composer to ever score a major superhero movie (though she did contribute some music to Justice League). Marvel Studios has scheduled Captain Marvel for release on March 8th, 2019, when no other film is scheduled (would you take Marvel on directly?).4.&nbsp;SPIDER HORROR-COMEDY ARACHNOPHOBIA WEB-SPINNING A REMAKE(Photo by Buena Vista courtesy Everett Collection)We’ve seen fewer remake announcements in recent months, but the industry is slowly moving on from the 1980s into the 1990s. With that in mind,&nbsp;we now have talk of an Arachnophobia remake. Although the original 1990 Arachnophobia did “okay” at the box office (opening at #3 and earning $53 million), it’s also arguably a film whose legacy has been lost to time, as it did not receive a sequel, TV series spinoff, etc. Jeff Daniels and John Goodman starred in the original thriller, which&nbsp;followed the residents of a small California town dealing with an infestation of deadly&nbsp;Amazonian spider hybrids. The Arachnophobia remake will be a co-production between Steven Spielberg’s Amblin and Atomic Monster, the production company of director James Wan (Insidious, Aquaman). Wan will guide the remake as producer, but he won’t be directing. The next movie from Atomic Monster will be The Nun (9/7/2018), the latest entry in the Conjuring-verse.5.&nbsp;DC COMICS MOVIES UPDATE: THE FLASH, THE JOKER, GREEN LANTERN CORPS(Photo by Warner Bros.)Marvel Studios is currently filming Captain Marvel, with the Spider-Man: Homecoming sequel next up, but otherwise, the studio is currently&nbsp;in something of a “slow” period (and they won’t be doing a big San Diego Comic-Con panel either). On the other hand, this was a fairly active week for Warner Bros’ DC Comics movies, with at least five of their projects making news. You can read about The Batman and Wonder Woman 1984 elsewhere in this Ketchup, so let’s focus here on the three other films. Most of these come from a story in The Hollywood Reporter about the changes underway at Warner Bros. since their DC Entertainment unit got a new president. The Flash, starring Ezra Miller, is still in development, but it has now abandoned any “somber themes,” as the Game Night co-directors are instead using Back to the Future as a “touchstone.” Todd Phillips (The Hangover) is also still working on his “origin story” for The Joker (possibly featuring Joaquin Phoenix), and it might even start filming this fall. The surprising news, however, is that the budget is expected to be a mere $55 million, which is way, way, way below what we usually see for movies in its genre these days. Finally, Geoff Johns is stepping down from his role at DC Comics to focus more on the movie business, and the first of those projects will be Green Lantern Corps, which, as the title suggests, is expected to feature various members of the titular intergalactic police force.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4.&nbsp;FREQUENT JENNIFER LAWRENCE DIRECTOR TAKING ON THE HULK HOGAN STORY (SORT OF)(Photo by New Line Cinema)If it feels like a while since you read a story on Gawker, you can (partly) thank former professional wrestler Terry “Hulk Hogan” Bollea for that. In 2016, Bollea won a $140 million defamation case against Gawker Media, effectively shutting down the publisher of multiple blogs and websites. That story was recently adapted as the Ryan Holiday book&nbsp;Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue, and now that book is looking likely to become the inspiration for a major motion picture. Director Francis Lawrence has signed on to that adaptation, which seems like a departure from his previous films. Francis Lawrence is best known for big budget movies&nbsp;like Constantine and I Am Legend, and for working with Jennifer Lawrence four times (the last three Hunger Games movies, plus Red Sparrow). With this Hulk Hogan/Gawker project, Lawrence may be looking to tilt his career more towards an awards-friendly fact-based drama.3. BEN AFFLECK LIKELY OUT AS THE BATMAN IN FAVOR OF A YOUNGER ACTOR(Photo by Zack Snyder/Warner Bros.)Whether or not he carried any of the blame for the Rotten scores that&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (27%) and Justice League (40%) earned, Ben Affleck was at the center of some unfortunate news concerning his version of Batman this week. The latest screenplay draft of The Batman reportedly focuses on a younger version of the character, so Affleck is now “likely out” as Batman in future movies. The move is part of a shift at Warner Bros. as the focus changes to a tone closer to Wonder Woman, this year’s Aquaman, and next year’s Shazam. Meanwhile, Affleck is keeping busy with non-Batman projects, including the hopefully not too on-the-nose-titled&nbsp;The Has-Been, which reunites Affleck with The Accountant director Gavin O’Connor. Affleck will play a former professional basketball star struggling with addiction who “attempts to regain his soul” by coaching a high school team.2.&nbsp;JOHN CENA REPLACING SYLVESTER STALLONE IN JACKIE CHAN’S PROJECT X(Photo by Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures)Until this week, the action thriller now known as Project X seemed like a complete 1980s throwback, featuring two stars with an average age of 67.&nbsp;64-year-old Jackie Chan remains attached to Project X, but he will now be joined by professional wrestler-turned-actor John Cena. Project X (formerly called Ex-Baghdad) is about a Chinese security contractor and a former U.S. marine who team up to extract workers from an oil refinery and stop a criminal plot to steal the plant’s oil. Cena replaces Sylvester Stallone, the other aforementioned 1980s action movie star (who was also in the news this week for this). He’s also still attached to star in Universal Pictures’ The Janson Directive, a Robert Ludlum adaptation that Dwayne Johnson was previously attached to star in (and who is still executive producing). Project X will be directed by Scott Waugh, whose previous films as director all have Rotten Tomatometer scores (Act of Valor&nbsp;at 26%, Need for Speed&nbsp;at 22%, 6 Below&nbsp;at 24%).1.&nbsp;JAMES CORDEN’S COMPUTER KARAOKE AND MELISSA MCCARTHY’S SUPER INTELLIGENCE(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Late night talk show host James Corden (CBS’ The Late Late Show with James Corden) has had a number of live action film roles (Begin Again, Into the Woods, Ocean’s 8), but his biggest feature film successes have arguably been voice roles (Trolls, The Emoji Movie, Peter Rabbit). This week, Corden signed on for another voice role,&nbsp;this time in an otherwise live-action movie, as the title “character” in Super Intelligence, the next comedy from the wife-husband team of Melissa McCarthy and director Ben Falcone. McCarthy will star&nbsp;as “a former corporate executive whose earnest, yet unfulfilled, life is turned upside down when she is selected for observation by the world’s first superintelligence (Corden) — a form of artificial intelligence that may or may not take over the world.”&nbsp;As a director, Falcone has had a 3-for-3 streak of Rotten scores when working with McCarthy (24% for Tammy, 22% for The Boss, 38% for Life of the Party), which is why Super Intelligence is this week’s Rotten Idea. Super Intelligence is scheduled for release&nbsp;on December 25th, 2019 (five days after Star Wars Episode IX and the Wicked movie).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Skip, 2020, satire, Guide, YouTube, Mary, Comic, Land, movies, CMT, talk, die, trailers, transformers, Women's","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/15150249/Ewan-McGregor-Doctor-Sleep-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"ewan-mcgregor-to-star-in-the-shining-sequel-doctor-sleep-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509185850713","title":"The 12 Most Rotten Movie News Items of 2017","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 12 Most Rotten Movie News Items of 2017We look back at the worst stories of the year, from January to December.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 29, 2017 |  CommentsLast week, we reviewed 12 of the year’s top “Fresh Development” stories, so this week, we’re looking at each month’s most Rotten Ideas, and the biggest one of the year was…MOST ROTTEN STORY OF THE YEARSUICIDE SQUAD 2 IS STILL HAPPENING(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)This summer, audiences and critics alike celebrated the box office and critical success (Certified Fresh at 92%) of Wonder Woman, which seemed to represent a new path for Warner Bros’ DC Comics adaptations. Neither of 2016’s DCEU movies did well on the Tomatometer: Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (27%) and Suicide Squad (25%). And yet, Warner Bros is still moving forward with a Suicide Squad sequel. We know that because the news broke in July that director Jaume Collet-Serra is the frontrunner for the job. His track record on the Tomatometer is not super encouraging, with five Rotten efforts outnumbering the two Fresh scores he received for Run All Night and The Shallows. Suicide Squad 2 will presumably feature Margot Robbie returning as Harley Quinn, but that’s just the tip of DC’s commitment to milking Robbie’s popularity for all it’s worth.Other Rotten IdeasJANUARY: PATRICK STEWART WILL VOICE THE POOP EMOJI(Photo by Paramount Pictures)We get it, an actor’s got bills to pay, fun real estate to purchase, etc. One would think, however, that Sir Patrick Stewart should be pretty much set, with both the Star Trek: The Next Generation and the X-Men franchises presumably filling his coffers with riches. So, considering Stewart is mortal like us all, and only has so many years left to turn in quality work, it was&nbsp;a little&nbsp;frustrating to hear that he made the sort of “cash grab” that January’s news reported. Movie stars are prone sign on for projects we might consider “crap” from time to time, but this week’s announcement takes that quite literally. Sony Pictures took to their Twitter account back in January to announce that Patrick Stewart will be providing the voice of the Poop Emoji in The Emoji Movie,&nbsp;which eventually opened on August 4th, 2017, earning one of RT’s lowest Tomatometer scores for a wide release movie with a measly 9%.FEBRUARY: HOLLYWOOD WELCOMED BACK MEL GIBSON… SO HE COULD COSTAR IN DADDY’S HOME 2?(Photo by Paramount Pictures)When the 2017 Academy Award nominations were announced early this year, one of the big takeaways was that “Hollywood has officially forgiven Mel Gibson.” Put in terms of film development news, that meant that movies directed by Mel Gibson would have a better chance of being produced by studios again, and that he was once again in the running for roles produced by mainstream Hollywood.&nbsp; That acceptance went to the next level when Mel Gibson was officially cast by Paramount Pictures to co-star in Daddy’s Home 2, their sequel to the 2015 comedy Daddy’s Home (Rotten at 31%), starring Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell. Daddy’s Home 2 did pretty good box office business, but earned a Rotten 19% Tomatometer score. Another Christmas sequel that made the news in early 2017 and released in late 2017 was A Bad Moms Christmas (Rotten at 29%).MARCH: NETFLIX SAYS “CRITICS, SHMITICS! GIVE US SOME MORE ADAM SANDLER (AND BRIGHT)!”(Photo by Columbia Pictures)Although Netflix receives a lot of critical love from hits like Stranger Things, the streaming service also has shown a willingness to produce movies,&nbsp;some of which don’t necessarily need to appeal to critics. The first and biggest deal they made was with Adam Sandler for four movies, which started with The Ridiculous Six (0%), The Do Over (5%), and Sandy Wexler (32%), with The Week Of coming in early 2018. Regardless of those three movies earning an average Tomatometer score of 12%, and The Meyerowitz Stories notwithstanding,&nbsp;Netflix revealed in March that they had signed Sandler for another four movies. Within a few years, we will have more Adam Sandler movies made for Netflix than there are Peter Jackson movies based on J.R.R. Tolkien books, or than there are in the Jason Bourne, Mission: Impossible, or Spider-Man franchises. In closing, we leave you with Adam Sandler’s Tomatometer,&nbsp;which pretty much speaks for itself.APRIL: MICHAEL BAY PROMISES/THREATENS 14 MORE TRANSFORMERS MOVIES(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Although Michael Bay’s first Transformers movie in 2007 did come within three points of being Fresh,&nbsp;its three sequels have all been even more Rotten. Talking to MTV in April, Bay (who is stepping down as franchise director after the fifth movie) mentioned that last year’s “writers room” project had led to Paramount&nbsp;developing&nbsp;14 potential Transformers movies for the future. For those keeping count, 14 movies on top of the five we have right now would be a total of nineteen Transformers movies. As for what these movies might be, there appear to be three options: the “main Transformers” movies (like The Last Knight), the spinoffs (like next December’s Bumblebee) (12/21/18), and crossovers (like the rumored movie connecting to a new G.I. Joe reboot).&nbsp; The question now is whether or not&nbsp;any of them will&nbsp;ever receive Fresh Tomatometer score.MAY: TYLER PERRY’S TYLER PERRY’S BOO: A MADEA HALLOWEEN&nbsp;GOT A SEQUEL(Photo by Daniel McFadden/Lionsgate)One of the most surprising release date announcements in early 2016 was the revelation that Tyler Perry was indeed turning the “joke” movie Tyler Perry’s Boo: A Madea Halloween (from Chris Rock’s Top Five) into an actual movie&nbsp;that would see a theatrical release and everything. Well, this year, we received another such surprise&nbsp;when Lionsgate announced that Perry’s Madea character would return in another Halloween “horror” comedy, scheduled for October 20, 2017. This time around, “Madea, Bam, and Hattie venture to a haunted campground and the group must literally run for their lives when monsters, goblins, and the bogeyman are unleashed.” If you don’t count 2009’s I Can Do Bad All By Myself, the highest a Madea movie (proper) has ever scored on the Tomatometer is 38% (2011’s Madea’s Big Happy Family).&nbsp;Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween earned a Rotten score even lower than Tyler Perry’s usual results, with just a 6% Tomatometer score.JUNE: CHRIS EVANS HANGING UP CAPTAIN AMERICA’S SHIELD AFTER AVENGERS 4 IN 2019(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)In early 2017, there was some intimation from Chris Evans that he might soon be hanging up his shield as Marvel’s Captain America. However, there were also statements like this, which suggested an absolute end date to Evans playing the character was still unknown. In June, Evans spoke more authoritatively on the issue,&nbsp;naming the fourth Avengers movie (scheduled for May 3, 2019, and not&nbsp;to be confused with 2018’s&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War) as his last film as Captain America. Said Evans, “I had six films in my Marvel contract, so I could have said after the third Avengers I was done, but they wanted to make the third and fourth Avengers films as a two-parter. They said they had so many other characters to fit in – Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man – and couldn’t get them all into one movie. [I agreed] because it made sense. It’s going to wrap everything up.” (Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel is scheduled for release in between Avengers: Infinity War and the fourth Avengers movie on March 8, 2019.)AUGUST: ROTTEN&nbsp;SCORE FOR THE DARK TOWER CASTS LONG SHADOW OVER SPINOFF TV SERIES(Photo by Ilze Kitshoff/Columbia Pictures)Before the initial weekend box office results were even in yet, the Tomatometer score for The Dark Tower&nbsp;tagged it as a certified stinker, with a Rotten score of just 17%. Even so, reports confirmed that the long-in-development plans for a Dark Tower TV series to be spun off of the feature film would still continue. The news broke the day before the movie’s release that Glen Mazzara (showrunner of TV’s The Walking Dead)&nbsp;was developing The Dark Tower as a series for Sony Pictures Television. Idris Elba, Dennis Haysbert, and Tom Taylor are all expected to reprise their roles on the 10-episode series, which is expected to debut on either cable or a streaming outlet.SEPTEMBER:&nbsp;THE LIVE-ACTION CLIFFORD THE BIG RED DOG‘S DIRECTOR AND HIS ROTTEN TOMATOMETER(Photo by Warner Bros.)Universal Pictures was trying to get a live action/CGI hybrid adaptation of the popular children’s book (and PBS TV series) character Clifford the Big Red Dog going for many years (including a period in which he was used in their promotional materials). In 2016, however, after Universal’s plans to release the film in 2016 failed to work out, Clifford the Big Red Dog&nbsp;bounded his way over to Paramount Pictures. A year later, we learned who Paramount had hired to direct Clifford the Big Red Dog, and it was Walt Becker. Becker’s Tomatometer record is remarkably Rotten;&nbsp;none of his five feature films has earned a score above 16% (Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip), and one of them scored as low as 5% (2009’s Old Dogs).OCTOBER: HOLLYWOOD’S REMAKE FEVER STILL RUNNING HOT: ACE VENTURA, MAJOR LEAGUE, AND YOUNG GUNS(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although we keep getting remakes like last month’s Flatliners that fall flat, attempts to translate that into an anti-remake narrative are deflated by remakes like IT that are huge box office successes. There are also the “remake TV shows” like The Handmaid’s Tale, Westworld, The Exorcist, and Lethal Weapon to consider. Both of those types of reboots have led the newly rebranded Morgan Creek Entertainment Group (the company behind The Exorcist) to announce their plans to revive their catalog of titles as either movie remakes, new TV shows, or possibly both. The three multi-film franchises that were mentioned are Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, the baseball comedy Major League, and the western Young Guns. The other films are mostly thrillers (Dead Ringers, Diabolique, Pacific Heights) and one horror film (Clive Barker’s Nightbreed). Ace Ventura and Young Guns are being eyed as both movie reboots and TV shows, with Dead Ringers and Nightbreed being developed as TV shows.NOVEMBER: AFTER THE MUMMY, UNIVERSAL’S CINEMATIC DARK UNIVERSE IS PROBABLY (UN)DEAD(Photo by Universal Pictures)Box office diagnostics continued as we headed into the tail end of the year (like this much-shared piece about Blade Runner 2049). Any would-be franchise obviously can get stalled by box office disappointment (Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie, for example, might be the last epic movie too). Universal’s The Mummy (with a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 16%), however,&nbsp;carried the extra burden of launching an entire “cinematic universe” for Universal (a la Marvel) called Dark Universe. Well, with the departure in November of the masterminds of that plan, namely Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan, it now appears Dark Universe may never come to be (at least not as planned). This came just a month after Universal delayed production on Bride of Frankenstein&nbsp;and canceled the film’s 2/14/19 release date. It’s still possible that some of the reboots might happen, such as The Invisible Man, Van Helsing, or The Creature from the Black Lagoon, but they may no longer be interconnected.DECEMBER:&nbsp;SIX MOVIES IN THE WORKS FOR HARLEY QUINN(Photo by Warner Bros.)As we mentioned in the Most Rotten Story above Margot Robbie is set to return as Harley Quinn in the Suicide Squad sequel. As it happens,&nbsp;Robbie herself is also stepping up to produce and develop new films for WB. In the past, we’ve heard that she was attached to reprise her role as Harley Quinn not only in&nbsp;Suicide Squad 2, but also a spinoff featuring both Harley Quinn and Jared Leto’s Joker, and&nbsp;Gotham City Sirens, also featuring Batman villains like Poison Ivy and Catwoman. If all of those movies get produced, we’d have at least four movies featuring Robbie as Harley Quinn, and in December, she announced&nbsp;plans for a fifth,&nbsp;a solo movie,&nbsp;which could actually replace some of these other films if WB wants to change priorities. Or maybe we will really have four separate franchises featuring Harley Quinn on the way. Robbie was frequently cited as one of the few bright spots in Suicide Squad, but is it a wise move on WB’s part to put all their eggs in Harley Quinn’s basket? On top of all that, there are also the multiple movies for the Joker, some&nbsp;with or without&nbsp;Jared Leto,&nbsp;with or without&nbsp;Harley Quinn. Meanwhile, DC Comics has hundreds of superheroes closer to the spirit of&nbsp;Wonder Woman&nbsp;who don’t have movie projects at all.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"blockbuster, Box, Paramount","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/29173457/Suicide-Squad-Yearly-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"the-12-most-rotten-movie-news-items-of-2017"},{"id":"47509184523607","title":"Marvel Begins Development on Black Widow Movie, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Marvel Begins Development on Black Widow Movie, and More NewsLeonardo DiCaprio officially joins Tarantino's next film, Chadwick Boseman teams up with Barry Jenkins, Natalie Portman shoots into space, and New Mutants is pushed to 2019.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 12, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;titles such as&nbsp;Black Widow, Kitty Pryde, The New Mutants, and new roles for Leonardo DiCaprio, Chadwick Boseman, and Natalie Portman.This WEEK’S TOP STORYMARVEL BEGINS DEVELOPMENT ON&nbsp;BLACK WIDOW MOVIE(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)2018 marks the 10th anniversary of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and eight years since Scarlett Johansson joined the MCU in Iron Man 2 as Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a.&nbsp;Black Widow. In the years since, we&nbsp;haven’t heard firm news of a Black Widow movie being actively developed, even as films with similar premises like last year’s Atomic Blonde&nbsp;and this year’s Red Sparrow (3/2/18) were both developed and produced. In the meantime, Black Widow’s backstory was developed further in Avengers: Age of Ultron, and she had her largest role yet in in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. With all of that in mind, Marvel Studios has officially begun development of a Black Widow movie&nbsp;by hiring female screenwriter Jac Schaeffer, who wrote and directed the 2010 romantic comedy TiMER&nbsp;(62% on the Tomatometer). Jac Schaeffer also wrote the upcoming Dirty Rotten Scoundrels remake called Nasty Women (starring Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson) and an original screenplay called The Shower. Anne Hathaway is also attached to produce and star in The Shower, which is about an alien invasion that occurs during a baby shower.Fresh Developments1. LEONARDO DICAPRIO CONFIRMED FOR QUENTIN TARANTINO’S NEXT FILM(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Ever since we first heard about Quentin Tarantino’s plans for his 9th film as director, an untitled drama set in Hollywood against the backdrop of the Manson Family murders in the summer of 1969, several big name actors have been mentioned. Friday afternoon, the news broke that the first such star to officially sign on with Sony Pictures is Leonardo DiCaprio, who previously worked with Tarantino on Django Unchained. Leonardo DiCaprio is taking the lead role, which is an aging television actor who is hoping to break more into being a big movie star, along with his longtime stuntman and friend. Tom Cruise remains one of the other stars who might be cast, but Brad Pitt wasn’t mentioned in today’s news. Margot Robbie is still in the running to play murder victim Sharon Tate (and Samuel L. Jackson is also still very much a possibility). The new name in today’s news is Al Pacino, for whom Tarantino may be specifically writing a role. Sony Pictures has scheduled the film for August 9, 2019, the 50th anniversary of the 1969 Tate murders ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate_murders ).2. BLACK PANTHER STAR CHADWICK BOSEMAN IS ALSO AN EXPATRIATE(Photo by Dale Robinette/Summit Entertainment)We’re just under a month away from the release of Marvel’s next big superhero movie, Black Panther, and already, its star Chadwick Boseman has set up a new project with one of Hollywood’s most-demanded directors. Moonlight director Barry Jenkins is now attached to Universal Pictures’ Expatriate, which Boseman co-wrote and in which he will star. Expatriate is described as an international thriller set around a 1970s airliner highjacking. This Expatriate news comes as Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World is still in theaters, telling another 1970s crime story (though it appears Expatriate is probably fictional). Yet another 1970s-set project suffered worse news this week, as 20th Century Fox has scrapped American Heiress, the Patricia “Patty” Hearst biopic. The news came within hours of Patricia Hearst denouncing American Heiress and an upcoming CNN miniseries.3.&nbsp;DEADPOOL DIRECTOR UN-“PHASED” BY KITTY PRYDE OPPORTUNITYAs of this writing, there have been only three superhero movies featuring solo female leads: Catwoman, Elektra, and last year’s Wonder Woman, with Captain Marvel (3/8/19) to be #4. (Sony Pictures’ Silver &amp; Black (2/8/19), about Marvel’s Silver Sable and Black Cat, will be the first superhero movie to feature two female leads.) With movies like X-Men: Dark Phoenix and The New Mutants&nbsp;coming soon, Fox is clearly focusing on female superheroes. This week, we learned which might be the first female X-Men member to go solo, as director Tim Miller (Deadpool) is now developing a solo movie for Kitty Pryde (most commonly AKA Shadowcat). Kitty Pryde, who was played by Ellen Page in two films (after being played by other actresses in the first two), possesses&nbsp;the ability to “phase” through solid objects (like walls). In the comics, Kitty Pryde has had a long, on-again-off-again romantic relationship with Colossus (and also dated Star-Lord for a while), learned martial arts from Wolverine, and is currently the leader of one of the X-Men teams. Director Tim Miller is also developing the next Terminator reboot.4. NATALIE PORTMAN TO LAUNCH INTO ASTRONAUT DRAMA PALE BLUE DOT(Photo by Paramount Pictures)After Sandra Bullock’s success with Gravity, Reese Witherspoon also became attached to star in an astronaut drama called Pale Blue Dot. Witherspoon is still producing Pale Blue Dot, but it is now Natalie Portman who is in talks with Fox Searchlight to star. Incidentally, it’s worth noting&nbsp;that, at one time, Natalie Portman had been attached to star in Gravity before Sandra Bullock eventually was cast. Pale Blue Dot tells the (fictional) story of a married female astronaut who has an affair with a fellow astronaut after an extended stay in space&nbsp;and must deal with the repercussions when her lover becomes involved&nbsp;with a young astronaut trainee. Reportedly loosely based on the 2007 case of astronaut Lisa Nowak,&nbsp;Pale Blue Dot will mark the feature film directorial debut of Noah Hawley, the creator of the acclaimed FX TV series&nbsp;Fargo and Legion. Hawley is also developing a Doctor Doom solo movie.5. MILLIE BOBBY BROWN TO INVESTIGATE ENOLA HOLMES MYSTERIES(Photo by Netflix)Since they’re on such a phenomenally popular Netflix series, the young stars of Stranger Things are obviously going to be&nbsp;sought after for other projects. However, due to their ages and the specific ages of their characters, their careers are, for the time being, largely and necessarily tied to the show. Millie Bobby Brown, who plays Eleven, did fit next year’s Godzilla: King of Monsters (3/22/19) in between S1 and S2, and now we know what might fit in between S3 (which starts filming soon) and S4. Millie Bobby Brown is now signed with Legendary Entertainment (the company behind Godzilla: King of Monsters) to star in a series of films based on the Enola Holmes Mysteries by author Nancy Springer. As the title suggests, Enola is the (much) younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes who has been featured in six young adult novels since 2006.6. TARAJI P. HENSON TO STAR AS EMMETT TILL’S MOTHER(Photo by Bob Mahoney/Focus World)One of the new movies opening this weekend is Proud Mary (currently 33% on the Tomatometer), starring Taraji P. Henson, and so we heard this week about one of Henson’s next new projects. We now know that Henson will produce and star in an untitled biopic about the life and death of Emmett Till. Emmett Till was a 14-year-old boy who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955 after being accused of whistling at a white woman (who has since recanted her story). Henson will play Emmett’s mother Mamie Till-Mobley, whose decision to demand an open casket for her son is credited as a key moment in the civil rights struggle. We also learned this week about another new biopic based on the life of Hattie McDaniel, the first African-American to be nominated or win an acting Academy Award, for her role as the slave “Mammy” in Gone with the Wind.7. VIN DIESEL TAKES AIM AT VALIANT COMICS’ BLOODSHOT(Photo by George Kraychyk/Paramount Pictures)Even people who don’t follow comic books probably know by this point that the two biggest companies are Marvel and DC, and that they have competing “cinematic universes.” Since 2015, however, another publisher, Valiant Comics, has also been developing movies based on some of their comic book series, including Archer &amp; Armstrong, Harbinger, and X-O Manowar. The first of Valiant’s movies to actually receive any sort of casting news is Bloodshot, for which Vin Diesel is now in talks with Sony Pictures. (Last year, Jared Leto had also reportedly been considered). Bloodshot is about “a mortally wounded soldier resurrected with cutting-edge nanotechnology and tasked with rounding up superpowered outcasts known as ‘harbingers.'” Bloodshot will mark the directorial debut of Dave Wilson (a producing partner of Deadpool director Tim Miller), and is expected to be an R-rated action movie. If Vin Diesel signs on, Bloodshot will be his second comic book adaptation after voicing Groot in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy movies.8. THIS WEEK IN DC COMICS MOVIES: SHAZAM! RELEASE DATE; TEEN TITANS GO! TO THE MOVIES TRAILER(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)The next three DC Comics superhero movies will be Teen Titans Go! to the Movies (7/27/18), Aquaman (12/21/18), and Shazam! (4/5/19). This week, two of them were in the news (and the third was mentioned as well). If you’ve not been following recent developments, you might be surprised by that first title, which is a big screen animated adaptation of the popular TV series on the Cartoon Network. The first teaser trailer debuted online this week, and it featured the Teen Titans&nbsp;both commenting on the popularity of Wonder Woman and offering a friendly jab at the idea of the necessity of an Aquaman movie. Warner Bros. also confirmed this week that the “Untitled DC Comics” title that had been scheduled for April 5, 2019 will indeed be Shazam! (as one could have guessed, based on its being the next movie in production after Aquaman).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK?1. THE NEW MUTANTS PUSHED BACK NEARLY A YEAR(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Fox’s X-Men spinoff The New Mutants had been scheduled to come out in just three months on April 13, 2018. This week, however, the studio announced three release date changes, and&nbsp;The New Mutants&nbsp;was pushed back over ten months to February 22, 2019. One of the rumored reasons for the move is that Fox may be considering re-shoots to emphasize the film’s horror elements. Fox also moved Deadpool 2 (which may get a new title) up two weeks from June 1st to May 18, 2018, putting it just a week before new corporate boss Disney’s Solo: A Star Wars Story. (Presuming that prequel, which doesn’t have a trailer yet, retains that date.) Finally, there is Gambit, which lost its third attached director to date this week —&nbsp;if you’ve lost count, it was Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl). The other two directors who had been previously attached were Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) and Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity). Verbinski’s departure is no doubt part of the reason for the Gambit release date change, which is from February, 2019 to June 7, 2019 (putting it up against the Charlie’s Angels reboot and The Secret Life of Pets 2). Channing Tatum remains attached to star in Gambit.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"WarnerMedia, Creative, USA, laika, football, service, teaser, The, archives, game-of-thrones, Biopics, Freeform, Trailer","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/12192043/Scarlett-Johansson-Black-Widow-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"marvel-begins-development-on-black-widow-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509184521558","title":"Spielberg Sets His Sights on Indiana Jones 5 and West Side Story, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Spielberg Sets His Sights on Indiana Jones 5 and West Side Story, and More NewsIce Cube's Oliver Twist musical moves forward, Creed 2 secures Drago spawn, new roles for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rachel Weisz, Jessica Chastain, and Octavia Spencer.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 19, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;titles such as Creed II, Indiana Jones 5, and remakes of Oliver Twist, The Sword in the Stone, and West Side Story.This WEEK’S TOP STORYSTEVEN SPIELBERG SETS SIGHTS ON INDIANA JONES 5 AND REMAKING WEST SIDE STORYRyan FujitaniWe are currently in between the releases of the two latest films from acclaimed director Steven Spielberg: The Post (his prestige film about the Pentagon Papers with Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep) and his adaptation of the popular science fiction novel Ready Player One (3/30/18). Throughout his career, Spielberg has frequently scheduled his films in pairs like that, and this week, we learned which projects will likely be&nbsp;his next two. Although&nbsp;he does have other options (like The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara, with Oscar Isaac), the two most likely movies are both huge and ambitious.&nbsp;First,&nbsp;Spielberg is reportedly ready to direct the fifth Indiana Jones, which has already been written by David Koepp (who also previously worked with Spielberg on Jurassic Park,&nbsp;War of the Worlds, and&nbsp;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), and which will presumably be Harrison Ford’s final film in the role (a la&nbsp;Star Wars: The Force Awakens). The other project that Spielberg might&nbsp;take on is a remake of the classic 1961 musical West Side Story. It’s unclear if the West Side Story remake will be a contemporary modernization or whether it will feature new and updated music or the same jazzy style of singing and dancing.Fresh Developments1. MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD JOINS WILL SMITH’S GEMINI MAN(Photo by Chris Large/FX)If you follow film development news, you&nbsp;know that some films&nbsp;can take years and years to make it to the big screen.&nbsp;The action movie called Gemini Man, for example, has been in the works since the 1990s. Paramount Pictures is finally getting Gemini Man going, though, with Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) attached to direct and Will Smith&nbsp;starring as an aging hitman who finds out that the young assassin hired to take him out is… a younger clone of himself (presumably, motion capture will be used). This week, we found out who two of Smith’s co-stars will be, starting with the female lead (an operative ordered to watch the hitman). After an initial story that Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) was in the running, the role instead went to Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Scott Pilgrim vs the World, 10 Cloverfield Lane, FX’s Fargo). Clive Owen (The Bourne Identity) was also cast this week as the scientist in charge of the cloning program.2.&nbsp;THIS IS US STANDOUT RON CEPHAS JONES CAST AS THE WIZARD IN SHAZAM!(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Fans of NBC’s This is Us may have their own favorite characters and performers, but one of the standouts has been Ron Cephas Jones, who plays the biological father of Sterling K. Brown’s Randall. At 61, Jones has had a long career of supporting roles, and This is Us&nbsp;just might be the show that helps launch him to another level. Jones is now in negotiations with New Line Cinema for their ambitious DC Comics project, Shazam!, to play The Wizard, the mysterious figure who endows young Billy Batson (Asher Angel) with the superpowers of Shazam (Zachary Levi). Mark Strong (Kingsman: The Golden Circle) also confirmed this week that he will be playing the evil “mad scientist” villain Dr. Sivana. Shazam! is currently scheduled for April 5th, 2019 (the week after Disney’s Dumbo remake).3.&nbsp;EMPIRE CO-CREATOR TO ADAPT ICE CUBE’S OLIVER TWIST REMAKE(Photo by Bob Mahoney/Warner Bros.)It’s been a while now since we learned that Ice Cube is producing (and will star as Fagin in) a new movie musical based on Charles Dickens’ Oliver Twist (with Hamilton director Thomas Kail). This week, we learned the project is still on, and it’s now set up at Walt Disney Pictures (which is releasing Mary Poppins Returns from one of the project’s non-Ice Cube producers). The studio has also now hired screenwriter Danny Strong to adapt Charles Dickens’ novel for this updated musical. Strong’s previous experience with adapting books includes HBO’s Game Change and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay (Parts 1 and 2), and he also co-created the hit TV series Empire&nbsp;along with Lee Daniels (for whom he also wrote Lee Daniels’ The Butler).4. ZOMBIE MOVIE DIRECTOR DRAWN TO DISNEY’S LIVE ACTION SWORD IN THE STONEIt was just two weeks ago that the top story in The Weekly Ketchup&nbsp;involved Walt Disney Pictures possibly recruiting Ridley Scott to direct their new Merlin Saga franchise. The footnote to that story was that Disney was still actively developing a live action remake of their 1963 animated classic The Sword in the Stone, which also retells the Arthurian legends (including Merlin). The argument could be made that Scott’s reputation&nbsp;looms so large that the news overshadowed this other King Arthur project at Disney, which may be why we are now hearing about who’s been hired to direct it. Disney’s surprising choice is Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo&nbsp;(Intacto), who is probably best known for directing 28 Weeks Later, the sequel to Danny Boyle’s zombie movie 28 Days Later. Could Fresnadillo’s hiring actually suggest Disney wants a King Arthur horror movie?5. ROMANIAN BOXER TO PLAY IVAN DRAGO’S SON IN CREED 2(Photo by Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros.)The one element that most people probably remember about Rocky IV is the rah-rah-rah Cold War juxposition of Russian boxer Ivan Drago (“I must break you“) against Sylvester Stallone’s red-white-and-blue-shorts-wearing American champion. The dramatic turn that actually led to their big fight, however, was the death of Apollo Creed in the ring against Ivan Drago (sorry for spoilers from 30+ years ago?). For this year’s Creed II (11/21/18), the sequel to the Rocky spinoff starring Michael B. Jordan, the story will focus on the decades-in-the-making ramifications of Apollo’s death. This time, Jordan’s Adonis Creed character will go up against Drago’s own son, and now we know who will be playing that new Russian boxer. Romanian boxer Florian Munteanu has been confirmed to play Ivan Drago’s son in the sequel, complete with lots of images online of exactly how scary that dude looks. Dolph Lundgren, Sylvester Stallone, and Thor: Ragnarok co-star Tessa Thompson will also all reprise their Rocky franchise roles.6. RACHEL WEISZ FLOATING OFF TO INDIE SCI-FI CLOUD ONE(Photo by Focus Features courtesy Everett Collection)Indie films aren’t all just&nbsp;overly talky dramas anymore. One genre that has emerged more commonly over the last several years is science fiction, including films like Ex Machina, Monsters, Moon, Under the Skin, and Upstream Color. Croatian director Goran Dukic made his feature film debut in 2006 with the supernatural comedy&nbsp;Wristcutters: A Love Story&nbsp;(Fresh on the Tomatometer at 67%), and this week, we learned what Dukic has planned for his second feature film. Rachel Weisz (The Mummy Returns, The Lobster) is now signed to star in a “grounded sci fi movie” called Cloud One, which is expected to start filming in early 2018. Weisz’s films for 2018 will be The Mercy (with Colin Firth) and The Favourite (with Emma Stone).7. FILM PLANNED FOR AARON HERNANDEZ’S&nbsp;ALL-AMERICAN MURDER(Photo by Michael DeHoog/Getty Images)On June 17, 2013, Odin Lloyd,&nbsp;a semi-pro linebacker for the Boston Bandits American football team, was murdered in an industrial park in North Attenborough, Massachusetts. That location was also just one mile from the home of another football player, Aaron Hernandez, star tight end for the New England Patriots. Hernandez was subsequently arrested for Lloyd’s murder (and fired by the Patriots within 90 minutes) and convicted, and&nbsp; last year, Hernandez committed suicide in his prison cell at the age of 27. A new book called All-American Murder: The Rise and Fall of Aaron Hernandez, the Superstar Whose Life Ended on Murderers’ Row, won’t be published until next week, but a major Hollywood producer has already snapped up the rights to adapt it into a major motion picture. That producer is Mark Gordon,&nbsp;whose credits include Saving Private Ryan, The Day After Tomorrow, and Chris Pratt’s upcoming action movie Cowboy Ninja Viking. The upcoming book was co-written by best-selling author&nbsp;James Patterson, whose screen credits include the various “Alex Cross” movies and the CBS TV series Zoo.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2.&nbsp;OCTAVIA SPENCER AND JESSICA CHASTAIN&nbsp;REUNITE FOR&nbsp;PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES(Photo by Dale Robinette/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)There are not really that many Thanksgiving movies, and now, one of the most popular has apparently inspired (yet another) Christmas movie. Steve Martin and the late John Candy co-starred in the 1987 holiday classic Planes, Trains and Automobiles&nbsp;as two businessmen stuck&nbsp;with each other during the pre-Thanksgiving travel congestion on their way to Chicago from New York City. Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer (who previously worked together on The Help) are now attached to reunite on an untitled comedy which promises to retell the story with a twist. The as-yet-untitled holiday comedy was picked up by Universal Pictures after a bidding war&nbsp;that also included Fox and Paramount. The screenplay will now be written by screenwriter Peter Chiarelli, who previously wrote 2009’s The Proposal&nbsp;(Rotten at 44%). The reason for changing the setting away from Thanksgiving is not yet known.1. THE FLASH TO TAKE INTERDIMENSIONAL VACATION IN FLASHPOINT(Photo by James Atoa/Everett Collection)Over the last few years, there have been so many DC Comics movies&nbsp;put into development (over 20, actually) that even stalwart fans would be excused for losing count. And as movies like Justice League have yielded disappointing results (critically or financially), it’s possible that even Warner Bros. is constantly in flux about which films will move forward (especially considering this recent news). As of right now, Aquaman is wrapped (12/21/18), Shazam! is filming (4/5/19), and the third film in line will be the Wonder Woman sequel (11/1/19), but what’s next after that? One candidate is Flashpoint, the project formerly known as The Flash, in which Justice League star Ezra Miller will get his solo movie (plus also allow for an in-story narrative reboot). We now know that Flashpoint will be directed by the team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who made their directorial debuts on the 2013 reboot of National Lampoon’s&nbsp;Vacation (Rotten at 26%). As screenwriters, their other credits also include Horrible Bosses, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (Rotten at 37%).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"halloween, Academy, films, CW, Lucasfilm, emmy, dc, Moore, Paramount","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/19182731/Steven-Spielberg-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"spielberg-sets-his-sights-on-indiana-jones-5-and-west-side-story-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509184525656","title":"Ridley Scott in Talks to Direct Disney’s Merlin Saga, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ridley Scott in Talks to Direct Disney's Merlin Saga, and More Movie Newsby Greg Dean Schmitz | January 5, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you eleven headlines from the world of film development news, covering stories from the last few weeks (because of the holidays), such as G.I. Joe, Halloween, The Merlin Saga, and Quentin Tarantino’s Star Trek.This WEEK’S TOP STORYDISNEY’S MERLIN SAGA&nbsp;MIGHT BE DIRECTED BY RIDLEY SCOTT(Photo by Kerry Brown/20th Century Fox Film Corp., Walt Disney Pictures)When Disney officially acquired the 20th Century Fox film and television assets for $52.4 billion late last year, much of the emphasis was on either the potential of X-Men joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Disney acquiring properties like The Simpsons, Avatar, Die Hard, etc. However, because of Fox’s longstanding relationships with various directors and producers, another implied result was that some of those filmmakers might start making films for Disney as well. Just weeks later, it appears that’s exactly what’s happening. Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, Blade Runner) is now in talks with Walt Disney Pictures to direct their adaptation of The Merlin Saga books by author T.A. Barron. Rather than focusing on future characters like King Arthur and Lancelot, The Merlin Saga (as the title suggests) tells the story of the sorcerer Merlin when he is a young adventurer. If Ridley Scott does sign on, it’s expected The Merlin Saga (or at least, the first film in the series) could be Ridley Scott’s next film as director. This is just one of two Merlin-related projects Disney is developing, along with their live action remake of Disney’s 1963 animated film&nbsp;The Sword in the Stone.Fresh Developments1. CUE THE SPACE BEARS: TARANTINO AIMS HIS STAR TREK PHASER AT&nbsp;THE REVENANT SCREENWRITER(Photo by Derek Storm, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)It was only a month ago that the spectacularly surprising news broke that Quentin Tarantino (Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained) was considering a Star Trek movie for what might be his last film before retirement. Some stories like this disappear as quickly as they are reported, but this one seems to have traction. Tarantino met recently with a group of screenwriters to discuss his pitch (which reportedly involves time travel), and it appears that the frontrunner to land the job&nbsp;is Mark L. Smith. Smith’s previous credits include the bear attack epic The Revenant, Joe Dante’s The Hole, and the 2007 “torture porn” release Vacancy, all of which line up with Tarantino’s stated intention of delivering the first-ever R-rated Star Trek movie.2. ORIGINAL MICHAEL MYERS TO RETURN FOR OCTOBER’S NEW HALLOWEEN(Photo by Compass International Pictures)The week after the surprising box office showing of the IT remake, we learned that Jamie Lee Curtis will be returning in this October’s new Halloween (which ignores the continuity of the sequels). This week, it was revealed that director David Gordon Green (Pineapple Express, Your Highness) is also bringing back actor Nick Castle, who originally played “The Shape” (AKA Michael Myers) in the original Halloween. Castle is now 70 years old (he directed The Last Starfighter), so he will be assisted by stuntman James Jude Courtney who had already previously been cast as Michael Myers.3. GEORGE LUCAS’ PLANS FOR THE THIRD STAR WARS TRILOGY SURPRISINGLY SIMILAR TO THE LAST&nbsp;JEDI(Photo by Merrick Morton/20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Director Rian Johnson has been receiving staunch criticism from some Star Wars fans, but as it turns out, George Lucas had (somewhat) similar plans. We’re referring here to what Lucas might have done with Episodes VII (The Force Awakens), VIII (The Last Jedi), and the upcoming Episode IX if he hadn’t dropped out when Disney acquired Lucasfilm. In the new book Art of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, it’s revealed that George Lucas planned for Episode VIII to depict “an older Luke Skywalker training a new disciple named Kira (who was later renamed Rey). The idea was that, 30 years after the fall of the Empire, Luke had gone to a dark place and secluded himself in a Jedi temple on a new planet.” And that, at least, is (partially) what Rian Johnson depicted in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Well, that and showing us where Aunt Beru’s blue milk might’ve come from.4. CHRISTIAN BALE&nbsp;ALMOST STARRED IN SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Paramount Pictures)The Star Wars movies are usually promoted for months in advance of release, but the prequel Solo: A Star Wars Story releases in just over four months (5/25/18), and we haven’t seen much from it yet at all. That’s obviously going to change soon (the Super Bowl on 2/4/18 is a safe bet), but until now, we’re still just getting random bits and pieces. This week, super-serious actor Christian Bale confirmed that he had been in talks to co-star in Solo: A Star Wars Story, playing the character that went to Woody Harrelson instead. Bale not only stated that he has been a lifelong Star Wars fan (and previously worked with Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy on Empire of the Sun), but that he “hope[s] there will be future discussions.” So, the chance is still out there that Christian Bale could yet co-star in a future Star Wars movie.5.&nbsp;WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES DIRECTOR LEAVING FOX FOR NETFLIX(Photo by Mark Sagliocco/Getty Images)This story might seem a bit “inside baseball” (and/or too “corporate”), but the possible ramifications do connect to things fans care about. Matt Reeves, the director of the two most recent Planet of the Apes sequels (and still attached to direct The Batman for Warner Bros.), has moved his production company from 20th Century Fox to Netflix. What’s interesting here is that this might be an example of a director formerly associated with Fox who is now moving elsewhere because of the recent Disney/Fox deal (though it should be noted that’s pure speculation at this point). No new titles under Netflix have been revealed yet, and Reeves’ company will continue to develop the titles Mouse Guard and The Care and Feeding of a Pet Black Hole (for Fox Animation).6. TOY MOVIES G.I. JOE, DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS, AND MICRONAUTS STORM INTO 2020 AND 2021(Photo by Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Pictures)In the weeks leading up to the end of each year, most of the studios typically send out promotional materials for the incoming year, and sometimes we learn of new release dates for projects further out. There may be more yet to come (since we’re only 5 days into 2018), but thus far, the studio with the biggest announcements has been Paramount Pictures, which is looking to recover from a weak 2017 in which it came in at #7 in box office share. Paramount has announced dates for four movies in partnership with the Hasbro toy company: G.I. Joe (3/27/20), Micronauts (10/16/20), Dungeons &amp; Dragons (7/23/21, recently acquired from Warner Bros), and an untitled Hasbro film (10/1/21). G.I. Joe is expected to be a fresh new reboot (possibly more directly based on the 1980s toy line), and is claiming the weekend before an untitled DC Comics movie and one of Disney’s live-action fairy tales (both on 4/3/20). Last week, Paramount also revealed our first glimpse of the 1980s-set Bumblebee prequel (12/21/18), showing the Transformer in his original VW “bug” form.7. DWAYNE JOHNSON CONFIRMS JOURNEY 3 NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT(Photo by Ron Phillips/Warner Bros.)Dwayne Johnson’s reboot Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;has proven itself at the box office since it opened. Add in&nbsp;Disney’s Jungle Cruise and the partially jungle-set video game adaptation Rampage, and Dwayne Johnson has clearly established himself as something of a king of the “jungle movie.” This all sort of started with 2003’s The Rundown&nbsp;and the sequel Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. These other successes seem to have been bad news for fans hoping for Journey 3, however, as Johnson confirmed this week that Journey 3 is no longer in development. Answering a fan’s question on Twitter, Johnson replied, “Unfortunately, I have no plans to make another Journey movie. My goal to make Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon&nbsp;became a real challenge to crack creatively.” We’re calling this a Fresh Development because of the Rotten 43% Tomatometer score for Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK?2.&nbsp;WILL FUTURE DC COMICS MOVIES BE SPOOKY&nbsp;LIKE&nbsp;THE CONJURING?(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although Warner Bros.’ DC Comics films like Suicide Squad and Justice League did well at the box office, the perception is still out there that these films could have been better (26% and 40% on the Tomatometer, respectively). Ostensibly, the hope is that better films will also do even better box office (like the Certified Fresh&nbsp;Wonder Woman did with a 92%). With that in mind, Warner Bros. is shaking up the corporate leadership of its DC Films division,&nbsp;and the new boss is one Walter Hamada, who&nbsp;comes to DC from WB’s New Line Cinema subsidiary, where he was in charge of horror hits like IT and The Conjuring cinematic universe (Annabelle, etc). This has quickly led to speculation that some of the DC Comics projects that will receive greenlights will be on the spookier, “scary” side. That’s great for comics adaptations that make sense as horror films, but what about traditional superhero movies? Are they in trouble at Warner Bros.?1. NETFLIX COMMITS TO SEQUEL FOR ORC COP DRAMA BRIGHT(Photo by Netflix)Although at least one source has proclaimed Bright to be the “worst movie of 2017,” Netflix appears to be quite content with the results (Rotten at 28% on the Tomatometer). Will Smith starred in the gritty fantasy/action movie as a cop living and working in a modern world where orcs, elves, and dragons coexist alongside humans. Netflix is moving forward with a Bright sequel to be written and directed by David Ayer (Suicide Squad, Training Day), with the first film’s screenwriter Max Landis (Chronicle) not returning. Despite the horrible reviews, Bright is estimated to have been watched by 11 million people its first weekend, which, if they had been box office tickets, may have been worth as much as a $98 million opening.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Series, Originals, e., Spike, Calendar, films, canceled, drama, Day, BBC, Infographic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/05192438/Merlin-Ridley-Scott-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"ridley-scott-in-talks-to-direct-disneys-merlin-saga-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509184507215","title":"Jon Favreau Will Write a Live-Action Star Wars Series on Disney’s Streaming Service, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jon Favreau Will Write a Live-Action Star Wars Series on Disney's Streaming Service, and More Movie NewsThe Sopranos gets a prequel, Netflix bets on Keanu, Elizabeth Banks and James Gunn reunite, and remakes for Logan's Run and The Crow move forward.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 9, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;titles such as The Joker, the Sopranos prequel, and remakes of The Crow and Logan’s Run.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJON FAVREAU TAPPED TO RUN LIVE-ACTION&nbsp;STAR WARS SERIES FOR DISNEY’S STREAMING SERVICE(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Last August, Disney announced plans to launch their own streaming app in 2019 that would feature both their existing catalog and new, original programming (including from their subsidiaries like Marvel). Since then, we’ve heard that this streaming service will be the new destination of formerly theatrical projects like the&nbsp;live-action remakes&nbsp;of Lady and the Tramp and The Sword in the Stone, and that Netflix will no longer be debuting any new Marvel shows. Now, we have confirmation that the not-yet-named Disney streaming service will be getting a live-action Star Wars series, and&nbsp;Jon Favreau, whose filmography as director includes Iron Man, The Jungle Book, and next year’s The Lion King, will executive produce and write it. That’s about all we know right now, but just Favreau’s name alone has already inspired plenty of online reactions. The other&nbsp;big Star Wars news this week was composer John Williams’ announcement that next year’s not-yet-titled Star Wars Episode IX (12/20/19) will be his last as composer. (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was scored by Michael Giacchino, and frequent animation composer John Powell worked on Solo: A Star Wars Story.)Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;THE SOPRANOS IS&nbsp;GETTING A PREQUEL MOVIERyan FujitaniThere may never be a firm definition of exactly when today’s “New Golden Age of Television” began, but several of the early groundbreaking shows that arguably paved the way were on HBO in the early 2000s. In addition to The Wire, Deadwood, Six Feet Under, and Curb Your Enthusiasm, HBO’s most applauded series during that time was the suburban crime drama&nbsp;The Sopranos&nbsp;(1999-2007). There had been rumors at the time about a possible Sopranos movie (here’s the late James Gandolfini being asked about it by TMZ), but over ten years later, it seemed unlikely. David Chase has now, however, sold a screenplay to New Line Cinema called The Many Saints of Newark, which is being described as a prequel feature film for The Sopranos. The title refers to the 1967 Newark riots, as the film will focus on&nbsp;“a time when the African-Americans and the Italians of Newark were at each other’s throats, and amongst the gangsters of each group, those conflicts became especially lethal.” Since 1967 was some 30+ years before The Sopranos started, any characters from the show will have to be recast by (much) younger actors&nbsp;(Tony Soprano would have been&nbsp;about 5 or 6 at the time).2. NETFLIX BETTING BIG ON SUPERHEROES WITH KEANU REEVES AND EXTREME COMICS(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)As noted in the Top Story above, Netflix won’t be getting the rights to any additional Marvel shows (other than the ones they already have, like this week’s Jessica Jones S2). On the other hand, those Marvel shows have been very lucrative successes for Netflix, so unsurprisingly, Netflix is looking for new superhero sources. This week, the streaming giant inked a deal with Deadpool creator Rob Liefeld for a series of connected movies that will be based on his Extreme Comics characters. They’re not as famous as Deadpool or Cable, but Liefeld’s Extreme Studios characters and titles include Bloodstrike, Bloodwulf, Re-Gex, and Kaboom. Netflix is also now teaming up with Anthony and Joe Russo, the directors of Marvel’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, and Avengers: Infinity War, for a project they’re producing called Past Midnight. No deal has been finalized yet, but the Russos hope to convince Keanu Reeves to star in Past Midnight, which is mysteriously described as “a new type of vigilante superhero story.” Past Midnight will be directed by Rick Famuyiwa (Dope), who was previously working on The Flash for Warner Bros.3. BABY DRIVER STAR LILY JAMES TO STAR IN&nbsp;DANNY BOYLE’S NEW MUSICAL(Photo by Sony Pictures)&nbsp;Director Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver was hailed by some writers —&nbsp;sometimes literally&nbsp;—&nbsp;as a new kind of musical, and now&nbsp;Wright’s female lead in that film, Lily James, has already signed on for another (untitled) musical. Danny Boyle obviously used music heavily in his two Trainspotting movies, but the closest he’s gotten to directing a musical so far was 2008’s Slumdog Millionaire, which ended in a big Bollywood-style dance routine. The premise of Boyle’s untitled musical isn’t yet known, except that it’s set in the 1960s or 1970s, and that James will be playing a teacher. Between Baby Driver and this musical, Lily James will also play the young Meryl Streep in this summer’s sequel Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (7/20/18).4. SLITHER STAR ELIZABETH BANKS RETURNING TO HORROR(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;A lot of major movie stars made early appearances in horror movies, including Johnny Depp (A Nightmare on Elm Street), Jennifer Lawrence (House at the End of the Street), and Charlize Theron (Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest). Before Pitch Perfect, and before she played Rita Repulsa in Power Rangers, Elizabeth Banks starred in 2006’s Slither, directed by James Gunn (way, way before Guardians of the Galaxy). Banks will reunite with Gunn (as producer) for a new horror movie to be directed by David Yarovesky (The Hive), though the premise and title of the project are not yet known. Banks also recently wrapped The Happytime Murders, co-starring Melissa McCarthy, which sort of does for Muppet-type characters what Who Framed Roger Rabbit did for cartoons.5. THE JOKER ORIGIN STORY RESEMBLES A CERTAIN MARTIN SCORSESE MOVIE(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)When the news first broke last summer that Martin Scorsese (Casino, Goodfellas) was producing a Joker origin story movie for Warner Bros and DC Comics, the easy guess would’ve been that the connection was through organized crime. This week, however, a very simple premise (less than a sentence) was revealed, and it all makes sense. In this iteration, which will be directed by&nbsp;Todd Phillips&nbsp;(The Hangover,&nbsp;War Dogs),&nbsp;The Joker&nbsp;will be “a failed 1980s comedian who becomes the clown prince of crime after bombing with audiences,” which is (somewhat) similar to the premise of Scorsese’s 1982 film&nbsp;The King of Comedy, in which Robert De Niro’s failed comedian kidnaps a famous talk show host played by Jerry Lewis. This logline also connects the story to Alan Moore’s popular graphic novel&nbsp;Batman: The Killing Joke, in which the Joker also gets his start as a flailing stand-up comedian. Joaquin Phoenix remains attached to star in this Joker origin story, but there’s no release date yet.ROTTEN IDEAs OF THE WEEK4. THIS WEEK IN REMAKES PART I: LOGAN’S RUN TO GET HUNGER GAMES-STYLE REBOOTIf you ever read some of these film development stories and think, “Isn’t that a little bit too on the nose?,” it’s possible you don’t think like a studio executive. Warner Bros’ reaction to the rise of the “dystopian young adult novel” (The Hunger Games, Divergence, Maze Runner) over the last several years has apparently been to develop a reboot of a movie that did all that stuff back in the 1970s. 1976’s Logan’s Run was set in a future where all of society’s problems&nbsp;are seemingly solved by executing every person as soon as they turn 30 years old. As this piece puts it, the premise of the film is basically, ““Hey, I think I might want to do things after I turn 30 rather than engage in ritual suicide.” The idea of a Logan’s Run reboot has been kicking around for several years (including a time when it would have been directed by Bryan Singer), but it’s back again. To that end, Warner Bros has hired screenwriter Peter Craig, who co-wrote the two halves of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, to tackle the project. For obvious reasons.3. THIS WEEK IN REMAKES PART II: THE 1996 MARK WAHLBERG THRILLER FEAR(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)Hollywood may&nbsp;one day run out of viable 1980s movies to remake, but the 1990s&nbsp;are just as ripe with potential&nbsp;(IT was, for example, a 1990s remake). Nostalgia for the latter decade may also be prime for mining as the “millennial” generation reaches its 30s and starts to get misty-eyed for the years when Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon weren’t&nbsp;the big stars they are now. In 1996, a pre-Pleasantville Witherspoon starred alongside then-rapper and sporadic underwear model Wahlberg in the thriller&nbsp;Fear&nbsp;(Rotten at 39%). Universal is now developing a remake of&nbsp;that film,&nbsp;which “will be told from a female perspective” — sort of a weird thing to note,&nbsp;considering&nbsp;the original film was also told from a female perspective.2. THIS WEEK IN REMAKES PART III: JASON MOMOA’S THE CROW REBOOT SCHEDULED FOR 2019(Photo by Lionsgate Entertainment)When the indie comic book adaptation The Crow&nbsp;came out in 1994, it was the epitome of 1990s goth/industrial cool, and it arguably inspired much of the rest of what superhero movies would look like in the 1990s (Blade, Spawn, etc). We’ve been hearing since 2008 about plans for a reboot of The Crow, but no movie has come out of it, even as a series of potential stars — like&nbsp;James McAvoy, Luke Evans, and Nicholas Hoult — have come and gone. In 2016, reboot chatter sprung up again when&nbsp;Jason Momoa (Aquaman) announced his involvement, and now Sony Pictures has finally announced a release date. The Crow is now scheduled for October 11, 2019, which puts it directly up against two other similarly spooky adaptations: the animated reboot of The Addams Family, and the spooky Nickelodeon series adaptation Are You Afraid of the Dark?1. TIFFANY HADDISH TO FOLLOW TYLER PERRY’S THE LIST(Photo by Michele K. Short/Universal Pictures)There’s no denying that Tyler Perry has established himself as a reliable perennial box office sensation, but he’s also built up his movie franchise despite almost always earning Rotten Tomatometer scores. As a result, we report news about Tyler Perry as “Rotten Ideas” even when they involve people who might otherwise earn “Fresh” scores for other projects. Comic actress Tiffany Haddish, for example, is coming off her big comedy hit last summer,&nbsp;Girls Trip (Certified Fresh at 90%) — and a funny bit with Maya Rudolph at Sunday’s&nbsp;Academy Awards. Unfortunately, Tyler Perry’s Rotten streak might just be &gt; Tiffany Haddish, who has signed to star in Tyler Perry’s The List, a “catfishing” romantic comedy to be released on November 2, 2018. Perry and Haddish have some pretty strong competition on that date, as they’re currently up against X-Men: Dark Phoenix, Disney’s live action adaptation of The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, and the historical epic Mary Queen of Scots (starring Margot Robbie and Saoirse Ronan).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Network, historical, kong, Signature, adaptation, television, Heroines, kaiju","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/09160311/Jon-Favreau-Disney-Star-Wars-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"jon-favreau-will-write-a-live-action-star-wars-series-on-disneys-streaming-service-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509184515411","title":"Game of Thrones Producers Get Their Own Star Wars Movies, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Game of Thrones Producers Get Their Own Star Wars Movies, and More NewsRichard Linklater is filming a 1960s period drama, Matt Smith tackles Charles Manson, Christian Bale and Matt Damon join a racing drama, and Joaquin Phoenix will be the next Joker.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 9, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering&nbsp;titles such as The Joker&nbsp;and DC Comics’&nbsp;Lobo&nbsp;(and this column also marks this writer’s 10th anniversary writing the Weekly Ketchup.&nbsp;Yay.)This WEEK’S TOP STORYGAME OF THRONES PRODUCERS SIGN ON FOR&nbsp;A SERIES OF&nbsp;STAR WARS MOVIES(Photo by Steve Granitz/Getty Images)As recently as this past November, we learned that Star Wars: The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson had started development on a new trilogy of Star Wars movies (separate from the third “Skywalker trilogy” we’re currently one movie away from finishing), so this week’s news understandably took some fans by surprise. That’s because we now know of a new&nbsp;series of Star Wars movies, which will be written and produced by the team of David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, best known for shepherding and adapting HBO’s Game of Thrones&nbsp;from George R.R. Martin’s popular A Song of Ice and Fire novels. Benioiff and Weiss will remain&nbsp;quite busy for the next year or two, as Game of Thrones&nbsp;ends its eight season run in 2019, so we probably&nbsp;won’t hear a whole lot about their&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;series until&nbsp;sometime after that (or even later). At this point, all we know for sure is that their movies will be separate from Rian Johnson’s Star Wars trilogy and likely be very different. We also don’t know for sure how these new films will impact the&nbsp;Star Wars Story spinoffs (of which this May’s&nbsp;Solo: A Star Wars Story is the second). [UPDATE:&nbsp;Edited to clarify that the new movies are not necessarily a trilogy.]Fresh Developments1. WATCH OUT TARANTINO: RICHARD LINKLATER ALSO HAS A MYSTERY SUMMER OF 1969 PROJECT(Photo by Wilson Webb/Lionsgate)We’ve known since last summer that Quentin Tarantino is preparing an untitled drama set in Hollywood during the summer of 1969 with a real-life historical event as its background (namely the Manson Family murders). Tarantino is evidently not, however, the only Academy Award-nominated director with the summer of ’69 on his mind.&nbsp;Having wrapped&nbsp;Where’d You Go Bernadette&nbsp;(starring Cate Blanchett),&nbsp;Richard Linklater (Boyhood, School of Rock) is also filming a movie set during that period in Houston, albeit set against the backdrop of a historical event&nbsp;that&nbsp;is a lot more optimistic about the nature of humanity. The new film&nbsp;is “told from a child’s point of view and revolves, in some way, around the moon landing.” Linklater is also putting together a soundtrack made up of “regional hits from the time.”&nbsp;In the same way that Tarantino’s film is scheduled for the 50th anniversary of Sharon Tate’s murder (8/9/19), Linklater is hoping to get his film in theaters around the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969.2. DOCTOR WHO #11 MATT SMITH CAST AS AMERICAN PSYCHO CHARLES MANSON(Photo by BBC)American Psycho came out over 17 years ago, but its director, Mary Harron, has only been able to get two films greenlit since then&nbsp;(further illustrating the continuing difficulties&nbsp;female directors face in Hollywood today). Harron has finally been able to get her 5th film as director greenlit by returning to a premise similar to American Psycho,&nbsp;namely by making a film involving a real American psycho. British actor Matt Smith (AKA the 11th Doctor on Doctor Who) has been cast in a historical drama called Charlie Says as Charles Manson, the recently deceased criminal mastermind and cult leader responsible for directing his followers to murder seven people during the late 1960s. Charlie Says will tell the true story of three of Manson’s followers (Leslie Van Houten, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel), with an emphasis on their trial in 1971 for the Tate murders. Separately from Charlie Says and Tarantino’s aforementioned film, Hilary Duff is also attached to star as Sharon Tate in The Haunting of Sharon Tate, which Tate’s sister is already calling “classless” and a “total fabrication.”3. CHRISTIAN BALE AND MATT DAMON MAY COSTAR IN FORD/FERRARI CAR BUSINESS DRAMA(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/Broad Green Pictures, Paramount Pictures)Last month, 20th Century Fox shut down development of the biopic American Heiress after its subject, Patricia “Patty” Hearst protested the project (and an upcoming CNN documentary). American Heiress had actually been on something of a fast track (possibly because of how much Hearst’s true story resembles Fox’s recent hit All the Money in the World), so its shelving left director James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma) with a huge gap in his schedule. As such, Mangold has now signed on for another true story at Fox, which is the long-in-development untitled film about the race between the automobile companies Ford and Ferrari to design the world’s fastest car in the 1960s. Fox’s top picks for the film’s two real-life lead characters are Matt Damon and Christian Bale, who would play automobile designer Carroll Shelby and British racer Ken Miles, respectively. Shelby and Miles were assigned by Henry Ford II to build a new car “to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari at the&nbsp;1966 Le Mans World Championship.”4. THIS WEEK IN DWAYNE JOHNSON: JUMANJI 3, RED NOTICE, AND HIS FAST &amp; FURIOUS SPINOFF(Photo by Frank Masi/Columbia Pictures)Even as Hollywood’s output seems to be&nbsp;increasingly dominated by franchises, there are still a few movie stars who seem to be able to (almost always) singlehandedly deliver box office success. One such star is Dwayne Johnson, whose latest film,&nbsp;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,has earned over $350 million (and counting), and whose Skyscraper (7/13/18) became a popular meme this week. As such, Johnson continues to make big new deals, and his films are moving through development quickly. First up, there’s Jumanji 3, for which stars Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan are all signed to reprise their roles,&nbsp;and which now boasts the screenwriters of this October’s Venom&nbsp;(in the same week the Venom-free trailer for Venom debuted). Director David Leitch (Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde) also signed this week to direct the Fast &amp; Furious spinoff featuring the characters played by Johnson and Jason Statham. Finally, after a “heated” bidding war, Universal Pictures has acquired the rights to Red Notice, a “globe-trotting heist thriller” action-comedy in which Dwayne Johnson will reunite with his Central Intelligence and Skyscraper director Rawson Thurber.5. DISNEY’S STREAMING APP WILL FEATURE LIVE ACTION LADY AND THE TRAMP, DON QUIXOTE, AND SWORD IN THE STONEWe’ve heard recent news from Walt Disney Pictures about both The Merlin Saga from director Ridley Scott and a live-action remake of their classic animated film The Sword in the Stone, which prompted speculation that the two films might be connected. An article this week about Disney’s new streaming service (which will launch in late 2019) revealed some of the live-action feature films that&nbsp;will debut exclusively on the app, and it possibly clarifies that issue. Disney’s plan is for the new app to have 4-5 original movies each year (and 5 new TV series, including spinoffs from both Star Wars and Marvel). Some of the “priority” feature films are live-action remakes of Lady and the Tramp and the aforementioned Sword and the Stone, as well as remakes of Three Men and a Baby and Don Quixote. The Disney app will also be the destination of the movies Magic Camp and Noelle (starring Anna Kendrick), which had previously been expected to be theatrically released in 2018 or 2019.6. RAPPER GUCCI MANE TO RECEIVE BIOPIC FROM 8 MILE/EMPIRE PRODUCERS(Photo by Steven Ferdman/Everett Collection)Gucci Mane,&nbsp;a rapper from Alabama and Atlanta credited with pioneering a subgenre of hip hop called “trap music,” recently told his own life story in his book, The Autobiography of Gucci Mane. Accordingly, there are now plans for Gucci Mane’s life story to be adapted as feature film produced by Paramount Players and Imagine Entertainment. Among other credits, Imagine Entertainment is the company behind Eminem’s 8 Mile and rap industry TV drama Empire. The film is expected to tell the story of Gucci Mane’s “childhood in poverty in Alabama and his move to Atlanta, where he became involved in criminal activity. He spent nearly three years in prison starting in 2004 after pleading guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. While incarcerated, he began releasing mixtapes from prison with rappers Migos and Young Thug.”ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. JOAQUIN PHOENIX IN TALKS TO BE FIFTH LIVE-ACTION JOKER(Photo by Warner Bros.)As Batman’s most well known arch-enemy,&nbsp;the Joker has been portrayed in live-action movies by four different actors to date (Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and Jared Leto). There has been talk that Leto might reprise his Suicide Squad depiction in either a sequel to that film or a spinoff alongside Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn. Amidst all that, there was also the revelation last year that director Todd Phillips (The Hangover) was developing a solo movie for The Joker (which Martin Scorsese was reportedly also producing). Scorsese’s name wasn’t in this week’s news, but another frequent awards honoree, Joaquin Phoenix, is now reportedly in talks with Warner Bros. to star in Phillips’ untitled movie about the Joker’s origin story. Leto, meanwhile, remains attached to play The Joker in at least one future movie. The four films Todd Phillips has directed since 2009’s The Hangover have all received Rotten Tomatometer scores.2.&nbsp;TRANSFORMERS MASTERMIND MICHAEL BAY MAY DIRECT DC COMICS’ COSMIC BAD BOY LOBO(Photo by Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount)Marvel Comics&nbsp;has its own share of popular comic book “bad boys”: we’re thinking of Deadpool, Venom, Wolverine, and even The Punisher (though he’s less “fun”).&nbsp;Similarly, DC Comics&nbsp;has&nbsp;Lobo, a cosmic bounty hunter and mercenary whose look is something&nbsp;akin to a biker by way of the Insane Clown Posse. “Subtle” has never been in Lobo‘s vocabulary, so perhaps this week’s news about his potential director was always somewhat&nbsp;inevitable. Director/producer Michael Bay (Armageddon, Transformers) is now in talks with Warner Bros. to direct their long-in-development Lobo movie. The current Lobo screenplay reportedly would require a budget of over $200 million, so trimming the film’s scale is something both Bay and Warner Bros. agreed to resolve before he would sign on. Bay has directed and produced dozens of films, but none that he’s directed has been Fresh since 1996’s The Rock.1. THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX JUST MIGHT INVOLVE ITS ROTTEN TOMATOMETER SCORES(Photo by Netflix)The film we now know as The Cloverfield Paradox (it was previously titled&nbsp;God Particle)&nbsp;had originally been scheduled for a theatrical release until recently, when Paramount Pictures sold the film to Netflix instead. This past Super Bowl Sunday set some crazy precedents and/or records, as the following all happened on one day: Netflix revealed the new title of the film, its first trailer, its release date (which was the same day, after the big game), and then The Cloverfield Paradox debuted on the streaming service that same night. The Cloverfield Paradox trailer appeared to promise lots of Cloverfield answers, but critics were unimpressed, and the score currently sits at a very Rotten 17%. We don’t know for sure what sort of metrics Netflix uses for these events, but they reportedly paid Paramount $50 million for the rights to the film. Meanwhile, Paramount is reportedly sticking to their plans for a 4th Cloverfield film (AKA Overlord), about zombies during World War II, to be released this fall on October 26th, 2018. Also in possibly related news, Netflix has acquired the rights to the Universal Pictures science fiction film Extinction, starring Lizzy Caplan (who, as it happens, co-starred in the first&nbsp;Cloverfield).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"golden, CBS, ViacomCBS, the, GoT, Emmy, Summer, politics, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/09205618/Benioff-Weiss-Star-Wars-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"game-of-thrones-producers-get-their-own-star-wars-movies-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509185880422","title":"Kristen Stewart and Lupita Nyong’o Wanted for Charlie’s Angels Reboot, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kristen Stewart and Lupita Nyong'o Wanted for Charlie's Angels Reboot, and More Movie NewsDiCaprio and Scorsese reunite for a Teddy Roosevelt biopic, Michelle Williams joins Venom, Denis Villeneuve takes on Cleopatra, and Kumail Nanjiani will be John Cena's cop buddy.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 29, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Charlie’s Angels, Coming to America 2, Men in Black 4, and the biopics Cleopatra and Roosevelt. &nbsp;&nbsp;This WEEK’S TOP STORYKRISTEN STEWART AND LUPITA NYONG’O WANTED FOR CHARLIE’S ANGELS REBOOT(Photo by Jon Kopaloff, Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images)Nothing is set in stone yet, but we’re starting to get an idea of what the Charlie’s Angels reboot (6/7/2019) will look like. The TV show ran on ABC from 1976 to 1981, and was followed by two movies in 2000 and 2003 headlined by Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu. Elizabeth Banks’ first film as a director was Pitch Perfect 2, and this reboot will be her second.&nbsp;Two stars Sony Pictures reportedly hopes will sign on are Kristen Stewart&nbsp;and Lupita Nyong’o. Aside from&nbsp;Snow White and the Huntsman, Stewart has mostly focused on smaller movies since Twilight, while Nyong’o is still best known for her breakout role in 12 Years a Slave&nbsp;and voice work in The Jungle Book and&nbsp;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&nbsp;(and an upcoming Internet-inspired Netflix movie with Rihanna). There’s no word yet about who the third Angel might be, or who might be cast as their male sidekick, Bosley.Fresh Developments1. BULLY FOR LEONARDO DICAPRIO – HE’S GOING TO PLAY TEDDY ROOSEVELT(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Although Leonardo DiCaprio and director Martin Scorsese seem inexorably connected at the hip, it’s actually been four years since their last film together, 2013’s The Wolf of Wall Street. We don’t know for sure yet what their sixth film together will be, but possibilities have included adaptations of the true crime books The Devil in the White City and Killers of the Flower Moon, and recent rumors about the Joker supervillain prequel. As it sometimes happens, the actual answer might be “none of the above,” as the duo has set up a biopic of the 26th POTUS, Theordore “Teddy” Roosevelt, at Paramount for both of them to produce. Roosevelt is likely to cover multiple stages of Roosevelt’s career, including terms as the NYC Police Commissioner, New York’s governor, the leader of the Rough Riders during the Spanish-American War, the youngest President (to date), the founder of the National Parks system, and a key early leader in the Progressive movement.2.&nbsp;BLADE RUNNER 2049 DIRECTOR TO TAKE US BACK IN TIME WITH CLEOPATRA BIOPIC(Photo by Jan Thijs/Paramount Pictures)Director Denis Villeneuve already boasts one of the most impressively consistent Certified Fresh filmographies of any director currently working, and the early buzz&nbsp;and first reviews for next week’s Blade Runner 2049&nbsp;indicate more of the same.&nbsp;Next up, Villeneuve&nbsp;appears to be set to take on an ambitious long-in-development biopic, as the French Canadian director is in discussions with Sony Pictures to tackle their adaptation of Cleopatra (based on the book by Stacy Schiff), about the famous&nbsp;Egyptian ruler. Angelina Jolie was at one time attached to star in Cleopatra, but it’s unclear if that’s still the case. Elizabeth Taylor starred in 1963’s&nbsp;Cleopatra, at one time considered one of the most expensive box office flops ever. Denis Villeneuve is also developing a remake&nbsp;of Frank Herbert’s Dune, which he’s expected to direct before Cleopatra is ready to shoot.3.&nbsp;MANCHESTER BY THE SEA&nbsp;STAR MICHELLE WILLIAMS JOINS MARVEL ADAPTATION&nbsp;VENOM(Photo by Michael Gibson/Magnolia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Ruben Fleischer‘s career Tomatometer is not great, despite an auspicious debut with 2009’s Certified Fresh Zombieland. We get that.&nbsp;But it just so happens that he’s working on two of this week’s biggest stories, and Fleischer’s Tomatometer aside, they’re both pretty interesting. One of them is Sony’s&nbsp;Venom&nbsp;(10/5/18), starring Tom Hardy (Mad Max: Fury Road) as Marvel’s slimy, oozy antihero. Four-time Academy Award nominee&nbsp;Michelle Williams&nbsp;(Brokeback Mountain,&nbsp;Blue Valentine,&nbsp;My Week with Marilyn,&nbsp;Manchester by the Sea)&nbsp;is in talks to co-star&nbsp;in&nbsp;Venom&nbsp;as a district attorney and potential love interest for Hardy’s Eddie Brock.&nbsp;It’s a little bit outside the indie wheelhouse where Williams has carved out a fantastic career, but if she and Hardy bring their A-game to bear on&nbsp;Venom, it could turn out to be something really special.4. NATALIE PORTMAN’S DAZZLING NEW TRAILER DEBUTS FOR SCI-FI DRAMA ANNIHILATION(Photo by Paramount Pictures)It’s one thing to hear about a fantasy or science fiction film abstractly through news articles, and a completely different thing to see the dazzling eye candy&nbsp;months or years later. Such was arguably the case for the upcoming adaptation (2/23/18) of Jeff VanderMeer’s 2014 novel Annihilation. The movie stars Natalie Portman, Oscar Isaac, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, and it was directed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina, Certified Fresh at 92%). As you can see in the trailer, Annihilation is about a team of experts who venture into a mysterious “Area X” and&nbsp;encounter lifeforms that defy description or explanation.5. JOHN CENA AND KUMAIL NANJIANI TO STAR IN BUDDY COP COMEDY(Photo by Nicole Rivelli/Lionsgate, Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)The second story involving&nbsp;Ruben Fleischer this week is vastly different than the first. Aside from Venom, Fleischer is also&nbsp;set to produce and direct a buddy cop comedy pairing wrestler-turned-actor John Cena and&nbsp;Silicon Valley&nbsp;star Kumail Nanjiani, whose autobiographical romantic comedy The Big Sick was the best-reviewed film of this summer. To reiterate, Fleischer’s spotty Tomatometer record is worth some consideration, but this idea admittedly&nbsp;has potential, and Cena has proven he’s got comedy chops enough to hang with the likes of Nanjiani. Here’s hoping this movie falls closer to Beverly Hills Cop or Lethal Weapon than, say, 2010’s&nbsp;Cop Out,&nbsp;which&nbsp;also seemed like a decent enough idea at the time.6.&nbsp;BLACK-ISH CREATOR WORKING ON SEQUEL TO 1998’S COMING TO AMERICA(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)There is the argument to be made that when too much time passes, sequels reach their expiration date, but every once in a while, the decades of separation absolutely works to the sequel’s advantage (like, say, T2: Trainspotting&nbsp;or Richard Linklater’s upcoming Last Flag Flying). The Eddie Murphy comedy Coming to America (in which he plays an African prince) celebrates its 30th anniversary next year, and it just so happens that it’s now getting a surprise sequel, which will&nbsp;be written by Black-ish creator Kenya Barris and directed by Jonathan Levine (Warm Bodies, 50/50). The Coming to America 2 premise isn’t yet known, but a good guess might involve a new prince — maybe the son of Murphy’s Akeem?7. FOURTH MEN IN BLACK MOVIE TO INVADE THE SUMMER OF 2019(Photo by Columbia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Nearly three years ago, we first heard about Sony’s plans to use the third 21 Jump Street movie (starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum) as a crossover relaunch for their Men in Black franchise as well. That still has yet to happen, and both Tatum&nbsp;and Hill have since&nbsp;moved on to other projects. The crossover might still happen someday, but in the meantime, Sony announced that&nbsp;the fourth Men in Black movie will be a different spinoff. The new script from screenwriters Matt Holloway and Art Marcum (co-writers of Iron Man, Transformers: The Last Knight) will see the secret&nbsp;police force protecting Earth from alien intruders with a completely new cast of characters. The film&nbsp;is currently scheduled for May 17, 2019 (against John Wick: Chapter 3, and a week before Aladdin and Minecraft).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2.&nbsp;TERMINATOR 6 TO BE DIRECT SEQUEL TO TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY(Photo by TriStar Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Director James Cameron started filming his four Avatar sequels this week (on a combined budget of over $1 billion), aiming for December release dates in 2020, 2021, 2024, and 2025, and showing off images of the franchise’s new kid/teen cast. Cameron also spent the&nbsp;week talking up Terminator 6 (which he is producing), announcing its release date of July 26, 2019 (in between The Lion King and The Spongebob Movie 3). He&nbsp;also confirmed that Terminator 6 will ignore the events of the three movies&nbsp;after Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Other updates address the aging of the T-800 played by Arnold Schwarzenegger (now 70 years old),&nbsp;his warnings that Skynet has already happened, and more shade thrown at&nbsp;Wonder Woman. We’re calling the news of the third Terminator reboot Rotten because the other two were (26% and 33% respectively).1. THE LIVE ACTION CLIFFORD THE BIG RED DOG‘S DIRECTOR AND HIS ROTTEN TOMATOMETER(Photo by Touchstone Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Universal Pictures was trying to get a live action/CGI hybrid adaptation of the popular children’s book (and PBS TV series) character Clifford the Big Red Dog going for many years (including a period in which he was used in their promotional materials). In 2016, however, after Universal’s plans to release the film in 2016 failed to work out, Clifford the Big Red Dog galloped his way over to Paramount Pictures. A year later, we now know who Paramount has hired to direct Clifford the Big Red Dog, and it’s Walt Becker. Becker’s Tomatometer is remarkably Rotten, with none of his five feature films earning a score above 16% on the Tomatometer (Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip), and one of them scoring as low as 5% (2009’s Old Dogs).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"razzies, Now, Rocketman, Reality, the, archives, independent","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/29171621/KStew-Nyongo-Charlies-Angels-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"kristen-stewart-and-lupita-nyongo-wanted-for-charlies-angels-reboot-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509185871201","title":"Chuck Star Zachary Levi Is DC’s Shazam!, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Chuck Star Zachary Levi Is DC's Shazam!, and More Movie NewsBeyonce is The Lion King's Nala, Tarantino wants Pitt and DiCaprio for his Manson movie, Julianne Moore will portray Gloria Steinem, and producer Kathleen Kennedy spoils Star Wars.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 3, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as The Lion King, Shazam!, Star Wars Episode IX, and Quentin Tarantino’s next film.This WEEK’S TOP STORYCHUCK STAR ZACHARY LEVI IS DC’S SHAZAM!(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection. Courtesy of DC Entertainment)Fans have known since this summer’s San Diego Comic-Con that the DC Comics movie to start filming after Aquaman (12/21/18) would be Shazam!&nbsp;We thought for a time that Dwayne Johnson would appear in the film as anti-hero Black Adam, until DC’s Geoff Johns revealed that wasn’t the case, and we learned this week that comedy screenwriter&nbsp;Adam Sztykiel&nbsp;(Alvin &amp; The Chipmunks: The Road Chip,&nbsp;Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul) will be adapting that film. All that said, we still didn’t know who would&nbsp;star as&nbsp;Shazam (previously called Captain Marvel, which is a long story) himself, or any other co-star for that matter.&nbsp;Armie Hammer was Dwayne Johnson’s top pick, but as it turns out, the role now belongs to&nbsp;Zachary Levi, who remains best-known for starring as NBC’s Chuck from 2007 to 2012. Shazam! will be directed by David F. Sandberg (Lights Out, Annabelle: Creation), distributed by New Line Cinema probably sometime in 2019,&nbsp;and filming is scheduled to start in February. Mark Strong, who played Sinestro in 2011’s Green Lantern, will also play the Shazam! villain, Dr. Sivana,&nbsp;a sort of prototypical “mad scientist” type. We don’t know yet who will play Billy Batson, the boy that actually turns into Shazam.Fresh Developments1. BEYONCE CONFIRMED TO PLAY NALA IN DISNEY’S REMAKE OF THE LION KING(Photo by New Line Cinema)Back in late March, reports surfaced that Walt Disney Pictures was hoping to cast Beyonce as the voice of the lioness Nala in their upcoming remake of The Lion King (7/19/19), but those rumors were followed by months of silence. This week, Disney revealed the 14 main voice actors cast in The Lion King, and Beyonce will indeed play Nala, joining previously cast actors Donald Glover (Simba), Chiwetel Ejiofor (Scar), Alfre Woodard (Sarabi), Eric Andre (Azizi), Keegan-Michael Key (Kamari), John Oliver (Zazu), Seth Rogen (Pumbaa), Billy Eichner (Timon), and James Earl Jones (reprising his role as Mufasa). The Lion King will be directed by Jon Favreau, who is coming off Disney’s mostly-CGI-animated remake of The Jungle Book, and it’s scheduled to open on&nbsp;July 19th, 2019, which will give fans and Hollywood insiders alike time to discuss a key issue: is a movie like The Lion King (featuring only a cast of photorealistic CGI animals) “animated” or “live action”?2. QUENTIN TARANTINO WANTS BRAD PITT AND LEONARDO DICAPRIO FOR MOVIE #9(Photo by Weinstein Company, Andrew Cooper/Weinstein Company)Following his departure from The Weinstein Company for obvious reasons, Quentin Tarantino is now in looking for a new studio home for his ninth film. Executives from Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros. were invited this week to Tarantino’s agents’ office to read his screenplay about “the tragedy and cultural phenomenon of [Charles] Manson, his followers and the famous victims of their cult violence.” (Tarantino currently does not appear to be considering offers from streaming sites like Amazon or Netflix.) Tarantino reportedly wrote the Sharon Tate role with Margot Robbie in mind, and three of the other lead roles were written for Inglourious Basterds star Brad Pitt, Django Unchained co-star Leonardo DiCaprio, and frequent collaborator Samuel L. Jackson. Of course, none of those stars are signed yet. In other Leonardo DiCaprio news, his Appian Way production company this week secured the movie rights to Grant, about 18th president Ulysses S. Grant.3. CREED 2 IS THE MAIN EVENT ON 2018 CALENDAR FOR MGM AND ANNAPURNA PICTURES(Photo by Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros.)Since emerging from bankruptcy in 2010, the former Hollywood studio giant MGM has produced and released its films in various ways (usually through partnerships with other studios). This week, a new agreement was unveiled in which MGM and fledgling mini-studio Annapurna Pictures will partner on a new theatrical distributor called Mirror. The news came, however, with a release date with&nbsp;one of MGM’s partnerships (with Warner Bros) “tacked on”: Sylvester Stallone’s fifth Rocky film as director, Creed II, starring Michael B. Jordan, will be released on November 21, 2018 (up against Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2, and Robert Zemeckis’ Marwencol remake, now called The Women of Marwen). MGM’s films under Mirror will be: the remakes of Death Wish (3/2/18) and&nbsp;Valley Girl (6/29/18), Fighting with My Family (9/14/18), the Nazi-hunting drama Operation Finale, the Dirty Rotten Scoundrels remake called Nasty Women, and the 25th James Bond. Annapurna’s 2018 contributions will include Richard Linklater’s Where’d You Go, Bernadette, Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk, and the untitled Dick Cheney biopic.4. JULIANNE MOORE TO PLAY FEMINIST GLORIA STEINEM IN MY LIFE ON THE ROAD(Photo by Universal Pictures)June Pictures is a fairly new independent film production company that even people paid to know such things&nbsp;aren’t all that familiar with yet. That’s starting to change, however, as one of their first films, The Florida Project, was a hit at Cannes and has real chances in this year’s upcoming awards season (it’s Certified Fresh at 95% on the Tomatometer). Willem Dafoe starred in The Florida Project, and for their upcoming film called My Life on the Road, June Pictures has landed another multiple Academy Award nominee. Julianne Moore will star as “iconic feminist activist” Gloria Steinem in My Life on the Road, which is also described as being a “coming of age” story, suggesting that another younger actress (or actresses) will also play Steinem at earlier stages of her life.5. MARGOT ROBBIE PRODUCING, AND MAY STAR AS, THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS(Photo by Frank Masi/Paramount Pictures)For every female-led box office success like&nbsp;Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect, there are equally underperforming films like last year’s Ghostbusters and, if estimates prove correct, this week’s&nbsp;A Bad Moms Christmas.&nbsp;With gender equality issues and sexual misconduct allegations&nbsp;swirling through contemporary Hollywood, there’s arguably a greater need now&nbsp;for quality&nbsp;entertainment&nbsp;produced, written by, directed by, and starring women. With that in mind,&nbsp;Universal Pictures has won a bidding war for the rights to the 1980 children’s book&nbsp;The Paper Bag Princess by author Robert Munsch, which was rewarded an endorsement by the National Organization for Women. Margot Robbie is producing and is expected to star, with Elizabeth Banks (Pitch Perfect 2, the upcoming Charlie’s Angels reboot) directing from a script by Katie Silberman.6. LUPITA NYONG’O AND JOSH GAD JOIN ZOMBIE COMEDY LITTLE MONSTERS(Photo by Dee Cercone, Jason Smith/Everett Collection)Between the two of them, Lupita Nyong’o&nbsp;and Josh Gad have appeared in Frozen, The Book of Mormon, entries in the Marvel (Black Panther) and Star Wars franchises, and two different Disney remakes of classic animated movies (Beauty and the Beast, The Jungle Book). What you won’t find in either of their Wikipedia pages, however,&nbsp;is any zombie movie whatsoever… yet. That’s right, the voices behind Olaf and Maz Kanata may soon be screaming as they run away from brain-eating wights, because Josh Gad and Lupita Nyong’o have joined the zombie comedy Little Monsters. The movie is already in production in Australia, with Nyong’o cast as a kindergarten teacher, and Gad as “kids show personality… Teddy McGiggle.”ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. LUCASFILM EXECUTIVE KATHLEEN KENNEDY SPOILS THE FUTURE OF STAR WARS(Photo by James Atoa/Everett Collection)[BEWARE: STAR WARS SPOILERS AHEAD]&nbsp;Obviously, this column is about the future of movies,&nbsp;so anything you read here could, in some ways, technically be considered a “spoiler.” And then, there are details — and honestly, these don’t happen as often as you’d think — that are just straight-up spoilers by definition. Star Wars Episode IX&nbsp; won’t be released until over two years from now (12/20/19), but thanks to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, we already know four huge reveals about that movie&nbsp;(and, for that matter, Star Wars: The Last Jedi). Really, this story has two parts. The first, which is totally not a spoiler to anyone paying attention, is that Lucasfilm is already working on “the next 10 years” of Star Wars. (Of course they are.) But here’s the especially&nbsp;spoilery&nbsp;part: “future stories beyond Episode IX with these new characters: Rey, Poe, Finn, BB-8.” By inference, that means those four characters will&nbsp;survive&nbsp;both of the next two “Episode” entries. Although critics love Star Wars, we’re calling this story a “Rotten Idea” because — did we mention? —&nbsp;SPOILERS.2.&nbsp;MEL GIBSON AND DANNY GLOVER ARE BOTH TOO OLD FOR THIS… LETHAL WEAPON 5(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of lots of things, like&nbsp;Dawson’s Creek, The Big Lebowski, and&nbsp;Metal Gear Solid, among others. 1998 was also the last time the Lethal Weapon franchise had a new feature film, Lethal Weapon 4, which saw franchise regulars Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, and Rene Russo joined by newcomers Jet Li and Chris Rock. Well, the Lethal Weapon TV series is apparently doing well enough that it hasn’t been canceled yet (two seasons in), which is apparently getting old school Lethal Weapon principals thinking about the good old days again. Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and director Richard Donner (Superman: The Movie) are reportedly now “huddling on the possibility of doing another film.” If Lethal Weapon 5 does move forward, the screenplay would reportedly be by Lethal Weapon 4 screenwriter Channing Gibson, whose last produced screenplay was the 2004 remake of Walking Tall starring Dwayne Johnson. Both Lethal Weapon 3 and Lethal Weapon 4 received Rotten Tomatometer scores.1. BRETT RATNER, THE HUGH HEFNER BIOPIC, RUSH HOUR 4, AND THE FUTURE OF WARNER BROS.(Photo by New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)On Wednesday, the news broke that six women had spoken out about “sexual harrassment or misconduct” by film director and producer Brett Ratner. You can read more about these continuing developments at Deadline, Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter. Ratner’s alleged misconduct has an arguably broader impact on the business side of Hollywood than did Harvey Weinstein. Ratner’s RatPac “essentially puts up 25% of all of” Warner Bros’ pictures (in what was supposed to be a 75 movie deal), and Ratner himself until this week had a prolific slate as both a producer and director (versus Weinstein, whose development slates have been slowing down for years). Warner Bros. is “scrubbing” the lot of Brett Ratner’s involvement, and projects like Rush Hour 4 and the Hugh Hefner biopic are either dead or, if they ever move forward, would do so without Brett Ratner. Even so, as Rotten as the impact of Ratner’s behavior is, hopefully people will continue to speak out.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Disney, and, 2015, Mary, camera, Sneak, children's, AMC, james, true, fresh, Mary, The","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/03181649/Zachary-Levi-Shazam-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"chuck-star-zachary-levi-is-dcs-shazam-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509185879397","title":"Gore Verbinski May Direct the Channing Tatum Gambit Movie, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Gore Verbinski May Direct the Channing Tatum Gambit Movie, and More NewsKate Winslet joins the Avatar sequels, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham plan a Fast and Furious spinoff, two big movies are postponed, and Rush Hour 4 may happen.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 6, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as&nbsp;Avatar 2, Bob’s Burgers, Fast &amp; Furious 9, Halloween, and the Bride of Frankenstein remake. &nbsp;&nbsp;This WEEK’S TOP STORYPIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN DIRECTOR IN TALKS FOR X-MEN SPINOFF GAMBIT(Photo by Anita Bugge, Samir Hussein/Getty Images)Two years ago at 2015’s San Diego Comic-Con, Channing Tatum was announced as starring in a solo spinoff movie for X-Men favorite Gambit (closing the deal a few weeks later). Gambit was initially scheduled for release on October 7, 2016 (that obviously didn’t happen), and two different directors came and went (Rupert Wyatt and Doug Liman). Channing Tatum, however, has remained steadfast through all of that, and now, his New Orleans superhero gambler Gambit might finally get a director with experience with a similar freewheelin’ adventurer, Jack Sparrow. Specifically, we’re talking about&nbsp;Gore Verbinski, who directed the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Rango, and The Ring.&nbsp;There is no (new) release date for Gambit yet, but Fox does have several “mystery” Marvel projects scheduled&nbsp;for 2019&nbsp;and 2020. The next three X-Men-related movies will be The New Mutants (4/13/18), Deadpool 2 (6/1/18), and X-Men: Dark Phoenix (11/2/18).Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;AVATAR SEQUELS TO BE TITANIC REUNION FOR KATE WINSLET(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although Titanic came out nearly 20 years ago, director James Cameron has only directed one non-documentary feature since: 2009’s Avatar (giving Cameron the #2 and #1 all-time box office positions), and&nbsp;star Kate Winslet has appeared in over 30 films. According to this week’s news, the two are set for a reunion (and then some), as Winslet is now signed to star in the Avatar franchise, beginning with Avatar 2. Winslet will be playing a character called “Ronal,” and it’s unclear how many of the four sequels she will be starring in (though the plural “sequels” is being used). Lachlan Murdoch also said this week that the four Avatar sequels will be the most expensive films ever made. There’s no word yet about what the sequels will be called, or what font will be used for the titles.2. ANSEL ELGORT LANDS LEAD IN PULITZER-WINNING ADAPTATION THE GOLDFINCH(Photo by Wilson Webb/TriStar)The Pulitzer Prize for Fiction rarely guarantees&nbsp;the winning novel will become a bestseller, but 2014’s The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt did spend over 30 weeks on the NYT chart. Hollywood quickly took to Tartt’s tale of an orphaned boy with a connection to 17th century Dutch painter Carel Fabritius’ painting The Goldfinch who matures into a life of crime. When the dust settled, the rights were split between Warner Bros and Amazon Studios (cofinancing the $40 million budget), and the next step was to find a young actor with the right range. Eventually, they decided to go with Ansel Elgort, the star of&nbsp;Baby Driver and The Fault in Our Stars. Elgort’s other upcoming projects include The Billionaire Boys Club (with Taron Egerton), and the John F. Kennedy WWII film, Mayday 109.3. FAST AND FURIOUS SPINOFF PLANNED FOR 2019(Photo by Scott Garfield/Universal Pictures)It was a good news/bad news situation for Fast and the Furious fans this week, though at first it felt like it was all bad. It started on Wednesday as The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;reported that Universal Pictures had pushed the release date of the 9th Fast &amp; Furious film back a year from April 19, 2019 to April 10, 2020 (Easter weekend). The four other movies scheduled for April, 2020 all currently remain untitled and unknown. Tyrese Gibson (who plays Roman) took to Instagram seemingly complaining about the delay, posting, “#FastFamily right? Nah….. it’s about #TeamDewayne.” The next day, the reference to Dwayne Johnson made a bit more sense,&nbsp;when it was announced&nbsp;that Universal’s new plans for 2019 now involve the Fast and Furious spinoff featuring the characters played by Johnson and Jason Statham. The as-yet-untitled spinoff is now scheduled for July 26, 2019, which is the same weekend as the recently announced Terminator 6.4. BOB’S BURGERS TO BE SERVED UP AS A MOVIE IN THE SUMMER OF 2020(Photo by Fox)Although FOX never did give the world movies based on Futurama, King of the Hill, or even The Family Guy (yet), one of the network’s most recent animated comedies will in 2020. The show in question is called Bob’s Burgers, and it concerns a family, the Belchers: “Bob Belcher runs a hamburger restaurant in a seaside town with his ever-optimistic wife Linda and their three children: the self-conscious Tina, goofball Gene, and precocious Louise.” Bob’s Burgers is currently in its eighth season, and in late 2020, it will be starting its eleventh season. Fox has scheduled the Bob’s Burgers movie for July 17, 2020, which puts it a week after Indiana Jones 5, and the week before an untitled DC Comics movie, and a Sony Animation release. Bob’s Burgers currently has a Fresh Tomatometer score of 89%.5. JUDY GREER JOINS JAMIE LEE CURTIS IN NEXT YEAR’S HALLOWEEN(Photo by Moving Pictures Film and Television courtesy Everett Collection)Three weeks ago, The Weekly Ketchup led with the news that next year’s Halloween sequel-as-reboot had recruited Jamie Lee Curtis to return as Laurie Strode (despite, you know, her character dying in 2002’s Halloween: Resurrection). If Laurie Strode dies a second time next year, the franchise may have a new heroine to carry the franchise,&nbsp;because Judy Greer has been cast as her adult daughter, Karen Strode. Although she’s frequently had supporting roles (like in Jurassic World and Ant-Man), Greer stays super busy, with over eight upcoming movies, including Clint Eastwood’s The 15:17 to Paris, Richard Linklater’s Where’d You Go Bernadette, and Marvel’s sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp.6.&nbsp;DEATH WISH&nbsp;REMAKE DELAYED FROM NEXT MONTH TO NEXT YEAR(Photo by MGM)This week, MGM announced that&nbsp;they are pulling&nbsp;Eli Roth’s remake of&nbsp;Death Wish&nbsp;starring Bruce Willis from next month (11/22/17), in lieu of a release on March 2, 2018 instead. The official take is that Thanksgiving is too crowded (Coco,&nbsp;Polaroid,&nbsp;Molly’s Game, and&nbsp;Chappaquiddick), but the problem with that logic is that March 2, 2018 is the release date for two action movies (Alpha&nbsp;and&nbsp;Red Sparrow) that would be direct competition for a&nbsp;Death Wish&nbsp;remake. That cognitive dissonance also supports&nbsp;pieces like this&nbsp;that&nbsp;speculate the move has more to do with Sunday’s&nbsp;Las Vegas massacre. Netflix&nbsp;also cancelled an event&nbsp;this weekend for Marvel’s&nbsp;The Punisher, with a release date still&nbsp;to be announced for later this fall. Regardless of whether or not&nbsp;Death Wish and&nbsp;The Punisher end up being any good, their postponement was probably the right thing to do.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN REMAKE POSTPONEDSometimes, a given week’s news isn’t just a single story, but a cascading effect of related stories. First, we heard that director Bill Condon (Dreamgirls, Beauty and the Beast) and Universal Pictures were postponing the early 2018 production of their Bride of Frankenstein remake. This quickly led to speculation that Universal&nbsp;was stepping back from its Dark Universe franchise ideas. Soon after, Bride of Frankenstein was also pulled from Universal’s schedule, where it had been slated for February 14, 2019 (Valentine’s Day). Javier Bardem was to play Frankenstein’s Monster, with Angelina Jolie sought to play “The Bride,” but Condon is now saying that if Jolie doesn’t sign on, Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot might be his choice instead. Jolie herself&nbsp;will be filming Maleficent 2 next year.&nbsp;2. JACKIE CHAN SAYS RUSH HOUR 4 IS NO LONGER STUCK IN DEVELOPMENT TRAFFIC(Photo by New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)Although Rush Hour received a Tomatometer score of 60%, the two sequels did not (52% for Rush Hour 2, 18% for Rush Hour 3). That third movie came out ten years ago, but based on what Jackie Chan said this week (while promoting next week’s The Foreigner), the principals still want to continue the franchise. Talking to a radio station in Los Angeles, Chan said that after years of disagreements about a Rush Hour 4 script, “Yesterday, we just agreed.” It’s not yet known if Brett Ratner will return to direct Rush Hour 4, especially since he’s also in the news with his Hugh Hefner biopic.1. SUICIDE SQUAD‘S JOKER JARED LETO TO PLAY NON-VILLAINOUS PLAYBOY HUGH HEFNER(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)The death of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner on September 27, 2017 has been received by sentiments like “Good Riddance” and “no feminist anywhere will shed a tear at his death” on one side.&nbsp; Those are balanced by more sympathetic takes like his “sad secrets,” and this eulogy from producer Brett Ratner, on the other. That last take is absolutely super-relevant because Ratner (Rush Hour 3, X-Men: The Last Stand) (and his Ratpac Entertainment) has been working since April on a Hugh Hefner biopic. That’s why the pieces were already in place enough that RatPac was prepared to announce that Jared Leto (Suicide Squad, Requiem for a Dream) will play Hugh Hefner in the yet-untitled biopic. Ratner also has plans to reboot Hugh Hefner’s 1969 late-night talk show Playboy After Dark for TV.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"medical, canceled, spanish, universe, watch, 21st, Nominations, Plus","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/06141043/Verbinski-Tatum-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"gore-verbinski-may-direct-the-channing-tatum-gambit-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509185873250","title":"Logan Director James Mangold Is Planning a Laura Spinoff, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Logan Director James Mangold Is Planning a Laura Spinoff, and More NewsDC's Deathstroke and Dora the Explorer get their own movies, Ben Mendelsohn will antagonize Captain Marvel, and Justin Lin returns to the Fast and Furious.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 27, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Captain Marvel, Deathstroke, Dora the Explorer, and the Logan spinoff Laura.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHE WOLVERINE FRANCHISE TO BE CLONED BY LOGAN SPINOFF LAURA(Photo by Ben Rothstein/20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Marvel Comics has had pretty great success with the female Wolverine clone X-23, including two mini-series and two ongoing series. To movie fans, however, that same character, who debuted earlier this year in Logan, is known only as “Laura.”&nbsp;Logan was both a box office and a critical success, and its ending left room for a sequel focusing on Laura’s further adventures, so this week’s news is not really that surprising. That’s especially true, given the warm reception fans and critics alike gave to Hugh Jackman’s 11-year-old costar, Spanish-British actress Dafne Keen. Logan director James Mangold is now working with screenwriter Craig Kyle (who first created X-23 for the X-Men: Evolution animated series) on a treatment for a spinoff movie that they’re calling Laura. 20th Century Fox is now planning on three X-Men movies a year, starting in 2018 with The New Mutants (4/13/18), Deadpool 2 (6/1/18), and X-Men: Dark Phoenix (11/2/18).Fresh Developments1. DC COMICS ANTI-HERO DEATHSTROKE TO GET HIS OWN MOVIE STARRING JOE MANGANIELLO(Photo by Claudette Barius/Warner Bros. Pictures)With two major publishers dominating the nearly 80 year history of superhero comics, there are many examples of DC and Marvel having similar characters, such as Green Arrow/Hawkeye, The Flash/Quicksilver, and The Atom/Ant-Man. In some situations (as with Aquaman and Sub-Mariner), it’s actually the character introduced second who somehow becomes more popular. Especially after last year’s movie, Deadpool is arguably way, way more famous now than DC’s Deathstroke (incidentally, their street names are Wade Wilson and Slade Wilson, respectively). For a while, it seemed like Deathstroke would be the main villain in the upcoming Batman solo movie, but more recent reports have suggested he won’t be. Instead, we learned this week that Warner Bros is developing a solo movie for Deathstroke instead. Joe Manganiello remains attached to play Deathstroke in the film to be directed by&nbsp; Gareth Evans (The Raid: Redemption, The Raid 2). Slade Wilson originally called himself&nbsp;Deathstroke the Terminator, but the second half was dropped by DC Comics after the success of James Cameron’s The Terminator.2. BEN MENDELSOHN TO LEAD VILLAINS IN CAPTAIN MARVEL(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Some casting announcements make so much in retrospect that they can inspire forehead-slapping “oh right” reactions. When Marvel announced in April that Captain Marvel (3/8/19) will be directed by the team of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (It’s King of a Funny Story, Mississippi Grind), the answer to “who will they cast as the villain?” was right there for anyone who thought to look. We say that because Ryan Reynolds’ costar in Mississippi Grind was Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn, who played a villain in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and will do the same in two films in 2018: Ready Player One and Robin Hood (as the Sheriff of Nottingham). Mendelsohn is now in talks with Marvel Studios to costar in Captain Marvel as the film’s main villain, which TheWrap is reporting will be the leader of the shapeshifting alien race,&nbsp;the Skrulls. There was also recently a rumor that Fox may be introducing the Skrulls to their own Marvel franchise in X-Men: Dark Phoenix, which is scheduled for four months earlier (11/2/18).3. FOUR-TIME FAST &amp; FURIOUS DIRECTOR RETURNS FOR 9 &amp; 10(Photo by Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures)Earlier this month, Fast &amp; Furious franchise costar Tyrese Gibson took to Instagram seemingly&nbsp;to complain about the delay of the 9th film (from 2019 to April 10, 2020) because Dwayne Johnson’s spinoff with Jason Statham will be released in 2019 instead. It took a few weeks, but Vin Diesel took to his Facebook profile Wednesday to make two announcements about the future of the franchise. Director Justin Lin, who Diesel called the “forefather of Fast,” and who directed a string of four movies (Tokyo Drift to Fast &amp; Furious 6), will return to the franchise to direct the final Fast &amp; Furious films (#9 and #10). Other films Justin Lin reportedly has in development include Hot Wheels, Space Jam 2, and The Bourne Legacy 2.4.&nbsp;AVENGERS 4 SET PHOTOS SUGGEST NEW IDENTITY FOR JEREMY RENNER’S HAWKEYE(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)The thing about early “spoilers” in this day and age is that such revelations often show up in the trailers anyway. Regardless, if you don’t want to know anything else about the yet-untitled Avengers 4 (5/3/19), which comes after Avengers: Infinity War (5/4/18), this would be an excellent place to stop reading. Last month, rumors started showing up online that Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton (AKA Hawkeye) might be taking on a new identity, namely Ronin. This week, images of Renner walking to the Avengers 4 set in costume revealed that he is wearing the Ronin boots and pants. In the comics, the Ronin identity has been used not just by Hawkeye, but also Echo, Red Guardian, Blade, and Ultimate Moon Knight. As for what Hawkeye taking on the Ronin identity will actually mean within the context of Avengers 4, we still have no clue.5.&nbsp;CLOUD ATLAS STAR TOM HANKS RETURNS TO THE POST-APOCALYPSE WITH BIOS(Photo by Warner Bros.)One of the most jarring concepts in the 2012 science fiction film Cloud Atlas was the decision to cast “America’s Sweetheart” Tom Hanks as a post-apocalyptic primitive (though something similar was done with Cast Away). Well, the mastermind behind David S. Pumpkins isn’t done with the post-apocalypse quite yet, because Tom Hanks will star in a science fiction drama called Bios as a dying inventor who creates a robot to look after his beloved dog after his death. Bios will be the second feature film (after 2010’s Repo Men) directed by Miguel Sapochnik, who may be best known for his work on four episodes of TV’s Game of Thrones. Although he didn’t work on Season 7, Sapochnik directed back-to-back episodes in both Season 5 (The Gift, Hardhome) and Season 6 (Battle of the Bastards, for which he won an Emmy, and The Winds of Winter). Tom Hanks’ next film role will be as Ben Bradlee in&nbsp; Steven Spielberg’s The Post (12/22/17), about the Pentagon Papers.6.&nbsp;STAR WARS‘&nbsp;ADAM DRIVER JOINS SPIKE LEE’S BLACK KLANSMAN(Photo by Jessica Miglio/Warner Bros.)Before Samuel L. Jackson first played Mace Windu in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, he had already appeared in four Spike Lee “joints” (School Daze, Do the Right Thing, Mo’ Better Blues, Jungle Fever). Now, another Star Wars star is getting ready to make the opposite transition. The actor in question is Adam Driver, who plays Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and December’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Driver will co-star in Spike Lee’s next film as director, Black Klansman, which is based on the true story of Colorado Springs police detective Ron Stallworth, an African-American who posed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan as part of a sting operation, eventually rising to a leadership position. Adam Driver will play a fellow police officer, with Stallworth himself being played by John David Washington&nbsp;(of HBO’s Ballers). Laura Harrier, who played Liz in this summer’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, was also recently cast in Black Klansman.7. DORA THE EXPLORER&nbsp;TO BE ADAPTED INTO A LIVE-ACTION FILM(Photo by Nickelodeon)In 2011, screenwriter Nicholas Stoller adapted Generation X favorites The Muppets for their return to the big screen. Now, Stoller (who’s also directed such films as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Neighbors) is working on a screenplay adaptation of animated TV series Dora the Explorer (2000-2015), which is now in development to be adapted by Paramount as a live-action movie for release in 2019. Although Dora&nbsp;was a young child and then a “tween” in her animated series, she will be portrayed as a teenager for the live-action movie. She&nbsp;is expected to have her talking pet monkey Boots, as well as her backpack and map, which are also&nbsp;able to talk to her. Dora the Explorer will be produced by Michael Bay’s Platinum Dunes production company, but Bay himself is not directly producing.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. THE PURGE FRANCHISE&nbsp;ANNOUNCES A PREQUEL(Photo by Daniel McFadden/Universal)All three of the entries in Universal’s horror/thriller franchise that started with The Purge have received Rotten Tomatometer scores (and comparable RT Audience scores). That said, they&nbsp;have had fairly consistent box office results on relatively small budgets, so you can probably guess whether there’s going to be a fourth movie. The answer is “yes,” and it’s going to be a prequel called The Purge: The Island (set on NYC’s Staten Island) that will depict the circumstances that led to the annual event in which all crimes are legal for 12 hours. Perhaps inspired by Universal’s success earlier this year with Get Out, six of the eight announced cast members are black or African-American, with the film’s director saying recently that the cast is “90% black.” The Purge: The Island is already scheduled for July 4, 2018 (just a few days before Marvel’s Ant-Man and the Wasp), but it’s a Rotten Idea based on the franchise’s Tomatometer record.1. HOLLYWOOD&nbsp;REMAKE FEVER: ACE VENTURA, MAJOR LEAGUE, AND YOUNG GUNS(Photo by Warner Bros.)Although we keep getting remakes that fall “flat” (like last month’s&nbsp;Flatliners), attempts to translate that into an anti-remake narrative are deflated by remakes like IT. There are also the “remake TV shows” like The Handmaid’s Tale, Westworld, The Exorcist, and Lethal Weapon to consider. Both of those types of reboots have led the newly rebranded Morgan Creek Entertainment Group (the company behind The Exorcist) to announce their plans to revive their catalog of titles as either movie remakes, new TV shows, or possibly both. The three multi-film franchises that were mentioned are Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, the baseball comedy Major League, and the western Young Guns. The other films are mostly thrillers (Dead Ringers, Diabolique, Pacific Heights), plus one horror film (Clive Barker’s Nightbreed). Ace Ventura and Young Guns are being eyed as both movie reboots and TV shows, with Dead Ringers and Nightbreed being developed as TV shows.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Musicals, canceled, toy, Fox, Ellie, PaleyFest, book, documentaries, ABC, Pop, FOX, Cartoon, laika, Disney, Brie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/27172924/Logan-Dafne-Keen-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"logan-director-james-mangold-is-planning-a-laura-spinoff-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509185860957","title":"Tarantino’s Next Film to Be Released on 50th Anniversary of Manson Family Murders, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Tarantino's Next Film to Be Released on 50th Anniversary of Manson Family Murders, and More Movie NewsThe Avengers: Infinity War trailer breaks records, Disney casts its live-action Mulan, Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne reunite, and James Franco tackles another biopic.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 1, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you eleven headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Quentin Tarantino’s next film,&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War, Disney’s live action Mulan, and Star Wars: Episode IX.This WEEK’S TOP STORYQUENTIN TARANTINO’S #9 TO BE RELEASED ON 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MANSON FAMILY MURDERS(Photo by Weinstein Company)Traditionally, Quentin Tarantino’s movies have been released in the&nbsp;late months of the year&nbsp;(the exceptions being&nbsp;Grindhouse&nbsp;and&nbsp;Inglourious Basterds). All of those films,&nbsp;however, were also released back when Tarantino’s films were distributed by&nbsp;you-know-who.&nbsp;But his still untitled “1969 Hollywood” movie (AKA #9) is now based at Sony Pictures, and perhaps to mark how they’ll handle Tarantino differently,&nbsp;the studio&nbsp;has picked a date in the summer of 2019: August 9, 2019, to be precise. That date also carries an important symbolic importance, as it marks the 50th anniversary of the&nbsp;Tate/Manson Family murders,&nbsp;which provide part of the historical background of Tarantino’s film. Warner Bros has also scheduled their&nbsp;Shaft&nbsp;sequel/reboot (possibly called&nbsp;Son of Shaft) for June 14, 2019.&nbsp;Other new 2019 release dates&nbsp;are&nbsp;The Goldfinch&nbsp;(starring Ansel Elgort) on October 11, 2019, and&nbsp;the reboot of&nbsp;Hellboy&nbsp;on January 11, 2019.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR&nbsp;TRAILER DEBUTS – WHAT WE SAW (AND WHAT WE DIDN’T)(Photo by Marvel Studios)As you&nbsp;may&nbsp;have noticed if you have any sort of&nbsp;social media awareness, the trailer for Marvel’s&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;debuted this week&nbsp;(and&nbsp;broke records&nbsp;in the process). Marvel is playing up the May 4, 2018 superhero extravaganza as being the “finale” of the saga&nbsp;they’ve&nbsp;unfolded&nbsp;since at least 2011’s&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;(the first movie to show one of the&nbsp;Infinity Stones). And we know one of the reasons this is true is that Marvel’s many, many contracts are&nbsp;close to expiring. As such, the focus in this first trailer is not just on supervillain Thanos (Josh Brolin), but also the new generation of Avengers like&nbsp;Doctor Strange&nbsp;(Benedict Cumberbatch),&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;(Chadwick Boseman), Vision (Paul Bettany), and the “you guys” at the end. The characters that&nbsp;we don’t see&nbsp;in this first trailer also might be of interest.&nbsp;They include Paul Rudd’s&nbsp;Ant-Man&nbsp;and Evangeline Lilly’s&nbsp;The Wasp, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Maria Hill (Cobie Smulder), and Thanos’ other daughter, Nebula (Karen Gillan). Is it possible some of these characters might feature more prominently in the still-untitled&nbsp;Avengers 4&nbsp;(5/3/19)?2.&nbsp;THEORY OF EVERYTHING STARS TO REUNITE FOR AMAZON’S BALLOON BIOPIC THE AERONAUTS(Photo by Liam Daniel/Focus Features)We tend to take it for granted that we can hop on a giant metal tube that launches you into the sky. Skipping back 150+ years, though, would you get into a basket attached to a huge balloon and hope you know how to land that thing? Such is the inherent drama in The Aeronauts, Amazon Studios’ newest awards hopeful, which they’ve been developing for the past year. This week, the awards appeal of The Aeronauts escalated with the news that it will reunite the stars of 2014’s The Theory of Everything: Academy Award Best Actor winner Eddie Redmayne and Best Actress nominee Felicity Jones. Redmayne and Jones are in talks to play the film’s 1862 historical figures, scientist James Glaisher and balloon pilot Amelia Wren. Tom Harper (Peaky Blinders) will be directing, with filming aiming to start in London in early 2018.3. JAMES FRANCO TO FOLLOW THE DISASTER ARTIST WITH SHEL SILVERSTEIN BIOPIC(Photo by A24)This weekend sees the release of James Franco’s The Disaster Artist, based on actor Greg Sestero’s experiences with friend and director Tommy Wiseau, and the movie is Certified Fresh at 95% to boot. Franco is&nbsp;super prolific as director, but some of his movies (like The Disaster Artist) understandably earn much more notice than others. Franco’s latest such project is an adaptation of the biography A Boy Named Shel, which depicts the life story of Shel Silverstein, the famous poet, songwriter, and children’s author. James Franco will direct and star as Shel Silverstein, despite really not looking anything at all like Shel Silverstein. Then again, that’s what a lot of people thought about him playing Wiseau until they actually saw&nbsp;The Disaster Artist.4. RUSSELL CROWE TEASES THE POSSIBILITY OF A SECOND MASTER AND COMMANDER(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)If&nbsp;you could spin the clock way back to 2003, you might find yourself in the same mindset of many fiction fans who were excited about Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (Certified Fresh at 85%). The allure was that The Far Side of the World was an adaptation of one of the 20 novels in author Patrick O’Brian’s Aubrey-Maturin series of books of nautical adventures set in the early 19th century. Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World also featured Russell Crowe in a starring role just a few years after Gladiator&nbsp;and director Peter Weir coming off The Truman Show. And then… it never went any further. However,&nbsp;Master and Commander fans may take heart, as Russell Crowe took to Twitter this week to hint, “For the Aubrey Maturin lovers, I do hear whispers indeed that a second voyage is perhaps potentially pre-proposed a possibility. So O’Brian affectionate’s and aficionados , let @20thcenturyfox know of your pleasure.” So, that’s a… maybe?5. CHINESE ACTRESS LIU YIFEI CAST AS DISNEY’S LIVE ACTION MULAN(Photo by Lionsgate)Last year, a spec script for Walt Disney Pictures’ live-action remake of 1998’s Mulan sparked concerns that the Chinese epic would be “whitewashed.” In the past year, Disney and director Niki Caro (Whale Rider, The Zookeeper’s Wife) have seen nearly 1,000 candidates for the lead role from across five different continents, and in the end, the winner was indeed from China. Disney’s live action Mulan will be played by Liu Yifei, AKA “Crystal Liu.” The films featuring Liu Yifei that have been released in the USA include The Forbidden Kingdom and Ip Man 3. Disney hopes to start filming soon to meet a release date sometime in 2019.6. KERRY WASHINGTON AND RASHIDA JONES TEAM UP FOR TEEN DETECTIVE&nbsp;FILM&nbsp;GOLDIE VANCE(Photo by ABC, DreamWorks)We may never get a TV crossover between Scandal and Angie Tribeca, but that’s not stopping their respective stars from teaming up. Kerry Washington and&nbsp;Rashida Jones&nbsp;are teaming up with 20th Century Fox for an adaptation of the BOOM! Studios series of Goldie Vance graphic novels. Jones will write and direct the first Goldie Vance feature film, and Washington will produce through her Simpson Street production company (there’s no word yet about either co-starring in the movie). Goldie Vance depicts the adventures of “a 16-year-old mixed-race girl who dreams of becoming the in-house detective at a historic Miami resort.” Goldie Vance&nbsp;will be&nbsp;Rashida Jones’ feature film directorial debut.7. JUDY HOLLIDAY BIOPIC SMART BLONDE TO DEPICT GOLDEN AGE HOLLYWOOD HARASSMENTThere have now been dozens of women who have come out against Harvey Weinstein,&nbsp;as well as allegations against dozens of other contemporary Hollywood figures. It perhaps goes without saying (especially considering Weinstein’s&nbsp;own official statement), but today’s justice is long, long, overdue. One figure who we now know endured sexual harassment during Hollywood’s Golden Age is Born Yesterday star Judy Holliday. Rocky producer Gene Kirkwood is now developing a feature film based on Holliday’s true story, which will be adapted as a biopic called Smart Blonde. In addition to Holliday’s intelligence (I.Q. 172!) and eventual 1950s blacklisting, Smart Blonde will depict her alleged sexual harassment by powerful mogul Darryl F. Zanuck.8.WILL DAISY RIDLEY BE DONE AS REY AFTER EPISODE IX?(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Lucasfilm Ltd.)Despite the rather spoilery info producer Kathleen Kennedy spilled a few weeks back, Daisy Ridley is saying things that suggest quite the opposite this week. In an interview with Rolling Stone&nbsp;about Star Wars: Episode IX (title pending), due out December 20th, 2019, Ridley spoke about her future&nbsp;as heroine Rey (or more to the point, not playing Rey). The relevant quotes are, “I am really, really excited to do the third thing and round it out, because ultimately, what I was signing on to was three films… So in my head, it’s three films. I think it will feel like the right time to round it out.” Episode IX being the end of Rey’s story also begs another question, which The Hollywood Reporter addressed this week, asking what exactly “the Skywalker saga” even is.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. BLAXPLOITATION CLASSICS CLEOPATRA JONES AND SUPERFLY BOTH UP FOR REMAKESNew Line Cinema’s revamp of the&nbsp;Shaft franchise is prepping for a big release on June 14, 2019, and this appears to be prompting other producers to consider their own revisits to 1970s “blaxploitation” classics. Warner Bros. (the parent company of New Line Cinema) is now actively developing a remake of the 1973 film Cleopatra Jones, which starred Tamara Dobson as “the undercover government agent who used the day job of supermodel as her cover and an excuse to travel to exotic places.” Misha Green, the showrunner behind the recent TV series Underground, is now working on adapting Cleopatra Jones as a modern female spy movie, a la James Bond. Sony Pictures is also now developing a remake of Superfly, to be written by Alex Tse (cowriter of Zack Snyder’s Watchmen). We’re calling both mildly “Rotten Ideas” because they’re remakes, and the original films are already “Fresh” (91% for Superfly, 90% for Cleopatra Jones).1. RUH-RO. SCOOBY-DOO TO GET LIVE ACTION PREQUEL ABOUT DAPHNE AND VELMA(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)We’ve known for several years now that Warner Bros. wants to get back into the Scooby-Doo feature film business. In the past, this has included talk about both animated and live-action films, but this week’s news is still surprising. Ashley and Jennifer Tisdale, through their Blondie Girl Productions, have made a deal with Warner Bros. to make a Scooby-Doo prequel called Daphne and Velma. As you can guess from the title, the&nbsp;film will show how the two girls on the Mystery Inc. team joined up before meeting Fred, Shaggy, and Scooby-Doo. Sarah Jeffrey (Shades of Blue) will play Daphne, and Sarah Gilman (Last Man Standing) will play Velma. Although Daphne and Velma is being produced by Warner Bros. Television Group, that doesn’t necessarily exclude a theatrical release, as Teen Titans Go! to the Movies is getting a theatrical release next summer (7/27/18).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"John, Plus, CW","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/01205746/Quentin-Tarantino-Ketchup2.jpg","slug":"tarantinos-next-film-to-be-released-on-50th-anniversary-of-manson-family-murders-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509185869152","title":"Rian Johnson Will Bring Us A New Star Wars Trilogy, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rian Johnson Will Bring Us A New Star Wars Trilogy, and More Movie NewsDisney and Fox might make a deal, Universal's Dark Universe might be dead, and new roles for Sandra Bullock, Carey Mulligan, and Ashley Judd.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 10, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Red Sonja, Suicide Squad 2, and the future of the Star Wars franchise.This WEEK’S TOP STORYNEW STAR WARS TRILOGY COMING FROM THE LAST JEDI DIRECTOR RIAN JOHNSON(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)It was just last week that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy teased the post-Episode IX future of the Star Wars franchise (with spoilers). Possibly aware that these sorts of secrets stay secret only very briefly in today’s social media world, StarWars.com made a&nbsp;huge announcement this week. The revelation involves director Rian Johnson (Looper, Brick, The Brothers Bloom), whose first Star Wars movie is next month’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi. An emphasis should be put on first, because the big news is that Johnson is creating a new Star Wars trilogy which will launch after J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars: Episode IX (12/20/19). Rian Johnson will write and produce this new trilogy and direct the first entry.&nbsp;The new trilogy is still mostly shrouded in mystery, except that, “separate from the episodic Skywalker saga, Johnson will introduce new characters from a corner of the galaxy that Star Wars lore has never before explored.” That last part touches upon a common complaint about the “Star Wars story” movies (Rogue One and the upcoming Solo), which is that they don’t expand the Star Wars universe enough. In related news, Disney has revived plans for a live action Star Wars TV series which is now planned to launch on their upcoming streaming app before the end of 2019.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;COULD DISNEY UNITE FOX’S&nbsp;X-MEN AND FANTASTIC FOUR WITH THE MCU?(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)As of this writing, the talks appear to be more “off again”, but this week, Marvel fans (in particular) were sent into a swoon with the news that Disney had had talks about possibly buying and/or merging with 21st Century Fox. If such a deal were to happen, it would probably focus on the film divisions (for various reasons), and would extend Disney’s reach beyond family fare to include such franchises as Alien, Avatar, and Planet of the Apes, and working relationships with several major directors. The biggest change such a deal would mean is that some of Marvel’s most popular characters, like X-Men, Wolverine, Deadpool, Silver Surfer, and Fantastic Four (and villains like Doctor Doom, Galactus, and Kang) could be united with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (The Avengers, etc). One character fans immediately speculated this news&nbsp;might affect greatly&nbsp;was Deadpool, who at Fox is allowed to be spectacularly R-rated. (In related news, Deadpool 2 was promoted this week by a new poster and a special issue of Good Housekeeping).2. KEVIN SPACEY REMOVED FROM ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD(Photo by Aidan Monaghan/TriStar Pictures)It’s not uncommon for an actor to sport&nbsp;transformative makeup to portray an older character, but it does make one wonder why the producers don’t just cast someone who’s actually, you know, the right age. That was definitely a thought this writer had watching the first trailer for All the Money in the World, in which Kevin Spacey (58 years old) was to play J. Paul Getty, who was 81 when his grandson was kidnapped in 1973. Following the continuing accusations against Spacey, Sony Pictures was left with a major awards season contender&nbsp;that&nbsp;became&nbsp;nearly unreleasable. In response, director Ridley Scott has gone with his original choice, 87-year-old Christopher Plummer, who has already started reshoots of the approximately 10 minutes the J. Paul Getty Sr. role has in the film. Sony is sticking with the December 22, 2017 release date. Coincidentally, Getty’s kidnapped grandson is played by Charlie Plummer (no relation).3. SANDRA BULLOCK JOINS ANTI-ABORTION TRUE STORY LET HER SPEAK(Photo by Warner Bros.)Sandra Bullock’s last film as actress, Our Brand is Crisis, came out over two years ago, but Bullock is now in the midst of a new wave of activity. She’s already wrapped filming of the spinoff Ocean’s Eight (6/8/18), and is about to start filming the post-apocalyptic drama Bird Box for Danish director Susanne Bier. Now, Bullock has joined a true story drama called Let Her Speak, in which she will star as Texas senator Wendy Davis. On June 25, 2013, Senator Davis filibustered for 11 hours to block Senate Bill 5, which included “more restrictive abortion regulations for Texas and would have closed all abortion clinics in the state.” Let Her Speak does not yet have a director attached, and the package (the script and Bullock’s involvement) will next be shopped to various studios. Sandra Bullock is a former resident of Austin, Texas.4. CAREY MULLIGAN’S GLORIA STEINEM BIOPIC AN UNCIVIL WAR TAKES ON JULIANNE MOORE’S(Photo by Focus Features)It was just last week that the&nbsp;Weekly Ketchup reported that Julianne Moore will star in My Life on the Road, based on the life story of famed feminist activist Gloria Steinem. Just after that article debuted, news broke about casting for a separate Gloria Steinem biopic, creating a “duelling movies” situation where separate films with the same concept compete against each other. Carey Mulligan will star as Gloria Steinem in An Uncivil War for director Dee Rees, whose Mudbound opens next week. In the past, duelling biopics have included Prefontaine and Without Limits (both about runner Steve Prefontaine); and Capote and Infamous (about Truman Capote and In Cold Blood).5. TEEN STAR ASHER ANGEL CAST AS SHAZAM! ALTER EGO BILLY BATSON(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)After years of development, Warner Bros. subsidiary New Line Cinema finally announced that Zachary Levi will star as superhero Shazam! (and that Mark Strong will play the film’s villain, Doctor Sivana). Shazam! is sort of an unusual case because the title character is a young boy who transforms into an adult superhero, so he has to be played by two different actors. Levi will portray the hero, and we now know that his younger counterpart, Billy Batson (variably portrayed as either a pre-teen or a teenager),&nbsp;will be played by 15-year-old Asher Angel (of TV’s Andi Mack). Filming of Shazam! is scheduled to start in early 2018 under the direction of David F. Sandberg (Lights Out, Annabelle: Creation), and it’s expected to be released sometime in 2019.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4. ASHLEY JUDD WILL KNOW&nbsp;A DOG’S WAY HOME(Photo by Showtime)Author W. Bruce Cameron scored something of a licensing home run&nbsp;with his very first book, 2001’s 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter: And Other Tips from a Beleaguered Father (Not That Any of Them Work), which was adapted by ABC into a sitcom (and probably would have&nbsp;lasted longer than three seasons if not for the death of original star John Ritter). Most of Cameron’s books since then, however, have involved dogs, starting with 2010’s A Dog’s Purpose: A Novel for Humans, which itself was adapted this year into a poorly reviewed movie with&nbsp;something of a troublesome release. Cameron’s&nbsp;most recent novel is called A Dog’s Way Home, and it too is now being adapted by Sony as a faith-based movie. Ashley Judd, Edward James-Olmos (Battlestar Galactica), and Alexandra Shipp (Storm from X-Men: Apocalypse) are all attached to co-star for director Charles Martin Smith (Air Bud, Dolphin Tale).&nbsp;A Dog’s Way Home is Judd’s first new film since the Harvey Weinstein allegations.3.&nbsp;CONAN THE BARBARIAN PRODUCERS STILL WORKING ON RED SONJA SPINOFFThe movie rights to some of Marvel Comics’ most popular titles from the 1970s&nbsp;are a bit complicated, because Marvel was heavy into licensing deals during that time (read Sean Howe’s Marvel Comics: The Untold Story for more on that). Obviously, titles like Godzilla, Star Wars, and Conan the Barbarian always resided outside Marvel, but characters created for those comics vary (Marvel’s Machine Man, for example, was created for the 2001: A Space Odyssey comic). The chainmail bikini-wearing warrior Red Sonja was created for Conan the Barbarian and quickly became one of Marvel’s most popular 1970s comics, but Marvel didn’t retain any film or TV rights. Brigitte Nielsen starred in a 1985 Red Sonja film (Rotten at 15% on the Tomatometer), but later attempts at a Red Sonja movie (like the one starring Rose McGowan) never came to fruition. That may soon change, as Millennium Media (of the 2011&nbsp;Conan the Barbarian, which is Rotten at 24% and, incidentally, co-stars McGowan) has restarted development on a new Red Sonja movie.2. THE MUMMY&nbsp;MAY HAVE BURIED UNIVERSAL’S DARK UNIVERSE(Photo by Universal Pictures)As we head into the tail end of the year, studios continue to wring their hands over box office&nbsp;numbers (see:&nbsp;this widely shared piece about Blade Runner 2049). Any would-be franchise obviously can be stalled by box office disappointment (Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie, for example, might be the last epic movie too). Universal’s The Mummy&nbsp;(Rotten at just 16% on the Tomatometer), however, was&nbsp;specifically intended&nbsp;to launch an entire “cinematic universe” for Universal (a la Marvel) called Dark Universe. Well, with the departure of the masterminds of that plan, Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan, this week, it now appears Dark Universe may never come to be (at least not as planned). This comes just a month after Universal delayed production on Bride of Frankenstein&nbsp;and cancelled the film’s 2/14/19 release date. It’s still possible that some of the reboots might happen, such as The Invisible Man, Van Helsing, or The Creature from the Black Lagoon, but they may no longer be interconnected.1. DWAYNE JOHNSON’S BLACK ADAM MAY DEBUT IN SUICIDE SQUAD 2(Photo by HBO)Until relatively recently, Warner Bros. planned for Shazam! to feature the debut of Dwayne Johnson’s anti-hero&nbsp;Black Adam&nbsp;(leading up to his own solo movie). Then, when we learned Zachary Levi was cast as Shazam!&nbsp;and Mark Strong would play the film’s villain, Doctor Sivana, it was also confirmed that Dwayne Johnson’s Black Adam would not appear in Shazam! after all. This week, multiple sources told The Wrap that the new plan involves Suicide Squad 2, which is expected to start filming next October after Shazam! The reported premise of Suicide Squad 2&nbsp;involves the team being “tasked with tracking down a weapon of mass destruction,” with that weapon being Black Adam himself. Suicide Squad 2 will be directed by Gavin O’Connor, who is coming off the The Accountant (Rotten at 52%), and of course, Suicide Squad itself&nbsp;only earned a 26% on the Tomatometer.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"richard, FOX, Chernobyl, south, Rey, Christmas, action, CBS, Marvel, Paramount, Video","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/10184637/Rian-Johnson-Star-Wars-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"rian-johnson-will-bring-us-a-new-star-wars-trilogy-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509187540328","title":"Jamie Lee Curtis to Return to Halloween Franchise Next Year, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jamie Lee Curtis to Return to Halloween Franchise Next Year, and More Movie NewsJ.J.

John Carpenter, director of the original&nbsp;film, will be executive producing, and said at the time, “I might even do the music.” The 11th film’s new director will be formerly indie helmer David Gordon Green (Pineapple Express, Your Highness), who will also co-write with his frequent partner and star Danny McBride (HBO’s Vice Principals). Our first real hint at where the new Halloween will take us came today, with the news that Jamie Lee Curtis will reprise her role as Laurie Strode for the fifth time. Ms. Curtis also suggested a (possibly lethal?) finality to her return, tweeting, “Same porch. Same clothes. Same issues. 40 years later. Headed back to Haddonfield one last time for Halloween.” Although the original Halloween was Certified Fresh, all of the sequels &nbsp;and Rob Zombie reboots were Rotten.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS DIRECTOR TO RETURN FOR STAR WARS EPISODE IX(Photo by James Atoa/Everett Collection)One of last week’s biggest news items concerned the vacuum left behind following Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow’s departure from the highly anticipated Star Wars Episode IX (12/20/19). This move quickly led to columns speculating about replacement directors from sources like indieWire, Observer, and Deadline. Such pieces could have gone on for months, but Lucasfilm quickly put it all to an end with the announcement that Star Wars: Episode IX (title likely to change) will be directed by J.J. Abrams, who directed Episode VII –&nbsp;The Force Awakens. With this move, J.J. Abrams becomes the first director other than George Lucas to direct more than one live action Star Wars movie. Of course, now the editorials are shifting to whether J.J. Abrams directing Episode IX is the “right choice.”2. DISNEY TO START THE SUMMER OF 2019 WITH ALADDIN(Photo by Walt Disney courtesy Everett Collection)The other half of the Star Wars: Episode IX news involving J.J. Abrams is the confirmation that the production will need another seven months to make it to theaters. That means that Star Wars: Episode IX (previously scheduled for May 24th, 2019) will now be released on December 20th, 2019. In its former position on May 24th, 2019, Walt Disney Pictures will now schedule their live action Aladdin (which was until this week their biggest, most imminent, film without a release date). Star Wars: Episode IX (or whatever it ends up being called) is now scheduled one week after Wonder Woman 2 (12/13/19), and on the same date as the long-awaited movie musical Wicked. The live action Aladdin (starring Will Smith as The Genie) faces off against the Minecraft movie on May 24, 2019. You can browse through Disney’s release schedule for 2017 through 2021 as it currently stands right here.3.&nbsp;MARGOT&nbsp;ROBBIE REVEALS SHE DIDN’T REALIZE&nbsp;I, TONYA&nbsp;WAS A TRUE STORY(Photo by Frank Masi/Paramount Pictures)One of the most talked about movies to debut this week at the Toronto International Film Festival is&nbsp;I, Tonya, telling the true story of Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding in the early 1990s.&nbsp;I, Tonya&nbsp;also currently holds a 100% Fresh Tomatometer score, with 17 reviews currently clocked in. Perhaps as a testimony of exactly how bizarrely this true story probably read to a newcomer, Margot Robbie (who plays Tonya Harding) this week admitted that when she first read the script, she thought it was a fictional story. There are, of course, two important points to clarify here. Robbie (Harley Quinn in&nbsp;Suicide Squad) was born in 1990, so when Harding’s competitor Nancy Kerrigan was attacked, she was only&nbsp;3 years old (and Australian to boot).&nbsp;I, Tonya&nbsp;does not yet have a distributor in the USA, and so there is not yet a release date (but it could still become a major awards season contender).4.&nbsp;STRANGER THINGS STAR BEEFS UP TO PLAY&nbsp;THE NEW HELLBOY(Photo by Claire Folger/Exclusive Media Group)Obviously, in this day of CGI, fancy makeup, and costuming, we shouldn’t take what we see for granted. Having said that, our first glimpse this week of Stranger Things star David Harbour as the new Hellboy is startling for exactly how muscular he looks. David Harbour has talked since being cast about his portrayal will differ from Ron Perlman’s as having to “prove that he’s the lion, has to roar, and and I think he struggles with his own masculinity.” You can browse through some Twitter reactions to Harbour’s Hellboy look right here. Meanwhile, the Hellboy reboot also addressed the recent departure of Ed Skrein (as an Asian American character named Major Daimia) with the news that LOST and Hawaii Five-0 star Daniel Dae Kim is now in talks for the role. Kim also quickly made a public statement to “applaud” Ed Skrein’s choice to leave the role as soon as he learned of the character’s ethnicity.5.&nbsp;WAYNE’S WORLD STAR MIKE MYERS TO STAR IN BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY(Photo by Paramount Pictures)By 1992, Queen’s anthem “Bohemian Rhapsody” was a well-established staple of every classic rock radio station in the world, but when Mike Myers, Dana Carvey, and friends sang along to the song in&nbsp;Wayne’s World, it rocketed back into the pop culture consciousness. The connection became even more concrete&nbsp;this week with the news that Myers is signing for a small role in Bohemian Rhapsody, the Freddie Mercury biopic being directed by Bryan Singer (X-Men, The Usual Suspects). It’s not known yet who Myers will be playing, but one intriguing possibility is that he is playing himself, reprising that Wayne’s World singalong. Freddie Mercury will be portrayed&nbsp;by Mr. Robot star Rami Malek.6. WILL JESSICA CHASTAIN STAR AS THE ADULT BEVERLY IN IT CHAPTER 2?(Photo by Richard Foreman Jr./Weinstein Company)One result of New Line Cinema’s decision to cut Stephen King’s massive novel IT into its two separate generational stories is that now a whole new cast of adult stars have to be found for the 2019 sequel, IT Chapter 2. Director Andy Muschietti talked to Variety this week about the shock that IT attracted a $123 million opening weekend, after expecting something more like $80 million. Variety also asked Muschietti about casting the adult versions of the characters for the sequel, specifically bringing up Jessica Chastain, who starred in Muschietti’s popular 2013 horror hit Mama. Muschietti replied, “Jessi is an amazing actress and very good friend and I would love her to play Beverly.” No official negotiations have started yet for the second chapter of IT, but it’s expected New Line Cinema may try to get the movie fast tracked for a release in late 2019.7. JOHN WICK CHAPTER 3 PLANNED FOR&nbsp;SUMMER OF 2019(Photo by David Lee/Summit Entertainmen)Keanu Reeves’ assassin/revenge hit John Wick was released on October 24, 2014, and its sequel John Wick: Chapter 2 earlier this year on February 10, 2017. For the presumed trilogy closer, however, Lionsgate has announced plans to release John Wick: Chapter 3 right in the midst of the early summer blockbuster season, just 20 months from now. John Wick: Chapter 3 may provide moviegoers something of a counterprogramming option on May 17, 2019. The other films announced for that month are mostly “family” entertainment, including Avengers 4 (5/3/19), the animated film Ugly Dolls (5/10/19), the live action Aladdin (5/24/19), and the video game adaptation Minecraft (5/24/19). Director Chad Stahleski has said the third film will focus&nbsp;on “subtleties” and “details,” saying “Hopefully, we make people look at garbage collectors and cleaner vans and homeless people a little differently now.”8. STAN LEE SAYS HIS NEIGHBOR LEONARDO DICAPRIO WANTS TO STAR IN HIS BIOPIC(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Last September, news broke that 20th Century Fox had acquired the life story rights for Marvel Comics editor and writer Stan Lee, with plans to adapt it as more of an “action movie” than a traditional biopic. We haven’t heard much about it since, but this week, Lee himself dropped something of a bomb at Hasbro’s new HASCON convention. In&nbsp;his own words: “Believe it or not, I’ve already discussed it with Leonardo DiCaprio. He’s a neighbor of mine and we were talking one day some months ago, and he said, ‘Boy it’d be fun to do your story on the screen.’ So I said, ‘Well, I’ll audition you.’ Gotta make sure the guy can do it. He has all the walls covered with big Marvel posters and everything. He’s got very good taste.” Leonardo DiCaprio has previously worked with 20th Century Fox on such films as The Revenant, Romeo + Juliet, The Beach, and of course, Titanic.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1. JENNIFER LAWRENCE’S RED SPARROW INVITES COMPARISONS TO MARVEL’S BLACK WIDOW(Photo by 20th Century Fox)There were several interesting new trailers this week, including All the Money in the World, The Disaster Artist, Downsizing, and Fifty Shades Freed. Judging by social media reactions, however, the trailer that may have made the biggest waves&nbsp;may have been for the spy thriller Red Sparrow (3/2/18). The reason for much of it is that people are seeing similarities between Jennifer Lawrence’s role and&nbsp;Scarlett Johansson’s Marvel character Black Widow. Both are Russian spies who are trained from an early age to seduce and assassinate. Red Sparrow is based on a 2013 novel, while Marvel first introduced the “Red Room” backstory for Black Widow in 2005. Marvel Studios has not yet announced a solo Black Widow movie for Scarlett Johansson.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Studios, Hallmark, Shudder, TV, Disney, comic, FOX, on, Diego, 2018, canceled, blockbusters","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/15135007/Jamie-Lee-Curtis-Halloween-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"jamie-lee-curtis-to-return-to-halloween-franchise-next-year-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509187598706","title":"Quentin Tarantino Takes on A Charles Manson Movie, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Quentin Tarantino Takes on A Charles Manson Movie, and More NewsMartin Scorsese casts The Irishman, Clint Eastwood casts real heroes, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds get new roles, and Barry Jenkins adapts James Baldwin.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 14, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about new films from directors Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, Quentin Tarantino, and Moonlight director Barry Jenkins.This WEEK’S TOP STORYQUENTIN TARANTINO’S NINTH FILM TO BE ABOUT THE MANSON FAMILY MURDERS(Photo by Francois Duhamel/Weinstein Company)In the past, director Quentin Tarantino has&nbsp;mentioned an interest&nbsp;in possibly directing a horror film. This week, we discovered that for his ninth (and potentially penultimate) film, Tarantino is indeed adapting a true story very well suited for the genre. For his first feature film based on a true story, Tarantino will write and direct a film based on the infamous “Manson Family Murders”&nbsp;of actress Sharon Tate and other house guests (and more people the next night). Tarantino is already meeting with several A-list stars for the film’s ensemble cast, starting with Margot Robbie, who would be cast as Sharon Tate herself. Tarantino is also talking to his Inglourious Basterds star Brad Pitt (as a detective investigating the murders), frequent collaborator Samuel L. Jackson, and Jennifer Lawrence, who nearly co-starred in 2015’s The Hateful Eight. Contrary to some reports, however, Lawrence is in talks for a role other than Sharon Tate. There is no word yet as to who might play such famous figures connected to the murders as Charles Manson, convicted killer Tex Watson, or director Roman Polanski (Sharon Tate’s husband at the time).Fresh Developments1. MARTIN SCORSESE CASTING UP HIS BIG $100 MILLION NETFLIX GAMBLE THE IRISHMAN(Photo by 20th Century Fox courtesy Everett Collection)Martin Scorsese’s next film will be for Netflix, and it will be an&nbsp;ambitious $100 million gangster movie called The Irishman. Scorsese has been developing it for several years, originally&nbsp;with the title I Heard You Paint Houses, based on Charles Brandt’s non-fiction novel about confessed mob assassin Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran. The full title of the book is I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank ‘The Irishman’ Sheeran and the Inside Story of the Mafia, the Teamsters, and the Final Ride by Jimmy Hoffa, which also serves as the movie’s synopsis (with Al Pacino attached to play Jimmy Hoffa). We’ve known for a while that The Irishman would be a reunion project for Scorsese and Robert De Niro (who’s playing Sheeran), but&nbsp;this week it was officially confirmed that that Joe Pesci would also be co-starring in The Irishman. Then, it was&nbsp;also revealed that Harvey Keitel (who co-starred in Scorsese’s Mean Streets) and Bobby Canavale (who co-starred in Scorsese’s Boardwalk Empire series) are also in talks for roles. The casting news didn’t stop there, as Ray Romano is also on board to play “Bill Bufalino, a teamster lawyer with ties to the mob.” Filming of The Irishman is scheduled to start in September, and Netflix is expected to start streaming the movie sometime in 2018.2. CLINT EASTWOOD CASTS THE REAL HEROES IN HIS NEXT TRUE STORY, THE 15:17 TO PARIS(Photo by Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros.)Five of Clint Eastwood’s last six films as director have all been based on true stories: Invictus, J. Edgar, Jersey Boys, American Sniper, and last year’s Sully. In April, we learned that he’ll be doing another,&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the very recent past. The 15:17 to Paris will depict the August, 2015 thwarting of an attempt by an ISIS terrorist to kill hundreds of people aboard a train from Brussels to Paris. The casting of the three heroes is unusual, however, because Eastwood is going with&nbsp;non-actors Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, and Spencer Stone — the actual heroes from the incident. Younger actors will play them as children, and in those sections, Tony Hale (Arrested Development) will be&nbsp;their gym teacher, while Thomas Lennon (Reno 911) will play their principal. Judy Greer and Jenna Fischer will also co-star&nbsp;in The 15:17 to Paris.3.&nbsp;MOONLIGHT DIRECTOR KNOWS IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK(Photo by IFC Films courtesy Everett Collection)Although he didn’t win the Academy Award this year for Best Director, Barry Jenkins’ second feature film Moonlight did win the Best Picture prize in strikingly unusual fashion. The directors of Best Picture winners frequently announce new projects within weeks (or even days)&nbsp;of the Oscars, but it’s taken Jenkins four months. Jenkins will next direct an adaptation of the novel If Beale Street Could Talk by author James Baldwin, who&nbsp;was recently the subject of the documentary&nbsp;I Am Not Your Negro, which was itself nominated for a Best Documentary Academy Award. Barry Jenkins will start filming the drama in October, which centers on&nbsp;“a newly engaged Harlem woman who races against the clock to prove her lover’s innocence while carrying their first-born child.” Jenkins is also writing and directing a drama series for Amazon about The Underground Railroad.4. GOOSEBUMPS AUTHOR R.L. STINE CAN TELL YOU HOW TO GET TO FEAR STREET(Photo by Hopper Stone/Columbia Pictures)Some writers are more prolific than others.&nbsp;And then, there’s&nbsp;R.L. Stine, the children’s author who has written hundreds of novels, representing several franchises. Following up on the success&nbsp;of Goosebumps, his most popular series, Stine also wrote a series for teen readers called Fear Street. Likewise, after the box office and &nbsp;critical success of 2015’s Certified Fresh&nbsp;Goosebumps, R.L. Stine has landed a movie deal for Fear Street, too. 20th Century Fox is taking something of an unusual approach with Fear Street, as the studio has made a deal with director Leigh Janiak to direct three movies, which&nbsp;might be filmed back-to-back, and then released back-to-back as well, each separated by just a month. Janiak’s first feature film as director was the 2014 horror film&nbsp;Honeymoon, which only earned just under&nbsp;$10,000 during its domestic run.5. BLAKE LIVELY LEADS SPY MOVIE THE RHYTHM SECTION VIA THE JAMES BOND PRODUCERS…(Photo by Diyah Pera/Lionsgate)We are still waiting to hear something concrete about the future of the James Bond franchise (by which, we mean something more concrete than this). We did, however, hear this week about a new spy franchise that Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson are now working on. The spy thriller is called The Rhythm Section, and it’s based on the first novel in British author Mark Burnell’s series of four (thus far) novels about a spy named Stephanie Patrick. We can also report that Blake Lively (The Shallows) is attached to star as Stephanie Patrick (and presumably in future films). In The Rhythm Section, Lively’s spy heroine will be on a “a path to self-destruction after the death of her family in an airplane crash — a flight that she was meant to be on. After discovering that the crash wasn’t an accident, her anger awakens a new sense of purpose as she becomes an assassin to track down those responsible.” The Rhythm Section will be directed by Reed Morano&nbsp;(2015’s Meadowland), who also worked on Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4. …AND MR. BLAKE LIVELY (AKA RYAN REYNOLDS) MIGHT STAR IN RAINBOW SIX SPY FRANCHISE(Photo by Hilary Bronwyn Gale/Focus Features)This summer marked the 20th anniversary of the release of 1997’s Batman and Robin, and if you’re old enough, you might recall that a lot of&nbsp;fans held&nbsp;that movie&nbsp;against its screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman (here’s an example, circa 2006). In the years since, Goldsman has worked on some Fresh movies (I Am Legend, Cinderella Man, A Beautiful Mind), but the majority of his credits remain Rotten on the Tomatometer. That said, Goldsman just landed a new deal with&nbsp;Paramount this week, with three high profile films all under his aegis now. One of them is the Tom Clancy franchise Rainbow Six, with Ryan Reynolds already in loose negotiations to play former Navy SEAL John Clark. Goldsman will also work on the YA franchise Ologies, which includes such books as Alienology, Dragonology, Illusionology, Monsterology, and Vampireology. Finally, he’s also working on another comic book adaptation, Avengelyne, the 1990s supernatural heroine&nbsp;created by Rob Liefeld.3.&nbsp;BABY DRIVER STAR LILY JAMES CAST AS THE YOUNG MERYL STREEP IN MAMMA MIA: HERE WE GO AGAIN!(Photo by Jonathan Olley/Walt Disney Studios)Hot off the critical and commercial success of Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver, co-star Lily James has secured a spot as the first new cast member to join Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. As the headline above indicates, James will be playing the younger version of Meryl Streep’s character in flashback sequences, as the sequel “goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present.” The sequel is expected to include many of the ABBA songs that were not featured in the first film. Universal Pictures has scheduled Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again! for release on July 20th, 2018 (up against the cyborg action movie Alita: Battle Angel). The original Mamma Mia! earned a Rotten Tomatometer score of 54 percent.2.&nbsp;SUICIDE SQUAD SEQUEL STILL HAPPENING, APPARENTLY(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)While Wonder Woman has enjoyed success across the board this summer, neither of last year’s DCEU movies&nbsp;— Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&nbsp;(27 percent) and&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;(25 percent) — did well on the Tomatometer.&nbsp;And yet, Warner Bros is still moving forward with a Suicide Squad sequel, at least according to news that director Jamue Collet-Serra is the frontrunner for the job. Unfortunately, his record with the Tomatometer isn’t super encouraging either;&nbsp;Run All Night and The Shallows are the only two Fresh films to his name. This wasn’t a great week for the director of the first Suicide Squad, David Ayer, either, as Universal Pictures has “parted ways” with Ayer over their reboot of Scarface, reportedly because his version&nbsp;was “too dark.” That’s right, David Ayer’s screenplay was too dark for a franchise that most recently ended with Al Pacino being shot over 100 times in a blaze of glory near a massive pile of cocaine. To paraphrase Anchorman, “that’s… pretty dark.”1.&nbsp;THE AMITYVILLE HORROR TO RECEIVE A PREQUEL SET IN 1974(Photo by American International courtesy Everett Collection)We&nbsp;first saw a trailer for Amityville: The Awakening, the nineteenth (!) Amityville Horror movie, back in 2014, but after years of delays, the film was recently yanked from its June 30, 2017 release date, and now we have no idea when we’ll&nbsp;eventually see that movie. Instead, the new focus appears to be on something new:&nbsp;Eli Roth will be producing a related film called 1974, for Broad Green Pictures, the company that released Bad Santa 2 (23 percent) and this week’s Wish Upon (21 percent). The film gets its title 1974 from the year that convicted murderer Ronald DeFeo Jr.&nbsp;committed the crimes that inspired the book The Amityville Horror (he murdered the family in the infamous house at 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville, NY).&nbsp;1974 was written and will be directed by Casey La Scala,&nbsp;who also produced (the not-yet-seen) Amityville: The Awakening.&nbsp;1974 is the “Rotten Idea of the Week” because, well, have you ever looked up Amityville on Rotten Tomatoes?","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"new, Opinion, story, Reviews, winner, American, Set, composers, cancelled, TLC, 2017","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/14113325/Quentin-Tarantino-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"quentin-tarantino-takes-on-a-charles-manson-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509187596657","title":"Disney Princesses Will Appear in Wreck-It Ralph 2, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Disney Princesses Will Appear in Wreck-It Ralph 2, and More NewsIncredibles 2 plot details, Mama director tackles Robotech, Sandra Bullock joins a Netflix thriller, and John Lasseter exits Toy Story 4.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 20, 2017 |  CommentsEvery other year in July, there are two big conventions that take place within a short span of time&nbsp;(Disney’s D23 and San Diego Comic-Con), so this week, we’re publishing in two parts, starting off with some of the stories we’ve heard since Friday from D23 (and elsewhere). These stories include news about Disney’s live-action&nbsp;Aladdin, The Incredibles 2, Toy Story 4, and Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2.This WEEK’S TOP STORYDISNEY PRINCESSES TO UNITE IN RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET: WRECK-IT RALPH 2(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)This past weekend at D23, Disney revealed concrete details about&nbsp;Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2. This time around, Ralph will&nbsp;travel into the internet, where his adventures will take him to the websites for popular Disney franchises, including Marvel and Star Wars, but more surprisingly, Ralph will meet up with many of the Disney princesses, who will come together for the first time in a feature film. To make the announcement, Disney trotted out the voice actors behind the characters, including Kristen Bell (Anna from&nbsp;Frozen),&nbsp;Jodi Benson (Ariel in The Little Mermaid), Auli‘i Cravalho (Moana), and Paige O’Hara (Belle from Beauty and the Beast), to name a few. Finally, Taraji P. Henson (Hidden Figures) has also joined the cast for the sequel as an Internet expert named Yesss.Fresh Developments1. WALT DISNEY PICTURES REVEALS THEIR 2018-2019 SCHEDULE AT D23(Photo by Marvel Studios)You’ll notice that this first half of our “Convention Week” coverage features a lot of news from Disney, but their complete presentation also deserves some attention. Disney presented their schedule for the rest of 2017, 2018 and 2019 as a complete package, and while most all of the expected Marvel, Pixar, and Disney films are listed, it’s worth noting that&nbsp;the live-action versions of Aladdin and Christopher Robin (AKA the Winnie the Pooh movie) are not on the schedule (and you can browse this piece to see their other live-action projects).2.&nbsp;THE INCREDIBLES 2 TO START WHERE THE INCREDIBLES ENDED, AND FOCUS ON ELASTIGIRL(Photo by Walt Disney Studios courtesy Everett Collection)After years of 13 years of anticipation, The Incredibles 2 is now less than a year away (6/15/18). We haven’t yet seen a trailer, but Pixar revealed a few new details at D23 this weekend. The most surprising revelation might be that The Incredibles 2 will not be set 14 years later, but will instead begin “right as the first one finishes… only a minute [will have passed].” From there, the sequel will focus on a solo adventure for Holly Hunter’s Elastigirl, while Craig T. Nelson’s Mr. Incredible will be “stuck at home watching Jack Jack.” The Incredibles 2 is scheduled for June 15, 2018.3. PIXAR RETURNS TO FANTASY AND THE SUBURBS… IN THE SAME MOVIE(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Pixar also revealed&nbsp;that they are working on an untitled “suburban fantasy,” which&nbsp;will be set in a world filled with fantasy creatures like elves, trolls, and sprites, but no humans. Within that setting, the movie will tell the story of ” two teenage elf brothers whose father died when they were too young to remember him. But thanks to the little magic still left in the world, the boys embark on a quest that will allow them a chance to spend one last magical day with their father.” We don’t yet know when exactly this film will be released, but Pixar does have the following dates each staked out for something: 3/13/20, 6/19/20, and 6/18/21.4. SANDRA BULLOCK TO STAR IN NETFLIX’S POST-APOCALYPTIC BIRD BOX(Photo by Warner Bros.)Our first non-Disney story this week comes to us from the streaming world, as&nbsp;Netflix has secured&nbsp;Sandra Bullock for its&nbsp;post-apocalyptic thriller called&nbsp;Bird Box, by acclaimed Danish director Susanne Bier (In a Better World, Open Hearts). Based on a 2014 novel by Josh Malerman, Bird Box will tell the story of a mother (Bullock) who must embark&nbsp;on a terrifying 20 mile rowboat journey after Earth has been driven to deadly violence by a mysterious alien force. Netflix will start production on Bird Box next month, and it may be available to stream in either 2019 or 2020.5. MAMA AND IT REMAKE DIRECTOR TO ALSO REBOOT ROBOTECH(Photo by George Kraychyk/Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Next up,&nbsp;Sony Pictures&nbsp;has been developing an adaptation of the popular 1980s anime TV series Robotech on-and-off for several years now, but it came back to life this week when Andy Muschietti stepped in to develop and direct the film. Muschietti is probably currently best known for his feature film debut, 2013’s Mama, but he also has Stephen King’s IT due to arrive on September 8. Muschietti has proven he can handle horror, so it will be interesting to see what he does with Robotech‘s futuristic sci-fi world.6. MENA MASSOUD AND NAOMI SCOTT TO TAKE YOU TO A WHOLE NEW WORLD IN LIVE-ACTION ALADDIN(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)After reports surfaced claiming Disney was having trouble securing leads for its live-action Aladdin, the studio responded by&nbsp;revealing the&nbsp;stars of the film&nbsp;at D23. Naomi Scott, who recently starred in the Power Rangers reboot, will be Disney’s new Princess Jasmine, while Egyptian-Canadian actor Mena Massoud, who has had a few minor roles on TV and film, will play&nbsp;the titular Aladdin. Disney also confirmed that Will Smith will take over for the late Robin Williams as the Genie. Aladdin will be directed by Guy Ritchie (Sherlock Holmes, The Man from U.N.C.L.E.), and due to the delay caused by&nbsp;the extra casting time, the movie is now expected to be released sometime in 2020.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. PIXAR CCO JOHN LASSETER HANDS OFF DIRECTING DUTES ON TOY STORY 4(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Part of the assurance that fans took from&nbsp;Pixar returning to the Toy Story universe for&nbsp;Toy Story 4&nbsp;was that it was going to be directed by one of the studio’s big guns, Chief Creative Officer (CCO) John Lasseter, who also directed the first two&nbsp;Toy Story movies. Unfortunately,&nbsp;Lasseter is now stepping down as co-director of Toy Story 4, and newcomer Josh Cooley (of the short Riley’s First Date) will take over in what will be his feature film debut.&nbsp; Of course, we don’t necessarily know yet that this is a “Rotten Idea,” but we’re certainly disappointed by&nbsp;the departure of one of Pixar’s top talents.2.&nbsp;WRINKLE IN TIME STAR STORM REID AND DAVID OYELOWO TO STAR IN BLUMHOUSE SHOCKER ONLY YOU(Photo by Priscilla Grant, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)One of the biggest trailers to debut this past week was for Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay and starring relative newcomer Storm Reid. This week, Reid signed on to star in the Blumhouse thriller Only You, along with David Oyelowo (who also collaborated with DuVernay on&nbsp;Selma). Though the exact premise is being kept secret, the film&nbsp;involves time travel, a police officer (Oyelowo) whose family was recently killed, and his niece (Reid). Only You will be directed by Jacob Estes (Mean Creek, The Details), whose&nbsp;track record on the Tomatometer sports four Rotten scores&nbsp;and only one Fresh rating.1.

Some&nbsp;interpreted this tease&nbsp;as a preview of a third Planes movie. If that’s the case, the first two Planes movies both received Rotten scores: Planes (23 percent) and Planes: Fire and Rescue (44 percent), so it’s probably best not to get our hopes too high.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Movies, razzies, MCU, Western, animated, New, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/20180711/Wreck-It-Ralph2-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"disney-princesses-will-appear-in-wreck-it-ralph-2-and-more-pre-comic-con-news"},{"id":"47509187557737","title":"Part 2 of IT Already In the Works for 2019, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Part 2 of IT Already In the Works for 2019, and More Movie NewsX-Force and Suicide Squad 2 get directors while Star Wars loses one, Paul Bettany steps in for Han Solo reshoots, and IT's director wants to do vampires next.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 8, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Aladdin, IT 2, Star Wars Episode IX, Suicide Squad 2, Thor: Ragnarok, and X-Force.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHE SECOND HALF OF IT ALREADY IN THE WORKS FOR 2019(Photo by Brooke Palmer/Warner Bros.)If you’ve read Stephen King’s novel IT (or have seen the 1990 IT mini-series), you may remember that the section centered on the kids&nbsp;— the part portrayed in this weekend’s new movie — is only half of the story. In the second half, the Losers Club reunites&nbsp;decades later as adults to take down Pennywise the Clown for good.&nbsp;Armed with a Certified Fresh Tomatometer score of 89%,&nbsp;IT is expected to break box office records this weekend (it’s already Fandango’s top horror pre-seller ever). With that in mind, New Line Cinema is wasting no time in getting IT 2 into theaters as soon as possible&nbsp;(probably in late 2019). One of the first film’s screenwriters, Gary Dauberman (Annabelle: Creation), is signed for the sequel, and IT director Andy Muschietti (Mama) is expected to return as well&nbsp;(though no deal is in place as of this writing). IT was reportedly always loosely planned as two parts.Fresh Developments1. MARVEL’S DEADPOOL 2 SPINOFF TEAM MOVIE X-FORCE LANDS DIRECTOR(Photo by Diyah Pers/Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)We’ve known for a while that the partial reason popular Marvel mutants Cable and Domino are debuting in Deadpool 2 (6/1/18) is that 20th Century Fox&nbsp;plans to spin off the mutant team X-Force&nbsp;into their own movie. X-Force crossed an important threshold this week with the news that Fox has hired Drew Goddard to write and direct the first X-Force movie. Goddard made his directorial debut with 2012’s The Cabin in the Woods, and has also written such movies as Cloverfield, World War Z, and The Martian. Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz will be playing Cable and Domino, respectively.2. GAL GADOT REVEALS THAT SHE ALMOST STARRED AS FURIOSA IN MAD MAX: FURY ROAD(Photo by Warner Bros.)It’s always fun to imagine&nbsp;what movies will be like, and “what might have been.” We don’t often get much insight into the latter&nbsp;after the fact, but that’s exactly what happened this week for 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road. While discussing the winding, twisting road to led to Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot revealed that she almost starred&nbsp;in George Miller’s film as Furiosa, the role that eventually went to Charlize Theron instead. Gadot’s reason for not taking Mad Max appears to have been due to the time she’d have to spend away from her family in Israel (as the movie&nbsp;filmed for several months in Australia and Namibia). Gal Gadot next plays Wonder Woman in Justice League (11/17/17).3.&nbsp;THOR: RAGNAROK&nbsp;BEATS OUT&nbsp;JUSTICE LEAGUE&nbsp;AS THE FALL’S MOST ANTICIPATED FILM(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)A&nbsp;year ago, most fans would have likely predicted that the fall season (September to November) would&nbsp;be won by the DC Comics adventure&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;(11/17/17), even after considering the disappointing Tomatometer scores for 2016’s&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&nbsp;and&nbsp;Suicide Squad. Ever since Marvel Studios revealed the first teasers and trailers for&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;(featuring The Hulk), though, the fan fervor has decidedly tipped in their direction. Movie ticketing site Fandango ran an anticipationg survey for the next three months, and&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;(11/3/17)&nbsp;came out on top, also beating out the sequels&nbsp;Blade Runner 2049&nbsp;and&nbsp;A Bad Moms Christmas, and Pixar’s&nbsp;Coco. The poll did not stretch past Thanksgiving, so it did not include such December movies as&nbsp;Pitch Perfect 3,&nbsp;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, and&nbsp;Star Wars: The Last Jedi.4.&nbsp;IT DIRECTOR MAY TELL VAMPIRE PREQUEL STORY DRACUL(Photo by Brooke Palmer/Warner Bros.)Although New Line Cinema is hoping Andy Muschietti (IT, Mama) will return to direct IT 2 in time for a 2019 release, other studios are also looking to recruit&nbsp;Muschietti for their own horror films. Paramount Pictures, at least, seems to have&nbsp;exactly that in mind. The studio&nbsp;has made a deal with the estate of Bram Stoker, author of Dracula,&nbsp;for a prequel called Dracul, which would tell the story of the young author in 1868, and his encounter with “an ungodly evil that he traps in an ancient tower all the while scribbling the events that led him there.” Paramount hopes to attract Andy Muschietti’s interest in directing Dracul “somewhere down the line.”5. MARVEL’S VISION PAUL BETTANY JOINS THE HAN SOLO PREQUEL DURING RESHOOTS(Photo by Peter Mountain/Warner Bros.)Recently, news broke that Michael K. Williams (HBO’s The Wire) had dropped out of playing a “human/animal hybrid” in the Han Solo prequel (5/25/18) because scheduling conflicts prevented him&nbsp;from participating in director Ron Howard’s reshoots. Not to confuse coincidence with correlation, but this week, Paul Bettany joined the prequel for the aforementioned reshoots. It’s not known who Bettany will be playing or if&nbsp;he&nbsp;is replacing Michael K. Williams. He&nbsp;does have experience with roles requiring heavy use of motion-capture performances, however, having played the Vision in Marvel’s Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War.6. JONATHAN PRYCE AND ANTHONY HOPKINS TO SHARE THE TITLE ROLE OF THE POPE(Photo by Ricardo Vaz Palma/Sony Pictures Classics, Blake Tyers/Lionsgate)The 2013 ascendancy of Pope Francis while the previous Pope Benedict XVI was still living was a historically rare event (he was also the first Jesuit and the first from the Southern Hemisphere). As such, it shouldn’t be surprising that someone would eventually want to make a movie out of it, and that someone is Netflix. The film&nbsp;will be called The Pope, and it will be directed by Fernando Meirelles (City of God, The Constant Gardener). Jonathan Pryce (who played religious leader High Sparrow on Game of Thrones) will play Pope Francis, and Sir Anthony Hopkins will play Pope Benedict XVI.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. CASTING NEWS SPARKS NEW CONTROVERSY FOR DISNEY’S LIVE ACTION ALADDIN(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)When Disney first announced an ambitious casting call earlier this year for their live action remake of Aladdin, the focus was on diversity, as Disney aimed to cast Middle Eastern actors as both Aladdin and Jasmine. British actress Naomi Scott (Power Rangers) was eventually cast as Jasmine, and Will Smith is playing the Genie, but most of the rest of the cast are indeed of Middle Eastern descent. Many fans were shocked this week when it was announced that a new character named Prince Anders (a “suitor from Skanland”) would be introduced&nbsp;and&nbsp;played by Billy Magnussen (of TV’s Get Shorty), who is not Middle Eastern. You can see some of the social media reactions here.2.&nbsp;JURASSIC WORLD DIRECTOR NO LONGER WORKING ON STAR WARS EPISODE IX(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Universal Pictures)Although much news is made of the various director shakeups at Warner Bros over their DC Comics adaptations, one of Marvel’s corporate cousins, Lucasfilm, has had its share of directorial hiccups recently. Some have also criticized the Star Wars company (and others) for hiring only young male directors with just one or two indie credits for their much bigger budget movies. One such example was Colin Treverrow, who landed Jurassic World on the strength of his debut film, Safety Not Guaranteed, and then landed&nbsp;the directing gig on Star Wars Episode IX (5/24/19). That was until this Tuesday, when Disney issued an announcement that the studio is parting ways with Trevorrow on Star Wars Episode IX. A new director hasn’t been announced yet, but Rian Johnson (Star Wars: The Last Jedi) is reportedly at the top of Disney’s shortlist. When asked if he might direct Episode IX, Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi replied, “Lolz. I like to complete my films.”1.&nbsp;THE ACCOUNTANT DIRECTOR JOINS SUICIDE SQUAD 2(Photo by Todd Williamson/Getty Images)Director and screenwriter Gavin O’Connor is perhaps best known for his Certified Fresh 2011 film Warrior, but a deeper look at his Tomatometer shows in the last 12 years, it’s his only Fresh score. So, the argument could be made that Gavin O’Connor needs to release another Fresh film in the near future, and a sequel to a film that became notorious for its 25% Rotten score&nbsp;might not be the best idea. That, however, is exactly what Gavin O’Connor is doing, as he is now signed to write and direct the DC Comics sequel to 2016’s Suicide Squad. Despite its low&nbsp;Tomatometer score, Suicide Squad was a $745 million international box office hit, so Warner Bros hopes to make this sequel their second DC Comics project to start filming in 2018, after Shazam (starring Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Shondaland","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/08194405/It-2017-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"part-2-of-it-already-in-the-works-for-2019-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509187573100","title":"Disney Announces Obi-Wan Kenobi Spinoff, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Disney Announces Obi-Wan Kenobi Spinoff, and More Movie NewsPatty Jenkins scores a big payday, Leonardo DiCaprio will play his namesake, Tom Cruise breaks his ankle, and Deadpool 2 suffers a tragic loss.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 18, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news, including stories about&nbsp;Leonardo Da Vinci, Son of Shaft, Sunset Boulevard, and Wonder Woman 2.This WEEK’S TOP STORYLUCASFILM OFFICIALLY DEVELOPING STAR WARS SPINOFF ABOUT OBI-WAN KENOBI(Photo by Lucasfilm)In early 2013, a few months after Disney acquired Lucasfilm, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced plans for Star Wars spinoff movies that eventually became last year’s Rogue One and next year’s Han Solo (5/25/18). In the years since, there have also been rumors about other spinoffs for&nbsp;characters like Boba Fett, Yoda, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. We can now report that the Obi-Wan Kenobi spinoff is indeed officially in development, with Academy Award nominated director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot, The Hours, and the upcoming Wicked movie)&nbsp;in talks for the job. No other details are known, but when asked in the past about the Obi-Wan spinoff, Ewan McGregor has said, “I’d very much like to do one too.”Fresh Developments1. DIRECTOR PATTY JENKINS RECEIVES BIG PAYDAY FOR WONDER WOMAN SEQUEL(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)Wonder Woman has now earned over $800 million globally (and it hasn’t even opened in some regions yet, like Japan). As such, it’s long been expected that Warner Bros would make whatever deal they needed to ensure&nbsp;that film’s director, Patty Jenkins, would return for Wonder Woman 2 (12/13/19). And now we know the studio is doing exactly that, as Patty Jenkins is now in final negotiations to be the highest paid female director of all time. Exact numbers have been withheld, but the speculation is that Jenkins’ new payday is “in line with any other director who has performed at this level.” Presumably, that’s a reference&nbsp;to someone like Zack Snyder, who made $10 million plus a “10% cash break” for directing&nbsp;Man of Steel.2. GLENN CLOSE TO STAR IN MUSICAL REMAKE OF SUNSET BOULEVARDIn 1967, Mel Brooks directed The Producers, which became a hit stage musical in 2001, and then that was adapted as musical film in 2005. Today’s news is similar.&nbsp;Sunset Boulevard began as an acclaimed 1950 film, which was then adapted by Andrew Lloyd Webber as a musical in 1991, and now that will be adapted as a big screen movie musical as well. Paramount Pictures is in talks with Glenn Close, who starred as aging star Norma Desmond in both 1994 and the recent revival, and the studio is also looking&nbsp;for the male lead and a director, with filming expected to start in January, 2018.3. NEW THOR: RAGNAROK&nbsp;TRAILER FEATURES&nbsp;DOCTOR STRANGE(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)The first trailer for this November’s Thor: Ragnarok (11/3/17) climaxed with Thor reuniting humorously with his “friend from work,” The Incredible Hulk. The second trailer, which premiered at San Diego Comic Con, added Thor’s brother Loki to the mix, as they used Ghostbusters­-style weapons side by side.&nbsp; This week, in a new Japanese trailer, Benedict Cumberbatch joins Thor’s magical super team as Doctor Strange. Of course, Doctor Strange’s participation in Thor: Ragnarok had already been teased last year in the Doctor Strange mid-credits scene.4. RON HOWARD TEASES THE RETURN OF THE EMPIRE IN THE HAN SOLO PREQUEL(Photo by Ron Howard)Director Ron Howard (Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind) is continuing filming of next year’s untitled Han Solo prequel (5/25/18), after taking over for the directors of The LEGO Movie. We still don’t know the prequel’s premise, but this week, Ron Howard teased an image of one of the black Imperial helmets from Star Wars, with the caption, “The Empire Looms Large.” Some writers are speculating that this could tease a return of the Death Star, while others note that other non-Death-Star Imperial soldiers may also wear the same helmets.5. EMMA STONE PASSES JENNIFER LAWRENCE AS THE YEAR’S HIGHEST PAID ACTRESS(Photo by Sabrina Lantos/Sony Classics)Until this week, Jennifer Lawrence spent two years (2015 and 2016) as Hollywood’s highest paid actress, but this week, a new actress took the top spot, with Lawrence dropping to #3. With an income of over $26 million, Emma Stone is 2017’s highest paid actress, with perennial favorite Jennifer Aniston coming in at #2. The other actresses in the top ten are: Melissa McCarthy, Mila Kunis, Charlize Theron, Emma Watson, Cate Blanchett, Julia Roberts, and Amy Adams. Emma Stone’s next film is the Billie Jean King biopic Battle of the Sexes (9/22/17).6. LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO PLAY HIS NAMESAKE IN A LEONARDO DA VINCI BIOPIC(Photo by Mary Cybulski/Paramount Pictures)As the story goes, Leonardo DiCaprio’s mother was looking at artwork by Leonardo Da Vinci when her baby first “kicked,” so that’s why she named him “Leonardo.” Paramount Pictures won a bidding war this week for the rights to Steve Jobs author Walter Isaacson’s upcoming biography of Leonardo Da Vinci (10/17/17). The project is being developed as a star&nbsp;vehicle for DiCaprio to play the genius artist and inventor, and also produce via his Appian Way company. Leonardo DiCaprio is also attached to star in biopics about record producer Sam Phillips and prolific serial killer H.H. Holmes.7. DANIEL CRAIG DOUBLE-CONFIRMS HE’S RETURNING FOR THE 25TH JAMES BOND(Photo by Francois Duhamel/Columbia Pictures)Three weeks ago, The New York Times reported a confirmation that Daniel Craig would be returning for the 25th official James Bond movie (11/8/19). Talking to a Boston radio station early this week, however, Daniel Craig seemed to equivocate on&nbsp;whether he was definitively signed to return. Well, that didn’t last long, as Craig quickly took to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&nbsp;to confirm that yes, indeed, he is returning as James Bond for the November, 2019 film.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. THE SHAFT FRANCHISE CONTINUES WITH SON OF SHAFTIn the 2000 “remake” of Shaft, Samuel L. Jackson played the nephew of Richard Roundtree’s original 1970s detective, making it a sequel. Now, New Line Cinema is preparing to expand the family tree for a fifth film to be called Son of Shaft, in which Jessie T. Usher (TV’s Survivor’s Remorse) will play the son of Jackson’s character. It’s unclear if Usher will play a police or private detective, but both Jackson and Roundtree are in talks to reprise their characters.&nbsp;Son of Shaft will be directed by Tim Story (Fantastic Four, Ride Along 2), whose has seven Rotten films as director&nbsp;and only three Fresh ones (two of which are Kevin Hart concert movies).2. TOM CRUISE BREAKS AN ANKLE DOING STUNTS&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 6(Photo by Industrial Light &amp; Magic/Paramount Pictures)This week, two unrelated action movies both had accidents involving stuntwork during filming, resulting in a major injury on one, and a death on the other. Though coincidental, the timing highlights the dangers involved in producing some of our biggest movies. Tom Cruise is famous for his willingness to do dangerous stunts (like hanging from skyscrapers and flying planes), but this week, he&nbsp;broke an ankle while performing a long jump between two buildings, which you can see happen right here. Filming of Mission: Impossible 6 may now be delayed by nine weeks, and wrap up in December instead, with still enough time to be released on July 27, 2018.1. MOTORCYLE RACER DIES ON THE SET OF DEADPOOL 2(Photo by Joe Lederer/20th Century Fox)Tom Cruise’s ankle will hopefully heal with time, but the week’s other stunt-related accident resulted in an on-set death. Joi “SJ” Harris, “the female African-American road racer,” died following a motorcycle stunt&nbsp;for Deadpool 2 that sent her vehicle crashing through the glass doors of Vancouver’s Shaw Tower. Josh Brolin, who is playing Cable in the sequel, voiced his condolences,&nbsp;as did Ryan Reynolds, who said, “We’re heartbroken,” and the director and studio. The stuntperson community is likewise mourning the tragedy, and continues to discuss how such deaths can be prevented in the future.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"godzilla, 45, Sundance, in, finale","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/18143732/Obi-Wan-Movie-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"disney-announces-obi-wan-kenobi-spinoff-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509187588464","title":"Comic-Con Ketchup: Ready Player One‘s Easter Egg-Filled Trailer and Lots of Superhero Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Comic-Con Ketchup: Ready Player One's Easter Egg-Filled Trailer and Lots of Superhero Movie NewsCaptain Marvel is set in the 1990s, the Flash solo movie gets a meaningful title, and Hulk 3 will never happen... though Spawn 2 will.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 24, 2017 |  CommentsThis special edition of the Weekly Ketchup covers all the big stories that came out of this past weekend’s San Diego Comic-Con and includes news&nbsp;about superhero movies like Ant-Man and the Wasp, Captain Marvel, Justice League, Shazam!, and Spawn.This WEEK’S TOP STORYSTEVEN SPIELBERG’S EASTER EGGY READY PLAYER ONE TRAILER DEBUTSIn a Saturday at San Diego Comic Con bursting with trailers, Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Ready Player One (3/30/18) may have been the one that set social media on fire the most. Fans of Ernest Cline’s novel probably weren’t surprised by the trailer’s many 1980s/1990s pop culture references. There was, however, glee to be found in spotting them all. We don’t want to spoil too many, but we spotted: The Iron Giant, Freddy Krueger, Christine, as well as vehicles from Akira, Back to the Future, and Mad Max, among others.Fresh Developments1. BRIE LARSON’S CAPTAIN MARVEL TO BE SET IN THE 1990S (AND INTRODUCE THE SKRULLS)(Photo by Marvel Studios)As if there wasn’t enough nostalgia in Ready Player One, Marvel Studios also announced one of their upcoming films would be set in the 1990s — and it’s one&nbsp;we already knew about.&nbsp;Captain Marvel (3/8/19), starring Brie Larson, will be set&nbsp;at least 18 years before 2008’s Iron Man, and will also introduce the shapeshifting alien race, the Skrulls (you can get a tease of them right here). Samuel L. Jackson will reprise his role as S.H.I.E.L.D. superspy Nick Fury, and he’ll still have both of his eyes, which opened up a world of new questions about the setting.2. SPEAKING OF CAPTAIN MARVEL, DC’S SHAZAM! WILL BE NEXT AFTER AQUAMAN(Photo by Jeff Daly courtesy of HBO)New Line Cinema has announced that Shazam!&nbsp;— also known as “Captain Marvel” but not to be confused with Marvel’s own Captain Marvel — will be the next DC Comics movie to start filming, in early 2018, after Warner Bros’ Aquaman (12/21/18), which suggests a possible release date in 2019 (the same year as Marvel’s&nbsp;Captain Marvel). Dwayne Johnson is attached to star in Shazam!, but we don’t yet know who will play young Billy Batson or his titular superhero alter ego, and the film will be directed by David F. Sandberg (Lights Out, next month’s Annabelle: Creation).3. MORPHEUS AND CATWOMAN JOIN MARVEL’S ANT-MAN AND THE WASP(Photo by Claudette Barius/Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Ever since 2015’s Ant-Man, there have been rumors about who might play the first Wasp, Janet Van Dyne (Sharon Stone&nbsp;and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both of whom have obvious Michael Douglas ties, were mentioned). As it turns out, it’ll be former&nbsp;Catwoman Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns) who will co-star in Ant-Man and the Wasp (7/6/18), and she will be joined by Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix) as Bill Foster, who in the comics was also the size-shifting superhero Black Goliath. Hannah John-Kamen&nbsp;(Ready Player One) has also been cast as a female version of the corporate espionage villain&nbsp;The Ghost.4. NEW JUSTICE LEAGUE TRAILER DEBUTS… BUT WHO’S ALFRED TALKING TO?(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)By all reports, Joss Whedon is still working on reshoots of this November’s Justice League, after Zack Snyder’s departure due to a family tragedy. Even so, the new Justice League trailer already seems to showcase Whedon’s influence, including more focus on Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, and levity from Cyborg and the Flash. The ending does tease us with a question, though, which is: who is Jeremy Irons’ Alfred talking to?&nbsp;Superman would seem an obvious answer (since we know Henry Cavill is in the movie), but what if we’re in for a surprise?5. THE SOLO FLASH MOVIE&nbsp;TITLE IS&nbsp;FLASHPOINT, WHICH COULD BE A BIG DEAL(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)We don’t have a release date for DC’s solo Flash movie yet, but DCEU guiding hand Geoff Johns revealed something big at SDCC. The Flash movie will be based on the popular “Flashpoint” storyline&nbsp;from the&nbsp;comics, which paved the way for a total continuity revamp. Fans of the CW TV series are also familiar with Flashpoint, because it was a key part of season 3.&nbsp;Flashpoint may give WB and DC a convenient way of solving inevitable casting problems, but it’s also great for retelling stories or revamping characters.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4. RUMOR OF THE WEEK: BEN AFFLECK’S FUTURE AS THE BATMAN(Photo by Zack Snyder/Warner Bros.)Although the blame isn’t necessarily on him, the two movies last year featuring Ben Affleck as Batman both received Rotten Tomatometer scores: 27 percent for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and 25 percent for Suicide Squad.&nbsp;That might be partly why there was a report this week&nbsp;that Warner Bros. is considering options to ease another actor into the role of Batman, post-Affleck. However, the reason we call this a “rumor” is that Affleck himself seemed to deny it.3. MARK RUFFALO CONFIRMS HULK 3 “WILL NEVER HAPPEN”(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)One of the most dazzling trailers to debut at SDCC was for Marvel’s Thor: Ragnarok, which, among other things, showcased Mark Ruffalo’s return as Hulk (including actual dialogue from the Green Goliath). Enjoy that good news, because Ruffalo also burst many fans’ bubbles this week, saying, “I want to just make one thing perfectly clear today: A standalone ‘Hulk’ [AKA Hulk 3] movie will never happen… … Universal has the rights, and for some reason, they don’t know how to play well with Marvel. And they don’t want to make money.”2. MEMORABLY AWFUL SPAWN TO BE REBOOTED FOR JUST $12 MILLIONOn August 1st, 2017, the world will “celebrate” the 20th anniversary of the Spawn movie, based on Todd McFarlane’s popular demonic anti-hero. That movie’s Rotten Tomatometer score of just 18 percent might also be why New Line Cinema never greenlit a Spawn 2. After over a decade&nbsp;spent trying to get a sequel made, McFarlane announced this week that horror production company Blumhouse put up a budget in the $10-$12 million range for a new Spawn movie. The new R-rated Spawn is going to be made for just a fraction&nbsp;of the $58 million&nbsp;Fox spent on last year’s Deadpool, which was hailed as a modestly budgeted success.1. THREE-TIME ROTTEN MOVIE VILLAIN DOCTOR DOOM TO GET HIS OWN(Photo by 20th Century Fox)The world has now had three Fantastic Four movies with Marvel’s Doctor Doom as the villain, and all three were Rotten: 29 percent in 1994, 27 percent in 2005, and 9 percent in 2015. And yet, 20th Century Fox is now planning a fourth movie, this time focusing on just Doom&nbsp;himself. At a panel for his&nbsp;FX series&nbsp;Legion, creator Noah Hawley teased a movie for 20th Century Fox thusly: “Two words: Doctor. Doom.” There are also rumors that 20th Century Fox might reboot Fantastic Four with only half of the traditional team: The Thing, Human Torch, and Reed and Sue’s kids.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"New, razzies, movies, service, worst, robots, 2019, Vudu, unscripted, Opinion, Moore, high, hollywood, Rey","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24155850/Ready-Player-One-SDCC-Trailer.jpg","slug":"comic-con-ketchup-ready-player-ones-easter-egg-filled-trailer-and-lots-of-superhero-movie-news"},{"id":"47509188753783","title":"Wonder Woman Sequel Details Emerge, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Wonder Woman Sequel Details Emerge, and More Movie NewsAn open casting call for Fantastic Beasts 2, some Top Gun sequel details, impressive cast additions to a Spielberg film, and a new Melissa McCarthy comedy make the list.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 9, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 2, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, Top Gun: Maverick, and new roles for Michael B. Jordan and Melissa McCarthy.This WEEK’S TOP STORYWONDER WOMAN 2: WHAT WE LEARNED THIS WEEK ABOUT THE SEQUELRyan FujitaniThis week, as fans of all types celebrated the record-breaking $103 million opening weekend of Wonder Woman, details about Warner Bros’ plans for a sequel remained ambiguous. Although initially signed for just three movies, Gal Gadot has reportedly extended her&nbsp;contract to play Wonder Woman beyond that. But the bigger question mark concerns director Patty Jenkins, who was apparently only signed to direct one Wonder Woman movie, but seems interested in returning —&nbsp;she already talked this week about her ideas, which would focus on the Amazonian’s adventures in the United States. It was also confirmed this week that two of Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman co-stars will be joining her in this November’s Justice League, as both Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen are expected to return as General Antiope and Queen Hippolyta (note: that article has Wonder Woman spoilers!). Finally, in other Wonder Woman&nbsp;news, the teaser trailer debuted&nbsp;for Professor Marston &amp; The Wonder Woman, which stars Luke Evans as the writer and psychiatrist who created Wonder Woman.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;FANTASTIC BEASTS SEQUEL CASTING CALL FOR TEEN NEWT, DUMBLEDORE AND MORE(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Most of the Weekly Ketchup‘s casting announcements tend to involve well-known&nbsp;actors and actresses, but we also like to feature open casting calls, because you never know when they might turn up the next big star.&nbsp;In the last several months, Walt Disney Pictures in particular has been doing these (specifically, for their live-action remakes of Aladdin and Mulan), but this week, Warner Bros followed suit. The movie in question is Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 2 (11/16/18), and a few of the characters are very, very popular. Warner Bros has announced an open casting&nbsp;call&nbsp;for actors between the ages of 13 and 16 for young versions of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz), and a new character named Sebastian. There are also two opportunities for (possibly) slightly older actors, aged 16 to 18, to play the young versions of Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) and Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp). If you or someone you know want to co-star in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 2, you can start by reading the instructions here&nbsp;(and be sure to mention the Weekly Ketchup on the red carpet). Thanks, and good luck!2. ENSEMBLE CAST JOINS TOM HANKS AND MERYL STREEP IN STEVEN SPIELBERG’S PENTAGON PAPERS MOVIE(Photo by Michael K. Short/AMC. Patti Perret/Alchemy)We’ve known for a while now that Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep are co-starring as Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee and publisher Kay Graham, respectively, in Steven Spielberg’s next film, an untitled drama about the Pentagon Papers (and by extension, the Vietnam War). The movie has reportedly been quietly filming at a former AT&amp;T office building near White Plains, NY, but this week, we learned who will be joining Hanks and Streep, and many of them are best known for their work on TV.&nbsp;The impressive list includes Alison Brie (Community), David Cross (Arrested Development), Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul), Sarah Paulson (The People vs O.J. Simpson), Jesse Plemons (Breaking Bad), Michael Stuhlbarg (Boardwalk Empire), and Bradley Whitford (The West Wing). The film&nbsp;is scheduled for release in December, (barely) just in time for awards consideration.3. MICHAEL B. JORDAN TO REUNITE FOR MOVIE #4 WITH BLACK PANTHER DIRECTOR RYAN COOGLER(Photo by Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros.)There are examples of actors and directors who work together frequently, but it’s not until around movie #4 or so that that it becomes a true partnership. One example is the relationship between&nbsp;Michael B. Jordan and director Ryan Coogler, who first worked together on Fruitvale Station, then on the Rocky sequel Creed, and next year, and next year, they also have Marvel’s Black Panther (2/16/18) (in which Jordan plays the villain Killmonger). The fourth movie for the pair&nbsp;will be Wrong Answer, based on the true story of an Atlanta-area middle school that, in 2013, was revealed to have faked test scores to qualify&nbsp;for “No Child Left Behind” funding. The Wrong Answer screenplay will be adapted by Ta-Nehisi Coates, who has recently been writing Black Panther for Marvel Comics. In other Michael B. Jordan news, he will be joined in HBO’s new adaptation of Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 by Sofia Boutella, who is in theaters this week as&nbsp;The Mummy.4. TOM CRUISE REVEALS TOP GUN: MAVERICK DETAILS (THAT ARE NOT REALLY THAT REVEALING)You might be able to say a lot of other things about Tom Cruise, but one of the reasons he continues to attract big money contracts is that he will do anything to promote his new movie, and that includes lots, and lots, and lots of interviews. In a recent interview with Access Hollywood&nbsp;about The Mummy, their intrepid reporter got two new details from Cruise&nbsp;about the long-in-development Top Gun sequel. For one, we now know the title will be&nbsp;Top Gun: Maverick, which refers to the pilot handle of Cruise’s character (Cruise said, “I didn’t want a number, you know what I mean?”). When asked about potential co-stars (like, say, Val Kilmer, or maybe younger stars to play new pilots), Cruise replied, “There’s gonna be jets.” While that may seem obvious, it had been previously reported that the new film would be&nbsp;about drone pilots (and it still might be, to some extent). Production of Top Gun: Maverick is expected to start in the next year, possibly aiming for a release date in 2019.5. ZHANG ZIYI AND BRADLEY WHITFORD JOIN GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics, Mark Schafer/Showtime courtesy Everett Collection)Following successes both for their reboot of Godzilla in 2014 and this year’s Kong: Skull Island, Warner Bros has ambitious plans for their future Godzilla franchise, whose next installment is&nbsp;Godzilla: King of the Monsters (3/22/19). That movie is expected to introduce new monsters Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah (as teased at the end of Kong: Skull Island).&nbsp;Godzilla: King of the Monsters will also introduce several new human characters to be played by recent cast additions Millie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things), Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights), Vera Farmiga (Bates Motel), O’Shea Jackson Jr (Straight Outta Compton), and Thomas Middleditch (Silicon Valley). This week, they were joined by two more names, starting with Bradley Whitford, who is best known for TV’s The West Wing (but who also costarred in the horror films The Cabin in the Woods and Get Out). We don’t know yet anything about Whitford’s character, but the second new cast member this week, Zhang Ziyi (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), did come with some information: she’ll be playing a “significant figure” in Monarch, the secret organization that tracks giant monsters. (Our best guess: Jing Tian played a 1970s Monarch biologist in Kong: Skull Island, so perhaps Zhang Ziyi plays her daughter?) Zhang is also expected to co-star in Godzilla vs Kong&nbsp;when it’s released on May 22, 2020.6. JOEL EDGERTON PRODUCING AND STARRING IN GAY DRAMA BOY ERASED(Photo by Gravitas Ventures courtesy Everett Collection)Actor Joel Edgeton (Loving, Warrior) made his feature film directorial debut in 2015 with the Certified Fresh thriller The Gift, and this week, we learned what his next project will be. Edgerton will direct and co-star in a drama called Boy Erased, adapting a memoir by Garrard Conley about “his harrowing time attending Love in Action, an entity that attempts to deprogram LGBT people.&nbsp;The son of a Baptist pastor in a conservative small Arkansas town, Conley was outed to his parents at age 19.” Garrard Conley will be played by Lucas Hedges, who co-starred as Casey Affleck’s nephew in the recent Amazon Studios Oscar-winner&nbsp;Manchester by the Sea. Edgerton is reportedly courting fellow Australians Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman to play Conley’s parents, but they haven’t officially started negotiations yet.7. JAKE GYLLENHAAL TO STAR IN WORLD WAR II TRUE STORY THE LOST AIRMAN(Photo by Anne Marie Fox/Fox Searchlight courtesy Everett Collection)Netflix may get more of the press, but Amazon Studios has been making a lot of moves as well, and their&nbsp;Manchester by the Sea recently proved&nbsp;they were capable of big screen success (which is arguably something that Netflix still struggles with). The latest movie star to sign on with Amazon Studios is Jake Gyllenhaal, who will produce and star in a movie called The Lost Airman, an adaptation of the Seth Meyerowitz&nbsp;non-fiction book, The Lost Airman: A True Story of Escape From Nazi-Occupied France, about the author’s grandfather, who fought alongside the French Resistance for six months after his B-24 bomber was shot down over France in World War II. Gyllenhaal, who has been particularly busy lately, has several films on the way, including the monster movie Okja, Paul Dano’s directorial debut Wildlife, the Boston Marathon bombing drama Stronger, and the Western The Sisters Brothers, with Joaquin Phoenix. You can read more about The Lost Airman at the book’s official site, right here.8. EVA LONGORIA AND KERRY WASHINGTON CLOCK IN COMEDY 24/7(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough, Dee Cercone / Everett Collection)Sometimes, when a studio reveals details about a movie, it feels&nbsp;like we’re not getting the most pertinent information. Of course, it&nbsp;does make some sense, since studios compete with each other, and they don’t want to give away too much. The early descriptions of Universal’s Get Out&nbsp;come to mind, and&nbsp;we mention that film because Universal Pictures is also the company behind a new “workplace comedy” called 24/7. Aside from its&nbsp;genre, all we know about 24/7&nbsp;is that Universal has attracted the interest of stars Eva Longoria and Kerry Washington, both of whom will produce the comedy. Eva Longoria is currently filming the remake of Overboard (starring Anna Faris and Eugenio Derbez), and Kerry Washington, of course, is the award-winning star of ABC’s hit series Scandal.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1. MELISSA MCCARTHY TO DON SANTA’S JOLLY RED SUIT AS MRS. MARGIE CLAUS(Photo by Hopper Stone/Columbia Pictures)Tim Allen starred in The Santa Clause as Santa’s replacement, which was followed by Vince Vaughn as his brother Fred Claus&nbsp;and the animated film Arthur Christmas, about Santa’s son. Then, there was&nbsp;2004’s Elf, about a human boy (played as an adult by Will Ferrell) adopted by one of Santa’s elves.&nbsp;Elf was produced and released by New Line Cinema, and this week, we learned that New Line is going for another Christmas comedy. Melissa McCarthy will produce, star in, and make her musical debut in&nbsp;a family holiday musical called&nbsp;Margie Claus, which will be directed by her husband Ben Falcone. McCarthy will play&nbsp;Santa’s wife Margie, who, after Santa’s disappearance, is forced to&nbsp;“put together an unlikely rescue team and set off from the North Pole for the first time in decades to rescue Santa and save Christmas.” The two previous Melissa McCarthy movies written and directed by Falcone both received Rotten Tomatometer scores of under 25 percent: Tammy (23 percent) and The Boss (22 percent). New Line has scheduled Margie Claus for release on November 15, 2019. In the meantime, McCarthy will also co-star next year in New Line’s&nbsp;Life of the Party (5/11/2018)… also written and directed by Falcone.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Broadway, Apple, Competition, Alien, Spring, Academy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/09201529/Wonder-Woman-2-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"wonder-woman-sequel-details-emerge-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509207949870","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Paul Rudd Confirmed as Ant-Man","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Paul Rudd Confirmed as Ant-Man\n                        Also, new roles for Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix, and Hugh Jackman, plus a Gilligan's Island movie.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 20, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThe last true entry of the Weekly Ketchup for 2013 covers a fairly slow news week (a fact we remind you of frequently down below). What did still make the news included a lot of comic book movies, like Ant-Man, Sandman, X-Men: Apocalypse, and the Man of Steel sequel. There’s also new potential roles for Brad Pitt and Hugh Jackman, and we might actually be getting… Gilligan’s Island: The Movie?\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nPAUL RUDD TO GET REALLY SMALL ON THE BIG SCREEN AS MARVEL’S ANT-MAN\n\nFirst mentioned as being in contention for the role earlier this year (along with Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Paul Rudd was confirmed this week as starring in Marvel’s second 2015 superhero movie Ant-Man. Although there is some debate about which Ant-Man Paul Rudd will be playing, this report claims to have it confirmed that Rudd will be playing Doctor Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, the one with the most controversial history as a character. (Spoiler alert: Sayid is wearing a visual clue to what we’re talking about in this picture). Regardless of which Ant-Man Rudd will be playing, it’s a pretty strong likelihood that he will be joining the Avengers in the movies at some point, like maybe the third movie in 2018. The next casting question for Ant-Man will be which actress will be cast as Janet Van Dyne, AKA Wasp, who is the other remaining founding member of the team who has not yet been represented in Marvel’s franchise. Ant-Man will be directed by Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World), and released by Marvel Studios on July 31, 2015.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT TO STAR IN AND DIRECT GOTH FAVORITE SANDMAN\n\nThe huge clue we got earlier in the week that Paul Rudd was going to be announced as Ant-Man actually came earlier, when the other actor who had been mentioned was confirmed for a movie over at Marvel’s Distinguished Competition. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is finalizing a deal with Warner Bros to both star in, and direct, the long-in-development adaptation of the Vertigo Comics/DC Comics character Sandman. The character of Morpheus of the Endless was created by British comic book writer Neil Gaiman, revitalizing a character name for DC Comics that had been one of their original Golden Age crimefighters back in the 1940s (Gaiman’s version was very, very different). Joseph Gordon-Levitt made his feature film directing debut in Don Jon earlier this year, which he also starred in. This deal keeps Gordon-Levitt’s comic book adaptation career at Warner Bros, for whom he worked recently in The Dark Knight Rises (directed by Christopher Nolan, for whom JGL also starred in Inception, another Warner Bros film). The next step will be to hire a new screenwriter. Previous writers to attempt an adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s Sandman have included Roger Avary (cowriter of Pulp Fiction), Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise), and Neil Gaiman himself.\n\n\n\t\n#2 BRAD PITT AND TOM CRUISE MAY COSTAR AGAIN IN THE FORD/FERRARI MOVIE GO LIKE HELL\n\nFirst off, it’s worth noting that nothing is official yet, but it’s also a slow news week, and if this happens, it will be a fairly big deal. Brad Pitt is now being “courted” to costar with Tom Cruise for the first time since Interview with the Vampire in 1994 (possibly in time to make the next film a 20th anniversary celebration).  The movie in question is the 20th Century Fox adaptation of the non-fiction book Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans, by A.J. Baime. Tom Cruise is already attached to play car designer Carroll Shelby, and if he signs, Brad Pitt might be playing the other major role, Italian sports car designer Enzo Ferrari.  One reason that Pitt might be likely to sign on is that he actually was attached to star in the movie four years ago, before Cruise ever got involved. Go Like Hell will be directed by Joseph Kosinski (TRON: Legacy), who previously worked with Tom Cruise on this year’s Oblivion.\n\n\n\t\n#3 JOAQUIN PHOENIX IN TALKS TO PLAY A (POSSIBLY FOLLICULARLY CHALLENGED) VILLAIN IN THE MAN OF STEEL SEQUEL\n\nThe same foreword should be applied to this story (not official yet, slow news week, etc) as with the last.  Anyway, “sources” claim that Warner Bros is considering casting Joaquin Phoenix as the main villain in the Man of Steel sequel, who is probably Lex Luthor. Phoenix is currently appearing in the movie Her, which is looking like a very strong Oscar contender for Warner Bros. If he does take the role, and if the role is indeed Lex Luthor, it’s not known if Phoenix would be shaving off all his hair for the role.  Joaquin Phoenix is, after all, better known in recent years for not only having hair, but a lot of it. Warner Bros also hired screenwriter Chris Terrio (Argo) to work on a rewrite for this sequel, which will also famously feature that film’s star and director Ben Affleck (as Batman, you may have heard).\n\n\n\t\n#4 BRYAN SINGER REUNITES WITH THE WRITERS OF X2 FOR X-MEN: APOCALYPSE\n\nScreenwriter news doesn’t always equal huge news, but you know, slow news week, yada yada yada. There’s also the little detail that few screenwriter-related stories inspire the sort of comic book movie fan nostalgia like this one might. Director Bryan Singer posted on Twitter this week that he recently had a “late night X-Men Apocalypse story session with a photograph that included not only X-Men: Days of Future Past writer Simon Kinberg, but also screenwriters Mike Dougherty and Dan Harris. And the reason that could elicit excitement is that they last worked on an X-Men movie for X2, which is still a favorite among fans (arguably equaled only by X-Men: First Class). Anyway, Bryan Singer also posted “It’s snowing in Egypt!”, which was almost certainly a reference to a story idea involving Apocalypse, the evil mutant who himself started as one of the first mutants, back in ancient Egypt (he is very, very old)… and nothing to do with the fact that it actually snowed in Egypt.  20th Century Fox has scheduled X-Men: Apocalypse for May 27, 2016.  X-Men: Days of Future Past opens on May 24, 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#5 HUGH JACKMAN IN TALKS TO PLAY PIRATE VILLAIN BLACKBEARD IN THE (PETER) PAN ORIGIN STORY \n\nSpeaking of X-Men, Hugh Jackman is now in talks to play someone without an adamantium skeleton or claws. The movie is the Peter Pan origin story Pan, the studio is Warner Bros, and the role is the “villainous pirate Blackbeard.” Obviously, we all know that Peter Pan’s pirate villain is more famously Captain Hook, but this movie might predate Hook, or maybe Blackbeard becomes Hook, who knows. Anyway, Pan will be directed by Joe Wright (Hanna, Atonement), and Warner Bros has scheduled the film for June 26, 2015, the same release date as the Seth McFarlane sequel Ted 2.\n\n\n\t\n#6 DISNEY’S ANIMATED MOVIE FOR 2018 REVEALED TO BE ANCIENT HAWAIIAN ADVENTURE MOANA\n\nAs a look at the film release calendar for any point a few years out can give you a hint, animated movies take a long time. That is why this story involves a movie scheduled for 2018. The movie is called Moana, and it is one of the films that Walt Disney Animation Studios is currently developing. As you might guess from the title, the film will be an adventure set 2,000 years ago and will involve the Pacific Ocean and polynesian myths and culture (the lead character’s name is “Moana Waialiki”).  Other movies that Disney has in development for the few years include Marvel’s Japanese superhero adaptation Big Hero 6 (11/7/14) and the comedy Zootopia (3/4/16). One other promising rumor about Moana is that it may be animated in the style used on the short film Paperman.\n\n\n\nRotten Idea of the Week\n\t\n#3 DIVERGENT DIRECTOR NOT RETURNING FOR THE SEQUELS INSURGENT AND ALLEGIANT\n\nOne of the few remaining entries in the recent wave of Young Adult novel franchise adaptations that still has a strong chance of replicating the success of Twilight and The Hunger Games starts with the March 21, 2014 release of Divergent. That movie was directed by Neil Burger (The Illusionist, Limitless), and this week we found out that Neil Burger will not be returning for the two planned sequel adaptations.  Lionsgate has already scheduled release dates for both films: Insurgent (3/20/15) and Allegiant (3/18/16), and you can see a sort of obvious trend with all three release dates. Shailene Woodley is expected to star in all three films based on the books by author Veronica Roth.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE WEINSTEINS REUNITE WITH MIRAMAX, FINALLY, WITH LOTS OF SEQUEL PLANS (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE 2, ANYONE?)\n\nWhen Harvey and Bob Weinstein ran Miramax Films, it seemed almost impossible that the two mogul brothers could ever be separated from their creation. And then, in 2005, it actually happened, and Miramax continued for a few years as a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, and then in 2009, even that started to dwindle down to a mere shadow of Miramax’s former self. Bob and Harvey, meanwhile, pretty much continued doing what they had always done with The Weinstein Company. This week, we learned that a deal has been reached that will bring the Weinsteins and Miramax back together… sort of. Mostly, what the Weinsteins are getting (from “Qatar Holding”) are the rights to make sequels to movies like Rounders and Shakespeare in Love, and TV shows based on properties like Flirting with Disaster and Good Will Hunting. Good things might come out of this; who knows? This is still, however, a Rotten Idea, because we already knows what happens when you make Good Will Hunting 2.\n\n\n\t\n#1 JOSH GAD TO WRITE AND STAR IN THE LONG-IN-DEVELOPMENT GILLIGAN’S ISLAND MOVIE\n\nThis has been a difficult year for Warner Bros, which lost this year their very productive deal with Legendary Pictures, when that company moved shop over to Universal Pictures.  That is why you see a lot of new movie development deals for Warner Bros this fall, because the studio has to keep making movies somehow, right? They’re not all going to be winners, however. One such project that really seems to this writer like scraping the bottom of the barrel is the notion of reviving a TV series adaptation that seemed stale back in the 1990s. Book of Mormon star Josh Gad has signed a deal with Warner Bros to write and star in the long-in-development Gilligan’s Island movie. The curious thing about the story is that we don’t actually know what role Josh Gad would be playing. There’s four male roles, and he could potentially be playing any of them. Well, the least likely is probably Thurston Howell III, but Gad could certainly play The Professor (the whole “nerdy scientist” thing), The Skipper (hint: they’re both “pleasantly plump”), and obviously, the movie is called Gilligan’s Island.  Anyway, so yeah, Gilligan’s Island: The Movie. Like we said above, tough year at Warner Bros.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"of, Disney, Podcast, motion, Us","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Paul-Rudd-Confirmed-as-AntMan"},{"id":"47509187604853","title":"Ron Howard Takes Over the Han Solo Movie, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ron Howard Takes Over the Han Solo Movie, and More NewsA Downton Abbey movie, more Spider-Man spinoffs, a new J-Lo rom-com, and more Tyler Perry... while Daniel Day-Lewis calls it quits.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 23, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Downton Abbey, the Han Solo prequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, and possible Spider-Man spinoffs for Mysterio and Kraven the Hunter.This WEEK’S TOP STORYRON HOWARD TO TAKE OVER DIRECTING&nbsp;HAN SOLO PREQUEL(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Universal)Those of us&nbsp;who follow movie development news may feel like we’re in the know, but every once in a while, Hollywood throws us a “monkey wrench.” For example, it was back in 2015 that Lucasfilm proudly announced that the Han Solo prequel spinoff (5/25/18) would be directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (21 Jump Street and The LEGO Movie). Sure enough, filming began&nbsp;earlier this year, following casting announcements for Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo), Donald Glover (Lando Calrissian), Emilia Clarke, Thandie Newton, and Woody Harrelson. Except, this week… Lord and Miller were fired with just two and a half weeks of filming to go. An inside source said to Variety that, “it was a culture clash from day one… [producer Kathleen Kennedy] didn’t like the way they folded their socks.” Within just two days, before speculation was even really able to take off online, Lucasfilm announced the new director of the Han Solo prequel would be Ron Howard (Apollo 13, The Da Vinci Code, A Beautiful Mind). Howard worked with&nbsp;George Lucas early in his career when he starred in American Graffiti, and&nbsp;this week, he related the time in 1972 when Lucas told him about his idea for&nbsp;a Flash Gordon-style movie with 2001: A Space Odyssey-style special effects. Of course, many questions linger (such as whether Ron Howard will do reshoots), and what the credits will look like.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;DOWNTON ABBEY MOVIE TO PRESENT ITSELF FOR FILMING IN 2018(Photo by Carnival Film and Television Limited for Masterpiece)It’s not unusual that when a very, very popular TV series airs its final season, the showrunners talk up a movie. Although we did eventually get Entourage, Veronica Mars, and Sex in the City movies, the world is still waiting on the Deadwood, Rome, and The Sopranos movies that were at one point mentioned (HBO does this a lot). The final season of Downton Abbey aired in late 2015 in the UK and in early 2016 in the US, and by the looks of things, the wait for a&nbsp;Downton Abbey&nbsp;movie will be a lot shorter than with some of those other TV shows. Michael Edelstein (president of NBCUniversal International Studios, owner of Carnival Films) said this week that “We are working on getting the script right and then we’ve got to figure out how to get the (cast) together. Because as you know, people go on and do other things. But we’re hopeful to make a movie sometime next year.” We do know that Julian Fellowes is definitely working on the Downton Abbey&nbsp;screenplay, but everyhing else — like the setting, premise, or which cast members are returning&nbsp;— remains a mystery.2. SPIDER-MAN VILLAINS MYSTERIO AND KRAVEN THE HUNTER MAY ALSO GET SPINOFF MOVIES(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures)One of the most discussed superhero-related movie stories&nbsp;this year has involved Sony’s plans to develop “Spider-Man spinoffs” separate from the Marvel Cinematic Universe that currently includes Spider-Man himself.&nbsp; The first such film will be Venom (10/5/18), and in 2019, we’re likely to get the second spinoff, Silver Sable and Black Cat (possibly shortened to just Silver and Black). In sort of a perfect example of a “buried lede,” The Hollywood Reporter inadvertently revealed that Sony Pictures is now developing spinoff movies for Spider-Man villains&nbsp;Mysterio and Kraven the Hunter, neither of whom has ever been portrayed in a live-action film. Kraven is possibly best known for the 1980s storyline “Kraven’s Last Hunt“, and Mysterio is a Hollywood special FX artist who decides to become a super villain (as one will). From that same THR story, we also now know that the second Spider-Man movie after Homecoming will feature a different MCU character (than Iron Man), and the villain in Tom Hardy’s Venom will be the blood-red alien symbiote serial killer Carnage.3. THIS WEEK IN MOVIE TITLES: JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM, JIGSAW, ROMAN ISRAEL, ESQ(Photo by Industrial Light &amp; Magic/Universal Pictures)In most weeks, there are way more than ten notable stories to cover, so we group them together when we can.&nbsp;For example, here’s where we’ll talk about three previously untitled movies that finally got their official titles. First, the franchise&nbsp;sequel we formerly called Jurassic World 2 is now officially called Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. We’ll have just under a year (6/22/18) to speculate on what the “fallen kingdom” is, but according to the first film’s director Colin Trevrrow, the sequel will be like “a Spanish horror thriller with dinosaurs.”&nbsp;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom will be directed by Spanish director J.A. Bayona, whose previous horror thrillers were The Orphanage and last year’s A Monster Calls. Speaking of horror films, we can also now report that the sequel previously called Saw: Legacy will actually be titled Jigsaw when it cuts into theaters on October 27, 2017. And finally, Denzel Washington’s previously “untitled legal drama” is now called Roman Israel, Esq. (it was also previously titled Inner City).4. JACK BLACK TO STAY IN ELI ROTH’S SPOOKY THE HOUSE WITH A CLOCK IN ITS WALLS(Photo by Hopper Stone/Columbia Pictures)Edgar Allan Poe famously helped popularize Gothic horror storytelling during the 19th century, and one of his most famous short stories is 1843’s The Tell-Tale Heart, in which the narrator is haunted by the sound of a man’s heartbeat buried within his home’s walls. This week, news emerged about a film seemingly inspired by that tale. Jack Black is now attached to star in a movie called The House with the Clock in Its Walls, to be directed by Eli Roth (Hostel, Cabin Fever). Screenwriter Eric Kripke (TV’s Supernatural and Timeless) adapted the script from a 1973 novel by John Bellairs about a young, recently orphaned boy sent to live with his uncle (Jack Black), who turns out to be a warlock. The original novel led to a series of of books, so sequels are a real possibility. Although critics came to a Fresh consensus for his first two films,&nbsp;Cabin Fever and Hostel, Eli Roth has only received Rotten scores as director for the last decade. Maybe Jack Black can help him score a Fresh Tomatometer again.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK5. CAN JENNIFER LOPEZ HELP ROM COMS RECEIVE A SECOND ACT?(Photo by Peter Iovino/CBS Films courtesy Everett Collection)With a lot of factors impacting the theatrical movie business (online streaming, demographic changes, etc), one genre that seems to have suffered in particular is the romantic comedy,&nbsp;which was a major presence perennially on the movie calendar just a decade ago but is much rarer to see&nbsp;in&nbsp;2017. That said, STX is one production company that is trying to revive the “rom-com.” After recently signing Anne Hathaway to a new romantic comedy, STX Films is now developing one&nbsp;for Jennifer Lopez. Second Act, described in the vein of Working Girl or Maid in Manhattan, will be about “a big-box store employee who reinvents her life and her lifestyle and gets the chance to prove to Madison Avenue that street smarts are as valuable as a college degree.” The film will be directed by Peter Segal (Anger Management, Tommy Boy), who hasn’t earned a Tomatometer score any higher than 55 percent for any of the eight movies he’s helmed since 1994.4. VIN DIESEL’S XXX FRANCHISE TO CONTINUE IN 4TH FILM(Photo by George Kraychyk/Paramount)Here’s yet another example of how “in Hollywood, nobody knows anything.” ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_in_the_Screen_Trade ) Earlier this year, Vin Diesel’s xXx: Return of Xander Cage was such a box office hit that, until this week, it was one of the year’s top 10 box office hits&nbsp;(it’s still #11, and could stay in the top 20 by year’s end). That success came after it took 12&nbsp;years for the film to make its way out of development. Well, it looks like xXx fans may not have to wait so long for a fourth film, because it is now officially in development. The news of xXx 4 came via the announcement of a new production company called The H Collective, which hasn’t announced a release date for xXx 4 yet, but they’re planning on releasing four movies a year, and their initial slate only has five films on it, so we’re thinking it’ll be here sooner rather than later.3. RUMOR OF THE WEEK: THE NEXT FANTASTIC FOUR MOVIE MIGHT ONLY FEATURE TWO OF THEM?(Photo by 20th Century Fox courtesy Everett Collection)Before we get into this story, there’s two things worth noting. First, it’s an unconfirmed rumor, and second, the premise alluded to here is not without comic book precedent. Throughout the 50+ years that Marvel Comics has been publishing Fantastic Four, there have been many variations on the team’s lineup that didn’t include all four classic members (indeed, two prominent lineups&nbsp;didn’t include any of them). The rumor currently circulating is that 20th Century Fox is considering yet another reboot in which only Human Torch and The Thing would be included. In this reboot, the other two&nbsp;members would be Reed and Sue’s kids, Franklin&nbsp;and Valeria Richards. Both characters have been in the comics for decades, but have never been represented in a live-action film before. 20th Century Fox’s rights to produce Fantastic Four movies reportedly expires after seven years, so the studio needs to release another film by August 7th, 2022. The studio’s previous Fantastic Four movies all received Rotten Tomatometer scores.2. TYLER PERRY ANNOUNCES TWO MOVIES FOR 2018, INCLUDING A MADEA FAMILY FUNERAL(Photo by Daniel McFadden/Lionsgate)There are just some franchises that tend to be “critic proof,” this week’s Transformers being one of them (though The Last Knight isn’t doing as well as past&nbsp;installments). Another perfect example is the output of writer/director/producer Tyler Perry, broadly, and his Madea character, specifically. Tyler Perry has a faithful audience that keeps showing up, despite his consistently poor showing on the&nbsp;Tomatometer. Lionsgate knows they have a good thing with Perry, so they have announced two new Tyler Perry films for 2018. Taraji P. Henson will star in Tyler Perry’s She’s Living My Life, which will be released on March 30th, 2018 against Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, and&nbsp;Perry himself will star in A Madea Family Funeral when it’s released on August 3rd&nbsp;of the same year.1.&nbsp;DANIEL DAY-LEWIS ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT AFTER SEWING UP PHANTOM THREAD(Photo by Paramount Vantage courtesy Everett Collection)In 1997, after starring in The Boxer, Daniel Day-Lewis announced that he was stepping away from acting, but that break only lasted five years, as he returned to film with 2002’s Gangs of New York. Day-Lewis was a lot younger then, however, and this week, the now-60-year-old actor announced that after his next film, he will finally really retire from acting. His spokesperson stated, “Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor. He is immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences over the many years. This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.” Daniel Day-Lewis’ final film will be Paul Thomas Anderson’s upcoming Phantom Thread, set in the fashion world of 1950s New York,&nbsp;which is scheduled for release on Christmas Day, December 25th, 2017. Over the course of his career, Day-Lewis has received three Academy Awards for Best Actor (My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood, Lincoln), and has starred in an impressive seven Certified Fresh films. The prospect of no more Daniel Day-Lewis is a Rotten Idea, indeed.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"streaming, comiccon, diversity, ITV, Comedy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/23145044/Ron-Howard-Han-Solo-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"ron-howard-takes-over-the-han-solo-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509188770176","title":"Dwayne Johnson Will Take Us On Disney’s Jungle Cruise, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Dwayne Johnson Will Take Us On Disney's Jungle Cruise, and More Movie NewsChristian Bale plays Dick Cheney, the Black Lagoon will spawn another Creature, and Michael Bay threatens 14 more Transformers movies.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 7, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Call of Duty, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, Dumbo, and new roles for Dwayne Johnson, Jeremy Renner, and Christian Bale (as Dick Cheney?).This WEEK’S TOP STORYDWAYNE JOHNSON WILL TAKE US ON DISNEY’S JUNGLE CRUISEThe smartest movie stars know how to make the most of their opportunities, choosing the right movies at the right time. After a successful career as a professional wrestler, Dwayne Johnson made the transition to movies quickly with 2002’s The Scorpion King, and ever since, he’s been a big screen fixture. He&nbsp;has three big movies this year alone:&nbsp;The Fate of the Furious next week, Baywatch next month, and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle this December. And right now, Johnson is also filming the Rampage video game adaptation, he’s attached to star as Black Adam in WB/DC’s Shazam!, he’ll be Jack Burton in the Big Trouble in Little China remake, and next year (or 2019), he has the action movie Skyscraper. On top of all that, he’s also been mentioned in the past as starring in Disney’s theme park attraction adaptation Jungle Cruise (a la Pirates of the Caribbean), and this week, that deal was confirmed, with Dwayne Johnson now expected to film Jungle Cruise in the spring of 2018 (probably for a 2019 release). Walt Disney Pictures is also adapting movies based on Magic Kingdom (from director Jon Favreau), It’s a Small World, and The Haunted Mansion (starring Ryan Gosling).Fresh Developments1. CHRISTIAN BALE TO SHOOT YOU IN THE FACE… AS DICK CHENEY?Writer/director Adam McKay first made his mark with Will Ferrell comedies like Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers, but his focus now is on true stories like 2015’s Academy Award Best Adapted Screenplay winner, The Big Short. With that in mind, one of McKay’s next projects is a (currently untitled) movie about former Vice President Dick Cheney. This week, we learned that McKay has put together a star package for the movie, which is now up to Paramount to either greenlight or let go. To that end, McKay has recruited Christian Bale to star as Dick Cheney, Steve Carell to play Donald Rumsfeld, and Amy Adams to play Cheney’s wife, Lynne Cheney. If the project does get made, some of the other 2000s figures we can expect to be cast probably include George W. Bush, Condoleeza Rice, and that one guy Dick Cheney shot in the face (who then went on to apologize for it). Adam McKay is also attached to direct Jennifer Lawrence in Bad Blood, about the medical testing controversy involving the Theranos company.2. RIDLEY SCOTT TO DIRECT MOVIE ABOUT BATTLE OF BRITAIN BOMBINGSHere in the United States, we’re often taught that our nation’s own involvement in World War II started in early 1942, as a reaction to the attack on Pearl Harbor in December, 1941. By that point, however, Europe was already thickly in it, as the Nazis invaded France (and other nations) in 1940, and throughout that year, Germany bombed England for several months in what is known as The Battle of Britain. This summer, director Christopher Nolan is delivering Dunkirk,&nbsp;his own movie about the early years of England’s involvement in the war, and now, we can report that another acclaimed director, Ridley Scott, is also developing a similar movie, specifically about the Battle of Britain. This WWII movie at 20th Century Fox doesn’t have a title yet, but it is described as a “passion project” for Ridley Scott (who has Alien: Covenant coming out next month). The screenplay is currently being adapted by writer Matthew Orton, who also worked on the upcoming Oscar Isaac movie Operation Finale, about the Nazi hunters who caught Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann.3. THANKS, DEADPOOL! SETH ROGEN TO ADAPT R-RATED COMIC BOOK INVINCIBLEThe success last year ($783 million globally!) of Fox’s R-rated adaptation of Deadpool is changing the way the studios greenlight “comic book” movies. Sony is reportedly considering making their Venom an R-rated horror movie, and WB/DC may also dip into less kid-friendly projects as well. One of the other benefactors of this interest in more “mature” subject matter is comics creator Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead), whose long-running superhero title Invincible is now in adaptation at Universal Pictures.&nbsp; Seth Rogen and his writer/directing partner Evan Goldberg (The Interview, This is the End) are now working on adapting the superhero series&nbsp;about a young hero whose father is basically the “Superman” of his world (except that Invincible goes into some really dark and violent territory). It’s not yet known if Rogen would also costar in Invincible.4.&nbsp;BEETLEJUICE REUNION ALERT: MICHAEL KEATON TO CO-STAR IN TIM BURTON’S DUMBOIt seems like we’ve been hearing rumors about a Beetlejuice sequel since the 1990s (indeed, we have), but we still don’t know for sure that anyone involved is actually going to make it happen (it’s even debatable if they should). Well, this week, we learned about something that might serve as a second best option, as Michael Keaton is now in talks to play the villain in Disney’s live-action remake of Dumbo, to be directed by Tim Burton. If Keaton does sign on for Dumbo, it will be his fourth film directed by Tim Burton, and the first in at least 25 years since 1992’s Batman Returns. And speaking of Batman Returns, one of the other actors in talks to star in Dumbo is Danny DeVito, who played the Penguin in that film. Other actors in talks for roles in Dumbo include Eva Green and Colin Farrell, who is also negotiating to costar in Steve McQueen’s Widows (before moving on to film Dumbo).5. TAG, YOU’RE IT, JEREMY RENNER, HANNIBAL BURESS, AND ED HELMS!Last week, we learned that Jeremy Renner will not be re-appearing in Mission: Impossible 6 (or whatever it ends up being called), due to committments to play Hawkeye in Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War and the untitled fourth Avengers movie. That may be so, but apparently, Renner was able to find time for a friendly game of Tag. We know that because both Jeremy Renner and Hannibal Buress (Daddy’s Home) are now in negotiations to star in New Line Cinema’s comedy called Tag. As the title not-so-subtly suggests, Tag is based on the true story of a group of high school friends from Spokane who spent over 30 years playing the same ongoing session of the popular playground game. If they sign on, Jeremy Renner and Hannibal Buress will be joining the already attached Ed Helms (The Hangover, Vacation).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4.&nbsp;AQUAMAN WRITER TO ADAPT SIMILARLY SOGGY CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON REMAKEWe’ve known for a while now about Universal Pictures’ ambitious/optimistic plans for a new “cinematic universe” based on their classic monsters, starting with this summer’s The Mummy, starring Tom Cruise. Other monsters known to be planned are The Invisible Man (starring Johnny Depp), Bride of Frankenstein (possibly starring Angelina Jolie), and The Wolfman (including a Dwayne Johnson rumor). Those monsters (along with Dracula) form sort of the core of Universal’s classic lineup, but another that they’re planning on resurrecting is 1954’s The Creature from the Black Lagoon. We’ve never really heard much about who might star in the Black Lagoon remake, but presumably the monster himself/itself might just be a CGI creation. This week, however, we did learn a bit more about the route Universal might be pursuing, because the screenwriter they hired is one Will Beall. In addition to writing 2013’s Gangster Squad (31 percent on the Tomatometer), Beall is also the main screenwriter credited on next year’s Aquaman, starring Jason Momoa as the popular DC Comics character. Having said that, besides the fact that both characters spend a lot of time underwater, there doesn’t seem to be much else connecting Aquaman and The Creature from the Black Lagoon.3. A BAD WEEK FOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER FRANCHISES: THE EXPENDABLES, PREDATOR, KING CONANIt’s funny sometimes how the movie development stories of a given week have a domino effect, creating a bigger picture in just a few days. One such cascade started this past weekend with the news that Sylvester Stallone has “washed his hands” of The Expendables 4&nbsp;and the franchise that he created (directing the first movie) and starred in (the first three films). That news then led to Arnold Schwarzenegger (who had a cameo in The Expendables&nbsp;and starred in the sequels) announcing that, without Stallone, he’s also out. And it snowballed from there. Schwarzenegger also mentioned this week that he&nbsp;turned down a cameo role in next February’s reboot of The Predator due to dissatisfaction with the screenplay. Then we learned that Universal Pictures has reportedly pulled the plug on plans for King Conan, which would have been the third Schwarzenegger/Conan movie (decades later). All that being said, Arnold Schwarzengger appears to think that another movie in his Terminator franchise might still happen. Are some franchises just indestructible, regardless of recent box office?2. THIS WEEK IN NEW CINEMATIC UNIVERSES: CALL OF DUTY?It’s actually sort of baffling and seemingly improbable, but dozens of movies in, we still have not had a major video game adaptation with a Fresh Tomatometer score. Recent films like Assassin’s Creed (17 percent) and Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (33 percent) did nothing to reverse the trend. And yet, optimistic plans continue to be revealed each year for would-be franchises based on popular video games. This week, we can add to that list the plans at Activision for a new “cinematic universe” based on their first-person shooter franchise, Call of Duty. By this point, there are now dozens of Call of Duty games, but they are often united more by their title and gameplay than their stories. Anyway, two Call of Duty movie concepts that were mentioned this week are Black Ops (“the story behind the story”), and Modern Warfare (“what it’s like to fight a war with the eyes of the world on you”). And of course, they could always adapt the original Call of Duty games about WWII.1. MICHAEL BAY PROMISES/THREATENS THERE MIGHT BE 14 MORE TRANSFORMERS MOVIESAlthough Michael Bay’s first Transformers movie in 2007 (ten years ago this year!) did come within three points of being Fresh, the three movies since have all been even more Rotten. We obviously don’t know yet what critics will think of this summer’s Transformers: The Last Knight&nbsp;and its post-apocalyptic setting, but it’s easy to guess. Having said that, Transformers is one of Paramount’s most reliable box office properties, and with the move towards Transformers being an annual interest, the giant robot franchise isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Talking to MTV, producer Michael Bay (who is stepping down as franchise director after the fifth movie) mentioned that last year’s “writers room” project has led to Paramount now having 14 potential Transformers movies for the future. For those keeping count, 14 movies on top of the five we have right now would be a total of nineteen Transformers movies. As for what they might be, there appear to be three options: the “main Transformers” movies (like The Last Knight), the spinoffs (like next year’s Bumblebee), and crossovers (like the rumored movie connecting to a new G.I. Joe reboot). So, out of nearly 20 movies, will any of them ever receive Fresh Tomatometer scores?","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Tumblr, psycho, VICE, TCA, the, Schedule, aapi, aliens, Cannes, rotten, Academy, Arrangement, Kids","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/07133003/Dwayne-Johnson-Jungle-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"dwayne-johnson-will-take-us-on-disneys-jungle-cruise-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509188768127","title":"Jude Law Joins Fantastic Beasts as Young Dumbledore, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jude Law Joins Fantastic Beasts as Young Dumbledore, and More Movie NewsDeadpool gets Cable, Don Cheadle and Benedict Cumberbatch join biopics, and Edgar Wright, Bill Condon, and Fede Alvarez take on new projects.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 14, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as the Bride of Frankenstein remake, Aquaman, and the sequels to both Deadpool and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.This WEEK’S TOP STORYEXPECTO PATRONUM! JUDE LAW JOINS FANTASTIC BEASTS AS YOUNG DUMBLEDORELast November, the news broke that Johnny Depp would be co-starring&nbsp;in the Fantastic Beasts sequels as antagonist Gellert Grindlewald, an announcement made imperative by the fact that&nbsp;he actually made his first appearance in the first film’s ending. Since the Fantastic Beasts movies (of which there will eventually be five)&nbsp;are prequels, we can also expect to see younger versions of some of Harry Potter’s older associates (or their parents), but the character most teased has been Aldus Dumbledore, the headmaster at Hogwarts. This week, we learned that the younger version of Dumbledore will be played by&nbsp;Jude Law, who has also worked with WB as Watson in their two Sherlock Holmes movies, and as the villain in next month’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Law won the role after Warner Bros previously considered Christian Bale, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Jared Harris, the son of Richard Harris (who originally played Dumbledore). The second and third entries in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise are scheduled for release on November 16, 2018 and November 20, 2020, respectively.Fresh Developments1. THE LONG SEARCH FOR DEADPOOL‘S PARTNER CABLE IS OVER: IT’S JOSH BROLINIf you’ve been following movie news much the last year or so, you’ve probably heard about the various actors being considered to play Cable in next year’s Deadpool sequel, including Pierce Brosnan, Liam Neeson, Kyle Chandler (Friday Nights Light), Stephen Lang (Avatar), David Harbour (Stranger Things), and most recently, Michael Shannon (General Zod from Man of Steel). All of that finally came to an end this week, and it turns out the actor cast as the time-travelling future soldier is someone who had never even been mentioned.&nbsp; Cable will be played by Josh Brolin, who’s already established&nbsp;quite a career in comic book-based movies (Thanos in the MCU,&nbsp;young Agent K&nbsp;in Men in Black 3, Jonah Hex, and Sin City: A Dame to Kill For). Brolin joins Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool (obviously), and the previously cast Zazie Beetz as fan favorite Domino.2. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST DIRECTOR MIGHT REMAKE THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEINDirector Bill Condon is at the top of the year’s box office so far&nbsp;with Disney’s remake of Beauty and the Beast, which is sort of a crossover for Condon‘s specialties, as it’s both a musical (like Chicago, which he wrote, and Dreamgirls), and a “monster” movie (like the two-part final chapter of&nbsp;The Twilight Saga). He also directed the 1998 showbiz drama Gods and Monsters (which won him a Best Screenplay Oscar), about director James Whale (Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein). So it’s somewhat&nbsp;fitting that Universal Pictures began negotiations with Condon this week to direct their remake of The Bride of Frankenstein. This project is part of Universal’s plan to create a “Universal Monsters” cinematic universe, starting with this summer’s reboot of The Mummy (starring Tom Cruise). No cast was mentioned this week, but in 2015 and 2016, rumors circulated around&nbsp;both Angelina Jolie and Javier Bardem.3. FAN FAVORITE DIRECTOR EDGAR WRIGHT JUMPS INTO GRASSHOPPER JUNGLEYou might recall a time back when Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead,&nbsp;Hot Fuzz)&nbsp;was attached to direct Marvel’s 2015 hit, Ant-Man, and if Wright had stayed on,&nbsp;he would have filmed scenes in which a human interacted with insects larger than him.&nbsp;If a new deal announced this week goes through, we might still end up with something similar. That’s because Edgar Wright is now in talks to direct an adaptation of the YA novel&nbsp;Grasshopper Jungle&nbsp;by Andrew Smith. Released in 2014, the book follows&nbsp;“a teen in Ealing, Iowa, dealing with sexual confusion as he and his friends accidentally unleash the end of the world… [via] …an unstoppable army of 6-foot-tall praying mantises.” Edgar Wright’s next film, Baby Driver, is scheduled for release this summer on June 28, 2017 (and you can see the trailer right here).4. BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH TO PRETEND TO BE THE MAN IN THE ROCKEFELLER SUITIn addition to playing Sherlock (Holmes) and Marvel’s Doctor Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch is developing quite a filmography of movies based on true stories. We’re probably forgetting something, but the&nbsp;list includes&nbsp;The Other Boleyn Girl, 12 Years a Slave, The Imitation Game, and the upcoming film, The Current War (in which he plays Thomas Edison), just to name a few. As an actor, Cumberbatch has merely pretended to be famous people in all of these movies, but this week’s news may find him pretending to be someone pretending. Benedict Cumberbatch is in early negotiations with Fox Searchlight to star in The Man in the Rockefeller Suit, based on the non-fiction book by Mark Seal. If he signs on, Cumberbatch will be starring as German criminal Christian Gerhartsreiter, whose decades of fraud and deception climaxed in the 1990s when he pretended to be Clark Rockefeller, a (fictional) member of the famous wealthy family.5. DON CHEADLE TO PLAY WALL STREET’S FIRST BLACK MILLIONAIRE IN PRINCE OF DARKNESSAnother acclaimed actor (and Marvel star) who has starred in several biopics is Don Cheadle, whose filmography includes Hamburger Hill, Rosewood, Hotel Rwanda, Talk to Me, and last year’s Miles Ahead (as jazz great Miles Davis). Cheadle will also produce and star in another biographical film called Prince of Darkness, based on the nonfiction book Prince of Darkness: The Untold Story of Jeremiah Hamilton, Wall Street’s First Black Millionaire. Like many biographies, the title does sort of explain its subject’s significance, but you can read more about Jeremiah G. Hamilton’s financial successes in the 1830s in this New York Times piece. Prince of Darkness will be adapted by screenwriter Steven Baigelman, who previously worked with Cheadle on Miles Ahead&nbsp;and on the James Brown biopic, Get On Up.6. ANIMATED SPIDER-MAN MOVIE FINDS ITS MILES MORALES: SHAMEIK MOOREOver the last few weeks, there has been a lot of press devoted to Sony’s plans for a new “cinematic universe” based on characters like Venom, Black Cat, and Silver Sable (the last two in the same movie), who are related to Spider-Man&nbsp;but will exist in their own separate world. And of course, we’re also only three months away from Spider-Man: Homecoming, the new solo movie featuring Tom Holland in the title role. With all of that going on, you’d be forgiven for forgetting (or not even knowing) that there is yet a fourth version of Spider-Man scheduled for release next year, on December 21, 2018. That (currently untitled) movie will tell the story of Miles Morales (AKA Ultimate Spider-Man in the comics), who will be depicted in animation instead of live-action. And we now know that Miles Morales will be voiced by Shameik Moore, the star of 2015’s Dope (and one of the costars of Netflix’s The Get Down). Liev Schreiber (AKA Sabretooth in X-Men Origins: Wolverine) has also signed on to play the film’s villain, but we don’t know yet who that’s going to be.7. EVIL DEAD REMAKE DIRECTOR TO ALSO REIMAGINE FANTASY CLASSIC LABYRINTHThe brutal year of celebrity deaths that was 2016 got its start early on, with the devastating news on January 10th that David Bowie had passed. Just twelve days later, we also learned that the Jim Henson Company had closed a deal with Sony/TriStar to revisit the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth (in which Bowie starred as Jareth the Goblin King). At that time, it was unclear if the new Labyrinth movie would be a direct sequel, a remake, or something else entirely. This week’s news brings with it the clarification that the new film will be set in the “world” of Labyrinth without being either a remake or a direct sequel. And the creative folks that will be developing the new Labyrinth are director Fede Alvarez and screenwriter Jay Basu (Monsters: Dark Continent), who are also preparing for next year’s The Girl in the Spider’s Web (also for Sony). In addition to last year’s horror hit Don’t Breathe, Alvarez also directed another recent remake, 2013’s Evil Dead, while screenwriter Jay Basu has worked on video game adaptations in the form of both Dante’s Inferno and Metal Gear Solid (both still in development).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. MARVEL’S ORIGINAL PUNISHER TO PLAY VILLAIN KING IN DC’S AQUAMANIt’s becoming more and more common that actors cast in various superhero movies have already starred in various superhero movies. Pretty soon, it may be more of a story when someone joins a Marvel or DC property who hasn’t been in one before. But this week, Warner Bros went truly old school, casting the star of one of the first Marvel Comics movies ever — the 1991 direct-to-video movie&nbsp;The Punisher&nbsp;— for one of their upcoming tentpole films. We’re talking about Dolph Lundgren, who also starred as He-Man in the 1987 live-action version of Masters of the Universe, and as Soviet boogeyman boxer Ivan Drago in Rocky IV. Lundgren has been cast in next year’s Aquaman (12/21/18) as what amounts to our third known villain, King Nereus of Xebel, who was introduced relatively recently (2013) as part of the&nbsp;New 52 reimagining of many of DC’s&nbsp;core heroes. Lundgren’s character will be the king of a rival underwater kingdom “who claims Mera [Amber Heard] as his own and wants to kill Aquaman.” Lundgren joins an ensemble cast&nbsp;that already includes two other villains: Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson) and Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). We’re calling this one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because, wow, Dolph Lundgren? That’s old school Rotten.1. KEVIN HART (AND FRIENDS) WILL ENROLL IN NIGHT SCHOOL COMEDYComedian Kevin Hart is currently on something of an impressive run of hit movies, which includes the Ride Along&nbsp;films (with Ice Cube), Central Intelligence (with Dwayne Johnson), and as one of the lead voices in The Secret Life of Pets. Hart will co-star again with Johnson in this December’s Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, and another&nbsp;Ride Along sequel&nbsp;is also in development. This week, we learned Hart is set to produce and star in another comedy for Universal (home of the&nbsp;Ride Along franchise), and it’s called Night School. As the title suggests, Night School will be about “a group of misfits forced to attend adult classes to prepare for the GED exam.”&nbsp; This will also be a reunion project for Hart and director Tim Story, whose Tomatometer includes Rotten scores for the first two Fantastic Four movies and the two aforementioned Ride Along movies.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"documentary, USA, Women's, Films, fast, Channel, PaleyFest, joker, Arts, Review","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14020300/Jude-Law-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"jude-law-joins-fantastic-beasts-as-young-dumbledore-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509188763003","title":"Stranger Things Star David Harbour Will Star In A Hellboy Reboot, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Stranger Things Star David Harbour Will Star In A Hellboy Reboot, and More Movie NewsThe New Mutants snags a couple of starlets, and new roles go to Tom Hanks, Margot Robbie, Peter Dinklage, Johnnie Depp, and a bunch more people.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 12, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Avatar 2, Hellboy: Rise of the Blood Queen, The New Mutants, and new roles for Benedict Cumberbatch, Johnny Depp, Tom Hanks, and Margot Robbie.This WEEK’S TOP STORYHELLBOY TO GET HORROR REBOOT? WE’VE SEEN STRANGER THINGS(Photo by Universal, Curtis Baker/Netflix courtesy Everett Collection)This week’s biggest and most surprising news was sort of a confluence of two stories from earlier in the year. First, there was the Twitter announcement from director Guillermo Del Toro in February that, “Hellboy 3 Sorry to report: Spoke w all parties. Must report that 100% the sequel will not happen. And that is to be the final thing about it.” Note that Del Toro was speaking specifically about a sequel to the two Hellboy movies that he directed, starring Ron Perlman. Also, earlier this year, David Harbour (Stranger Things) was in contention for the role&nbsp;of Cable in Deadpool 2, suggesting he&nbsp;was interested in starring in a comic book movie — that role eventually went to Josh Brolin instead. Put all of that together, and it leads to this week’s news of a Hellboy reboot starring David Harbour&nbsp;and&nbsp;directed by Neil Marshall (The Descent, the Blackwater and Watchers on the Wall episodes of Game of Thrones.) The new movie, possibly titled Hellboy: Rise of the Blood Queen, will be from Millennium Films, the company best known for mid-level budget action movies like The Expendables and Olympus Has Fallen. The Hellboy reboot was described by its new screenwriter as, “a darker, more gruesome version of Hellboy… walk[ing] a razor’s edge between horror and comic book movie.”Fresh Developments1. CLIFF CURTIS CAST IN THE AVATAR SEQUELS AS “REEF PEOPLE” LEADER(Photo by Fox Searchlight)Even those&nbsp;who never saw James Cameron’s 2009 hit Avatar&nbsp;are likely to&nbsp;know it involved blue aliens that looked like a cross&nbsp;between deer and elves (i.e. the Na’vi). Cameron has been talking about his sequels for years and years now, including the detail that the story would be moving to Pandora’s oceans. This week, Fox and Cameron revealed their first new cast member, confirming the new setting. Prolific character actor Cliff Curtis, currently starring on AMC’s Fear the Walking Dead, has signed on to play&nbsp;“Tonowari, the leader of the Metkayina reef people clan.” What we don’t know from that description&nbsp;is whether the “reef people” are also Na’vi, another Pandoran race, or a little bit of both. 20th Century Fox has scheduled the four Avatar sequels for December dates in 2020, 2021, 2024, and 2025, starting with Avatar 2 on December 18, 2020.2. HUGH BONNEVILLE TO PORTRAY ROALD DAHL IN BIOPIC(Photo by Laurie Sparham/Weinstein Company courtesy Everett Collection)The works of British children’s authors have inspired a number of big screen adaptations, but their lives themselves have also provided some rich material. Some notable examples include Finding Neverland (Peter Pan creator J.M. Barrie), Shadowlands (Narnia creator C.S. Lewis), Saving Mr. Banks (Mary Poppins creator P.L. Travers), and Miss Potter (Peter Rabbit creator Beatrix Potter). Another prolific British author was Roald Dahl, whom we can thank for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Witches, Matilda, and last year’s The BFG. Well, it’s finally Dahl’s turn to receive a (shared) biopic, and the actor who has landed the role is Hugh Bonneville.&nbsp;Downton Abbey fans will know Bonneville for portraying Lord Robert Crawley, the 7th Earl of Grantham. The currently untitled biopic will tell “a bittersweet, comedic story focusing on Dahl’s marriage to actress Patricia Neal, [as] the story moves between New York, England and Los Angeles in the early 1960s, a time when Dahl struggled to write some of his most famous works and Neal returned to acting with Hud.”3. BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AND JAKE GYLLENHAAL MEET UP IN&nbsp;RIO(Photo by Jason Smith, John Nacion / Everett Collection)Italian director Luca Guadagnino has yet to have a hit in the USA, but after his debut in 2010 (I Am Love), he has continued to attract actors that suggest it might just happen for him soon. For example, Guadagnino’s 2016 film, A Bigger Splash, featured the talents of Tilda Swinton, Dakota Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes. If negotiations work out for his fourth film, titled Rio (not to be confused with the 2011 animated hit of the same name),&nbsp;Guardagnino will be assisted by&nbsp;Benedict Cumberbatch and Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal will play a financial reporter who travels to Rio de Janeiro to visit a wealthy friend (Benedict Cumberbath), only to find himself sucked into a plot to fake his friend’s death. Like many of the films covered in this week’s Ketchup, Rio is making the news now in advance of being sold to various international markets at next week’s Cannes Film Festival.4. ARYA STARK AND THE WITCH CONFIRMED AS WOLFSBANE AND MAGIK IN THE NEW MUTANTS(Photo by Dee Cercone, James Atoa / Everett Collection)Blogs, websites, and columns about film development (like this one) sometimes cover news years ahead of time, but we can’t necessarily presume everyone will remember every detail. Consider, for example, the news from March of last year about the rumored casting of two of the leads in next year’s X-Men spinoff, The New Mutants (4/13/18), to be directed by Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars). As it turns out, that story was on the money, but the official announcement didn’t happen until this week. Maisie Williams, best known as Arya Stark from Game of Thrones, has been cast as Rahne Sinclair, AKA Wolfsbane, a Scottish teenager with the ability to turn into a wolf (and a halfway werewolf form too). Anya Taylor-Joy, the star of last year’s The Witch (and this year’s Split) has been cast as Illyana Rasputin, AKA Magik, the little sister of Colossus, who can teleport, use magic, and also has a really big sword. As The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;reports, “Fox is making serious efforts to find ethnically appropriate actors, conducting wide searches for a Native American to play Moonstar and a South American for Sunspot.” The other New Mutants will be Cannonball and Warlock, but apparently, not founding member (in the comics), Karma.5. PETER DINKLAGE TO STAR IN “TATTOO” DRAMA, MY DINNER WITH HERVE(Photo by MGM courtesy Everett Collection)If you’ve been following film development news long enough, you may be familiar with a biopic called My Dinner with Herve, which&nbsp;refers to 1970s actor Herve Villechaize. Villechaize (who was also a dwarf) was basically known for two roles: the villain Nick Nack in the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun&nbsp;and (more famously) Tattoo on the ABC TV show&nbsp;Fantasy Island.&nbsp;Villechaize also struggled with&nbsp;personal demons, ending his own life in 1993. It’s not yet known how much&nbsp;My Dinner with Herve will explore the latter, but we now know that Villechaize will be portrayed by Peter Dinklage, AKA Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones. Jamie Dornan (Fifty Shades of Grey) will costar with Dinklage as a struggling journalist who finds himself spending a wild night with Villechaize, partying at locations all over Los Angeles. HBO Films is producing, but the company may also seek a theatrical release.6. MARGOT ROBBIE TO PRODUCE AND STAR IN 1930S DUST BOWL THRILLER DREAMLAND(Photo by Frank Masi/Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Australian actress Margot Robbie is probably best known for starring as Harley Quinn in last year’s Suicide Squad and Jane in&nbsp;The Legend of Tarzan, but in the near future, she’ll be starring in three biopics (I, Tonya; Goodbye Christopher Robin; and Mary Queen of Scots), and she also voiced a role in next year’s animated version of Peter Rabbit. On top of all that Robbie is also taking control of her own agency by becoming a producer, and the latest film project she’s producing for herself as a starring vehicle&nbsp;is called Dreamland. Set during the “Dust Bowl” devastation of Depression Era America, Dreamland is a bank robber thriller about “a 15-year-old boy on his quest to capture a fugitive bank robber (Robbie) and collect the bounty on her head, all with the goal of saving his family farm from foreclosure.” Director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte is reportedly, “hoping to bring a balance of nostalgic beauty and gritty realism to the proceedings as well as a balance between a sense of romanticism and a sense of violence.”7. DANIEL RADCLIFFE TO SHOOT AT PEOPLE, GUNS AKIMBORyan FujitaniAnother actor who continues to establish a new identity on the big screen&nbsp;is Daniel Radcliffe, the former Harry Potter child star. Last year saw the release of probably the craziest example of his efforts to branch out, in the form of Swiss Army Man, in which he played a corpse with amazing gastrointestinal “powers.” Radcliffe is now attached to star in an action comedy called Guns Akimbo, to be directed by New Zealand’s Jason Lei Howden, who made his debut with the heavy metal comedy Deathgasm. Radcliffe will play&nbsp;a man with a dead-end job who finds himself “enrolled on a dark net website that forces complete strangers to fight in a city-wide game of death so that their gladiatorial battles can be live-streamed worldwide to a fanatical audience.”8. TOM HANKS TO STAR IN WESTERN NOVEL ADAPTATION NEWS OF THE WORLD(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Walt Disney Studios courtesy Everett Collection)Tom Hanks has obviously starred in a wide variety of films during his lengthy career, but he has yet to appear in a Western. That’s about to change, as he&nbsp;is now attached to star in a film adaptation of the Paulette Jiles novel&nbsp;News of the World, written by Luke Davies (Lion) for Fox 2000. Hanks will star as Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, a Texas cowboy in 1870 who “travels from town to town to read the news to locals who would otherwise not know what is going on in the world. While Kidd is sparked up by spreading the word of the passage of the 15th Amendment that gave voting rights to all men, he agrees to escort a 10-year-old white girl to her aunt and uncle in San Antonio after she was rescued from the Kiowa Indian tribe that kidnapped her and killed her family four years earlier. His traveling partner is an ornery youngster who didn’t want to be rescued and brought to her relatives.”9. JOHNNY DEPP SAYS HELLO TO RICHARD SAYS GOODBYEIn RT’s latest 24 Frames gallery, you can browse through “24 Dicks We Love From Movies and TV” to mark the debut of Amazon’s I Love Dick. Well, Johnny Depp is now attached to star in a dramedy called Richard Says Goodbye, so we might have another to add to the list.&nbsp;This will be the second film from indie director Wayne Roberts, who made his debut last year with the similarly titled Katie Says Goodbye, starring Olivia Cooke, Mireille Enos, James Belushi, and Mary Steenburgen. Depp will star as “a world-weary college professor who is given a life-changing diagnosis and then decides to throw all pretense and conventions to the wind and live his life as boldly and freely as possible. With a biting sense of humor, a reckless streak and a touch of madness, he binges through every vice: smoking, drinking, sex, and hurling blunt insults at anyone who annoys him, giving him more pleasure than he’s had in years.” Johnny Depp previously starred in a similar film, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, based on the novel by Hunter S. Thompson.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Pictures, Annual, Best, Arrowverse, nfl, drama, best, Comics, docuseries, CW","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/12135517/Harbour-Hellboy-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"stranger-things-star-david-harbour-will-star-in-a-hellboy-reboot-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509188757880","title":"Netflix Stars Join X-Men Spinoff The New Mutants, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Netflix Stars Join X-Men Spinoff The New Mutants, and More Movie NewsHailee Steinfeld will play with Transformers, Carey Mulligan becomes a Vietnam War POW, and Michelle Williams teams up with Amy Schumer.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 2, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Bumblebee, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and The New Mutants.This WEEK’S TOP STORYNETFLIX STARS JOIN SPOOKY X-MEN SPINOFF THE NEW MUTANTS(Photo by EuropaCorp USA courtesy Everett Collection)It was a year ago&nbsp;we first heard that two of the stars of The New Mutants (the long-anticipated X-Men spinoff) would be Maisie Williams (Arya Stark from Game of Thrones) and Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch) as Wolfsbane and Magik, respectively. (It was finally confirmed last month). In the&nbsp;meantime, we still didn’t know who would play the other three core New Mutants: Cannonball, Sunspot, and Danielle Moonstar. With the release date less than a year away (April 13, 2018), Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars) has to start filming really soon, so this week, we finally got our answers. The highest profile of our three new stars is probably Charlie Heaton, who starred in Stranger Things as brooding teenager Jonathan Bryers, and who has now been cast as Southern rocket-fueled teenager Cannonball. Another Netflix series, 13 Reasons Why, also gave us Henry Zaga, who will also star as Sunspot. Finally, there’s newcomer Blu Hunt, who won an international search to play Native American mutant Danielle “Dani” Moonstar. Rosario Dawson will also co-star in The New Mutants as onetime X-Men member Dr. Cecilia Reyes.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;SILICON VALLEY STAR THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH TO FACE DOWN GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS(Photo by HBO)As Wonder Woman neared its release, the news from Warner Bros this week mostly had to do with their Godzilla franchise. The upcoming 2019 movie will be Godzilla: King of the Monsters (3/22/19), which will be the direct sequel to the 2014 Godzilla reboot (and might introduce Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah!). That film&nbsp;has already made some casting announcements, mostly about the film’s core family of humans: Millie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things), Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights), and Vera Farmiga (Bates Motel). We don’t know his role yet, but the newest cast member is Thomas Middleditch, who you might know from either HBO’s Silicon Valley or those recent Verizon commercials.&nbsp;King of the Monsters will be directed by Michael Dougherty (Trick ‘r’ Treat, Krampus), but&nbsp;we also learned who will direct its follow-up,&nbsp;Godzilla vs Kong, scheduled for May 22, 2020.&nbsp;Adam Wingard, who has focused on smaller scale horror like You’re Next, The Guest, and last year’s Blair Witch sequel, has made a deal with Warner Bros to direct Godzilla vs Kong, the movie that ties this year’s Kong: Skull Island directly to&nbsp;the Godzilla series.2. THIS WEEK IN WAR CORRESPONDENT BIOPICS: CAREY MULLIGAN’S ON THE OTHER SIDE(Photo by Focus Features)We’ve known for a while about the untitled biopic about war journalist Marie Colvin starring&nbsp;Gone Girl‘s Rosamund Pike. This week, we found out Carrie Mulligan (The Great Gatsby) will be starring in her own war correspondent film, called&nbsp;On the Other Side, as Australian journalist&nbsp;Kate Webb. Unlike Colvin’s story, which culiminates with her encounters with ISIS, On the Other Side will focus on Webb’s&nbsp;experiences during the 1970s as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. Mulligan can be seen later this year in the dramas Wildlife and Mudbound.3. MICHELLE WILLIAMS JOINS AMY SCHUMER IN&nbsp; COMEDY I FEEL PRETTY(Photo by Michael Gibson/Magnolia Pictures)Amy Schumer seems to enjoy pairing&nbsp;up with other female stars. There was Brie Larson in Trainwreck, Goldie Hawn in Snatched, and the upcoming comedy in which&nbsp;Jennifer Lawrence plays Schumer’s sister. The next actress to partner with Schumer in a movie will be Michelle Williams, who earned an Oscar nod this year for her powerful work in Kenneth Lonergan’s&nbsp;Manchester by the Sea. In the new comedy, called&nbsp;I Feel Pretty, Williams will play the boss of Schumer’s character, an insecure woman who suffers a fall and recovers, but begins to imagine that she’s “the most beautiful and capable person on the planet… [which] suddenly sees her climbing the ranks at the cosmetics company she works for, and thereby obtaining the respect of her idol and boss.” Before Williams starts filming I Feel Pretty, though, she’ll also be filming her role in Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, about the 1970s kidnapping of oil heir J. Paul Getty.4. VIGGO MORTENSEN FOLLOWS CAPTAIN FANTASTIC BY READING THE GREEN BOOK(Photo by John Harris/20th Century Fox)Peter Farrelly is best known as one half of the Farrelly Brothers, the directors of such comedies&nbsp;as Kingpin, Dumb and Dumber, There’s Something About Mary, and The Three Stooges. Lately, however, it looks like Farrelly is looking to change things up a bit, starting with his next film,&nbsp;Green Book. The indie period piece will tell the true story of a NYC bouncer named Tony Lip who takes a new job as the chauffeur of a young piano prodigy during a tour of the “Deep South” in 1962.&nbsp;Viggo Mortensen is currently in talks to star as Tony Lip, which would be his first major role since last year’s Academy Award nominated Captain Fantastic. You may also know the real Tony Lip (1930-2013) from his roles as gangsters and mob associates&nbsp;in The Godfather, The Sopranos, and Donnie Brasco.5. MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL TO SCHOOL EVERYONE&nbsp;AS THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHER(Photo by Warner Bros.)Maggie Gyllenhaal has been fairly quiet the past couple of years, save for a few short films and the upcoming HBO series The Deuce&nbsp;(premiering on September 10), but she’ll be returning to the big screen in an&nbsp;English-language adaptation of the 2014 Israeli film The Kindgergarten Teacher, to be directed by Sara Colengo (Little Accidents). Gyllenhaal will play a Staten Island kindergarten teacher who “discovers what may be a prodigious five-year old poet in her class, she becomes obsessed with the child and his talent— risking her career, family, and freedom.”&nbsp;The Kindergarten Teacher is being produced by Maven Pictures, the indie company behind movies like Bernie and The Kids Are All Right.6.&nbsp;CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS TO BE FOLLOWED BY THE WITCH BOY and&nbsp;A PET BLACK HOLE(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)It might have seemed strange this week that 20th Century Fox scheduled their own animated superhero movie, Captain Underpants, directly against the highly anticipated, 80-years-in-the-making Wonder Woman. Even though Captain Underpants was clearly never going to do any better this week than #2, that might not be so so bad after all, since it&nbsp;was made on a budget of just $38 million (Wonder Woman, by contrast, reportedly cost $149 million). This week, Fox Animation announced two more films, beginning with an adaptation of Molly Ostertag‘s&nbsp;graphic novel The Witch Boy,&nbsp;about a 13-year-old boy who is expected to become a shapeshifter (like his other male relatives), but follows the female family tradition of being a witch instead.&nbsp; The second new Fox Animation project this week is called The Care and Feeding of a Pet Black Hole, which is somehow exactly what it sounds like.7. RON HOWARD TO FOLLOW THE BEATLES: EIGHT DAYS A WEEK WITH A PAVAROTTI DOCUMENTARY(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)Last year, Ron Howard took a detour from his usual feature films (while also directing Inferno) with the rock documentary, The Beatles: Eight Days a Week. The busy and prolific director of movies like Apollo 13 and The Da Vinci Code will next direct another musical documentary, but this time, it will be about the late operatic tenor&nbsp;Luciano Pavarotti. Imagine Entertainment has made a deal with Pavarotti’s estate to obtain access to a vast archive of footage from throughout Pavarotti’s life, much of which has never been seen by a wide audience (especially not since first broadcast).&nbsp; Here’s some of what Ron Howard had to say about Luciano Pavarotti: “I am now going to school on this. For instance, I had no idea what a physical feat it is to generate those sounds, especially night in and night out. It is the function of years of dedicated training and a commitment to turn your body into that kind of instrument. It’s not just a matter of some people having a good set of pipes and others don’t.” Howard recently directed an episode of the cable series Einstein, and will return next year as the narrator of Netflix’s Arrested Development.8. MAYA RUDOLPH, TERRY CREWS, MAYA RUDOLPH AND MORE TO VOICE THE WILLOUGHBYS(Photo by Suzanne Hanover/Universal Pictures)Bron Animation is a new Canadian animation company that has recruited a number of industry professionals who have worked on such movies as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Open Season, and Arthur Christmas. One of their first productions will be an adaptation of author Lois Lowry’s (The Giver)&nbsp;2010 children’s book The Willoughbys, about&nbsp;four children who enjoy going off on adventures against the wishes of their “neglectful mother and father.” In April, we first heard that the movie will be narrated by Ricky Gervais. The voice cast has since been filled out a lot more:&nbsp;Martin Short and Jane Krakowski will voice the parents, who are “so in love with each other that they forget they even have children,” and Sean Cullen will voice the two twin brothers Barnaby A and B. Maya Rudolph will voice the nanny who watches the children, and Terry Crews will voice “candy mogul Commander Melanoff.”&nbsp;The Willoughbys will be directed by Kris Pearn, who previously codirected Cloudy with the Chance of Meatballs 2, and worked as an animator on&nbsp;The Pirates! Band of Misfits, Open Season 2, and Surf’s Up.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1. HAILEE STEINFELD IN TALKS TO STAR IN TRANSFORMERS SPINOFF BUMBLEBEE(Photo by Bob Mahoney/Focus World courtesy Everett Collection)In three weeks, Paramount Pictures will be releasing Transformers: The Last Knight (6/21/17), the latest film in what is now the studio’s biggest franchise. After that, Paramount will be expanding the franchise to include&nbsp;spinoffs, the first of which will be Bumblebee, scheduled for June 8, 2018. These spinoffs present&nbsp;opportunities to bring in new cast members, and this week, we learned who will&nbsp;follow in the footsteps of Shia LeBeouf, Megan Fox, and Mark Wahlberg. It sounds like it’s going to be Hailiee Steinfeld, who is probably best known for making a big debut with the Coen brothers’ remake of True Grit&nbsp;and last year’s The Edge of Seventeen. The Bumblebee spinoff will be directed by Travis Knight, who will be making his live-action debut after directing LAIKA films like Kubo and the Two Strings. As much as we like Hailee Steinfeld, and as wonderful as Kubo and the Two Strings was,&nbsp;all five of the Transformers movies to date have earned Rotten Tomatometer scores. Hopefully Hailee can help improve Bumblebee‘s chances.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"YouTube, TBS, Pet, Family, TCA, E!","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/02183056/Charlie-Heaton-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"netflix-stars-join-x-men-spinoff-the-new-mutants-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509188760954","title":"Tom Hardy Signs On As Sony’s Venom, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Tom Hardy Signs On As Sony's Venom, and More Movie NewsNew roles go to a slew of stars, including Sandra Bullock, Johnny Depp, Zac Efron, Rosamund Pike, Matthew McConaughey, and Daniel Radcliffe.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 19, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as The Flash and Marvel’s Venom, as well as new roles for Sandra Bullock, Johnny Depp, Zac Efron, Matthew McConaughey, and Daniel Radcliffe.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTOM HARDY IS THE&nbsp;NEW VENOM, IN THEATERS OCTOBER 2018Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock in #Venom, the upcoming film from Sony’s Marvel Universe releasing October 5, 2018 – production starts this fall. pic.twitter.com/OZQqDEvoum— Sony Pictures (@SonyPictures) May 19, 2017Sony Pictures is in desperate need of a big box office hit franchise, following a few years when would-be attempts like RoboCop, Pixels, Chappie, The 5th Wave, Ghostbusters, Inferno, Life, and Smurfs: The Lost Village all failed to come through for the studio. To that end, the studio recently scheduled their adaptation of Marvel’s Venom for October 5, 2018. Picking a date less than a year and a half away meant, however, that they’d have to really hustle to find a director and star. Sony now has both, with this week’s late-breaking news that Tom Hardy is finalizing a deal to star as Eddie Brock, AKA Venom, in a film to be directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad). Although Venom is a Marvel Comics character, Venom will not be a spinoff of Sony’s Spider-Man: Homecoming (7/7/17) (which is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe). Instead, the film&nbsp;will start a new shared universe of Marvel Comics characters which are separate from the MCU. The second movie in that effort will be an untitled film about Black Cat (also a character closely connected to Spider-Man) and Silver Sable. Hardy celebrated the Venom news today by posting an Instagram image of himself wearing a Venom t-shirt (which you see above).Fresh Developments1. JOHNNY DEPP CAST AS ANTIVIRUS MOGUL IN&nbsp;KING OF THE JUNGLEIn today’s online world of 2017, you have a lot of good options for protecting your computer from viruses and other threats, but there was a time when “antivirus” and “McAfee” were essentially synonymous. The man behind that name was John McAfee, a reportedly gregarious but divisive personality, whose estate in Belize was the subject of several criminal investigations.&nbsp;WIRED magazine was a key source for reporting on McAfee in 2012, including stories like this&nbsp;and an e-book called John McAfee’s Last Stand. Now, the web security mogul’s story will soon be adapted as a “dark comedy” called King of the Jungle, with Johnny Depp attached to star as McAfee himself. (This news comes just a week after another new project for Depp.) King of the Jungle will be directed by the team of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (Crazy Stupid Love, I Love You Phillip Morris), from a screenplay adapted by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, whose previous movies based on true stories include&nbsp;Big Eyes, Man on the Moon, and The People Vs Larry Flynt.2. ROSAMUND PIKE TO STAR IN MARIE CURIE BIOPIC RADIOACTIVE(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Marie Curie‘s life story was one of obvious highs (tremendous professional success) and lows (dying in a sanitorium from cancer due to all of the radiation she was exposed to in her studies). Given that, you would think that her story might have been depicted on film more than it has, but this week, we learned that she&nbsp;will soon indeed receive some high profile attention. Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) is now attached to star as the groundbreaking scientist in the appropriately titled drama Radioactive. This film, produced by Working Title Films, will be directed by French director Marjane Satrapi, who is currently best known for her animated adaptation of the Persepolis graphic novels.&nbsp;Radioactive is Pike’s second new biopic project in as many months, after April’s news that she will also star in an untitled Marie Colvin film. It’s enough to make you wonder which famous Marie&nbsp;she’ll&nbsp;play next.3. SANDRA BULLOCK MIGHT NEED A CASH TRUCK IF THE MOVIE’S A HIT(Photo by Warner Bros.)Sandra Bullock’s film career is on something of a hiatus right now, with only one live action movie (2015’s Our Brand is Crisis) since her big 2013 hit, Gravity (she did voice the villain in Minions, too). That may change next year, starting with the release of the spinoff Ocean’s Eight (6/8/18), especially if this week’s news results in another&nbsp;2018 release. Sandra Bullock is now attached to star&nbsp;in Cash Truck, which is inspired by (but apparently not a direct remake of) the 2004 French film Le Convoyeur, and like Ocean’s Eight, this new movie also involves a heist, but it’s more of an intense thriller. Bullock will play an American woman who takes a job at a London armored car company that was recently the target of a deadly heist… but not everyone or everything is exactly&nbsp;as it seems.&nbsp;Cash Truck will be directed by Josef Wladyka, who has directed three episodes of season two of Netflix’s crime drama Narcos.4. DANIEL RADCLIFFE TO PLAN AN ESCAPE FROM PRETORIA(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Warner Bros.)One enduring Hollywood trope is the “prison escape” movie, and the distinguished list of actors who have made such a film includes Steve McQueen (The Great Escape), Clint Eastwood (Escape from Alcatraz), Tim Robbins (The Shawshank Redemption), and Dustin Hoffman (Papillon, also with Steve McQueen). Soon, we’ll be able to add former Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe to that list, because he is now attached to star in a true story drama called Escape from Pretoria. Radcliffe will play Tim Jenkin, “one of two 20-something white South Africans branded as terrorists and imprisoned in 1978 for being involved in covert anti-apartheid operations for the African National Congress. Jailed in the Pretoria Maximum Security Prison, the pair decide to send the regime a clear message and plan an escape.”5. JONAH HILL TO STAR IN CRIME THRILLER UNCUT GEMS(Photo by Sony Pictures)Just last year, Jonah Hill starred in War Dogs, about the true story of two young entrepreneurs who became arms dealers. Depending on what his role in this week’s news actually involves (we don’t know right now), Jonah Hill’s new film might be a similar project. The movie in question is called Uncut Gems, and the only thing we know about the premise is that it somehow involves New York City’s famous 47th Street Diamond District. Maybe Hill plays a jeweler who gets robbed, or someone who wants to rob some jewels, or some combination of the two, or maybe a cop?&nbsp;Uncut Gems will be directed by Benny Safdie&nbsp;and will be produced by Scott Rudin, who previously worked with Jonah Hill on the baseball true story&nbsp;Moneyball.6. MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY TO PLAY TO TYPE AS THE BEACH BUM(Photo by Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)If you were paying attention to celebrity news back in 1999, you may remember&nbsp;a famous story involving Matthew McConaughey, copious amounts of weed, and a pair of bongo drums. At the time, it offered some evidence that McConaughey wasn’t so different from his&nbsp;Dazed and Confused character in real life.&nbsp;McConaughey is probably only&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;a beach bum in reality, but in an upcoming movie, he will be one rather literally, as he’s now confirmed to be starring in an “irreverent comedy” called The Beach Bum, playing “Moondog… a rebellious and lovable rogue who lives life large.”&nbsp;The Beach Bum is described as director Harmony Korine‘s&nbsp;follow up to his 2012 crime drama Spring Breakers, but it’s unclear if the film is&nbsp;a straight-up sequel (as some sources have speculated). Korine and McConaughey will start filming The Beach Bum this fall, aiming for a theatrical release in late 2018.7. ZAC EFRON AS TED BUNDY WILL BE EXTREMELY WICKED, SHOCKINGLY EVIL AND VILE(Photo by Anne Marie Fox/Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Serial killers have been popular movie fodder&nbsp;for decades,&nbsp;especially since the 1970s, when both slasher movies and real life serial killers permeated the pop culture consciousness, but in the 1980s, Ted Bundy&nbsp;changed the public perception of what a serial killer might look like. Back in 2015, this led film critic Alonso Duralde to make the prediction that Zac Efron would be cast as Ted Bundy within five years. Well, Mr. Duralde wins, because that’s exactly who Zac Efron will be playing in a new crime drama called Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile. The film will be told from the perspective of “Elizabeth Kloepfer, Bundy’s longtime girlfriend, who went years denying the accusations against Bundy but ultimately turned him in to the police.” The film will be the second narrative feature (after Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2) from director Joe Berlinger, who is best known for the Paradise Lost true crime documentaries about the West Memphis Three.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. THIS WEEK IN SILENTS: JESSE EISENBERG AS MARCEL MARCEAU, CHAPLIN’S THE KID GETS REMADE(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)Not all forms of art are universally popular, or as popular in some cultures as they are in others. Silent movies, popular in the U.S. during the early 20th century, were eventually replaced by “talkies,” and in places like France,&nbsp;mime artists remained popular —&nbsp;the most famous of them was probably&nbsp;Marcel Marceau. This week, another side of Marceau’s life made the news, as Jesse Eisenberg is now attached to star as the famous mime in a movie about his activities during WWII. The movie will be called Resistance, and it will tell the true story of how Marceau (formerly Mangel) helped Jewish refugees, and how his own father died in Auschwitz. Resistance will be written and directed by Jonathan Jakubowicz, whose two credits both have Rotten Tomatometer scores. In similar news, we can now report that Charlie Chaplin’s classic silent comedy The Kid is being remade as an animated science fiction film, from Rise of the Planet of the Apes director Rupert Wyatt, whose most recent film was also a remake, The Gambler (Rotten at 46 percent).1. SEVERAL DIRECTORS HAVE CONSIDERED THE FLASH, BUT WHY DO THEY KEEP DROPPING OUT?(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)At one point, Warner Bros had scheduled The Flash for release on March 16th, 2018, but that was when it was to be directed by Rick Famuyiwa (Dope), who&nbsp;then dropped out. Since Famuyiwa’s departure, the most prominent director mentioned in conjunction with the film has been Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump), and according to&nbsp;The Wrap, he’s still the frontrunner for the job. Unfortunately, they seem to be the only ones who think so. Some thought&nbsp;it could have&nbsp;been directed by Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) or Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man)… until they both passed. Others speculate it could be X-Men: First Class director Matthew Vaughn.&nbsp;The interesting thing about Robert Zemeckis’ name still being in the mix is that the three others mentioned this week have all directed superhero movies before, while Zemeckis has not. We’re calling all of this a “Rotten Idea” because we hope to get an awesome Flash movie someday, but every time a promising director is mentioned and he drops out, it puts a damper on our expectations.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Month, Writers, Cannes, Swim, Film, street, die, binge, Cinematographers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19172918/Tom-Hardy-Venom-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"tom-hardy-signs-on-as-sonys-venom-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509190237575","title":"Mel Gibson in Talks to Direct Suicide Squad 2, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Mel Gibson in Talks to Direct Suicide Squad 2, and More Movie NewsRobert Downey Jr. reunites with Richard Linklater, Thandie Newton joins Han Solo, Logan may get an X-23 spinoff, and Super Bowl LI spawns a pair of new movies.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 17, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as The Batman, Jurassic World 2, the possible X-23 spinoff, and new roles for Robert Downey Jr., Oscar Isaac, and Michelle Rodriguez.This WEEK’S TOP STORYDIRECTOR NEWS FOR THE BATMAN AND SUICIDE SQUAD 2 INCLUDES… MEL GIBSON?Over the last few years, Marvel Studios has largely dominated the online news streams, but lately, we’ve been hearing much more from their Distinguished Competition. This week, for example, there were two big news stories concerning two of DC Comics’ biggest upcoming superhero movies. Let’s start with The Batman, the solo movie starring Ben Affleck (presumably) that might be released sometime in 2018. Affleck had been considering directing The Batman himself, but he recently confirmed that he had dropped out. Warner Bros moved on this quickly, announcing&nbsp;late Friday evening that the director now attached to The Batman is Matt Reeves. If, as expected, The Batman does start filming in 2017, it appears likely that it will be Reeves’ sixth film as director, following such genre entries as Cloverfield, the vampire remake Let Me In, and the two most recent Planet of the Apes movies (the latest being War for the Planet of the Apes, scheduled for 7/14/17). [UPDATE: Late Friday night, after this story was published, news broke that talks between director Matt Reeves and Warner Bros have broken down over Ben Affleck’s solo movie, The Batman. The search for a director for this highly-anticipated film continues.] As big as that was, it’s arguable that the news that received the most attention this week involved just Warner Bros’ early short list for a future sequel, namely&nbsp;Suicide Squad 2.&nbsp;That’s because one of the directors mentioned&nbsp;is Mel Gibson, who is very much “hot again” following the critical success of his comeback war movie, Hacksaw Ridge. What is being lost, it seems, in some of the reporting is that Gibson has not landed the Suicide Squad 2 directing gig for certain, and there are several other viable candidates, including&nbsp;Daniel Espinosa (Safe House), Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland), and Jonathan Levine (Warm Bodies). As for how online media is receiving the possible Mel Gibson news, here’s one example.Fresh Developments1. ROBERT DOWNEY JR JOINS RICHARD LINKLATER’S PODCAST-BASED CON MAN COMEDYSome directors like to work repeatedly with the same actors, and Richard Linklater has definitely done that at least twice. The most obvious example is Ethan Hawke, the star of the Before trilogy and Boyhood, but Linklater has also made a few movies with Jack Black (School of Rock, Bernie). With that in mind, we learned this week that Linklater and Robert Downey Jr. — who starred in Linklater’s A Scanner Darkly —&nbsp;have agreed to partner on what might be Linklater’s next film as director. The movie doesn’t have an official title yet, but it’s based on a Reply All podcast episode called Man of the People, and that sure sounds like it could be a movie title. Robert Downey Jr will star in the crime comedy as “Dr. John Brinkley, a charlatan who scams his way to fame using fake medicine, populism, and radio. Dr. Morris Fishbein, editor of the journal of the AMA, begins a quest to take him down as Brinkley becomes more famous — mainly for transplanting goat testicles into humans.” The Reply All podcast about Brinkley aired on 1/19/17, and the recent documentary Nuts! also covered Brinkley’s life.2. MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ JOINS VIOLA DAVIS IN STEVE MCQUEEN’S WIDOWSAlthough every year brings us movies that progress&nbsp;through development with much anticipation, there are others that probably deserve more attention that seem to fly under the radar. This year, one example&nbsp;is Widows, which is director Steve McQueen’s (12 Years a Slave, Hunger) adaptation of a 1983 British TV mini-series. We’ve known for a while that one of the stars of Widows is going to be Viola Davis (along with Cynthia Erivo), but this week, we learned about another female lead. That third actress is Michelle Rodriguez, who appears to taking a break from Fast &amp; Furious movies with this crime story about four widows who team up to complete the heist that killed their criminal significant others.3. LOGAN BREAKOUT STAR DAFNE KEEN MAY GET HER OWN X-23 SPINOFF MOVIEMuch ado has been made about how Logan will be Hugh Jackman’s last movie as Wolverine. While&nbsp;that might be true, it doesn’t necessarily mean&nbsp;that Logan represents the end of the future timeline that it starts (and/or continues). We got an indication of exactly that with the (not yet entirely official) word from director James Mangold that there is a very specific Logan character he wants to make another movie with/about. Speaking about 12-year-old actress Dafne Keen (who plays Laura, AKA X-23, in Logan), Mangold said this week, “I think Dafne is incredible in the film and I would love to see another film about that character and that’s certainly something I’d be involved in.” Of course, as cool as an X-23 movie might be, we’re also left with the quandary of X-23 being yet another character in the X-Men cinematic universe who exists in a different timeline than in the comics. Whereas the Earth-616 version of X-23 is a contemporary teen hero (including a lengthy run in All-New X-Men), it’s quite different from the Mad Max-style future setting of Logan. It’s also worth noting that James Mangold may end up having zero say about whether there is ever a X-23 solo movie. But at least we know someone thinks it’s an awesome idea.4.&nbsp;WESTWORLD STAR THANDIE NEWTON LANDS SECRET ROLE IN HAN SOLO: A STAR WARS STORYAs Lucasfilm continues to flesh out their post-George Lucas backstory with the prequels-that-aren’t-those-prequels, the characters who are cast fall into a few categories. First, there are the famous, de-aged canon characters (Han, Lando, etc), followed by the canon characters we’ve met elsewhere before (and even those, like Sana Starros, are still very much in the “rumor” category). But if the Han Solo prequel plays out like Rogue One: A Star Wars Story did, most of the characters will actually fall in the third category: completely new characters introduced for the first time in that movie. It’s important to know those limitations and precedents, for example, when a story breaks like this week’s news,&nbsp;which reports that Thandie Newton (Mission: Impossible II, HBO’s Westworld) has been cast in a mystery role in the Han Solo prequel (5/25/18). We don’t know who Newton might play, but two possibilities are the mother and/or aunt/stepmom/whatever of either Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) or Emilia Clarke’s character (particularly if you think Clarke is playing Sana Starros). Whoever she’s playing, Newton joins a growing cast that also includes Aldren Ehrenreich (Han Solo), Woody Harrelson, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.5. “THAT’LL DO… DINOSAUR” – BABE STAR JAMES CROMWELL JOINS JURASSIC WORLD 2When he’s not going to extreme lengths to protest in favor of animal rights, actor James Cromwell also appears in a surprising number of “genre movies.” Yes, many know him as the farmer from Babe&nbsp;or LAPD Captain Dudley Smith in L.A. Confidential, but Cromwell has also co-starred in such sci-fi movies as Big Hero 6, Deep Impact, I Robot, Spider-Man 3, and Star Trek: First Contact. Well, we can now add another very popular sci-fi franchise to the list, as Cromwell&nbsp;has now been cast in an unknown role&nbsp;in Universal Pictures’ Jurassic World 2, joining returning cast members Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard alongside franchise newcomers&nbsp;Toby Jones (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) and Justice Smith (Netflix’s The Get Down).&nbsp;Universal Pictures has scheduled&nbsp;the sequel&nbsp;for release on June 22, 2018, which places it in between The Incredibles 2 (6/15/18) and Barbie and the next X-Men movie (both on 6/29/18).6. DOES OSCAR ISAAC JUST WANT TO BE ALONE WITH THE GARBO NETWORK?Every year, the Berlin International Film Festival packs early February with film development stories with potential awards-friendly impact. Even with ten stories a week, it’s still impossible to include every potentially&nbsp;interesting story (this week, we’re offering ten out of a&nbsp;possible 26 news items). One movie that stuck out from the crowd is the World War II thriller called The Garbo Network, in which Oscar Isaac (Inside Llewyn Davis, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) is now attached to star. Isaac will play&nbsp;“Juan Pujol Garcia, an eccentric double-agent who, with no military or covert training, somehow persuaded both the Germans and the British to hire him as a spy. His real allegiance was to England, and working closely with MI5, he created a fictional network of 27 spies said to be spread out over England, Scotland, and Ireland. The ruse helped the English to deceive the Germans about the invasion of Normandy.” Oscar Isaac will soon be working with Steven Spielberg as the title character in The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara, another true story drama with potential to be an&nbsp;awards candidate next year (if Spielberg finishes&nbsp;it in time).7. JARED LETO TO DIREC PATTY HEARST POLICE THRILLER 77For people who were alive in the mid-1970s, the long, strange case of Patty Hearst and the Symbionese Liberation Army may still linger as one of the most memorable events of the decade. In pop culture, however, the legacy of Hearst’s experience is arguably dwindling. Of course, that’s partly because Hearst herself reportedly doesn’t like to discuss that time, preferring instead to focus on her various Westminster Dog Show winners. Meanwhile, American Crime Story: The People vs O.J. Simpson&nbsp;offered recent proof that when it comes to fascinating celebrity cases&nbsp;still make for top tier entertainment,&nbsp;so Paramount Pictures is now in&nbsp;pre-production on a police thriller called 77, about two LAPD officers who team up to “rescue” Patty Hearst from the SLA. The film will be set mostly in 1974, so it’s unclear as to what the 77 of the title refers to (maybe the police code for an ambush?). Paramount has recruited actor Jared Leto to direct 77, in what will be his dramatic feature film directorial debut (having previously directed the documentary Artifact), based on a screenplay by James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and one of his producing partners will be Dick Wolf, famously of the Law &amp; Order TV franchises. It’s not yet known if Leto will also costar in 77.8. STUNNING SUPER BOWL LI WIN SETS UP “DUELING MOVIES” RACETypically when “dueling movies” are announced, only one of the competing projects ends up getting released (Patriots Day was a recent example). Of course, there are plenty of examples to the contrary (Mirror Mirror&nbsp;and&nbsp;Snow White and the Huntsman, Olympia Has Fallen&nbsp;and&nbsp;White House Down, etc). Just over a week after the New England Patriots’ historic surprise comeback at Super Bowl LI, we learned of&nbsp;two different movies based on the game (or the players involved). If you heard only one of them, it was probably the one involving Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. The as yet untitled book and film project will be co-written by three figures behind Patriots Day (also set in Boston), and in addition to focusing on Super Bowl LI itself, the film will reportedly not&nbsp;“shy away from controversy and will include the team’s battle to overcome the Deflategate debacle in 2014, follow Brady’s fall from grace and then his triumphant return to lead the Patriots to his fifth world championship.” With that in mind, the second Super Bowl LI film — ostensibly the underdog here — has an appropriate title: The Secondary. This film will follow a more traditional biopic formula, depicting how New England Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler went from being a small-time Popeye’s frycook to a two-time Super Bowl winner, including the memorable interception versus the Seattle Seahawks during the final seconds of Super Bowl XLIX.&nbsp;The Secondary will be produced by Daniel Levin, whose recent true story drama Lion is currently a multiple Academy Award nominee. Which movie do you think has the better chance of getting made first?ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1. LIAM NEESON TO HAVE PARTICULAR SET OF SNOWPLOW SKILLS IN HARD POWDEREvery year, it gets a little less fun to make up news items for April Fool’s Day (and now more so than ever, with the advent of “fake news” as an online plague). Having said that, Hollywood and the international film community (in particular) continue to produce real movies that sound like April Fool’s Day jokes on paper. For example, one of the best selling movies on the market at this year’s Berlin International Film Festival is an action thriller called Hard Powder, in which Liam Neeson will star as a Rocky Mountains snowplow driver “whose life is up-ended by his son’s killing at the hands of a powerful local drug lord,” sending the “Plow King” on a bloody path of revenge. Filming of Hard Powder will start at locations in Canada in March, 2017. Very often, “Rotten Ideas” are chosen by the Tomatometer scores of those involved, but director Hans Petter Moland‘s films have all tracked well (two of them are at 100 percent). What makes this&nbsp;a Rotten Idea is how&nbsp;absolutely bonkers it sounds. Maybe we’re wrong, and that will be exactly why the movie works. If so, be prepared&nbsp;for a wave of snowplow action movie clones.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Crackle, 24, Fox, Oscars, Academy, IFC, American","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/17144448/Suicide-Squad-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"mel-gibson-in-talks-to-direct-suicide-squad-2-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509188775299","title":"Prepare to Re-Enter The Matrix, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Prepare to Re-Enter The Matrix, and More Movie NewsNetflix will finish an Orson Welles movie, Henry Cavill Joins the IMF, The Fly gets (another) remake, and new roles for Natalie Portman, Alicia Vikander, and Benedict Cumberbatch.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 17, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Aquaman and Venom, a new remake of The Fly, and new roles for Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy and Alicia Vikander.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHERE IS NO SPOON… BUT THERE IS A REBOOT OF&nbsp;THE MATRIXHollywood and pop culture in general has been heavily influenced by the Wachowskis’ 1999 science fiction action movie The Matrix, as evidenced by the many books that have been written about the film.&nbsp;There are elements within The Matrix&nbsp;that could potentially&nbsp;set up a whole franchise beyond just the two disappointing sequels that followed it, and judging by&nbsp;this week’s news, that might&nbsp;actually happen: as you may have heard or read Tuesday night (when social media sort of exploded), Warner Bros is now developing a return to The Matrix. Now, the terminology surrounding this project has been sort of confusing, with&nbsp;some calling it&nbsp;a “reboot,” but The Matrix movies themselves had their own “reboot” right within the story. So this could be a sequel, a prequel, a sidewaysquel, a remake, or all or none of them all at once. Whatever form it ultimately takes, what we do know is that the screenwriter Warner Bros has hired is Zak Penn,&nbsp;whose&nbsp;previous credits include two of the X-Men movies (X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand), as well as some work with Marvel Studios proper (The Avengers, The Incredible Hulk), and Steven Spielberg’s upcoming&nbsp;Ready Player One. Warner Bros is also reportedly interested in recruiting Michael B. Jordan (Creed, Fantastic Four) to star, but it’s unclear who he would play (some speculation has included the next “The One,” or maybe “young Morpheus”). There is no release date as of yet for this new Matrix movie, but March, 2019 will be the month of the film’s 20th anniversary.Fresh Developments1. NETFLIX CAPS OFF A BIG WEEK WITH A NEW MOVIE FROM ORSON WELLES (!)Although some celebrities from Hollywood’s Golden Age are still alive (like Kirk Douglas and Olivia de Havilland), most of them left us so long ago that it’s mindboggling to imagine anyone in Hollywood could be working on a new movie from one of them now. Yet somehow, that’s exactly what happened this week for Citizen Kane director and star Orson Welles. And what company could possibly have the ambition and influence to get something like this done? Why, it’s wunderkind company Netflix, of course, which has announced that they will finish and distribute Welles’ great unfinished film&nbsp;The Other Side of the Wind. Welles worked on the mockumentary project from 1970 to 1976 with directors like John Huston and Peter Bogdanovich contributing to the film, which Wikipedia describes as “a satire of both the passing of Classic Hollywood and the avant-garde filmmakers of the New Hollywood of the 1970s.” Welles was repeatedly met with obstacles in trying to finish The Other Side of the Wind, and only 45 minutes of the film was completed. John Huston starred as a director based on Ernest Hemingway, but Huston also died in 1987, so obviously Netflix and the filmmakers it works with will have to figure out another way to finish the film. If an unfinished Orson Welles movie was Netflix’s only news, this would still be a good week for them, but the streaming giant was on a tear this week. First off, we should note that Netflix now has a new executive in charge of film production, with an eye toward&nbsp;taking an “aggressive” approach to their competition with the other more traditional movie studios. To demonstrate exactly how aggressive Netflix is right now, let’s tick off the other movies they made the news with this week: Tom Hardy is going to star in a Netflix movie called War Party, based on a true story about the Navy SEALs, directed by Andrew Dominik&nbsp;and produced by Ridley Scott. Molly Shannon, Kathryn Hahn, and Paul Giamatti will star in the Netflix comedy Private Life, about a couple struggling with fertility issues. Amy Ryan and Steve Carell have their own Netflix drama in the works called Beautiful Boy, about a teenager’s addiction to meth, and how it impacts his family. And oh, yeah, director Justin Lin (Star Trek Beyond, Fast Five) is going to make a movie called The Stand Off, about a struggle between the police and the Black Panthers. We almost could have given you an entire Weekly Ketchup using only movies to be produced and distributed by Netflix.2. HENRY CAVILL JOINS MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 6 (AND PREPARES&nbsp;FOR DC’S MAN OF STEEL SEQUEL)It’s hardly breaking news, but it’s worth noting that some of Hollywood’s (and, by extension, America’s) biggest movie stars, dating all the way back to the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Cary Grant, are actually, you know, British. Henry Cavill, who plays one of the pop culture icons that most represents “truth, justice and the American way” in movies, is among them, and his&nbsp;Hollywood presence expanded even more this week with the news that he will join the Mission: Impossible ensemble for the franchise’s sixth outing (alongside Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, and Jeremy Renner, all expected to return). Cavill has played Superman in two movies thus far (Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice), and is expected to reprise the role&nbsp;in Justice League (ixnay on “spoilers” for last year’s movie!). Yes,&nbsp;both Man of Steel (55 percent) and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (27 percent) have Rotten Tomatometer scores, but this week’s other news is the potential silver lining that might&nbsp;turn Superman’s Tomatometer scores around someday. That’s because it was reported that Warner Bros’ top choice to direct the Man of Steel sequel is Matthew Vaughn,&nbsp;the British former producing associate of Guy Ritchie who made his directorial debut with Layer Cake before helming three Fresh comic book adaptations: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and 2015’s Kingsman: The Secret Service. Of course, we should note that this doesn’t mean Vaughn will&nbsp;direct the Man of Steel sequel, but even the idea suggests that Warner Bros might be considering a thematic shift away from the darker, Nolan-influenced movies that Zack Snyder has been directing and producing. (A fan can hope, anyway.) Matthew Vaughn also dropped an odd hint on Instagram this week, saying that he is on a mission to get “bigger than Green Lantern,” inspiring writers and fans alike to wonder if this means Green Lantern himself might appear in the Man of Steel sequel.3.&nbsp;AQUAMAN TAKES RELEASE DATE VACATED BY THE DIRECTOR OF (ENTOURAGE‘S) AQUAMANIn season 2 and 3 of HBO’s Entourage, fictional movie star Vincent Chase signs to star in an&nbsp;Aquaman movie&nbsp;to be directed by (real life) director James Cameron. The story arc&nbsp;stretched across so many episodes that it became one of the most lasting ideas to survive the series, even years later. Cameron has been in the news lately for his plans for the Avatar franchise, but he’s most decidedly not directing the&nbsp;Aquaman movie — that honor currently belongs to James Wan (Furious 7, Insidious).&nbsp;Nevertheless, this week’s news continues the tenuous connection between Aquaman and James Cameron, in that Wan’s film has announced&nbsp;a release for the December 21, 2018 release date that was just vacated last week by Cameron’s Avatar 2. As things currently stand, Aquaman is the only WB/DC Comics movie confirmed for release in 2018, but we also heard this week that WB/DC is trying to choose a film that could join Aquaman in 2018. The five projects vying for the slot&nbsp;are The Flash, Gotham City Sirens (the Harley Quinn spinoff), Green Lantern Corps, Justice League Dark (AKA Dark Universe), and the Suicide Squad sequel. All five are&nbsp;at varying degrees of development, but what we still don’t know is which of them is close enough to actually make a 2018 release date. The biggest surprise, though, might be the inclusion of Green Lantern Corps, which had previously been mentioned as a likely 2020 release (and it might still be). Another one of the 2018 possibilities also made the news this week, as Legend of Tarzan screenwriter Adam Cozad signed on to work on the Suicide Squad sequel.4. HOPEFULLY, THE FLY REMAKE WON’T BE A SLEIGHT MISTAKEFilm critics and fans both celebrate the 1980s as a great time for the horror genre. What is sometimes lost in the mix is that a few of the era’s best horror movies were actually remakes, specifically of movies from the 1950s. We’re thinking here of John Carpenter’s The Thing (1982/1951), Chuck Russell’s The Blob (1988/1958), Tobe Hooper’s Invaders from Mars (1986/1953) (regardless of its Tomatometer), and David Cronenberg’s The Fly (1986/1958). Part of the reason why filmmakers wanted to remake movies from the 1950s was that they had access to new SFX and filmmaking techniques that weren’t available 30 years earlier. Likewise, the same argument is no doubt used when justifying remakes today, and it all really came full circle when Carpenter’s The Thing was revisited through a prequel in 2011, also called The Thing. Well, this week, we learned that 20th Century Fox is in talks with director J.D. Dillard (of next month’s Sleight) to direct a new remake of The Fly,&nbsp;about a scientist whose experiments with teleportation lead to him being genetically fused with a housefly. It’s not yet known what direction Dillard is planning to take with the concept of The Fly, but this writer hopes that it is more original than the 2011 The Thing. In addition to The Fly, Dillard is also developing a horror film (starring Kiersey Clemons of Dope) called Sweetheart for Blumhouse (Get Out, The Purge, Insidious).5. MONSTER HUNTER ALICIA VIKANDER SCHEDULED FOR THE FREAKSHIFTEvery once in a while, I come across a news item that really feels like it was lost in the shuffle. This week’s top candidate for that distinction is a supernatural monster action movie called Freakshift, and the reason it’s baffling how little attention it got is because recent “It girl” Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina, The Danish Girl,&nbsp;Jason Bourne) is now in talks to star in the film. This monster hunting actioner will be the next film from director Ben Wheatley, whose career to this point has included genre&nbsp;fare like Kill List and High-Rise, and&nbsp;Freakshift&nbsp;could be his breakout film in the US. If Vikander signs on, she will transition to Freakshift in August after wrapping another ambitious action movie, the reboot of the video game franchise Tomb Raider.6. BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH KNOWS HOW TO STOP TIMEIn Doctor Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marvel superhero learned how to defy the laws of nature by transcending both time and space, and for his newest project, he’s going to defy time again&nbsp;as a man who doesn’t age. Cumberbatch is now attached to star in StudioCanal’s How to Stop Time, based on an upcoming novel (July, 2017) by Matt Haig, and his production company SunnyMarch is also coproducing. Cumberbatch will play “a man who may look like an ordinary 41-year-old but, owing to an extremely rare condition, has been alive for centuries…. [in] …a wildly imagined love story that spans centuries and continents.” How to Stop Time doesn’t currently have a distribution deal in the United States, but it’s a Benedict Cumberbatch sci-fi romance…&nbsp;somebody will pick this movie up. The production also doesn’t have a screenwriter or director attached yet, so it’s probably at least a few years away from happening, too.7. CAN RIDLEY SCOTT HAVE NATALIE PORTMAN FOR ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD?Critics may not love all of his movies (like The Counselor or Exodus: Gods and Kings), but one thing you can’t deny about Ridley Scott is that for a guy pushing 80, he is staying very, very productive. Scott has Alien: Covenant coming out this fall, is also producing Blade Runner 2049 and the Murder on the Orient Express remake, and he also made a deal recently for a Netflix movie (see above). Well, the&nbsp;projects keep coming, and the latest is a fact-based drama&nbsp;called All the Money in the World,&nbsp;based on a “Black List” screenplay chronicling the 1973 kidnapping of J. Paul Getty III. The story will focus on the efforts of his mother to raise the ransom money, with her very, very wealthy father John Paul Getty, Sr. reportedly refusing to pay any&nbsp;of it. Of course, we can read all about the kidnapping on Wikipedia, but it might also be nice to see it adapted by a director like Ridley Scott. Scott’s current focus is on casting the mother role, and after reportedly meeting last week with Angelina Jolie, he’s now hoping to recruit Natalie Portman, who is especially “hot” in Hollywood following the success of&nbsp;Jackie.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. EMILY BLUNT AND HUSBAND JOHN KRASINSKI INVITE YOU TO A&nbsp;QUIET PLACEEmily Blunt (Edge of Tomorrow) has been married to actor John Krasinski (NBC’s The Office) since 2010, but they’ve never worked on a project together. That’s all about to change, because Blunt and Krasinksi are now attached to star opposite each other in a supernatural thriller called A Quiet Place. Krasinksi will also rewrite and direct A Quiet Place, which will be his third film as a director and his first for a major studio (Paramount Pictures). The premise of A Quiet Place isn’t currently known, including whether Blunt and Krasinksi will play a married couple onscreen. Krasinksi’s first two films as director were Brief Interviews with Hideous Men (39 percent) and The Hollars (43 percent), which is why A Quiet Place is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas (but only marginally so).1. MARVEL’S VENOM CREEPS INTO SURPRISE 2018 RELEASE DATEAs Marvel Studios prepares for their 15th film (May’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2), and we’re just two weeks past Fox’s 14th X-Men-related film (Logan), there are still dozens of great characters that are waiting for their shots at cinematic adaptation (like say, Squirrel Girl —&nbsp;just sayin’!). One of Marvel’s most popular characters for the past 25-ish years has been Venom (who actually started life in the comics as the alien symbiote that Spider-Man acquired during 1984’s Secret Wars event). Topher Grace (of TV’s That 70s Show) played the character in 2007’s Spider-Man 3, but that film (and its barely Fresh Tomatometer score) is also blamed by some for ending what could have continued to be a lucrative franchise for both Sony Pictures and director Sam Raimi. Well, next year is Venom‘s 30th anniversary, so maybe we should have seen this coming: Sony Pictures has announced a release date&nbsp;of October 5, 2018 for Venom,&nbsp;claiming that date just as Warner Bros moved Aquaman from October 5th to December 21, 2018 (see above). That’ll be just over a year and a half from now, so it’s possible that Sony can produce a Venom movie by then, but with Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;on the horizon, it’s unclear whether Venom&nbsp;will&nbsp;also be made with Marvel Studios, or if will it exist in its own non-Marvel universe (like their 2018 animated Spider-Man movie about Miles Morales). The Venom screenplay is currently being adapted by writers Scott Rosenberg (Con Air, Gone in Sixty Seconds) and Jeff Pinkner (cowriter of The Amazing Spider-Man 2&nbsp;and the Jumanji reboot, also for Sony). Besides that, we really know very little about the&nbsp;project.&nbsp;This was a week of mostly “pretty good” news, so Venom is this week’s “Rotten Idea,” but again, only marginally so.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Poppins, all-time, Tomatazos, Competition, Channel, Martial, SDCC, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17175232/Matrix-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"prepare-to-re-enter-the-matrix-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509190241673","title":"Ben Affleck Will Not Direct Batman Solo Movie, and More Headlines","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ben Affleck Will Not Direct Batman Solo Movie, and More HeadlinesLeonardo DiCaprio joins a mob drama, Millie Bobby Brown joins Godzilla, The Secret of NIMH gets remade, and Mel Gibson is working again.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 3, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Aquaman, Daddy’s Home 2, Godzilla: King of Monsters, and the remake The Rats of Nimh.This WEEK’S TOP STORYBEN AFFLECK BAILS ON (DIRECTING) THE BATMANFor months and months now, it seemed like every time Ben Affleck was&nbsp;interviewed about his various projects (like, say, Live by Night), the star and director has been grilled about whether he would be directing the inevitable solo movie most sources call The Batman. This week, Affleck confirmed the answer to that question, stating&nbsp;he’s not directing The Batman. Affleck is still signed to play Bruce Wayne and Batman in the solo movie, but he and Warner Bros, “after discussing how to best make the film possible, came to the decision together” for Affleck to hand the reins over to someone else. Or as Affleck put it, “Performing this role demands focus, passion and the very best performance I can give. It has become clear that I cannot do both jobs to the level they require.” Now, what is missing from this news is who exactly Warner Bros might hire to direct The Batman instead. This news inevitably led to many, many stories filled with speculation and conjecture about who might replace Ben Affleck as director. You can find such stories here,&nbsp;here,&nbsp;here, and here. And then of course, there’s this brilliant idea (note: we’re kidding). So, DC Comics fans, who do you think should direct the first solo movie starring Ben Affleck’s version of Batman?Fresh Developments1. LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO STAR IN EARLY MOBSTER DRAMA THE BLACK HANDSome concepts have been so ingrained in pop culture for so long (certainly longer than most of us have been alive) that it’s sometimes helpful to&nbsp;remember what it would have been like when they&nbsp;were new. One&nbsp;genre staple that emerged in the early 20th century was the “gangster” movie, which by the 1970s became synonymous with the Mafia, mostly thanks to Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather. (We should also mention at this point that HBO announced development this week on a movie called Francis and the Godfather.) It’s been a while, though, since we got a movie about the early days of the Mafia (such as The Godfather Part II and Once Upon a Time in America). This week, Leonardo DiCaprio took the subject into his own hands, signing on to star in and produce a movie called The Black Hand. Based on a non-fiction book by Stephan Talty, The Black Hand will tell the story of the origins of the Mafia as an Italian American organized crime network from the perspective of a NYPD cop named Joe Petrosino (who will be played by DiCaprio). Here’s how Variety summed up the premise: “The true story about the origins of the mafia in America follows Joe Petrosino — nicknamed the ‘Italian Sherlock Holmes’ — an NYPD cop who goes after the ruthless gang in the early 190os. The thugs (with the calling card black hand) migrated from Italy to America, and kidnapped people to extort money from their families. They were loathed by law-abiding Italian families who were frightened, but nevertheless helped Petrosino behind the scenes.”2. ELEVEN FROM STRANGER THINGS TO MEET GODZILLA: KING OF MONSTERSEver since the Netflix series Stranger Things became the #2 pop culture sensation of the summer of 2016 (after only Pokemon Go, arguably), there has been an understandable interest in the future careers of a few of the show’s young discoveries. The first movie that will possibly benefit from the Stranger Things ripple effect is this fall’s remake of Stephen King’s IT, but that’s only because Finn Wolfhard had already been cast before Stranger Things had even been released. It was only late last Friday night that we got the first major casting news involving one of the Stranger Things kids. It was then&nbsp;that we learned that Millie Bobby Brown, the 12 year old British actress who played “Eleven,” had closed a deal with Warner Bros to star in Godzilla: King of Monsters (scheduled for release on March 22, 2019). The details of Millie Bobby Brown’s character are not yet known, but there are a few Godzilla precedents we can use for speculation. For one thing, in Toho’s Godzilla films, there are frequently “kid” characters who root for Godzilla in fights against other monsters, so Brown might just be playing the equivalent Hollywood version of that. However (and this is a bit more speculative), there are also the continuing rumors that Godzilla: King of Monsters will introduce at least one new monster, and the one mentioned the most is Mothra. And if Warner Bros is going to make a big Hollywood movie featuring Mothra, and do it right, then they would have to also include the tiny little “fairies” that are directly connected to Infant Island, where Mothra comes from. Could Millie Bobby Brown, already known for her eerie portrayal as Eleven, also be cast as one of the Mothra fairies?3. BIG GREAT STARS VIOLA DAVIS AND JULIA ROBERTS WILL BE IN SMALL GREAT THINGSSunday night, Viola Davis won the SAG Award for Best Supporting Actress for Fences, which might mean she is now the frontrunner to also win the comparable award at the Academy Awards later this month. And within 24 hours, Viola Davis also won a different sort of award, as she (and her agents) “won” a lead role in a new movie called Small Great Things. That film will be based upon a novel by Jodi Picoult (My Sister’s Keeper), and will also costar Julia Roberts. Viola Davis will play a hospital maternity ward nurse who is ordered not to touch the baby of a white supremacist couple (who is then sued by the couple after the baby dies). It’s not yet known who Julia Roberts will play.&nbsp;Small Great Things will be produced by Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners, but the film does not yet have an announced director (or screenwriter).4. MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY TO STAR IN NEW SERENITY MOVIE (WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FIREFLY)Some words just make great titles, and since trademark laws are actually sort of loose about them, some titles inevitably get reused. For example,&nbsp;The Avengers&nbsp;isn’t just the name of a popular Marvel Comics supergroup, but it’s also the title of a British spy TV series (both of which were adapted as movies, separate from each other). With that in mind, there was a popular-but-short-lived 2005 TV series called&nbsp;Firefly&nbsp;that was adapted for the big screen as Serenity, which was extremely popular with its cult fanbase. Unfortunately, some Firefly fans may have gotten prematurely excited this week about Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway starring in Serenity, only to find… it has nothing to do with Joss Whedon or Nathan Fillion. Instead, the Serenity that the two stars are both in talks to join is described as a “sexy noir” about “a fishing boat captain whose past is about to crash up against his life on a small island in the Caribbean, ensnaring him in a new reality that might not be all it seems.”&nbsp;Serenity will be written and directed by Steven Knight, whose films as director have been Redemption and Locke, and as screenwriter, he’s also worked on such films as Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises, and Robert Zemeckis’ recent film, Allied.5. YOU KNOW, IT AIN’T EASY… TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT JOHN &amp; YOKOThis past November marked the 50th anniversary of the meeting of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and April, 2020 will mark the 50th anniversary of the breakup of The Beatles. In between those two dates is well enough time for an enterprising producer to make a movie about exactly those two events, and the events that followed. This week, we learned that producer will be former New Line Cinema executive Michael De Luca, who Variety points out is also one of the producers of the 50 Shades of Grey movies.&nbsp; Michael De Luca is collaborating with Yoko Ono herself on an untitled drama based on the true story of how she met Beatles guitarist John Lennon, and everything else that happened soon after in those turbulent fourteen years (1966-1980).&nbsp; To that end, Michael De Luca has already secured the screenwriting services of Anthony McCarten, who is best known for another romantic true story, The Theory of Everything (about physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife).6. THIS WEEK IN AQUAMAN: VILLAIN BLACK MANTA AND BOTH PARENTS CASTAs we head into the production and filming of the sixth DCEU movie, Aquaman (10/5/18), we are starting to see a trend for the “solo movies,” of which Aquaman is the third, after Man of Steel and Wonder Woman. With all three films, Warner Bros chose well-known female stars to play the hero’s mother: Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, and this week, Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna, Aquaman’s mother. The Nicole Kidman news was the most repeated story of the week for Aquaman, but there were also two other stories, and one of them will probably seem like bigger news when we’ve actually seen the film. First up, Temuera Morrison (AKA Jango Fett from Star Wars Episode II – Attack of the Clones) was also cast this week as Aquaman’s human father. And finally, since everyone else effectively buried the lead, we’ll do the same, with the news of who will play one of Aquaman’s most famous villains. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (from Netflix’s The Get Down) was cast this week as Black Manta, who gets bonus points for having one of the clumsiest looking super villain helmets ever.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. JOHNNY KNOXVILLE TO SPEND DAY AT ACTION PARKOne of the minor trends bubbling up through development at a few studios is the idea of movies based on theme parks, with Disney being the obvious home to a couple, including Magic Kingdom, and other projects based on Jungle Cruise and The Haunted Mansion. The reasons behind any of these projects is obvious: theme parks are lucrative business for their parent companies, so any opportunity to build synergy between the movie and theme park sides of the ledger is encouraged. Having noted that, we have news from Paramount Pictures this week (which doesn’t boast any major theme parks — at least, not any more), which is developing a “theme park comedy” called Action Park. For Action Park, Paramount has solicited the services of their Jackass star, Johnny Knoxville (whose Tomatometer scores are fairly middling when you focus on just non-Jackass starring roles), who will play a man who designs his own theme park along with the help of his friends. Filming of Action Park is scheduled to start next month in South Africa.2.&nbsp;THE SECRET OF NIMH TO BE REMADE AS THE RATS OF NIMHWe don’t have an exact metric on this, but there appears to be some sort of mathematics that Hollywood uses to determine when&nbsp;certain movies are fair game to be remade. We’re now living in the post-Ghostbusters&nbsp;remake era, so a strong argument can be made that at this point, perhaps any popular 1980s movie can be remade under the right circumstances. The (fairly) popular 1982 animated adventure The Secret of NIMH (which benefited from being made by Don Bluth before Disney Animation’s comeback) might be one example. We’ve been hearing for a few years now that MGM (a company itself sort of known for remakes)&nbsp;was working on a new adaptation of the original source material,&nbsp;the&nbsp;1971 children’s book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH by author Robert C. O’Brien. This week, we heard about the firmest movement since The Rats of Nimh entered development, with the news that MGM has hired James Madigan to make his directorial debut with the project. Until now, Madigan has worked as&nbsp;a visual effects supervisor&nbsp;on such films as Van Helsing, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Da Vinci Code, and the two RED movies. This new Rats of Nimh movie is being planned as a hybrid between animation (the rodent/rat characters) and live action (presumably including the farmer of the property where the rats live, and the setting).1. HOLLYWOOD WELCOMES BACK MEL GIBSON… SO HE CAN COSTAR IN DADDY’S HOME 2?When the Academy Award nominations were announced last week, one of the big takeaways was that “Hollywood has officially forgiven Mel Gibson,” who earned a Best Director nomination for Hacksaw Ridge.&nbsp;Put in terms of film development news, that means movies directed by Gibson now have a better chance of being produced by studios again, and that he is once again in the running for mainstream roles. (In the years since his problems in 2006, Gibson has mostly worked “outside the system.”) This week, he made the news twice for potential new projects. Starting off with the “Rotten Idea,” Mel Gibson has officially received an offer from Paramount Pictures to costar in their sequel to the 2015 comedy Daddy’s Home (31 percent Rotten), starring Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell. If Gibson signs on, he will be joining John Lithgow as a new set of fathers to the characters played by Ferrell and Wahlberg (the exact father-son pairings are not yet known). Lithgow was also cast this week in a supporting role in Pitch Perfect 3 (scheduled for 12/22/17). As for that second Mel Gibson, he and Vince Vaughn are both now attached to star in a crime thriller called Dragged Across Concrete. That film, to be directed by S. Craig Zahler (Bone Tomahawk), will tell a timely story of two “cops who are suspended when a video of their strong-arm tactics gets wide attention [who] then descend into the criminal underworld to exact vengeance.”","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"critic, target, and, scary, Carpet, TV, Pacific","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/03172909/Batfleck-Be-Gone-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"ben-affleck-will-not-direct-batman-solo-movie-and-more-headlines"},{"id":"47509190243722","title":"James Cameron and Deadpool Director Tim Miller Will Collaborate on the Next Terminator, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})James Cameron and Deadpool Director Tim Miller Will Collaborate on the Next Terminator, and More Movie NewsStar Wars: Episode VIII gets a title, Illumination announces a trio of sequels, The Flash gets a rewrite, and Every Which Way but Loose gets a remake.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 27, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about Godzilla: King of Monsters, The Predator, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and the remake of Every Which Way But Loose.This WEEK’S TOP STORYNEW TERMINATOR COMING FROM DEADPOOL DIRECTOR AND JAMES CAMERONJames Cameron became famous for his second film, 1984’s The Terminator, and before the mega-blockbuster numbers of Titanic and Avatar (still the #2 and #1 top box office films of all time), Cameron’s biggest hit was the sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This past weekend we learned that after 25+ years, Cameron has now agreed to return to the time-traveling cyborg assassin that he created… sort of. Following the box office flop that was 2015’s Terminator: Genisys ($89 million from a budget of $155 million), the rights to the franchise are expected to revert back to Cameron in 2019, which sounds like a long ways off, but really that’s just two years from now. And it sounds like he&nbsp;fully intends on doing something with those rights, since he will be “godfathering” the sixth Terminator movie, which we now know will be directed by Tim Miller (Deadpool). Miller has also relatively recently signed on to direct the Sonic the Hedgehog movie, and both projects line right up with reports about Deadpool 2, which suggested that Miller departed because he wanted a “bigger” sequel, whereas Ryan Reynolds and 20th Century Fox wanted to keep the first film’s scale (much of which was on just three sets). With the sixth Terminator, Tim Miller can presumably shoot exactly the sort of “big” film to which he aspires. Unfortunately, we don’t know much else about it yet;&nbsp;it might be a total reboot (Bye, Arnold!), a direct sequel (Hi, Arnold?), or both.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI IS THE TITLE OF THIS DECEMBER’S EIGHTH EPISODEAny Star Wars news is big news, even if it’s just the unveiling of a title. With that in mind, it was revealed this week that the movie previously referred to as Star Wars: Episode VIII will, in fact, be called&nbsp;Star Wars: The Last Jedi, leaving us all to speculate for the next 11 months about precisely&nbsp;who the “Last Jedi” is&nbsp;(Luke? Rey? Finn? Kylo? Leia?). It especially doesn’t help that Lucasfilm chose to use “Sith Red” for the iconic&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;logo in the new title art (see above).&nbsp;Star Wars: The Last Jedi is scheduled for release on December 15, 2017.2. ROOM CHILD STAR JACON TREMBLAY JOINS MONSTER MOVIE THE PREDATOR (YES, THAT ONE)There have always been child stars whose films attracted Oscar heat, but 2015 and 2016 was 9-year-old Jacob Tremblay‘s time to shine. The young star of the Oscar-winning drama&nbsp;Room&nbsp;is 10 now, which means that he’s still a couple of years younger than the stars of Stranger Things, but this week, we learned he’ll be facing a monster of his own.&nbsp;It was announced that Tremblay joined&nbsp;the cast of franchise reboot The Predator, to be directed by Shane Black, who co-starred in the first film. We still don’t know much about the the film, except that it’s scheduled for release on February 9, 2018, and that the cast also includes Boyd Holbrook, Olivia Munn, Sterling K. Brown, Keegan Michael-Key, and Thomas Jane.3. FAN FAVORITE DIRECTOR LANDS GODZILLA: KING OF MONSTERSAlthough neither of his two films as director exactly set the box office on fire (indeed, his first film was barely even released theatrically), director Michael Dougherty is something of a fan favorite, if only for Trick ‘r Treat.&nbsp;After that, Dougherty addressed the mythology of Christmas with 2015’s Krampus. For his third film, however, Dougherty is setting holidays aside and following in Colin Treverrow’s footsteps by going big, Big, BIG. It might not even be possible to have, quite literally, a bigger star for his next film, because Michael Dougherty is now signed to direct the next Warner Bros Godzilla movie, which some sources list as&nbsp;Godzilla: King of Monsters. (That title is very similar to Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, which was the title of the 1956 English-language version of the very first 1954 film, Gojira.) We still don’t have many hard facts about this sequel to 2014’s Godzilla, but there has been a lot of speculation that new monsters like Mothra, Rodan, or King Ghidorah may be introduced (hence the “Monsters” in the title). The sequel&nbsp;is scheduled for release on March 22, 2019, and just over a year later on May 29, 2020, it’ll be followed by Godzilla vs Kong, which ties this rebooted franchise in with the big ape debuting this year in Kong: Skull Island (3/10/17).&nbsp;BREAKING: We’ve also just learned, thanks to Variety, that Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown has just closed a deal to star in Godzilla: King of Monsters. Again, we don’t know much beyond that, but it’s the first major casting announcement for the film.4. SEQUELS SING 2, MINIONS 2, AND SECRET LIFE OF PETS 2 ALL DUE BY LATE 2020Illumination Entertainment may have been snubbed in this year’s Academy Awards nominations, but both The Secret Life of Pets and Sing were in last year’s box office top 10 (#4 and #10, respectively). As such, it should surprise absolutely no one that Illumination and parent studio Universal Pictures have plans for sequels to both of them, and in anticipation of this summer’s Despicable Me 3, another Minions movie as well. The first of these three will be Secret Life of Pets 2 on July 3, 2019 (moved back a year from a previous date in 2018).&nbsp;Minions 2 is now scheduled for release on July 3, 2020, and Sing 2 is scheduled for Christmas Day, 2020.5. MICHELLE WILLIAMS JOINS JONAH HILL IN THE MID-90SEver since Warner Bros released The Roaring Twenties in 1939, every decade has experienced some form of cinematic revival. We’re still waiting for people to get all weepy and nostalgic about the 2000s (that will come soon enough, to be sure), but right now, the 1990s are a popular era for reflection (e.g. the current Sundance hit&nbsp;Landline). One filmmaker who is joining those looking back about 20 years is Jonah Hill, who will be making his directorial debut with a movie rather directly called Mid-90s. This week, we learned that Michelle Williams (coming off her Best Supporting Actress nomination for Manchester by the Sea) is now in talks to star in Mid-90s. If she signs, Williams (who herself first came to stardom in the late 1990s TV drama Dawson’s Creek), will play the mother of a Los Angeles teenage boy who finds solace from his troubles in skateboarding. Filming will start in Los Angeles in June, which might be just enough time for Mid-90s to debut at next January’s Sundance Film Festival.6. IS DAISY RIDLEY A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE?Daisy Ridley has kept her agents quite busy since she made her debut in&nbsp;the Star Wars universe with&nbsp;The Force Awakens. In the last year or so, she has signed on for such films as Kenneth Branagh’s Murder on the Orient Express remake (11/22/17), the Hamlet reinterpretation Ophelia, voice work on Peter Rabbit, and a thriller called Kolma. The latest new project for Daisy Ridley is a biopic called A Woman of No Importance. The film will tell the true story of American heiress-turned-spy Sonia Purnell, who, in the years leading up to World War II, worked for the British intelligence unit called SOE. Sonia Purnell was challenged by her potential superiors not just because of her gender, but also because she had lost one of her legs in a hunting accident. So, if you see only one biopic about a one-legged female American World War II spy played by a British actress in the next couple of years… it will almost certainly be A Woman of No Importance.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. ANOTHER WEEK IN THE SLOW MARATHON TOWARDS THE FINISH LINE THAT IS THE FLASHEver since Dope director Rick Famuyiwa departed Warner Bros’ The Flash (starring Ezra Miller, not fan favorite Grant Gustin), it seemed likely that Warner Bros would have to yank it from their 2018 slate. We still haven’t heard confirmation of that (yet), but this week’s news suggests that it is now “super” likely. That’s because Warner Bros has ordered a page one rewrite of The Flash, which means that the hunt for a director is most likely also held back, at least until the new screenplay is delivered in some form for potential directors to consider. The screenwriter that Warner Bros has hired for the job is Joby Harold, whose next two films are both reimaginations of medieval tales: Warner Bros’ King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Charlie Hunnam), and Lionsgate’s Robin Hood (starring Taron Egerton).2. MICHAEL BAY PRODUCING SUPER-TOPICAL DYSTOPIAN ACTION THRILLER LITTLE AMERICAIn tackling this week’s story about an action movie called Little America, we want to stay out of the inherent politics behind the entire thing. Instead, we’ll just point you toward stories like this one and this one, both of which address what we won’t. Apparently, there are people in Hollywood who think right around now would be a good time to start making movies about a dystopian near future specifically set in America. One of those people&nbsp;is producer/director Michael Bay, whom we would love to be able to stop including perpetually in the Rotten Ideas (darn that Tomatometer). Bay will produce a film called&nbsp;Little America&nbsp;after winning the rights in an auction against other companies and producers. The film’s premise portrays the United States&nbsp;“[after the] president has destroyed America’s economic and moral standing in the world to the point that China calls in its loans, making the good old U.S.A. something of a protectorate under China. In this world, a former soldier is asked by a Chinese billionaire to go into one of America’s more dangerous areas to retrieve his missing daughter.”1. RIGHT TURN, CLYDE!&nbsp;EVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE TO GET REMADEThe 1970s were a different time, when the idea of Clint Eastwood starring in a wacky comedy alongside an orangutan didn’t strike anyone as, you know, sort of weird. What’s more, the movie — Every Which Way but Loose — was actually&nbsp;a box office hit, earning nearly $100 million domestically to make it the #4 film of 1978, in between National Lampoon’s Animal House and Warren Beatty’s Heaven Can Wait. James Fargo, who directed Loose and whose debut&nbsp;was the third Dirty Harry movie The Enforcer, &nbsp;is now producing a remake of comedy. The director that Fargo has recruited to realize this dream is Anthony G. Cohen, whose latest film is called The Sex Trip. That movie doesn’t yet have a Tomatometer score, but it does feature the acting talent of Hanks and Stallone (Jim Hanks and Frank Stallone, that is — the brothers of the stars). It’s not yet known if Fargo and Cohen will be casting the brother of Manis the orangutan&nbsp;for this remake, as well.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Film, children's, Comics, teaser, Binge, book, El, TV, screen, Office","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/27170245/Terminator-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"james-cameron-and-deadpool-director-tim-miller-will-collaborate-on-the-next-terminator-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509188777349","title":"Jared Leto May Power Up for Disney’s Tron Reboot, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jared Leto May Power Up for Disney's Tron Reboot, and More Movie NewsTransformers spinoff Bumblebee gets a director, Trolls gets a sequel, Donnie Yen gets Sleeping Dogs, and new roles go to Ryan Gosling and Keanu Reeves.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 3, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Bumblebee, Deadpool 2, Trolls 2, and the third TRON movie.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJARED LETO MAY POWER UP FOR DISNEY’S TRON REBOOTConsidering Jared Leto’s antics during the filming of last year’s Suicide Squad,&nbsp;it’s natural&nbsp;to speculate how far the method actor will go to prepare for any given role.&nbsp;For example, if he landed the lead role in a video game movie, would he do all he could to immerse himself in gamer culture? That is absolutely not an academic question, as the news broke this afternoon that Walt Disney Pictures is now “circling” Jared Leto to possibly star in a new reboot of their TRON franchise. The TRON movies, for those unfamiliar, involve electronic characters inside the world of video games (sort of like Wreck-It Ralph, but more serious). If the project does move on, it would be Disney’s third TRON movie, following the first film in the 1980s (starring Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner)&nbsp;and its direct sequel, TRON: Legacy in 2010 (starring Garrett Hedlund as Bridges’ character’s son). A third movie, then called TRON: Ascension, had reportedly almost started filming in 2015, but it was scrapped soon after&nbsp;filming began. Curiously, director Joseph Kosinski revealed details of that film earlier this week, saying that it wasn’t dead after all and that it was sort of like an “invasion movie.” Today’s news&nbsp;about Jared Leto and the new reboot doesn’t mention&nbsp;anything about the Ascension script being&nbsp;used, although Leto’s “Ares” character reportedly was introduced in Kosinski’s previous screenplay. It’s also not known if Joseph Kosinkski will return to direct this reboot.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;GET OUT STAR DANIEL KALUUYA JOINS VIOLA DAVIS IN WIDOWSWe’re just wrapping up the first week of release for Jordan Peele’s horror movie hit, Get Out, and already, the movie’s star has landed what could be a very plum role. Daniel Kaluuya isn’t a&nbsp;household name yet, but as the lead character in Get Out, he’s in a great position to raise his profile. Although he plays an American in Get Out, Kaluuya is actually British, so it probably isn’t&nbsp;a huge surprise that the director who has recruited Kaluuya for his next big film is another Brit, namely Steve McQueen (Hunger,&nbsp;12 Years a Slave), who has cast Kaluuya&nbsp;in his&nbsp;adaptation of the British miniseries Widows. The title refers to the wives who are left behind when a gang of criminals (possibly including Kaluuya’s character) are killed while trying to pull off a heist. The four title characters are expected to be Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki, and Cynthia Enrivo. If Daniel Kaluuya is going to play one of the killed criminals, it’s not yet known which of the Widows will be his.2. WILL THE DEADPOOL SEQUEL BE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BY ONE OF THE STARS OF STRANGER THINGS?It’s now been over a year since Deadpool (or specifically, its post-credits tease) sent us all a-speculating about who might be cast as Cable, Marvel’s popular time-travelling soldier, and we’re still not much closer to an answer, despite rumors that alternately named&nbsp;Stephen Lang (Avatar), Liam Neeson, Pierce Brosnan, Kyle Chandler, and apparently Michael Shannon (who recently dropped out of contention). The latest actor to make the news is David Harbour, the character actor who played supporting roles in projects like HBO’s The Newsroom,&nbsp;Black Mass, and&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;before his turn&nbsp;as Police Chief Hopper in Netflix’s massively popular&nbsp;Stranger Things.&nbsp;Reportedly, Harbour is currently being “eyed” to play Cable in the Deadpool sequel (which might be called Deadpool &amp; Cable), and he’s recently been screen-tested by Fox.3. PREPARE THE SPARKLE FART CANNONS!&nbsp;TROLLS 2 SCHEDULED FOR APRIL, 2020When one&nbsp;reflects on the animated box office hits of 2016, the most obvious winners were Finding Dory, The Secret Life of Pets, Zootopia, Sing, and Moana. Having noted that, DreamWorks also scored a fairly decent hit with November’s Trolls, with its global take currently at $340+ million off a budget of $125 million. That was apparently enough to satisfy DreamWorks and their new corporate owners at Universal Pictures, because this week, the two studios announced their plans for a Trolls sequel. The first film’s two voice cast leads, Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick, are both already signed to reprise their colorful roles in the sequel, but no other details are currently known. Universal has scheduled Trolls 2 for release on April 10, 2020, which is one week after the current release dates for the DC Comics superhero movie Cyborg&nbsp;and a mystery title from DreamWorks’ animation competition, Sony Animation.4. TRANSFORMERS SPINOFF BUMBLEBEE LANDS KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS DIRECTORThe winner of this year’s Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was Disney’s Zootopia, but the director of one of its main competitors for that prize was one of the first figures to “win” a new job after the ceremony this week. (See also: the Ryan Gosling story that follows!) That director is Travis Knight, the CEO of stop-motion animation company Laika Pictures, who also made his directorial debut with Kubo and the Two Strings. Although, after four movies (including Coraline, Boxtrolls, and ParaNorman), Laika has yet to have its own major box office success, the firm’s reputation appears to have helped Knight transition into working directly on a major Hollywood film for his second directorial feature. Knight has landed the plum job of directing the Transformers spinoff about yellow robot Bumblebee, making him the first director to work on the franchise who’s not Michael Bay. The fifth film from Laika (which is still shrouded in mystery) is scheduled for release on May 18th, 2018 (up against the Slender Man horror movie).5. LA LA LAND STAR RYAN GOSLING FIRES UP THE UNDERWATER WELDERThe musical drama La La Land may have won the most Academy Awards Sunday night (six, including Best Director and Best Actress), but in a bizarre twist (as you may have heard), it will probably always be remembered as the movie that won-but-didn’t-actually-win Best Picture. The last-minute Oscar mixup so dominated the news cycle this week that it’s easy to overlook the fact that there was another La La Land loser: Ryan Gosling (Casey Affleck won Best Actor for Manchester by the Sea instead). That said, Gosling was the star who most benefited in terms of landing a new film project (though he surely won’t be the last). That’s not entirely a random happenstance, however, as his&nbsp;new project is one that he’s coproducing himself (and indeed, he has not yet actually attached himself to the film as an actor). Ryan Gosling is producing an adaptation of the graphic novel called The Underwater Welder. If he&nbsp;does eventually sign on to star in the film,&nbsp;he would be playing, well, an underwater welder who has a bizarre, supernatural encounter at the bottom of the sea. The timing of this news is also interesting because just last week, Kristen Stewart also made headlines when it was revealed she was&nbsp;in talks to star in the similarly-titled disaster movie&nbsp;Underwater.6. KEANU REEVES GOES TO THE BIRDS FOR HIS NEXT MOVIE, THE STARLINGKeanu Reeves’ filmography has become so associated with action movies (Speed,&nbsp;The Matrix,&nbsp;John Wick)&nbsp;that it’s easy to forget he’s done a fair share of romantic films, too (The Lake House, Something’s Gotta Give, A Walk in the Clouds). For his next film, he’s taking another break from all the shooty/punchy/kicky stuff and starring instead in a romantic drama about struggling with loss&nbsp;called The Starling, in&nbsp;which he’ll play a grieving man harassed by&nbsp;an annoying bird. Isla Fisher (Wedding Crashers) will costar as a woman who checks into recovery after her child dies, and Reeves will play her husband, who “decides to build a beautiful garden for his wife in their backyard, but as he does he is tormented by an aggressive, black starling. At his wits end with the relentless nature of the bird, he goes to see a veterinarian to find out if there is a humane way to get rid of it. The vet, the husband finds out, used to be a psychiatrist but gave it up to help animals instead. However, the quirky vet begins counseling the husband in a turn that neither of them really expected.” (Hopefully, that premise didn’t take us all the way to the end of the movie.)&nbsp;The Starling will be the English language debut of Finnish director Dome Karukoski,&nbsp;whose films have previously won a series of festival awards.7.&nbsp;MINDY PROJECT COSTAR FORTUNE FEIMSTER SELLS BAD COP, BAD COP BUDDY COMEDYThe long line of successful heavy-set male comedians dates all the way back to the days of “Fatty” Arbuckle, Lou Costello, and Oliver Hardy, who paved the way for stars like John Candy, Chris Farley, and Jonah Hill. Only recently has the same success found their female counterparts, with Melissa McCarthy (Bridesmaids), Rebel Wilson (Pitch Perfect), and others headlining their own hits on the big screen. The next comedienne who might be on the verge of movie stardom is Fortune Feimster, who is currently known for her recurring role on Hulu’s The Mindy Project. Feimster, a longtime writer for Chelsea Lately,&nbsp;has been working hard to “break through” on her own, having already sold three different TV pilots. This week, she&nbsp;made her biggest comedy movie pitch sale to DreamWorks Pictures, who picked up the rights to a police action comedy called Bad Cop, Bad Cop, with Feimster attached to star; it’s not yet known if she will play the first Bad Cop&nbsp;or the second Bad Cop. In addition to this major studio comedy, Feimster has also recently filmed roles in indie comedies called Deported and F*cking People.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. CAN RAZZIE WINNER JADEN SMITH “HELP” CARA DELEVIGNE WIN HERS NEXT YEAR?Although her first film (2012’s Anna Karenina) did receive a borderline Fresh Tomatometer score, Cara Delevingne’s six movies since then (including Pan and Suicide Squad) have all received Rotten scores. Despite that streak, Delevingne has thus far not received any nominations yet from the Razzies (AKA the Golden Raspberry Awards), the organization devoted each year to shining a spotlight on the most Rotten roles and films of the year. Jaden Smith, on the other hand, did win two Razzies in 2014 for his exercise in nepotism, After Earth, the box office bomb he costarred in with his famous dad, Will Smith. Though he had a supporting role in Netflix’s The Get Down, Jaden&nbsp;hasn’t appeared in a movie since After Earth —&nbsp;that’s going to change soon, thanks to Will Smith’s production company, Overbrook Entertainment. Jaden Smith and Cara Delevingne are both now attached to star in a romantic drama called Life in a Year. Delevingne (age 24) will play&nbsp;a teenager who finds out she has just one year to live, so her boyfriend (Smith) sets out to fill that year with the equivalent of a whole lifetime together. Life in a Year will be the English language debut of Slovenian director Mitja Okorn, whose previous films have not yet received Rotten Tomatoes scores.1. DONNIE YEN (ROGUE ONE) CAST IN VIDEO GAME ADAPTATION SLEEPING DOGSBy this point, video game adaptations are sort of like Charlie Brown’s football to movie fans who regularly follow film development news. Every year, we hear about some promising new adaptation&nbsp;(Michael Fassbender in Assassin’s Creed, for example), and inevitably upon its release, the movie will earn a Rotten Tomatometer, the way video game movies usually do. You’d think Hollywood would have figured it out by now, but it’s such an undeniable trend that no amount of great talent is any guarantee that the film won’t end up Rotten. Take, for example, Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen, who has long been a top choice for many fans to get his chance at proper Hollywood stardom. He’s slowly getting there, with a featured role in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&nbsp;and another recently in xXx: Return of Xander Cage, but even so, at 53, Yen continues to land mostly supporting roles. So from one perspective, it might have been great news this week that Yen landed the lead role in a movie that might be the start of a new action franchise. That is, until you remember that the reason you know the title Sleeping Dogs is because it was a cross-platform video game in 2012, forcing you to apply the aforementioned “video game curse” to the news. Assuming&nbsp;the movie follows the premise of the game, Donnie Yen will star as a San Francisco cop who is transferred to Hong Kong to infiltrate a Triad gang called the Sun On Yee.&nbsp;Sleeping Dogs appears to also be the latest project in the recent trend of Hollywood films with heavy connections to China, though this isn’t exactly great news, since recent examples of China/Hollywood collaborations include both Warcraft and The Great Wall. Some of the same producers behind this Sleeping Dogs movie are also actively developing the Sonic the Hedgehog video game adaptation (from Deadpool director Tim Miller).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Golden, transformers, National, Network, A24","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/03181351/Letotron3000.jpg","slug":"jared-leto-may-power-up-for-disneys-tron-reboot-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509190247820","title":"Peter Dinklage in Talks for Key Role in Avengers: Infinity War, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Peter Dinklage in Talks for Key Role in Avengers: Infinity War, and More Movie NewsThe Onion gets a trilogy, Will Smith joins Disney's live-action Dumbo, Vin Diesel hints at another XXX, and Martin Scorsese's Frank Sinatra biopic is kaput.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 13, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Avengers: Infinity War, Dumbo, Green Lantern Corps, The Onion (yes, that Onion), and Shazam.This WEEK’S TOP STORYPETER DINKLAGE IN TALKS FOR KEY ROLE IN AVENGERS: INFINITY WARWith reports emerging this week that filming will start on location in Scotland next month, it’s not at all surprising that we heard about Avengers: Infinity War casting. First, Peter Dinklage (AKA Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones) is in early talks for a “key role.” And that, right there, is all that we know about it. That aura of mystery sent various comic book-related websites into a frenzy of speculation, as you can see here, here, and, oh yeah, here. Dinklage is on the short side, so obviously some of the guesses included the likes of Puck, M.O.D.O.K., and Pip the Troll, but in the past, Dinklage has often favored roles that were not “height specific” (such as his role as Bolivar Trask in X-Men: Days of Future Past). Other guesses included “cosmic” characters like the Beyonder, Eternity, the Gardener, the Living Tribunal, Order or Chaos, and Uatu the Watcher. Of all the possible roles he&nbsp;might play in Avengers: Infinity War, this writer is going to guess it could be Starfox, a (relatively) long time member of the Avengers in the 1980s, who also happens to be the brother of Thanos. Anyway, yes, filming of Avengers: Infinity War starts soon-ish, and Marvel Studios has scheduled the film for May 4, 2018, and its untitled sequel for a day shy of a year later, on May 3, 2019. Returning&nbsp;to the news about filming in Scotland, one of the details that was sort of buried in that story was the revelation that Liv Tyler will be costarring in Avengers: Infinity War. If it turns out to be true, it almost certainly means that Tyler will be returning to the MCU after an absence so long that many people might not even remember she was ever in it. If you still can’t remember, you might also have not seen The Incredible Hulk, in which Tyler played Bruce Banner’s girlfriend Betsy Ross (AKA Red She Hulk in the comics).Fresh Developments1. WILL SMITH (AND HIS EARS) MAY STAR IN DISNEY’S LIVE-ACTION DUMBOLet’s be completely honest here: some movie stars have big ears. Some have big noses, some have big heads, and some have big ears. Clark Gable, for example, had ears so big, that when he appeared in cartoons, he was caricatured like this. Among today’s movie stars, one whose lobes cast long shadows in profile is Will Smith. (Googling “Will Smith Ears” will give you results like this&nbsp;and this). With that in mind,&nbsp;Will Smith is reportedly now in early talks with Walt Disney Pictures to star in their live-action remake of the studio’s fourth animated feature, 1941’s Dumbo. Tim Burton, who recently directed the biopic Big Eyes, is attached to helm the movie, about a baby elephant whose life in the circus is made more difficult by the size of his ears (and the cruel treatment of his mother). If Smith signs on, he will play a father whose children develop a friendship with Dumbo. Tom Hanks has also reportedly been offered the role of the film’s villain, but the filming schedule of Dumbo may conflict with another film he’s considering, a World War II drama called The Grey Hound. Speaking of scheduling conflicts, there are also stories suggesting that if Will Smith does sign on for Dumbo, it could mean scheduling problems for Sony’s two planned Bad Boys sequels planned for 2018 and 2019.2.&nbsp;GREEN LANTERN CORPS CONFIRMED TO BE A (SPACE) COP BUDDY MOVIEThis was sort of a slow news week, so we’re admittedly filling this column out with a few fluffier stories that might not have made the cut in a busier week. For example, ever since WB and DC announced plans for a movie called Green Lantern Corps, it’s always been fairly obvious that there would be multiple “Green Lanterns” in the movie, and yet, here we are, reporting just that. Confirmation came this week that Green Lantern Corps will focus on the space adventures of both Hal Jordan and John Stewart, the African American character best known for costarring in the animated shows Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. &nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter also posted this handy guide to John Stewart for those less familiar with the character. As for who might play John Stewart in the Green Lantern Corps movie, Sterling K. Brown has already come right out and said, “I humbly submit my name.”3. DWAYNE JOHNSON PROMISES DC COMICS MOVIES MIGHT SOMEDAY BE “FUN”Three movies in, thus far, Warner Bros’ current slate of DCEU movies are pretty darn glum. Metropolis was half-obliterated in Man of Steel, Superman and Batman came to blows in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and Suicide Squad featured the wholesale massacre of citizens (temporarily) turned into blobby zombies. We’ve known for years now that WB (and previously, New Line Cinema) has long-term plans for a Shazam movie about the original character called Captain Marvel (before Marvel’s… it’s a long story). DC’s Shazam (which has to be called that because Marvel Studios has the rights to the title Captain Marvel) has been, for decades, a paragon of optimism and hope and FUN. The one movie star who has long been associated with the Shazam movie is Dwayne Johnson, and this week, in what seemed like it might have been encouraged by the studio, Johnson took to Facebook to make a statement&nbsp;about a recent meeting with DC, which we know was about him playing Black Adam in Shazam, because he used #BlackAdam. Johnson’s statement went like this: “Had a very cool and strategic meeting with the heads of DC Comics about their entire universe. As a hard core DC fan, to get a real sense of the tonal shifts and developments coming in these future movies has me fired up. Something we, as DC fans have all been waiting for. Hope, optimism &amp; FUN. I’m excited about our future together and you should be too. Even when talking about the the most ruthless villain/anti-hero of all time finally coming to life. Prepare yourselves DC Universe.” There is still no official release date (or a director, even) for WB’s Shazam.4. HAS TARAJI P. HENSON LEFT A GOOD JOB IN THE CITY FOR PROUD MARY?In what may have been surprising box office news, the space race true story Hidden Figures this past weekend became the first movie to unseat Rogue One: A Star Wars Story from the top of the domestic box office charts. As a potential reaction to that news, one of the stars of Hidden Figures landed a new movie project this week as well. Taraji P. Henson (also from TV’s Empire) has signed a deal with Sony’s Screen Gems to star in a thriller called Proud Mary, about&nbsp;a female assassin “whose life is upturned when she meets a young boy who awakens the maternal instinct she never knew she had.”5. FAKE NEWS SOURCE THE ONION MAKES REAL MOVIE NEWSLong before the 2016 presidential news cycle gave “fake news” a bad name, The Onion was&nbsp;delivering truly false news stories. There has been talk in the past about The Onion expanding into movies, but all that seemed to come out of it was the 2008 direct-to-video release The Onion Movie. Well, now that everyone (even the President Elect!) is talking about “fake news,” the Chicago-based satire publication&nbsp;appears poised to try once again to spread their special brand of news fakery to your local cineplex. That’s because The Onion has signed a three-picture deal with Lionsgate. We don’t yet know what those three movies might be about, but the deal only extends to the year 2018 (ie, next year), so if Lionsgate is going to do something with their new property, we should hear (relatively) soon.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4. MATT DAMON AND BEN AFFLECK TO SET ASIDE SOME FATHER DAUGHTER TIMEOnce upon a time, Matt Damon considered&nbsp;making his directorial debut with a Warner Bros movie called Father Daughter Time, but he eventually dropped out. That film is also known by the much longer title of Father Daughter Time: A Tale Of Armed Robbery And Eskimo Kisses, but that subtitle is probably something just added to the screenplay’s title page that was never intended to be the real title. This week, we learned that the new director of Father Daughter Time will be Gavin O’Connor, whose most recent film was the Rotten action thriller The Accountant. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are both attached to produce Father Daughter Time, but there’s no word yet as to whether either of them might play the titular father. Only one of Gavin O’Connor’s last four films as director received a Fresh Tomatometer score, which is why we’re calling this one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.3. VIN DIESEL IS ALREADY TALKING UP THE FOURTH XXX MOVIE (XXXX?)We’re still a week away from the January 20th release of xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, but its star Vin Diesel is already talking about a sequel. While at the film’s London premiere this week, Vin Diesel recounted a recent story, saying that while doing an interview, he was asked by Paramount executive Brad Grey whether “everyone” could come back for filming the fourth film in May (2017). That is… pretty much all there is to this story. We’re calling this one a “Rotten Idea” (despite not knowing how high a&nbsp;Tomatometer score the third movie will earn) if only because the first two were indeed both Rotten.2. WILL YOU BE ON ANNA KENDRICK’S NICE OR NAUGHTY LIST IN CHRISTMAS MOVIE NICOLE?Over the last several years, Christmas movies have featured a few variants on Santa Claus. There was Tim Allen’s contractually obligated replacement in the Santa Clause movies, 2011’s Arthur Christmas (about Santa’s son), and 2007’s Fred Claus, starring Vince Vaughn as Santa’s brother. Those movies are obviously very male-centric, however, which leads us to the next obvious Santa replacement concept, which we can easily imagine being pitched like this: “What if Santa had a daughter?”&nbsp;Pitch Perfect star Anna Kendrick is now in talks to star in Nicole&nbsp;as exactly that character, who is forced to take over the family business after Santa retires and her brother gets “cold feet” on Christmas Eve. (We should note that the Nicole title is tentative, with some sources saying the movie is currently untitled.) This “daughter of Santa” comedy is based at Walt Disney Pictures and was written by screenwriter Marc Lawrence, whose Tomatometer has lots and lots of Rotten splotches, which is why this is one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas.”1. MARTIN SCORSESE WON’T BE ABLE TO DIRECT THE FRANK SINATRA BIOPIC “HIS WAY” (OR ANY WAY)For movie fans who follow movie development news like their own personal dreams of movies they’d like to see someday, it’s possibly always been fun to imagine what films Martin Scorsese&nbsp;might take on. One project that Scorsese has been trying to get going for many years now is&nbsp;a biopic about famed Italian crooner Frank Sinatra. The appeal for Scorsese is obvious on many levels, including the fact that Sinatra was Italian-American, and like Howard Hughes (The Aviator), his shadow stretched across half the 20th century (including the movies). Well, it appears that the dream of a Martin Scorsese-directed Sinatra biopic will have to stay exactly that, because this week, Scorsese was quoted as saying that he can’t make the movie. Here’s what he said: “We can’t do it!… I think it is finally over. They (remaining members of the Sinatra clan) won’t agree to it. Open it up again and I’m there! Certain things are very difficult for a family, and I totally understand. But, if they expect me to be doing it, they can’t hold back certain things. The problem is that the man was so complex. Everybody is so complex — but Sinatra in particular.” The news that we’ll probably never get to see this promising biopic is even worse than hearing someone with a lot of Rotten Tomatometer scores is making a movie, so it’s the Rotten Idea of the Week.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"singing, Ellie, National, Alien, rotten, twilight, thriller, killer, &, school, TV, your, sag, police","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/13164716/Peter-Dinklage-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"peter-dinklage-in-talks-for-key-role-in-avengers-infinity-war-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509191657877","title":"X-Force to Debut in Deadpool 3, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})X-Force to Debut in Deadpool 3, and More Movie NewsDumbledore set to appear in Fantastic Beasts 2, Rami Malek will star in a Freddie Mercury biopic, Now You See Me 3 is greenlit, and Max Landis wants to redo An American Werewolf in London.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 11, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Deadpool 3, Justice League, and Now You See Me 3.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHE X-MEN MOVIE SHAKEUP INCLUDES X-FORCE DEBUTING IN DEADPOOL 3When Jennifer Lawrence was cast as Rebecca Romijn’s replacement in early 2010 in the prequel X-Men: First Class, her breakout indie hit Winter’s Bone was several months from release, and The Hunger Games was over two years away as well. Michael Fassbender had been in 300 and Inglourious Basterds, but he was far away from being a household name. So really, of the film’s three leads, James McAvoy was the biggest “name,” and even so, that was mostly because of Wanted (and to a less degree, Atonement and The Last King of Scotland). Nicholas Hoult, was still “the kid from About a Boy,” some five years before Mad Max: Fury Road. Starting with X-Men: First Class, 20th Century Fox signed these four rising stars to three film contracts, which after X-Men: Days of Future Past and X-Men: Apocalypse, have now been fulfilled. Next, consider that&nbsp;Fox saw a steep $204 million drop from X-Men: Days of Future Past ($748 million worldwide) to&nbsp;X-Men: Apocalypse ($544 million). These (and Hugh Jackman being done with Wolverine after next year’s Logan) were all factors in the news this week that 20th Century Fox is now considering&nbsp;some form of reboot for the X-Men franchise. What exactly that might be is still unclear, but for the time being, it appears that Fox is going to focus on the spinoff YA title The New Mutants, and what is quickly becoming a Deadpool-centric franchise of its own.&nbsp;Deadpool 2 is still several months away from filming, and already, Fox is working on plans for Deadpool 3. The studio is reportedly planning on combining their long-in-development X-Force movie with Deadpool 3, although which characters it might include are still unknown. Colossus, who appeared in Deadpool, has been an X-Force member, and X-Force members Cable and Domino are both confirmed to make their debuts in Deadpool 2. Beyond that, a few of the New Mutants (such as Cannonball, Mirage, Sunspot, and Wolfsbane) went on to be members in the comics of X-Force (which actually started as a direct spin-off of The New Mutants). There is no release date for The New Mutants or Deadpool 3, but the former might make it in 2018, and the latter probably won’t be released until 2020 at the earliest. It’s not yet known if X-Men: Apocalypse additions like Alexandra Shipp, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Tye Sheridan, and Sophie Turner will remain if Fox does reboot the X-Men franchise.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;DUMBLEDORE TO APPEAR IN FANTASTIC BEASTS 2 (AND J.K. ROWLING HINTS AT SOMETHING ELSE…)There are sometimes different ways to interpret movies, such as what they present versus what one of the creators might state outside of what the film depicts. For example, you can watch all eight of the Harry Potter movies, and the sexuality of Professor Albus Dumbledore is never explicitly addressed. However, anyone who was following the Harry Potter franchise while those movies were being made probably heard in 2007 that J.K. Rowling stated, “Dumbledore is gay.” Specifically, Rowling said that Dumbledore fell in love with his rival wizard, Gellert Grindlewald, although she never said that Grindlewald necessarily returned Dumbledore’s romantic affections. We mention all of this because this week, J.K. Rowling seemed to hint that the younger Dumbledore might be more openly gay than we’ve seen in the Harry Potter movies. That statement came a few days after it was reported that casting is currently underway for the young Albus Dumbledore&nbsp;to appear in the second Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, to be released on November 16, 2018. The final element about all of this was also filled in this week, with the confirmation from director David Yates that the character the recently cast Johnny Depp will play in the sequel is none other than the previously mentioned wizard Gellert Grindlewald.2. NEW SPIDER-MAN TOM HOLLAND SIGNED FOR SIX MARVEL STUDIOS MOVIESIn the past, we’ve heard about the long contracts that some of the Marvel Studios stars have had to sign. For example, we know that at least two of their stars signed for nine movies each: Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury), and Sebastian Stan (Winter Soldier). Other Marvel Studios stars have shorter contracts, such as six movies each for Chris Evans (Captain America), Chris Hemworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki) and Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk); five movies for Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther), and Robert Downey Jr (Iron Man), who only signs for each additional movie separately. (You can also read another slightly more up-to-date review of their contracts here). This week, we learned of another lengthy multi-film Marvel Studios contract, and the details of it provided us with some interesting new hints:&nbsp;Tom Holland, who made his debut as Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War, signed on for six Marvel Studios films. That package includes three solo movies, starting with Spider-Man: Homecoming (7/7/17), which&nbsp;leads to some fairly limiting math, because that means Tom Holland is only signed to play Spider-Man in two more MCU movies that aren’t his own. Presumably, those two films might be Avengers: Infinity War (5/4/18), and the untitled fourth Avengers movie (5/3/19). So, if anyone was hoping maybe Spider-Man would be appearing in other MCU movies like Ant-Man and the Wasp, or Captain Marvel, the math suggests that he won’t be (unless Marvel Studios signs a new contract down the road, which isn’t impossible).3.&nbsp;JESSICA CHASTAIN TO STAR IN COMIC BOOK MOVIE PAINKILLER JANEThe continued box office domination of the superhero movies of Marvel Studios and Warner Bros arguably has led people to think of them as being synonymous with “comic book movies.” Technically, though, comic book movies are less a genre than just a type of source material (such as remakes, and movies based on TV shows, books, etc). Indeed, if one goes back several years, you can actually find years where most “comic book movies” were not, strictly speaking, “superhero movies.” For example, in the year 2001, none of the major comic book adaptations (Ghost World, From Hell, Ichi the Killer, Josie and the Pussycats) were “superhero movies.” One such non-superhero comic book title is Event Comics’ Painkiller Jane, who is more of a Punisher-style vigilante (who happens to have the ability to heal really quick, but no traditional “super powers”).&nbsp;Painkiller Jane has been adapted in the past, first as a 2005 TV movie, and then in 2007 as a TV series&nbsp;(in both cases, these productions were for SyFy). A full-fledged Painkiller Jane movie might still happen, however, with the news this week that Jessica Chastain is now attached to produce and star in a theatrical adaptation of Painkiller Jane. Although she has indeed costarred in such genre titles as Crimson Peak, Huntsman: Winter War, Interstellar, and The Martian, it somehow still seems unusual for Chastain to sign on for a revenge thriller like Painkiller Jane. It’s not yet known who will direct&nbsp;Painkiller Jane.4.&nbsp;ROBOT STAR RAMI MALEK TO PORTRAY FREDDIE MERCURY IN BOHEMIAN RHAPSODYAmong the rock stars who continue to elude “biopic” treatment (such as Janis Joplin and Elton John), one whose biopic has been in development the longest is Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.&nbsp; If you’ve heard, in the past, about a Freddie Mercury biopic, it might have been back when Sacha Baron Cohen was attached to star (before he eventually departed the project). That biopic, now called Bohemian Rhapsody, appears to be getting closer to production, with the news this week of the film’s star. Rami Malek, who is probably best known for starring in the TV series Mr. Robot (he also costarred in HBO’s The Pacific), is now attached to star in that film as Freddie Mercury. We can also report that frequent X-Men director Bryan Singer is in talks to direct Bohemian Rhapsody, with filming expected to start in early 2017 (making this Singer’s first film after this year’s X-Men: Apocalypse).&nbsp;Bohemian Rhapsody was adapted by screenwriter Anthony McCarten, whose other projects include&nbsp;The Theory of Everything, and next year’s Darkest Hour, featuring Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill.5.&nbsp;DOWNTON ABBEY STAR DAN STEVENS WILL PLAY THE MAN WHO INVENTED CHRISTMASA lot&nbsp;of the holiday traditions that we take for granted in 2016 didn’t even really exist in, say, 1816 or even (for some holidays), in 1916. This week, we learned of an upcoming British film which will address how one man in 1843 arguably changed or popularized the customs of Christmas, defining much of what we now associate with the holiday. Dan Stevens, Christopher Plummer, and Jonathan Pryce are all now signed to star in The Man Who Invented Christmas, about author Charles Dickens’ (Stevens) authoring of the popular novel A Christmas Carol. Dan Stevens is probably best known for starring as Matthew Crawley in the first three seasons of Downton Abbey (he’s also going to be “the beast” in next year’s live action Disney remake of Beauty and the Beast). Christopher Plummer will play Ebenezer Scrooge (it’s unclear if he will be a “real” character or one imagined by Dickens), and Jonathan Pryce will play Dickens’ father. Filming of The Man Who Invented Christmas is scheduled to begin&nbsp;next month, in time for a holiday season release in late 2017.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4.&nbsp;CIARAN HINDS TO PLAY STEPPENWOLF IN JUSTICE LEAGUEIf you are a superfan of this year’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, you may have seen the deleted scene many fans and commentators have interpreted as teasing the introduction of Steppenwolf, one of the New Gods villains most associated with DC Comics “big bad” Darkseid. Well, this week, that hint was confirmed with the news that Steppenwolf will indeed be the main villain in next year’s Justice League. That confirmation came via the news that Ciaran Hinds (aka Mance Rayder from Game of Thrones) will be the actor playing Steppenwolf. The timing of this revelation was unusual because it actually came out after filming of Justice League recently wrapped (it’s usually the case that we learn these things weeks or even months before filming starts). We’re calling this a “Rotten Idea” because Justice League will be another DC Comics movie directed by Zack Snyder, and his Tomatometer has been nothing but Rotten splotches the last seven years (2010 to 2016). Warner Bros has scheduled Justice League for release on November 17, 2017, two weeks after Marvel’s Thor: Ragnarok (November 3, 2017).3.&nbsp;NOW YOU SEE ME 3… WILL THEY FINALLY SAY NOW YOU DON’T?There is no denying that Lionsgate had a legitimate box office hit with 2013’s magician-caper Now You See Me, earning over $350 million worldwide from a budget of just $75 million. The sequel, however, earned just $65 million domestically, though it did come just $17 million shy in worldwide grosses. So, as a “franchise,” Now You See Me is sort of like Warcraft, with the domestic grosses of the 2016 film being much less, proportionately, than the international numbers. We’ve known for a while now that Lionsgate was planning a third film set in China with a mostly Chinese cast, which is now confirmed to be more of a spinoff than a direct sequel. That leads us to this week’s news, which is that Lionsgate is now developing a proper Now You See Me 3, which will effectively be the fourth film of the franchise. We’re calling this news a “Rotten Idea” because both of the previous films earned Rotten Tomatometer scores, with the scores dropping from 49 percent for the first movie to just 34 percent for the second film.2.&nbsp;TYLER PERRY TO REMAKE WACKY BODY SWAP COMEDY MISS GRANNYSpeaking of popular Lionsgate movies with Rotten Tomatometer scores, let’s move on to Tyler Perry. As a director, producer and star (as Medea), Perry has an astonishing track record of solid box office performance&nbsp;despite frequently negative critical receptions. Perry, therefore, is somewhat emblematic of that age-old tug-of-war between critical success and the sort of obvious populist product that Perry’s target audiences keep returning for again and again. We do, however, judge “Rotten Ideas” largely on previous Tomatometer scores, and so that’s where this latest project is going to land. Tyler Perry has signed on to produce an English remake of the Korean hit comedy Miss Granny. The premise of this comedy (and its remake) centers on a 70-year-old woman (probably played by Tyler Perry) who swaps bodies with a young woman in her 20s. Then, presumably, hilarity and high jinks&nbsp;ensue. It’s not yet known if Tyler Perry will directly remake Miss Granny as the next Madea movie, or if it will be its own separate property.1.&nbsp;MAX LANDIS REMAKING HIS DAD’S HORROR COMEDY CLASSIC AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDONThere is a continuing disagreement about which movies should be remade, and what it means when one chooses to remake a film. On one side, the argument is that widely acknowledged classic films should never be remade (ie, “you can’t do better than that!”). On the other hand, some filmmakers think that remakes are a way of honoring the original. One such example of that was John Carpenter’s The Thing, which is now held in higher regard by many than the original film, 1951’s The Thing From Another World. The rebuttal to that argument, is that most such remakes are not better (such as say, the 2011 remake of Carpenter’s The Thing). One of the horror comedies of the 1980s that many fans hold in high esteem is John Landis’ 1981 deconstruction on lycanthropy tropes (“lycantropes!”), An American Werewolf in London, which has earned Certified Fresh status on Rotten Tomatoes. Although he also directed such favorites as Trading Places, The Blues Brothers, and National Lampoon’s Animal House, the argument could be made that it was with An American Werewolf in London that John Landis had his longest lasting impact, establishing a new form of “horror comedy” that has been frequently revisited. We wanted to heap all that praise before revealing this week’s “rotten idea,” which is that John Landis’ son Max has decided to write a remake of An American Werewolf in London for Universal Pictures. This remake will be produced by some of the people behind&nbsp;The Walking Dead, but no other details are known yet. Max Landis did score a Certified Fresh rating with Chronicle, but all of his other Tomatometer credits are Rotten (such as American Ultra, Victor Frankenstein, Mr. Right, and Me Him Her).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Ellie, Avengers, Broadway, The, watch, dragons, travel, 24, service, BAFTA, teaser, dogs, Amazon, Best","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11124052/Deadpool-X-Force-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"x-force-to-debut-in-deadpool-3-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509190256017","title":"Vin Diesel Offers Some Spoilery Groot Details, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Vin Diesel Offers Some Spoilery Groot Details, and More Movie NewsNew roles for Naomi Watts, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, and Will Ferrell, plus a Puff the Magic Dragon movie and another Little Shop of Horrors remake.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 9, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Emily the Strange, Little Shop of Horrors, Puff the Magic Dragon, and new roles for Will Ferrell, Kate McKinnon, and Shailene Woodley.This WEEK’S TOP STORYVIN DIESEL REVEALS FUTURE GROOT PLANS (ALSO, SPOILERS)The tricky thing about following film development news on any sort of regular basis is that it opens you up to possible spoilers. For the most part, the Internet in 2016 has actually been sort of good at acting as a spoiler filter (that is, it used to be worse). Just by their nature, however, some stories are basically spoilers. We say all that to say this: if you don’t want a future Marvel Studios movie to be spoiled, stop reading now. Still here? Okay, here we go. This week, while at the Brazil Comic Con, Vin Diesel revealed two details about his character Groot in (most likely) two different movies. Let’s start with probably the biggest news (also the least spoilerish), which is&nbsp;that director James Gunn would like to someday direct a Guardians of the Galaxy spinoff following the continued adventures of Rocket and Groot (just our guess at the title for such a film). If a Rocket and Groot movie did happen, it would be after Avengers: Infinity War (5/4/18), according to Vin Diesel. Vin Diesel also revealed that he knows that, “somewhere in the universe, you’re going to see Groot and Hulk battle.” Now, there’s two possible places that could happen (soon), and that’s in next year’s Thor: Ragnarok (which Hulk is a big part of), and in the aforementioned Avengers: Infinity War, which seems likely to have both the Guardians and Hulk in it. Presuming that guess is accurate, perhaps a Groot vs Hulk fight was likely any way, but Vin Diesel may have also just confirmed it.&nbsp; And that confirmation is therefore possibly a spoiler… if Marvel actually didn’t put that scene in the eventual trailer (and that itself, is probably not that likely). All of that is also spoils the fact that you will eventually see Groot grow up enough to fight Hulk (unless of course, Hulk himself gets shrunk!). You will next be able to see (Baby) Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 (5/5/17).Fresh Developments1. SHAILENE WOODLEY TO STAR IN SEA THRILLER ADRIFTShailene Woodley is now 25 years old, which means she’s probably done&nbsp;playing teenagers, and will focus more on&nbsp;“adult” roles (age-wise, not porn!). For example, as of this week, Woodley is now attached to star in Adrift, a true story drama about a young woman who finds herself on a shipwreck alone at sea. The screenplay was adapted by the non-fiction book by Tami Oldham Ashcraft, Red Sky in Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss, and Survival at Sea (a title which probably tells you what happens to whichever actor eventually signs on to costar with Shailene Woodley).&nbsp; Although some of director Baltasar Kormakur’s earlier films received Rotten Tomatometer scores, his last three films as director have been Fresh, so we’re calling this one of the week’s Fresh Developments as well. (Those three films were 2013’s 2 Guns and The Deep, and 2015’s Everest.) Kormakur’s The Deep was also about someone stuck alone at sea, except that Adrift is set in the tropics, instead of near Iceland.2. NAOMI WATTS AND REESE WITHERSPOON TO STAR IN BIRD MOVIE PENGUIN BLOOMThis week, the world received its first confirmation that at least some non-bird dinosaurs did indeed have feathers like birds, sort of messing up the Jurassic Park franchise. Almost certainly coincidentally, one of the week’s big casting stories also involved a story about a bird. That’s because Naomi Watts (The Ring, The Impossible) and Reese Witherspoon (Cruel Intentions, Election) are now attached to star in an Australian family drama called Penguin Bloom. Based on the title, you might think the bird in question was a penguin, but it’s actually about the true story of a magpie chick who helped a family cope after one of them suffers a handicapping injury (a high fall from a hotel in Thailand, ouch!). You can read more about the true story right here.&nbsp;Penguin Bloom will be filmed on location in Australia, but the project doesn’t currently have a director or even a screenwriter (they might be looking for both in the same person).3. HALF A CENTURY LATER, PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON TO FINALLY FLY TO THE BIG SCREENYes, that’s right, Baby Boomers, we can now refer to pop cultural artifacts from your signature decade as half a century old. In this case, we’re going to be talking about the folk song and pop hit, “Puff the Magic Dragon,” which Peter, Paul &amp; Mary have long sworn up and down has absolutely nothing to do with smoking any sort of, well, anything. Which is probably a good thing for this week’s news, because it sounds like the Puff the Magic Dragon is absolutely being planned as a “kids’ movie.” Having said that, it’s also coming to us via one of the producers of the recent (arguably) psychedelic color bonanza, DreamWorks’ Trolls. This Puff the Magic Dragon movie — planned by Fox Animation as an animation/live action hybrid– will be the first theatrically released feature film adaptation, following a 1978 short film and a 1979 TV movie. Producer Mike Mitchell’s credits as director also include Sky High, Shrek Forever After, and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked.4. EMILY THE STRANGE TO MOPE HER ANIMATED WAY TO THE BIG SCREENThe idea of a feature film based on the Dark Horse Comics (and clothing brand) character Emily the Strange has been kicking around Hollywood for several years now, dating back at least to 2010. Back then, it sounded like Chloe Moretz might have starred in a&nbsp;live action adaptation, but as Moretz is now just two months from her 20th birthday, she may have since aged out of the target range. Well, the Emily the Strange movie is still in the works, but pretty much every thing else about it now different. Universal Pictures has since departed the film, which is now set up at Amazon Studios, which is planning on Emily the Strange now being a fully animated film. That’s certainly one way to get the movie produced and released without worrying about their star looking young enough or, for that matter, “goth” enough.5. WILL FERRELL’S SPORTS COMEDY LEGACY CONTINUES WITH… ESPORTS?If you haven’t already been exposed to this phenomenon in your life, there is now such a thing out in the real world as “eSports.” Or as it might otherwise be known, “playing video games professionally and being followed in the same way that people follow professional athletes.” Since you don’t have to be a (physical) “athlete” to be an eSports star, it may have been inevitable that someone in Hollywood would hit upon the idea of making a comedy about it. Will Ferrell has previously starred in a few different sports comedies in the past, including Semi-Pro, Blades of Glory, Kicking and Screaming, and of course, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. So, of course it’s Ferrell who is now attached to star in Legendary Pictures’ untitled comedy about eSports. Ferrell will play an online sports competitor who is not only not a “physical athlete,” but who is also much older than the other gamers (some of whom are teenagers).6.&nbsp;ROGER AILES SEX SCANDAL FILM IN THE WORKSSometimes, a single movie can become the source of several related films that spawn from it, and not for the usual reasons (sequels, remakes, etc). What we’re talking about is a film that establishes a certain sentiment, and then the director, the writers, producers, etc go off and make more movies like that. In this case, we’re talking about last year’s The Big Short, in which comedy director Adam McKay made an abrupt career change to topical movies about true stories (in that case, the housing bubble crisis). Since its release, we’ve already seen McKay take on two more similar projects, about the Theranos scandal&nbsp;and about the life of Vice President Dick Cheney. Well, now, we have another movie based on that sort of topical recent event, and boy, this one is a doozie.&nbsp;The Big Short screenwriter Charles Randolph (also of Love &amp; Other Drugs) has sold a pitch to Megan Ellison’s Annapurna Pictures based on the sex scandal at Fox News involving Roger Ailes and female personalities there, including Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson. Until the movie comes out to really educate us all, here’s the Wikipedia entry for the events the film will likely cover.&nbsp; Until then, who would you cast as the bigger-than-life personalities involved here, such as Roger Ailes, Megyn Kelly, and Gretchen Carlson?7. WALTON GOGGINS CAST AS VILLAIN IN ALICIA VIKANDER’S TOMB RAIDER REBOOTIt’s been a while now since we last heard news about the reboot of the video game franchise Tomb Raider, which will feature Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina) as explorer Lara Croft. Filming is scheduled to start in early 2017 to get ready for a release on March 16, 2018, so it’s not surprising that we are now starting to hear more about it. This week’s news is that fan favorite Walton Goggins (TV’s Justified, Vice Principals, Sons of Anarchy, The Hateful Eight) has been cast as the movie’s main villain…&nbsp;but we don’t really know much more than that right now. The Tomb Raider reboot’s current competition on the March 25, 2018 weekend is Warner Bros’ own The Flash, which really just suggests that The Flash will probably be moved to another date soon (following the recent departure of director Rick Famuyiwa).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. KATE MCKINNON TO STAR IN YA ADAPTATION THE LUNCH WITCHThe verdict is still out on whether this weekend’s Office Christmas Party will be a box office hit, but one of its stars landed a deal in front of it anyway. Kate McKinnon, star of both Saturday Night Live and this summer’s Ghostbusters, has signed to star in Amblin Entertainment’s adaptation&nbsp;of the YA series The Lunch Witch. The first book tells the story of a witch named Grunnhilda, whose family has “stirred up trouble in a big, black pot… for generations and generations.”&nbsp;The Lunch Witch is usually portrayed as being much more heavyset than Kate McKinnon is, but&nbsp;it’s not yet known if Kate McKinnon will be gaining weight for the role, if she will use a “fat suit,” or if some sort of motion-capture animation will be utilized to bring the character to (larger than) life.&nbsp;The Lunch Witch will mark the live action debut of director Clay Kaytis, who made his directorial debut earlier this by codirecting The Angry Birds Movie, which received a Rotten score of just 43 percent on the Tomatometer.1. REMAKE ME, SEYMOUR?&nbsp; LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS TO GET A THIRD VERSIONOn stage, film, and TV these days, we sort of take it for granted that a lot of musicals are adaptations of old movies (that often were not themselves musical, such as Evil Dead: The Musical). An early example of this, however was the 1982 musical Little Shop of Horrors, which in 1986 became a movie musical starring Rick Moranis, Steve Martin, and Levi Stubbs as the voice of Audrey II, the plant monster. Certified Fresh with a score of 90 percent, you might assume that film would be relatively safe from being&nbsp;remade. Then again, you’re not a Warner Bros executive. That’s because Warner Bros is indeed now developing a new movie musical remake of Little Shop of Horrors. To that end, the studio has hired TV producer Greg Berlanti, who is known for his work on the four shows on The CW adapting DC Comics properties: Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, and Legends of Tomorrow. Those shows are popular among fans and often do well critically, but Berlanti’s previous credits in film are quite different, with his last three credits all designated Rotten. Those films are: Life As We Know It (28 percent), Green Lantern (26 percent), and last year’s (Peter Pan remake) Pan (27 percent).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Winners, John, the","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/09161254/Groot-Diesel-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"vin-diesel-offers-some-spoilery-groot-details-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509191855512","title":"Leonardo DiCaprio Will Bring Us a Captain Planet Movie, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Leonardo DiCaprio Will Bring Us a Captain Planet Movie, and More NewsTom Hiddleston, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, Peter Dinklage, and Hugh Grant get new roles, and WB plans a Willy Wonka prequel.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 21, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Captain Planet, Deadpool 2, Mary Poppins Returns, and the Willy Wonka prequelThis WEEK’S TOP STORYLEONARDO DICAPRIO PRESENTS: THE CAPTAIN PLANET MOVIEThe plundering of childhood nostalgia is (obviously) generational, and progressive. By this point, Hollywood is pretty much done with the 1960s and 1970s, and is starting to run out of material from the 1980s as well. The 1990s, however, is sort of just getting started. Kids cartoon shows really don’t get more 1990s than Captain Planet and the Planeteers, the 1990-1996 show about an international group of five well-intentioned (the four elements plus “the power of heart”) kids who can summon Captain Planet, a blue-skinned superhero and mullet enthusiast. The idea of a Captain Planet movie has been bounced around for a while now, but so far, the closest we’ve gotten is this NSFW Don Cheadle short film. That may change by the end of the decade, however, because this week, Leonardo DiCaprio’s Appian Way Productions teamed up with Paramount Pictures to get a screenplay into fast development. There’s not yet any word as to whether DiCaprio will star in Captain Planet, but if he did, it might be more likely as one of the film’s anti-environment villains than as the title hero (and certainly not as one of the young Planeteers). A better possibility to play Captain Planet might be Everybody Wants Some star Glen Powell, who is being eyed as being one of the film’s screenwriters.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;MARVEL’S LOKI, TOM HIDDLESTON, JOINS AARDMAN’S EARLY MANIt has now been over 10 years since the release of the last stop-motion claymation movie from Aardman Studios directed by Nick Park, who codirected Chicken Run, the Wallace &amp; Gromit shorts, and 2005’s Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. During that time, Nick Park has been focusing his efforts on other projects at Aardman, including the TV series Shaun the Sheep. Park will once again direct an Aardman feature film for 2018, a prehistoric comedy called Early Man, about the cultural shifts that result when Stone Age man (ie, “cavemen”) first come into contact with Bronze Age life (the whiz-bang high technology of the day). Eddie Redmayne will provide the voice of the lead caveman, and this week, we found out who will voice the film’s antagonist. Tom Hiddleston (AKA Marvel’s Loki) has joined Early Man as the voice of Lord Nooth, “governor of the Bronze Age town, who is a money-loving tyrant and rival to the film’s Stone Age hero, Dug (Redmayne).” Previous Aardman films were released in the USA by DreamWorks or Sony Pictures, but Early Man is currently seeking American distribution for its release sometime in 2018.2.&nbsp;WHO WILL BE THE LUCKY ACTRESS TO PLAY DOMINO IN DEADPOOL SEQUEL?If your bladder was strong enough for you to stay until the end of Deadpool, you were able to see the Merc-with-a-Mouth confirm that he will be joined by Cable in the sequel (which will probably be called something like Deadpool &amp; Cable). We still don’t know who will be playing Cable (sorry, KK!), but this week, a (relative) shortlist of actresses now testing to play another popular character was revealed. The character in question is fan favorite Domino, a mutant with the ability to manipulate probability (ie, ridiculously good luck for her, very unfortunate luck for bad guys), and a huge black circle tattoo over her left eye. The ten actresses up for the role of Domino include both established actresses&nbsp;and relative newcomers. Two of them have previous experience in comic book adaptations: Sofia Boutella (Kingsman: The Secret Service, Star Trek: Beyond) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Scott Pilgrim vs the World, 10 Cloverfield Lane). Winstead and Lizzy Caplan (Showtime’s Masters of Sex) also both have the Cloverfield franchise in common. A couple are better known for spy movies: Eve Hewson (Bridge of Spies; Maid Marion in next year’s Robin Hood: Origins),&nbsp; Stephanie Sigman (Spectre; TV’s Narcos), and if you count G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra as a spy movie, Sienna Miller (American Sniper). Even if they’re not cast as Domino, both Mackenzie Davis (The Martian) and Dutch model-turned-actress Sylvia Hoeks will costar (in unknown roles) in next year’s Blade Runner 2049 (10/6/17). (Another model-turned-actress, Kelly Rohrbach, will be the new C.J. next summer in the Baywatch movie.) Speaking of franchise sequels, Ruby Rose has three such films coming in 2017: Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, and John Wick Chapter 2. The Deadpool sequel doesn’t have a release date yet, but there’s a very good chance that Fox will schedule it for sometime in 2018.3.&nbsp;PETER DINKLAGE AND ELLE FANNING TO STAR IN POST-APOCALYPTIC I THINK WE’RE ALONE NOWArguably one of the most effective trailers of early 2016, 10 Cloverfield Lane used the Tommy James and the Shondells version of “I Think We’re Alone Now” to establish a mood which gets much creepier when the RPM of the song slows down. That song was probably also chosen because the movie is literally about three people who think they’re alone. In 2018, the title I Think We’re Were Alone Now will be used even more literally, as that film will be a sci-fi drama about a handyman who thinks he’s the last human being on Earth, until he meets someone else, a young woman. Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones) and Elle Fanning (Super 8, The Neon Demon) are now both signed on to star in I Think We’re Alone Now. The film will be directed by Reed Morano, who made her&nbsp;feature film debut last year with the indie film Meadowland, which still has a perfectly Fresh Tomatometer score of 100 percent.4.&nbsp;COLIN FIRTH TO LEND BRIT CREDENTIALS TO MARY POPPINS RETURNSAs one of Hollywood’s biggest and most successful studios, Walt Disney Pictures is something of a corporate master of the publicity-generating slow rollout of casting news. We’re still over two years away from the Christmas, 2018 release of the sequel Mary Poppins Returns, but throughout 2016, Disney has consistently generated headlines for the film through a series of announcements. The initial news that the titular nanny would be played by Emily Blunt (The Girl on the Train) was followed by news about Lin-Manuel Miranda (Hamilton) and adult Banks siblings Ben Whishaw and Emily Mortimer. This week, the news is about yet another famous British actor, Colin Firth (The King’s Speech, Bridget Jones’ Diary), who will play the president of a bank.&nbsp;Mary Poppins Returns will be directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago, Into the Woods) when it umbrella-sails back into theaters on December 25, 2018.5.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN GLEESONS: BRENDAN JOINS PADDINGTON 2; DOMNHALL JOINS PETER RABBITSomething else (besides Mary Poppins Returns) that Colin Firth and Ben Whishaw have in common is that Firth was originally cast as the voice of Paddington before dropping out, and being replaced by Whishaw. That film became an international box office hit ($288 million on a budget of around $55 million), and so of course, there’s going to be a sequel, which now started filming.&nbsp;We learned this week that in addition to several returning cast members, two new stars have joined Paddington 2. The two big new names are Hugh Grant (who one can hypothesize himself might have been a good choice to voice the bear) and Irish actor Brendan Gleeson. Gleeson’s son Domhnall Gleeson also made the news this week for joining the voice cast of Peter Rabbit (who will be played by TV’s James Corden). Domhnall Gleeson is probably best known for playing Bill Weasley in the later Harry Potter movies, and also for playing one of the Imperial villains in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Sony Pictures will release Peter Rabbit in time for the Easter season in April of 2018.6.&nbsp;LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO DISCOVER ROCK &amp; ROLL AS SAM PHILLIPSWith a film acting career that now numbers close to 40 films (38, to be exact), Leonardo DiCaprio is now at a point where he can start ticking off all the different genres and themes that his movie roles haven’t yet touched. Up above, you may have noticed that DiCaprio is now attached as the producer of the Captain Planet movie, and if he costars in it as well, “superhero” will be another such genre addressed. The accomplished actor&nbsp;has already been in a few biopics (Catch Me If You Can, Wolf of Wall Street, The Aviator), but a specific type of biopic he hasn’t starred in yet is the “musical biopic.” If this week’s third DiCaprio story works out (he was busy this week), that will change, because he’s now attached to produce and star in an adaptation of the Peter Guralnick book Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock ‘N’ Roll, which, as the title suggests, is a book about Sam Phillips, a man who at least helped popularize rock and roll. When Memphis DJ Sam Phillips opened his own recording studio and launched a label (Sun Records) to go with it, he set the path for the world discovering such musicians as Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Ike Turner, and the most famous of them all, Elvis Presley.7.&nbsp;TOM HARDY TO TEST HIS ENDURANCE AS ANTARCTIC EXPLORER SHACKLETONPhoto: Jenny Anderson / Getty ImagesLeonardo DiCaprio wasn’t the only Inception star to attach himself to an ambitious biographic film this week. Another such film is the long-planned film about Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton, who is most famous for the 1914 Endurance expedition, which became an unintentionally ironic name for a struggle to survive at the bottom of the world. Tom Hardy is now attached to star in the untitled Ernest Shackleton biopic (which is sometimes called just Shackleton). It will probably take a few years for this film to get produced, but in the meantime, we already have the award-winning 2000 documentary&nbsp;The Endurance: Shackleton’s Legendary Antarctic Expedition.8. JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT CLAIMS SOVEREIGN SCI-FI RIGHTSEspecially if you don’t count ensemble films (like The Dark Knight Rises and Inception), Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues to struggle to identify with audiences as a stand-alone movie star who can reliably draw significant crowds. To his credit, however, JGL remains able to find producers and financiers who are willing to take the chance that any day now, he will be a huge movie star. The latest such effort is a British science fiction film called Sovereign, in which Joseph Gordon-Levitt will star as a man who sets out to find his wife and the crew of a space station after they both disappear (it’s unclear if she was also part of the space station).ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1.&nbsp;IT TRULY TAKES PURE IMAGINATION TO THINK THAT WILLY WONKA NEEDS A PREQUELSequels (and their very close cousins, prequels) can be divided into three groups: 1) movies with an obvious demand; 2) movies that people don’t realize that they actually want; and 3) movies that there is very little demand for, realized or not. Some are lucky enough to be #1, others are sublimely #2, but the reality is that most end up being #3 (and always were). Another obvious sequel truth is that success doesn’t require succession. But alas, this is a lesson rarely learned. This week, the embodiment of the unnecessary sequel in film development news is the newly revealed plan to develop a Willy Wonka prequel, about his adventures before settling down as a chocolate factory wunderkind. To that end, Warner Bros has acquired the rights to the entire Willy Wonka intellectual property from the Roald Dahl Estate. The movie will not necessarily be an “origin story,” but that it will indeed tell Wonka’s early adventures, with an eye towards establishing a new franchise of films (because, well, obviously). One possibility is that the first film could address how Wonka first met the Oompa-Loompas. There’s no word yet as to what actor might play Willy Wonka, but since the 2005 remake was 11 years ago, and this is a prequel, you can pretty much bet that it will not be Johnny Depp.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Dates, Guild, Exclusive, PaleyFest, shows, OWN, popular, in, zombies, spy, marvel, FXX","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/21114430/Captain-Planet-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"leonardo-dicaprio-will-bring-us-a-captain-planet-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509191867802","title":"Disney Plans a Live-Action Mulan in Time for 20th Anniversary, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Disney Plans a Live-Action Mulan in Time for 20th Anniversary, and More Movie NewsNicholas Hoult is Nikola Tesla, Angelina Jolie and Chris Hemsworth both join Afghanistan war movies, Chloë Grace Moretz joins Suspiria, and Disney's Enchanted sequel gets a director.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 7, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Gears of War, Han Solo: A Star Wars Story, and Mulan.This WEEK’S TOP STORYDISNEY’S LIVE ACTION MULAN TO CELEBRATE 20TH ANNIVERSARY IN 2018With Marvel Studios, Pixar, and Star Wars all on their slate now, Walt Disney Pictures could probably be the #1 studio in some years even if they didn’t release any other films. Looking forward to the year 2018, it’s now almost a certainty, because that year will give us Wreck-It Ralph 2 (3/9/18), Toy Story 4 (6/15/18), the “Jack and the Beanstalk” adaptation Gigantic (11/21/18), and Mary Poppins Returns (12/25/18). Before this week, there were also three mystery films (including ones on 4/6/18 and 8/3/18), but we now know what the film scheduled for November 2, 2018 is going to be. It’s a surprise, too, because it’s one of the films&nbsp;that, until this week, wasn’t known to be on Disney’s “fast track.” Specifically, we’re talking about a live-action remake of Mulan, based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan, a warrior heiress who takes her father’s place in the army before a great war, and we&nbsp;can make a couple of guesses as to why it’s been scheduled. One is that the year 2018 marks the 20th anniversary of the film, which debuted&nbsp;in 1998. Secondly, Sony Pictures announced last month that they are also developing a live action Mulan movie. Walt Disney Pictures is now beginning an international casting search to find an actress to star as Mulan. In the meantime, the screenwriting team of Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (Rise of the Planet of the Apes; cowriters of Jurassic World) have been rehired to rewrite the Mulan screenplay to get it ready for filming to start in 2017 in time for its release in late 2018. Jaffa and Silver are also working with James Cameron on his Avatar sequels (the first of which is also scheduled for late 2018). In other Disney news for late 2018, Emily Mortimer was cast this week as the adult Jane Banks in Mary Poppins Returns, joining Ben Whishaw (as her brother Michael), Lin-Manuel Miranda (as a lamplighter), and Emily Blunt as the title character.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;THREE ACTRESSES TEST FOR HAN SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY (POSSIBLY AS… MRS. SOLO?)One of the consequences of Disney’s acquisition of Lucasfilm was that in April, 2014, it was revealed that the extensive Star Wars Expanded Universe of stories and characters from hundreds of games and novels was no longer considered “canon.” That did, however, pave the way for a new Star Wars&nbsp;line of stories (and new characters) which already numbers in the dozens. One of those new characters was revealed in late 2015, as comic book readers learned that Han Solo may have had a wife, many years before Princess Leia, named Sana Starros. Sana Starros is also depicted in the comics as being a “person of color,” which leads us to this week’s big Star Wars news. Now that Alden Ehrenreich (Hail, Caesar!) has been cast as the young Han Solo, Lucasfilm is testing actresses for the female lead in his prequel spinoff. There may be others, but three of the actresses who have tested for the role are Tessa Thompson (Selma, Valkyrie in next year’s Thor: Ragnarok), Zoe Kravitz (Angel Salvadore in X-Men: First Class), and Naomi Scott (the Pink Ranger in next year’s Power Rangers). Lucasfilm is also looking for the new Lando Calrissian, who might be Donald Glover (from TV’s Community), but Disney wants to complete “a second round of tests to be certain on their decision.” Whomever the female lead actually is (and what character she’s playing), Walt Disney Pictures and Lucasfilm have scheduled the Han Solo spinoff prequel for May 25, 2018 (the week after How to Train Your Dragon 3 on May 18, 2018, and two weeks before Transformers: Bumblebee and Ocean’s Eight).&nbsp;Han Solo: A Star Wars Story (tentative title) will be directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the directors responsible for 21 Jump Street and The LEGO Movie.2.&nbsp;NICHOLAS HOULT CAST AS GENIUS INVENTOR NIKOLA TESLA IN THE CURRENT WARThere have been various efforts in the last several years to somehow tell the story of inventors Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, their conflict as both employer/employee, and later as the brainiacs on either side of the famous dispute over what sort of electrical current would become the&nbsp;worldwide standard (direct or alternating). Nikola Tesla’s alternating current patents were purchased by George Westinghouse, and with that, it became Westinghouse who took on Edison “directly.” Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange) has been attached for a while to star in The Current War as Thomas Edison, and last week, Michael Shannon began negotiations to costar as his competitor George Westinghouse. Now, just a week later, we can report that Nicholas Hoult (Mad Max: Fury Road, Beast in the newer X-Men movies) is officially in talks to play Nikola Tesla. Hoult’s involvement effectively means that the three stars represent the three biggest ongoing super hero concerns (Hoult from Fox’s X-Men movies; Cumberbatch being Marvel’s Doctor Strange; and Michael Shannon being DC’s General Zod from Man of Steel).&nbsp;The Current War will be directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, The Town That Dreaded Sundown), and as the Weinstein Company’s take on the Edison/Tesla competition, it should not be confused with The Last Days of Night, a similar film that has Eddie Redmayne attached to star&nbsp;as Westinghouse’s lawyer.3. SONY TELLS THE TRUTH ABOUT PROFESSOR MARSTON AND THE WONDER WOMANThe Golden Age of Superhero Comics (roughly 1938 to 1945) has plenty of fascinating true stories, but one of the standout figures is Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston. In addition to creating DC Comics’ most famous female superhero, Marston was also a psychologist and the inventor of one of the earliest “lie detector” devices. On top of all that, Marston also lived with both his wife and his mistress at the same time for several years. If the thought bubble above your head currently reads, “Gee, that sounds like the basis for a movie,” Sony Pictures is way ahead of you, with a film to be called Professor Marston and the Wonder Woman. Luke Evans (Dracula Untold) has been cast as William Moulton Marston, with his wife (and fellow inventor) Elizabeth Marston to be played by Rebecca Hall, and&nbsp; young mistress Olive to be played by Bella Heathcote. (You can read more about their three-way relationship in this piece&nbsp;by&nbsp;The Atlantic.) Sony Pictures has not yet announced a release date for Professor Marston and the Wonder Woman, but it sounds feasible that the studio hopes to release it next year, when Wonder Woman itself will also be released (on 6/2/17).4.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN AFGHANISTAN WAR MOVIES PART I: ANGELINA JOLIE AND SHOOT LIKE A GIRLAngelina Jolie has been making the news aplenty lately, but there was actually a story this week that has much less to do with her costar from Mr. and Mrs. Smith. It’s also one of two items this week about movies set during the war in Afghanistan. Angelina Jolie is now in talks with Sony Pictures to star in an adaptation&nbsp;of the upcoming memoir&nbsp;Shoot Like a Girl: One Woman’s Dramatic Fight in Afghanistan and on the Home Front.&nbsp;The film will tell the true story of Major Mary Jennings Hegar, who served multiple tours as a helicopter pilot, received a Purple Heart, and helped eliminate the military’s “ground combat exclusion policy” which prevented female members from serving in combat duties. There is no director or screenwriter attached yet to Shoot Like a Girl (and it’s not known if Angelina Jolie herself might end up directing as well as starring).5.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN AFGHANISTAN WAR MOVIES PART II: CHRIS HEMSWORTH AND HORSE SOLDIERSAngelina Jolie’s Shoot Like a Girl was actually the second movie announced this week based on a true story of the Afghanistan War. The first came with&nbsp;the news that Chris Hemsworth (Marvel’s Thor) and Michael Shannon (DC’s General Zod) are now both attached to star&nbsp;in Horse Soldiers, an adaptation of a book by Nicolai Fuglsig.&nbsp;Horse Soldiers will tell the true story of “a U.S. Special Forces team and their captain, who are sent to a rugged, mountainous region of Afghanistan in the weeks immediately following 9/11.”6. CHLOË GRACE MORETZ&nbsp;JOINS THE SUSPIRIA REMAKEChloë Grace Moretz is probably most famous for playing Hit-Girl in the two Kick-Ass movies, but she has another distinction, which is that she has starred now in three different horror movie remakes. First, there was the 2005 remake of The Amityville Horror, and that was followed by 2010’s Let Me In (remaking Let the Right One In), and finally 2013’s Carrie. Now, Moretz has signed on for yet another one, namely&nbsp;the remake of Dario Argento’s Suspiria. Moretz is joining three actresses who’ve already been announced: Dakota Johnson (the film’s lead), Tilda Swinton (the film’s villain), and Mia Goth. Like Dario Argento’s original film, Suspiria will tell the story of a ballet dancer who joins a famous dance academy in Europe, where she discovers that it is a front for an evil cult and the scene of a series of grisly murders. The Suspiria remake will be directed by Luca Guadagnino, who previously directed I Am Love and A Bigger Splash (in which Tilda Swinton and Dakota Johnson also starred).7.&nbsp;TITLES ANNOUNCED FOR THE BATMAN, LOGAN, AND BLADE RUNNER 2046This week, three different high profile movies received official titles. The first was the most obvious, because many sources have been calling Ben Affleck’s solo Batman movie The Batman by that title for a few months now anyway.&nbsp;The Batman (which Affleck is directing, writing, and starring in) doesn’t yet have a release date, but there’s still a chance it might debut&nbsp;in 2018. We also now know that the Blade Runner sequel will be called Blade Runner 2049, suggesting that it is set 30 years after the original (which took place in a fictional sci-fi version of 2019).&nbsp;Blade Runner 2049 will be released in one year (from yesterday), on October 6, 2017. Finally, Hugh Jackman revealed an image of the first poster for the movie we previously knew as The Wolverine 3, which will now be called just Logan, when it is released on March 3, 2017.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. DISNEY STILL WORKING ON ENCHANTED SEQUEL DISENCHANTEDBack in 2007, Walt Disney Pictures had a live action fairy tale hit ($340 million in global box office) years before they started succeeding consistently with their “live action fairy tale remakes.” Soon after, we started hearing fairly regularly about Disney’s plans for an Enchanted sequel, but next year will mark the first film’s tenth anniversary, and we still don’t have one. This week, however, that sequel, which will be called Disenchanted, got a little bit closer to happening, with the announcement of a director. Director Adam Shankman (Rock of Ages, Hairspray) is now in talks with Disney to direct Disenchanted, though we still don’t know if Amy Adams will be returning. We’re calling this one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because Shankman’s Tomatometer has only one Fresh score in the last 12 years (for Hairspray) and over a dozen Rotten ones.1. CAN GEARS OF WAR TURN THE CLOCK BACK ON ROTTEN VIDEO GAME REVIEWS?We here at RT hope for every movie to be great, but it’s difficult not to be&nbsp;concerned about one of the most reliable genre trends when it comes to Tomatometer scores. Specifically, we’re talking&nbsp;about video game adapations, which Hollywood seems insistent upon making&nbsp;the next big trend. Indeed, the highest Tomatometer score any video game adaptation has ever received was the 44 percent&nbsp;for Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and even that was still 16 percent shy of being Fresh. Of course, Hollywood tends to pay more attention to&nbsp;box office numbers, and the recent success of The Angry Birds Movie suggests that it’s&nbsp;feasible to make a profitable — if not particularly memorable — adaptation. (Although, for many films, next December’s Assassin’s Creed will probably be a closer test case.) The latest best-selling videogame to be put into development as a film project is Gears of War, the popular XBox/PC third-person shooter franchise.&nbsp;Gears of War&nbsp;will be a collaboration between Universal Pictures (also the studio behind Warcraft) and Microsoft, but it’s not yet known if it&nbsp;will be a direct adaptation of the first game, a later game, or if it will be its own entity merely inspired by the series.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Horror","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/07161337/Mulan-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"disney-plans-a-live-action-mulan-in-time-for-20th-anniversary-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509190264210","title":"Amy Schumer Will Be a Barbie Girl, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Amy Schumer Will Be a Barbie Girl, and More Movie NewsJoaquin Phoenix and Gus Van Sant reunite, the female Jump Street spinoff gets a (male) director, and John Goodman, Jodie Foster, Bradley Cooper, and Sacha Baron Cohen get new roles.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 2, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Barbie, Detective Pikachu, the female spinoff of 21 Jump Street, and new roles for Sacha Baron Cohen, Jodie Foster, and Joachin Phoenix.This WEEK’S TOP STORYAMY SCHUMER’S A BARBIE GIRL (LIFE IN PLASTIC, IT’S FANTASTIC!)We’ve known since 2014 since one of the new franchises that is a top priority for Sony Pictures is one based on Mattel’s Barbie, but what wasn’t clear was exactly what that meant. Specifically, what would a live-action Barbie movie be about?&nbsp; With today’s early casting news, we now have an answer, and it starts with the news that Amy Schumer (Trainwreck) is in talks to star in the Barbie movie. In a story described as being in the vein of Enchanted, Splash, and Big, Amy Schumer will play a character who gets kicked out of “Barbieland” for not being perfect enough, landing her in the real world (which makes it sound the most like Enchanted). The original Barbie screenplay was written by TV’s Hilary Winston (several episodes each of Community, My Name is Earl), but it will now be rewritten by Amy Schumer’s sister, Kim Caramele, to match it best to Schumer’s strengths. Caramele also wrote much of Inside Amy Schumer, and cowrote Schumer’s untitled comedy with Goldie Hawn (due out May 12, 2017). This first Barbie movie doesn’t have a director yet, it is expected to start filming sometime in 2017, aiming for a release date in the summer of 2018.Fresh Developments1. SACHA BARON COHEN TO SPOOF BILLIONAIRES’ GREEDThe presidential election was less than a month ago, but it appears that we’re already seeing the results being reflected in the choices that various creative types are making. The most obvious example this week involves satirical comedian Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat, The Dictator), who is best known for his improvisational comedies that blend in encounters with unsuspecting “real” people. Fox Searchlight is now considering picking up Cohen’s next film, called Greed, in which he will play a “cut-throat retail billionaire… inspired by the lavish lifestyles of the elite, perma-tanned billionaire businessmen who shamelessly invest money into offshore tax havens, a parody of the unacceptable face of capitalism.”&nbsp;Greed will be directed by Michael Winterbottom, whose previous comedies have included The Trip, The Trip to Italy, and 2005’s Tristram Shandy: A Cock &amp; Bull Story.2. ARE JOAQUIN PHOENIX AND DIRECTOR GUS VAN SANT A TEAM TO DIE FOR (AGAIN)?It’s now been over twenty years since River Phoenix’s nearly-unknown younger brother Joaquin costarred with Nicole Kidman in director Gus Van Sant’s To Die For. Based on this week’s news, however, Phoenix and Van Sant may soon be working together again. No deals are in place yet, but the pair&nbsp;are reportedly teaming up again on the biopic Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot. Gus Van Sant’s last few movies have received Rotten scores, but before 2011, his record included&nbsp;several Certified Fresh movies. This film will be an adaptation of the life of quadriplegic cartoonist John Callahan, who lost the use of his arms and legs in a car accident at the age of 21. As a cartoonist, Callahan taught himself how to hold a pen in his hands, and then move the pen using his mouth. You can browse examples of Callahan’s cartoon art here.&nbsp; John Callahan died in 2010 at the age of 59.3. JOHN GOODMAN TO STAR IN SCI-FI MOVIE CAPTIVE STATEJohn Goodman might be best known as one of the Coen Brothers’ frequent collaborators (The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Thou?) and as Dan on TV’s Roseanne, but in the last few years, Goodman has also been dabbling more in science fiction. In addition to this year’s 10 Cloverfield Lane, he&nbsp;also voices Hound in the Transformers franchise, has lent his voice to Ratchet &amp; Clank, and is one of the stars of next year’s Kong: Skull Island and (again in a voice role) Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. This week, Goodman signed on for yet another science fiction film, though that’s about all we know about the&nbsp;movie, called Captive State. Just about the only other major detail we know about Captive State&nbsp;right now is that it is planned to be the fourth film of director Rupert Wyatt (after The Escapist, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and 2014’s remake of The Gambler).4.&nbsp;SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING STAR TOM HOLLAND JOINS DAISY RIDLEY IN SOME CHAOS WALKINGNow that the fourth Divergent movie is skipping theaters, and other such franchises have basically come to a stop, it might seem like Hollywood has given up on adaptations of YA novels set in dystopian and/or post-apocalyptic futures. The studio that had the biggest success with is Lionsgate (The Hunger Games), even though they’re also the ones to pull the plug on the fourth Divergent theatrical release. The movie that seems to be their next foray into the genre is called Chaos Walking, based on a novel by author Patrick Ness. We’ve known for a while that Star Wars: The Force Awakens’&nbsp;Daisy Ridley was going to star in Chaos Walking, and this week, we learned that she will be joined by Spider-Man: Homecoming star Tom Holland.&nbsp;Chaos Walking will be set in a dystopian future where a germ/virus has killed all of the women. Holland will play a young man on the run with his dog who is surprised to find a girl (played by Daisy Ridley). The film&nbsp;will be directed by Doug Liman, whose previous science fiction films have included Jumper and Edge of Tomorrow.5.&nbsp;GOOSEBUMPS DIRECTOR TO HELP DETECTIVE PIKACHU INVESTIGATE POKEMONEarlier this summer, while the nation and the world in general was temporarily obsessed with the mobile game Pokemon Go, Legendary Pictures jumped at the opportunity to produce a live action Pokemon movie about the character Detective Pikachu. The popularity of Pokemon Go has settled down a bit, but Legendary Pictures is still very serious about fast tracking the Detective Pikachu movie. To that end, the company has hired director Rob Letterman&nbsp;to work on the film. Although he hit a speed bump with the Jack Black comedy Gulliver’s Travels in 2010, reteaming with Black again last year for Goosebumps led to something of a surprise success, with earning&nbsp;Certified Fresh score of 76 percent. The Detective Pikachu screenplay is being worked on by Alex Hirsch (TV’s Gravity Falls) and Nicole Perlman (Guardians of the Galaxy).6. JODIE FOSTER TO STAR IN FUTURISTIC THRILLER HOTEL ARTEMISSometimes, film projects are kept shrouded in such mystery that we don’t really have much to tell you except the skimpiest of details, and maybe the star or director. That’s pretty much what’s going on this week with Hotel Artemis, which is described as a near-future crime thriller. That’s it as far as knowing “what” it is. The other two most interesting details is that Jodie Foster will star in the film, and that it will mark the feature film directorial debut of screenwriter Drew Pearce. Pearce’s work as screenwriter has included cowriting duties on (possibly coincidentally) both Iron Man 3&nbsp;and the future sequel Sherlock Holmes 3 (starring Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law).7.&nbsp;ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY WON’T GET A SEQUEL (BESIDES THE ONE YOU’VE ALREADY SEEN)Some movie development news may seem fairly obvious, but it’s often difficult to tell what’s true and what isn’t until it’s clearly stated or debunked. One such example of that could be this month’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (12/16/16), and the question about whether this first Star Wars spinoff might receive its own sequel. (The obvious answer in this case? No.) This week producer Kathleen Kennedy (when she wasn’t “spoiling” certain story beats) confirmed that there are no plans for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story to ever receive its own sequel. Indeed, since Rogue One is a prequel set just before the original 1977 Star Wars, if you’ve seen that movie, then you’ve already seen the closest Rogue One will ever have to&nbsp;a “direct sequel.”ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. BRADLEY COOPER TO STAR IN WWII PARATROOPER DRAMA ATLANTIC WALLIt’s probably all a huge coincidence, but in 2017, the year after the building of a wall dominated political news, there are going to be two major new movies with Wall in the title, and this week brought news of another one, probably for 2018. Next year, Matt Damon will star in the Chinese action-fantasy The Great Wall (2/17/17), and Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Avengers: Age of Ultron) and John Cena (Trainwreck) will star in the Iraq War sniper drama The Wall (3/10/17). The third movie is a World War II drama called Atlantic Wall, and this week, we learned that Bradley Cooper is attached to star. Cooper will play “a lone American paratrooper stranded behind enemy lines hours before D-Day… [whose] assignment is to deliver intelligence critical to the outcome of the war, and he is compelled to fulfill a promise to protect the young son of a murdered ally.”&nbsp;Atlantic Wall will be the next film for director Gavin O’Connor, who has delivered three Rotten films (Pride and Glory, Jane Got a Gun, The Accountant) in his last four efforts (to be fair, 2011’s Warrior was Certified Fresh).&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;21 JUMP STREET FEMALE SPINOFF… TO BE WRITTEN/DIRECTED BY A DUDEThe subject of career prospects for female directors has been a popular subject this year — at least on social media — from the #52FilmsByWomen project, to columns like this&nbsp;and much of what is covered by sites&nbsp;like The Mary Sue. A common point of discussion has been about the disparity that some see between the ability of new male directors to land hot assignments in Hollywood versus what their female counterparts seem to be able to land (the gist of this column). With all that&nbsp;said, when there was&nbsp;talk this year that Sony Pictures was interested in doing a female spinoff of 21 Jump Street (ie, female stars instead of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum), it probably looked like an&nbsp;obvious opportunity for a female screenwriter or director. Well, no, not so much, because Sony Pictures has decided to hire screenwriter Rodney Rothman&nbsp;to make his directorial debut with the female spinoff of 21 Jump Street (which he will also write). Previously, Rothman co-wrote&nbsp;the boxing comedy Grudge Match&nbsp;and the sequel 22 Jump Street.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"motion, Fox, Century, Family","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/02153038/Amy-Schumer-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"amy-schumer-will-be-a-barbie-girl-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509191842198","title":"Johnny Depp Will Help Find Fantastic Beasts 2, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Johnny Depp Will Help Find Fantastic Beasts 2, and More Movie NewsDisney announces a live-action Snow White musical, Tom Cruise gets biblical, Tim Miller takes on Sonic the Hedgehog, and we get a Furby movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 4, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Furby, Rambo: New Blood, Snow White, and Sonic the Hedgehog.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJOHNNY DEPP TO HELP FIND FANTASTIC BEASTSJohnny Depp is known for many types of films, including true-story-based crime movies (Blow, Donnie Brasco, Public Enemies, Black Mass), theme-park-attraction-based movies (Pirates of the Caribbean), and Tim Burton movies (where does one even start?), but if there’s one general theme to Depp’s oeuvre, it’s that he specializes in playing wacky characters in movies with at least some separation from reality. Obviously, that includes the aforementioned Pirates and Burton movies, but there’s also Rango, Into the Woods, Yoga Hosers, and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (and that’s just from the last ten years). What we’re getting at is that Johnny Depp sure does like starring in movies featuring magic and/or the fantastic. This week, with the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them just two weeks away, we discovered that Depp has a small role in that film, and will have a lead role in the next one as well (release date: 11/16/18). Although Johnny Depp will “star” in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 2 (or whatever it ends up being called), that doesn’t mean that he will be completely replacing Eddie Redmayne, as Redmayne will still also be reprising his role as Newt Scamander. Director David Yates (who also directed the last four Harry Potter movies) will also be returning for the second movie (and possibly all four sequels, stretching out until 2022). No details are known yet about what Johnny Depp’s character will be like, such as whether he will be sporting wacky hair and/or makeup and/or eyes and/or voice.Fresh Developments1. DISNEY BITES THE LIVE-ACTION APPLE, COMMITS TO SNOW WHITE MUSICALWalt Disney Pictures has actually been working on a live action return to Snow White since way before their whole “live action reboot” thing started (with either 2010’s Alice in Wonderland or 2014’s Maleficent movie, depending upon how you define them). The project that Disney was working on for many years was called Snow and the Seven, and that movie (get this) would have applied a kung fu angle to the fairy tale, with the “seven dwarfs” also being martial arts experts. That movie (also called Order of the Seven) was shelved in 2012, but that didn’t mean Disney was never going to commit to a live action remake of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. This week, that development was confirmed with news that Disney is now actively developing a live action movie musical of Snow White (which may be called just that to separate it from the classic 1937 animated film, their first). The musical is expected to use both new original songs (by the songwriters behind this December’s La La Land), and songs from the original film (by which they probably mean “Heigh Ho,” “Whistle While You Work,” and “Some Day My Prince Will Come”). The screenwriter working on the Snow White musical is Erin Cressida Wilson, whose credits include the S&amp;M drama Secretary&nbsp;and last month’s The Girl on the Train. This Snow White musical joins the increasingly-hard-to-keep-track-of list of Disney remakes which also includes Cruella, Dumbo, The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Mulan (11/2/18), Peter Pan, and next year’s Beauty and the Beast (3/17/17).2.&nbsp;TOM CRUISE AND PIRATES 5 DIRECTOR TO ADAPT BIBLE EPIC METHUSELAHThe Bible really does have a surprising number of stories in it that could be adapted as action movies, if you know where to look. There’s Daniel and that pesky lion, Jonah and the whale, and so many battles of&nbsp;“Biblical proportions.” This writer isn’t sure&nbsp;that Noah’s grandfather Methuselah is really known for his action-packed adventures, but apparently, there are at least a few people in Hollywood who think he’s an action star over 969 years in the making. Tom Cruise is now attached to star in Warner Bros’ Methuselah, an action-packed epic based on the Biblical character you may have read about in the previous sentence. For Methuselah, Warner Bros has recruited director Joachim Rønning, who has directed next year’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (5/26/17), and who also previously co-directed 2006’s Bandidas and 2012’s Kon-Tiki. It’s not yet known if Rønning’s involvement means that Methuselah might soon get fast tracked, or if it will take so long that Tom Cruise won’t need any “old guy” makeup.3.&nbsp;ZACH GALIFIANAKIS STRIKES A HAPPY MEDIUM IN A WRINKLE IN TIMEAuthor Madeleine L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time (and its sequels) have been popular with young readers for decades now. One thing that separated the series from other fantasy franchises for kids&nbsp;(such as, notably, J.R.R. Tolkien’s novels) is that they very prominently feature a largely female cast of characters, including the three Mrs. (Who, Which, and Whatsit), Aunt Beast, and the Happy Medium. Until this week, Selma director Ava DuVernay has kept to that by casting Oprah Winfrey (Mrs. Which), Reese Witherspoon (Mrs. Whatsit), Mindy Kaling (Mrs. Who), and Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Dr. Kate Murry). For the Happy Medium (who is referred to as “she” in the book), DuVernay (and Disney) are switching things up a bit. That’s because it’s very obviously male (that beard!) Zach Galifianakis who has been cast as the Happy Medium. Galifianakis is joined by Andre Holland, Levi Miller, and last week’s addition Chris Pine. The film&nbsp;has now started filming&nbsp;but it&nbsp;doesn’t currently have a confirmed release date, though it’s expected to be sometime in the year 2018.4.&nbsp;DEADPOOL DIRECTOR TO TAKE A SPIN AT SONIC THE HEDGEHOGLast week was sort of dominated by the news (and three related stories) of director Tim Miller’s departure from the&nbsp;Deadpool sequel (which might be directed by one of the John Wick directors instead). Well, we didn’t have to wait much longer to find what Tim Miller wants to do instead, and the movie in question makes total sense, given the reports that Miller left Deadpool 2 because he wanted to make it&nbsp;a much bigger, more expensive production than the relatively cheap first Deadpool. Tim Miller is now attached to direct Sony Pictures’s adaptation of the popular and long-running video game franchise Sonic the Hedgehog. If you’re familiar with the bright blue, spikey-haired character, it should come as no surprise that&nbsp;Sonic the Hedgehog will be a CGI/live-action hybrid. (The villain Dr. Eggman seems like an obvious candidate to be one of the live action “human” characters.) That, however, was not the only story this week to result from Tim Miller leaving Deadpool 2, as composer Tom Holkenborg (AKA Junkie XL) has also left Deadpool 2, offering Miller’s departure as&nbsp;his direct reason for doing so.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK5. THIS WEEK IN STALLONE FRANCHISES: RAMBO: NEW BLOOD REBOOT AND ESCAPE PLAN 2Some movie stars have never appeared in a sequel (like say, Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, and Meryl Streep), and then there are actors like Sylvester Stallone, whose careers are pretty much defined by exactly how many franchises they have to their name. Stallone has Rocky, Rambo, The Expendables, and this week, he added another one to his list. But let’s start with this week’s Rambo news. Nu Image/Millennium Films have hired director Ariel Vromen (The Iceman, Criminal) to work on their reboot of the “John Rambo” franchise, which will start with a film called Rambo: New Blood, which is a play on the very first Stallone “Rambo” movie, First Blood. Rambo: New Blood will feature a new (not yet cast) actor as John Rambo, and Stallone is not expected to appear in the movie (unless he decides to take a cameo role, etc). Having said that, Sylvester Stallone is expected to reprise his role in the sequel Escape Plan 2 that was announced this week, although in a supporting role. It’s not yet known if other Escape Plan stars (such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sam Neill, or rapper 50 Cent) might also appear in the sequel.4.&nbsp;CALLING 1998: FURBY TO GET ITS OWN MOVIE BECAUSE FURBY USED TO BE A HUGE THINGProducer Bob Weinstein and his label TWC-Dimension (which is more devoted to genre movies than Harvey’s TWC) used the American Film Market this week to announce a five movie slate for 2017 (and beyond)&nbsp;that is aiming to get the distributor another hit. (Their last successful film was 2015’s Paddington.) The biggest revelation of the group was that TWC-Dimension is developing a Furby movie, based on the toy line which was very popular in 1998 and 1999. The Furby is a furry ovoid toy creature with big, creepy eyes which speaks in babyspeak and can slowly be taught to speak (some) English. The other four movies on Dimension’s active slate include The Six Billion Dollar Man (the TV show adaptation starring Mark Wahlberg), The War with Grandpa (starring Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken), a horror movie trying to make Polaroid cameras nostalgically scary, and a murder mystery called Murder Mystery.3.&nbsp;SONY ANNOUNCES STARSHIP TROOPERS REMAKE, FANS FREAK OUTLet’s get something out in the open right away. If you make another version of a movie that was based on a book, even if your new version is a little closer to the book, it’s still basically a remake. The only way that would not be true is if your new movie touched upon completely different material than the first movie did (for example, Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption adapted two different parts of the same book). Okay, on with the news that Columbia Pictures is now working on a new adaptation of Robert Heinlein’s 1959 science fiction novel Starship Troopers, which the studio swears is absolutely not a remake or a reboot of Starship Troopers (ie, the 1997 movie or any of its direct-to-video sequels). For this new Starship Troopers, Sony/Columbia has hired the screenwriting team of Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, who previously worked on the 2009 reboot of Friday the 13th, and next year’s wacky comedy reboot of TV’s Baywatch. Meanwhile, fans of Starship Troopers took to the Internet this week to express their sometimes extreme displeasure with the idea of Sony/Columbia making a new Starship Troopers, some of which you can see recapped here.2.&nbsp;THE NON-GRANT GUSTIN VERSION OF THE FLASH LOSES ITS SECOND DIRECTORPeople love The CW’s The Flash, and part of what people love about The Flash is Grant Gustin. All that being true, Warner Bros decided that, for their movies (which are way, way, way more expensive, and therefore more of a risk), it made more sense to cast Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin) as The Flash (which looks like this). The first director attached to The Flash was Pride and Prejudice and Zombies creator Seth Grahame-Smith, who eventually departed, and was then replaced by Dope director Rick Famuyiwa. Famuyiwa seemed very committed to directing The Flash, which included going so far as casting his Dope star Kiersey Clemons as future Mrs. The Flash Iris Allen. And that leads us to this week’s news that Rick Famuyiwa has departed The Flash due to that old familiar chestnut, “creative differences.” This is especially bad news for Kiersey Clemons (who doesn’t get to abandon her Flash contract just because Famuyiwa is leaving), who was quoted as saying that the news of Famuyiwa’s departure is “very upsetting.” Warner Bros has scheduled The Flash for March 16, 2018, but if they can’t find a directorial replacement very soon, it’s highly likely that the studio will have to push that release date back some.1. AAAAY, BE COOL!&nbsp; TOM HARDY TO JUMP THE SHARK AS FONZO2015 was not a good year for director Josh Trank, who not only&nbsp;“departed” one of the Star Wars spinoff prequels (it’s still unclear which one he was attached to, Han Solo’s, or another), and saw his Fantastic Four&nbsp;become a critical and box office bomb. 2016 might be almost over, but it appears that it might end slightly better for Trank, because this week, we learned that he is still able to get work as a director. Josh Trank has convinced Tom Hardy to sign on for a movie called Fonzo which will not, as the title (or our totally fakeout headline) suggests, have anything to do with Arthur “The Fonz” Fonzarelli. Instead, it will be about the last year in the life of Chicago mobster Al Capone (we know this because it’s about Capone at age 47, and he died in prison at age 48). As you might have gathered by putting the previous two sentences together, Tom Hardy will play Al Capone in Fonzo, which means, as an image like this suggests, Tom Hardy is either going to have to gain weight for the role, or wear a lot of makeup.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Red, dceu","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/04161017/Johnny-Depp-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"johnny-depp-will-help-find-fantastic-beasts-2-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509193452969","title":"Disney Announces Sequel to Wreck-It Ralph, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Disney Announces Sequel to Wreck-It Ralph, and More Movie NewsDaniel Craig makes a Bond connection, Jackie Chan joins Ninjago, and Barkhad Abdi signs on for the Blade Runner sequel.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 1, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you&nbsp;nine&nbsp;headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Ninjago, and Minecraft, and also the sequels to Blade Runner and Wreck-It Ralph.This Week’s Top StoryDISNEY ANNOUNCES WRECK-IT RALPH SEQUEL FOR EARLY 2018The USA may still be waiting for a genuine box office hit that is adapted from a video game (not counting Warcraft, currently at $413 million in global box office), but Walt Disney Animation came close in late 2012 when their Wreck-It Ralph earned $165 million in the USA and $471 million worldwide. That movie was an original property and concept, although it did feature dozens of licensed video games as easter eggs, cameos, and supporting roles (and so did the much-less successful Pixels last year). In&nbsp;three years since, there has been talk about a possible Wreck-It Ralph sequel,&nbsp;but the only two films with official release dates (not counting the undated Frozen 2) were the Polynesian fantasy adventure Moana (11/23/16), and the Jack and the Beanstalk romance Gigantic,&nbsp;the latter of which&nbsp;(about Jack falling in love with a 60-foot-tall girl giant) was bumped back eight months to November 21, 2018 after initially being scheduled for a March release. The animated Disney movie taking over the release date vacated by Gigantic will indeed be a sequel to the 2012 hit Wreck-It Ralph (whose potential title may or may not be&nbsp;Super Wreck-It Ralph). The sequel will be set six years after the first movie, and will involve Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) somehow “breaking the Internet,” as the focus shifts from old school arcade games to the modern era of gaming. Director Rich Moore (who also directed this year’s Zootopia) has already revealed that one game/movie that might receive at least a “nod” is TRON, which was also a Disney film. The March 9, 2018 release date that Disney is giving the Wreck-It Ralph sequel is just three weeks before March 30, 2018, the release date for Warner Bros and Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Ready Player One, another movie promising lots of video game cameos and easter eggs.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;CAPTAIN PHILLIPS BREAKOUT STAR BARKHAD ABDI JOINS BLADE RUNNER SEQUELIn the months following the release of Captain Phillips, many hailed Somali-American actor Barkhad Abdi as the film’s breakout discovery, with predictions and hopes that it would lead to lots of great new roles. Abdi has indeed kept busy, including supporting roles in Eye in the Sky and The Brothers Grimsby, but he hasn’t yet appeared in a movie with as high of a profile as Captain Phillips (much less what someone would consider a “tentpole” release). That appears to have changed this week, because Barkhad Abdi has joined the cast of the long-awaited sequel to Blade Runner. Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners) is directing the sequel, whose cast&nbsp;includes Harrison Ford (obviously), Ryan Gosling, Dave Bautista, and Robin Wright. Warner Bros has scheduled the Blade Runner sequel (title to be announced) for October 6, 2017.2. DANIEL CRAIG JOINS FORMER BOND GIRL HALLE BERRY IN KINGSWe haven’t yet heard for sure which actor will star in the 25th “James Bond” movie, but the star of the most recent four, Daniel Craig, continues to sign on for movies which arguably could/would conflict with that film’s production schedule. The latest example is called&nbsp;Kings, for which Craig is now in talks to join former Bond girl Halle Berry (Die Another Day). If the deal goes through, Craig will play a “loner” living in South Central Los Angeles during the 1992 L.A. riots in love with Berry’s character, and the encroaching violence motivates him to try to protect her and her children.&nbsp;Kings will also mark the English-language debut of Turkish director Deniz Gamze Erguven, whose Certified Fresh drama&nbsp;Mustang was nominated for an Academy Award this year.3. ANSEL ELGORT TO ROLL 3D6 FOR CHARISMA, AND STAR IN DUNGEONS AND DRAGONSThe pencil-and-paper role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons has been a popular global franchise for over 40 years now, leading to&nbsp;(hundreds of) novels, dozens of video games, and even a fondly remembered Saturday morning cartoon series (1983 to 1985 on CBS). Dungeons &amp; Dragons is also a popular theme for “very special” episodes of TV shows, including Community, Gravity Falls, The Big Bang Theory, and the series finale of Freaks &amp; Geeks. The game made its way to the big screen in 2000′ Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but it was both a box office and critical disappointment, despite the fact&nbsp;it was followed by two direct-to-video sequels. Movies have changed a lot in the last 16 years, however, and Warner Bros has been developing a Dungeons &amp; Dragons reboot for a while now. The most recent news was the hiring of director Rob Letterman, who had a Certified Fresh hit last year with his adaptation of Goosebumps,&nbsp;and now we can report that the first actor to formally be in talks to star in the new Dungeons and Dragons is Ansel Elgort, who is probably best known for starring in The Fault in Our Stars.&nbsp;(Elgort also made the news last year for being in the running to be cast as the new “Han Solo” before the prequel role went to Alden Ehrenreich). It’s not yet known what role Elgort will play in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, or whether long-rumored (and self-avowed D&amp;D player) cast possibility Vin Diesel will end up joining the film or not. It’s also unclear what popular game elements will be adapted, except that the screenplay by David Leslie Johnson (The Conjuring 2) is reportedly set in the popular Forgotten Realms campaign.4.&nbsp;VINNIE JONES TO PLAY DAPPER BRIT IN SPY SEQUEL KINGSMAN: THE GOLDEN CIRCLEFor his sequel to last year’s hit spy comics adaptation, Kingsman: The Secret Service, director Matthew Vaughn has in the last few months assembled quite the ensemble. In addition to returning stars Taron Egerton, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, and Edward Holcroft, Kingsman: The Golden Circle will introduce characters played by Julianne Moore (as the film’s main villain), Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Halle Berry, Pedro Pascal, and pop star Elton John. As impressive as that list is, this week, another star was revealed, namely&nbsp;Vinnie Jones, who has previously worked with Vaughn on Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch, both of which Vaughn produced.&nbsp;The exact nature of his&nbsp;character hasn’t been revealed yet, but via Twitter, Jones has revealed that he is wearing rather suave “Union Jack” shoes, suggesting that he may be playing a member of the British “Kingsman” elite order of spies. 20th Century Fox has scheduled Kingsman: The Golden Circle for release on June 16, 2017 (up against Pixar’s own sequel, Cars 3… ouch!).5. THIS WEEK IN DREAM MOVIES THAT PROBABLY WON’T HAPPEN: BatGIRL, WHITE CHICKS 2This is a shortened week in film development news, thanks to the upcoming 4th of July weekend (which means that many film development people and journalists have either taken the week off, or are refraining from making big announcements). As such, we’re going to indulge in something the Weekly Ketchup&nbsp;normally wouldn’t: two “dream project” type stories that arose from quotes from directors. The first (and probably the one you’re most likely to have already seen in your social media feed) involves enigmatic Danish auteur Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, Bronson, Valhalla Rising), who’s out promoting his latest film, The Neon Demon. While doing so, Refn confirmed that he indeed hopes to direct some sort of big budget studio movie, and specifically, Refn said, “You know what I want to do? I want to make Batgirl. Let’s get Warner working on it.” Before Christopher Nolan directed Batman Begins, he was similarly a director best known for work like Refn’s, so honestly, it’s not impossible. A similar dream project was mentioned this week by the directors behind the bizarre indie hit Swiss Army Man, who said this week that they would love to direct a sequel to the 2004 Wayans Brothers comedy White Chicks, which they would direct as their dramatic equivalent of Darren Aronofsky’s Requiem for a Dream, complete with “the same makeup team that made those exquisite white girl faces.” (Or maybe they were kidding.)6.&nbsp;MINECRAFT TO COMPETE WITH STAR WARS AND AVENGERS IN MAY, 2019As the home to something of a box office super-quadfecta with the rights to Star Wars, Marvel Studios, Pixar, and their own live-action fairy tale movies, Walt Disney Pictures is now very much in the position of being able to plant their own flags on future release calendars, challenging other studios to go up against them. For the “summer kickoff” month of May in 2019, Disney has already slated Avengers: Infinity War Part 2 (5/25/19) and Star Wars Episode IX (both titles likely to change). This week, Warner Bros revealed that their big Memorial Day release will be the video game adaptation Minecraft. It has been known for a while that Warner Bros was developing an adaptation of the popular “world building” game that first launched in 2011, but this release date moves Minecraft from remote possibility to within three years of release.&nbsp;Minecraft will mark the feature film directorial debut of Rob McElhenney, costar and creator of TV’s It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. If Minecraft is a box office success, it will also potentially give Warner Bros another animated franchise based on a popular game series, along with their various LEGO movies.7. JACKIE CHAN LEADS THE VOICE CAST OF NINJAGOEver since The LEGO Movie became one of the biggest box office hits of 2014, Warner Bros has been developing a new slate of LEGO-related movies, which include The LEGO Batman Movie (2/10/17), The LEGO Movie Sequel (2/8/19), and something called The Billion Brick Race (2019 or 2020). The fourth movie of this run will be an adaptation of the LEGO toy line Ninjago:&nbsp; Masters of Spinjitsu, which combines the fun of LEGO with the action and adventure of Japanese mythology and, well, ninjas. This week, we learned via the 2016 Licensing Expo which stars will be lending their voices to the Ninjago movie. Chinese action star Jackie Chan appears to be one of the film’s main stars, and he will be joined by the voices of Fred Armisen (TV’s Portlandia), Dave Franco (21 Jump Street), Abbi Jacobson (TV’s Broad City), Michael Peña (Ant-Man), and Silicon Valley costars Kumail Nanjiani and Zach Woods. The Ninjago movie will mark the feature film debut of Charlie Bean, who previously directed several episodes of TRON: Uprising and Robotboy.Rotten Idea of The Week1. TYRESE GIBSON RETURNING FOR TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHTSome movie franchises seem to have resigned themselves to the fact that they’ll only ever earn Rotten scores, and they keep chugging along.&nbsp;One example&nbsp;is the Transformers brand, which peaked at 57 percent with the first film and failed to&nbsp;top 20 percent with its&nbsp;two most recent entries. Undeterred, Michael Bay continues to churn them out, and this week, it was confirmed that Tyrese Gibson will return as his character, Chief Master Sergeant Robert Epps. Gibson appeared in the first three films, but took the fourth entry off (along with a few other cast members). Paramount Pictures has scheduled Transformers: The Last Knight for release on June 23, 2017, one week after the release of Cars 3 and Kingsman: The Golden Circle, which will both be released on June 16, 2017.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"kong, Awards, spanish, Critics, OWN, ghosts, Women's, aapi, A&E, game-of-thrones, Black, potter, PBS, cinematic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/30170741/Wreck-It-Ralph-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"disney-announces-sequel-to-wreck-it-ralph-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509190266259","title":"Emilia Clarke Joins the Han Solo Movie, and more Hollywood News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Emilia Clarke Joins the Han Solo Movie, and more Hollywood NewsAngela Bassett joins Black Panther, Dick Cheney gets a biopic, and reboots/remakes of Dune, Highlander, and Mortal Kombat are on the way.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 25, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). &nbsp;Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Black Panther, Dune, Highlander, Mortal Kombat, and the Dick Cheney biopic.This WEEK’S TOP STORYWILL HAN SOLO BE THE KHALEESI’S MOON AND STARS?You never&nbsp;know which way casting news is going to go on a big project, even if you’ve been following the casting calls. For example, it seemed like we had a pretty good idea who would play the female lead in the Han Solo spinoff prequel (5/25/18); the names we had heard were actresses Zoe Kravitz (X-Men: First Class), Tessa Thompson (Creed), and Naomi Scott (2017’s Power Rangers). That they are all women of color is part of why people guessed the role would be Sana Starros, which was never actually confirmed. The actress who has, in fact, landed this plum role opposite Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo) and Donald Glover (Lando Calrissian) is instead someone who we hadn’t heard was in the running at all. Emilia Clarke, AKA Daenerys Targaryen on Game of Thrones, has been cast as the female lead in the Han Solo movie, potentially as his romantic interest. This news brings us an update (not that it matters now that Clarke has the job) that other actresses who were considered included: Jessica Henwick (one of the Sand Snakes on Game of Thrones) and Latin American Adria Arjona (TV’s Person of Interest). Whatever this prequel ends up being called (we’re still partial to Han Solo: A Star Wars Story), it will be directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the guys behind 21 Jump Street and The LEGO Movie. In related news, it sounds like there won’t be an opening crawl on Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and by extension, maybe not on any of the “Star Wars Anthology” films (like the Han Solo movie).Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;ANGELA BASSETT JOINS BLACK PANTHER (AND THE MCU) AS T’CHALLA’S MOMWhen Angela Bassett starred as Amanda Waller in 2011’s Green Lantern, some Marvel fans were saddened at the thought it potentially discounted the possibility that the talented actress might ever be in an MCU movie. Those fans received some encouragement when Viola Davis took over the role in August’s Suicide Squad (and by extension, the rest of the DCEU movies, presumably), and now they really have a reason to be excited, because Bassett is joining the MCU after all! The Malcolm X costar and frequent&nbsp;American Horror Story star has signed on to appear&nbsp;in Black Panther (2/16/18) as the mother of T’Challa, the title character played by Chadwick Boseman. It’s worth noting that back in the 1990s, Bassett had reportedly been considered for the role of Storm in the X-Men franchise that went to Halle Berry instead. Filming of Black Panther will start in early 2017.2. HARRY POTTER&nbsp;PRODUCER TAMES POPULAR KIDS SERIES WARRIORS (IT’S ABOUT KITTIES!)Unless you have young kids or work in a library or book store, there’s a good chance&nbsp;you’ve never heard of the Warriors series. The franchise, which now stretches across dozens of books (36 to date!) written by four authors under the pseudonym “Erin Hunter,” is sort of a huge deal. The Warriors&nbsp;chronicles the tales of&nbsp;a group of cats who are engaged in several epic adventures. It’s sort of like the Redwall series, but with cats, and written slightly differently (in this writer’s opinion) to appeal to today’s kids. Regardless of whether or not you’ve heard of Warriors, the series is coming to movie theaters, probably as a multi-film franchise, and it looks like the choice of producer (and possible director for future sequels) will&nbsp;be a huge deal. Producer David Heyman (The Legend of Tarzan, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and the last few Harry Potter movies) has signed on to produce the first Warriors movie for the Chinese company Alibaba Pictures Group. Heyman is currently looking for both screenwriters and a director for the first Warriors movie and any potential sequels.3. THIS WEEK IN DUELING MOVIES: DISNEY’S CHRISTOPHER ROBIN GETS A DIRECTORThere are currently two live action adaptations of Winnie the Pooh, each racing to get made before the other.&nbsp;Before this week, we knew that Domhnall Gleeson (About Time, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) and Margot Robbie were attached to star in the British production, called Goodbye Christopher Robin. Well, Harley Quinn has competition from the Mouse House, because we learned this week that Disney’s own live action reboot of their Winnie the Pooh franchise is called just Christopher Robin,&nbsp;and to get that movie made, Walt Disney Pictures has hired frequently Certified Fresh director Marc Forster (Stranger Than Fiction, Finding Neverland, World War Z). Disney has also already hired screenwriter Alex Ross Perry to work on Christopher Robin. It’s not currently known which movie will start filming first, but as they say, “the game is afoot!”4. ANCHORMAN DIRECTOR TO TAKE ON THE (NEVER MORE TIMELY) DICK CHENEY BIOPICIt’s not unheard of for directors to change the direction of their film career, but few have made as drastic a shift as Adam McKay. Before last year, McKay was the director of such wacky comedies as Step Brothers and the two Anchorman movies, but then he directed The Big Short&nbsp;and started developing other topical/series dramas, like the one he’s planning about the Theranos controversy. Well, just two weeks after the also controversial 2016 presidential election results, Adam McKay is now developing a film that seems to fit right in with Hollywood’s mood about our next president. McKay is going to write and direct a biopic about the life of former Vice President Dick Cheney, to be produced by Brad Pitt.5. THERE CAN ONLY BE TWO: THE LONG-AWAITED HIGHLANDER REBOOT IS STILL IN THE WORKSIt’s now been over seven years since Summit Entertainment started development of their reboot of the Highlander, about a race of immortal warriors who seek to kill each other off. That original 1987 film, starring Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery, was quite lucrative, spawning four sequels, a long running TV series, and more. Well, the reboot seems closer to being realized with the news this week that Lionsgate has hired director Chad Stahelski, who codirected the first John Wick&nbsp;and recently wrapped filming his solo directorial debut on the sequel, John Wick: Chapter 2 (2/10/17). His former collaborator also received news of a big next project, with the confirmation (after being rumored/in talks) that David Leitch will be directing the Deadpool sequel (possibly called Deadpool and Cable). 20th Century Fox hasn’t given that sequel a release date yet, but it’s possibly one of these recently announced dates: November 2, 2018 or February 14, 2019 (Valentine’s Day!).6. MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY TO PLAY A DRUG DEALER’S DAD IN WHITE BOY RICKFrench director Yann Demange scored several awards, and twice as many nominations for his 2014 film titled ’71. For his second film, Demange is coming to the USA to direct a Detroit-set true story called White Boy Rick, about a drug dealer in the 1980s. You can read the original article which inspired this movie right here. We don’t yet know which young actor Demange will cast as the title character, but we know who’s probably going to play his dad. Matthew McConaughey is now in talks to play the father of White Boy Rick, “a blue-collar factory worker trying to keep his family together as the automotive industry collapses around him in Detroit.”7. LEGENDARY PICTURES ACQUIRES THE FILM AND RIGHTS TO THE DUNE EPICOne has to wonder if science fiction author Frank Herbert had any real idea what he was starting when he wrote the 1965 novel Dune, about the galactic struggle for control of a desert planet where a mind-altering (and space travel enabling) drug is produced by giant sandworms. Surely, like many sci-fi authors, Herbert probably&nbsp;anticipated writing sequels, but could he have imagined over twenty novels, a David Lynch movie, and two different SyFy mini-series? &nbsp;The idea of a Dune reboot (trying to fix what people perceive as “problems” with David Lynch’s 1984 film) has been kicked around for several years now, including a period when Arrival director Denis Villeneuve was considering doing it. We still don’t know of another director who might want to tackle Dune again, but we can report it will probably be produced by Legendary Pictures (Warcraft, 300, Godzilla), who has acquired the film and TV rights to Herbert’s first Dune novel, which begs the question of whether they also acquired the rights to any of those 20+ sequel novels.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. PREPARE TO FIGHT: MORTAL KOMBAT IS GETTING A REBOOTCThe Mortal Kombat video game adaptation franchise sort of came to a crashing halt with Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, which was both a critical&nbsp;and box office flop. Well, as of next year, that will have been 20 years ago, and New Line Cinema is preparing a return to the Mortal Kombat arena. One indication the studio received that Mortal Kombat had potential as a 21st century franchise was that fans continued to create YouTube video shorts, which attracted&nbsp;tens of millions of views. With that in mind, New Line has hired commercials director (Halo, PlayStation, Range Rover) Simon McQuoid to make his feature film directorial debut with the first Mortal Kombat reboot.1.&nbsp;PAUL W.S. ANDERSON WILL FOLLOW RESIDENT EVIL&nbsp;WITH&nbsp;MONSTER HUNTERThis January, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter will presumably bring an end to the popular video game adaptation franchise Resident Evil, some 15 years after it began. As for what Resident Evil producer and director Paul W.S. Anderson will do next, he and his associates already have plans. Anderson is currently in advanced talks with the video game publisher Capcom (also the company behind Resident Evil) about starting a new franchise based on the Monster Hunter games. &nbsp;The title is pretty self-explanatory.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Film, Sundance, Pictures, 2019, binge, Christmas, Travel, dogs, Office, Signature, CNN, cinematic, Epix","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/25151000/Emilia-Clarke1.jpg","slug":"emilia-clarke-joins-the-han-solo-movie-and-more-hollywood-news"},{"id":"47509191921059","title":"Channing Tatum is the Splash Remake’s Merman, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Channing Tatum is the Splash Remake's Merman, and More Movie NewsThe Secret Life of Pets and Fantastic Beasts both get sequels, Benedict Cumberbatch and Daisy Ridley score new roles, and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels gets a remake.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 5, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Peter Rabbit, The Secret Life of Pets 2, and remakes of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Papillon, and Splash.This WEEK’S TOP STORYCHANNING TATUM TO STAR IN GENDER-SWAPPED REMAKE OF SPLASHThis summer, there were lots of “Grr” sounds from fans of the original Ghostbusters directed at the new remake. The issue wasn’t so much that there was a new&nbsp;Ghostbusters, but that it&nbsp;was a “Gender Reversed Remake.” Since&nbsp;Ghostbusters wasn’t a critical or box office disappointment (Certified Fresh at 73 percent, and $112 million at the domestic box office), it’s not at all surprising that Hollywood appears to be developing more gender-swapped remakes. We’ve already known for a while about the fourth Ocean’s Eleven movie, which will feature a mostly female cast of&nbsp;stars like Sandra Bullock, Elizabeth Banks, and Mindy Kaling. This week brought stories of two more remakes&nbsp;(the second is down below) in which genders will be swapped, but this is definitely the one that received the most attention. Channing Tatum and his 22 Jump Street costar Jillian Bell are now attached to star in a remake of the 1984 hit comedy Splash, which starred&nbsp;Daryl Hannah as a mermaid named Madison&nbsp;and Tom Hanks as the human who fell in love with her. In the remake, Tatum will play the “merman,” while Bell will play the female version of Tom Hanks’ character, who was saved as a child by the mermaid/merman. The Splash remake doesn’t yet have a director announced, but it will be produced by Ron Howard’s Imagine Entertainment, which is currently in discussions with Walt Disney Pictures to distribute. The ever prolific Channing Tatum has several movies coming in the next few years (including Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Gambit, Logan Lucky, and the Jump Street-MiB crossover), and Jillian Bell will next be seen in the comedies Office Christmas Party, Fist Fight, and Rock That Body (with Ghostbusters star Kate McKinnon being in two of those).Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;$400 MILLION (AND COUNTING) COMMANDS SECRET LIFE OF PETS SEQUELOne of the stories you have probably heard over and over about movies this summer is about how many “box office disappointments” there have been. That’s partially true (especially for live action sequels), but it’s actually been a pretty great box office summer for horror movies and animated kids movies.&nbsp; For example, Illumination Entertainment had another big hit with The Secret Life of Pets, which since July 8th has earned over $308 million domestically and over $411 million globally (and that’s before even opening in most foreign markets). So, it should hardly be surprising that Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment are now actively developing a sequel. There’s no word yet about what the title will be, but one guess could be the more grammatically correct The Secret Lives of Pets (or maybe not). Although it hasn’t yet been confirmed yet that any of the voice cast will return, the announced producers, director, and screenwriter all worked on the first movie (along with some other people). Universal has already announced a release date for the Secret Life of Pets sequel, which will be July 13, 2018, which is the week after Marvel’s Ant-Man and the Wasp (7/6/18), the week before Fox’s anime adaptation Alita: Battle Angel (7/20/18), and two weeks before the Aquaman movie (7/27/18).&nbsp;The Secret Life of Pets is Certified Fresh with a Tomatometer score of 75 percent.2. SEQUEL ALREADY GREENLIT FOR J.K. ROWLING’S FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEMThe big story in publishing this week was the release of the print publication of the stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which, as one would expect, was very, very popular. Warner Bros and author J.K. Rowling have not yet announced any plans to adapt the two parts of the play into movies (though when they do, it will be hardly surprising). Instead, Warner Bros is currently focusing on the non-Potter spinoff franchise Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the first movie of which is scheduled for release this fall on November 18, 2016. It’s long been presumed that Warner Bros was planning on this being a new franchise (probably a trilogy), so this week’s news is something of a non-story, except maybe that it shows WB is confident. The studio&nbsp;has confirmed a release date of November 16, 2018 for the second Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them movie, with the third expected in November, 2020. That release date is one week after the new animated remake of How the Grinch Stole Christmas (11/9/18) and five days before Disney’s animated fairy tale Gigantic (about Jack romancing a girl giant) (11/21/18). The second movie will again be written by J.K. Rowling, directed by David Yates (The Legend of Tarzan, the last four Harry Potter movies), and star Eddie Redmayne as cryptozoology enthusiast Newt Scamander.3. THOUGHT YOUNG ADULT DYSTOPIAS WERE DONE?&nbsp; NO ONE TOLD DAISY RIDLEY OR&nbsp;CHAOS WALKINGOne of the biggest and most surprising recent stories in film development was the revelation that Lionsgate will be sending the fourth Divergent movie direct to TV, leading to a spinoff TV series. (Miles Teller, for one, stated he was “not sure” he would participate after being in the first three movies.) With The Hunger Games now wrapped, and several other recent dystopian YA novel adaptations faring poorly (The Giver, The Host, The 5th Wave), many pundits predicted that the trend was perhaps over. As it turns out, Lionsgate isn’t entirely ready to give up on the genre;&nbsp;the studio&nbsp;is moving forward with an adaptation of Chaos Walking, a novel by author Patrick Ness. Actress Daisy Ridley, who is best known for playing Rey in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, is also attached to star in Chaos Walking (and presumably, its two potential sequels). Set in “a dystopian world where all living creatures can hear each other’s thoughts,” the first Chaos Walking book (subtitled The Knife of Never Letting Go) is about a boy (and his dog) who is chased by the local townspeople until he meets a “strange and silent girl” (presumably played by Daisy Ridley). Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Edge of Tomorrow) is also already attached to direct, and it’s his RT Tomatometer that is keeping us from calling this particular project yet another “Rotten Idea.”4. CARPOOL KARAOKE STAR JAMES CORDEN TO VOICE PETER RABBITAlthough it’s just one part of The Late Late Show with James Corden, in the last year, the Carpool Karaoke&nbsp;segment has become something of a regular internet sensation, with host James Corden joined by such celebrated singers as Adele, Stevie Wonder, Selena Gomez, Sia, Mariah Carey, and recently, First Lady Michelle Obama. Outside television (and viral videos), James Corden has also appeared in several films, including Begin Again, Into the Woods, and this fall’s Trolls. This week, we learned that Corden’s next big film role will be&nbsp;the long awaited Hollywood adaptation of one of British literature’s most popular children’s characters, Peter Rabbit. Corden has signed on with Sony Animation to provide the voice for Beatrix Potter’s beloved character in a live action/CGI hybrid adaptation. Peter Rabbit himself&nbsp;will be animated, while the rest of the world —&nbsp;including a human character for which Rose Byrne is currently in negotiations — will be live action (and modern/contemporary).&nbsp;Peter Rabbit will be directed by Will Gluck&nbsp;(Easy A, Friends with Benefits), who most recently worked with Sony on their remake of Annie.5.&nbsp;ROGUEISH, MASCULINE BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH TO BE ROGUE MALEEarlier this year, Benedict Cumberbatch raced from filming Marvel’s Doctor Strange in New York City back to England, where he very soon started filming the three installments&nbsp;of the next season of Sherlock. Now, as that process&nbsp;nears completion, Cumberbatch has signed on for another project (in addition to his commitments to appear in more Marvel movies),&nbsp;namely&nbsp;an adaptation of the “classic British novel” Rogue Male, by author Geoffrey Household. In the original novel, published in 1939, a British hunter attempts to assassinate a dictator (basically, Hitler), but his effort fails, as he is “caught, tortured, and left for dead.” The screenplay will be adapted by screenwriter Michael Lesslie, who recently adapted the version of MacBeth starring Michael Fassbender.6. ANSEL ELGORT (AND ANSEL ELGORT) TO STAR AS TWINS IN INDIE DRAMA JONATHANAnsel Elgort (The Fault in Our Stars, Divergent) has signed to star in an independent drama called Jonathan for director Bill Oliver, who will be making his feature film debut after previously directing three short films. Elgort will play two identical twin brothers, named Jonathan and John, whose agreement to not have girlfriends is challenged when the less responsible of the two (layabout-John) falls in love with a woman (who hasn’t yet been cast). Ansel Elgort also has a few other films on the way, including Billionaire Boys Club, November Criminals, Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver, and the ambitious reboot of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.7.&nbsp;CHARLIE HUNNAM AND RAMI MALEK TO STAR IN THE PAPILLON REMAKEHollywood isn’t giving up anytime soon on its commitment to remakes, but not all of them reverse the genders of the original characters. For example, the remake of 1973’s Papillon won’t be set in a women’s prison. Instead, the roles originally played by Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman will be played, respectively, by Charlie Hunnam (Pacific Rim, Sons of Anarchy) and Rami Malek (Mr. Robot, HBO’s The Pacific). The original Papillon was based on the memoirs of a convicted felon, Henri Charriere, who staged an escape from France’s “Devil’s Island” penal colony, but this remake will have a modern setting, which presumably means it will be an escape from some other prison (since that colony doesn’t exist anymore).ROTTEN IDEAS&nbsp;OF THE WEEK2. REBEL WILSON TO STAR IN REMAKE OF DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS (WHICH WAS ALSO A REMAKE)The current king of remakes is MGM, which has a rich back catalog (though it’s not like every other studio doesn’t also have a back catalog) and whose recent efforts in that department include RoboCop, Hercules, Poltergeist, and in the near future, Ben-Hur, The Magnificent Seven, and Going in Style. Some actors and actresses even have multiple remakes they’re working on. Rebel Wilson (Bridesmaids, Pitch Perfect), for example, is attached to star in a remake of the Goldie Hawn military comedy Private Benjamin, and this week, she signed on for another. Wilson and MGM are now developing a new version&nbsp;of the 1988 comedy Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, which was itself a remake of the 1964 comedy Bedtime Story. Marlon Brando and David Niven starred in the first version, while Michael Caine and Steve Martin starred in the second. The first two movies were about pairs of con men trying to swindle an heiress out of her money, and the “gender reversed remake” (GRR) will be about two female con artists attempting to deprive a “naive tech prodigy out of his fortune.” It’s not yet known which actress will be joining Rebel Wilson as her partner in crime. We’re calling this one a “Rotten Idea” based on Rebel Wilson’s Tomatometer, which, outside of Bridesmaids and the two Pitch Perfect movies, is otherwise entirely Rotten.1. THIS WEEK IN DEPARTURES: ANGELINA JOLIE PITT, BARBRA STREISAND, AND THE STRANGER THINGS CREWThe Weekly Ketchup ostensibly covers ten “stories” each week, but occasionally, we cheat a bit by covering multiple stories at once. This week, there were a couple of headlines about projects hitting snags in their development, and none of them are great news (for people previously excited), so let’s run through all of them&nbsp;right now, shall we? The biggest news&nbsp;was probably the revelation that Angelina Jolie Pitt will not be starring in Kenneth Branagh’s remake of Murder on the Orient Express, as had been previously reported (she had never technically signed on). Branagh is still attached to direct, and star as Hercule Poirot, and Fox is still scheduling the remake for release on November 22, 2017, but the studio is looking for another big actress to replace AJP, with Charlize Theron considered one of the top contenders. This was also not a great week if you had been excited about Barbra Steisand’s return to the director’s chair with&nbsp;a new adaptation of the musical Gypsy. The project was dropped by STX Entertainment, the relatively new distributor which had picked up Gypsy out of turnaround from Universal Pictures. Although the expression is that the “third time is the charm,” in film development, it would be very unusual for a movie project like this to have a third home (though nothing’s impossible). “All they need is the girl.” Our last story is really 44 separate stories, because the movie blog Collider scored something of a coup this week while covering the Netflix series Stranger Things. They were able to get director/producer Shawn Levy and his partner to field questions about almost their entire development slate.&nbsp;As mentioned, 44&nbsp;movies were discussed, which is way more than we can get into here, but there are a few projects previously covered by the Weekly Ketchup that Levy has confirmed are now “dead.” They include: How to Talk to Girls (the adaptation of the “book” written by a nine-year-old), the Hardy Boys quasi-sequel Hardy Men, the animated version of King Kong, and the Will Smith project The City That Sailed.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"the, Film, of, Comics","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/05162147/Channing-Tatum-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"channing-tatum-is-the-splash-remakes-merman-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509191886237","title":"Stan Lee’s Story Will Be Told as a 1970s Action Flick, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Stan Lee's Story Will Be Told as a 1970s Action Flick, and More Movie NewsBenicio del Toro headlines the new Predator, Tom Hanks returns to WWII, Billy Crudup is The Flash's dad, and The Toxic Avenger and High Noon get remakes.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 16, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). &nbsp;Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as The Flash, The Predator, Stan Lee, and The Toxic Avenger.This WEEK’S TOP STORYFACE FRONT, TRUE BELIEVER! MARVEL’S STAN LEE TO GET HIS OWN MOVIEPretty much every year, various box office lists come out with the top-grossing actors and actresses. Generally, people think they are talking about starring roles (and usually, they are), and a common #1 answer is Samuel L. Jackson (mostly because of his roles as Mace Windu and Nick Fury). More surprising,&nbsp;though, is that&nbsp;the #2 answer (and he’s barely #2) is Stan Lee, who has appeared in cameo roles in dozens of Marvel Comics adaptations, starting (not counting TV movies) with his role in 2000’s X-Men as “Hot Dog Vendor.” There has been a debate since the 1960s about exactly how much credit Lee deserves compared to his two main cocreators, Steve Ditko (Amazing Spider-Man, Doctor Strange) and Jack Kirby (almost everything else). One edge that Lee gave Marvel over his Distinguished Competition (DC) is that he served as a public face for the comics in a way that DC never had. Eventually, Stan Lee will no longer be with us (he’s 93 now), but this week brought news that one of the studios that has benefited most from his cameos is working on paying him another cinematic homage. Twentieth Century Fox has acquired the film rights to Stan Lee’s life, although the project is not described as being a true biopic. Instead, the Stan Lee movie will be an “action movie” set in the 1970s, reportedly in the style of 007 actor Roger Moore and other “dapper heroes who quipped one-liners — and, in Moore’s case, flirted with the ladies — as they sparred with larger-than-life evildoers.” Stan Lee and his POW! Entertainment partner Gil Champion will executive produce the film, which will also be produced by Marty Bowen and Wyck Godfrey, the producers behind the Twilight and Maze Runner YA franchises. It is not yet known what sort of access this film will have to the Marvel Comics characters that Fox does not have the film rights to (Spider-Man, The Avengers, The Incredible Hulk, etc), or if the film will focus more on those that they do have: Fantastic Four and X-Men. No screenwriter has been hired yet to work on Fox’s Stan Lee yet, so it’s also possible that the eventual film may turn out quite differently.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;GET TO THE CHOPPA! BENICIO DEL TORO TO STAR IN THE PREDATORThe Predator sci-fi film franchise can be a little&nbsp;confusing, because not all of the later films necessarily acknowledged some of the previous films. The two most recent films (2007’s Aliens vs Predator – Requiem and 2010’s Predators) were also relative box office disappointments, especially when the earlier films are adjusted for inflation. Possibly for both of those reasons, 20th Century Fox has been developing a fresh reboot for a while now, to be directed by Shane Black (Iron Man 3, The Nice Guys) from a script by Fred Dekker (The Monster Squad, Night of the Creeps). (Quick trivia: Shane Black also costarred as Hawkins in the original Predator in 1987.) The original Predator was set in a jungle in Central America as U.S. commandos are stalked by an alien hunter, but we don’t know yet how closely the reboot will follow that film’s premise. What we do know now, however, is that apparently one of the leads will be a Benicio del Toro-type, because, well, Benicio del Toro is in talks to star in The Predator. Del Toro is also signed to costar in Star Wars Episode VIII (scheduled for December 15, 2017). 20th Century Fox has scheduled The Predator for release on February 9, 2018.2.&nbsp;SAVING PRIVATE RYAN + CAPTAIN PHILLIPS = TOM HANKS’ GREYHOUND?Although Tom Hanks is now sort of synonymous with movies based on true stories (such as last week’s Sully), Hanks actually appeared in over twenty movies before his first such film, 1995’s Apollo 13. A few years later, he starred&nbsp;in Saving Private Ryan, which would begin his association with World War II, leading to his&nbsp;co-producing Band of Brothers and The Pacific, both for HBO.&nbsp; (Incidentally, Hanks and Steven Spielberg are also developing a third HBO miniseries called Masters of the Air, focusing on bomber crews over Nazi Germany.) Tom Hanks’ dedication to telling World War II stories appears set to continue on the big screen as well, with the news this week that he&nbsp;has written a WWII-set screenplay called Greyhound. Hanks’ Playtone Pictures is producing, and he&nbsp;has an eye toward starring in this film about a “career officer given command of a Navy destroyer… who has to deal with combat enemies and his own self doubts.” This film (like Saving Private Ryan) appears not to be a completely “true story,” as there was no Naval destroyer during World War II called Greyhound. Aaron Schneider (2009’s Get Low) is attached to direct.3. THE MARTIAN + SULLY + APOLLO 13 = ASTRONAUT SCOTT KELLY’S ENDURANCE?The movie has only been in theaters for one week, but Sully already appears to be one of the fall season’s early (relative) hits, having opened to $35 million (which was double digits above some predictions). It was also only one year ago that the near-future astronaut drama The Martian was a much bigger box office hit in the autumn of 2015. Hollywood is very much in the business of trying to read tea leaves (and box office numbers) to try to predict what similar films might be future successes. So, if one combines the true story of Sully with the (fictional, obviously) astronaut “endurance” story of The Martian, there are only so many possible film ideas that could be adapted. One of them is the true story of astronaut Scott Kelly, whose upcoming book Endurance: My Year in Space has been picked up in auction by Sony Pictures. In addition to sharing a year-long special mission on the International Space Station with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, Scott Kelly has an identical twin brother Mark Kelly, himself also a former astronaut. So, whichever actor eventually stars in Endurance will probably play both Mark and Scott. Former Representative Gabrielle Giffords (who herself has a harrowing true story) is also Scott Kelly’s sister-in-law, and is serving as a consultant on this film adaptation. If you’re looking forward to reading Endurance: My Year in Space, you have a bit of a wait in front of you, as Knopf won’t publish it until November, 2017.4.&nbsp;SAUSAGE PARTY CO-DIRECTOR TO REMAKE SUPERHERO SPOOF THE TOXIC AVENGERThe argument can be made that Troma’s ultra-low-budget 1984 superhero spoof The Toxic Avenger was way, way ahead of its time, mocking Marvel superheroes like The Incredible Hulk and Spider-Man before either of those characters had themselves been adapted to the big screen. The idea of reviving The Toxic Avenger has been kicking around in development news circles for a few years now, but this week brought the project to its next logical step towards production. With Sausage Party on its way to crossing the $100 million box office mark (currently at $94 million), that film’s codirector, Conrad Vernon, has signed on to direct the remake of The Toxic Avenger. Like Sausage Party, the original The Toxic Avenger is very much an R-rated comedy, setting the model for Troma’s over-the-top gore and gross-out prop humor. Like the previous films, this remake of The Toxic Avenger will tell the story of a “New Jersey teenager whose accidental tumble into a vat of toxic waste turns him into a mutant superhero.” In addition to Sausage Party, director Conrad Vernon has also worked on DreamWorks’ Shrek 2, Monsters vs Aliens, and Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted, all of which received Fresh Tomatometer scores (as did the Certified Fresh&nbsp;Sausage Party).5.&nbsp;EVA GREEN TO STAR IN ROMAN POLANSKI’S BASED ON A TRUE STORY (NOT REALLY A TRUE STORY)Now aged 83, exiled director Roman Polanski continues to work in Europe, three years after his most recent film, 2013’s Venus in Furs. Polanski’s next film will be called Based on a True Story (the international title is D’Apres Une Histoire Vraie), although it is indeed a fictional film. Based on a True Story will be a psychological thriller about a writer played by Emmanuelle Seigner “whose life and mind are endangered by an obsessive woman,” to be played by Eva Green, who&nbsp;appears to be returning to more of a focus on feature films after the recent cancellation of her Showtime drama Penny Dreadful after three seasons. Green will soon be seen as the title character in Tim Burton’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children&nbsp;when it reaches theaters on September 30, 2016.6.&nbsp;WATCHMEN STAR BILLY CRUDUP CAST AS THE FLASH‘S DADAs producer and showrunner Greg Berlanti put together The Flash for the CW in 2014, he was very careful to connect the show to the original 1990s The Flash TV series (as well as the CW’s Arrow). The most obvious connection between the two shows was the casting of John Wesley Shipp (the star of the 1990s show) as Barry Allen’s incarcerated father Dr. Harry Allen. This move also helped to establish the CW’s The Flash as being very much a “family drama,” in addition to being a superhero one. As Warner Bros continues development of their new DC Extended Universe with The Flash (3/16/18), there are a few pieces that they seem to be borrowing from the CW, even if they’re sticking with Ezra Miller over Grant Gustin. One of those was the choice to keep Iris West as an African American character (she’s traditionally Caucasian in the comics), to be played by Kiersey Clemons, who previously worked with director Rick Famuyiwa on Dope. And as you can gather, it looks like Famuyiwa’s The Flash will be using Barry Allen’s father as a central character. Billy Crudup, who previously worked with WB and DC on their adaptation of Alan Moore’s Watchmen (as Dr. Manhattan), is now in talks to join The Flash as Barry Allen’s father. Warner Bros is still keeping the premise of The Flash “under wraps,” so it’s possible that other characters from the CW show might also be incorporated in the March 16th, 2018 movie version.7.&nbsp;FOX ANIMATION ANNOUNCES ZITA THE SPACEGIRL AND LITTLEST BIGFOOTEarlier this year, NBCUniversal announced its acqusition of DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion, which will add to Universal’s upcoming animation production slate through Illumination Entertainment (Sing, The Secret Life of Pets). DreamWorks Animation will continue to work on the films they had committed to 20th Century Fox through the year 2018, which will include the upcoming films Trolls (11/4/16), The Boss Baby (3/31/17), Captain Underpants (6/2/17), Larrikins (2/16/18), and How to Train Your Dragon 3 (5/18/18). After 2018, however, 20th Century Fox will have to expand its own animation efforts to replace the films that DreamWorks currently produces. That, at least, is what Fox Animation appears to be doing, with the news just this week alone of two new projects being put into development. The first such new animated project this week is an adaptation of the Zita the Spacegirl trilogy of children’s books by Ben Hatke.&nbsp;Variety describes the Zita the Spacegirl books as being about the title character as “she leaps to the rescue when her best friend is abducted by an alien doomsday cult — taking on humanoid chickens, ancient prophecies, doomed planets, and a mystery man who takes a secret interest in her quests along the way.” It’s not yet known if the first Zita the Spacegirl movie will adapt all three books, or only the first book’s story. Fox Animation is also now developing an adaptation of the Jennifer Weiner children’s book The Littlest Bigfoot. That book was just published this week, with a sequel called Little Bigfoot, Big City, scheduled for publication in November of 2017.&nbsp;The Littlest Bigfoot tells the story of two girls, one human, the other a “Bigfoot,” who become friends. Jennifer Weiner’s book In Her Shoes was previously adapted as the movie starring Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, and Shirley MacLaine.ROTTEN IDEAS&nbsp;OF THE WEEK2. STEVEN SPIELBERG’S THE KIDNAPPING OF EDGARDO MORTARA GETS NEW COMPETITIONThe amount of time it takes for movies to make their way through development means that producers sometimes engage in what is known as “duelling movies,” in which the same basic concept is developed as separate movies, competing with each other to see which can be finished first, and with the most success. This year, for example, there was Zootopia and then The Secret Life of Pets; and also The Jungle Book followed by The Legend of Tarzan. We’ve known for a while now that Steven Spielberg is planning on making his next two films the sci-fi adventure Ready Player One (currently filming for 3/30/18) and the drama The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara. The latter will be an adaptation of the true story, set in the 1850s and 1860s, of a young Jewish boy raised by the Catholic Church “under the protection” of Pope Pius IX (and who grows up to himself to become a Catholic priest). At one point, Steven Spielberg and producer Harvey Weinstein reportedly were considering working together on the film, but this week, the news broke that The Weinstein Company is moving forward with its own adaptation of the Edgardo Mortara story.&nbsp;Since Spielberg hasn’t started filming his movie yet, that means the earliest his film could likely be released would be late 2018, giving Weinstein’s film enough time to itself be filmed and possibly be released before Spielberg’s. Balthasar Kormakur (Everest, The Deep) is now in talks to direct, with Robert De Niro being eyed for playing Pope Pius IX (who will be played by Mark Rylance in Spielberg’s version). We’re calling this one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas,” because this particular play feels&nbsp;a little like gamesmanship on the part of The Weinstein Company, right?1. THIS WEEK IN REMAKES: THE CLASSIC WESTERN HIGH NOON&nbsp;Next week sees the release of the remake of The Magnificent Seven (which was itself a remake of The Seven Samurai), starring Chris Pratt and Denzel Washington. Some box office pundits are already predicting that the remake will be one of the biggest pre-Thanksgiving hits, so apparently, other producers are looking at other westerns that could be remade as well. But when it comes to remaking classic films, how classic is too classic? For example, when the Ben-Hur remake was released last month, audiences did not turn out for a new version (and neither did critics). Consider, for example, the 1952 Gary Cooper film High Noon (about a marshal awaiting the arrival of a group of killers he has little chance of surviving), which regularly appears on “greatest” lists (sometimes as the greatest western of all time). Well, as you can gather from all of this, someone in Hollywood is indeed now developing a remake of High Noon, with the setting being changed to a modern day town near the Texas/Mexico border. The production company behind these plans for a High Noon remake is Relativity Studios, which earlier this year emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings. Relativity’s first film since bankruptcy was last week’s The Disappointments Room, which was not only a box office “disappointment,” but also the rare film to earn a Tomatometer goose-egg of 0%.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"streaming, Endgame","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16131356/Stan-Lee-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"stan-lees-story-will-be-told-as-a-1970s-action-flick-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509191891358","title":"Joe Manganiello Will Be Batfleck’s Deathstroke, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Joe Manganiello Will Be Batfleck's Deathstroke, and More Movie NewsNew projects for Alfonso Cuarón, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling, Johnny Depp, Julianne Moore, and Jeff Nichols, plus a Shanghai sequel.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 9, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Alien Nation, Booster Gold, LAbyrinth, A Wrinkle in Time, and the sequel Shanghai Dawn.This WEEK’S TOP STORYJOE MANGANIELLO TO TERMINATE IN BEN AFFLECK’S SOLO BATMANBig, ambitious superhero movies have a tendency to&nbsp;inspire&nbsp;fan rumors and speculation, much of which&nbsp;turns out to be untrue. Every once in a while, though, there’s an exception. For this week’s top story, we have to go back to early 2015, when Warner Bros and DC Comics were casting last month’s Suicide Squad. At the time, there was talk about Joe Manganiello (Magic Mike, HBO’s True Blood) being in the running to play Slade Wilson,&nbsp;AKA Deathstroke the Terminator. The reasoning was that Manganiello had been in director David Ayer’s 2014 film Sabotage, so the two were going to work on Suicide Squad together as well; Manganiello obviously was not in Suicide Squad, and neither was Slade Wilson/Deathstroke.&nbsp;Fast forward to last week, when Ben Affleck posted a teaser video of “someone” playing Deathstroke, which was quickly confirmed to be for Affleck’s solo Batman (and possibly Justice League in 2017?). Well, there’s still no indication that Deathstroke will be in Justice League, but this week, Joe Manganiello was indeed confirmed&nbsp;as Batfleck’s Slade Wilson. Some sources have also described Deathstroke as being the “main villain” in the Batman solo movie, while others have claimed that “just about every major bad guy you’ve ever wanted to see” will be in the film (though it’s possible both claims could be non-exclusively true). As for the character, he’s a villain-turned-antihero originally most associated in the 1980s with New Teen Titans (the team with Cyborg, Raven, Nightwing, etc), who, like many popular comics characters, later branched out into other heroes’ adventures. And if that name “Slade Wilson” sounds familiar, it might be because Rob Liefeld created Marvel’s Deadpool (AKA Wade Wilson) as something of an “homage” to DC’s Deathstroke. There’s still no release date for Affleck’s solo movie as Batman, but it’s looking more and more like Warner Bros might be slotting it for sometime in 2018, with filming to possibly start sometime in 2017.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;GRAVITY DIRECTOR ALFONSO CUARÓN’S NEXT FILM REVEALEDDirector Alfonso Cuarón&nbsp;at this point is probably best known for his (relatively) big budget work on such films as Gravity, Children of Men, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, so it’s perhaps understandable if one isn’t familiar with&nbsp;his work in his native Mexico. Indeed, it has now been 15 years since Cuarón’s last Mexican film, 2001’s Y Tu Mama Tambien. This week, we learned that he&nbsp;will soon return to Mexico for his next film, which is scheduled to start production later this year. Although the film does not yet have a title, it will be about a “a year in the life of a middle-class family in Mexico City in the early 1970s.” Cuarón was born in 1961 (in Mexico City), so there is a good chance this film will be at least partly autobiographical (or at least influenced by his family and childhood). He&nbsp;has worked a few times in the past with Warner Bros (A Little Princess, Gravity, HP&amp;TPoA), but this next film will be produced by Participant Media (Spotlight, Bridge of Spies, Deepwater Horizon).2. MINDY KALING AND&nbsp;REESE WITHERSPOON&nbsp;JOIN OPRAH IN A WRINKLE IN TIMEAfter the critical and box office success of 2014’s Selma, director Ava DuVernay quickly became one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood.&nbsp;She was approached for Marvel’s Black Panther and DreamWorks’ science fiction film Intelligent Life,&nbsp;both of which she departed or turned down. Instead of working with Marvel, Ava DuVernay instead signed with their parent company, Walt Disney Pictures, to direct their adaptation of the classic Madeleine L’Engle children’s book A Wrinkle in Time. Oprah Winfrey became the first actress to sign on for A Wrinkle in Time, as the mysterious Mrs. Which, but her companions remained uncast until this week. Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling are both in talks to costar with Oprah as Mrs. Whatsit (Witherspoon) and Mrs. Who (Kaling). If A Wrinkle in Time is successful, it’s very possible/likely that Disney will eventually want to adapt the other three books in L’Engle’s “Time Quintet,” which are A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet,&nbsp;Many Waters, and An Acceptable Time. As for A Wrinkle in Time itself, it’s about a group of children who “travel through time and visit strange worlds in order to find their missing scientist father.” Walt Disney Pictures has not yet announced a release date for A Wrinkle in Time, but there is an Untitled Disney Live Action Film scheduled for August 3, 2018, which (through process of elimination) might be A Wrinkle in Time.3. THIS WEEK IN REMAKES: MIDNIGHT SPECIAL DIRECTOR JOINS ALIEN NATIONOne common theory about remakes&nbsp;among&nbsp;some movie fans suggests&nbsp;that the best candidates are films that weren’t so&nbsp;great the first time around (or at best, were “mediocre”). Consider, for example, the 1988 sci-fi cop movie Alien Nation, starring James Caan and Mandy Patinkin as mismatched partners (Caan’s a human who dislikes aliens, Patinkin’s an alien) who, within 90 minutes, become good friends and team up to take down an evil human drug dealer.&nbsp;Alien Nation has a Rotten Tomatometer score of 54 percent, but it did manage to get a FOX TV series spinoff that ran for one season in 1989-1990. As such, 20th Century Fox arguably has a legitimate reason to revisit Alien Nation, since it’s one of the franchises currently&nbsp;gathering dust in their back catalog. Coming off something of a disappointment with&nbsp;his recent science fiction film Midnight Special&nbsp;— which&nbsp;did not find much of a theatrical audience&nbsp;— director Jeff Nichols (Mud, Take Shelter)&nbsp;has signed with Fox to write and direct a remake of Alien Nation, to be produced by two of his partners on his upcoming period romance&nbsp;Loving, which is being released this November.&nbsp; At this early point, there has obviously been no casting yet, but Michael Shannon has starred (or co-starred) in all five of Nichols’ films as director, so one would have to guess that he’s probably got a good shot at one of the two leads (possibly as alien Detective Sam Francisco?).4. WINSTON CHURCHILL DRAMA DARKEST HOUR CASTS HURT, MENDELSOHN, SCOTT-THOMASEarlier this year, Gary Oldman was cast by Focus Features as Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the historical drama Darkest Hour. The film will take place during 1940, in the months after Churchill became prime minister, as he had to deal with the fall of France to the Nazi invasion and the start of the German bombing of England. Production is scheduled to start later this year in England, and this week, we learned of&nbsp;three more actors who will be playing historical figures in Darkest Hour. John Hurt will play Churchill’s predecessor Neville Chamberlain (who promised “peace for our time” with Hitler); Lily James (Lady Rose from Downton Abbey) will be playing Churchill’s personal secretary; and Kristin Scott Thomas will play his wife Clementine. Those four Brits will be joined by Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn, who will play King George VI, who was recently the focus of the film The King’s Speech.&nbsp;Darkest Hour will be directed by Joe Wright, who is looking for a critical hit after floundering last year with Pan (Wright’s previous Fresh films include Pride and Prejudice, Atonement, Hanna, and Anna Karenina). Focus Features has scheduled Darkest Hour for release on November 24, 2017, so they are clearly expecting Darkest Hour to be one of their “awards seasons” films next year.5. JOHNNY DEPP TO STAR IN LABYRINTH (WHICH IS NOT A DAVID BOWIE REMAKE)There are only so many words in the English language, and many of the ones that make for great one-word movie titles are already taken. For example, David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly starred in the 1986 fantasy Labyrinth, but does that necessarily mean that no other film can ever use that title? Or can this conundrum be resolved through creative capitalization? If, say, your movie is set in Los Angeles, maybe you can call it&nbsp;LAbyrinth, which obviously is nothing like Labyrinth at all. We’re talking specifically about an adaptation of Randall Smith’s non-fiction book LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., the Implication of Death Row Records’ Suge Knight, and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal. We just love it when book titles basically do most of the writing for us, so all that’s left to mention now is that Johnny Depp is “circling” the lead role in LAbyrinth, which is LAPD homicide detective Russell Poole. As the title indicates, Detective Poole investigated the murders of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls (The Notorious B.I.G.), and the implication of Death Row Records’ Suge Knight, all of which was possibly the origin of the Los Angeles police scandal.&nbsp;LAbyrinth will be directed by Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer, Runner Runner), whose latest film was this summer’s The Infiltrator, also based on a law enforcement true story.6. JULIANNE MOORE JOINS BEL CANTO FROM THE DIRECTOR OF LITTLE FOCKERSWhen author Ann Patchett published her novel Bel Canto in 2001, its setting of South America in the mid-1990s was only a few years old, but the adaptation of the book&nbsp;has taken so long now that it’s going to end up being a period piece (unless it’s given a contemporary setting, of course).&nbsp;Bel Canto is one of the movies that’s being shopped around to financiers and distributors at the Toronto International Film Festival this week, and as such, we know much more about the project. Julianne Moore is attached to star, along with Demian Bichir (Savages, The Hateful Eight) and Ken Watanabe (Batman Begins, The Last Samurai). Moore will play an American opera singer who travels to a South American nation under the rule of a dictator to give a private concert for a wealthy Japanese industrialist (Watanabe) whose estate is then invaded by guerrilas (led by Bichir’s character).&nbsp;Bel Canto will be directed by Paul Weitz whose filmography includes a few high points (American Pie, About a Boy, In Good Company, Grandma), but more Rotten scores (Down to Earth, American Dreamz, Cirque du Freak, Little Fockers, Being Flynn, Admission).ROTTEN IDEAS&nbsp;OF THE WEEK3.&nbsp;WRESTLER CHRIS BENOIT TO RECEIVE BIOPIC FROM PUNISHER: WAR ZONE DIRECTORChris Benoit was a popular professional wrestler for 22 years (1985-2007) who held several championships, and his signature submission move was called the “crippler crossface.” Benoit also strangled his wife and 7-year-old son before hanging himself using a weight lifting machine in 2007. Similarly to the&nbsp;2014 drama Foxcatcher, which depicted a murder-suicide involving Olympic wrestling competitors and their coaches, Chris Benoit’s life and death will also be adapted as a feature film called Crossface, and it will be directed by Lexi Alexander (Green Street Hooligans, Punisher: War Zone). As one of the few female directors working in Hollywood with action experience, Lexi Alexander had at one time been a popular fan choice to direct Wonder Woman (and she commented about it in 2014). Unfortunately, Alexander’s two film credits to date both have Rotten Tomatometer scores, which is why we’re calling this one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.2. BOOSTER GOLD WILL NOT BE PART OF THE DC EXTENDED UNIVERSENot counting Fox’s Fantastic Four or X-Men movies, most of Marvel’s movies are now living in the same “Marvel Cinematic Universe,” which means that characters like Captain America, Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and Ant-Man all live in the same world. Over at Marvel’s distinguished competition, DC Comics, the movies have much less of a history of co-existing (despite most of them being at the same studio, Warner Bros). This is something that Warner Bros has been rather famously&nbsp;trying to correct, starting with Man of Steel, and continuing with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad, and next year’s Wonder Woman and Justice League. These films have also shared a “grimdark” tone (something that critics have cited in their negative reviews). So, when it was revealed about a year ago that WB and DC were adapting the popular superhero Booster Gold as a movie, many fans got quite excited, because Booster Gold represents a lighter tone arguably more similar to some of Marvel’s movies. (That Greg Berlanti, the producer responsible for TV shows like The Flash, was working on it, was seen in the same vein.) In the comics Booster Gold is a frustrated ex-sports star living in Gotham City in the 25th century who “borrows” equipment from a superhero museum so that he can travel back in time and become a superhero superstar in the past (our present). Ostensibly, the Booster Gold movie was seen by some as an opportunity to bring levity to DC’s superheroes, as Booster Gold could maybe crossover with his fellow heroes&nbsp;and help change their films’ tones. This week, however, Greg Berlanti revealed that, “As of right now we have no connective tissue to those worlds… it’ll be a separate thing.” So, we’re calling this a Rotten Idea, because even if Booster Gold itself is a great, fun, movie, the opportunity for the other DC Extended Universe movies to also be fun is basically being sidestepped. It’s also unclear what heroes Booster Gold will be inspired by if his own movie isn’t connected to the DCEU (though the best guess would be other characters WB and DC don’t plan on ever adapting to the big screen).1. FOURTEEN YEARS AFTER SHANGHAI KNIGHTS, WAKE UP FOR SHANGHAI DAWN &nbsp;In 2000, Jackie Chan was at the height of his career as a martial arts action movie star and looking for his next big American crossover hit. So he starred with Owen Wilson in a western adventure comedy called Shanghai Noon, which made just enough money ($56 million domestic) to spawn a sequel in 2003 called Shanghai Knights. And then… it seemed like that was that. Over time, Chan focused more on making his films in China, as he (now 62) and Owen Wilson (now 47) continued to do that inconvenient human thing where they continue to age. Thirteen years later, Chinese box office is bigger than it’s ever been, and producers in China are continuing to look for projects that will allow them to work both domestically and with Hollywood movie stars (such as Matt Damon in The Great Wall). This brings us back to Shanghai Noon, and the ostensible trilogy that was never finished after Shanghai Knights. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are now in talks to reprise their roles in the third film, Shanghai Dawn. The director is already set, and it’s going to be Jared Hess, whose debut film remains his most famous: Napoleon Dynamite. That Sundance hit received a Fresh Tomatometer score, but Hess has not been able to replicate that, with Nacho Libre (40 percent), Gentlemen Broncos (19 percent), and Don Verdean (30 percent) all receiving Rotten scores. Shanghai Noon was Certified Fresh at 79 percent, and Shanghai Knights was also Fresh at 66 percent, but the expiration date on this trilogy may have already passed.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"nbcuniversal, The, Election, Comics, Diego, Turner, Chernobyl, cinematic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/09165401/Manganiello-Deathstroke-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"joe-manganiello-will-be-batflecks-deathstroke-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509193448871","title":"Hollywood Is Officially Hunting for Pokemon Go Rights, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Hollywood Is Officially Hunting for Pokemon Go Rights, and More Movie NewsOscar Isaac teams up with Steven Spielberg, Javier Bardem becomes a monster, Chiwetel Ejiofor gets Biblical, and Saw gets another sequel.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 15, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Frankenstein, Pokemon, Wonder Woman, and the eighth movie in the Saw franchise.This Week’s Top StoryHOLLYWOOD HUNTING FOR POKEMON GO RIGHTSThis week’s biggest story in film development news is actually a continuation of something that started in April. At that time, the idea of Legendary Entertainment getting close to acquiring the live-action Pokemon rights could have been interpreted as Legendary looking for their next video game adaptation following the (presumed) success of Warcraft.&nbsp;Warcraft had a huge opening in China, and has earned $430 million globally (enough for Warcraft to make in the top 10 for the year, thus far), but it was also a flop critically, and in the USA. However, one week sure can change things. The “augmented reality” game Pokemon Go launched just nine days ago (7/6/16), but within a week,&nbsp;the game had almost as many daily active users as Twitter (!). Nintendo’s stock price subsequently jumped up 25%, (seemingly), instantly increasing the company’s value by an additional $9 billion. So, Hollywood is very much now interested in a live action Pokemon reboot, and Legendary Pictures is looking like they were ahead of the curve, considering that their talks started three months before Pokemon Go even launched. The other two studios that had been vying for the Pokemon rights were Warner Bros and Sony Pictures, but it looks like Legendary is&nbsp;very close to sealing the deal. It’s still unclear what approach the live-action Pokemon remake might take, but loosely, there seem like two main options: Legendary could stick closely to the traditional Pokemon lore, or they could go with&nbsp;a direct adaptation of Pokemon Go, perhaps following people hunting for Pokemon in the real world. If the rumors are true, the screenwriter who might have the job of figuring it out is Max Landis (American Ultra, Victor Frankenstein), whose only Fresh Tomatometer score thus far was for Chronicle.Fresh Developments This Week1. OSCAR ISAAC JOINS SPIELBERG’S THE KIDNAPPING OF EDGARDO MONTARAMost of the attention on&nbsp;future Steven Spielberg movies this year has been on his adaptation of Ready Player One. However, the prolific&nbsp;director is rarely working on just “one movie” at any given time. Right now, another&nbsp;impending project is an adaptation of the bestselling non-fiction book The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara by David Kertzer, which&nbsp;relays the true story of a Jewish child (born in Italy) who was seized by the Catholic Church in the mid-19th century, then converted to Catholicism and went on to become a priest. The central figure on the church side of the controversy will be Pope Pius IX, who will be played by Mark Rylance, marking his fourth Spielberg film in a row (after Bridge of Spies, The BFG, and Ready Player One). It is as yet unknown what role Oscar Isaac (who is now in talks) will be playing, but&nbsp;since some sources have pointed to him as “the lead,” the obvious answer would be Edgardo Mortara himself.&nbsp;The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara is expected to start filming in early 2017 —&nbsp;Ready Player One is scheduled for release on March 30, 2018, so the earliest possible release window for TKoEM is probably late 2018, AKA “awards season.”2.&nbsp;JAVIER BARDEM TO BE RESURRECTED AS UNIVERSAL’S FRANKENSTEIN (‘S MONSTER)We’ve known for a few years now that Universal Pictures wants to build a new “cinematic universe” around reboots of their Universal Monsters. The first of these&nbsp;will be another reboot of The Mummy, set in the present day (to be released next summer, on June 9, 2017); its titular monster&nbsp;will be female this time, played by Kingsman: The Secret Service costar Sofia Boutella, and this week, the Internet was deluged by nearly 100 images of Boutella in “Mummy” costumes from filming on location. The non-Mummy star of that movie will be Tom Cruise, and recent months have brought news of other A-list stars who will costar. Russell Crowe will play a character similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Johnny Depp will star in The Invisible Man in early 2018. As noted in this article, Universal Pictures seems to be focusing on casting actors in their 50s. Javier Bardem&nbsp;(Skyfall, No Country for Old Men) isn’t quite 50 yet, but he’s close (his 50th birthday will be on March 1st, 2019), and this week we learned that he is now in talks with Universal Pictures to star in their new monster movies as Frankenstein. Specifically,&nbsp;Bardem is not up for the role&nbsp;Frankenstein himself, but rather the monster that Dr. Victor Frankenstein creates. There have been rumors that Angelina Jolie will star in a Bride of Frankenstein movie, and this news fits right in with that, because Bardem is not expected to debut in a Frankenstein movie, but one of the earlier UMCU (Universal Monsters Cinematic Universe) movies.&nbsp;The Mummy is nearly done filming, so it probably won’t be that film, but the next possibility might be The Invisible Man (TBA 2018). Russell Crowe’s Jekyll/Hyde-like character is also expected to appear in other UCMU movies before receiving his own feature.3.&nbsp;BALLET STAR MISTY COPELAND TO DANCE IN DISNEY’S THE NUTCRACKER AND THE FOUR REALMSOne of the many films that Walt Disney Pictures is adapting into live action from their classic animated filmography actually comes from one part of a film, the 1940 classic&nbsp;Fantasia. Specifically, we’re talking about The Nutcracker Suite, which was based on the ballet with music written by Pyotr Tchaikovsky. Disney’s movie will be called The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, and it will be based on both Tchaikovsky’s ballet&nbsp;as well as the 1816 fairy tale story by E.T.A. Hoffmann called&nbsp; The Nutcracker and the Mouse King,&nbsp;which the ballet was itself based upon. So, since Disney’s new Nutcracker movie is ultimately based on a ballet, this week’s news probably should have been a complete no-brainer. Ballet dancer Misty Copeland took to her Instagram account this week to post an image of the script by Ashleigh Powell (who will be making her feature film debut with The Nutcracker and the Four Realms), confirming that she will star in the adaptation. Copeland is the first cast member we have heard about, but she won’t be the last, as the various versions of The Nutcracker have a lot of characters, including the Nutcracker himself, the Mouse King (and Queen), the Sugar Plum Fairy, and of course, the large family at the center of the entire story. This magical adventure will be directed by Lasse Hallstrom, whose lengthy filmography includes What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, Chocolate, The Cider House Rules, and My Life as a Dog. There is no release date officially set for The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, but given the Christmas theme, there is a very, very strong chance that it is the Untitled Disney Fairy Tale (Live Action) currently on their schedule for November 2, 2018.4.&nbsp;ZENDAYA TO TRAPEZE SWING OVER HUGH JACKMAN IN THE GREATEST SHOWMAN ON EARTHOne of the most ambitious non-superhero movies that Hugh Jackman has been attached to star in for several years now (since 2009) is 20th Century Fox’s The Greatest Showman on Earth. As the title suggests, this film (scheduled for 12/25/17) will be a biographical musical drama about the life of 19th century circus entrepreneur P.T. Barnum, who, of course, will be played by Jackman (who’s also producing). In recent weeks, we’ve heard about the casting of both Zac Efron (as Barnum’s “right hand man”), and Michelle Williams (as Barnum’s romantic interest). This week, we learned that Fox is hoping to attract a young audience with the news that former Disney star Zendaya is now in talks to play a trapeze artist in Barnum’s circus.&nbsp;The Greatest Showman on Earth will be the feature film directorial debut of Michael Gracey (who is working on an adaptation of the manga/video game Naruto), working from a script by Michael Arndt (Toy Story 3; cowriter of Star Wars: The Force Awakens). 20th Century Fox has scheduled The Greatest Showman on Earth for December 25th, by which point the world will probably be much more familiar with Zendaya, due to her reportedly major role in Marvel’s Spider-Man: Homecoming (July 7, 2017).5.&nbsp;DISNEY DEVELOPING ANOTHER PROJECT WITH FINDING DORY STAR ELLEN DEGENERESOne can argue lots of other factors at play here, but the facts are plain: Finding Dory is Pixar’s top box office earner to date, and Finding Nemo was no slouch either, now at #4 out of 17 films. One arguable factor in both films was the voice talent of Ellen DeGeneres, without whom Dory wouldn’t really be the Dory that audiences (and critics) have come to love. Knowing a good thing when they have it, Walt Disney Pictures is striving to continue working with Ellen DeGeneres on (at least) one future project, namely an adaptation of the children’s book Castle Hangnail, by author Ursula Vernon, the creator of the Dragonbreath series. The book will be adapted by Bill Kunstler, who is best known for his work as a writer and producer on TV shows like Mom, The Crazy Ones, The War at Home, and Accidentally on Purpose.&nbsp;Castle Hangnail is about a 12-year-old girl who shows up at the title location hoping to fill a vacancy as a “wicked witch,” and to do so, she must accomplish a series of tasks. Ellen DeGeneres is producing Castle Hangnail, and is likely to star in the film, but which character she would play is unknown.6.&nbsp;CHIWETEL EJIOFOR TO PLAY ST. PETER IN MARY MAGDALENEThe story of Jesus Christ is often&nbsp;called “the greatest story ever told” for a reason, and&nbsp;Hollywood seems intent on retelling it again and again;&nbsp;this year alone, we’ve already had two movies about Him —&nbsp;Last Days in the Desert (with Ewan McGregor as Jesus) and Risen&nbsp;(with Cliff Curtis as “Yeshua”, AKA Jesus) — and they keep coming. The next project to tackle the tale will focus on His companion, Mary Magdalene. We’ve known for a while now that Rooney Mara (Carol, The Social Network) will star in the film as the title character, with Joaquin Phoenix taking on the role of Christ. This week, we learned that Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) is now in talks to play St. Peter,&nbsp;one of Christ’s 12 apostles. In many films about Jesus Christ, not all of the apostles receive the same amount of attention in the story, but St. Peter (AKA “The Rock”) is usually one of the most central figures. Director Garth Davis, whose debut film is this year’s Lion, expects to start filming Mary Magdalene this summer for the Weinstein Company, who are expecting to release Mary Magdalene sometime in 2017 (possibly around Easter).7. COLIN FARRELL TO STAR IN REMAKE OF CLINT EASTWOOD’S THE BEGUILEDToday’s release of the remake of Ghostbusters has brought into the spotlight the social debate over&nbsp;remakes, and whether some older films should or shouldn’t ever be remade, rebooted, regurgitated, etc. One thing to remember&nbsp;is that Hollywood’s been doing it since the “silent era,” and some of our most beloved movies (like say, The Wizard of Oz, The Thing, Scarface, The Magnificent Seven, and The Ten Commandments) were themselves remakes of earlier films. Some pundits make the argument that the best candidates for remakes are films that were either flawed in some way, or that technology has improved to tell certain stories more effectively, or in some cases, that&nbsp;the original is just so obscure or forgotten that most wouldn’t even recognize a&nbsp;remake of it. Option #3 feels the most relevant to this week’s news, because few moviegoers have likely&nbsp;even heard of the 1971 film The Beguiled, starring Clint Eastwood as a wounded Union soldier during the Civil War. Director Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation, Marie Antoinette) apparently has, however, because she has written and will direct a remake of The Beguiled. Colin Farrell is now in talks to star as the soldier, who takes refuge at an all-girls boarding school and&nbsp;“cons his way into several lonely women’s hearts.” Farrell is joining a mostly female cast which already includes Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, and Elle Fanning. There is no filming start date for The Beguiled yet, but if financing can be found, there’s a good chance it will be Sofia Coppola’s next film (after departing the live action non-Disney remake of The Little Mermaid).Rotten IdeaS of The Week2. THE WRITERS OF WONDER WOMAN… ARE ALL MEN?When Warner Bros and DC Comics were looking for a director for next summer’s Wonder Woman (6/2/17), it was clear they were looking for a female director. The job ultimately&nbsp;went to Monster director Patty Jenkins, after Breaking Bad producer/director Michelle MacLaren worked on it for a while, but eventually dropped out. Arguments can be made about whether gender identity plays a role in filmmaking, but WB’s efforts to cast a female director suggests they were at least attempting to match it up. That’s why it’s particularly confusing and/or confounding to learn&nbsp;that the official screenwriter credits are for “a screenplay by Allan Heinberg and Geoff Johns, story by Zack Snyder &amp; Allan Heinberg.” In other words, Wonder Woman was written entirely by men. Of course, Wonder Woman was created by a man, and a rather controversial male writer at that, about whom much as been written. That was, however, also in 1941, and one might assume that 75 years later, things might be different. This would also be a good time to note that we are aware of the super relevant (but probably coincidental) timing of this story, which we’re reporting to you on the day that the reboot of Ghostbusters is being released (and all of the gender politics that come with it, from both sides). We’ll just point you to some other articles about this issue, published by&nbsp;The Verge, The Mary Sue, and Romper. What do you think? Should the first ever live action movie about the original female super hero icon have been written by at least one woman?1.&nbsp;SOME “ROTTEN” FRANCHISES JUST DON’T KNOW WHEN TO DIE:&nbsp;SAW #8 COMING IN 2017People like familiar franchises that provide sequels with familiar expectations; we get that. But some franchises fail&nbsp;to transcend their very niche audiences and be embraced, at least on some level.&nbsp;One such franchise is the “torture porn” extravaganza known as the Saw franchise, which critically peaked at 48 percent with the first movie (still Rotten) and whose most recent installment, Saw: The Final Chapter, failed to reach double digits on the Tomatometer. That said, even if it did seem like the Saw franchise was pretty much over, another factor in play was that Lionsgate needed lots and lots of franchises and ongoing ventures&nbsp;after&nbsp;The Hunger Games (and other YA adaptations) came to an end. With all that in mind, Lionsgate is preparing to produce an 8th Saw movie, which they have scheduled for release next year&nbsp;on October 27, 2017 (just before Halloween, of course), and they’ve&nbsp;hired the creative writer/director team of the Spierig Brothers (Peter and Michael) to do it. The Spierig Brothers bring a certain level of fan anticipation to the Saw franchise, as their two most recent films (Daybreakers and Predestination) both received Fresh Tomatometer scores.&nbsp; So, it’s sort of a tricky thing. On one hand, we have directors who have given us two pretty great genre films recently; on the other, it’s still the Saw franchise we’re talking about here. Verdict: This is the Rotten Idea of the Week.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Extras, Shondaland","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/15171436/Pokemon-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"hollywood-is-officially-hunting-for-pokemon-go-rights-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509193445797","title":"Detective Pikachu, Marvel/DC Cast Updates, Trailers Galore, and More Headlines From Comic-Con","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Detective Pikachu, Marvel/DC Cast Updates, Trailers Galore, and More Headlines From Comic-ConBlair Witch pulls a bait-and-switch, Star-Lord's dad is revealed, Sia becomes a pony, and Pepe Le Pew gets a movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 25, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, the Weekly Ketchup departed from our regular Friday schedule, because of San Diego Comic-Con and all of the extra big news that it brought forth throughout the weekend. First, we ran a special pre-SDCC&nbsp;Weekly Ketchup on Wednesday, and today, you get a bonus post-SDCC Weekly Ketchup! This edition brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Blair Witch, Captain Marvel, Detective Pikachu, My Little Pony: The Movie, and Pepe Le Pew.SDCC 2016’s Top StoryPOKEMON GO CRAZE GETS DETECTIVE PIKACHU&nbsp;GREENLITDC and Marvel both had big panels this year (after Marvel took last year off), but neither made any big announcements about new movies (that we didn’t already know about). The biggest news actually came on Wednesday afternoon, just before the doors opened to the San Diego Comic-Con preview night, from Legendary Entertainment, the company behind Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, Watchmen, Godzilla, and Warcraft.&nbsp;The latter’s disappointing U.S. box office may have derailed its franchise potential, so Legendary was on the “hunt” for another videogame franchise, and they appear to have found it just as Pokemon Go is gripping the world in a “gotta catch ’em all” frenzy. Legendary Entertainment has announced that they are partnering with The Pokémon Company to produce the first-ever live action Pokemon movie, an adaptation of the character Detective Pikachu. Rather than centering on&nbsp;Ash, Team Rocket, or other Pokemon hunters, this movie will adapt the 2016 Nintendo 3DS game about a Pikachu who puts on a Sherlock Holmes-style Deerstalker hat, holds a magnifying glass, and solves mysteries like a little yellow Encyclopedia Brown. Although they’re calling this movie “live action,” Detective Pikachu will almost certainly be a CGI character. Legendary is putting Detective Pikachu on the fast track, aiming to start filming in 2017, but as yet, they haven’t announced a director, cast, or even a screenwriter. Speaking of which, at SDCC this week, screenwriter Max Landis (Chronicle, American Ultra) revealed to Collider that he had made a “cute, sweet” Pokemon pitch about a family of hunters, and a Koffing that they find in the woods. As for Detective Pikachu, it’s possible we could see it in theaters as soon as 2018, but there’s no confirmed release date yet.Fresh Developments From the Con1. GUERRILA FILM MARKETING 101: THE WOODS IS ACTUALLY THE NEW BLAIR WITCHBack in February, 2015, it was announced that director Adam Wingard (You’re Next, The Guest) had signed with Lionsgate to direct a movie called The Woods. The past 17 months since then went pretty much as expected, with Lionsgate scheduling the movie for September 16, 2016. The first trailer was&nbsp;to be revealed at San Diego Comic-Con around the time that the movie would be screened for Adam Wingard enthusiasts on Friday night, and that did indeed happen, except that fans discovered the movie wasn’t called The Woods at all. Nope, the movie that Adam Wingard made turned out to be&nbsp;Blair Witch, the third movie in the franchise started in 1999 by The Blair Witch Project. We’re calling this the #1 “Fresh Development” of the week because the film already has a Tomatometer score, and it’s 100 percent Fresh (based, admittedly, on 7 reviews). The craziest thing is, a&nbsp;clue was out there all along for anyone who wanted to look for it: the poster for The Woods, which has been around for months, says, “There’s something evil hiding,” and in the trees above that, you can trace out the five points of the “Blair Witch” symbol.2. SETH ROGEN PROMISES YOU’LL BE INVITED TO SAUSAGE PARTY 2There are so many different events going on at San Diego Comic-Con (with most press all attending the same panels) that invariably a few interesting stories go relatively unreported. One example&nbsp;was&nbsp;the screening for the new R-rated comedy Sausage Party (8/12/16), where star/producer/cowriter Seth Rogen said the following:&nbsp;“This was the first time we ended a movie with the intention of making another one. We want to make sausage-talking movies for the rest of our lives.” Although it’s probably obvious that lots of stars and filmmakers would love to make sequels to their films, this was the first time we’ve heard much about the possibility of a Sausage Party 2. Of course, there are a lot of factors at play, but we at least know that Seth Rogen is indeed interested in making it potentially his next sequel project after this year’s Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising. We’re calling this one of the top Fresh Developments of this Ketchup because Sausage Party already has a Fresh Tomatometer score of 100 percent.3.&nbsp;JUSTICE LEAGUE AND OTHER HOT NEW TRAILERS OUT OF SAN DIEGO COMIC-CONMovie trailers are, generally, not so much part of the “film development” cycle as they are part of “film marketing.” However, if this is a special Weekly Ketchup devoted to the news that came out of San Diego Comic-Con, the column couldn’t very well ignore the new trailers. There are several to cover, so let’s just get started. Stacked up against each other, based on what was actually shown at SDCC, DC and Marvel might have come out even, but judging just based on what you can actually watch right now, DC Comics might have the win. That’s because they revealed nearly three minutes of Justice League (11/17/17), focusing on the sequences where Batman (Ben Affleck) tries to recruit both Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and The Flash (Ezra Miller).&nbsp;Wonder Woman is seen less in that package (though more than Cyborg), but that might be because Warner Bros also dropped the second trailer for next summer’s Wonder Woman (6/2/17). Warner Bros also released the latest trailer for The LEGO Batman Movie (2/10/17) at SDCC this weekend. On the other side of the comics world, Marvel did show a Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 package at SDCC, but it’s not online yet. So, instead, the only new Marvel movie trailer is the second one for this fall’s Doctor Strange (11/4/16), but they also showcased teasers for their upcoming Netflix series Luke Cage, Iron Fist,&nbsp;and The Defenders. As for non-superhero movies, this weekend also gave us our first trailers for Guy Ritchie’s&nbsp;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (3/24/17), xXx: The Return of Xander Cage (1/20/17), the Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and Kong: Skull Island (3/10/17), among many others.4. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 IDENTITIES REVEALEDIf you’re trying to stay completely unspoiled about Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (5/5/17) — or Thor: Ragnarok, for that matter — you might to avoid reading the rest of this story. The obvious “biggest” mystery left unresolved in Guardians of the Galaxy was the identity of Star-Lord’s (Chris Pratt) father, and in the last two years, director James Gunn has tiptoed around revealing any hard details. This has also led to a lot of fun speculation, including such potential Star-Daddies as Thanos, Yondu, The Collector, Adam Warlock, Starfox, and Starhawk. As this was the last SDCC before the movie comes out next May, it was the right time for a few big reveals. Probably the biggest of them was confirmation that the character Kurt Russell was brought on board to play is Star-Lord’s dad — and also, Ego the Living Planet. The Lee/Kirby years gave us a lot of crazy Marvel characters, but one of the craziest was Ego, who, like his subtitle suggests, was literally a huge living planet, complete with a gigantic purple talking face. Having said that, the movie version of Ego won’t be exactly the same, since Ego obviously took some sort of human form and met Star-Lord’s mother. Director James Gunn made a rather lengthy Facebook post about Ego, including lots of other details to explain some of this. Marvel also offered more information on another “cosmic” movie this weekend, namely Thor: Ragnarok (11/3/17), which the studio all but confirmed&nbsp;will touch upon the Planet Hulk storyline. How do we know that? &nbsp;Because the studio&nbsp;showed off the “gladiator” armor that Hulk wore during that story, and it’s directly from the set of Thor: Ragnarok. So, yes, someday you’re going to see Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk in a red mohawk helmet, wielding a huge battle axe. This is the crazy movie world we live in now.&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok is being directed by Taika Waititi (codirector of What We Do in the Shadows).5. BRIE LARSON TO BLAST INTO THEATERS AS CAPTAIN MARVEL IN 2019Nearly two months ago, the top story in the Weekly Ketchup was the news that Brie Larson was in talks with Marvel Studios to be their Captain Marvel (Marvel’s Carol Danvers, not DC’s Shazam). Even so, anticipating their big event&nbsp;at SDCC this past weekend, Marvel&nbsp;took the opportunity to officially confirm what many fans thought they already knew. (And frankly, the SDCC bump probably made this bigger news for most people who hadn’t heard about it in early June). Nothing else new was really announced, such as who will be directing Captain Marvel, though it’s possible that the studio might have thought they would be ready to make the announcement as they were preparing for SDCC. What we do know is that Marvel has scheduled Captain Marvel for release on March 8, 2019. However, it’s possible/likely that Brie Larson will make her debut as Captain Marvel in an earlier film, with Avengers: Infinity War Part I (5/4/18) being the most likely candidate.6. MICHONNE FROM THE WALKING DEAD JOINS MARVEL’S BLACK PANTHERMarvel Studios still has one more movie this year (Doctor Strange, 11/4/16), and then three next year: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (5/5/17), Spider-Man: Homecoming (7/7/17), and Thor: Ragnarok (11/3/17). Those first two recently wrapped filming, and the the other two are currently filming, but Marvel is a non-stop movie magic machine, so that means there’s a fifth film they’re currently preparing. That honor this weekend went to Black Panther (2/16/18), which was able to make a big cast announcement at SDCC, plus offer details about two of the actors who had already been cast. The newest Black Panther cast member is Danai Gurira, who most people know as Michonne from TV’s The Walking Dead. Gurira will be playing Okoye, the leader of the Dora Milaje, who in the fictional kingdom of Wakanda serve as both T’Challa’s personal bodyguards and potential future queens. Gurira joins Lupita Nyong’o as Nakia, described as T’Challa’s romantic interest (though her story might be a bit more complicated than that). Also, we now know that Michael B. Jordan will be playing Erik Killmonger, who will be the film’s main villain (though not necessarily the only one, as Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, will probably be in the movie as well). T’Challa, AKA Black Panther himself, will of course be played by Chadwick Boseman, who made the news this week for another, completely unrelated movie, when he sold a pitch to Paramount Pictures based on the life of Reverend Jeffrey Brown, who worked to fight gang violence in Boston. Boseman, who is producing and cowriting the film, will play Reverend Brown.7.&nbsp;SUICIDE SQUAD STAR MARGOT ROBBIE MAKES NEW DEAL FOR SOME BAD MONKEYSOne of the oldest “movie deal” schemes in the books is the idea of making your stars their next big deal just before their next movie comes out (just in case the presumed hit isn’t so much a hit). Having said that, Suicide Squad (8/5/16) is probably as close to a sure thing this year as most filmmakers are likely to get, with some pundits predicting a new August box office record in the $125 million range (!). Margot Robbie, who caught her big break in Martin Scorsese’s The&nbsp;Wolf of Wall Street, headlined&nbsp;this month’s The Legend of Tarzan, and co-stars in Suicide Squad as Joker’s sassy gal pal Harley Quinn, is arguably already a big deal, but that didn’t stop her from announcing a new project two weeks ahead of Suicide Squad‘s release. Robbie has made a deal with Universal Pictures to produce and star in an adaptation of the 2007 Matt Ruff novel Bad Monkeys. Much like her Harley Quinn character (who is also expected to get a solo spinoff movie from Warner Bros), Robbie will be playing a woman held in a prison’s psychiatric wing, where she is regularly questioned about the murder she was arrested for, despite&nbsp;her claims that she belongs to a secret organization called the “Department for the Final Disposition of Irredeemable Persons” (aka the “Bad Monkeys”).8.&nbsp;POP STAR SIA JOINS THE VOICE CAST OF MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIEPop singer Sia, who’s famous for always wearing masks or wigs that obscure her face, has landed another new gig where people won’t see her face. Sia signed with Lionsgate and Hasbro to provide the voice of a pony pop star named Songbird Serenade in next year’s My Little Pony: The Movie (10/6/17). Sia will also provide the movie with two new original songs. And like Sia herself, the face of Songbird Serenade&nbsp;will be obscured by long pony bangs. Sia is the latest to join a voice cast that also includes Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Taye Diggs, Michael Pena, and Liev Schreiber.Most Rotten Idea from the Con1. SERIAL “BAD ROLE MODEL” PEPE LE PEW STILL GETTING HIS OWN MOVIEThere are just some pop culture icons from decades ago that have not aged well at all. Take&nbsp;the Looney Tunes character Pepe Le Pew, for example: his entire raison d’etre (to use some actual French) was to chase female cats around, attempting to, at best, sexually harass them, and at worst, well, let’s not go there. In the 1940s and 1950s, that sort of behavior might have seemed cute to (then) contemporary audiences, but today, it’s straight up creepy. Even so, someone at Warner Bros apparently thinks a new Pepe Le Pew movie is still a great idea, so, here we are with this week’s Rotten Idea. Screenwriter Max Landis revealed that he is currently working on said film&nbsp;at the same SDCC where he revealed that he had once pitched an idea for a Pokemon movie (which wasn’t picked up, as we also mentioned up above). Warner Bros is also actively developing a movie based on Speedy Gonzales.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"cancelled, blockbusters","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/25134605/Detective-Pikachu-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"detective-pikachu-marveldc-cast-updates-trailers-galore-and-more-headlines-from-comic-con"},{"id":"47509191896479","title":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child May Become a Trilogy, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Harry Potter and the Cursed Child May Become a Trilogy, and More Movie NewsDirectors Richard Linklater and Derek Cianfrance get new gigs, Ben Affleck teases Deathstroke, and Anne Hathaway, James Franco, and Sebastian Stan get new roles.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 2, 2016 |  CommentsAs Hollywood collectively prepared for (or got an early start on) their long Labor Day holidays, film development news seemed to slow down to almost a halt, but there were still some stories (possibly to take advantage of the news drought). This week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Spider-Man: Homecoming and the Jumanji sequel, and new roles for Bryan Cranston and Anne Hathaway.This WEEK’S TOP STORYHARRY POTTER AND THE UNCONFIRMED TRILOGY RUMORWithin seconds of when the news first broke that J.K. Rowling had approved a two-part play called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (based on her own story idea), there were probably already thousands of people wondering if it would be a movie someday. This week, there was a story in the New York Daily News claiming that sources within Warner Bros (the studio behind all of the Harry Potter movies) is hoping to secure precisely those rights. If the story is true, the plan would be to adapt the five hours of the two parts of the play into a new trilogy, possibly starting as early as 2020. (We should point out since Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3 is already scheduled for release on November 20, 2020, it seems unlikely WB would schedule both films in the same calendar year.) Five hours split three ways is 100 minutes each, but one could also guess that the movies would have special effects-filled sequences that would probably add about twenty minutes to each film. Anyway, also in the “well, yeah, duh” category, the story claims that Warner Bros is hoping that Daniel Radcliffe would agree to reprise the role in what would be his 9th, 10th, and 11th movies as Harry Potter. Radcliffe will turn 31 on July 23, 2020.UPDATE: RT has received a notice from Warner Bros. stating that there are currently no confirmed plans to adapt the stage play into a film (or multiple films, for that matter).Fresh Developments1. RICHARD LINKLATER TO DIRECT SEQUEL LAST FLAG FLYINGDirector Richard Linklater is no stranger to sequels (having made a trilogy that started with Before Sunrise in 1995), but those films were also his own sequels. Now we know that Linklater is preparing to direct an adaptation of the novel Last Flag Flying, which author Daryl Ponicsan wrote as a sequel to his 1970 novel The Last Detail, which was itself adapted into the Oscar-nominated 1973 film of the same name starring Jack Nicholson, Otis Young, and Randy Quaid. In the original film, Nicholson and Young played two Navy sailors assigned to escor another sailor (played by Quaid) to prison; on the way, misadventures are had. Richard Linklater has already cast the three leads in Last Flag Flying, but we only know for sure one of the characters that the actors will be playing (for a rather obvious reason). Laurence Fishburne will play the African American sailor played by Otis Young, and the other two characters will be played by Bryan Cranston and Steve Carell. We’re going with the guess that Cranston is playing Nicholson’s role, and Carell is playing Quaid’s, but that’s really only based on the age difference of six years between Cranston and Carell. In Last Flag Flying, the character that Quaid played asks the other two sailors for their help in getting the body of his son returned to the USA after he is killed while fighting in Iraq. Amazon Studios is currently the frontrunner for distributing Last Flag Flying, but that does not necessarily discount the possibility of a theatrical release.2. THE LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS DIRECTOR TO TAKE ON COMANCHE CHIEF BIOPICToday is the release date of The Light Between Oceans, the third feature film directed by Derek Cianfrance, after Blue Valentine and The Place Beyond the Pines (all three of which received Fresh Tomatometer scores). Cianfrance (and his agents) are not wasting any time in lining up his potential next film, as the director has made a deal with Warner Bros for an untitled historical biopic — which Derek Cianfrance also cowrote — based upon the S.C. Gwynne nonfiction book Empire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History (which obviously wouldn’t fit on a marquee). As the title suggests, the book tells (and the movie will tell) the true story of Quanah Parker, the last chief of the Comanche tribe, who led one of the last large Native American raids against European Americans. Cianfrance is expected to be casting largely from the Comanche nation, but there are also two major roles for European American actors (Quanah Parker’s mother, and the cavalry officer who helped him settle the Comanche on a reservation).3. WINTER SOLDIER SEBASTIAN STAN JOINS STAR-STUDDED LOGAN LUCKYDirector Steven Soderbergh‘s &nbsp;next theatrically-released film after Magic Mike in 2012 &nbsp;will be Logan Lucky, about two brothers who attempt to pull off a heist during a major NASCAR race in North Carolina. The film is already in production, and the cast list is so long that most people would have been justified in thinking that Soderbergh was done adding&nbsp;major names. The cast currently includes (and this isn’t even everybody): Daniel Craig, Adam Driver, Katherine Heigl, Seth MacFarlane, DJ Qualls, Hilary Swank, Channing Tatum, and Katherine Waterston. This week’s late arrival to Logan Lucky is Sebastian Stan (AKA Marvel’s “Winter Soldier”), who will be playing a three-time NASCAR champion who is returning to the sport after time “away” (though why he was “away” is not yet known).4. BEN AFFLECK POSTS VIDEO OF DC’S DEATHSTROKE THE TERMINATOR; FANS FREAK OUTBen Affleck is currently filming his third&nbsp;film as Batman, next year’s Justice League (11/17/17). &nbsp;This week, the actor and director also posted a video of an actor (or stuntman) dressed in what appeared to be the costume of the DC Comics anti-hero Deathstroke the Terminator (sometimes just called “Deathstroke” to avoid confusion with the movie character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger). It’s not yet known (for sure) if that means that Deathstroke will be appearing in Justice League, but it has been confirmed that Deathstroke will be the “main antagonist” in the solo Batman movie which Ben Affleck will be starring in and directing. If Deathstroke does not appear in Justice League, it might just be that Affleck and Warner Bros are getting an early start on testing out the costume.5. JON FAVREAU TO REPRISE HIS IRON MAN CHARACTER IN SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING&nbsp;We’ve known for several months now that Robert Downey Jr. will be appearing as Tony Stark in next summer’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, continuing the relationship between Stark and Tom Holland’s Peter Parker that began in this year’s Captain America: Civil War. There’s still no indication that, say, Gwyneth Paltrow might also be in Spider-Man: Homecoming, but this week, we learned that Jon Favreau will be returning as Stark’s friend and chauffeur, Happy Hogan. &nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming is scheduled for release on July 7, 2017.6. ANNE HATHAWAY SUGGESTS WE SHOULD LIVE FAST DIE HOT(Though for some of us, it’s either too late, or was never really an option.) Like many major movie stars, Anne Hathaway is moving towards producing more of the films she stars in, after making her producer debut with 2014’s Song One. Hathaway’s latest venture as both a star and a producer will be set up at Warner Bros., and the film will be called Live Fast Die Hot, an adaptation of a collection of essays of the same title by actress Jenny Mollen. Jenny Mollen is also married to American Pie star Jason Biggs, but it’s not yet known if Biggs will reprise his role as, well, himself, after starring in the real-life rehearsals that inspired Mollen’s book. It’s also possible the film will fictionalize Mollen’s husband, or just cast a completely different actor who’s sort of Jason Biggs-ish.7. JAMES FRANCO AND ZOE KRAVITZ TO STAR IN SCI-FI MOVIE KINIt’s becoming more and more common that feature films are being adapted from short films, often by the same filmmakers; recent examples include the horror films Mama and Light’s Out. The latest such short film to be expanded beyond its original 14 minute running time is Bag Man ( which you can watch on YouTube here). For the feature film version, the title is being changed to Kin, and the stars will include James Franco, Jack Reynor, Zoe Kravitz, and Dennis Quaid. The film is described as “science fiction” and depicts an ex-con (Reynor) who is forced to go on the run with his brother as they are being chased by an evil “vengeful” criminal.8. GOTG STAR KAREN GILLAN JOINS THE JUMANJI SEQUEL/REBOOTFans of the more recent revival of TV’s Doctor Who probably know Karen Gillan from that show, but for movie fans, Gillan might be best known for playing Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy (and in next year’s sequel). This week, Gillan joined yet another franchise, though the jury is still out on whether Jumanji will have the fan cachet of the other two. &nbsp;Karen Gillan is described as playing the “female lead,” but the same article also mentions that there are five main leads, which suggests that the new Jumanji has four male leads and, well, Karen Gillan. We already know that Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart are continuing their on screen partnership after Central Intelligence, and Jack Black is also one of the stars, which leaves one other male star (possibly Nick Jonas). Johnson also revealed concept art for his Jumanji&nbsp;character this week, and it’s rather&nbsp;notably similar to Indiana Jones. The Jumanji sequel doesn’t have a title yet, but Columbia Pictures has given it a release date of July 28, 2017 (up against one of Disney’s “live action remakes”, though we don’t know yet which one that might be).ROTTEN IDEA&nbsp;OF THE WEEK1. KING ARTHUR ACTOR TO PLAY KING ARTHUR IN TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHTEvery once in a while in casting, someone involved will say, “we should get someone like [fill in the blanks],” and then they end up just going ahead and casting the person they were talking about. For Transformers: The Last Knight, (6/23/17) which apparently is partly set during the rein of the “real” King Arthur, something similar sounds like it might have happened. That’s because the role of King Arthur in this fifth Transformers movie will be played&nbsp;by Liam Garrigan, who also plays King Arthur on the ABC TV series Once Upon a Time. We’re calling this the Rotten Idea of the Week because all four of the previous Transformers movies have received Rotten Tomatometer scores (and progressively so).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Mirror, Emmy, star, All, politics, curtis, Superheroes, Adventures","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/02182954/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-may-become-a-trilogy-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509191913890","title":"Rihanna and Anne Hathaway May Join Ocean’s Eight, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rihanna and Anne Hathaway May Join Ocean's Eight, and More Movie NewsThe Chronicles of Narnia will continue, Brie Larson takes on a pet project, Man of Steel will get a direct sequel, and bad news for Ghostbusters and M.I.B. 23.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 12, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Curious George, Han Solo: A Star Wars Story, Ocean’s Eight, and World War Z 2.This WEEK’S TOP STORYRIHANNA AND ANNE HATHAWAY ARE #6 AND #7 IN OCEAN’S EIGHTThis may not have been a great week for another gender-switching movie (see the Ghostbusters news down below), but the female-centric sequel/reboot of Ocean’s Eleven seems to be moving along quite smoothly. We’ve known for several months that Sandra Bullock (a good friend of George Clooney’s) has been attached to star as the leader of a group of female thieves (basically the “Danny Ocean” role). Three other actresses who were announced and later confirmed were Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham-Carter, and Mindy Kaling. This week, three more names were added to the list, with just one yet to be confirmed. Anne Hathaway, singer Rihanna, and rapper-turned-actress Nora Lum (AKA “Awkwafina“) are now in negotiations with Warner Bros to be the #5, #6, and #7 actresses in the sequel Ocean’s Eight. As for #8, the actress who’s long been associated with Ocean’s Eight (but hasn’t been confirmed yet) is Elizabeth Banks, so there’s a good chance it’s either her or — if she drops out — someone else that’s “sort of similar” to her.&nbsp;Ocean’s Eight (which was previously called Ocean’s Ocho) will be directed by Gary Ross (The Hunger Games, Seabiscuit), with filming scheduled to start in October in New York City. It’s not yet known if George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, or other Ocean’s Eleven costars might reprise their roles in the film.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;BRAD PITT WANTS DAVID FINCHER FOR WORLD WAR Z 2If you follow film development news regularly, you’re probably used to this old familiar ditty: a troubled production gets dragged through the Internet wringer for months, and then it’s released, ravaged by critics, and ignored by audiences (Fantastic Four, for example). Every once in a (long) while, however, a movie comes along that actually succeeds on&nbsp;both fronts. One example&nbsp;was the 2013 “zombie apocalypse” thriller World War Z. Paramount quickly started development on a sequel, but quite similar to the struggles of the first film, things have not gone that smoothly. Paramount had penciled in a release date of June 9, 2017 (up against Tom Cruise’s reboot of The Mummy), but recently, director J.A. Bayona (The Impossible, The Orphanage) dropped out as director. In addition to starring in the World War Z movies, Brad Pitt also produces them, and it turns out that the director he now hopes to recruit for the sequel is David Fincher. Fincher is beloved by movie fans for his work on films like&nbsp;Zodiac, Gone Girl, and The Social Network, but perhaps most importantly here, he’s previously worked with Brad Pitt on three movies: Seven, Fight Club, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. David Fincher is also actively looking for his next project, after years spent trying to get a remake of Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea produced have basically led to nought (Bryan Singer is directing an adaptation of his own soon). If David Fincher does sign on for World War Z 2, Paramount will probably have to reschedule it for 2018, as filming is now expected to start (at the soonest) in possibly early 2017.2.&nbsp;STAR WARS RUMOR OF THE WEEK: DONALD GLOVER AS… LANDO CALRISSIAN?Disney and Lucasfilm spent much of this week during the Olympics getting people all excited about the new trailer for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, but online, there was a potentially bigger story bubbling up through the usual rumor factories. It started with the (verified) news that one of the characters that will be rebooted in Han Solo: A Star Wars Story (5/25/18) is Lando Calrissian, Han’s “old buddy” who owned the Millennium Falcon before him (as played by Billy Dee Williams in the original trilogy). It didn’t take long, however, until we heard the first name floated online as&nbsp;the top choice for&nbsp;the new Lando, who will join the new Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich from Hail, Caesar!). According to Devin Faraci of Birth.Movies.Death, the top contender is Donald Glover, formerly of the NBC sitcom Community. Glover recently made the news for his mystery role in Spider-Man: Homecoming (which might be Hobie Brown, AKA The Prowler), so his star is definitely ascending. But as this piece lists, there are certainly lots of young actors who could also be in the running for the highly sought-after role. There was also an online hint this week that the prequel will have a female lead (ala Rogue One), and that all four of the (as yet unrevealed) actresses up for the role are “non-white.” Whoever ends up playing Lando Calrissian, they will be working with codirectors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the guys who brought you The LEGO Movie and 21 Jump Street.3. CURIOUS GEORGE (AND THE MAN IN THE YELLOW HAT) TO GET A LIVE-ACTION REBOOTIn the early 2000s, Universal Pictures started incorporating the character of Curious George into their branding and theme parks, all in anticipation of the character’s big screen debut in 2006. Even though the animated movie featured the voice of Will Ferrell as the Man in the Yellow Hat, Curious George was a definitive box office bomb, making just $69 million globally on a budget of $50 million. Universal Pictures has not, however, given up on their goal of turning Curious George into a big screen film franchise. The new Curious George will not be animated, but rather a live action adaptation of the character created by Margaret and H.A. Rey. To that end, Universal is working with Ron Howard’s Imagine Entertainment and director Andrew Adamson, who has come on board to direct Curious George. Adamson’s last two movies as director (Mr. Pip and Cirque Du Soleil: Worlds Away) were critical disappointments, but he did direct the first two movies of both the Shrek and Chronicles of Narnia franchises, all four movies of which received Fresh Tomatometer scores. There was also news this week about a Curious George documentary to be called Monkey Business.4. CHRONICLES OF NARNIA TO BE REBOOTED FOR FOURTH MOVIE THE SILVER CHAIRThere is very little chance that author C.S. Lewis did this on purpose, but when he wrote his Chronicles of Narnia as adventures set in a world where time progresses at a different rate than ours, he solved an inevitable movie problem. Movies about children are challenged by the reality of how quickly kids grow up; the Harry Potter&nbsp;films were a very rare example of a franchise whose&nbsp;movies were able to get&nbsp;made quickly enough to not be outpaced by the impending growth of its young stars. One franchise adversely&nbsp;impacted by the realities of aging is&nbsp;The Chronicles of Narnia, the first movie of which was made back in 2005, which means that the “kids” who starred in it&nbsp;are now adults (the youngest, Georgie Henley, is 21). Add in the fact that there are seven books in the Narnia series (and only three of them have thus far been adapted), and again, it’s a good thing C.S. Lewis came up with that wacky time concept. After its previous homes at Disney (the first two) and Fox (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader), the&nbsp;Narnia&nbsp;franchise has now been picked up by Sony and its subsidiary TriStar Pictures, who&nbsp;is developing an adaptation of the fourth book (in publication order, though not chronologically), The Silver Chair. In that book, the focus shifts away from the Pevensie children to Eustace Scrubb, who was previously played by Will Poulter but will likely be recast, since Poulter himself is now 23 years old.5.&nbsp;FUTURE CAPTAIN MARVEL STAR BRIE LARSON TO DIRECT HERSELF IN INDIE UNICORN STORELike many actors and actresses who sign on for big roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Brie Larson will be very, very busy the next several years playing Carol Danvers, AKA Captain Marvel, in both her solo film and other MCU movies (possibly starting with Avengers: Infinity War in 2018). With that in mind, one challenge for someone like Larson is finding the time for outside opportunities. Apparently, Brie Larson wants to direct, and she’s not wasting any of her post-Room clout before getting to work on&nbsp;those aforementioned Marvel movies. Larson will produce and star in her directorial debut, an independent comedy called Unicorn Store, in which she’ll play a woman who, after recently moving back in with her parents, “receives an invitation to a store that will test her ideas of what it really means to grow up.” Brie Larson comes to Unicorn Store after the movie first made the news in 2012, when it was first reported as a potential vehicle for Pitch Perfect star Rebel Wilson. As for the eventual Captain Marvel movie (March 8, 2019), we learned this week that Carol Danvers’ origin story is being changed for the movie to prevent obvious comparisons with Green Lantern, as in the comics, both Carol Danvers and Hal Jordan are Air Force pilots who have encounters with aliens that give them superpowers. (Captain Marvel may still get her powers from the alien race The Kree, but it might not go down like it does in the comics.)6. NEVER MIND THE CLOWNS, MARGOT ROBBIE TO PLAY TRAPEZE STAR IN QUEEN OF THE AIRWe’ve known for a while now (long before the Rotten Tomatometer score showed up) that Warner Bros was developing a Suicide Squad spinoff for Harley Quinn and the young actress who plays her, Margot Robbie. WB is looking for other ways to keep Robbie “in house” (for example, she also recently starred in the studio’s The Legend of Tarzan), and this week, it was confirmed that the two&nbsp;have reached an agreement for the Australian actress to star in a biopic called Queen of the Air (based on a 2013 nonfiction book of the same title). Robbie will play&nbsp;Eastern European circus star Lillian Leitzel, a famous early 20th century trapeze artist for both the Ringling Brothers and the Barnum and Bailey Circuses, who became involved in a tragic romance with another circus acrobat. There is no director yet for Queen of the Air, so it’s probably a few years away from being released.ROTTEN IDEAS&nbsp;OF THE WEEK3.&nbsp;SUPERMAN AND MAN OF STEEL TO GET THIRD MOVIE.&nbsp; YAY?Somewhere on the way through development, the sequel to the Superman movie Man of Steel stopped being called Man of Steel 2, and instead became Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (to shift the focus to&nbsp;Batman and the impending Justice League franchise). The problem with that, however, is that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, regardless of what you call it, still basically was a sequel to Man of Steel. This week, we learned that Warner Bros is now developing a direct sequel to Man of Steel. We don’t know exactly when this movie will be made, so it’s difficult to say if it will be the fourth or fifth movie to feature Henry Cavill as Superman, but yes, Cavill is expected to return&nbsp;as Kal-El. That, however, is pretty much all we know about this week’s news, and it’s really missing the most important factor right now, which is the director (though various sites are already coming up with lots of interesting “dream team” possibilities). We’re calling this one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas” because, as you might have heard, this current generation of DC Comics movies don’t have the greatest Tomatometer scores ( like this one, this one, and oh yeah, this one).2.&nbsp;JASON MOMOA TO STAR IN REBOOT OF THE CROWThe idea of a reboot of the comic book superhero franchise The Crow has been kicking around for several years, including periods during which the possible new star might have been Jack Huston (Boardwalk Empire), Luke Evans (Dracula Untold), and even possibly Mark Wahlberg or Bradley Cooper. It’s been a while now since the last update, and the production company Relativity recently went through bankruptcy, so it was starting to seem like the idea&nbsp;had been set aside. Not so quick! This week, yet another actor became attached to restarting The Crow, and this time, it was someone&nbsp;who already has a much anticipated superhero movie on the way. Future Aquaman star Jason Momoa is now in talks to wear “goth” makeup and sport Hot Topic fashion as the moody rock musician-turned-undead superhero The Crow. In other Jason Momoa news, we also learned this week that the main villain in the solo Aquaman movie will be the one&nbsp;many fans expected: Black Manta. What we don’t know yet is whether he will rock that&nbsp;crazy head gear.1.&nbsp;BAD NEWS FOR FANS OF GHOSTBUSTERS AND THAT MEN IN BLACK/JUMP STREET CROSSOVER…This week, we heard two different stories that both involve the same studio (Sony Pictures) and their attempts at reviving some of their older franchises. First up, there’s the recent reboot of Ghostbusters, which, as it turns out, is going to end up being a “wash” for Sony, at a loss of anywhere from $50 million&nbsp;to $70 million. As such, industry experts are now being quoted as saying that Sony’s previously reported plans for a live action Ghostbusters sequel featuring the same cast are now “unlikely.” That doesn’t, however, mean that Sony is giving up on future Ghostbusters movies just yet, as they are still developing an animated Ghostbusters movie. It’s unknown which characters might be featured in that animated version. The other Sony project to get bad news this week was from Jonah Hill (currently promoting War Dogs), who was quoted talking about the Men in Black/21 Jump Street crossover popularly called MiB 23. Again, the word “unlikely” came up, as Hill said, “I had the idea, but I doubt that movie will ever get made. They’re trying to make all the deals, but it’s kind of impossible with all the Men in Black stuff. The Jump Street films were so fun to make, and the whole joke of them was they were making fun of remakes and sequels and reboots, and then now it’s become a giant sequel/reboot. It’s almost become what we were making fun of, and it’s hard to maintain that joke when it’s so high stakes.”","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Lucasfilm, target, Lionsgate, spider-man, live, Family, TV, History, comedies, song, kids, Arrowverse","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/16143634/Rihanna-Hathaway-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"rihanna-and-anne-hathaway-may-join-oceans-eight-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509193470385","title":"Alden Ehrenreich is Officially Young Han Solo, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Alden Ehrenreich is Officially Young Han Solo, and More Movie NewsThe Mummy gains Russell Crowe, The Flash loses its director, and Daisy Ridley does Shakespeare, among other things.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 6, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as The Flash, The Mummy, Slender Man, and X-Men: The New Mutants.This Week’s Top StoryHARRISON FORD’S HAN SOLO SHOT FIRST, ALDEN EHRENREICH SHOOTS NEXTAfter a months long casting process that started with Disney and Lucasfilm considering (reportedly) over 2,000 young actors, we finally know who will be the second live action Han Solo. Triumphing over finalists like Taron Egerton and Jack Reynor, Alden Ehrenreich has landed the potentially career-making role in Han Solo: A Star Wars Story (tentative title). Some of the story angles that the prequel might depict (we think) could include how Han Solo first met Chewbacca, won the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian, and first made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. Or maybe it’ll be about something we’ve never even heard about (who knows!). The Han Solo prequel will be the next film directed by the team of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, following their recent successes with 21 Jump Street, The LEGO Movie, and 22 Jump Street. Walt Disney Pictures and Lucasfilm have scheduled the Han Solo movie for May 25th, 2018, but there continues to be speculation that the film could be moved to December, 2018 to fit in with the December releases of the other Star Wars movies (like this year’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, scheduled for December 16, 2016). As for Alden Ehrenreich, he’s a young (26) actor who has been bubbling up in mostly supporting roles for a few years now, but he was the male lead in 2013’s Beautiful Creatures, and many Coen brothers fans might remember him recently as the singing cowboy in Hail, Caesar!&nbsp;There are also rumors that Ehrenreich may actually make his debut as Han Solo in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story as well, which might be why casting was done so early for the film (even though the Han Solo movie doesn’t start filming until early 2017, several months from now).Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN DR. JEKYLL: RUSSELL CROWE JOINS THE MUMMY, ELLEN PRODUCES JEKYLL MOVIEIt’s probably due to the competitive nature of Hollywood, but frequently in film development news, we see randomly matched movies make the news within the same week. This week, for example, it’s Dr. Jekyll (a la Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde). Although Jekyll and Hyde are something of a literary ur-text (if only for providing the template for 50+ years of The Incredible Hulk), it’s not exactly one of those classic horror stories that one necessarily thinks of as having a rabid fanbase (unlike, say vampires, werewolves, zombies, etc.). This week of Jekyll news started with the bigger story, which is that Russell Crowe is in talks with Universal Pictures to costar in The Mummy (6/9/17) as a “Dr. Jekyll-type role” (which most writers are interpreting as actually being Dr. Jekyll).&nbsp;The Mummy is the first film in what Universal Pictures is hoping will be a new “cinematic universe” revolving around modern reboots of their classic monsters. Johnny Depp is already known to be attached to star in a reboot of The Invisible Man, and new versions of Dracula, Bride of Frankenstein (possibly starring Angelina Jolie), and The Creature from the Black Lagoon are also expected to be part of the mix eventually. Likewise, it’s expected that if Russell Crowe’s appearance as “Dr. Jekyll” in The Mummy is successful, a solo movie for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde will part of this new cinematic universe.&nbsp;The Mummy will be released next summer on June 19, 2017, and it will be followed by unknown movies on April 13, 2018 (possibly the date for Depp’s The Invisible Man) and February 15, 2019 (this one might be Bride of Frankenstein&nbsp;or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde). The Russell Crowe story was followed a day later by news that comedienne Ellen DeGeneres is producing a new feature film adapting the 2007 six-episode mini-series Jekyll, in which James Nesbitt playesa modern day descendant of the original Dr. Jekyll. Apparently, DeGeneres really liked Jekyll. In related news (circling back to Russell Crowe again), there was also a story this week about Russell Crowe starring in an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian. That one didn’t last long, however, because as it turns out, the producers hadn’t actually secured the rights to make such a movie, so the deal has already fallen apart.2. THIS WEEK IN DC COMICS PART 1: THE FLASH LOSES ITS DIRECTOR — BAD NEWS OR GOOD NEWS?The fans who bought their opening weekend tickets for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice helped the movie ensure a very robust opening weekend, but once news of the Rotten Tomatometer for the film hit, its box office take became sluggish. This has led in recent weeks to reports/rumors that within Warner Bros, there might be pressure to&nbsp;make&nbsp;future DC Comics movies, you know, more “fun” (a formula that seems to work for Marvel Studios). For some movies, this sort of course correction is particularly difficult (such as the first Justice League movie, which director Zack Snyder has already started filming). One movie that it’s potentially still early enough to change is The Flash, which this week, screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith&nbsp;decided would not be his directorial debut, due to “creative differences.” Grahame-Smith is best known for writing the novels Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, as well as adapting Tim Burton’s Dark Shadows. This news comes even as the second season of the fan favorite TV series The Flash nears its end (which some fans would love to see be adapted as the movie instead of the version starring Ezra Miller). There was also a story this week that Fast 7 director James Wan was beginning&nbsp;to feel a “tremendous amount of trepidation” about directing DC Comics’ Aquaman.&nbsp; In response, Wan tweeted out a picture of himself under a mural of Aquaman, saying (in reference to BMD writer Devin Faraci), “Please, there’s no absolutely no need to attack Devin, or anyone.” Which wasn’t a confirmation or a denial of Faraci’s story (and indeed, a director could have “trepidation” about directing a movie, and still stay committed to directing it). As for how Warner Bros might be attempting to make Justice League Part One as successful as possible, this week, we learned that costar Ben Affleck will also be assisting Zack Snyder as one of the film’s executive producers.&nbsp; Warner Bros has scheduled Justice League Part One for release on November 17, 2017.3.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN DC COMICS PART 2: BEN AFFLECK THROWING THE KITCHEN SINK AT THE BATMAN?Some of his stories might lead to changes that eventually make his stories archaic, but one thing you can give Devin Faraci of Birth.Movies.Death credit for lately is that his reportage is&nbsp;being read by people very far up the filmmaking ladder (directors, producers, executives, etc). So, this week, there were two different DC Comics stories from BMD that both received a lot of social media attention. The first was about Aquaman (see above), and the second was about Ben Affleck’s solo Batman movie (which he’s also writing, directing, and producing).&nbsp;Faraci claims that he has heard that Ben Affleck’s screenplay is “going to be crammed with Bat villains, which means that just about every major bad guy you’ve ever wanted to see in a movie will be in this movie.” Faraci’s story does not go on to clarify which villains exactly he’s talking about, but a short list of the major Batman villains would have to include (correct us if we forget any) at least: The Joker, Catwoman, The Penguin, The Riddler, Bane, Black Mask, Calendar Man, Clayface, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Ra’s Al Ghul, Scarecrow, Solomon Grundy, Two Face, Victor Zsasz, and if we’re being TV show completionists, let’s thrown in King Tut and Egghead, too. If this story plays out as mostly correct, that would mean that Ben Affleck (and Warner Bros) are playing much contrary to the popular sentiment that too many villains usually results in a less satisfying superhero movie. Or is it possible that Ben Affleck is exactly trying to defeat that notion?&nbsp; And if he’s right, and this works for The Batman, might we see future superhero movies (including Marvel’s) featuring more “villain ensembles?”4. WE MAY NOW KNOW WHO EXACTLY ARE IN X-MEN: THE NEW MUTANTSDepending upon a) your knowledge of Marvel’s The New Mutants and b) your skepticism about how superhero movie casts are devised, this might either be an exciting revelation or an annoying non-story. Wherever you fall, this was still a story picked up by multiple sources, so we’re calling it one of the week’s top 10. Director Josh Boone used his Instagram account this week to post a series of comic book images which are being interpreted as announcing the cast of his next film, X-Men: The New Mutants. The resulting list of seven characters is composed of all of the original New Mutants (except Vietnamese mind controller Karma), and two of the most popular later members (Magik and Warlock), but not Warlock’s best friend (Cypher), or the star of the X-Men: Legends video game (Magma). To be specific, the characters Boone seemed to confirm are: Cannonball, Mirage (Dani Moonstar), Sunspot, Wolfsbane, Magik, and Warlock (who himself is an alien, not a human mutant, though some interpret him as being an alien mutant). Warlock’s inclusion is also interesting because Marvel has another character called Warlock (aka Adam Warlock), who might be included in a future film (either Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, or one of the Infinity War movies, which probably won’t be called that after all). In other Marvel news (which there was a lot of this week, thanks to Captain America: Civil War), there was a possible revelation about one of the heroes that might debut in the next Avengers movie, as well as talk about whether or not&nbsp;Black Widow will ever get a solo movie.5. DAISY RIDLEY TO STAR IN REVISIONIST HAMLET ADAPTATION OPHELIADaisy Ridley is obviously going to be very busy in the next few years starring in the next two Star Wars episodes, but her agents are busy keeping her (likewise) busy in between those shoots. (And that’s despite Alicia Vikander landing the Tomb Raider reboot instead of her.) One such project made the news this week, and its title pretty much gives away exactly what it is: Ophelia.&nbsp; Daisy Ridley will star as the titular character in Ophelia, which is a revisionist adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, seen from the perspective of his great love, the daughter of Polonius. Naomi Watts will also costar as Queen Gertrude, and none of their male costars have been announced yet.6.&nbsp;WILL THE CATS MOVIE BE WORTH SEEING AGAIN AND AGAIN?Over the years, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s long-running Broadway musical Cats has been the subject of jokes in everything from Saturday Night Live to Team America: World Police (NSFW). What has eluded Cats since its Broadway debut 35 years ago is its own big budget feature film adaptation. Such a movie now appears to be nearing reality, as Universal Pictures has signed director Tom Hooper to produce and direct a a big screen adaptation. Based on&nbsp;poems by T.S. Elliot, Cats depicts through song and dance (and “furry” style costumes and makeup) the lives of the cats of the Jellicle tribe with names like Munkustrap, Asparagus, Old Deuteronomy, Rum Tum Tugger, and of course, the Magical Mister Mistoffelees. Tom Hooper previously worked with Universal Pictures on their adapation of the hit musical Les Miserables in 2012, which was both a box office success, and the winner of three Academy Awards.7.&nbsp;FUTURE $20 FACE HARRIET TUBMAN TO ALSO GET HER FACE IN A BIOPICIt was just about two weeks ago that the news broke that the U.S. Treasury was going to add the face of anti-slavery activist and abolitionist Harriet Tubman to future printings of the $20 bill.&nbsp; That may have prompted some producers in Hollywood to realize that the life of Harriet Tubman has been portrayed in feature films a lot less often than one might expect.&nbsp;And that is our cue to mention director Seith Mann, who has worked mostly on TV shows like Showtime’s Homeland, Nurse Jackie, and Californication. Mann has started development on a biopic called Harriet, about the abolitionist icon who&nbsp;was born into slavery in 1822, but escaped in 1847 to become a spy for the Union Army, and a key element of the Underground Railroad, running missions to save at least 70 slaves. Mann plans to start filming Harriet in early 2017, working from a screenplay by Gregory Allen Howard (Ali, Remember the Titans). Harriet Tubman is not expected to first appear on the $20 bill until 2020, so this movie will probably be able to be produced and released before Tubman makes her paper money debut.8. ANCHORMAN DIRECTOR ADAM MCKAY TO ADAPT SUPERVILLAIN COMIC IRREDEEMABLEDirector/producer Adam McKay started his career on Saturday Night Live, and then directed such Will Ferrell comedies as the two Anchorman movies, Step Brothers, and The Other Guys. Most recently, McKay directed the Academy Award-nominated financial dramedy The Big Short. With this week’s news, he&nbsp;prepares to move into the world of superhero movies, but he’s not doing it by adapting a title published by DC or Marvel (or even Image or Dark Horse). Instead, McKay is now attached to direct Fox’s adaptation of the Boom! Comics title Irredeemable, which ran for 37 issues from 2009 to 2012. Mark Waid (Kingdom Come) created and wrote Irredeemable, about a superhero called “The Plutonian” who went from being the most loved superhero on Earth to becoming a supervillain attempting to destroy all human life (with the comics’ analogy to the Justice League opposed to him). Adam McKay will be working from a screenplay by Tommy Wirkola, who is also himself the director of movies like Dead Snow, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, and the gonzo horror comedy sequel Dead Snow 2: Red vs Dead.Rotten Idea of The Week1. HOLLYWOOD TO MAKE SLENDER MAN MOVIE (NO WAY THAT COULD GO HORRIBLY WRONG…)If you grew up in the world before “social media” (and especially before The Internet took off in the 1990s), how you interpreted things as a child might have been different from how (some) kids are growing up today. That, at least, might have been a lesson that some people took away from the news, about two years ago that two 12 year old girls had stabbed another girl trying to impress the fictional character called Slender Man,&nbsp;who has appeared in various forms as part of an extensive “Internet meme” that include short stories, “true story” testimonials, YouTube videos, and video games. Ever since the whole Slender Man&nbsp;thing took off, it was probably always inevitable that someone, somewhere would adapt it as a horror film. And now we know that exactly such a film is in the works, thanks to Screen Gems and Mythology Entertainment.&nbsp; That production company is also currently developing The Overlook Hotel, a prequel to Stephen King’s The Shining.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"natural, dogs, Emmys, Comics, movie, RT21, guild, Trophy, Hallmark","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/06163804/Alden-Ehrenreich-Han-Solo.jpg","slug":"alden-ehrenreich-is-officially-young-han-solo-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509194714550","title":"Plastic Man v Elongated Man Is Happening, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Plastic Man v Elongated Man Is Happening, and More Movie NewsBryan Cranston, Kevin Hart, Robin Wright, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, David Oyelowo, Julia Roberts, and Bradley Cooper all land new roles.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 1, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Blade Runner 2, Rose Red, Backyard Sports, and a remake of John Carpenter’s Starman.This Week’s Top StoryPLASTIC MAN V ELONGATED MAN: MORNING STRETCHESIf this week’s top news is true, Warner Bros is apparently responding to the criticism of how grimdark Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is (and the 29 percent Tomatometer score that came with that approach). That’s because there have been reports&nbsp;that WB is now implementing a new film that effectively spoofs themselves with some colorfully retro FUN, spelled with capital F-U-N. The film in question will be called Plastic Man v Elongated Man: Morning Stretches, as the two stretchy superheroes take on the goofy challenges of Superman villains Mr. Mxyzptlk and Bizarro, neither of whom you’re likely see in a movie starring Henry Cavill. Just as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice introduced us to the dark and serious members of Zack Snyder’s Justice League films, it’s expected that the Plastic Man team-up movie will not only introduce Elongated Man, but also other goofy/fun classic DC heroes like B’wana Beast, Ambush Bug, The Inferior Five, and the Legion of Super Pets, all of whom may then spin off into their own brightly lit and lightly humored big screen adventures, suitable for the whole family. Or maybe this is an April Fool’s Day joke (which it totally is). In related actual news, the idea that DC Comics movies should have more jokes and “fun” did make headlines this week. According to Devin Faraci of Birth.Movies.Death, this summer’s Suicide Squad is preparing for major reshoots that will add “more humor and lightness into the film.” Ben Affleck has also apparently written a Batman solo script, as reported this week, and while it’s unclear how jokey it will be, one can always hope!Fresh Developments This Week1. KEVIN HART MAY TAKE CARE OF BRYAN CRANSTON IN THE INTOUCHABLESOne of the biggest mysteries of 2011’s global box office numbers for many people was likely the success of&nbsp;Intouchables, a French comedy hit that ended up with north of $420 million. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy (Bishop from X-Men: Days of Future Past) starred in that film as a wealthy disabled man and the ex-con who takes care of him, respectively. We’ve known for a while that The Weinstein Company was developing an English-language remake of The Intouchables, but what wasn’t known was who would play the two main characters. The answer is that Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) and Kevin Hart (Ride Along) are now both in talks for the remake. At one point, Colin Firth had been a possibility to star as the wheelchair-bound man, apparently when the character might have been British.2. DAVID OYELOWO AND&nbsp;GUGU MBATHA-RAW&nbsp;DISCOVER J.J. ABRAMS’ GOD PARTICLEIn addition to his work directing the rebooted entries in both the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises, J.J. Abrams also keeps quite busy as a producer with his Bad Robot production company.&nbsp; The latest hit for Bad Robot was 10 Cloverfield Lane, which was heavily billed crediting Abrams, even though he&nbsp;didn’t write or direct the film. Another science fiction thriller that Abrams and Bad Robot will be producing soon is called God Particle, and we now know two of the film’s stars. Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Belle, Concussion) and David Oyelowo (Selma, Interstellar) have signed on to play two of the members of a team of astronauts who “make a terrifying discovery that challenges all they know about the fabric of reality, as they desperately fight for their survival.” Production is expected to start soon, and Paramount Pictures has already scheduled God Particle for release on February 24, 2017.3.&nbsp;ROBIN WRIGHT JOINS HARRISON FORD IN BLADE RUNNER SEQUELIf you’re interested in next year’s Wonder Woman, you may already know that Robin Wright will costar in that film as an Amazon military leader (and you may have also seen this image,&nbsp;and these images), and as of this week, she’s also attached to&nbsp;another highly-anticipated genre film. Although we don’t know the nature of her character, Robin Wright is now in final talks to join Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling in the long-in-development sequel to Blade Runner. Warner Bros has already scheduled the film for release on January 12, 2018 (although some speculate that the film could open in limited release in late 2017 for awards consideration).4. IT’S NO APRIL JOKE: JULIA ROBERTS TO STAR IN FOOL ME ONCEYou really do have to wonder sometimes about the timing of casting announcements (and many times, you’re curiosity is well founded). Take, for example, the news this week (which ended on April Fool’s Day) that Julia Roberts is now attached to star in a thriller called Fool Me Once. Roberts will also produce the film, which will be an adaptation of a novel recently published by author Harlan Coben. In Fool Me Once, Roberts will play a “Special Ops pilot just home from war” who sees her dead husband on her young daughter’s nannycam.Rotten Ideas of The Week5.&nbsp;VIDEO GAME FRANCHISE BACKYARD SPORTS TO RE-IMAGINE PRO ATHLETES AS LITTLE KIDSThirty years in, the video game industry is now worth billions of dollars every year, and there are hundreds of games released in various formats. That might be why this writer has never heard of Backyard Sports (which Wikipedia informs us will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2017). The premise of the games, which have covered such sports as baseball, basketball, football, soccer, hockey, and skateboarding, is that major professional athletes are re-imagined as young kids. That’s also going to be the approach taken by the newly announced feature film adaptation of Backyard Sports, which will be produced by the same company, Cross Creek Pictures, as such recent films as A Walk Among the Tombstones, Aftershock, Everest, and this summer’s horror film, Clown. We’re calling this one a borderline “Rotten Idea” just because it seems sort of corny that there’s going to be a movie about kid-sized versions of sports stars (ala that time NBA stars costarred in Space Jam?).4.&nbsp;ALSO THIS WEEK IN ASTRONAUT MOVIES: BRADLEY COOPER GOES DEEPER&nbsp;We can probably credit the success of both Gravity and The Martian, but there definitely are a lot more “astronaut movies” in development and production than you would have seen in the news just a few years ago. One screenwriter who is benefitting from this new trend is Max Landis (American Ultra, Victor Frankenstein), who currently has a screenplay called Deeper up for auction between several major studios. That film also already has Bradley Cooper attached to star. Cooper will play a “disgraced astronaut who embarks on a mission to reach the bottom of a newly-discovered oceanic trench, which some speculate may be the lowest point on Earth. Facing great danger, he quickly finds himself in a physical and psychological fight against mysterious forces.”&nbsp; We’re calling this one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, because since making his debut with Chronicle, Max Landis’ three subsequent films have all received Rotten Tomatometer scores.3.&nbsp;DISNEY AND HUNTSMAN SCREENWRITER TEAMING UP FOR SNOW WHITE’S SISTER, ROSE REDFor whatever reason, the Brothers Grimm’s fairy tale character Rose Red has never become as famous in the USA as her sister, Snow White. An obvious answer might be that Walt Disney didn’t use her in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and that’s the story that has since been adapted the most, and not the one actually featuring Rose Red. It appears, however, that Walt Disney Pictures is now moving towards correcting the last 70 years of oversight, because the studio is now developing a live-action feature film about Rose Red. There has actually been talk about such a film before, but the other big news this week is that the Rose Red feature film will also incorporate elements of her sister Snow White’s more famous story (the one with the apple, the dwarves, etc). Curiously, the screenwriter that Disney has hired to do this is Evan Daugherty, who previously cowrote another film about one of the same characters, 2012’s Snow White and the Huntsman.&nbsp;We’re calling this one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas” because none of Evan Daugherty’s four films to date have yet earned a Fresh Tomatometer score.2.&nbsp;BIG CASTING NEWS FOR THE NEW MUTANTS IS… QUICKLY DEBUNKEDIn a week where people tend to be naturally suspicious about big casting news (especially in a superhero movie), one story squeaked through Thursday night and seemed credible enough that a lot of people still believed it (including this writer, honestly). Perhaps you already saw this one, too. The (now debunked) news story claimed that director Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars) had already cast two of the New Mutants, and that it would be Maisie Williams (Game of Thrones) and Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch) as Wolfsbane and Magik, respectively. The same story had the teen version of Storm (Alexandra Shipp) cast in the film (which is scheduled for release in 2018). Unfortunately, the blog The Nerdist was able to quickly confirm with 20th Century Fox that basically none of that was true.&nbsp;And that’s why we’re calling this a “Rotten Idea:” 1) because we were all “fooled” so easily, and most of all, 2) Maisie Williams and Anya-Taylor-Joy might have both been great choices for those characters!1.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN REMAKES: JOHN CARPENTER’S STARMANMidnight Special is a Certified Fresh science fiction drama currently platforming from limited release to wide release, which many critics have noted pays loving homage to the films of the 1980s like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and John Carpenter’s Starman. Carpenter’s film also seemed to be paid homage by James Gunn in his 2014 Marvel film, Guardians of the Galaxy. Any or all of that might be the reason for this week’s arguably “Most Rotten News,” which is that Starman is going to be remade. The remake will be directed by Shawn Levy, whose Tomatometer as director has a lot of Rotten green splotches, including all three Night at the Museum movies, the 2013 comedy The Internship, and the 2006 remake of The Pink Panther. The Starman remake will also be adapted by screenwriter Arash Amel, who previously worked on the Princess Grace biopic, Grace of Monaco, which received a Tomatometer score of just 10 percent.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"christmas, Oscars, films, police, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/01165112/PlasticManKetchup.jpg","slug":"plastic-man-v-elongated-man-is-happening-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509193463215","title":"Margot Robbie May Get Her Own Harley Quinn Spinoff, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Margot Robbie May Get Her Own Harley Quinn Spinoff, and More Movie NewsMore casting news for the all-female Ocean's Eleven and Thor: Ragnarok, plus new roles for Dwayne Johnson, Helen Mirren, and Adam Driver. Oh, and a Tetris trilogy.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 20, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Tetris, Thor: Ragnarok, Transformers: The Last Knight, and the all-female Ocean’s Eleven spinoff.This Week’s Top StoryMARGOT ROBBIE MAY STAR IN HARLEY QUINN SPINOFFWarner Bros’ “super villain team” movie Suicide Squad is still over two months away from release (8/5/16), but this week, we heard news that suggests the studio has high hopes about the film’s critical and box office success. (Which they really need after the 27 percent Rotten rating Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice received.) Reportedly, actress Margot Robbie pitched Warner Bros on the idea of her character Harley Quinn getting her own spinoff, which will feature an ensemble cast of other female DC Comics characters. Which characters might join Harley Quinn aren’t yet known, but Batgirl and the Birds of Prey (who include Black Canary, Catwoman, and Huntress) are all seen as top contenders. That wasn’t the only news about Margot Robbie this week, though, as Robbie is also now in early talks to costar in the biopic Goodbye Christopher Robin, about children’s author A.A. Milne, creator of the Winnie the Pooh characters. Domhnall Gleeson is cast as A.A. Milne, and if she signs on, Robbie would play his wife. Going back to the DC Comics movies and their future, there was also the news this week that Warner Bros is shaking up its corporate leadership following the release of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Specifically, the DC Comics adaptations will now be run by current EVP Jon Berg and DC Comics “chief content officer” Geoff Johns, who comics fans will recognize as a key writer of many of their most popular stories over the last ten years or so. Speaking of the new tone that he hopes to bring to future DC Comics movies, Johns used the phrase “optimism and hope” as something he hopes to bring to the films.&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice director Zack Snyder is still, however, attached to direct Justice League: Part One, scheduled for November 17, 2017.Fresh Developments This Week1. JENNIFER LAWRENCE MIGHT JOIN SANDRA BULLOCK’S OCEAN’S ELEVEN SPINOFF?We still don’t know yet if Jennifer Lawrence will return as Mystique in more films past this month’s X-Men: Apocalypse. Even if she doesn’t, this week brought news of another potential franchise for Lawrence after The Hunger Games and X-Men. The key factor here is director Gary Ross (Seabiscuit, Pleasantville), who directed the first Hunger Games movie, and is now developing the “all female” spinoff of Ocean’s Eleven. We’ve known since October that Sandra Bullock was attached to be the first of the movie’s ensemble (potentially the “Clooney” in this group). This week brought the news that Gary Ross may be eyeing Jennifer Lawrence as an addition to the female group of heist planners and confidence ladies. This news also confirms that the film is not really a reboot, but instead a soft spinoff, with Bullock playing Danny Ocean’s sister, and Jennifer Lawrence her “right hand woman” as they plan to “steal a necklace from the Met Ball and frame a crooked gallery owner.” Warner Bros has not yet given the all-female Ocean’s Eleven spinoff a release date, though it’s possible it could be one of their secret “event’ dates (like the one that WB has scheduled for November 16, 2018).2. THOR: RAGNAROK ADDS THREE MAJOR MARVEL SUPER VILLAINSOne outstanding complaint that some have long had about Marvel’s MCU films involves a perceived lack of villains as intimidating as the title heroes. For example, Ant-Man didn’t even have a classic villain, with one of Pym’s alter-egos (Yellowjacket) serving as the “villain” instead. With today’s news, Marvel Studios may be hinting a move toward implementing bigger and more threatening villains in future films. Via their official site, Marvel Studios has announced two new villains for Thor: Ragnarok, and revealed the characters played by previously announced actresses. Karl Urban (Star Trek, Dredd) has been cast as Skurge the Executioner, and Jeff Goldblum (more about him in just a bit) has been cast as The Grandmaster, the MCU’s second Elder of the Universe, after The Collector (Guardians of the Galaxy). The previously announced Cate Blanchett and Tessa Thompson (Creed) have also been confirmed as playing Hela (Loki’s daughter, and the ruler of Hel) and Valkyrie (presumably, Brunnhilde). One character missing from this announcement is Amora the Enchantress, who is traditionally Skurge’s partner against Thor (but DC’s inclusion of another character called “The Enchantress” in Suicide Squad might explain her absence here). Thor: Ragnarok will be directed by Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows), and Marvel has scheduled the film for November 3, 2017. The casting of Jeff Goldblum may have led to another major Marvel story this week. Those who follow film development news closely might remember that when Michael Keaton dropped out of contention for playing a villain in Spider-Man: Homecoming (7/7/17), Jeff Goldblum was reportedly the top contender to replace him. Well, now that Goldblum is playing The Grandmaster in Thor: Ragnarok, we are also now hearing that Keaton is back in talks&nbsp;to costar in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Marvel isn’t officially saying who he might play, but long-time Spidey villain The Vulture remains a popular guess.3. THIS WEEK IN DWAYNE JOHNSON: THE “LUDLUM CINEMATIC UNIVERSE,” AND DOC SAVAGE TOO?There may be more franchises and would-be “cinematic universes” now than ever before, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that there are more legitimate (franchise-worthy) “movie stars” these days. As a result,&nbsp;studios are increasingly vying for attention from the same consistently proven movie stars (let’s wave at Jennifer Lawrence up above, folks!) to help launch their franchises with the required star power. One such actor is Dwayne Johnson, who, in addition to the Fast &amp; Furious&nbsp;movies,&nbsp;has also added his star power to the Journey, G.I. Joe, and San Andreas franchises, and also has Baywatch, Disney’s Moana and the video game adaptation Rampage in the works. This week brought news of two more.&nbsp;The studio that is specifically throwing around the “cinematic universe” is Universal Pictures, which has now attached Dwayne Johnson to star in The Janson Directive, based on a novel by espionage author Robert Ludlum (AKA the writer of&nbsp;the Jason Bourne books/movies). Dwayne Johnson will star in The Janson Directive as “a former clandestine operative, now the best private security consultant in the world, who is framed for a horrendous crime and must join forces with the protégée sent to kill him in order to survive.” Screenwriter James Vanderbilt (Zodiac; cowriter of The Amazing Spider-Man) will both adapt The Janson Directive and continue to develop adaptations of other Robert Ludlum novels (Vanderbilt previously wrote for Johnson on The Rundown). It’s yet unclear if the Johnson/Vanderbilt “Ludlum Cinematic Universe” will also connect to the continuity of Universal’s “Bourne” films. Dwayne Johnson also seemed to tease on Instagram this week that he might be working with director Shane Black (The Nice Guys) next year on his long-in-development adaptation of the pulp hero Doc Savage.&nbsp; Johnson doesn’t come right out and say, however, that he would be playing Doc Savage (since he could be playing any other character in the movie). Having said that, most people are interpreting the tease that way, and it does seem more likely that Johnson would himself play Doc Savage. Perhaps Shane Black or the studio will confirm Johnson’s involvement and role&nbsp;soon.4. HELEN MIRREN TO PLAY DUPED HEIRESS IN WINCHESTERAfter Fresh Tomatometer scores for their two most recent films (Daybreakers and Predestination) the Australian directing team of brothers Michael and Peter Spierig may be just one hit from being the “next big thing” as directors. For their next film, the Spierig Brothers are tackling the true story of rifle heiress Sarah Winchester (1840-1922)&nbsp;who reportedly believed her family was cursed by the spirits of the people killed by the Winchester rifles that helped settle the Wild West (and other areas). This reportedly led Winchester to commission the building of the sprawling 160-room “Winchester Mystery House,” which remains a popular tourist destination in Northern California. After working with Ethan Hawke as the star of their last two movies, the Spierig Brothers are now working with a female star, because Helen Mirren is in final talks to star in Winchester as the aforementioned heiress. Filming of Winchester is scheduled to start in early 2017 in both San Jose, California and on sets in Australia.5. ADAM DRIVER JOINS THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE (WHICH IS FINALLY HAPPENING?)It has been so long now (14 years!) since the 2002 documentary Lost in La Mancha, about a doomed film production by director Terry Gilliam,&nbsp;that most&nbsp;have probably long since accepted&nbsp;Gilliam’s&nbsp;movie would never be made. That movie was called The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, and in its original incarnation, it was to star Johnny Depp as a man who travels back in time to have an adventure with the real inspiration for Miguel de Cervantes’&nbsp;Don Quixote. Well, it appears it’s really happening this time, with confirmation that Gilliam has funding to start filming The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, starting in October of 2016 at locations in Spain, Portugal, and the Canary Islands. Instead of Johnny Depp, the lead will now be Adam Driver, AKA “Kylo Ren” and the costar of HBO’s Girls.&nbsp;Monty Python member Michael Palin will play Don Quixote, and Olga Kurylenko (Oblivion) will play the film’s female lead.6. DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS TO BE REBOOTED BY KID-FRIENDLY GOOSEBUMPS DIRECTOROne advantage of an older intellectual property being adapted for the first time&nbsp;might be that it doesn’t have to overcome the bad reputation of a poorly received previous attempt. The classic role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons, for example, was first adapted as live action in 2000, which led to two direct-to-video sequels and an animated Dragonlance movie — and none of them has a Tomatometer score above the a very Rotten 10 percent. Warner Bros still (and rightly so, this writer thinks) sees Dungeons &amp; Dragons as a potentially lucrative property, since there are hundreds of adventures laid out in very narrative terms in both “module” form and novels.&nbsp; Although Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;still retains an avid adult audience 40 years on, Warner Bros appears to be approaching the first film as a more kid-/family-friendly adventure. That’s because director Rob Letterman is now attached to direct the Dungeons &amp; Dragons reboot. Letterman made his directorial debut collaborating on DreamWorks’ 2004 film Shark Tale&nbsp;and co-directed Monsters vs Aliens, then directed the live action movies Gulliver’s Travels and last year’s adaptation of Goosebumps (both starring Jack Black). The latter was also the sort of “monster ensemble” adventure approach that one might imagine Letterman could apply to his version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.Rotten Ideas of The Week3. THE INSIDIOUS FRANCHISE TO CONTINUE IN LATE 2017 WITH CHAPTER 4When the horror film Insidious debuted as the entry in a new franchise in 2011, the relatively star-studded pairing of Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne may have helped the film earn a Fresh Tomatometer score of 66 percent. Wilson and Byrne returned for Insidious: Chapter 2, but that film dropped to a Rotten 39 percent, and after they left, the third film received a Rotten score in 2015 as well. Universal Pictures doesn’t seem dissuaded, however, as the studio has announced plans for Insidious: Chapter 4, which they have now scheduled for release on October 20, 2017. Lin Shaye, who is the only actor to appear in all three films to date, will also return as her parapsychologist character, for this fourth film. Director Adam Robitel, who made his feature film debut with The Taking of Deborah Logan, will make his studio debut with Insidious: Chapter 4.2.&nbsp;JOSH DUHAMEL TO RETURN FOR TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHTAfter taking a break for the fourth movie (allowing Mark Wahlberg to take over), Josh Duhamel is now confirmed to return for the fifth Transformers movie. That film, which is now called Transformers: The Last Knight, has been scheduled by Paramount Pictures for June 23, 2017, setting up an annual release schedule that will be followed by the Bumblebee movie on June 8, 2018. Director Michael Bay and Mark Wahlberg are both also returning for this fifth film, whose new logo font has also led to some speculation. Specifically, many are seeing a resemblance to the font used by Hasbro (and Marvel) for their toy/comic Rom: Spaceknight, which Paramount and Hasbro are also known to be developing into a future feature film and which many Marvel Comics fans who grew up in the late 1970s and in the 1980s may fondly remember. If this speculation is correct, it might just be that Rom: Spaceknight could be coming to movie theaters in the summer of 2018 (or it might all just be a huge fakeout).1. CHINESE PRODUCERS PLANNING BIG BUDGET TETRIS TRILOGY. YES, REALLY.&nbsp;China’s growing filmmaking industry is really flexing its muscles in 2016, as it currently holds the #6, #9, and #10 spots in the year’s top global box office earners to date.&nbsp; Thus far, many of China’s most ambitious projects have been based on Chinese/Asian mythology, but one of this week’s top stories suggests that Chinese producers are also eyeing other types of adaptations. Specifically, businessman Bruno Wu is teaming up with Mortal Kombat producer Larry Kasanoff to start development on a $80 million coproduction&nbsp;that will be the first of a planned trilogy of films based on the Russian “falling block” game Tetris. The quasi-ridiculous thing here is that we’re now eight years past the debut of the Tetris short film that (mostly jokingly) suggested that someday, someone would try to adapt Tetris as a live action movie. The first Tetris movie will film at least partly in China and feature Chinese actors in “prominent positions.”","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Star, Binge, rt, cults, political, Mary, pirates, Signature, rotten","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20162342/Margot-Robbie-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"margot-robbie-may-get-her-own-harley-quinn-spinoff-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509193467312","title":"Marvel’s Kevin Feige is Committed to Doing A Black Widow Movie, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Marvel's Kevin Feige is Committed to Doing A Black Widow Movie, and More NewsNew roles for Lupita Nyong'o, Joaquin Phoenix, Eddie Redmayne, and Will Ferrell, and March of the Penguins gets a sequel.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 13, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Black Panther, Godzilla vs Kong, and March of the Penguins 2: The Call.This Week’s Top StoryMARVEL IS NOW “COMMITTING” TO A SOLO BLACK WIDOW MOVIEIn the comics, Black Widow was actually the 15th super hero to join The Avengers (in between #14 Black Knight and #16 Mantis). The Marvel Cinematic Universe has lots and lots of differences from the comics, however, and one of them is that Marvel really “lucked out” when they cast Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow in 2010’s Iron Man 2, making her&nbsp;one of the original team members in The Avengers, right up there with Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Incredible Hulk. (In the comics, the female co-founder of the Avengers was the Wasp; indeed, she was the character who gave the team its name.) Scarlett Johansson has now appeared in five Marvel movies as Black Widow, but she has yet to star in&nbsp;her own solo Black Widow movie. This week, however, as people “did press” to promote Captain America: Civil War, there were two interesting quotes that suggest the Black Widow movie is finally closer to happening. Marvel Studios currently has nine movies scheduled from now until the end of 2019, including four team movies and five solo films (including Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and yes, Ant-Man and the Wasp). So, what’s in the works for 2020 and beyond? That question was poised to Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige recently, and he came right out and said what many fans have been asking for. Responding to a list that included Falcon, Hawkeye, and War Machine, Kevin Feige replied, “Of the characters that you’ve just mentioned I would say certainly the one creatively and emotionally that we are most committing to doing is Black Widow.” Feige also clarified that discussions were “ongoing,” so Marvel is not yet ready to confirm Black Widow, but… they’re working on it. Marvel announced their slate extending to 2019 in 2014,&nbsp;so there’s a very good chance that 2016 might be the year that they announce their Phase 4 films for 2020 and beyond. And Black Widow might be in there.Fresh Developments This Week1. LUPITA NYONG’O JOINS MARVEL’S BLACK PANTHER(Photo by Kevork Djansezian / Getty Images)&nbsp;To date, Kenyan-Mexican actress Lupita Nyong’o has only appeared in four feature films, but three of them were very “big deals.” Nyong’o won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for 12 Years a Slave, which&nbsp;seemingly helped her land major Disney roles in both Star Wars: The Force Awakens (as the alien Maz Kanata) and The Jungle Book (as the wolf mother Raksha). She&nbsp;will also star in Disney’s upcoming chess biopic Queen of Katwe (9/23/16), and will reprise the role of Maz Kanata in Star Wars: Episode VIII (12/15/17). This week, we learned that Lupita Nyong’o will continue working for Disney (and its subsidiaries) for the fifth movie (probably) in a row, as she is now in talks to star in Marvel’s Black Panther&nbsp;as the film’s main romantic interest for King T’Challa of Wakanda (as played by Chadwick Boseman). Nothing else is currently known about the role (though one Black Panther romantic interest we can rule out is his ex-wife, X-Men member&nbsp;Storm, since her movie rights are stuck at Fox). One possibility is that Nyong’o could be playing one of the Dora Milaje, Wakandan women of noble birth who serve as the king’s personal bodyguards (and potential wives). (Florence Kasumba played a “security chief” in Captain America: Civil War who may have been one of the Dora Milaje, but that hasn’t been confirmed by Marvel Studios yet). Marvel has scheduled Black Panther for release on February 16, 2018.&nbsp; [Last minute breaking news: Michael B. Jordan has also joined Black Panther&nbsp;in what might be a villain role (possibly M’Baku, the Man-Ape?). This will be the third time in a row that Jordan has costarred in a movie directed by Ryan Coogler, after starring in both Fruitvale Station and last year’s Rocky spinoff Creed. Jordan also recently costarred in Fox’s poorly received reboot of Marvel’s Fantastic Four.]2. KING KONG AND GODZILLA CONFIRMED TO FIGHT IN 2020This was a pretty big news week for one of the many “cinematic universes” that are in development (that aren’t Marvel, DC, or the Universal Monsters). It started with the announcement from Warner Bros of two new release dates for movies set in the same continuity as their 2014 reboot of Godzilla. The sequel to that movie (which will reportedly introduce reboots of Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah) is now scheduled for March 22, 2019 (which is a delay of over 9 months from June 8, 2018). Warner Bros also confirmed development of Godzilla vs Kong by way of a release date of May 29, 2020. That film will be both a Godzilla sequel and a sequel to next year’s Kong: Skull Island (3/10/17). It’s not yet known if any of the other giant monsters (Rodan, Mothra, etc) will also appear in Godzilla vs Kong, or how it will be a fair fight when one considers how much bigger Godzilla was in 2014 than King Kong usually is (though probably one or the other will somehow change size?). Earlier today, we learned the likely reason for the nine month delay of Godzilla 2, as Godzilla director Gareth Edwards has left the project,&nbsp;reportedly on equitable terms with Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures, due to an interest in focusing on “smaller” projects, after two major films in a row (Godzilla and the upcoming Rogue One: A Star Wars Story).3.&nbsp;ARE YOU READY TO RETURN TO ANTARCTICA (FOR THE SEQUEL MARCH OF THE PENGUINS 2: THE CALL)?Nature documentaries have been something of a niche genre for nearly as long as the film industry has been around, but only rarely have they&nbsp;become a major box office phenomenon. The most successful nature documentary ever ($127 million globally) was 2005’s March of the Penguins, which followed the Antarctic migrations of emperor penguins, as narrated by Morgan Freeman. This week at the Cannes Film Festival, it was revealed that a sequel called March of the Penguins 2: The Call has actually already been filmed, without the world knowing such a sequel was even in the works. Documentary director Luc Jacquet returned to Antarctica to tell a story of a young penguin’s journey as observed by a (much) older 45-year-old penguin. It isn’t yet known if Morgan Freeman will also be narrating this sequel, or if another voice actor will be taking over.4. PREMISE DEJA VU PART ONE: RIDLEY SCOTT TO DIRECT HIS FIRST WESTERN, WRAITHS OF THE BROKEN LANDOver his prolific career, director Ridley Scott has tackled several genres, from horror (Alien) and science fiction (Blade Runner, The Martian) to historical epics (Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven), and crime dramas (American Gangster, Matchstick Men). As he nears his 80th birthday (next year, on 11/30/17), the director appears to still have at least one more genre he wants to try out: The Western. We know that because Ridley Scott has signed with his frequent studio partners at Fox to direct an adaptation of the S. Craig Zahler 2013 novel Wraiths of the Broken Land. Set in Mexico around 1900, the film will tell the story of a father and his two sons who set out to rescue their sisters who have been forced into prostitution. S. Craig Zahler is also a film director, having recently adapted his own screenplay, the western horror film Bone Tomahawk. Ridley Scott recently started filming Alien: Covenant, and is committed to directing one more film (to make Prometheus the first of a new Alien trilogy). It’s not yet known when Scott will direct Wraiths of the Broken Land, or who might star in the film.5.&nbsp;PREMISE DEJA VU PART TWO: JOAQUIN PHOENIX AND YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HEREThe weekly film development frequently includes major news stories about movies with similar themes. The latest example of that happened this week as two different film projects were announced about men attempting to save women from prostitution and sex trafficking. Ridley Scott’s western Wraiths of the Broken Land is the first, and the second is a contemporary drama called You Were Never Really Here. Joaquin Phoenix is attached to star in the film,&nbsp;which is scheduled to start production this summer.&nbsp;You Were Never Really Here will be the next film from director Lynne Ramsay, who is possibly best known for the dramas We Need to Talk About Kevin and Morvern Callar (and for almost directing Jane Got a Gun). This Ramsay/Phoenix film is being compared to Drive, but the premise also sounds a little bit like Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver. Joaquin Phoenix will play a military veteran (like Robert De Niro’s Travis Bickle) who tries to rescue women “trapped in the world of sex trafficking” (similar to the plight suffered by Jodie Foster’s character).&nbsp;You Were Never Really Here was also one of this year’s major sales at the Cannes Film Festival, with A24 winning the distribution rights in the USA.6. EDDIE REDMAYNE JOINS CAVEMAN COMEDY EARLY MANSome forms of animated feature films take much longer than others to produce, so we get them less often. Consider, for example, the output of “stop motion” animation studio Aardman Studios. Since their first feature film (Chicken Run) sixteen years ago in 2000, Aardman has only produced six feature films, the most recent being last year’s Shaun the Sheep Movie. There has been talk for a while now that Aardman’s next stop-motion comedy adventure will be a “caveman” movie called Early Man. This week, we learned who will be providing one of the lead voices in Early Man, and it’s someone who isn’t really known for comedies. That’s because he is Eddie Redmayne, the Academy Award nominated (The Danish Girl) and winning (The Theory of Everything) actor. Redmayne will provide the voice of “plucky caveman Dug who, along with his sidekick Hognob, unites his tribe against the mighty Bronze Age in a battle to beat them at their own game.”&nbsp;Early Man will be directed by Aardman founder Nick Park, marking his first feature film as director since 2005’s The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.7. WILL FERRELL TO SAIL OFF IN FAMILY DRAMA AS CAPTAIN DADSebastian Silva is a Chilean director who has had a string of festival favorites (Magic Magic, Crystal Fairy, Nasty Baby), but thus far, he hasn’t&nbsp;had a crossover hit in the United States, even though he’s worked&nbsp;with Hollywood name actors like Michael Cera (who starred in both Magic Magic and Crystal Fairy). One of the films announced this week at Cannes was a family thriller called Captain Dad, which will unite Sebastian Silva with stars Will Ferrell, Catherine Keener, and for the third time, Michael Cera. Ferrell will play a middle aged father who celebrates his wife’s birthday (Keener) by piloting a Caribbean vacation along with all six of their kids and their various partners. Except he’s also not a very good sailor, so his incompetence leads to the vacation going very badly. Will Ferrell also made the news this week as one of the producers of a project called The Hustlers at Scores, about a group of strip club employees who plot a scheme to rip off their wealthy Wall Street clientele.8.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN DC COMICS RUMORS: A BOOSTER GOLD MOVIE, AND THE JUSTICE LEAGUE VILLAIN IS… ?News about film development projects comes to us through a few different avenues. Some sources are “official” (mostly) venues for material that comes directly from press and publicity releases, while others break big news stories via information provided to them “unofficially.” Devin Faraci’s movie site Birth.Movies.Death broke&nbsp;two major stories this week about Warner Bros’ plans for future DC Comics adaptations, and if they both turn out to be accurate, they are both fairly major “gets.” One is a story we’d call Fresh, and the second less so, but let’s start with the news that we really quite like:&nbsp;Screenwriter Zack Stentz (Thor, X-Men: First Class) is reportedly adapting the DC Comics character Booster Gold into a movie — which has been rumored for months — for Warner Bros.&nbsp;This&nbsp;may be very welcome news for people who feel that some of WB’s&nbsp;other DC films (like Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice) are not “fun” enough, since Booster Gold (and his frequent crimefighting partner Blue Beetle) is one of DC’s most comedic “fun” characters. The other potentially big story&nbsp;that Birth.Movies.Death may have broken this week&nbsp;is the identity of the main villain in WB’s Justice League Part One (11/17/17). We won’t come right out and say who it is, but if you’re expecting one of DC Comics’ most iconic and most popular super villains (and they have tons!), you’re probably going to be disappointed.Rotten Idea of The Week1. THIS WEEK IN VIDEO GAME MOVIES: ATARI’S CENTIPEDE AND MISSILE COMMANDThe video game industry is now into its fifth decade (figuring a rough start sometime in the early 1970s), but the marriage of video games and major Hollywood movies is a collective enterprise that has not yet fully taken off (at least compared to, say, comic book movies). That doesn’t mean, however, that producers aren’t developing potential projects for the day when a new audience might embrace more video game adaptations. 2016 is seen by many pundits as a potential breakthrough year, with such high profile game adaptations as Angry Birds, Warcraft, and Assassin’s Creed coming out. Video games do potentially have a lot of potential as feature film source material, but the argument can also be made that the simplest games don’t really fill “narrative” structure. That’s especially true of classic video games from the late 1970s and early 1980s, and that’s why we’re calling this story the week’s Rotten Idea. Unfortunately, development has started on two movie adaptations&nbsp;of the classic Atari arcade games Missile Command and Centipede. Both games involved “track ball” controls, as the players moved a cursor across the screen to prevent the horizontal advance of either a) approaching missiles attacking the player’s cities, or b) a centipede crawling through a bed of mushrooms (seriously!).&nbsp;Centipede was also recently one of the games prominently featured in Pixels, which received a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 17 percent.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Cartoon, Star, dragons, show, Family, hispanic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13161308/Scarlett-Johansson-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"marvels-kevin-feige-is-committed-to-doing-a-black-widow-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509193461166","title":"Big Names Floated as Next James Bond, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Big Names Floated as Next James Bond, and More Movie NewsNew roles for Jake Gyllenhaal, Mike Myers, Rebel Wilson, and Dwayne Johnson, plus a Fruit Ninja movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 27, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Fruit Ninja, Garfield, Halloween, and Power Rangers.This Week’s Top StoryWHO WILL STAR IN THE 25TH JAMES BOND MOVIE?Unlike almost any other movie series one can think of, the James Bond franchise is one of the most truly perennial, with 24 official films now released. Daniel Craig has starred in the last four films (Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, and last year’s Spectre), but whether he might return for a fifth has carried a conspicuous question mark for months (or even years) now. And that’s not the only question surrounding the 25th James Bond film, as Sony’s contract with EON expired with Spectre, and director Sam Mendes has also said he won’t be returning either. With all that&nbsp;said, most people define James Bond films by which actor plays him, so casting negotiations are the news that get the most press. Let’s start with Daniel Craig himself. This week, Craig (and Katherine Heigl) were reported to both be close to signing to star in the next film from director Steven Soderbergh (of the Ocean’s Eleven franchise), called Logan Lucky, about brothers who plan a heist during a NASCAR race in Charlotte. This story is rather pertinent to James Bond, because Eon Productions reportedly wants to start filming in the fall of 2016 (for a possible release in late 2017), which is&nbsp;also when Logan Lucky is scheduled to begin filming. This might suggest that Craig is indeed moving on from 007, but it could also just be that he knows James Bond 25 won’t film in late 2016 after all (or that he could otherwise just do both). So, who might replace Daniel Craig if he’s done with 007?&nbsp; The story that probably made the most news this week was the idea that Gillian Anderson (Agent Scully from The X-Files) might be willing to take over as “Jane” Bond. In addition to being the first woman Bond in the official franchise, Gillian Anderson would also be the first 007 born in the USA (she has dual citizenship in both the UK and the USA). There was also a story this week claiming that Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot, The Thing from Fantastic Four) has had “discussions” about taking over as 007. Finally, the movie blog Birth.Movies.Death ran a story this morning (just as Memorial Day weekend starts) reporting that it’s Tom Hiddleston&nbsp;(Marvel’s “Loki”) who is now in advanced talks to take over as James Bond from Daniel Craig. At the same time, they note that “no official offer has been made,” which suggests that these talks could be the same as those with Jamie Bell, or perhaps any other actor (such as the frequently mentioned Idris Elba). Hiddleston will soon start filming his role in Thor: Ragnarok (11/3/17), but it’s likely that he&nbsp;(not the film’s main villain this time around) would be done as Loki before the 25th James Bond film starts filming. Eon Productions has been officially mum on all of this, and it’s possible that Barbara Broccoli plans on making four big announcements (the star, the director, the distributor, and the release date) all at once, at a big event sometime soon.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;JAKE GYLLENHAAL TO RETEAM WITH PRISONERS DIRECTOR FOR THE SONFrench Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is definitely on the rise, following acclaim for Prisoners and Sicario, and with both Story of Your Life and the Blade Runner sequel on the way in the next couple of years. Jake Gyllenhaal starred in two of Villeneuve’s films (Enemy and Prisoners), and this week, we learned that Gyllenhaal and Villeneuve are planning on working together a third time, as both&nbsp;are attached to an adaptation of the Jo Nesbo crime thriller The Son. Gyllenhaal will play a former high school wrestler who becomes a heroin junkie after landing in prison, where he learns hidden secrets about his police officer father’s untimely suicide and sets out to find the people responsible. It’s expected that Villeneuve will probably direct The Son after the Blade Runner sequel, which has been casting lately for a summer, 2016 film start,&nbsp;and which Fox has scheduled for October 6, 2017.2.&nbsp;DISNEY MAY YET ADD THE LITTLE MERMAID TO ITS LIVE ACTION FAIRY TALESThough Disney has enjoyed success in recent years adapting their animated films into live action, they hadn’t announced any plans to do so with The Little Mermaid, so Universal Pictures decided to do it instead.&nbsp;Sofia Coppola was previously attached to direct (newcomer Rebecca Thomas now has the job), Working Title is producing, and Chloe Grace Moretz is attached to star in the adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson’s original story (which is more of a “downer”). However, Disney’s The Jungle Book was such a success that it appears the studio is confident enough to&nbsp;proceed with their own live action The Little Mermaid after all. It should be noted that film&nbsp;is in its very “early stages,” and so unlike The Jungle Book, there’s still a very good chance that Disney’s The Little Mermaid&nbsp;will premiere after the one starring Chloe Grace Moretz.&nbsp; Disney’s future “live action fairy tales” include Pete’s Dragon (8/12/16), Beauty and the Beast (3/17/17), Cruella, Dumbo, The Jungle Book 2, Maleficent 2, Mulan, Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, and the Mary Poppins sequel.3.&nbsp;THE NIGHT HE (JOHN CARPENTER) CAME HOME… TO THE HALLOWEEN FRANCHISEThere have now been ten movies in the Halloween horror franchise, but its creator, John Carpenter only directed the first film (Carpenter did produce/write Halloween II and produce Halloween III: Season of the Witch), but he’s finally returning to the Halloween. John Carpenter will serve as executive producer and composer on the 11th Halloween film, which is described as a new reboot, following the two reboot films directed by Rob Zombie. The reboot will be a coproduction between Miramax, producer Malek Akkad, and Blumhouse Productions (the home to such horror franchises as Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and The Purge). Speaking about his return to the franchise, John Carpenter said, “Michael Myers is not a character. He is a force of nature. He is not a person. He is part supernatural, part human. He’s like the wind. He’s an evil wind. When you start straying away from that and you get into explaining, you’re lost. So hopefully we can guide it back in that direction.” As for who might direct the next Halloween, apparently both Mike Flanagan (Oculus, Ouija 2) and Adam Wingard (You’re Next, The Guest) are potentially in negotiations for the job, though which will land it is still unknown.4.&nbsp;(THE OTHER) MIKE MYERS JOINS MARGOT ROBBIE IN TERMINALSpeaking of Michael Myers, Mike Myers has seemingly retired from being a live action actor for quite a while now, having last appeared in a cameo in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds back in 2009. (In that time, Myers has also changed his look quite a bit, going with a full head of silver hair that makes him look like Steve Martin’s little brother). The former SNL star might be ready to raise his profile again, however, because he and Simon Pegg have both joined a new “noir thriller” called Terminal. Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad) was the first to sign on — she’ll play a woman who encounters two hit men (Max Irons and Dexter Fletcher). It’s not yet known who Myers and Pegg are playing, but it sounds likely that one of them (possibly Myers) is the mysterious man who hires the two hit men for a “suicidal” job.5. REBEL WILSON TO STAR IN NEW ROMANTIC COMEDYAnyone who has followed pop culture the last several years may have noticed that “meta” is very much in (you can browse the dozens of “meta” categories at TV Tropes for examples). For those unfamiliar with the word, “meta” in pop culture refers to a story or character that is at least partially self-aware (Deadpool, for example, is very “meta”). Such stories have been around since antiquity (the Greek chorus is also “meta”), but perhaps because of both social media and “binge watching,” it just seems even more prevalent these days. This week, we learned that Australian comedian/actress Rebel Wilson is now signed with New Line Cinema to star in romantic comedy that is, you guessed it, “meta.” The&nbsp;currently untitled comedy centers on a woman (Wilson) who wakes up one day to realize that she is living within a romantic comedy, undoubtedly with all of the tropes and conventions that one might expect. No director has been announced yet.Rotten Ideas of The Week4.&nbsp;DWAYNE JOHNSON TO STAR IN DIE-HARD-ISH SKYSCRAPER ACTION MOVIEIt’s getting to the point that you&nbsp;almost need a “Wiki” database to keep track of all of Dwayne Johnson’s potential projects. An incomplete list would include: Central Intelligence, Moana, Fast 8 (and probably 9 and 10, etc), Baywatch, Jumanji, Doc Savage, Shazam!, the third Journey movie, and the video game adaptation of Rampage. Well, here’s another to add to that list, because Johnson will reunite with his Central Intelligence director for an action movie called Skyscraper, which will be produced by Legendary Pictures. Described as “Die Hard in China,” Skyscraper will be set in China at one of the world’s tallest skyscrapers, where presumably there’s a lot of shooting and jumping and punching and such going on. The verdict is still out on Central Intelligence, but director Rawson Marshall Thurber’s last two films (The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and We’re the Millers) both earned Rotten Tomatometer scores.3. WILL FRUIT NINJA CUT UP A ROTTEN SCORE?Hollywood is still committed to making&nbsp;video game movies happen, even though the Tomatometer history of such films is hardly promising. Indeed, the highest Tomatometer score any video game adaptation has ever received was 44 percent&nbsp;for Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and even that was 16 percent shy of Fresh. Of course, Hollywood sometimes just likes making money regardless of Tomatometer scores (go figure!), and the recent box office success of Angry Birds suggests that (sometimes) that might even be feasible. That film was animated, but this week’s news is about a live action movie based on another “video game app franchise” —&nbsp;Fruit Ninja. That’s right, the game about ninjas who use their katanas to chop up, well, fruit is now in development as a potential movie. The Tetris movie trilogy just made the news last week, so… sure, why not. That still doesn’t make either a great idea, however.2. PREPARE THE LASAGNA: GARFIELD TO RETURN TO THE BIG SCREENYou can probably file this under “milestones few people will celebrate,” but June 16, 2016 will mark the 10th anniversary of Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties, the second of two Rotten (14 percent and 11 percent) animated/live action hybrid films starring the voice of Bill Murray as the classic orange comic strip cat. Well, maybe somebody did notice, because WB-based Alcon Entertainment has acquired the feature film rights to Garfield.&nbsp;Alcon’s plan is to produce a new series of animated movies starring Garfield (and friends). The comic strip’s creator, Jim Davis, is also on board as executive producer. Unlike the previous films, these new Garfield movies will be entirely animated, with no live action. Bill Murray is also not expected to return as the voice of Garfield.1.&nbsp;ARE YOU READY FOR AS MANY POWER RANGERS MOVIES AS THERE ARE RANGERS?It’s been obvious for a while now that Lionsgate is hungry for as many “franchises” as it can develop. Though it&nbsp;previously put a lot of investment in various YA franchises (including The Hunger Games, Divergent, and others), the box office returns for such films appear to be on the wane. Lionsgate is also trying to make Now You See Me a “thing,” but we’ve still yet to see if the sequel this summer will be another success. And then, there’s their Power Rangers movie, scheduled for March 24, 2017. This week, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer made the news when he sort of casually said this, “We are really, really excited about the Power Rangers movie. We could see doing five or six or seven.” Just nineteen words (and most of them very short, at that), but that’s enough for online film writers to spin into very lengthy pieces. It’s unclear what the hypothetical seven Power Rangers movies could be about, but one possibility is that the number “seven” correlates (roughly) to the number of colors represented by various incarnations of the Power Rangers. Yes, the first movie will feature Red, Blue, Pink, Yellow, and Black, but there have also been Green and White Power Rangers. There have also been rumors that this first movie might particularly focus on the adventures of the Red Power Ranger. If this turns out to be true, which color do fans think should be the focus of the second Power Rangers movie? And if Lionsgate wants to go past seven movies, which other colors do you think should get their own Power Rangers? Brown, perhaps?","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Rock, Golden, Holiday, potter, TV, The","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/27164507/James-Bond-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"big-names-floated-as-next-james-bond-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509194712501","title":"From Furiosa to Furious: Charlize Theron Joins Fast 8, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})From Furiosa to Furious: Charlize Theron Joins Fast 8, and More Movie NewsDave Bautista joins Blade Runner, Edge of Tomorrow gets a sequel, and Warner Bros. may scale down.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 8, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Fast 8, Speedy, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, and the sequels to both Blade Runner and Edge of Tomorrow.This Week’s Top StoryFROM FURIOSA TO FURIOUS: CHARLIZE THERON JOINS FAST 8This is a continuation of a story that was first reported in early February, but it wasn’t until this week that this big news was finally confirmed. After starring last year as Imperator Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron has signed on for another movie involving lots and lots of driving. Theron has signed on to play a new character in Fast 8 (4/4/17) as what is being described as the “new adversary” for Vin Diesel’s character Dominic Toretto and his friends.&nbsp; That was confirmed by the official Twitter for the franchise, saying “Our crew will face its greatest adversary in our next film. Welcome Charlize Theron to the Fast family. 4.14.17. #F8.” Fans of Game of Thrones will see another familiar (but new) face in Fast 8, because Norwegian actor Kristofer Hivju — who&nbsp;plays the red-haired wildling leader Tormund Giantsbane on GoT —&nbsp;has been cast as one of the lead henchmen in the film. That wasn’t the only Charlize Theron news this week, however, as she is also planning on an independent reunion project about “motherhood.”&nbsp; The untitled film&nbsp;would reunite Charlize Theron with the director (Jason Reitman) and screenwriter (Diablo Cody) of her 2011 film Young Adult (though it’s not necessarily, and proably isn’t, an actual sequel to Young Adult).Fresh Developments This Week1. DAVE BAUTISTA (AKA “DRAX”) JOINS THE BLADE RUNNER SEQUELOn Saturday, former WWE Champion Dave Bautista took to his Twitter account to post an image of himself looking at a foil origami unicorn, with the caption, “I can’t wait to share some really exciting news…” If it was intended as a subtle hint, many fans seemed to get the message almost immediately. That’s because in Ridley Scott’s 1982 science fiction classic Blade Runner, foil origami unicorns were the calling card of the character Gaff, as played by Edward James Olmos. Two days later, sure enough, it was confirmed that Dave Bautista had indeed been cast in an “important supporting role” in the sequel to Blade Runner. Bautista will join the returning Harrison Ford, as well as new cast members Ryan Gosling and Robin Wright. It’s not yet confirmed if Bautista’s character will indeed have a direct connection to Gaff, as the origami unicorn suggests. The Blade Runner sequel will be directed by Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Enemy, Prisoners), with Ridley Scott producing (while he himself will direct&nbsp;Alien: Covenant at around the same time). Warner Bros has scheduled the Blade Runner sequel for wide release on January 12, 2018 (which might be part of an awards-season-friendly platform release).2. COMMUNITY STAR JOEL MCHALE TO PLAY COMMUNITY STAR CHEVY CHASEIf you’re a fan of the (formerly) NBC comedy series Community (and possibly, even if you’re not), you may have heard the many anecdotal “behind the scenes” stories about the show’s production, and especially about original cast member Chevy Chase. (And if you’re not, try Googling “Chevy Chase Community Feud” or some variation of that). In lieu of that, just to get a (relevant) taste of it, you can read this account from costar Joel McHale about the time he and Chevy Chase almost got in a physical altercation. Now that it’s established that Chevy Chase’s relationship with Community, and Joel McHale, was “rocky”, here’s where we get to the punchline: Netflix has cast McHale to play Chase in their film about the early years of comedy magazine National Lampoon, the home to several future comedy stars. That film will be called A Futile and Stupid Gesture, and like other recent Netflix feature film productions, it may also receive a theatrical release. There was a lot of casting news for the project this week, including that of Will Forte and Domhnall Gleeson playing the film’s focus characters, National Lampoon co-founders Douglas Kenney and Henry Beard. Chevy Chase won’t be the only SNL member portrayed in the movie, as there will also be John Belushi (John Gemberline of Broad City), and Bill Murray (Jon Daly of Kroll Show). Rick Glassman (Undateable) will play future Ghostbusters star Harold Ramis, and Veep costar Matt Walsh will play the publishing executive, Matty Simmons, who encouraged the expansion of National Lampoon into movies (like Animal House and National Lampoon’s Vacation).&nbsp;A Futile and Stupid Gesture will be directed by David Wain, who previously worked with Netflix on the TV spinoff&nbsp;Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp.3.&nbsp;BENICIO DEL TORO TO STAR IN CUBAN MAFIA DRAMA THE CORPORATIONNow that economic relations between the United States and Cuba are starting to thaw from decades of Cold War policies, it is looking like this will lead to more films either about Cuba, or that would benefit from being filmed in Cuba (such as any film needing lots of old cars). Leonardo DiCaprio is on the front of this impending trend, with the news this week that his production company, Appian Way,&nbsp;is producing a film about the history of Cuba’s criminal underworld. The movie will be an adapation of the upcoming book The Corporation: An Epic Story of the Cuban American Underworld, by author T.J. English. Benicio del Toro is already attached to star in The Corporation as Jose Miguel Battle Sr, AKA “El Padrino,” the longtime leader of “The Corporation,” which, as the name suggests, was Cuba’s equivalent of Lucky Luciano’s The Commission.&nbsp;The Corporation will be adapted by screenwriter David Matthews, who currently works on HBO’s new drama Vinyl.4.&nbsp;EUGENIO DERBEZ CAST AS VOICE OF SPEEDY (GONZALES)As a good example of how slowly many film projects move through development, let’s start this one off by pointing you to the Weekly Ketchup from over six years ago, on February 26, 2010. As that week’s Rotten Idea, we covered the news that comedian George Lopez had signed with Warner Bros to star in an animated feature film about Speedy Gonzales. Fast-forwarding like… someone very fast, we now come to the year 2016, and Warner Bros is still planning on a Speedy Gonzales movie, but their new choice for the industrious little mouse’s voice might signal a change in their approach. Mexican TV actor, comedian, and director Eugenio Derbez has signed with Warner Bros to star in the animated feature which now has the shorter title of just Speedy. Explaining his enthusiasm about Speedy, Derbez said, “He was like a superhero to us, or maybe more like a revolutionario like Simon Bolivar or Pancho Villa. He watched out for the little people, but with a lot of bravado and a weakness for the ladies.” Matching some of what Derbez said, Speedy is reportedly being crafted to be a Robin Hood-style origin story and “heist caper” about a crafty and heroic super speedster who helps the poor mice of Mexico by stealing from the film’s animated equivalent of “the rich.” It’s not yet known if frequent Speedy-chaser, Sylvester the Cat, will also costar to try to stop Speedy from stealing the re-distribution of cheese to the masses.5.&nbsp;POSTER FOR KINGSMAN: THE GOLDEN CIRCLE TEASES SURPRISE RETURNIf you haven’t seen last year’s spy action movie Kingsman: The Secret Service, this story pretty much revolves around a huge spoiler for that film. Having said that, this story is about a spoiler being used for the sequel’s marketing, so by the time Kingsman: The Golden Circle comes out next summer, it might be that “everyone” will be spoiled, through cultural osmosis if nothing else. The movie’s young star, Taron Egerton, has revealed the first poster for the sequel, and it appears to indicate that the character played by Colin Firth will be back. That’s because the poster displays the text “Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated” under a pair of glasses with one lens shaded out (referencing a crucial scene in Kingsman: The Secret Service). Speaking of shocking character deaths, we also learned this week that Pedro Pascal, who played Oberyn Martel in S4 of Game of Thrones, has been cast as a character called “Jack Daniels.” (It’s been hinted for a while that the sequel will heavily feature references to whiskey and other liquors.) Matthew Vaughn is returning to direct Kingsman: The Golden Circle, and other new cast members include Halle Berry and Julianne Moore. 20th Century Fox has scheduled Kingsman: The Golden Circle for release on June 17, 2017.6.&nbsp;LIVE. DIE. REPEAT. GAINS LITERAL MEANING WITH THE EDGE OF TOMORROW SEQUELDespite earning over $370 million worldwide, some people perceived the 2014 science fiction action movie Edge of Tomorrow as a box office disappointment (which had much to do with it being more expensive than most Tom Cruise films). Indeed, within the scope of Cruise’s own filmography, Edge of Tomorrow is actually his seventh biggest worldwide box office hit (in between Mission: Impossible III and Minority Report). Some people also thought the title was generic, after it was changed from the original manga title of All You Need Is Kill, and the post-theatrical marketing also used the promotional quasi-title, Live. Die. Repeat. Although there is talk of Warner Bros scaling back some of its production (see below), one film the studio is continuing to develop is an Edge of Tomorrow sequel. We know that because two screenwriters have been hired to work on the film, and they are the team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse, whose most recent film was the Jesse Owens biopic Race. It was also confirmed this week that the Edge of Tomorrow sequel will be directed by Doug Liman, who also directed the first film, as well as Mena, the drug war drama that Tom Cruise will also star in (1/16/17). If this sequel films next, that will mean Doug Liman will have worked with Tom Cruise for three movies in a row.7. RYAN REYNOLDS TO STAR IN ROMANTIC DRAMA THE ROSIE PROJECTHere’s another example of the many ways films in development go through different transformations before actually getting produced (if they ever do).&nbsp;The Rosie Project is an adaptation of a book by Graeme Simsion which previously had both Jennifer Lawrence and director Richard Linklater attached. Now, they’re both gone, and Ryan Reynolds is circling to star in it. If he signs on, Reynolds would play a “socially inept genetics professor who comes up with a scientifically sound survey to find the perfect mate,” until he meets a woman named Rosie who goes against everything his theories suggested would be his ideal match. Sony Pictures is still searching for suitable replacements for Linklater and Lawrence.8.&nbsp;WILL FERRELL AND HIS ICE PACK TO ATTEMPT DRUNKEN TRIP TO THE NORTH POLEOh, true stories. You sometimes give us such ridiculous “actual” stories that writers of fictional stories can basically do anything. A recent issue of New York Times Magazine, for example, ran this story about a group of Minnesota friends in 1968 who, after a long night of heavy drinking, decided to plan a snowmobile trip to the North Pole. And someone, somewhere, read that and thought “Hey, that sounds like a Will Ferrell movie!” Two weeks later, here we are. Sony Pictures is teaming up with producer Will Ferrell on an adaptation of the true story, Ice Pack: An Insurance Salesman and a Doctor Walk Into a Bar, and End Up at the North Pole (which will probably be shortened down to just Ice Pack). The story was written by Guy Lawson, who also wrote the true story article that became the inspiration for the upcoming Jonah Hill/Miles Teller comedy War Dogs (8/19/16).Rotten Idea of The Week1. RUMOR OF THE WEEK: WARNER BROS MAY TAKE BAD LESSON AWAY FROM BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICEBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice had a very good first weekend (arguably because so many opening weekend tickets were already ordered before the reviews started rolling in). That was before the second weekend drop of 69 percent, and now Warner Bros appears to be working on damage control and strategies for the future (presuming “make better movies” is not as easy a remedy as it might sound). The not-yet-confirmed news that dominated the cycle this week was the notion that Warner Bros might be looking to produce fewer movies. This is described as being not just a reaction to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, but also the disappointing results for other recent releases, like Jupiter Ascending (26 percent on RT), Pan (26 percent), and In the Heart of the Sea (42 percent). If the rumors are true, Warner Bros may instead focus more on three main production paths: their continuing LEGO franchise, their DC Comics movies, and the Harry Potter spinoffs like Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (and the already planned sequels). We’re calling this not just a potentially “Rotten Idea,” but really, sort of a shame. Warner Bros has had some critical and box office flops, sure (what studio hasn’t?), but they are also a studio that has recently given us movies like Argo, Godzilla, Interstellar, American Sniper, Creed, and Mad Max: Fury Road. And all of those films might have possibly fallen outside those three pathways to production and release. And it might be that we’re already seeing news that supports this rumor/theory. For example, the news broke this week that Warner Bros has put their adaptation of the manga Death Note into turnaround, and the film from director Adam Wingard (You’re Next) has been picked up by Netflix, the new masters of picking up other studio’s castoffs and dusting them off.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"hist, 2021, game, Comic, Fall, Podcast, medical, indiana, HBO, talk","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/08165834/Charlize-Theron-Fast-Furios.jpg","slug":"from-furiosa-to-furious-charlize-theron-joins-fast-8-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509196286402","title":"Christopher Nolan To Direct WWII Epic Dunkirk, and More Hollywood Headlines","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Christopher Nolan To Direct WWII Epic Dunkirk, and More Hollywood HeadlinesEmma Stone in talks for Cruella, Guillermo Del Toro may remake Fantastic Voyage, and Aaron Sorkin announces his directorial debut.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 8, 2016 |  CommentsThe Weekly Ketchup is back after two special yearly editions, which means that this time around, we’re recapping 21 days of news from the world of film development. Most of Hollywood takes those weeks off from making big announcements, but ten big stories did generate headlines, starting in&nbsp;mid-December. Included in the mix this time around are news stories involving such film titles as Baywatch, Creed 2, Cruella, Fantastic Voyage, Ready Player One, and Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk.This Week’s Top StoryCHRISTOPHER NOLAN TO DIRECT WWII EPIC DUNKIRKWhile most of Hollywood was taking its annual 3-week holiday vacation, most of the news either involved Star Wars: The Force Awakens, or the obligatory annual wrap-up pieces&nbsp;(and their companion pieces). That sort of instituionalized news vacancy left a big hole for someone of an appropriate stature to make an announcement that would ensure it would be the big project people would be talking about. This year, that acclaimed personage was director Christopher Nolan, whose future has been a big question mark following the late 2014 release of Interstellar. Would Christopher Nolan deliver another science fiction film, perhaps, or maybe return to DC Comics for another superhero film (after directing three Batman/Dark Knight movies)? Warner Bros had already announced a July 21, 2017 release date for Nolan’s next film, but that only made the mystery more alluring. On December 28th, the news started to break. The answer ended up being pretty much the opposite of the predictable: Christopher Nolan’s next film as director will be called Dunkirk, and it will be a World War II action adventure movie about the 1940 Battle of Dunkirk. In that military action, British, Belgian, and French forces attempted to rescue and evacuate over 300,000 troops who were surrounded by German forces in the French city of Dunkirk. Nolan is expected to cast several unknowns (or near-unknowns) in the lead roles, with known actors taking supporting roles. Right now, three such actors who are in talks with Nolan are Tom Hardy (his Bane from The Dark Knight Rises), Kenneth Branagh, and Mark Rylance. Composer Hans Zimmer will also be working again with Nolan on Dunkirk when it invades theaters on July 21, 2017.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;APOLLO CREED MIGHT RETURN FOR&nbsp;CREED 2This is not really a spoiler for anyone who’s been following the Rocky franchise (since he died in Rocky 4, in 1985), but Rocky’s original opponent, Apollo Creed, has been gone for a really, really long time. The absence of Apollo Creed, as played in the earlier films by Carl Weathers, was obviously a key element in the drama of last year’s hit franchise spinoff, Creed. Now, as attention is turning towards a Creed sequel, Sylvester Stallone is revealing that he has an idea of how to bring Carl Weathers back. Stallone is comparing Creed 2 to The Godfather Part II, saying that the plan may be to have the story set partially in the past, so that Carl Weathers can return as Apollo Creed for one more movie. And Stallone himself will also be returning for at least that part of the film, as well. Right now, the biggest question is whether Creed 2 will be directed by Ryan Coogler, who is next expected to direct Marvel’s Black Panther.2. DOES EMMA STONE HATE DOGS ENOUGH TO BE CRUELLA?Much of the last 15 months or so of film development news has been dominated by Walt Disney Pictures’ continuing efforts to return to their classic films via live action adaptations and prequels.&nbsp; This has mostly involved new films being added to their lengthy list (which is now over 15 film projects), but what happens less frequently is any news about actual actors and actresses. That’s because that is a much more advanced level of film development. This week, the 101 Dalmatians prequel involving the young Cruella de Vil hit upon exactly that landmark en route to actual production. Walt Disney Pictures hopes to start filming Cruella later this year, and to get that started, the studio is now in early talks with Emma Stone to star as Cruella. There’s no director yet for Cruella, but the film is being written by Kelly Marcel, who worked with Disney on their Mary Poppins drama, Saving Mr. Banks.3. GUILLERMO DEL TORO TO DIRECT FANTASTIC VOYAGE REMAKEIn 1966, when the original Fantastic Voyage was released, the idea of microscopic vehicles performing surgery inside living people was strictly science fiction. We may not yet be able to shrink actual people and ships like in Fantastic Voyage, but modern medicine does now utilize tiny devices that are just on the verge of that sort of medical “adventure.” All of that is probably why 20th Century Fox has been trying to remake Fantastic Voyage for well over a decade now. The filmmakers who have tackled Fantastic Voyage during that time have included James Cameron (who did Avatar instead), Rolan Emmerich (who did 2012 instead), Paul Greengrass (who did Captain Phillips instead), and Shawn Levy (who directed The Internship instead). What 20th Century Fox needed to find was a director who is currently in the opposite situation; someone actively between projects. Enter Guillermo Del Toro, who until a few months ago had been expected to be filming his (now shelved) Pacific Rim sequel right around now. Although Del Toro has in his career been attached to many high-concept genre movies, Fantastic Voyage has the advantage of a long development cycle. It’s also something of a nice transition for a director formerly known for working with giant monsters in Pacific Rim and the Hellboy movies.4.&nbsp;BEN MENDELSOHN CAST AS MAIN VILLAIN IN SPIELBERG’S READY PLAYER ONEThough the Australian actor is in his late 40s, he has only in recent years begun to attract more prominent roles. Mendelsohn’s profile is definitely on the upswing, however, especially after this year landing one of the lead roles in the next Star Wars movie, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (12/16/16). Now, Ben Mendelsohn is in early talks to take one of the central roles in Steven Spielberg’s adaptation&nbsp;of the Ernest Cline novel Ready Player One. Set in a near future where a virtual reality world has become the focus of most people’s lives, the main story involves a VR treasure hunt with the prize being the inheritance of the entire corporate empire, ala Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Based on how the villain role is described, it appears that Ben Mendelsohn would be playing Nolan Sorrento, an executive who is seeking to cheat the competition to retain his power. The lead role of Wade hasn’t been cast yet, but we do know that the female lead, Art3mis, will be played by Olivia Cooke (Bates Motel). Warner Bros has scheduled Ready Player One for release on December 15, 2017.5.&nbsp;HOLLYWOOD RETURNS TO CUBA, STARTING WITH… FURIOUS 8?After a scouting trip conducted by director F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job, Straight Outta Compton), Universal Pictures is now moving forward with the paperwork to make film production history. If all goes according to plan, Universal’s Furious 8 will become the first major Hollywood production to film scenes in Cuba since President Barack Obama announced in 2014 his intentions to lift decades-long restrictions against the Marxist nation. Most of the filming of Furious 8 will be focused in the Atlanta, Georgia, area, but Cuba may also be joined by filming in Iceland and Russia. If Furious 8 does film in Cuba, it’s likely to result in a drastic automotive contrast, as most of the nation’s cars date back to the 1950s, and few new cars were imported into Cuba after the Cuban Revolution began in 1959. Universal Pictures has scheduled Furious 8 for release on April 14, 2017.6. AARON SORKIN TO MAKE DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH POKER DRAMA MOLLY’S GAMEAaron Sorkin first became famous for his run of successful TV dramas like Sports Night, The West Wing, and The Newsroom. Since 2007, however, Sorkin has also been turning in a series of critically hailed film screenplays, including Charlie Wilson’s War, The Social Network, Moneyball, and most recently, Steve Jobs. Aaron Sorkin is now poised to make another transition, as he is now signed to make his feature directorial debut.&nbsp;That film will be called Molly’s Game, and it will be based upon Molly Bloom’s memoir, which details how she went from being a former Olympic skiier to organizing a series of underground poker games for the Hollywood elite, including the likes of Ben Affleck, Tobey Maguire, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Aaron Sorkin is expected to start meeting with actresses about starring in Molly’s Game soon.7.&nbsp;SPORTS ILLUSTRATED MODEL KELLY ROHRBACH IS THE BAYWATCH MOVIE’S NEW C.J.(Photo by Jason Merritt / Getty Images)&nbsp;Hollywood doesn’t turn TV shows into movies quite as often as they did in the 1990s, but thanks to the success of 21 Jump Street, there are still some in the works. After years of development, Paramount Pictures’ movie reboot of Baywatch is now preparing to start filming soon. We’ve known for a while that the 2017 film will be directed by Seth Gordon&nbsp;(Horrible Bosses, Identity Thief), and three of the leads will be Zac Efron, Dwayne Johnson, and his San Andreas costar Alexandra Daddario. Well, this week, Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Kelly Rohrbach took to her Instagram account to announce that she has also joined the film. Johnson joined in the announcement, confirming that Rohrbach will be playing C.J. Parker, the role played on the original TV show by Pamela Anderson. These announcements included images of Rohrbach in the iconic red bikini associated with both Pamela Anderson’s character and the show in general.Rotten Ideas of The Week2.&nbsp;GWEN STEFANI LEADS NEW CAST JOINING TROLLS ANIMATED MUSICAL(Photo by Robin Marchant / Getty Images)&nbsp;We’re now less than a year away from the 11/4/16 release of Trolls, the DreamWorks Animation musical about the dolls made popular in the 1970s and 1980s. We’ve known for a while that the two leads will be voiced by Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick, but this week, DreamWorks and Fox announced more of the supporting cast. The various Trolls will also be voiced by No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stefani, James Corden (Into the Woods), Kunal Nayyar (TV’s The Big Bang Theory), comedians Russell Brand and Ron Funches, and the Swedish electropop duo Icona Pop. Trolls will be directed by Mike Mitchell (Shrek Forever After, Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked), who has not had great luck with his Tomatometer, which is why this is&nbsp;one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas.”1.&nbsp;MICHAEL BAY CONFIRMS PLANS TO DIRECT THE FIFTH TRANSFORMERS MOVIEOne of the highest profile news threads running through most of 2015 was talk of where the mega-successful Transformers film franchise would&nbsp;go next, which reportedly included plans for spinoffs and prequels in the future. A lingering question amidst all of that involved director Michael Bay, who remains the only director of any live-action Transformers movie. Would someone else direct the fifth movie? Well, this week, we learned the answer is no, because Michael Bay will indeed direct the fifth Transformers movie, and then after that, he will finally hand the franchise off to someone else. Paramount Pictures is expected to schedule the fifth Transformers movie for sometime in the summer of 2017. Mark Wahlberg is also expected to return for his second outing&nbsp;in the franchise.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Awards, Winter, best, Awards, Seed, psychological, Pride, on, Polls","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08162636/ChristopherNolanKetchup.jpg","slug":"christopher-nolan-to-direct-wwii-epic-dunkirk-and-more-hollywood-headlines"},{"id":"47509194729917","title":"Deadpool Sequel Is Already In the Works, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Deadpool Sequel Is Already In the Works, and More Movie NewsNew roles for Lupita Nyong'o, Charlize Theron, Johnny Depp, Amy Schumer, Emily Blunt, Idris Elba, and More.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 12, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Alien: Covenant, Deadpool 2, Fast 8, The Invisible Man, and My Little Pony.This Week’s Top StoryDEADPOOL SEQUEL ALREADY IN THE WORKSDeadpool has only been in theatrical release for less than 24 hours as of this writing, but box office reports are already coming in indicating that the R-rated superhero movie is breaking records, and may continue to do so.&nbsp;Deadpool is also a critical success, Certified Fresh on RT with a score of 84 percent&nbsp;(again, as of this writing). All of this adds up to a validation for star Ryan Reynolds and screenwriters/producers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who have been championing exactly this sort of Deadpool movie for over ten years now. To their credit, 20th Century Fox appears to have quickly learned to listen to the Deadpool team, because the studio has already set all three to start work on a Deadpool sequel. It’s not yet known what the sequel might entail, such as, for example, whether Deadpool, the Merc with a Mouth, might actually do some mercenary work in it (the first Deadpool being more about revenge, plot-wise). One possibility is that Deadpool might meet his frequent comic book partner, Cable, who has yet to make his cinematic debut. Cable is also the frequent leader of the X-Force team, and Ryan Reynolds has already started talking about his interest in seeing Deadpool being joined by X-Force on the big screen. To some extent, this is not 100 percent “new” news, as we’ve already heard in the last few years that 20th Century Fox wants to have X-related spinoffs for teams like X-Force and The New Mutants, but the success of Deadpool may make the exact road to an X-Force movie a more obvious path. Some of the other X-Force members, like Cable, who have not yet prominently appeared in movies include Cannonball, Domino, Meltdown/Boom-Boom, Shatterstar, Wolfsbane, and X-23.Fresh Developments This Week1. LUPITA NYONG’O MAY COSTAR IN INTELLIGENT LIFE FOR DIRECTOR AVA DUVERNAY(Photo by Victor Chavez / Getty Images)&nbsp;Following the box office and critical success last year of Selma, there has been much curiosity about what sort of film director Ava DuVernay would take on next. For a while, there was talk of her working with Marvel on Black Panther, but that job has gone to Creed director Ryan Coogler instead. This week, we learned of two different genre projects that have been offered to Ava DuVernay. One of them is Walt Disney Pictures’ adaptation of the Madeleine L’Engle children’s fantasy novel A Wrinkle in Time (which is also the first of a series of books that also could be adapted into future films). That project may need more time in development, which might be why it’s the other film in this week’s news which might get produced first. That film is called Intelligent Life, and it’s a science fiction thriller being produced by Steven Spielberg, based upon a script cowritten by Jurassic World director Colin Treverrow. Formerly called The Ambassador, Intelligent Life reportedly follows a government worker in a department assigned with communicating with alien life who falls in love with a mysterious woman who turns out to be an alien herself. Lupita Nyong’o, who played the CGI alien Maz Khanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, is now in talks with Amblin Entertainment to play that alien romantic interest. It’s not yet known who Ava DuVernay (if she does sign on to direct) might cast as the film’s male human lead. Filming of Intelligent Life is expected to start this coming summer.2. KATE WINSLET AND KEIRA KNIGHTLEY JOIN COLLATERAL BEAUTYWill Smith’s football drama Concussion may have been a relative non-starter in this year’s awards season, but it’s looking more and more like another such film is being lined up for the next one.&nbsp; For one thing, Warner Bros and New Line Cinema have scheduled Smith’s drama Collateral Beauty for December 16, 2016, going up against Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.&nbsp;With this move, Collateral Beauty is replacing WB’s Steven Spielberg-directed adaptation of the popular novel Ready Player One, which is now scheduled for March 30, 2018. The film’s cast is also growing increasingly awards-friendly, though in something of a thematic hiccup, the newest cast members are predominantly white. Keira Knightley and Kate Winslet are both in talks to join a cast that includes Helen Mirren, Edward Norton, Michael Pena, and Naomie Harris. Will Smith will star in Collateral Beauty as an advertising executive who experiences depression following a personal tragedy, inspiring his coworkers to try to cheer him up. Some of the supporting cast members will represent abstract concepts, with Keira Knightley representing “Love,” for example. Kate Winslet is in talks to replace Rachel McAdams, who had previously been attached, and indeed, Will Smith himself replaced Hugh Jackman in this film’s meandering road to production.&nbsp;Collateral Beauty will be directed by David Frankel (Marley &amp; Me, The Devil Wears Prada).3.&nbsp;IDRIS ELBA TO REPLACE PACIFIC RIM COSTAR CHARLIE HUNNAM IN NEW DRAMAThere is no way of telling how long this will last, but already, only a few weeks after the #OscarsSoWhite meme took off again this year, we are continuing to see casting choices changing. One such example is the airplane crash survival drama The Mountains Between Us, which previously had English thespians Charlie Hunnam (TV’s Sons of Anarchy) and Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) attached to star. Now, 20th Century Fox has instead begun talks with Hunnam’s Pacific Rim costar Idris Elba to star as a physician and mountain climbing enthusiast who uses his skills to save himself and a female writer with a broken leg. It’s not yet known if Rosamund Pike will remain cast as the writer, or if that role will also be recast.&nbsp;The Mountains Between Us will be directed by Hany Abu-Assad (Paradise Now), and is an adaptation of the novel by Charles Martin.4.&nbsp;AMY SCHUMER TURNS INSIDE WITH PTSD DRAMA PROJECT, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICEAmy Schumer only made her debut as a feature film leading lady last summer with Trainwreck, but already the award-winning comedienne and actress&nbsp;is moving towards transitioning into dramatic roles. Schumer has joined the ensemble cast of Thank You For Your Service, the Iraq war drama about PTSD that Steven Spielberg had at one time been considering directing. Instead, American Sniper screenwriter Jason Hall will be making his directorial debut. Amy Schumer joins a cast which includes Miles Teller (as the film’s lead), Keisha Castle-Hughes (Whale Rider), Haley Bennett, Brad Beyer, Joe Cole, Omar Dorsey, Scott Haze, Beulah Koale, and Jayson Warner-Smith. We also learned this week that Goldie Hawn will be playing Amy Schumer’s mother in the untitled mother-daughter comedy that Schumer has been developing for a while. It’s expected that this “mother-daughter comedy” with Hawn is a separate comedy than the “sisters comedy” Schumer is cowriting with Jennifer Lawrence.5.&nbsp;CALLING IT NOW: DANNY MCBRIDE (LIKELY) TO GET FACEHUGGED IN ALIEN: COVENANTAs the extended Alien franchise prepares to move onto its 8th film, there is by this point a quite extensive roster of actors who have appeared in one of the films. That eclectic group includes Sir John Hurt and Yaphet Kotto (Alien), Bill Paxton and Paul Reiser (Aliens), Charles S. Dutton (Alien 3), Dan Hedaya and Winona Ryder (Alien: Resurrection), and Idris Elba and Charlize Theron (Prometheus), (and that’s without even getting into the two AvP movies). If Ridley Scott’s next film Alien: Covenant, is to Prometheus what Aliens was to Alien, we may have heard this week what actor might be the Covenant counterpart to Bill Paxton’s Private Hudson. (Or this week’s news might be about a completely different sort of character, and this speculation will be amusing to future readers.) That’s because Danny McBride (This is the End, HBO’s Eastbound &amp; Down) is now in talks to join Katherine Waterston and Michael Fassbender in Alien: Covenant. The film reportedly has two comedic “techie” characters, but it’s unconfirmed that Danny McBride will play one of them. 20th Cenury Fox has scheduled Alien: Covenant for release on October 6th, 2017, which is very similar to the 10/2/15 release date of Ridley Scott’s most recent film, The Martian.6.&nbsp;CHARLIZE THERON WANTED FOR VILLAIN ROLE IN FAST 8It’s now been almost 13 years since Charlize Theron costarred in the 2003 remake of The Italian Job, but with the success of last year’s Mad Max: Fury Road, it appears that Theron will once again regularly have car-themed action movies on her agenda. That’s because the writers of Fast 8 are reportedly developing the film around having one main villain, a woman, and the producers of the Fast and Furious franchise hope that they can recruit Charlize Theron for the role. With the recent news that Fast 8 will be followed by two more films, it’s possible that Theron’s character will continue on in future films, similar to how Dwayne Johnson is now a franchise member.&nbsp;Fast 8 is scheduled for April 4, 2017, and it will be followed by the 9th film on 4/19/19 and the 10th (and possibly final) film on 4/2/21.7. EMILY BLUNT TO VOICE NEW CHARACTER IN MY LITTLE PONYThis week, we learned a bit more and Lionsgate’s big screen plans for the My Little Pony movie (scheduled for 11/3/17). Most of this comes via the announcement that Emily Blunt will voice a new character in My Little Pony. Emily Blunt is joining Kristen Chenoweth (Wicked, TV’s Pushing Daisies), who will also be voicing a new character created for this animated feature film. Blunt and Chenoweth are joining the voice cast of the TV series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, with that show’s “Mane 6” all reprising their voice cast roles. Those actresses are Ashleigh Ball (Applejack and Rainbow Dash), Tabitha St. Germain (Rarity), Andrea Libman (Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie), and frequent video game actress Tara Strong (Twilight Sparkle), and with Cathy Weseluck as Spike the Dragon. The My Little Pony movie is being directed by Jayson Thiessen, who has directed most of the episodes of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.Rotten Ideas of The Week2.&nbsp;DOES JOHNNY DEPP LOOK LIKE HE SHOULD STAR IN THE INVISIBLE MAN?We’ve known for a while that Universal Pictures wants to make a new “cinematic universe” out of reboots of their various classic monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, etc.). And it has become increasingly obvious in recent months that the studio hopes to do that using major Hollywood stars like Tom Cruise in The Mummy and (the not yet signed) Angelina Jolie as their Bride of Frankenstein. Even so, it seemed like it wasn’t until this week that film writers and bloggers really woke up to what Universal is hoping to do, which is probably to end up with some sort of movie monster version of Ocean’s Eleven. That’s because Universal Pictures has successfully signed Johnny Depp to star in their reboot of H.G. Wells’ The Invisible Man. Of course, as the title suggests, even if Depp does sign on, the role may end up being largely a “voice role,” since not being able to see The Invisible Man is sort of the point (although many movies about “Invisible Men” have found ways around that in the past). It’s not yet known when exactly Universal Pictures might actually produce The Invisible Man, with one possibility being that Depp might debut in an earlier “Universal Monsters” movie before getting his own film.&nbsp;The Invisible Man is reportedly being adapted by screenwriter Ed Solomon, whose credits also include Now You See Me (another film about deceiving the eyes), Charlie’s Angels, Men in Black, and Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;We’re calling this one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based on Johnny Depp’s decidedly spotty record when it comes to high concept fantasy/genre roles.1.&nbsp;TRANSFORMERS TO BECOME AN ANNUAL FRANCHISE STARTING WITH 2017With a number of franchises increasing their film output to at least an average of one film a year (Marvel, Star Wars, X-Men, WB/DC), it’s appearing that this will be a model that more and more studios will begin to follow. The latest example of this is Paramount Pictures’ Transformers, with the news this week that the studio is reserving June dates starting next summer. Paramount Pictures has scheduled the 5th Transformers film (to be directed by Michael Bay) for June 23rd, 2017. The 6th and 7th movies will follow on June 8th, 2018 and June 28, 2019. The news also broke today that the 6th movie is expected to be a solo spinoff movie focusing on Bumblebee. By selecting these dates, Paramount is putting their Transfomers movies up against Wonder Woman (2017), Godzilla 2 (2018), and by one week, The Incredibles 2 (6/21/19). The promise/threat of having a Transformers movie every year is a Rotten Idea, based on the Tomatometer scores for the last three films, two of which were in the 18-19 percent Rotten range.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"reboot, comics, theme, Poppins, Martial, adventure, Movies, child's, spanish","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12163505/Deadpool2.jpg","slug":"deadpool-sequel-is-already-in-the-works-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509194725819","title":"The Pacific Rim Sequel Moves Forward Without Guillermo Del Toro, and Other Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Pacific Rim Sequel Moves Forward Without Guillermo Del Toro, and Other Movie NewsNew roles for J.K. Simmons, Jennifer Aniston, Ryan Reynolds, Michael B. Jordan, and It's A Small World is still happening.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 26, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Alien: Covenant, Mary Poppins 2, Pacific Rim 2, and Ready Player One.This Week’s Top StoryTHE GIANT ROBOTS AND MONSTERS OF PACIFIC RIM WILL RETURN AFTER ALLLast year, when the news broke that the Guillermo Del Toro-directed sequel to Pacific Rim had been removed from Universal Pictures’ release schedule, many perceived that as a sign the sequel would never happen. That move seemed surprising when one considers that Pacific Rim earned over $411 million in global box office, including $111 million in China alone. This week, we learned that the sequel to Pacific Rim is indeed moving forward (just not with Guillermo Del Toro as director). Instead, Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures have hired director Steven S. DeKnight to direct the Pacific Rim sequel, which will be his feature film debut. Previously, Steven S. DeKnight has worked mostly in television, including Spartacus, Smalllville, and Netflix’s Daredevil, on which he is the executive producer and showrunner. Guillermo Del Toro will remain involved with the Pacific Rim as one of the film’s producers. Steven S. DeKnight will be working from a script written by Jon Spaihts, who also cowrote Prometheus, and has such films as the reboots of Van Helsing and The Mummy (both also for Universal Pictures) in development, and Marvel’s Doctor Strange and the Jennifer Lawrence/Chris Pratt sci-fi romance Passengers in production.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;J.K. SIMMONS TO PORTRAY REAL LIFE BOSTON BOMBING HERO IN PATRIOTS DAYUntil a few months ago, there had been a race to produce the first prestige film based upon the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. That changed in November, however, when the producers of one (Patriots Day) acquired the rights to the other (Boston Strong), which led to them being combined into a single film. In the process, Mark Wahlberg, who would have played Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, instead transitioned to playing Boston Police Detective Danny Keeler. That focus on street level “real police” was emphasized this week with the news that J.K. Simmons has been cast as Watertown Police Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese. As you can read here, Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese was an off-duty police officer who rushed into personal combat with both Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his brother Dzhokar Tsarnaev, in a sequence that literally reads like something from a “Hollywood movie.” Although he has appeared in such films as the first three Spider-Man movies, J.K. Simmons’ roles are usually more dramatic in nature, so Patriots Day will be something of a departure, involving active extended participation in multiple “action scenes.”&nbsp;Patriots Day will be directed by Peter Berg (The Rundown, Lone Survivor) from a script by Bridge of Spies cowriter Matt Charman, and it&nbsp;will start filming in Boston in March, under production by both CBS Films and their corporate cousin, 60 Minutes Productions.2.&nbsp;TYE SHERIDAN LANDS LEAD IN SPIELBERG’S AMBITIOUS SCI-FI READY PLAYER ONEWe have heard in recent weeks/months about casting for roles in Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Ready Player One, but it wasn’t until Wednesday that we knew who would actually be the film’s lead. Now, we know that the future pop culture enthusiast Wade Watts will be played by Tye Sheridan. At just 19, Sheridan is quite close to Watts’ age (high school), which is unusual for most Hollywood movies. His previous roles include prominent parts in The Tree of Life, Mud, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse, and he will also costar as the young Cyclops in X-Men: Apocalypse. Sheridan joins the previously cast Olivia Cooke (as Art3mis) and Ben Mendelsohn as the corporate villain Nolan Sorrento. Warner Bros has scheduled Ready Player One for March 30, 2018 (which is a new date, recently moved back three months after Star Wars Episode VIII took its previous release date of December 15, 2017).3. HAMILTON STAR JOINS MARY POPPINS SEQUEL (IN BERT-ISH ROLE)We may not yet have movie adaptations of the Broadway musical hits In the Heights and last year’s Hamilton, but the creator of both is at least making the transition himself. That’s because Lin-Manuel Miranda (who also stars in Hamilton) is now in talks with Walt Disney Pictures to join their planned sequel to their 1964 musical Mary Poppins. Miranda would join Emily Blunt (as the title character) as a lamplighter in London, in a role that is expected to be a Depression Era (1930s) analog to Bert, the chimneysweep character played in the first film by Dick Van Dyke. It’s not yet known if another actor will be cast as Bert in this sequel (Dick Van Dyke is himself obviously too old, at the age of 90, to reprise the role in the new film, which is set only 20 years later). The first Mary Poppins movie was based on the first book by P.L. Travers, and this sequel will be based upon later books in Travers’ series, as the titular nanny returns to help the now-grown-up Banks children deal with their own children. This Mary Poppins sequel will also be a musical, and will be directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago, Nine, Into the Woods). Lin-Manuel Miranda is also working with Disney on the music for this year’s Polynesian fantasy animated adventure Moana.4.&nbsp;BILLY CRUDUP AND DEMIAN BICHIR JOIN RIDLEY SCOTT’S ALIEN: COVENANTJust a few days before his latest film, The Martian, vies for Oscar gold as a Best Picture nominee, director Ridley Scott is continuing to attract an impressive cast for his Prometheus sequel, Alien: Covenant. The first actor to make such news this week was Demian Bichir, who is coming off working with Quentin Tarantino as one of The Hateful Eight. Bichir was joined three days later by Billy Crudup, who&nbsp;also recently joined the cast of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis biopic Jackie&nbsp;in an unknown role. Natalie Portman is starring as the former First Lady in that film, which will also feature Peter Sarsgaard (as Robert Kennedy) and Greta Gerwig. 20th Century Fox has scheduled Alien: Covenant for release on October 6, 2017, up against Warner Bros’ Jungle Book: Origins.5. JENNIFER ANISTON AND DEADPOOL‘S T.J. MILLER TO CELEBRATE OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTYAs one would expect, there continues to be good news for those involved with this year’s first and biggest surprise box office hit, Deadpool. That includes T.J. Miller, who played Weasel, the bartender whose establishment (in the movie, at least) gave the title character his nom du anti-hero. This week, we learned that Miller and Jennifer Aniston&nbsp;are both attached to star&nbsp;for DreamWorks in their comedy Office Christmas Party. They will also be joined by Jason Bateman (Netflix’s Arrested Development) and Kate McKinnon (SNL, Ghostbusters). The movie will have to be filmed very quickly, as Paramount Pictures has already scheduled Office Christmas Party for release on December 9, 2016, just over nine months from the time of this writing, with filming not yet having started.&nbsp;Office Christmas Party will be directed by the team of Will Speck and Josh Gordon, whose previous feature films were Blades of Glory (69 percent Fresh) and The Switch (51 percent Rotten). Aniston and Bateman&nbsp;were also the leads in The Switch&nbsp;and previously worked together on the two Horrible Bosses movies.6.&nbsp;DAVID CRONENBERG’S RABID TO GET REMADE BY DEAD HOOKER IN A TRUNK TEAMLong before he became the arthouse director of dramas like Eastern Promises, A History of Violence, and Cosmopolis, Canadian director David Cronenberg was the leading proponent of the “body horror” genre. There was some level of body horror in most of Cronenberg’s early films, including Shivers, The Brood, Scanners, Videodrome, Naked Lunch, and his remake of The Fly. Audience reception of gore and blood has advanced to the degree that most of Cronenberg’s films could now be perceived as relatively tame. Considering that climate, it’s probably not surprising that producers are now turning to remaking Cronenberg’s films. This week, the directing team of Jen and Sylvia Soska (who are also twin sisters) came aboard to direct a remake of David Cronenberg’s 1977 film Rabid. In the original, porn star Marilyn Chambers played a woman with a stinger in her armpit that she used to feed on victims vampirically (like we said, “body horror”), spreading the condition like a zombie virus. The Soska Sisters have built their careers on blood and gore, with their previous films being Dead Hooker in a Trunk, and 2013’s American Mary. Perhaps not that coincidentally, the Soska Sisters being identical twins might also make them good choices for any future efforts to remake Cronenberg’s Dead Ringers, which was itself about a pair of identical twins.Rotten Ideas of The Week3.&nbsp;THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR TO GET YET ANOTHER REMAKE, THIS TIME WITH MICHAEL B. JORDANThe year 2015 was very “rebooty” for actor Michael B. Jordan, as he starred in both Fantastic Four&nbsp;and the Rocky spinoff Creed (which was essentially an in-story reboot of the franchise, with a new boxing character lead). Instead of using his new critical and box office clout to seek out more original material, Jordan instead this week attached himself to another reboot, this one a direct remake, by reuniting with MGM (the studio behind Creed and the Rocky franchise) for&nbsp;a new remake of the heist movie The Thomas Crown Affair. The original movie was released in 1968 and&nbsp;featured Steve McQueen, Faye Dunaway, and the heavy use of “split screen narrative” (as a way of showing simultaneous events at the same time). Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo then starred in the first remake&nbsp;of The Thomas Crown Affair in 1999. Both films were romantic heist thrillers, with the first movie being about a bank robber, and the second film being about an art thief. The seed for this third movie reportedly came from Michael B. Jordan himself, who pitched the idea to MGM executives&nbsp;looking&nbsp;for another film to produce with Jordan. As such, there are not currently any screenwriters or directors attached to this third version of The Thomas Crown Affair.2.&nbsp;RYAN REYNOLDS’ FIRST POST-DEADPOOL ROLE WILL BE AS THE HITMAN’S BODYGUARDAs to be expected, right about now is a good time to be associated with Deadpool (see the T.J. Miller story up above), and the most obvious beneficiary of that film’s success is Ryan Reynolds. This week, we learned that the action movie The Hitman’s Bodyguard (which Reynolds had previously already been attached to) will be his first new role in production following the success of Deadpool. In addition to the also-previously cast Gary Oldman and Samuel L. Jackson, Ryan Reynolds will also be joined by Salma Hayek and Elodie Yung. That means that 60 percent of the five stars will have Marvel connections, as Deadpool is joined by Nick Fury (Jackson) and Netflix’s Elektra (Yung, in next month’s season two of Daredevil). Reynolds will star in The Hitman’s Bodyguard, as, well, a bodyguard for a hitman played by Samuel L. Jackson, as the pair race to get to The Hague before an Eastern European dictator, played by Gary Oldman.&nbsp;The Hitman’s Bodyguard will be directed by Jeff Wadlow (Kick-Ass 2, Never Back Down), who is also rumored to possibly be developing the X-Force super team spinoff (from both X-Men and Deadpool) for 20th Century Fox. Of the three feature films on Wadlow’s Tomatometer, none of them have scored above 30 percent (22 percent for Cry Wolf and Never Back Down, 30 percent for Kick-Ass 2).&nbsp; Millennium Films will begin production on The Hitman’s Bodyguard in April, and Lionsgate will distribute the film, probably in 2017.1.&nbsp;DISNEY THEME PARK ATTRACTION IT’S A SMALL WORLD GROWSWe’ve known since early 2014 that Walt Disney Pictures is developing a live-action adaptation of their theme park attraction It’s a Small World. But since then, that project hasn’t made the news, so one could have guessed that Disney had set it aside. This week, however, we learned that Disney is indeed still working on getting this one adapted and in theaters. Walt Disney Pictures has hired the screenwriting team of Tim Rasmussen and Vince Di Meglio to start working on It’s a Small World. Rasmussen and Di Meglio previously adapted the comic strip Marmaduke (9 percent Rotten) and cowrote the Robin Williams comedy License to Wed (7 percent Rotten). Director Jon Turteltaub remains attached to It’s a Small World. His filmography for the last 20 years is 100 percent Rotten, including Phenomenon (50 percent), Disney’s The Kid (49 percent), National Treasure (44 percent), The Sorcerer’s Apprentice (41 percent), and Last Vegas (46 percent).&nbsp;It’s a Small World, the attraction itself, doesn’t have an existing narrative, but is instead just a series of international cultures as represented by their architecture, traditional clothing, and little figures and scenes.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"space, remakes, Sematary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/26161201/PacificRim2Ketchup.jpg","slug":"the-pacific-rim-sequel-moves-forward-without-guillermo-del-toro-and-other-movie-news"},{"id":"47509194734015","title":"The Birth of a Nation Sets A Sundance Record, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Birth of a Nation Sets A Sundance Record, and More Movie NewsNew projects for Kathryn Bigelow, Jennifer Aniston, and Natalie Dormer. Also, Joseph Fiennes will play Michael Jackson.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 29, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development. Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as NickToons, a new Labyrinth, and new films for stars Jennifer Aniston, Rebecca Ferguson, Harrison Ford, and Zhang Ziyi.This Week’s Top StoryTHE BIRTH OF A NATION SETS SUNDANCE RECORDWhen the Academy Awards nominations were announced two weeks ago, the 20-out-of-20 showing of exclusively white actors sparked online outrage and calls for change, both for the Academy Awards and in Hollywood in a larger sense. Last Friday, the Academy did indeed reveal new membership changes which followed a pledge to double the number of women and minority members of the AMPAS by 2020. If the Academy Awards are going to be increasing the number of minority actors that receive nominations, they are also going to need quality films featuring minority actors to nominate and vote for. So, it probably shouldn’t be surprising that at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, the biggest story involved just such a&nbsp;film. In a record setting deal ($17.5 million), Fox Searchlight has acquired the rights to the controversially-titled* slave rebellion biopic The Birth of a Nation. (*The Birth of a Nation was&nbsp;also the title of the 1915 D.W. Griffith film about the founding of the Ku Klux Klan).&nbsp;Nate Parker produced, directed, wrote, and stars in The Birth of a Nation as Nat Turner, the slave who led a rebellion in Virginia in 1831. Even though Fox Searchlight set a record with their $17.5 million winning bid, they actually were not the highest bidders, as both Netflix and producer Byron Allen reportedly submitted larger bids of $20 million each.&nbsp; Nate Parker is joined in The Birth of a Nation by a cast that includes Aunjanue Ellis, Jackie Earle Haley, Armie Hammer, Roger Guenveur Smith, and Gabrielle Union.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;DIRECTOR KATHRYN BIGELOW TO TAKE ON 1967 DETROIT RIOTS FOR 50TH ANNIVERSARY NEXT YEARDirector Kathryn Bigelow made her debut in 1981 (The Loveless) and built a fanbase with Near Dark and Point Break. In 2008, however, Bigelow’s career found new life and awards-friendly clout with The Hurt Locker, which was followed in 2012 by the hunt-for-bin-Laden drama Zero Dark Thirty. Both of those last two films were collaborations with screenwriter Mark Boal. After a few other false starts (such as with the South American crime film Triple Frontier), it appears that Bigelow’s next film will be her third collaboration Boal. If everything goes as planned, Kathryn Bigelow’s tenth film as director will be an untitled drama about the five days in the summer of 1967 now known as the 1967 Detroit Riot. The plan is for the project to start filming in the next several months so that the eventual film can be released next summer, in time for the event’s 50th anniversary. There are still a lot of “ifs” to fill in for that to happen, such as a studio and cast, but Bigelow has proven to be capable of bringing a film together quickly in the past (Zero Dark Thirty is actually something of a textbook example of a filmmaker doing that). The story of the 1967 Detroit Riots is very much an African American story, so in the aftermath of #OscarsSoWhite (and indirectly, the recent Flint water tragedy as well), are Bigelow and Boal primed to tap directly into the zeitgeist?2.&nbsp;SPIDER-MAN DIRECTOR SAM RAIMI TO REMAKE FRENCH PRISON FILM A PROPHETOne of the biggest film development stories of early 2010 was the departure of director Sam Raimi from what would have his fourth Spider-Man film with Tobey Maguire. Six years later, whatever bad blood that rift may have left between Sam Raimi and Sony Pictures appears to have been healed, because the director and that studio are now in talks to reunite on a new film project. Raimi is now in talks with Sony Pictures to direct their English language adaptation of the 2009 French film Un Prophete, known in English as A Prophet. That film told the story of a 19 year old Algerian-French prison inmate who plays the odds between two prominent prison factions: the Muslims and the Corsicans. It’s extremely likely (ie, almost 100% certain) that at least one of the groups (the Corsicans) will be changed for this film to something more common in American prisons. The original film A Prophet received an impressive array of awards and distinctions, including the Grand Prix Award at the Cannes Film Festival, 13 nominations (which set a record) and 9 wins at the Cesar Awards, an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, and a Certified Fresh 97 percent Tomatometer score. Sam Raimi reportedly hopes to start filming this remake by this summer, so if these plans remain concrete, we should start hearing casting reports over the next few months.3.&nbsp;JENNIFER ANISTON TO STAR IN SPORTS AGENT TRUE STORY THE FIXERAlthough her roles in The Good Girl, Cake, and (obviously) Friends have earned her many nominations and awards, recognition by the Academy Awards have thus far eluded Jennifer Aniston.&nbsp; This early on (ie, casting news), it’s nearly self-defeating to try to guess which roles might have a shot, but her chance may be coming.&nbsp;That’s because Aniston is now attached to star in the Fox 2000 drama The Fixer, based on a Men’s Journal article about sports agent Denise White. Denise White is a former Miss Oregon USA who went on to become a sports agent&nbsp;and run&nbsp;her own agency (EAG Sports Management).&nbsp;The Fixer began its film development life as a pitch from screenwriter Melisa Wallack, who also cowrote Dallas Buyers Club, for which she was nominated for a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. Fox 2000 has not yet attached a director for The Fixer.4. WILL REBECCA FERGUSON FIND LIFE FROM MARS? (IT’S THE FREAKIEST SHOW…)2015 was quite a breakout year for Swedish actress Alicia Vikander, but singling out her success comes at the price of forgetting that 2015 was also a great year for another young actress. Last year also saw the release of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which for many people was their first exposure to Rebecca Ferguson, who is also Swedish. Since that film’s success in July/August, Ferguson has been the focus of several casting stories, as she was&nbsp;confirmed to be costarring or starring in at least The Girl on the Train, Florence Foster Jenkins, and The Snowman (based on the novel by Norwegian author Jo Nesbo). Ferguson landed another role this week with the news that she is signed to star in a film called Life.&nbsp;Life, which appears to be science fiction based on its premise, will focus on the crew of the International Space Station, who recover a sample from Mars that reveals “signs of life, and proves to be more intelligent than expected.”&nbsp;Life will be directed by Daniel Espinosa, whose filmography includes the Denzel Washington film Safe House, and last year’s Tom Hardy film Child 44.&nbsp; Although Espinosa’s filmography is currently only 1/3 Fresh, we’re giving this borderline story a “Fresh Development” nudge due to the involvement of Rebecca Ferguson.Rotten Ideas of The Week5.&nbsp;NATALIE DORMER KNOWS ALL ABOUT&nbsp;OFFICIAL SECRETSThe two wars that the United States engaged in during the previous decade (and this one, too) continue to inspire new films. One such project is called Official Secrets, although it is an adaptation of a non-fiction book more lengthily and precisely titled The Spy Who Tried to Stop a War: Katherine Gun and the Secret Plot to Sanction the Iraq Invasion. This week, we learned that the film will feature five stars whose credits include Star Wars, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor, The Hobbit, and HBO’s Game of Thrones.&nbsp;Specifically, we’re talking about Harrison Ford, Paul Bettany (Marvel’s Vision), Sir Anthony Hopkins (Marvel’s Thor), Martin Freeman (Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit films), and Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell on Game of Thrones). Natalie Dormer will star as Katharine Gun, a young British intelligence officer who reveals a secret NSA operation intended to spark a war in Iraq. Bettany and Freeman will play figures at the British newspaper The Observer, Hopkins will play a British general, and Harrison Ford will play a CIA agent.&nbsp;Official Secrets will be directed by Justin Chadwick, whose filmography to date has been three films with Rotten Tomatometer scores, which is why we’re calling this one a “Rotten Idea,” despite the impressive cast which has all worked on films with excellent Tomatometer scores. The production of Official Secrets will need to be done with Harrison Ford by this summer, as we also learned this week that filming of Blade Runner 2 (which will feature Harrison Ford again) is scheduled to start in July, 2016.4.&nbsp;CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON &nbsp;STAR ZHANG ZIYI JOINS EAST/WEST COMEDYWhen Netflix launches the sequel Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny on February 26, 2016, Michelle Yeoh will be returning, but some of the other stars won’t be. One of them is Zhang Ziyi, but this week, the Chinese actress landed her own next major Hollywood project. Zhang is now attached to star in the Universal Pictures comedy East/West, to be directed by Jason Winer, who made his feature film debut in 2011 with the remake of Arthur. The connection between Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and East/West&nbsp;— and the person who was probably integral in recruiting Zhang Ziyi — is producer David Linde, whose other credits include the recent horror film The Forest,and the upcoming thriller Desierto. The premise of East/West hasn’t been revealed yet, except that (as the title suggests), it will be a “cross cultural comedy.” We’re calling this one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based on the Rotten score of 26 percent that Winer’s Arthur earned back in 2011.3.&nbsp;NAPOLEON DYNAMITE DIRECTOR TO GIVE US THE “ROGER RABBIT” OF… THE NICKTOONS UNIVERSE?After making his feature film debut with the Sundance Film Festival hit Napoleon Dynamite (71 percent Fresh), director Jared Hess has never since delivered a film with a Tomatometer score above 40 percent. We just want to get that little nugget out of the way to explain why this is one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas.” Okay, still with us? The news is that there’s going to be a NickToons movie. Jared Hess will indeed direct&nbsp;NickToons, the (presumably animated) film which will attempt to create a new “cinematic universe” tying together some of the Nickelodeon network’s biggest hits of the last 20 years. The titles reportedly included in this film (compared by Deadline to Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) run the gamut from pure “kids shows” like Rugrats, Rocko’s Modern Life, Aaahh! Real Monsters, and The Angry Beavers to edgier fare like Ren &amp; Stimpy, KaBlam!, and Action League Now. The ball is now in the court of competitors like Disney and Adult Swim as to whether they will answer with similar films. Jared Hess’s next film as director will be this fall’s live action comedy Masterminds (9/30/16), starring Kristen Wiig, Zach Galifianakis, Owen Wilson, and Jason Sudeikis.2. JOSEPH FIENNES CAST AS MICHAEL JACKSON IN WACKY 9/11 COMEDYIn the midst of #OscarsSoWhite and the reaction to this year’s 20/20 roster of Caucasian acting nominees, this story can be variably interpreted as either an example of horrible timing or perhaps an announcement that was timed this way completely on purpose (or, arguably, both). English actor Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare in Love) has been cast as African-American pop star Michael Jackson in the British comedy Elizabeth, Michael &amp; Marlon. As the title suggests, the comedy is based upon the (most likely apocryphal) urban legend that claimed that Michael Jackson, Elizabeth Taylor, and Marlon Brando teamed up for a NY-to-LA road trip in the days after September 11, 2011. Michael Jackson’s family has been quick to fire back at the production, with Michael’s nephew T.J. Jackson telling Entertainment Tonight that after 9/11/01, “Michael stayed with a family friend in New Jersey for a week before flying back.” Defending his own casting, Joseph Fiennes said, “He [Michael Jackson] was probably closer to my color than his original color.” The casting of Joseph Fiennes has quite overshadowed the other 2/3 of the leads, who will be played by Brian Cox (as Marlon Brando) and Grease star Stockard Channing (as Elizabeth Taylor).&nbsp;Elizabeth, Michael &amp; Marlon will premiere on the British pay TV network Sky Arts before its possible theatrical premiere via other companies.1.&nbsp;LABYRINTH REBOOT/SEQUEL ANNOUNCED 12 DAYS AFTER DEATH OF DAVID BOWIEProbably for unsurprising reasons, it’s far more common for celebrities to receive biopics after their deaths than while they’re still living. This particular headline feels like it’s in that vein, but it’s not a biopic in question, but rather a revisit to one of the most popular characters played by one of our most beloved recently departed stars. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016 at the age of 69, and twelve days later, the following news broke on January 22, 2016.&nbsp; The Jim Henson Company is moving forward with plans for a reboot of the 1986 fantasy/family film Labyrinth, in which Bowie starred as Jareth the Goblin King. (And which was also the last film directed by Jim Henson.) TriStar, a subsidiary of Sony Pictures, has finalized a deal with the Jim Henson Company for the new Labyrinth. The new film will be written by Nicole Perlman, who’s best known for cowriting Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy (and allegedly, for coming up with the idea of Marvel even doing a GotG movie at all). Perlman took to Twitter to clarify that the new film will not be a remake (and indeed, Perlman doesn’t even like the term “reboot”), which suggests that the film might be more of a sequel (or prequel, or something). Regardless of what Perlman’s film might end up being, even if it’s the greatest 30-years-later sequel-ish movie ever made, the timing of this news is really what makes this the most Rotten Idea of the week (which Perlman agrees with, saying “the timing of these rumors is so upsetting. I would never seek to profit from Bowie’s death”). &nbsp;Unfortunately, as we’ve seen many times in the past, screenwriters are often not in control of a film’s online publicity.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"spain, concert, Series, space, animated","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29180243/BirthOfANationKetchup.jpg","slug":"the-birth-of-a-nation-sets-a-sundance-record-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509194719673","title":"Jump Street/Men In Black Crossover Is On, and Other Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jump Street/Men In Black Crossover Is On, and Other Movie Newsby Greg Dean Schmitz | March 11, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as 23 Jump Street, Kingsman 2, Miss Saigon, Where’s Waldo?, Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, and Han Solo: A Star Wars Story.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryHILL AND TATUM TO “LOOK GOOD” IN JUMP STREET/MEN IN BLACK CROSSOVERThe end credits of 22 Jump Street teased several joke concepts for sequels.&nbsp; One of the concepts that was revealed in the late 2014 Sony Pictures e-mail leaks, however, was that what the studio was planning on was a crossover that would see the characters played by Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum being recruited to leave Ice Cube’s squad, and instead become Men in Black.&nbsp; That’s right, the same sort of Men in Black as in the secret agents played by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, who are tasked with keeping track of the various aliens who are secretly living here on Earth.&nbsp; This week, the spoiled secret was confirmed by the news that Sony Pictures is indeed proceeding with that crossover, and to that end, they have hired director James Bobin.&nbsp; Currently, James Bobin is best known for directing 2011’s The Muppets and its sequel Muppets: Most Wanted, and Bobin’s next film will be this year’s Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass (5/27/16).&nbsp; It is not yet known if Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones will be reprising their roles in the spirit of “handing off the baton”, ala the way Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise appeared in the first 21 Jump Street movie.Fresh Developments This Week1. ONE DIRECTION’S HARRY STYLES JOINS CHRISTOPHER NOLAN’S DUNKIRK &nbsp;As of this writing, Harry Styles is known almost exclusively as the lead singer&nbsp;of the British boy band One Direction, and not so much as an actor, but that’s really only because he’s never been in a movie or TV show before (as someone other than himself).&nbsp; Director Christopher Nolan, however, apparently wants to see what Harry Styles can do, because Nolan has cast Harry Styles&nbsp;in his World War II action drama Dunkirk.&nbsp; As the title suggests, the July 21, 2017 release will portray the Battle of Dunkirk&nbsp;of May and June, 1940, in which Allied forces fought to evacuate Dunkirk, France, as the Germans advanced West.&nbsp; Harry Styles wasn’t the only young actor cast this week, however, as he will also be joined by Fionn Whitehead&nbsp;(also making his feature film debut), and relative unknowns Jack Lowden and Aneurin Barnard. These four young actors join older veteran actors who have already been cast, namely, Kenneth Branagh, recent Academy Award winner Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy.2. DANNY BOYLE TO DIRECT MUSICAL ADAPTATION MISS SAIGONAlthough one of the most memorable scenes in Slumdog Millionaire was the Bollywood musical finale, to date, director Danny Boyle has not yet directed a film that is entirely a pure musical.&nbsp; That appears to be about to change, however, with the news this week that Danny Boyle is now attached to direct the long-in-development movie version of the hit musical Miss Saigon.&nbsp; As the title suggests, Miss Saigon is set in the final days of the Vietnam War&nbsp;as an American soldier falls in love with a Vietnamese girl.&nbsp; We probably, however, have a few years before we actually see Danny Boyle’s Miss Saigon, because his next film is expected to be his sequel to Trainspotting, which is scheduled to start filming in May, 2016.3. MICHAEL KEATON TO STAR AS AN AMERICAN ASSASSINFollowing critical and awards successes such as Birdman and Spotlight, the “comeback” of Michael Keaton continued this week with an announcement from the official website of bestselling author Vince Flynn.&nbsp; From Flynn comes the news that Lionsgate and CBS Films are uniting on an adaptation of his novel American Assassin, with Michael Keaton attached to star.&nbsp; Michael Keaton will play a Cold War veteran named Stan Hurley as a CIA trainer who is assigned to Mitch Rapp, “a black ops recruit devastated by the loss of his fiancée to a terrorist attack.&nbsp; As Rapp’s training progresses, the pair is dispatched on a joint mission with a lethal Turkish agent to stop a mysterious operative from starting World War III in the Middle East.” American Assassin will be directed by Michael Cuesta, whose previous four films all received “Fresh” RT Tomatometer scores&nbsp;(L.I.E., Twelve and Holding, Roadie, and Kill the Messenger).4. J.K. SIMMONS CAST AS COMMISSIONER GORDON IN JUSTICE LEAGUE PART ONEIn two weeks, when Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Jena Malone, who filmed scenes for the movie won’t be on the big screen (instead, she is expected to just be on the home video release).&nbsp; This week, however, following months of speculation, we did learn exactly who Jena Malone will be playing, and it’s Barbara Gordon, AKA Batgirl (and later, Oracle).&nbsp; This, then, was a big week for the Gordon family, because her dad also made the news.&nbsp; That’s because, in something of a major “get” for Warner Bros (away from Marvel), J.K. Simmons has been cast in Justice League Part One as Commissioner James Gordon .&nbsp; Fans of the first three Spider-Man movies will remember that J.K. Simmons rather brilliantly portrayed Peter Parker’s boss at the Daily Bugle, publisher J. Jonah Jameson.&nbsp; Some fans have hoped that perhaps J.K. Simmons would reprise his role in future Spider-Man movies (regardless of every one else being recast), but Simmons signing on with Marvel’s competition seems to suggest that won’t happen.&nbsp; Justice League Part One is scheduled for release on November 17, 2017, and Justice League Part Two is scheduled for June 14, 2019.5. CHEWBACCA WILL GET HIS ORIGIN STORY ALONG WITH HAN SOLO IN 2018We’ve known for a while that the second “Star Wars anthology” movie in 2018 would be about Han Solo as a young man, but this week, we learned that Han won’t be the only major Star Wars character to get his origin in that film.&nbsp; The film, which might be called Han Solo: A Star Wars Story, will also reveal the back story for Han’s partner in smuggling, Chewbacca, including, presumably, how they became friends.&nbsp; We still don’t know yet who will play the young Han Solo, and it’s also possible that a different actors than Peter Mayhew will play the young Chewbacca.&nbsp; What is known is that the Han Solo prequel will be directed by the team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The LEGO Movie, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs).&nbsp; Some sources still list a May, 2018 release date for this film, but it’s expected to probably be moved to December, 2018, following the December success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.4. DISNEY STAR ZENDAYA LANDS KEY ROLE IN THE SPIDER-MAN REBOOTThis week, fans got their first look at Tom Holland as the latest actor to play Spider-Man in the second trailer&nbsp;for Captain America: Civil War.&nbsp; Concurrently, filming is also about to start on the new Spider-Man movie (which might be called Spider-Man: The New Avenger), which is scheduled for July 7, 2017.&nbsp; Although Sony is distributing the film, and not Marvel/Disney, for the first of Peter Parker’s new batch of friends, Marvel and Sony have recruited a teen star who is most famous for starring on The Disney Channel.&nbsp; That’s because Zendaya has been cast in a “key female role” which has only been described as being named “Michelle.”&nbsp; That, however, was just enough information to lead people to speculate that Zendaya might be playing a younger version of Michelle Gonzales.&nbsp; In the comics, Michelle Gonzales is an adult and Peter Parker’s roommate.&nbsp; In this new Spider-Man movie, Peter Parker is expected to still be in high school, but Zendaya could still be playing a younger version of the same character.&nbsp; Whatever it’s called, the new solo Spider-Man movie will be directed by Jon Watts, who made his debut last year with Cop Car.3. WHERE’S WALDO?&nbsp; WHERE’S SETH ROGEN?The notion of a feature film based on the popular Where’s Waldo children’s books has been lingering around Hollywood since the 1990s, but it’s starting to look like such a movie might finally happen.&nbsp; This newest movement started in 2011, when MGM acquired the rights. This week, we learned that frequent comedy collaborators Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg &nbsp;(This is the End, The Interview) have come aboard Where’s Waldo? as at least producers.&nbsp; It’s unclear if Goldberg might also direct, or if Seth Rogen could possibly sign on to star as the red-and-white guy who’s very, very hard to spot in a crowd.2. HALLE BERRY JOINS KINGSMAN 2 AS THE HEAD OF THE CIAWe’ve known since soon after Kingsman: The Secret Service was released early last year that the sequel would involve Taron Egerton’s “Eggsy” character having further spy adventures in the USA.&nbsp; This news was followed by the recent casting of Julianne Moore as the main villain in Kingsman 2 (6/16/17).&nbsp; This week, another American actress was revealed as being in talks to play the head of the CIA, and it’s someone who has played a spy on the big screen before.&nbsp; That’s because Halle Berry costarred in the James Bond movie Die Another Day as Jinx, an agent of the NSA.&nbsp; Like the first film, Kingsman 2 will also be directed by Matthew Vaughn (X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass).Rotten Ideas of The Week1. DIRECTOR ZACK SNYDER WANTS TO DO GEORGE WASHINGTON 300 STYLETraditionally, Hollywood has not had much luck in adapting video games into successful movies, but if things are ever going to turn around, it might be in 2016.&nbsp; This year sees the release of three major video game movies: Angry Birds (5/10/16), Warcraft (6/10/16), and Assassin’s Creed (12/21/16).&nbsp; There are many other game adaptations in development, and new ones have been announced over the last two years as producers attempt to get ahead of the trend (ie, before licensing fees go up).&nbsp; This week, producer Roy Lee (The LEGO Movie, How to Train Your Dragon) joined a few others to license the rights&nbsp;to the Enix video game franchise Thief.&nbsp; There have been to date four Thief games, and like Assassin’s Creed, they are stealth-based.&nbsp; Screenwriters Adam Mason and Simon Boyes have been hired to start working on adapting Thief into a feature film.&nbsp; Most of their work has not earned scores on their RT Tomatometer, but their latest film, Misconduct, has a score&nbsp;of just 16%, which this week, is enough to earn this story the “Rotten Idea” tag.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"emmy, Network, movie, First, Returns, Martial, Peek, movies, Mary, show, E!, TBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/11170458/600JumpStreet.jpg","slug":"jump-street-men-in-black-crossover"},{"id":"47509194722746","title":"Spider-Man Nemesis Venom Gets His Spin-Off, and Other Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Spider-Man Nemesis Venom Gets His Spin-Off, and Other Movie Newsby Greg Dean Schmitz | March 4, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as A Christmas Carol, Death Wish, Ghost in the Shell, and Venom.This Week’s Top StorySPIDER-MAN ENEMY VENOM TO GET HIS OWN SPIN-OFF MOVIEWhen it was revealed last year that Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios were collaborating to reunite Spider-Man with the rest of the MCU (The Avengers, Captain America, Iron Man, etc), it left in question the other Marvel movies that Sony Pictures had in development, that there were going to be Spider-Man spinoffs, such as The Sinister Six, and a female-centric spinoff movie (rumored to be Black Cat).&nbsp; This week, Sony Pictures announced that they are indeed moving forward with plans for Venom, though exactly how they are doing it may come as a surprise.&nbsp; Instead of directly spinning off of Spider-Man (Venom actually started off as Peter Parker’s alien symbiote costume in the comics), Sony’s new Venom will be a standalone film which the studio is hoping will start a whole new franchise separate from Spider-Man (and ostensibly, likely the MCU as well).&nbsp; It is not yet known which version of Venom will form the basis of Sony’s first film, though the two most obvious candidates are reporter Eddie Brock and longtime Peter Parker adversary Flash Thompson, AKA Agent Venom.&nbsp; Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios have scheduled their first Spider-Man movie, played by Tom Holland, for next summer, July 7, 2017.Fresh Developments This Week1. CHRISTMAS IN MARCH: A CHRISTMAS CAROL, DISNEY’S THE NUTCRACKER AND THE FOUR REALMS&nbsp;This week, perhaps quite coincidentally, two of the biggest newest announced movies are both adaptations of classic Christmas stories.&nbsp; First off, Walt Disney Pictures is now developing a live action adaptation of E.T.A. Hoffman’s 1816 story,&nbsp;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, which was the inspiration for Tchaikovsky’s The Nutcracker Suite, which Disney previously adapted as part of the 1940 film Fantasia.&nbsp; This new live-action adaptation will be called The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, and it will be directed by Lasse Hallström, the Swedish director of such films as Chocolat, The Cider House Rules, and What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?&nbsp; As a direct adaptation of the story, rather than adapting the ballet, Hallstrom’s film is expected to be a more direct adaptation of the story of a young girl whose discovery of a Nutcracker doll leads to an adventure opposing the evil seven-headed Mouse King.&nbsp; The other Christmas movie announced this week is a new adaptation of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, which will be directed by Bennett Miller, whose previous films were The Cruise, Capote, Moneyball, and Foxcatcher.&nbsp; Miller’s A Christmas Carol will be adapted by screenwriter Tom Stoppard&nbsp;(Shakespeare in Love, Tulip Fever, Anna Karenina) as a 19th century story, instead of the more contemporary approach Hollywood sometimes uses.2. MILES TELLER AND JOSH BROLIN SIGN UP AS FIREFIGHTERS IN NO EXITJean-Paul Sartre may have written in his play No Exit that “Hell is other people” (finally, a real use of this writer’s Philosophy degree!), but in the upcoming film, the title will refer to a much more literal form of earthly hell.&nbsp; That’s because No Exit is the title of an action movie about the group of firefighters called the Granite Mountain Hotshots, who in 2013 lost&nbsp; 19 members while attempting to save a town in Arizona.&nbsp; Two of the film’s leads will be played by Josh Brolin and Miles Teller, leading what is expected to be an ensemble cast. &nbsp;No Exit will also be the next film for director Joseph Kosinski, who is moving to more realistic subject matter after his first two films, TRON: Legacy and Oblivion, both of which were science fiction.3. CULT FAVORITE BEAT KITANO JOINS HOLLYWOOD’S GHOST IN THE SHELLPrevious casting news about the Hollywood live action remake of the anime classic Ghost in the Shell has been very much part of the ongoing discussion of the practice referred to as “whitewashing” (Caucasian actors being cast in roles that could, or arguably, “should” have been played by other races).&nbsp; Specifically, this allegation was made on social media when Scarlett Johansson and Michael Pitt were announced as playing the lead (called Motoko Kusanagi in the original) and The Laughing Man, respectively.&nbsp; This week’s news from DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures could then be seen as something of a reaction to that, as the new Ghost in the Shell now has its first Japanese actor.&nbsp; Takeshi Kitano (AKA Beat Kitano) has been cast in Ghost in the Shell as Chief Aramaki, the leader of the elite “Section 9” taskforce which unites humans and cyborgs in the fight against the world’s most dangerous technological threats.&nbsp; Ghost in the Shell will be directed by Rupert Sanders, who made his feature film debut in 2012 with Snow White and the Huntsman.&nbsp; This will be the first time that Beat Kitano has appeared as an actor in a Hollywood film since 1995’s Johnny Mnemonic, which was also a cyberpunk action movie.4. SAM RAIMI TO DIRECT AMBITIOUS WORLD WAR 3 (WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE)As common, catchy, and portentous as the phrase World War III is, you would think that by 2016, Hollywood would have long since made a big tentpole type movie with that title, and yet, such a movie has never happened… yet.&nbsp; If this week’s news pans out, that may finally change within the next few years.&nbsp; That’s because director Sam Raimi&nbsp;(Spider-Man, Evil Dead 2) is now attached to direct a movie&nbsp;called World War 3.&nbsp; Raimi’s film will be an adaptation of the non-fiction book The Next 100 Years: A Forecast of the 21st Century, by George Friedman.&nbsp; Friedman’s book makes a series of bold predictions, including a new Cold War between the USA and Russia, changes in fortune for China and Mexico, a new Space Race, and indeed, a global war between the United States and other nations.&nbsp; Sam Raimi’s World War 3 will be distributed by Warner Bros.Rotten Ideas of The Week5. MAX LANDIS’ BRIGHT INSPIRES SUICIDE SQUAD REUNIONSince making his feature film debut four years ago with Chronicle, screenwriter Max Landis has a string of three critical failures&nbsp;(which seems unlikely to be broken next year by Power Rangers, which Max Landis is also credited on).&nbsp; This week, Max Landis made the news for a spec script called Bright which already has a few big names attached to it.&nbsp; Two of them are director David Ayer (Fury, Sabotage) and actor Will Smith, both of whom worked together on this summer’s Suicide Squad, making Bright a reunion project.&nbsp; Joel Edgerton&nbsp;(The Great Gatsby, Exodus: Gods and Kings) is also attached to star in the contemporary cop thriller with “fantastical elements” (the nature of which we don’t know yet).&nbsp; The plan is for Bright to start filming in late 2016&nbsp;so that David Ayer will be ready to start filming a Suicide Squad sequel possibly as early as next year, 2017.4. DISNEY CEO DECLARES NO PLANS FOR R-RATED MARVEL STUDIOS MOVIESWhen Deadpool opened to over $130 million domestically&nbsp;, its success seemed to demolish for many fans what Hollywood had long been telling fans about the box office feasibility of R-rated superhero movies.&nbsp; Obviously, not every superhero is as popular as Deadpool, and not every superhero should or could benefit from having an R rating.&nbsp; But still, this has led to much speculation the last few movies that perhaps Marvel Studios could give some of their more “adult themed” superheroes an R rating in a post-Deadpool climate (such as say, Moon Knight, The Punisher, or Carnage).&nbsp; Well, this week, Disney CEO Bob Iger seemed to be nipping that notion right in the bud, as he was quoted as saying, “We don’t have any plans to make R-rated Marvel movies.”&nbsp; Of course, that may play out to be a good thing on the small screen, as Netflix is continuing to make exactly those sort of Marvel Comics adaptations with their adaptations of titles like Daredevil, Alias (Jessica Jones), Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders (and possibly soon, The Punisher).3. BRUCE WILLIS TO STAR IN CHARLES BRONSON REMAKE DEATH WISH &nbsp;Although many studios have dabbled in remakes and reboots, the studio that arguably remakes more of its classic films than any other these days is MGM.&nbsp; Recent examples include Carrie, RoboCop, Hercules, Poltergeist, and this year’s Ben-Hur and The Magnificent Seven.&nbsp; And MGM is showing no sign of ever slowing down their remakes, which includes this week’s news.&nbsp; Paramount Pictures (the original studio) and MGM (the current rights owner) are partnering on a remake of the 1974 Charles Bronson thriller Death Wish, about a man who goes on a gun-crazy rampage after his daughter and wife are attacked.&nbsp; For the remake, the two studios have recruited Bruce Willis to take over the role first played by Charles Bronson.&nbsp; Aharon Keshales and Navot Papushado, the Israeli directors behind the 2013 film Big Bad Wolves are expected to make their Hollywood debuts with this Death Wish remake, which like the first 1974 film, is also an adaptation of the novel of the same title by Brian Garfield.2. “DESIGNER TOY BRAND” KIDROBOT TO GET ITS OWN MOVIE?Hollywood doesn’t always learn the right lessons from its collective successes (or failures).&nbsp; Take, for example, The LEGO Movie.&nbsp; Hollywood in the last two years has ignored the dozens of properties in which LEGO was adapted narratively (including a few DTV movies), and instead sees LEGO as a non-narrative license.&nbsp; Therefore, the reasoning goes, any such popular non-narrative toy license can be adapted as a hugely successful feature film.&nbsp; That’s arguably why we now have Playmobil, Minecraft, and Play-Doh movies in development.&nbsp; This week brought news of another such license movie deal, and it’s the brand called Kidrobot (which directly involves neither kids nor robots).&nbsp; Instead, Kidrobot is a franchise of toys and figures&nbsp;that frequently adapts other popular licenses, sometimes in a stylized “bunny” form.&nbsp; MGM is the studio behind the Kidrobot movie, and the lead producer is Scott Aversano, whose filmography includes The Last Airbender, Safe House, and That Awkward Moment.&nbsp; Unlike most of the previously mentioned examples, MGM’s Kidrobot will be live-action, and will be about robots.&nbsp; This week, MGM signed director Robert Rugan to direct Kidrobot as his second feature film after making his debut in 2004 with the low-budget Alice’s Misadventures in Wonderland.&nbsp; The Kidrobot script was adapted by the team of screenwriters Matt Ember and Tom J. Astle, whose filmography includes cowriting duties on the animated movies Home and Epic.1. DIRECTOR ZACK SNYDER WANTS TO DO GEORGE WASHINGTON 300 STYLEIn the realm of film development news, sometimes traditional media sources “bury the lead.”&nbsp; Something like that happened this week when Bloomberg Business ran a 20+ paragraph profile on director Zack Snyder&nbsp;(three weeks before Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice comes out).&nbsp; Zack Snyder is currently almost halfway through the four DC Comics movies he’s expected to direct (the first being Man of Steel, and the two Justice League movies are the second half).&nbsp; But what will Zack Snyder do in 2020 or so, when he might be wanting to direct something other than superheroes?&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, one of Snyder’s dream films involves General George Washington, and his inspiration comes from what might be the most famous painting of him.&nbsp; That’s because a print of Emanuel Leutze’s Washington Crossing the Delaware that hangs in Snyder’s office may be inspiring him to make a George Washington action movie about the Battle of Trenton, “in the style of 300.”&nbsp; Although 300 was a box office hit (and just barely “Fresh” with 60%), it’s the sort of movie that when evoked, might conjure unintended imagery.&nbsp; What exactly would George Washington “in the style of 300” even look like?&nbsp; Would half the movie be in slo-mo, including the actual river crossing that inspired the painting?&nbsp; We’re calling this the week’s Most Rotten Idea because the idea of giving George Washington that sort of overly stylized action movie treatment just seems so far afield.&nbsp; (And there’s also Snyder’s RT Tomatometer, the last three films on which have all had “Rotten” scores.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Music, Musical, TV, Funimation, telelvision, TruTV, crime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/05000755/600Venom.jpg","slug":"venom-gets-spin-off"},{"id":"47509194718648","title":"Harrison Ford Back as Indiana Jones, Lobo Following Deadpool Success, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Harrison Ford Back as Indiana Jones, Lobo Following Deadpool Success, and More Movie Newsby Greg Dean Schmitz | March 18, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as DC’s Lobo, Ready Player One, the Morrissey biopic, and Han Solo: A Star Wars Story.This Week’s Top StoryHARRISON FORD TO RETURN AS SPIELBERG’S INDIANA JONES IN 2019When the news broke in 2014 that Harrison Ford had broken his leg while reprising his role as Han Solo in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it might have seemed like that it was a sign that Ford would be unlikely to ever commit to such an action role again.&nbsp; This week, however, we learned that the actor will indeed be returning as the iconic character who is arguably Ford’s most action-driven.&nbsp; Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Pictures have announced&nbsp;a July 19, 2019 release date for the fifth Indiana Jones movie , to be directed once again by Steven Spielberg.&nbsp; This will likely be Spielberg’s third upcoming film, after The BFG (7/1/16) and Ready Player One (3/30/18).&nbsp; That release date also coincidentally happens to be just 6 days after what will be Harrison Ford’s 77th birthday, on July 13, 2019.&nbsp; We don’t know yet what form the fifth Indiana Jones movie will take, although based on Ford’s age, and Indiana Jones’ fictional birth year (1899), that the movie could be set in the “disco age” of the 1970s.&nbsp; We also learned this week that this fifth Indiana Jones will once again be written by screenwriter David Koepp, who infamously gave the world the scene where Indiana Jones avoids a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator (real life spoiler: that wouldn’t work).&nbsp; In the past, Indiana Jones has had adventures involving the Ark of the Covenant, a death cult, the Holy Grail, and aliens.&nbsp; What do you think is next for Indy?Fresh Developments This Week1. THE SEARCH FOR YOUNG HAN SOLO NARROWS DOWN TO FIVE NAMESWe’ve known for a while now that Lucasfilm’s second “A Star Wars Story” franchise, after this year’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (12/16/16), would be a prequel set much farther back, depicting the adventures of the much younger Han Solo (TBA 2018).&nbsp; In January, the news broke that Disney and Lucasfilm had considered over 2,500 young actors for the role.&nbsp; At that time, the potential actors included&nbsp;Ansel Elgort, Dave Franco, Aaron Taylor-Johnson (from one source), and Scott Eastwood, Blake Jenner, Logan Lerman, and Miles Teller&nbsp;(from another source).&nbsp; This week, the news broke that the two companies are getting closer to narrowing their selection down, with three names being disclosed as being among the handful of actors that might play the new, younger Han Solo.&nbsp; Those three actors are Alden Ehrenreich (the cowboy singing star in Hail, Caesar!), Taron Egerton (of both Eddie the Eagle and Kingsman: The Secret Service), and Jack Reynor (Transformers: Age of Extinction).&nbsp; This final group was reportedly selected from a group of ten actors that also included Emory Cohen, Ansel Elgort, and Miles Teller (it’s unclear if any of them are still in the running or not).&nbsp; Whoever actually does land the very sought-after role as the young Han Solo will be joined by a young Chewbacca and the directing team of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (21 Jump Street, The LEGO Movie).&nbsp; Some sources list a release date for Han Solo: A Star Wars Story of May 25, 2018, but recent changes suggest Disney/Lucasfilm will move the film to December, 2018.2. SIMON PEGG JOINS SPIELBERG’S READY PLAYER ONE IN CRUCIAL THIRD ACT ROLEIn between this summer’s children’s fantasy The BFG (7/1/16), and the recently confirmed 5th Indiana Jones (7/19/19), we know of at least one film that Steven Spielberg will be directing.&nbsp; That film will be an adapation of the popular science fiction novel, Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline (cowriter of 2009’s Fanboys).&nbsp; To date, we have heard casting news for two fo the film’s young stars (Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke), and the film’s corporate villain (Ben Mendelsohn).&nbsp; We’re still waiting on the third young co-lead (“Aech”), and the Steve Jobs-like character who sets about the Willy-Wonka-style treasure hunt that drives the entire story.&nbsp; This week, however, we did find out who will be playing Ogden Morrow, the story’s analogy to Apple’s Steve Wozniak, and it’s none other than fan favorite Simon Pegg.&nbsp; Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros plan on starting filming of Ready Player One in June, to get the film ready for its release date on March 30, 2018 (moved back recently from late 2017 to avoid direct competition with Star Wars Episode VIII).3. OCTAVIA SPENCER TO STAR IN GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S SUPERNATURAL COLD WAR THRILLERFor some directors, we only really hear about their films when they’re producing them, and those films are mostly what make up their eventual filmographies (Noah Baumbach, Woody Allen, and Christopher Nolan are good examples of this approach).&nbsp; Other directors, however, become known for their massive development slates, making the news a few times a year for new film possibilities.&nbsp; Guillermo Del Toro is definitely in that camp, with his name attached in recent years&nbsp;to more movies than he’s ever actually directed (Crimson Peak was GDT’s ninth feature film as director).&nbsp; Considering all of the options that have been floated around, it’s surprising therefore to learn this week that Guillermo Del Toro’s next film probably won’t be any of those (such as Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyl &amp; Mr. Hyde, Justice League Dark, or Slaughterhouse-Five), but will instead be an original project.&nbsp; Octavia Spencer was the first actor to be announced for the mystery film, which is described as being a mysterious supernatural (and “otherworldy”) romance set in America during the Cold War period (specifically, 1963).&nbsp; That news was soon followed by the news that Sally Hawkins (Godzilla, Happy-Go-Lucky) has also joined the film, which Fox Searchlight expects to start filming this summer.&nbsp; Octavia Spencer is also attached to star in Fox 2000’s Hidden Figures (about the African American women who helped NASA solve mathematical challenges), along with Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae, Kevin Costner, and Kirsten Dunst.4. CREED SUCCESS LANDS MOVIE DEAL FOR OLYMPIAN CLARESSA “T. REX” SHIELDSFollowing the $174 million box office and critical success of Creed, it was probably inevitable that Hollywood would be seeking other similar stories to adapt next.&nbsp; One such true story is that of Claressa “T. Rex” Shields, who in 2012 became the first American woman to win an Olympic Gold Medal as a boxer, at the age of just 17.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shields, who celebrated her 21st birthday (St. Patrick’s Day), received quite a birthday present this week in the form of a biopic deal with Universal Pictures.&nbsp; That project will be shepherded by veteran producer Michael De Luca, whose filmography includes Captain Phillips, Moneyball, The Social Network, and the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Claressa Shields’ route to Olympic Gold, from her meager beginnings in Flint, MI was previously depicted in the 2015 documentary T. Rex (the rights to which were included in the life story rights deal).&nbsp; Claressa Shields also qualified, on her birthday, to compete as a Middleweight in this summer’s 2016 Olympics in Rio De Janeiro .&nbsp; It’s not yet known who will write, direct, or star in this Claressa “T. Rex” Shields biopic.5. THIS CHARMING MAN (JACK LOWDEN) TO STAR IN MORRISSEY BIOPIC, STEVENAs time goes on, some musicians are able to create legacies and loyal fanbases that betray exactly how popular they were at the time (meanwhile, some bands and artists that actually had more hits at the time fade into obscurity).&nbsp; One singer from the 1980s and 1990s who has been something of a master at developing that sort of lifelong devotion is Steven Patrick Morrissey, AKA Morrissey, the solo act and former frontman of The Smiths.&nbsp; The Smiths didn’t play at Live Aid, and none of their albums (while they were still together) ever charted on the U.S. Billboard Top 200 higher than #55, but to many music fans, they are one of the most iconic 1980s groups.&nbsp; It’s in this environment that the news broke this week that Morrissey is going to finally become the subject of his own biopic.&nbsp; The movie will be called simply Steven, and it will tell the story of Morrissey as a teenager in 1970s and early 1980s Manchester, England, in the years leading to the formation of The Smiths.&nbsp; Morrissey will be portrayed by relative newcomer Jack Lowden, who recently costarred in the BBC mini-series adaptation of War &amp; Peace.&nbsp; Steven will also mark the feature film debut of director Mark Gill (who also cowrote it), and filming is scheduled to start next month, in April, 2016.Rotten Ideas of The Week4. DISNEY’S LIVE ACTION REMAKES… ARE FINALLY GETTING AROUND TO THE BLACK CAULDRON?In the documentary Waking Sleeping Beauty, about the animation studio’s slump years, there is a scene in which producer Jeffrey Katzenberg is portrayed as reacting to their 1985 animated film The Black Cauldron.&nbsp; Paraphrasing, Katzenberg reportedly said something like, “you’re scaring the children!”, about the film’s dark fantasy sequences (leading in a short time to Disney producing lighter fantasies like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin).&nbsp; Of course, tastes have changed a lot in the last 30 years, and the argument could be made that perhaps some scenes are actually less scary in live action than in traditional animation (less spooky, anyway).&nbsp; In that vein, consider the news this week that Walt Disney Pictures has re-acquired the film rights to the five novel series The Chronicles of Prydain by author Lloyd Alexander.&nbsp; It was the first two books of that series that were adapted in 1985 as The Black Cauldron.&nbsp; Based on Welsh mythology, The Chronicles of Prydain follow a young pigherd as he dreams of becoming an epic hero, through a series of adventures, fighting against the plots of the evil Horned King.&nbsp; It’s not yet known if Disney plans on just a single film, or five individual entries adapting the entire series.3. MERC WITH A MOUTH” (DEADPOOL) SUCCESS IS GOOD NEWS FOR DC’S “MAIN MAN” (LOBO)&nbsp;&nbsp;There’s a reason people have been saying about Hollywood and the movie business that “no one knows anything.”&nbsp; Producers and fans alike are regularly surprised by what is (and isn’t) going to become a huge box office hit.&nbsp; Every once in a while, a movie like Deadpool comes along that seems to break several rules of “traditional wisdom,” and that movie does way better than most people expected.&nbsp; Just like what happened with Guardians of the Galaxy (which arguably led to this summer’s Suicide Squad), it immediately seemed obvious that Warner Bros and DC Comics would be “inspired” by the success 20th Century has had with Marvel’s Deadpool.&nbsp; One character that WB and DC have been trying to get on the big screen for several years now is the intergalactic bounty hunter known as Lobo.&nbsp; With a style similar to both Wolverine and “bikers”, Lobo became a popular character in the 1990s, around the same time that Deadpool was also becoming popular (for similar reasons).&nbsp; This week, the news broke that the Lobo film is back in development, with writing duties now being handled by screenwriter Jason Fuchs, who has previously worked on Pan (27% RT Tomatometer), Ice Age: Continental Drift (37%), and next year’s Wonder Woman.&nbsp; Those low scores are what makes this one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.2. IS THE WORLD READY FOR AYN RAND’S THE FOUNTAINHEAD… DIRECTED BY ZACK SNYDER?It was just two weeks ago that we heard&nbsp;that director Zack Snyder (Sucker Punch, Man of Steel) was considering directing a George Washington action movie, in the style of 300.&nbsp; That story came from a lengthier interview which touched on other subjects, and this week, the same thing happened again, but this time, Zack Snyder talked about his ideas for a completely different project.&nbsp; Zack Snyder revealed that he is also developing a new adaptation of Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead (that’s the one about architect Howard Roark), based on Rand’s screenplay for the 1949 movie starring Gary Cooper.&nbsp; Such a film is most likely at least a few years away from getting made (if it ever does), since most of Snyder’s time in the next few years will be devoted to Justice League Part One (11/17/17) and Justice League Part Two (6/14/19).&nbsp; Zack Snyder’s RT Tomatometer since 2009’s Watchmen has been all “Rotten” scores&nbsp;(though next week’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice may change that?).1. THIS WEEK’S MOST ROTTEN REMAKE IDEA: THE CANNONBALL RUNThe success of the Fast and Furious franchise obviously shows that there is an audience for racing movies, but other attempts to replicate that in recent years have mostly not paid off (Need for Speed, Rush, Speed Racer, etc.). One film that did, however, was 2006’s Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. &nbsp;It’s possibly in that direction then that executives at Warner Bros are leaning this week with the news of their continued development of this racing comedy remake.&nbsp; That remake is The Cannonball Run, based on the 1981 movie featuring an ensemble cast (including Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Jackie Chan, Farrah Fawcett, and Roger Moore), which earned $72 million (in 1981 dollarydoos, that’s&nbsp;enough to make it the #6 movie of the year).&nbsp; For this remake, Warner Bros has hired director Etan Cohen, who made his debut last year with the Will Ferrell/Kevin Hart comedy Get Hard.&nbsp; That film received a “Rotten” score of just 29%, but Cohen’s career as a screenwriter earned better scores, such as with Tropic Thunder (Certified Fresh, 83%).&nbsp; Warner Bros hasn’t disclosed which stars they hope will star in this Cannonball Run remake, although given his ties to both Get Hard and Talladega Nights, one could theorize that Warner Bros might hope to recruit Will Ferrell to be… their new Burt Reynolds? Who would be Ferrell’s Dom DeLuise?&nbsp; And will you stay through the credits to see the gag/blooper reel?","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"CBS, golden, Endgame, Month, spy, criterion, Trivia, Pride, adaptation","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/18164320/600IndianaJones.jpg","slug":"harrison-ford-indiana-jones-lobo"},{"id":"47509196295622","title":"Idris Elba Wanted for Stephen King’s The Dark Tower, Plus More Hollywood Headlines","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Idris Elba Wanted for Stephen King's The Dark Tower, Plus More Hollywood HeadlinesCate Blanchett joins Thor: Ragnarok, Ryan Coogler may direct Black Panther, and Will Smith wants Deadshot in Affleck's Batman.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 11, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the fast-moving online world of film development news, those stories about what movies Hollywood will be delivering to us in the months and years to come.&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are such movies as Stephen King’s The Dark Tower, Marvel’s Black Panther and Thor: Ragnarok, Universal’s The Mummy, and new roles for Benedict Cumberbatch, Matt Damon, and Dwayne Johnson.This Week’s Top StoryIDRIS ELBA AS ROLAND DESCHAIN IN STEPHEN KING’S THE DARK TOWER?Although Idris Elba has had a few prominent roles in genre films such as playing Heimdall in the Thor movies, or as Stacker Pentecost in Pacific Rim, he doesn’t yet have a major franchise of his own. (That is, unless he really does replace Daniel Craig as James Bond someday.) Elba’s biggest chance may be coming soon, however, with the news that he has emerged as the frontrunner for one of Sony Pictures’ biggest upcoming adaptations. Reportedly, Idris Elba is wanted to star as Roland Deschain the Gunslinger in Sony’s adaptations of Stephen King’s many novels in The Dark Tower series. If negotiations begin, Idris Elba would be joining Matthew McConaughey, who is also in talks to costar as Randall Flagg, AKA The Man in Black, the series’ main villain. At least the first film in Sony’s The Dark Tower series will be directed by Danish director Nikolaj Arcel, who is best known for directing A Royal Affair, and the Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (the one starring Noomi Rapace). Idris Elba’s upcoming films in 2016 include voicing Shere Khan in Disney’s The Jungle Book (4/15/16), also providing a voice for Finding Dory (6/17/16), and costarring in Star Trek Beyond (7/22/16).Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;MARVEL LANDS ANOTHER MAJOR MOVIE STAR: CATE BLANCHETT IN THOR: RAGNAROKHollywood is increasingly divided into three camps: those who have worked with Marvel, those who have worked with WB/DC, and those who just haven’t landed their opportunity yet. (Though there are at least 15 who have done both, they are still a relative minority.)&nbsp;There are still some major players who have not yet signed on for their turn at a superhero role, but that list grows a little smaller with each big new film that casts up. This week, we can cross Cate Blanchett off that list, as she is now in talks to take an unspecified role in Marvel’s Thor: Ragnarok (11/3/17). Although Blanchett’s role is being kept secret for now, there are at least three major roles that are both likely to be in Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;and could be played by her. Let’s address them in reverse order of Blanchett’s probability of playing them. First, there’s Brunnhilde the Valkyrie, who has already been semi-confirmed as appearing&nbsp;in Thor: Ragnarok, but who is the most physical of our three guesses, which is not Cate Blanchett’s most obvious wheelhouse. A second possibility is Amora the Enchantress, and although Cate Blanchett has played a sorceress before (in the Lord of the Rings movies), Marvel might be more likely to cast a young actress for the role (Blanchett will turn 48 in 2017). A third possibility is Hela, the ruler of Hel,&nbsp;the Norse afterworld, who in the comics is the daughter of Loki (though being immortals, this point might be more fixable).&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok will also feature Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, and will be directed by Taika Waititi (codirector of What We Do in the Shadows).2.&nbsp;MATT DAMON, JOSH BROLIN, AND JULIANNE MOORE MAY JOIN GEORGE CLOONEY’S SUBURBICONAfter starring in four movies directed by the Coen Brothers (including next year’s Hail, Caesar!), George Clooney is now (sort of) returning the favor by directing a film that Joel and Ethan Coen wrote. The title is Suburbicon, and it’s described as being a 1950s film noir in the style of the Coens’ first film, Blood Simple. This week, we learned which stars George Clooney is talking to about starring in Suburbicon, and it’s an impressive trio. The three stars are Matt Damon (Clooney’s costar in the Ocean’s Eleven movies), Julianne Moore (who worked with the Coens on The Big Lebowski), and Josh Brolin (who starred in the Coens’ No Country for Old Men).&nbsp;Suburbicon is being independently financed, but Sony Pictures is seen as the studio most likely to distribute.3. CREED DIRECTOR RYAN COOGLER IN TALKS FOR MARVEL’S BLACK PANTHERLate last Friday, just as the Weekly Ketchup was going live, the news broke that Marvel has finally ended one of its longest directorial searches. The movie in question is Black Panther (2/16/18), and the director who is now in talks is Ryan Coogler. Although not yet a household name, Ryan Coogler already has two Certified Fresh films under his belt with Fruitvale Station and the recent Rocky spinoff Creed. Chadwick Boseman was announced last year to be starring as T’Challa, AKA the Black Panther, starting with a prominent role in next summer’s Captain America: Civil War (5/6/16). This will be Ryan Coogler’s first film where the lead role isn’t played by Michael B. Jordan, but there are likely still plenty of supporting roles in Black Panther that Jordan could play (especially since Jordan’s Fantastic Four role was not in a Marvel Studios production).4.&nbsp;DAVID OYELOWO: FROM MLK JR. TO… BOXING LEGEND JOE FRAZIER?Director Ang Lee last year decided to delay his plans for a HFR (high frame rate) 3D boxing movie due to technological limits, directing the Iraq War satire Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk instead (11/11/16). But now, it looks like the movie is back on track again. Ang Lee’s boxing movie, which might use a frame rate as high as 120 (more than twice that of The Hobbit), now looks like it is back on his near-term schedule, as a new production company has picked it up from Universal Pictures. Lee’s film doesn’t currently have an official title, but it is based on the famous 1975 “Thrilla in Manila” match between in heavyweights Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Although no deals are as of yet in place, Ang Lee reportedly hopes to cast David Oyelowo (Selma, Interstellar) as Joe Frazier. For Muhammad Ali, Ang Lee likewise hopes to recruit Ray Fisher, who will be starring in WB/DC’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the Justice League movies as Victor Stone, AKA Cyborg.5.&nbsp;J.J. ABRAMS THINKS AVA DUVERNAY SHOULD DIRECT A STAR WARS MOVIEWith less than a week from Star Wars: The Force Awakens finally being released, the online world has been as expected sort of deluged with publicity for the film. While talking to Yahoo! Movies, director J.J. Abrams dropped something of an insight bomb. Specifically, Abrams said, “One name that immediately comes to mind is Ava DuVernay, who I thought did just a mind-blowingly great job with Selma… and getting to know her a little since that movie, she is such a fan of genre films and storytelling.” Ava DuVernay had also briefly been considered for the job of directing Marvel’s Black Panther (which, like the Star Wars movies, is also owned by Disney). This revelation follows another recent one that Disney and Lucasfilm are seeking female writers and directors&nbsp;for future Star Wars movies. In other Ava DuVernay news, this was also the week when the limited edition Ava DuVernay Barbie doll went on sale, and quickly went out of sale, because it sold out within minutes.6.&nbsp;BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH: FROM DOCTOR STRANGE TO THE WAR MAGICIANBenedict Cumberbatch is currently in the midst of starring as Marvel’s Sorcerer Supreme in Doctor Strange, but the actor is already lining up another role in which he will play a (less magical) magician. Benedict Cumberbatch will star in the long-in-development World War II drama The War Magician, which will be based upon the book by David Fisher.&nbsp;The War Magician will tell the true story of Jasper Maskelyne, a British 1930s/1940s magician who with a group called “The Magic Gang” worked with British intelligence during World War II. Maskelyne’s team used their knowledge of stage trickery to deceive German forces, such as inflating hundreds of balloons to create the deception of massive tank forces where there weren’t really any. At one point in the film’s long development, Tom Cruise had previously been attached to star as Jasper Maskelyne.&nbsp;The War Magician is currently being adapted by Gary Whitta, the same screenwriter who wrote the upcoming Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (12/16/16).7.&nbsp;DWAYNE JOHNSON TO STAR IN BUDDY ACTION COMEDYDwayne Johnson is establishing quite a plank of upcoming action comedies. Johnson’s schedule for the next few years includes taking over for David Hasselhoff in the Baywatch movie, the Rampage arcade video game monster movie, and next summer’s Central Intelligence spy movie with Kevin Hart (6/17/16). We can now add a fourth action comedy to that list with this week’s news. Dwayne Johnson is attached to star in an untitled New Line Cinema “mismatched buddy action comedy” reportedly in the style of Lethal Weapon, 48 Hrs, and Midnight Run. The project landed at New Line Cinema after the studio outbid three other studios. Johnson has a strong relationship with New Line Cinema, which handled this year’s San Andreas, and also where both Rampage, Central Intelligence and Shazam are based (Dwayne Johnson is expected to play Black Adam in Shazam). This untitled buddy action movie will be directed by Will Gluck (Easy A, Friends with Benefits) from a script by Dave Callaham (cowriter of Doom, The Expendables).Rotten Ideas of The Week2. KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE STAR UNWRAPPED AS THE MUMMYIf there was just one breakout star from this past spring’s Kingsman: The Secret Service, well… it was probably Taron Egerton. But if there were two such discoveries, then the second one was definitely Sofia Boutella, who played Gazelle, the amputee assassin with huge blades for legs (which is not to be confused with Rose McGowan’s machine gun leg in Grindhouse). Sofia Boutella’s opportunity for a post-Kingsman boost may have taken longer than for Taron Egerton (who is already starring with Hugh Jackman in next year’s Eddie the Eagle), but this week, her turn came. Boutella is now in talks with Universal Pictures to star as the title character in their next reboot of The Mummy (3/24/17). This version of The Mummy, which is obviously female instead of male, will also start Universal’s new franchise of “Classic Universal Monster” movies all connected in the same cinematic universe, a la Marvel’s. Tom Cruise is also in talks for the male (non-Mummy) lead in The Mummy. The 2017 version of The Mummy will be directed by Alex Kurtzman, whose Tomatometer is 2/3 Rotten, hence why we’re calling this one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas.”1.&nbsp;RUMOR: WILL SMITH WANTS TO PLAY DEADSHOT IN BEN AFFLECK’S SOLO BATMAN?If there’s one thing Batman has plenty of, it’s famous and memorable villains. Indeed, the argument could be made that he has the strongest rogue’s gallery of any superhero in the history of comic books, and that’s even including Spider-Man, who, regardless, probably still holds that title among Marvel’s heroes. One of the villains who did indeed first appear in the pages of Batman is the assassin Deadshot, who will be played by Will Smith next year in Suicide Squad (8/5/16). This week, a new rumor emerged that Will Smith is hoping to convince Warner Bros to also use his character Deadshot in a few years when Ben Affleck gets his own solo Batman movie. As we sort of were suggesting by how we led into this article, the problem with including Deadshot in the first solo Batman movie is that there is very much a risk that he will potentially crowd out one of Batman’s other famous villains for whom that film may be their only shot at exposure. There is something of a fine balance between just enough and too many villains, and it’s one that superhero movies regularly grapple with (see also: Spider-Man 3, and well, more Batman movies than not). Even without Will Smith as Deadshot, the first Ben Affleck Batman could have five different villains, and barely get close to covering more than a quarter of his major foes.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"criterion","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11165251/IdrisElbaKetchup.jpg","slug":"idris-elba-wanted-for-stephen-kings-the-dark-tower-plus-more-hollywood-headlines"},{"id":"47509196304843","title":"Noomi Rapace Will Star In An Amy Winehouse Biopic, Call of Duty Gets A Movie, and More Hollywood Headlines","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Noomi Rapace Will Star In An Amy Winehouse Biopic, Call of Duty Gets A Movie, and More Hollywood HeadlinesNew roles for Paul Rudd, Key and Peele, Keanu Reeves, Anne Hathaway, Samuel L. Jackson, Nicole Kidman, and more.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 6, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you ten stories from the realm of film development news, covering the latest about movies that Hollywood is working on for the years to come.&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are headlines about such movies as the video game adaptations Call of Duty and The Witcher, and new roles for Anne Hathaway, Ice Cube, Samuel L. Jackson, Paul Rudd, and the comedy team of Key &amp; Peele.This Week’s Top StoryNOOMI RAPACE TO STAR IN AMY WINEHOUSE BIOPICBritish singer Amy Winehouse had only been 20 for a few weeks when her first album was released, but her path to stardom took her to the top quickly. As the world learned in 2011, however, Winehouse’s struggles with substance abuse would eventually lead to her tragic&nbsp;death&nbsp;at the age of 27. Negotiations are now underway with Winehouse’s father Mitch Winehouse for the rights to produce a feature film biopic about the meteoric rise and fall of Amy Winehouse. The currently untitled project was written and will be directed by Kirsten Sheridan, who wrote her father’s film In America (for which she was nominated for an Academy Award), and directed the 2007 film August Rush. These plans follow the recent box office success of the documentary Amy, which Winehouse’s father has “distanced himself from.” For the lead role, the producers are negotiating with Swedish actress Noomi Rapace, who&nbsp;has been an in-demand actress in Hollywood since she first came to attention in 2009 as the star of the three Swedish films adapting Stieg Larsson’s Millennium Trilogy “nordic noir” novels as the gothic hacker Lisbeth Salander. Sony Pictures and director David Fincher followed those films with their own English-language adaptation of the first novel, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, starring Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig. There had been an expectation that Sony would continue the franchise with an adaptation of The Girl Who Played with Fire, but this week, we learned that the studio is skipping Larsson’s remaining novels entirely. Instead, Sony Pictures is now developing an adaptation of The Girl in the Spider’s Web, which was written by David Lagercrantz, continuing the Millennium series following Stieg Larsson’s death in 2004. Fincher, Craig, and Mara are all expected to not be involved with this film. Sony is reportedly considering another Swedish actress, Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina), to take over the role originated by Noomi Rapace (but still in English instead of Swedish). British screenwriter Steven Knight (Eastern Promises, Pawn Sacrifice) is now in talks to adapt The Girl in the Spider’s Web.Fresh Developments This Week1. ARE YOU READY THE ANSWER TO THE CALL OF DUTY CINEMATIC UNIVERSE?One of the biggest trends in film development the last several years (but especially since the success of Marvel’s The Avengers) has been the notion of the “cinematic universe,” connecting various movies and characters together in one franchise. In addition to the comic book franchises from Marvel and WB/DC (in the works), there are also cinematic universe plans for Transformers, LEGO, the Universal Monsters, Godzilla and King Kong, and the various members of the Robin Hood supporting cast. And today, at their annual BlizzCon convention, the video game company Activision Blizzard announced plans for their own such universe, namely&nbsp;for their popular Call of Duty first-person-shooter franchise. The plan is for the first Call of Duty movie to be released in 2018 or 2019 and to be connected to TV shows set within the same world. The company is also working on a Skylanders TV series. It’s unclear if this new studio will be actively involved with the Warcraft movie franchise that is just beginning at Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures. There were also no details as to whether the Call of Duty movies will be set in World War II or in the contemporary settings of the Modern Warfare games.2. PAUL RUDD AND ALEXANDER SKARSGARD WILL BE MUTEOn June 10, 2016, Universal Pictures will release the video game adaptation Warcraft, which is also the third feature film from director Duncan Jones (after Moon and Source Code). In something of a “one for them, one for me,” Duncan Jones has long planned for his fourth film after Warcraft to be one of his own, a “science fiction Casablanca” futuristic drama called Mute. At one time, Jones had expected to reunite with Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role, but this week, we found out that the role will instead go to Alexander Skarsgard (HBO’s True Blood). Skarsgard will play a mute bartender in the Berlin of forty years from now, who must search for his missing love in the city’s strange “underbelly.” Paul Rudd will play an American surgeon who is (or appears to be) part of the disappearance mystery. By the time Mute is released, Alexander Skarsgard will have starred in his biggest movie to date, Warner Bros’ ambitious reboot of Tarzan (7/1/16).3.&nbsp;KEY &amp; PEELE TO WORK WITH STOP-MOTION ANIMATOR HENRY SELICK AS WENDELL &amp; WILDNow that their Comedy Central show Key &amp; Peele has wrapped (the final episode of 53 aired on September 9, 2015), comedians Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are continuing to expand their presence into feature films. This includes their upcoming comedy Keanu (4/22/16), and Jordan Peele’s directorial debut, the horror film Get Out. Their&nbsp;next big project&nbsp;together will unite them with director Henry Selick in a movie called Wendell &amp;&nbsp; Wild. Selick is best known for his work in stop-motion animation movies like The Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, and Coraline. Key and Peele will play the title characters, “scheming demon brothers who must face their arch-nemesis, the demon-dusting nun Sister Helly, and her two acolytes, the goth teens Kat and Raoul.” Wendell &amp; Wild is just one of the projects Selick is currently working on, and given the time needed to deliver stop-motion animation, we’re probably several years from its release. A movie that we are much closer to seeing in theaters is Jordan Peele’s directorial debut, the horror thriller Get Out, which this week cast its female lead, Allison Williams (HBO’s Girls), in what is being described as her feature film debut.&nbsp; (Allison Williams did costar in the 2014 indie musical College Musical).4.&nbsp;STARS LINE UP FOR PRIMER DIRECTOR’S NEXT, THE MODERN OCEANDirector Shane Carruth&nbsp;made his debut in 2004 with the indie sci-fi time travel drama Primer (on a budget of just $7,000!), and followed it up in 2013 with Upstream Color. In addition to complex storylines, both films lacked any traditional “name stars.” That’s all set to change with Shane Carruth’s third film, The Modern Ocean. The impressive names that are now attached to star in The Modern Ocean include Anne Hathaway, Keanu Reeves, Daniel Radcliffe, Asa Butterfield, Jeff Goldblum, Chloe Grace Moretz, Abraham Attah, and Tom Holland. In other words, Shane Carruth is going from working with unknowns to casting Harry Potter, Catwoman, Neo from The Matrix, the next Spider-Man, one of the stars of Jurassic Park, and the two young stars of Martin Scorsese’s Hugo (one of whom was also “Hit-Girl”). Described as a “nautical thriller,” The Modern Ocean promises to “draw audiences in to a secretive world filled with mysterious technologies and bitter rivalries.”&nbsp;The Modern Ocean is currently being shopped to distributors at the American Film Market (like many of the movies reported on this week).5. NICOLE KIDMAN CAST AS AN AMAZON IN WONDER WOMANWarner Bros’ next big DC Comics movie after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (3/25/16) and Suicide Squad (8/5/16) will be Wonder Woman (6/23/17), so it’s going to be time soon for that film to start production. We’ve known for a while that Gal Gadot and Chris Pine would star in Wonder Woman as the title character and her romantic interest Steve Trevor. This week, however, we learned that Nicole Kidman is also in talks to join the cast as “a high-ranking Amazonian warrior.” There have been a lot of Amazons among Wonder Woman’s supporting cast in the last 70+ years of her publication, but the character that has inspired the most speculation from that hint is Hippolyta. In addition to being the Queen of the Amazons of Themiscyra, Hippolyta is also the mother of Prince Diana (AKA Wonder Woman). Hippolyta has even been depicted as herself being the original Wonder Woman during her World War II adventures, though it’s unclear if that could also happen in this live action film. We don’t know yet who the villain of the Wonder Woman movie will be, and there are candidates from the realm of Greek Mythology (like Ares, but also other Amazons). When we learn more about the story, that may give us more information about Nicole Kidman’s character.&nbsp;Wonder Woman will be director Patty Jenkins’ second feature film after making her debut 11 years ago with 2004’s Monster.6.&nbsp;LIAM NEESON TO STAR AS “DEEP THROAT” IN THE WATERGATE BIOPIC FELTThe next movie from director Peter Landesman (Parkland, Kill the Messenger), the football injury drama Concussion (starring Will Smith) doesn’t open until December 25th, but Landesman is already lining up his next fact-based film. (Parkland was about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and Kill the Messenger was about journalist Gary Webb.) Liam Neeson is in talks to star in the biopic Felt as Watergate informant Mark Felt, who for decades was best known to the public by the codename “Deep Throat.” Diane Lane is also in talks to join Liam Neeson as Felt’s wife Audrey. During the years 1972 to 1974, Mark Felt was the Assistant Director of the FBI, and provided information to Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.&nbsp;Filming is scheduled to start in March, 2016 on what is being described as a “spy thriller.”&nbsp;Felt is being backed by an impressive array of producers who include Ridley Scott, Tom Hanks, and Jay Roach.&nbsp; Liam Neeson also recently signed to star in another thriller called The Commuter, which will be distributed by Lionsgate.7. VIDEO GAME ADAPTATION THE WITCHER ON THE HUNT FOR 2017 RELEASEThis is indeed a big week for news about video game adaptation movies. Plans for an adaptation of the Polish fantasy RPG series The Witcher were also announced this week. Itself an adaptation of a series of fantasy novels, The Witcher (and its sequel games) follows the adventures of Gerald of Rivia, a genetically altered agent who works between and with the various factions of the fantasy world he lives in. The Witcher will be produced by the Sean Daniel Company, which has in the past worked with Universal Pictures on The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, and The Best Man Holiday, and also is currently producing the Ben-Hur reboot and The Best Man Wedding for 2016.&nbsp;The Witcher will be directed by newcomer Polish director Tomasz Baginski, with a release target set for sometime in 2017.8.&nbsp;MEL BROOKS AND FRIENDS TO VOICE ANIMATED SPOOF BLAZING SAMURAILast year marked the 40th anniversary of the groundbreaking cowboy spoof comedy Blazing Saddles.&nbsp;In the decades since, the spoof comedy as a sub-genre went on to great success, and then sort of faded away again. Earlier this year, Open Road Films acquired the rights to an animated family film called Blazing Samurai, which will loosely be based on Blazing Saddles, and is now scheduled for April 14, 2017. This week, we learned about some of the actors and celebrities who will be contributing their voices to Blazing Samurai. The lead character will be a dog voiced by Michael Cera, who “longs to become a great warrior and fights to save the town of Kakamucho from becoming the litter box of a nefarious feline warlord, transforming society and himself on his quest to become a true samurai.” Samuel L. Jackson will voice “a cat who once was a great warrior who now lives life hitting the cat-nip a bit too hard” who becomes a mentor for Cera’s dog character. Ricky Gervais will provide the voice of that aforementioned feline warlord, named Ika Chu. Mel Brooks, who directed and cowrote Blazing Saddles, will also voice a character. Other voice actors will include Djimon Hounsou, Gabriel Iglesias, Aasif Mandvi, George Takei, and Michelle Yeoh.&nbsp;Blazing Samurai will mark the feature film directorial debuts of animators Chris Bailey&nbsp;and Mark Koetsier, who previously worked on such films as The Lion King (Koetsier was Scar’s animator), Pocahontas, Tarzan, and Kung Fu Panda.&nbsp;Blazing Samurai is being produced by Rob Minkoff, whose filmography as director includes such films as The Lion King, Stuart Little, and Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman.Rotten Idea of The Week1. ICE CUBE REPLACES CHRIS PRATT IN VACATION FRIENDSIn March, 2014, 20th Century Fox acquired a comedy spec script called Vacation Friends, with the idea that the married couple team of Chris Pratt and Anna Faris would play one of the movie’s two couples. Vacation Friends is about two couples that meet while vacationing in Mexico, and the What About Bob? situation that happens when one of the pairs wants to keep being friends after they all get home. That, however, was 4 months before Guardians of the Galaxy became the #3 movie of 2014, and 15 months before Jurassic World became the #1 movie of 2015 (so far). Since then, Mr. and Mrs. Pratt have moved on to other projects. So, 20th Century Fox is now looking to retool Vacation Friends, and the way they are doing that is by having writer/director Steve Pink do a rewrite. Chris Pratt’s replacement will now be Ice Cube, and the studio is still looking for a female costar to play his wife. It’s not Ice Cube’s involvement, however, that is why we’re calling this a “Rotten Idea.” It’s because two of director Steve Pink’s three movies to date&nbsp;have Rotten Tomatometer scores (Accepted and Hot Tub Time Machine 2), while the only Fresh credit he has is the first Hot Tub Time Machine.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Returns, Crackle, Pixar, Peacock, thriller, TBS, The, league, Vudu, CW, Paramount, the, Freeform, Witch","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/06174509/WinehouseRapace1.jpg","slug":"noomi-rapace-will-star-in-an-amy-winehouse-biopic-call-of-duty-gets-a-movie-and-more-hollywood-headlines"},{"id":"47509196306892","title":"Sandra Bullock Will Star In An All-Female Ocean’s Eleven Reboot","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sandra Bullock Will Star In An All-Female Ocean's Eleven RebootPlus, Martin Scorsese adds a biopic to his slate, Edgar Wright teams up with Johnny Depp, Disney's Zootopia casts up, and more movie news.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 30, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup recaps for you ten headlines from the world of film development. Among the movies that made the top news this week were titles like John Wick 2, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and new film projects for directors George Clooney, Edgar Wright, and Martin Scorsese.This Week’s Top StorySANDRA BULLOCK TO LEAD AN ALL-FEMALE REBOOT OF OCEAN’S ELEVENIf you’ve heard one thing about this week’s new Sandra Bullock movie Our Brand is Crisis, it’s probably that the movie’s lead was originally intended to be male, played by Bullock’s Gravity co-star George Clooney. This week, as the publicity for that film ramped up, we learned of another higher profile project in which Clooney and Bullock will gender swap a character again. In what appears to have been in development for a while now, Sandra Bullock is now reportedly attached to star in the fifth* Ocean’s Eleven movie, in what will be an all-female version of that franchise’s band-of-casino-robbing-rapscallions central motif. (*following the three Clooney/Pitt/Damon films, and the original 1960 Rat Pack movie.) The Bullock-led reboot got its start last year as a collaboration between Clooney and producer Jerry Weintraub. Their first step was to hire screenwriter Olivia Milch, who is also working on a new adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women. The new Ocean’s Eleven also already has a director, Gary Ross, who is best known for directing The Hunger Games (but not the sequels), as well as Pleasantville, Seabiscuit, and next year’s Civil War drama The Free State of Jones, starring Matthew McConaughey. The next step, presumably, for Clooney and Weintraub is to start recruiting 10 female costars to join Sandra Bullock’s version of Danny (Danielle?) Ocean. The resulting publicity that will come from such an exhaustive casting process is probably why the secrecy about this reboot finally had to be lifted this week.Fresh Developments This Week1. MARTIN SCORSESE WANTED FOR LEONARD BERNSTEIN BIOPICAs the orchestral form we call “classical music” progressed through the 20th Century, it was probably inevitable that there would emerge composers who also worked in film. The movies became for a new age what opera and stage musicals were in the past, and classical composers contributed to both of those forms. One of the key figures in the marriage between orchestration and film composing was Leonard Bernstein&nbsp;(1918-1990), whose credits included West Side Story, Peter Pan, and On the Waterfront. This week, as part of a larger story about Paramount Pictures wishing to continue their relationship with director Martin Scorsese, the world learned of plans for a Leonard Bernstein biopic. Paramount’s Leonard Bernstein biopic is just one of the films waiting its turn on Martin Scorsese’s slate as director, along with their adaptation of The Devil in the White City (in which Leonardo DiCaprio will play serial killer H.H. Holmes) and the Pacino/De Niro/Pesci hitman drama The Irishman. Earlier this year, Scorsese wrapped his next film, the Christian-missionaries-in-Japan drama, Silence. That film, featuring Liam Neeson, Adam Driver, and Andrew Garfield, is expected to be released by Paramount in the fall of 2016 as one of the studio’s best hopes for next year’s awards season.2.&nbsp;EDGAR WRIGHT AND JOHNNY DEPP MAY TEAM UP FOR FORTUNATELY, THE MILKWhen the children’s book Fortunately, the Milk was first published last year, some comic book fans were probably quite excited that the fantastic story about a father’s trip to the grocery store was the result of two popular figures working together. The book was written by Sandman creator Neil Gaiman (who movie fans may know because of 2006’s Stardust), and illustrated by Skottie Young, a frequent Marvel Comics contributor whose artistic style arguably continues what Bill Watterson started with Calvin and Hobbes (but with superheroes). Well, if you thought the book was a creative marriage, wait until you read about the movie! 20th Century Fox is in early negotiations to bring together Johnny Depp, director Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead), and screenwriter Brett McKenzie (Flight of the Conchords) for their film adaptation of Fortunately, the Milk. The movie, if it all comes together, will be a live-action/animation hybrid, with the animation being handled by Animal Logic Entertainment, the same company that produced The LEGO Movie. Edgar Wright’s next film as director will be the currently filming crime/racing movie Baby Driver (3/17/17), starring Ansel Elgort (The Fault in Our Stars), Jon Hamm, and Jamie Foxx.3.&nbsp;OLDBOY COSTAR POM KLEMENTIEFF JOINS GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2Some comic book superheroes have survived decades of continuity with remarkably unconvoluted back stories, such as Captain America and Superman (examples of the opposite include Batman, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and the X-Men). And it’s not always the very popular characters whose stories are so twisted around over the years (go ask Hawkman!). Sometimes in the interest of revitalizing a character that didn’t immediately take off, creators try to reinvent them, but if those experiments don’t work out, the character isn’t necessarily improved. But, we may be getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s start with the news that the first new cast member for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and the result of a long casting search, is Canadian actress Pom Klementieff, whose cultural background is Korean and French-Russian. Klementieff landed the role of a “mystery” Asian character, which informed fans were quick to guess (and has now probably been confirmed) to be Marvel’s Mantis. First introduced in Avengers #112 in 1973, Mantis became a short-time member of that team, before migrating to Marvel’s cosmic titles. In the last ten years, Mantis has gone on to become a member of the same reboot of Guardians of the Galaxy that inspired the five initial members as seen in last year’s movie (which was a distillation of a much larger group of characters).&nbsp; Mantis’ extended story also has connections to other figures that are expected to be part of Marvel’s cosmic future, including Adam Warlock, the Kree Empire, and Thanos. Pom Klementieff may become a much better known actress after this sequel, but right now, she’s best known for playing the woman with the yellow umbrella in Spike Lee’s remake of Oldboy. In other related news, Variety‘s reporting of Klementieff’s casting also snuck in the little nugget that Matthew McConaughey had been wanted for the (still mystery) role of the film’s villain, but McConaughey passed. (And we’ll just make our prediction now that the role McConaughey turned down may have been the aforementioned Adam Warlock, who was one of the first movie’s “Easter Eggs.”) Marvel Studios has scheduled Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 for May 5, 2017.4.&nbsp;COMMON JOINS KEANU REEVES AS THE MAIN VILLAIN IN JOHN WICK 2Not a whole lot of the bad guys survived last year’s John Wick, so when a sequel was announced, it was somewhat inevitable that a new batch of villains would need to be cast. We now know that the role of the main villain in John Wick 2, described as “the head of security for a female crime lord,” will be played by rapper-turned-actor Common. Keanu Reeves will (obviously) be returning for the sequel, along with Ian McShane as Winston, the proprietor at the hotel that caters to assassins. The first John Wick was codirected by stunt coordinators Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, in their directorial debuts, but this time, Stahelski will be going solo.5.&nbsp;GEORGE CLOONEY MAY DIRECT THE COEN BROTHERS’ NOIR SUBURBICONWriter-directors Joel and Ethan Coen frequently cast from the same group of recurring cast members, and one of their biggest stars has been George Clooney. As of next year, Clooney will have appeared in four of the Coens’ films: O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Intolerable Cruelty, Burn After Reading, and 2016’s Hail, Caesar!&nbsp;If this week’s deal goes through, however, Clooney and the Coens will do a bit of a switcheroo. That’s because George Clooney is now in talks with TriStar Pictures to direct a film noir&nbsp;called Suburbicon, which was written several years ago by the Coen Brothers. Not much is known about Suburbicon, except that it is a crime drama set in the 1950s, and that it has been compared to the Coens’ first film, Blood Simple. It’s also unknown if George Clooney will also star in the movie, or if he will just direct.&nbsp; (George Clooney has indeed at least costarred in the five movies to date that he has directed).6.&nbsp;IDRIS ELBA LEADS NEW GROUP OF VOICE CAST FOR DISNEY’S ZOOTOPIAWith just five months remaining until the March 4, 2016 release of Walt Disney Animation’s next film, Zootopia, the studio is now starting to gear up its formidable publicity resources in getting word out about what appears to be an ambitious comedy fantasy.&nbsp;Zootopia is set in a world where animals of all types live together, without the apparent involvement of humans. We’ve already known that some of the key voices would be provided by Jason Bateman (Arrested Development), Ginnifer Goodwin (Once Upon a Time), Alan Tudyk (Serenity), and pop star Shakira. This week, the list expanded considerably. Idris Elba will play a cape buffalo chief of police, J.K. Simmons will voice the lion mayor of Zootopia, and Jenny Slate will voice his sheep assistant mayor. Tommy Chung will voice a yak, Octavia Spencer will voice an otter, and other roles will be voiced by Jesse Corti, John DiMaggio, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Katie Lowes, Raymond Persi, Tommy “Tiny” Lister, and Nate Torrence. Zootopia is being co-directed by Rich Moore (Wreck-It Ralph) and Byron Howard (co-director of Bolt and Tangled).7.&nbsp;ROONEY MARA AND NICHOLAS HOULT JOIN SCI-FI ROMANCE THE DISCOVERY2015 has been a big year for both Nicholas Hoult and Rooney Mara, and this week’s story will reunite both in a science fiction romance. Nicholas Hoult has appeared in four movies, including Mad Max: Fury Road, and he has spent the year filming another four, including next summer’s X-Men: Apocalypse. Rooney Mara costarred as Tiger Lily in Pan, costars in the awards contender Carol, and has five other movies in the works for 2016. The movie that will be bringing Hoult and Mara together on screen is called The Discovery, and the title subject is scientific confirmation that the afterlife does in fact exist. Hoult will play the son of the man who makes the discovery (that role isn’t cast yet), and Rooney Mara will play Hoult’s romantic interest, who is herself dealing with a tragic past (best guess: her former romantic interest is one of the aforementioned inhabitants of the Great Hereafter).&nbsp;The Discovery will be the second film for director Charlie McDowell, who made his debut with the “Certified Fresh” film, The One I Love.8.&nbsp;JUST IN TIME FOR HALLOWEEN, DISNEY PLANS TOWER OF TERROR MOVIEIt has now been twelve years since Pirates of the Caribbean became one of Walt Disney Pictures’ most successful live action movie franchises. In that time, Disney has put several other movies based on their theme park attractions into development, including such possible movies as Jungle Cruise, The Magic Kingdom, Space Mountain, a remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and a remake of The Haunted Mansion. The only such movie to actually get released in the last 10 years, however, was this year’s Tomorrowland. Earning just $208 million globally from a budget of $190 million, Tomorrowland is perceived as a box office disappointment, but that isn’t stopping Disney from continuing to develop other movies based on their theme park attractions. The latest example comes to us just in time for Halloween, because Disney is now working on a new feature film&nbsp;based on the Tower of Terror attraction. Also called The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, the ride is basically a fancy version of a classic “drop ride,” which stimulates the danger of falling from a great height. Screenwriter John August, best known for his frequent collaborations with director Tim Burton (such as Frankenweenie, Big Fish, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) is working on the new Tower of Terror screenplay.&nbsp;Tower of Terror was previously adapted as a 1997 TV movie starring Steve Guttenberg and Kirsten Dunst.Rotten Idea of The Week1. DISTRICT 9 DIRECTOR ANNOUNCES DELAYS FOR HIS WOULD-BE ALIEN SEQUELEarly this year, Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium) thrilled his fans with the news that he was working on a fifth entry in the Alien franchise, which would continue Ellen Ripley’s story, bringing Sigourney Weaver back to the science fiction/horror franchise. That, however, was also before Blomkamp’s next film Chappie was released to disappointing box office and reviews. That was also before the world knew that 20th Century Fox would be calling Ridley Scott’s Prometheus sequel Alien: Paradise Lost, officially connecting the prequels with the Alien franchise (though the appearance of a certain xenomorph in the final moments of Prometheus sort of already did that). Through these past months, Neill Blomkamp has been stoking the flames for his movie, effectively Alien 5, including concept art of Ripley and other characters. This week, however, Blomkamp announced through his Twitter account that his Alien film is “kinda holding/pending,” and it’s directly because of Ridley Scott’s Prometheus sequel. This news surely disappoints some fans of both Alien and Neill Blomkamp, but for the director’s fans, it may end up being good news in disguise. Perhaps now Blomkamp can turn to sequelizing one of his own films (District 10 being the most obvious possibility). In somewhat related news, Sigourney Weaver made headlines this week because she will be costarring with Michelle Rodriguez in an action movie called Tomboy. Rodriguez will play “an ace assassin who is double-crossed by gangsters and falls into the hands of rogue surgeon known as “The Doctor,” who turns him into a woman. The hitman (now a hitwoman) sets out for revenge, aided by a nurse named Johnnie, who also has secrets.”&nbsp;Tomboy will be directed by Walter Hill, the director of such films as 48 Hrs, The Warriors, Undisputed, and Bullet to the Head. But the thing that really connects Tomboy to Blomkamp’s news is that Walter Hill is also one of the producers of the Alien franchise, having worked in that capacity on every film all the way back to 1979’s Alien.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"jamie, OneApp, movie, Hulu, CNN, Films","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/30163748/SandraBullockOceansKetchup.jpg","slug":"sandra-bullock-will-star-in-an-all-female-oceans-eleven-reboot"},{"id":"47509196300745","title":"Star Wars Is the Ultimate Forever Franchise and More Hollywood Headlines","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Star Wars Is the Ultimate Forever Franchise and More Hollywood HeadlinesNew roles for Emma Stone, Oscar Isaac, Bill Hader, and Joaquin Phoenix, plus Vin Diesel teases Fast and Furious spinoffs.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 20, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings another ten hot headlines from the film industry’s development cycle, representing the last seven days. Included in the mix this time around are stories about such films as The Dark Tower, Justice League Dark, Top Gun 2, the various Fast and Furious and Star Wars future movies, and… a remake of Memento?This Week’s Top StoryWILL STAR WARS BECOME THE ULTIMATE FOREVER FRANCHISE?As the media juggernaut that is Star Wars: The Force Awakens continues to near its release (on 12/18/15), Wired published a story that posed an intriguing question. As Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Pictures commits to a movie-a-year schedule with no end in sight, is Star Wars a “forever franchise?” That appears to be what producer Kathleen Kennedy is committed to seeing implemented in the years and decades to come. As Adam Rogers of Wired put it, “If everything works out for Disney, and if you are (like me) old enough to have been conscious for the first Star Wars film, you will probably not live to see the last one. It’s the forever franchise.”&nbsp;Star Wars is obviously not the only popular film franchise, as the superhero cinematic universes of both Marvel and DC Comics are popular box office draws. What separates Star Wars however, is that unlike any other extended film franchise, it&nbsp;continues to exist in the same universe that was first created in 1977. In contrast, Batman will soon be in his third cinematic “universe” within the last 20 years (the 1989-1997 franchise, the three Nolan films, and next, Ben Affleck’s version). Over at Marvel, although Marvel Studios’ is having success with their “MCU,” some of their characters remain at 20th Century Fox, fracturing Marvel’s cinematic identity in a way that has never happened with Star Wars. Past Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Lucasfilm’s future plans include the prequel Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (12/16/16),&nbsp; Star Wars Episode VIII (title likely to change) (5/26/17), a similar prequel for Han Solo (5/25/18), Star Wars Episode IX (2019), and possible future solo films for Boba Fett, Yoda, and maybe even characters we haven’t even met yet.Fresh Developments This Week1. VIN DIESEL DEVELOPING FAST AND FURIOUS SPINOFFS AND PREQUELSAs you could guess by the title, this year’s Furious 7 was the sixth sequel to The Fast and the Furious, and it’s been known for a while that Universal Pictures has plans for at least another three sequels. (Trivia: The first film was originally to be called Racer X, which is worth remembering as Fast and the Furious movie “X” gets closer). However, as Vin Diesel revealed this week to Variety, there are plans for far more movies featuring Fast and the Furious characters. Specifically, there are tentative plans for both spinoffs and prequels involving the various characters we’ve met in the movies. Vin Diesel said to Variety, “We’ve written out story lines for various characters,” and, “We’ve been playing with it for a long time. It’s a very rich property and we’re committed to treating it with a lot of class.” Although Vin Diesel did not specify which characters will someday get their own spinoff films, there was talk a few years ago that Dwayne Johnson’s Luke Hobbs might someday receive just such a movie.2.&nbsp;EDGAR WRIGHT TO DIRECT DREAMWORKS ANIMATION’S ME AND MY SHADOWIf you’re one of those people who regularly follows film development news, and have been doing so for a while, you might recall an animated project from a few years ago called Me and My Shadow.&nbsp; The movie first made the news in 2010 as a DreamWorks Animation project that would combine CG and traditional animation in its telling of “Shadow Stan, an incredibly frustrated shadow that yearns for a more dynamic life but happens to be stuck with Stanley Grubb, the world’s most boring human.” In 2010, Me and My Shadow was expected to be released in March of 2013, but obviously, that never happened. Now, a few years later, Me and My Shadow appears to have been given a new chance at actually being released, and it’s via one of online fandom’s most popular directors. Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), who is currently filming his next film, Baby Driver, is now attached to make his feature film debut as an animation director with Me and My Shadow.&nbsp; It’s not yet known if the film will still be a traditional/CGI hybrid, or how far away the film might be from release (but a good guess is that it will be a while yet).3. MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY WANTED FOR THE DARK TOWER… BUT AS WHOM?When major news breaks, different sources are obviously going to cover the same story, but sometimes the details of the stories differ between them. Take, for example, the reports this week about the continuing notion that Matthew McConaughey is wanted to star in a highly-anticipated Stephen King adaptation. Previously, there had been stories that McConaughey was wanted for the role of&nbsp;Randall Flagg in Warner Bros’ The Stand.&nbsp; This week, a similar story broke about Sony Pictures wanting McConaughey to play the villain Walter Padick&nbsp;in The Dark Tower. (Where this can get confusing is that both Padick and Randall Flagg are the same character by different names in different novels.) That story came from Variety, but as The Wrap is reporting the news, it’s that Matthew McConaughey is wanted for The Dark Tower as either Padick or the film’s hero, the gunslinger Roland Deschain. What’s clear in any case is that Matthew McConaughey remains a popular casting choice for all sorts of high profile films. For example, there was the story a few weeks ago that Matthew McConaughey had turned down the villain role in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2.4. EMMA STONE TO STAR IN TEACHER DRAMA LOVE MAY FAILEmma Stone has signed to star in the drama Love May Fail, based upon a novel by author Matthew Quick, the author behind Silver Linings Playbook.&nbsp;Love May Fail is based at TriStar, a division of Sony Pictures, where Emma Stone has frequently worked on such films as Superbad, Zombieland, and the two Amazing Spider-Man movies. Stone will play a woman coming off of a failed marriage who returns to her hometown to help clear the name of her favorite English teacher, who has become embroiled in “a classroom scandal.”&nbsp;Love May Fail doesn’t have a director yet, but the script was adapted by Mike White (Orange County, School of Rock).5.&nbsp;OSCAR ISAAC AND BILL HADER TO STAR IN ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL FOLLOW UPSIt’s not always obvious whether films with thematic connections are covered in the news around the same time for a reason, or if it’s all just a big coincidence. Two examples of that this week are the stories about separate films which are both “next projects” for two of the central figures behind this year’s Sundance hit, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. First off, let’s discuss the film that M&amp;E&amp;TDG director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon is in talks to direct next. That film is called A Foreigner, and Oscar Isaac is in talks with Paramount Pictures to star in it. Isaac would star in this true story of a “a murdered Guatemalan man who has videos of his killers distributed after his death in order to uproot the corruption that led to the death of many others.” You can read more about that story in the original piece as published by The New Yorker. Jesse Andrews, who wrote the book and screenplay of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,&nbsp;is also in the news this week, because he is now set to make his own directorial debut. That film is called Empress of Serenity, and comedian/actor Bill Hader is already attached to star. Loosely based on a story by David Foster Wallace (A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again), the drama will tell the story of a father and son who take an ocean cruise together, on which they attempt to bond over “intimacy issues.” Hader will play the adult son, and an older actor will play his father.6. JOAQUIN PHOENIX AND CASEY AFFLECK TO REUNITE FOR WESTERN FAR BRIGHT STAR(Photo by Kevin Winter / Staff / Getty Images)&nbsp;Joaquin Phoenix and his brother-in-law Casey Affleck (who’s married to Joaquin’s sister) made quite the splash in 2010 with the pseudo-documentary-by-way-of-celebrity-performance-art I’m Still Here (which Affleck directed). Now, Phoenix and Affleck are preparing to reunite again in the same capacities, but on a film that is much more traditional. Casey Affleck will direct Joaquin Phoenix in the western Far Bright Star, adapted from the 2009 novel by Robert Olmstead. Phoenix will play an “aging” cavalryman in 1916 who leads a group hunting down the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. The story takes a dark turn when the group is ambushed, and Phoenix’s character is left to struggle for survival in the desert. Casey Affleck received a 53 percent Rotten score for I’m Still Here, but the scores for Joaquin Phoenix’s dramatic roles (and how unusual that film was) are enough to still keep this story within the “Fresh Developments” category.7. JUSTICE LEAGUE DARK RUMORS: POSSIBLE CAST, POSSIBLE DIRECTORS?As of this writing, only one film in Warner Bros’ new DC Comics universe has been released (2013’s Man of Steel), with two more wrapped and scheduled for 2016 (Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad), and Wonder Woman currently filming for release on June 23, 2017. This week, most of the online attention turned towards another DC Comics super team movie which is rumored to start filming in 2016 for a possible 2018 release date. That movie is called Justice League Dark, and was previously a possible directorial project for Guillermo Del Toro (his script is reportedly still being used). In just one week, we have seen rumors about possible actors for all of the team members and the film’s villain. The first of three such stories suggested that Warner Bros might want Colin Farrell to play John Constantine (AKA Hellblazer), Ewan McGregor as Jason Blood (AKA Etrigan the Demon), Ron Perlman behind the motion-capture of the new Swamp Thing, and Monica Belluci as the sorceress Madame Xanadu. That was followed by a story suggesting that Warner Bros might want Ben Mendelsohn to play the film’s villain, Anton Arcane (who was previously the villain in the first 1980s Swamp Thing movie). Finally, there was also a story this week that the top contenders for the Justice League Dark director job might be either Evil Dead remake director Fede Alvarez, or the directing duo behind 2014’s Big Bad Wolves, Aharon Keshales and Navot Papushado. With so many Justice League Dark stories happening unofficially this week, hopefully, we will soon hear some officially confirmed casting or director news.8.&nbsp;VAL KILMER ANNOUNCES HE WILL RETURN FOR TOP GUN 2Big news stories don’t happen happen like this every week, but occasionally, social media shows off how it has changed the way we receive entertainment news. Usually, as with this story, it’s because an actor or director makes an announcement that might have happened outside the normal publicity channels. (As in, the publicist for the actor or production sends out a story to news sources, or gives a particular one an exclusive story). Nope, instead of all that, Val Kilmer took to his confirmed Facebook account this week to break some big news. Kilmer posted, “I just got offered ‪#‎topgun2 – not often you get to say “yes” without reading the script…” Val Kilmer went on to give other examples that he would say yes to, script unseen (like working with Gene Hackman or Francis Coppola). What wasn’t specified is whether Val Kilmer will be returning in Top Gun 2 as “Iceman,” but some of his comments to his post seemed to suggest that is exactly what’s happening. Previous reports about Top Gun 2 have suggested that the sequel’s premise may involve drone pilots, and how those pilots are different today than the fighter pilots of the 1980s.&nbsp; Top Gun director Tony Scott committed suicide on August 19, 2012, and the director of the sequel has not yet been announced.Rotten Idea of The Week1.&nbsp;CAN WE ALL AGREE TO FORGET THE PLANS FOR A MEMENTO REMAKE?A popular approach to the idea of film remakes is that it’s an approach best taken for films that were flawed the first time around, which suggests that “perfect” films would never have a reason to get the remake treatment. So, when film fans hear about a favorite film in development as a remake or a reboot (or a re-whatever), they are quickly and vocally unhappy. Such was the case this week with the announcement that a new production company called AMBI Pictures has acquired the rights to several independent films, including Christopher Nolan’s 2000 film, Memento, which they plan to remake. Guy Pearce starred in Memento as a man with only very limited memory of his past, so that he has tattooed himself with information and clues, as he drifts through an existence where he is extremely open to manipulation and deception by those around him. Here’s how AMBI’s Andrea Iervolino addressed their plans to remake Memento, “[which] has been consistently ranked as one of the best films of its decade. People who’ve seen Memento 10 times still feel they need to see it one more time. This is a quality we feel really supports and justifies a remake. The bar is set high thanks to the brilliance or [sic] Christopher Nolan, but we wouldn’t want it any other way.” So, the question gets asked once again: Is it worth trying to remake what so many consider a perfect film?","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"based, history, Rocky, Hallmark, Golden, song, Access, Shondaland","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20180409/StarWars.jpg","slug":"star-wars-is-the-ultimate-forever-franchise-and-more-hollywood-headlines"},{"id":"47509196313040","title":"Animated Ghostbusters Movie Is Coming, A Thor: Ragnarok Director is Found, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Animated Ghostbusters Movie Is Coming, A Thor: Ragnarok Director is Found, and More Movie NewsThe Assassin's Creed cast grows, the Terminator franchise is put on hold, and Disney's Enchanted gets a sequel.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 2, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers ten headlines from the realm of film development news that you may have missed in the last seven days.&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories involving such movies as Assassin’s Creed, Thor: Ragnarok, a remake of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and the Enchanted sequel, Disenchanted.This Week’s Top StoryANIMATED GHOSTBUSTERS MOVIE IN THE WORKSIn July, Ghostbusters director/producer Ivan Reitman dismissed stories about a second upcoming Ghostbusters movie featuring action stars like Channing Tatum and Chris Pratt as being “just noise.” Just over two months later, we’re now hearing about another new Ghostbusters movie&nbsp; (after next year’s female-led reboot, scheduled for 7/15/16).&nbsp; And possibly ironically, this new movie will also be produced by Ivan Reitman. The movie in question will be an animated Ghostbusters movie, although no other details are known about it.&nbsp; There was previously an animated show from 1986 to 1991 called The Real Ghostbusters which was an adaptation of the original cast, featuring the characters played in live-action by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Harold Ramis. &nbsp;In that case, the show had to be called The Real Ghostbusters because there had already been a cartoon show called Ghostbusters (which was itself based upon the 1970s kids TV show starring Larry Storch).&nbsp; This news about an animated Ghostbusters movie follows news earlier this year that Sony is also developing an animated Spider-Man movie to follow their live-action reboot scheduled for July 28, 2017.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS… OF ASGARD?Although it’s obviously not always true, Marvel Studios has established something of a pattern of frequently taking chances with new-ish directors, or directors whose filmographies don’t necessarily scream out “Make Mine Marvel!”&nbsp; We’re including in that list Kenneth Branagh (Thor), Shane Black (Iron Man 3), Alan Taylor (Thor: The Dark World), and the Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier). For this week’s news, it’s obviously of note that two of those films were the first two Thor movies, which were directed by Branagh (best known for Shakespeare adaptations) and Alan Taylor (a Game of Thrones director who had never directed a major studio film with a huge budget). Marvel Studios is going to try something similar again with Thor: Ragnarok (11/3/17), because they are now in talks with a relative newcomer named Taika Waititi. Taika Waititi cowrote, codirected and costarred in this year’s vampire/horror/comedy indie hit What We Do in the Shadows along with Jemaine Clement. Other directors that Marvel had been considering for Thor: Ragnarok included Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland), Rob Letterman (Monsters vs Aliens), and Rawson Marshall Thurber (We’re the Millers), which suggests Marvel was intentionally seeking out a director with a record of successfully directing a comedy.&nbsp; Will Thor: Ragnarok be more comedic than the title suggests, or does Marvel just think comedy directors are a good fit for their films in general?2.&nbsp;JEREMY IRONS AND BRENDAN GLEESON CAST AS DADS IN ASSASSIN’S CREEDAs people continue to bemoan how many superhero movies there are, there also remains a vast untapped resource of potential video game adaptations, partly because in a way, modern video games sort of are interactive films.&nbsp; The reason they are untapped, of course, is that video game adaptation movies don’t have a great track record, either financially or critically. The search is still ongoing, however, for the movie that might someday turn things around. Two such movies are scheduled for next year. Universal and Legendary Pictures have Warcraft (6/10/16), and 20th Century Fox has Assassin’s Creed (12/21/16). Michael Fassbender has been attached as the lead for Assassin’s Creed for some time, and Marion Cotillard is the female lead. This week, we learned that two acclaimed actors are going to be playing their characters’ fathers. Jeremy Irons will play Cotillard’s father, and Brendan Gleeson will play Michael Fassbender’s character’s father.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard also star together in this year’s newest film version of William Shakespeare’s MacBeth, which was directed by Justin Kurzel, who is also directing Assassin’s Creed.3. I AM PILGRIM, AND ALSO A NEW SPY MOVIE FOR KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE DIRECTORAlthough Matthew Vaughn is best known for having directed superhero movies based on comic books (Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class), this year, Vaughn had another hit with a movie which was “only” based on a comic book. That film was Kingsman: The Secret Service, the subtitle of which was the title of the Mark Millar comic book it was based upon. This week, we found out that Matthew Vaughn’s next film will indeed have something in common with his last, but it won’t be the comic book part. Matthew Vaughn has signed on with MGM to direct their adaptation of &nbsp;I Am Pilgrim, a 2014 best selling espionage thriller novel written by Terry Hayes. Filming is expected to start in 2016 on the movie, which is about a retired espionage leader who is called back to service “to lend his expertise to an unusual investigation but ultimately becomes caught in a terrifying race against time to save America from a cunning terrorist.”4. TERMINATOR: GENISYS SEQUELS “ON HOLD INDEFINITELY”The downside to Hollywood sometimes announcing multiple films in a franchise simultaneously is that their corporate optimism about the first film sometimes backfires. One recent example of this was the Fantastic Four reboot, a sequel to which seems a lot less likely now that the film was both a critical and box office flop. Another franchise in a similar predicament is Terminator, which also released a new entry this past summer in the form of Terminator: Genisys. Like Fantastic Four, Terminator: Genisys was announced along with planned sequels (specifically a new trilogy). However, the reviews for Terminator: Genisys were slightly better (26% Rotten instead of just 9%), and the film did better box office in China than it did in the USA. This week, however, we learned, in something of a buried lead (in an article about the perils of franchise building) that “the $150 million-plus movie still will lose money, and sources say the notion of a Terminator universe is on hold indefinitely.” We’re calling this a “Fresh Development” based on the Rotten Tomatometer score for Terminator: Genisys, because the implication is that further Terminator movies not being produced is something of a dodged bullet. Or a time travel alternate reality course correction, if you prefer your analogies very on-the-nose.Rotten Ideas of The Week5.&nbsp;JOAQUIN PHOENIX OUT, JAMES MCVOY IN, FOR SHYAMALAN’S NEXTLast month, some were surprised by the news that Joaquin Phoenix was going to reunite with director M. Night Shyamalan for a mystery film that is going to start filming in Pennsylvania next month. This was to have been their third film working together, after Signs and The Village, back in the early 2000s. Although we don’t know exactly why, this week, we learned that the deal for Joaquin Phoenix eventually fell apart, and he is now being replaced. (This was actually the second reason Phoenix made the news this week, with the first being the various “Hurricane Joaquin” memes).&nbsp; The actor now in talks to replace Joaquin Phoenix is James McAvoy, AKA the young Professor Xavier of the recent X-Men films. And we still don’t know anything else about the film, except that the budget is reportedly being kept relatively low (something like the $5 million of The Visit). Whether that’s also part of why Joaquin Phoenix dropped out is also unknown.4.&nbsp;GEORGE R.R. MARTIN DEBUNKS THAT NEWS ABOUT A GAME OF THRONES MOVIE(Photo by Kevin Winter / Staff / Getty Images)If you looked at your Facebook/Twitter/etc. this week, there’s a good chance you saw at least a few posts about author George R.R. Martin announcing a Game of Thrones big screen movie. Some of the original sources have already gone offline, but you can find a nice summary of them right here. Basically, the quotes (which claimed to be from George R.R. Martin) said that there will be a HBO Game of Thrones movie, but without Martin’s involvement. There was also a statement that some of the movie would be set in the past. We’re not getting into too many details, because George R.R. Martin quickly debunked the entire story. Replying in a comment on his own LiveJournal, addressed a question about a “Robert’s Rebellion” movie by saying, “Yes, completely false. No one is working on any movie just now. And if there was a movie, it would not be about Robert’s Rebellion.”3.&nbsp;DISNEY STILL WORKING ON ENCHANTED SEQUEL, NOW CALLED DISENCHANTEDNext month will mark the eighth anniversary of the release of Disney’s family comedy Enchanted, about a fairy tale princess (Amy Adams) who finds herself in the “real world.” Despite that film’s $340 box office earnings, the sequel has not yet happened as quickly as one might have expected. Following recent disappointments with non-Marvel/Lucasfilm live action films like John Carter, Tomorrowland, and the decision to cancel a third TRON movie, Disney’s focus seems to be on live action movies closer to their “animation remakes.” The sequel to Enchanted fits right in with those films, and so that’s probably we’re hearing this week that Disney is still committed to making that film happen. This news also comes with a new title for the sequel, which is now being called Disenchanted. Not much else is known (including how many, if any, of the first film’s stars will return), except that Disenchanted will be directed by Anne Fletcher (The Proposal, Hot Pursuit).&nbsp; Unfortunately, Anne Fletcher’s filmography as director is 100 percent Rotten.2.&nbsp;FAST &amp; FURIOUS 8 CAUGHT IN TRAFFIC OVER SEARCH FOR DIRECTORSoon after the successful release of Furious 7, Universal Pictures enlisted star Vin Diesel to help announce a release date of April 14, 2017 for the eighth movie in the franchise. That’s a release date that is now just over 18 months away, and the sequel still doesn’t have a director yet, which was behind a few different news stories this week (and also last week, starting with this piece). First, Vin Diesel appeared to be recruiting fan support online for the notion that the director of the very first Fast and the Furious movie, Rob Cohen, should return for #8. The next day, Vin Diesel posted a lengthy story to his Facebook account, which included this statement, “I will share something crazy that my mother said six months ago after the studio had me announce the date for 8 to the world… “ Either you direct 8 yourself… or don’t do it.”&nbsp; Vin Diesel made his feature film directorial debut with the 1997 independent film Strays. Following that post, there was a report that Universal wasn’t “happy with Diesel’s post, or the notion that he might direct. ‘It is never going to happen,’ says the insider.”&nbsp; We’re calling all of this a “Rotten Idea” in total, because of the implied impact it might have on us getting&nbsp;another great Fast and Furious movie anytime soon, following positive reactions to Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6, and Furious 7.1. WHEN THE LEGEND BECOMES FACT, REMAKE… THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCEDirector John Ford’s 1962 western/frontier drama The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was named #47 on the BBC’s list of the 100 Greatest American Films, along with other placements on various “best of all time” film lists. The film&nbsp;is also Certified Fresh with a Tomatometer score of 93 percent. So, in Hollywood’s fine tradition of not letting great old films remain untarnished, the news broke this week that Paramount Pictures is developing a remake of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. John Wayne and James Stewart starred in the drama as a cowboy and a small town frontier lawyer who team up to take down an outlaw named Liberty Valance (played by Lee Marvin). (John Wayne calling Stewart “Pilgrim” also became one of his most iconic film scenes.) Part of the allure of the original film was that Wayne and Stewart were two of Hollywood’s biggest stars, so one might presume that Paramount might attempt similar casting with two of today’s stars. For example, Tom Cruise has a long history of working with Paramount, and Tom Hanks is often compared to Jimmy Stewart. However, the studio has not yet made any such announcements (this article has other ideas about possible remake stars). Rather than being a Western, the remake may have a more contemporary setting, with the steel towns of Western Pennsylvania in the 1980s given as one example.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Sci-Fi, The, Christmas, Comedy, Video, tv, Christmas, criterion, Network, prank, Games, Marathons","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/AnimatedGhostbusters1.jpg","slug":"animated-ghostbusters-movie-is-coming-a-thor-ragnarok-director-is-found-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509196307917","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Will the Two-Part Harry Potter Play Become a New Movie?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Will the Two-Part Harry Potter Play Become a New Movie?Plus, Dora the Explorer gets a live action adaptation, Wonderland's Queen of Hearts gets her own movie, and more Power Rangers are cast.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 23, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers ten stories from the last seven days in the realm of film development news (the stories about what future movies will get made, and who is behind them).&nbsp; Included in the mix this week are stories about Ant-Man and the Wasp, Dora the Explorer, and Monster High.This Week’s Top StoryQUESTION OF THE WEEK: WILL HARRY POTTER PLAYS BECOME A MOVIE?To some degree, the normal pace of film development news seemed to slow down considerably this week.&nbsp; Focus instead was shifted to first, the final Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer (and the tickets going on sale for the first time).&nbsp; The second big movie news event this week happened on Wednesday, as the future of Back to the Future II, October 21, 2015, became a reality.&nbsp; This column is focused on film development, however (stories about movies actually getting made), and if you remove Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Back to the Future from this week, you’re left with several stories that sort of got lost in people’s newsfeeds. The biggest such story has to be the news that J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter franchise will continue with a new eighth story&nbsp;called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.&nbsp; This time, however, the story will not be told in a novel, but will instead be a two-part play presented on stage in London, starting in the summer of 2016.&nbsp; The focus of this new story will be Harry Potter’s youngest son, Albus, who “must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.” The plays are expected to feature a cast of over 30 characters, though it’s not yet known if any of the film cast will reprise their characters on stage.&nbsp; And finally, since this is a column about movies, it’s also unknown if Warner Bros will be developing movies adapting Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.&nbsp; What is known is that the first Harry Potter spinoff/prequel, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, is currently filming, and is scheduled for release on November 18, 2016.Fresh Developments This Week1. ANT-MAN DIRECTOR TO RETURN FOR THE SEQUEL ANT-MAN AND THE WASPMarvel Studios has been making the news lately about their searches for directors for such movies as Thor: Ragnarok (the job went to Taika Waititi of What We Do in the Shadows), Black Panther, and Captain Marvel (both positions are still yet unhired).&nbsp; Apparently, based upon how relatively quickly it has happened, the decision about who to hire to direct a sequel to Ant-Man was a lot less involved. Peyton Reed, who directed Ant-Man, is now in advanced talks with Marvel Studios to direct the sequel called Ant-Man and the Wasp. Paul Rudd is already signed to return for the sequel, and Evangeline Lilly is also expected to return. Marvel Studios has scheduled Ant-Man and the Wasp for July 6, 2018, which in Marvel’s schedule, places the film in between Avengers: Infinity War Part I (5/4/18) and Captain Marvel (3/8/19). Presuming that Phase 3 will have six films like the first two phases did, those three films may be the first films of Marvel’s (not yet announced) “Phase 4.”&nbsp; Paul Rudd will next appear as Ant-Man in next year’s Captain America: Civil War (5/6/16).2. DORA THE EXPLORER TO GET HER OWN MOVIE (ALONG WITH THE MICRONAUTS)Sometimes, writers reporting the news from the world of film development sort of “bury the lead” by including two fairly big stories (to different audiences, usually) under the same banner.&nbsp; In this case, we found out that Paramount is still developing their Micronauts movie at the same time&nbsp;that we learned of the studio’s plans for a live-action Dora the Explorer movie. Both movies are being adapted by screenwriter Tom Wheeler, who is best known for writing the 2011 hit Puss in Boots. First introduced in 2000, Dora the Explorer has become a very successful mainstream and media-wide franchise which includes TV, books, toys, games, and even stage productions.&nbsp;Micronauts, on the other hand, is a 1970s/1980s science fiction toy and Marvel Comics franchise that has been in development for a “comeback/resurgence” for several years.&nbsp; Micronauts is being developed by Paramount and Hasbro, the same companies that have previously had success bringing back old toy properties with both Transformers and (to a lesser degree) G.I. Joe.3. UNIVERSAL TO GIVE THE QUEEN OF HEARTS HER OWN WICKED-LIKE PREQUELUnder the broader umbrella of live-action adaptations of classic Disney movies, the studio has also been focusing on movies and TV shows that tell the back stories for some of their villains. Examples of this are Maleficent, Oz the Great and Powerful, and the ABC series Once Upon a Time. Of course, the inspiration for some of that arguably has been the Broadway musical Wicked, which is still waiting for its own movie, which Universal Pictures has in development. This week, we learned more about another villain-centric prequel that Universal has in development, and like Wicked, it is based upon a novel (actually, a series of YA novels). Universal Pictures has hired screenwriter Grant Pierce Myers (cowriter of The Maze Runner) to start adapting Colleen Oakes’ Queen of Hearts novels into a feature film.&nbsp; The title character of Queen of Hearts is the teenage princess living in Wonderland Palace who will someday meet a girl named Alice, as depicted in the books by Lewis Carroll. Colleen Oakes has thus far published two Queen of Hearts novels, with the third expected to be published in the summer of 2018 (possibly around the time this movie is released?).4.&nbsp;JOHN F. KENNEDY’S WORLD WAR II EXPERIENCE TO BE ADAPTED AS MAYDAY 109When Senator John F. Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of the core elements to his legacy and reputation was the story of his experience as the commander of the PT-109 patrol boat in the Pacific Theater of World War II. In the early morning of August 2, 1943, PT-109 collided with a much larger Japanese destroyer (the Amagiri), leading to the PT-109 being sunk. John F. Kennedy was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for what happened next. Cliff Robertson starred as JFK in the 1963 movie&nbsp;PT 109 about the incident, but that movie is now over 50 years old. In that spirit, development has now begun on a spec script&nbsp;called Mayday 109, written by relative newcomers Evan Kilgore&nbsp;and Samuel Franco (a former producer for Howard Stern and Charlie Rose).&nbsp; Mayday 109 is being produced by the same producers and production companies that this year delivered Sicario and San Andreas.5. HUGO WEAVING BRINGS HIS VOICE TO MEL GIBSON’S HACKSAW RIDGEFollowing his controversies in 2006 and 2010, Academy Award winner Mel Gibson has continued to work as an actor (The Beaver, The Expendables 3), but the road back to directing has taken longer. Nine years after Apocalypto, Mel Gibson is now back behind the camera in Sydney, Australia, filming a World War II fact-based drama called Hacksaw Ridge. The production is being funded outside the traditional Hollywood studio system&nbsp;(as several of Gibson’s recent projects have been). Australian actor Hugo Weaving, a familiar face and voice to fans of film franchises like The Matrix and Lord of the Rings, signed on this week in a supporting role.&nbsp; Hugo Weaving will play the father of Desmond T. Doss, as played by Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man). Desmond Doss was “the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor and one of only three so honored.”&nbsp; Doss was drafted into service during World War II, and served as a medic in the Pacific theatre.6. SNL ALUM MOLLY SHANNON CAST AS… EMILY DICKINSON?As much as some famous figures from classic literature have been repeatedly and popularly represented in movies (such as William Shakespeare, Ernest Hemingway, and Mark Twain), there are others who seem to have been skipped over.&nbsp; Consider, for example, the legacy of American poet Emily Dickinson. Although she has appeared as a character in some works, Emily Dickinson hasn’t really been the central subject of a major motion picture (to this writer’s knowledge… ever?). This week, the news broke about an independent comedy that is ostensibly aiming to correct that trend a bit. Molly Shannon, who is probably best known for her time on Saturday Night Live (1995 to 2001), recently wrapped filming on an untitled, shrouded-in-mystery “period piece comedy” in which she stars as the adult Emily Dickinson, with her younger version played by relative newcomer Dana Melanie.&nbsp; It’s expected that director Madeleine Olnek&nbsp;(The Foxy Merkins) will be submitting the mystery project to film festivals like Sundance and SXSW for an early 2016 festival premiere.7. JON HAMM JOINS EDGAR WRIGHT’S BABY DRIVERWith Mad Men now done and off the air, star Jon Hamm appears to be turning his attention towards doing more film work.&nbsp; This week, we learned that he has joined the cast of the racing action movie Baby Driver. The movie is itself something of a “next step” project for director Edgar Wright, who previously had been working on Marvel’s Ant-Man, before his departure from that film in 2014. Edgar Wright’s last film as director was The World’s End (8/23/13), and Sony Pictures has scheduled Baby Driver for release on March 17, 2017, up against Disney’s live action remake of Beauty and the Beast.&nbsp; Jon Hamm joins Baby Driver in an unknown role along with Lily James, Jamie Foxx, and Ansel Elgort (The Fault in Our Stars), as the lead character, a young getaway driver who comes into conflict with a dangerous crime boss.8. THE DUFF DIRECTOR TRANSFERS TO MONSTER HIGH(Photo by Dave Kotinsky / Stringer / Getty Images)Sometimes, it feels like film adaptations of toy/game/TV franchises finally get made long after the source material’s peak in popularity (like, say, Jem and the Holograms and The Man from U.N.C.L.E.). In some cases, this is done on purpose to take advantage of nostalgia (again, like&nbsp;Jem and the Holograms). In other examples, the film adaptation actually feels pretty well timed, as the movie comes out while the source is still popular (example: The LEGO Movie). If you browse a toy aisle the next time you go shopping, one of the franchises you will see is Mattel’s Monster High, which features “girl doll” versions of classic Universal monsters like Dracula, The Mummy, The Wolf Man, and Frankenstein’s Monster. And Universal Pictures is taking advantage of that current popularity, with plans for a Monster High movie to be released in about a year, on October 7, 2016. This week, that movie made a crucial next step towards actually happening with the news of the film’s director. That job will go to Ari Sandel, who made his feature film debut earlier this year with The DUFF, another teen film set in a high school (71 percent Tomatometer Score). Before that, Sandel also directed the 2006 short film West Bank Story, which won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. We should start hearing about casting for the various “teenage monsters” soon. Expect lots of I Was a Teenage [INSERT MONSTER HERE] headlines in the near future.Rotten Idea of The Week1. THIS WEEK IN POWER RANGERS: BLACK, RED, AND BLUE RANGERS CASTEach week, as we pick which news stories are “rotten” (usually using RT Tomatometer scores for past films), it can sometimes feel like we keep “beating up” on the same movies, partly because film development news for movies often happen consecutively. So, the movie that was the “Rotten Idea” last week might be the “Rotten Idea” next week too. That, unfortunately, is the case with the new Power Rangers movie. The first Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, back in 1995, has a Rotten score of 50 percent. And the new movie, scheduled for 2017, will be the second film for director Dean Israelite, who made his debut this year with the 34 percent Rotten movie, Project Almanac. Anyway, Power Rangers made the news three times this week, with the casting announcements for the colors Red, Black, and Blue (who are joining the already cast Naomi Scott as the Pink Ranger).&nbsp; The Red Ranger will be played by newcomer Dacre Montgomery, who only two short films to his credit currently.&nbsp;The Black Ranger will be played by Ludi Lin, whose filmography is slightly longer, with an episode of Netflix’s Marco Polo probably having the highest profile.&nbsp; Finally, just today (as we go to press), we have learned that the Blue Ranger will be played by the actor with the highest profile of the four announced thus far.&nbsp;R.J. Cyler was the “Earl” in this past summer’s indie hit, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. This leaves two more main Power Rangers yet to be cast (green and yellow, most likely), along with the film’s villains.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"we, award, Cosplay, e., Unbreakable, Review, on, harry, discovery, Kimmy, Anna","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HarryPotterKetchup.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-will-the-two-part-harry-potter-play-become-a-new-movie"},{"id":"47509197811153","title":"Men In Black Reboots As A Trilogy Without Will Smith, Sicario Gets a Sequel, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Men In Black Reboots As A Trilogy Without Will Smith, Sicario Gets a Sequel, and More Movie NewsNew roles for Benedict Cumberbatch and Jake Gyllenhaal, Emma Stone and Kate Winslet, an action movie about George Washington, and more Ghostbusters sign on for the reboot.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 25, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers ten stories from the arena of film development news. Included in the mix this week are headlines for such movies as the Ghostbusters reboot, The Girl on the Train, and Sicario 2; and new roles for Benedict Cumberbatch and Jake Gyllenhaal.This Week’s Top StoryMEN IN BLACK TO BE REBOOTED AS A TRILOGY (WITHOUT WILL SMITH)Often times, stories about film development as you read them in columns like this one get their start as fully fleshed out stories in trades like Variety, or these days, on blogs like Deadline. There are other situations, however, where the “story” itself can be expressed in very few words, and then from there, writers can (and do) feel free to extrapolate and speculate at great length. Such was arguably the case this week when an interview with producers (and spouses) Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald ended with two brief statements about the future of Men in Black. Those ten words tell us that Will Smith is likely done (at least as the star) with his biggest franchise, and that Men in Black will be rebooted as a new trilogy of movies. This update also doesn’t conflict with the news earlier this year that Sony Pictures is considering connecting two of their franchises with the third Jonah Hill/Channing Tatum movie that we could just call 23 Jump Street.&nbsp; (Though it doesn’t actually go all the way and confirm that those plans will indeed happen; that probably would have required at least three more words.)Fresh Developments This Week1. AT LEAST 5 GHOSTBUSTERS STARS TO APPEAR IN NEXT YEAR’S… GHOSTBUSTERS (REBOOT)In July, we first heard that next year’s reboot of Ghostbusters (7/15/16) would feature an appearance by one of the stars of the original film, when Dan Aykroyd confirmed that he had filmed a scene with Kristen Wiig.&nbsp; Then, about a month later, Bill Murray also confirmed that he had filmed a “cameo” appearance in the reboot. Neither Aykroyd nor Murray are playing their original characters (Ray Stantz and Peter Venkman), and indeed, Dan Aykroyd was reportedly cast as a skeptic of the paranormal. This week, two more casting stories doubled the number of original stars returning, starting with the news that Ernie Hudson had also filmed at least one scene (on what was also the last day of principal photography). Hudson’s participation might be the most surprising, since he created something of an online stir several months ago, with the question, “If it has nothing to do with the other two movies, and it’s all female, then why are you calling it Ghostbusters?” Annie Potts, who played the Ghostbusters’ receptionist Janice, also was seen in Boston for filming recently.&nbsp; Finally, director Paul Feig took to Twitter this morning to announce that Sigourney Weaver has also agreed to be in the reboot. With the passing in 2014 of Harold Ramis, that now leaves only Rick Moranis (who played Louis) as the one of the original seven stars who hasn’t yet been mentioned as appearing in the Ghostbusters reboot.2. SICARIO ALREADY GETTING A SEQUEL, A WEEK BEFORE WIDE RELEASEThe drug war movie Sicario has only been in limited release a week, and won’t get its wide release until October 2nd. The film has had, however, a high per-screen box office average (the year’s highest to date), and is already being discussed by pundits as a strong contender in this year’s awards season. Perhaps for these reasons, Lionsgate has already begun development on a Sicario sequel, having hired the film’s screenwriter to start work. As explained in the linked article (which may reveal or suggest spoilers, be warned), the focus of the second movie will be on Benicio Del Toro’s “mysterious hitman” character. It is not yet known if director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Enemy) would return for the Sicario sequel.3.&nbsp;CUMBERBATCH AND GYLLENHAAL TO WAGE THE CURRENT WAR(Photo by Feng Li / Staff / Getty Images)In the 72 years since his death, something of a cult of personality has built up around the legacy of inventor Nicola Tesla. A frequent target of Tesla’s acolytes is American inventor (and former Tesla employer) Thomas Alva Edison, with much of that debate stemming from the late 19th century competition over which system would be used in widespread transmission of electricity. Tesla, however, actually sold his patent to an entrepeneur named George Westinghouse, so the “The War of Currents” was actually waged between Edison and Westinghouse, not Tesla himself. That little history lesson is important to explain this week’s news that Benedict Cumberbatch and Jake Gyllenhaal have been cast by the Weinstein Company in The Current War. Cumberbatch will play Thomas Edison, and Gyllenhaal will play George Westinghouse.&nbsp;The Current War will be directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, whose first two films as director were last year’s remake of The Town That Dreaded Sundown, and this year’s Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. George Westinghouse was something of a “portly” gentleman, and it’s not yet known if Jake Gyllenhaal will be bulking up on a diet of carbs to match Westinghouse’s look (it might just be easier to sport Westinghouse’s awesome ‘stache).4.&nbsp;CAPTAIN AMERICA AND THE JOKER BOARD THE GIRL ON THE TRAINCaptain America and the Joker may come from opposite sides of the DC/Marvel superhero movie competition, but this week, the two actors playing those characters — Chris Evans and Jared Leto — joined the same movie in similar roles.&nbsp; Now that the three female leads in the adaptation of the popular novel The Girl on the Train are cast, the production is moving on to two husband characters. If their deals come through, Chris Evans would play the husband of the character played by Rebecca Ferguson (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation), and the ex-husband of Emily Blunt’s title character. Likewise, Jared Leto would play the husband of the character played by Haley Bennett (The Equalizer).&nbsp;The Girl on the Train will be directed by Tate Taylor (The Help, Get On Up) for DreamWorks Pictures.5. IS EMMA STONE OR KATE WINSLET THE FAVOURITE?Although it does not yet have a release date in the States, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos’ English language debut, The Lobster, has been a hit on the international festival circuit, most notably&nbsp;winning&nbsp;the Jury Prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. This week, even as the US waits to actually see The Lobster, Lanthimos’ next film already started casting up. Kate Winslet, Emma Stone, and Olivia Colman (TV’s Broadchurch) are all in talks to costar in Yorgos Lanthimos’ next film, The Favourite. The premise is described as following the “political machinations behind the scenes during the reign of Queen Anne, the last monarch of the House of Stuarts” during the years 1702 to 1707. If the deals go through, Olivia Colman would play Queen Anne, Winslet would play a close confidante of the Queen, and Stone would play a distant, poor cousin of Winslet’s character who gains a court position serving the Queen.6.&nbsp;BRIE LARSON REPLACES EMMA STONE AS BILLIE JEAN KING IN BATTLE OF THE SEXES(Photo by Stephen Lovekin / Stringer / Getty Images)The idea of a movie based on the 1973 “Battle of the Sexes” tennis matches between male player Bobby Riggs and female player Billie Jean King has been bouncing around Hollywood for several years now. In that time, the delay has allowed&nbsp;three different projects to emerge and compete to be the one that beats the other two to actual production and eventual release. Two of them are a HBO/Playtone movie called Proof (starring Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti) and another called Match Maker, which has Will Ferrell attached to play Bobby Riggs. The project that appears it may be getting closest to happening is Fox Searchlight’s Battle of the Sexes. Steve Carell has long been attached to star as Bobby Riggs, but Emma Stone recently departed from starring as Billy Jean King.&nbsp; That casting conundrum was solved this week with the news that Brie Larson (Short Term 12,&nbsp;Trainwreck) is now in talks to replace Emma Stone. If the deal works out, Battle of the Sexes will be directed by the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who are best known for the indie comedy hits Little Miss Sunshine and Ruby Sparks.7. RACHEL WEISZ TO STAR AS MY COUSIN RACHEL(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez / Staff / Getty Images)It’s obviously more common for actors and actresses with common names like “John” or “Tom” or “Jennifer,” but for most, it’s rare that they land a role where the character has the same name they do. (Although sometimes the character name is chosen based on the name of the actor playing them.)&nbsp; In the case of Rachel Weisz, who knows, perhaps she’s always dreamed of starring in a movie based on Daphne Du Maurier’s classic 1951 novel My Cousin Rachel. Well, if that were true, she would be in luck, because she is now in talks with Fox Searchlight to play the title character in a new adaptation of My Cousin Rachel. The novel was first adapted as a 1952 film starring Olivia de Havilland and Richard Burton. This new adaptation will be directed by Roger Michell (Le Week-End, Notting Hill, Hyde Park on the Hudson). Rachel Weisz’ Rachel is a woman suspected of murdering a cousin by one of her other cousins. There sure is a lot of double wordplay in this story.8.&nbsp;GEORGE WASHINGTON GETS ACTION MOVIE TREATMENT IN THE VIRGINIANAlthough Hollywood does experiment with the era every once in a while&nbsp;(Last of the Mohicans, The Patriot), 18th century America is represented a lot less in modern movies than, say, the 19th century. You might think such movies would be much more common, considering that the late 1700s is the setting of the Revolutionary War, and the founding of the United States. This week brought news of at least one new movie attempting to correct that oversight. In a mid-six-figures deal, New Line Cinema has acquired the rights&nbsp;to a script called The Virginian about George Washington when he was a young colonial soldier.&nbsp;The Virginian is described as an action thriller about how a “down-and-out, young George Washington — desperate to join the British Army — accepts a dangerous mission to conquer a French fort and save the American colonies.” New Line’s acquisition of The Virginian may spark a race to production with another George Washington movie called The General, which is reportedly more of a traditional biopic about Washington’s later life. The Virginian was written by Michael Gunn, who has worked as a story editor on Aaron Sorkin’s HBO series, The Newsroom.9.&nbsp;JORDAN PEELE TO DIRECT HORROR COMEDY GET OUTIn his 1983 stand up comedy film Delirious, Eddie Murphy riffed on The Amityville Horror, mocking the spooky whisper “GET OUT!” as something that would make him leave any house (NSFW clip here), regardless of how nice it was (“too bad we can’t stay, baby!”).&nbsp; Thirty years later, that refrain is now being used as the title of a horror comedy&nbsp; to be written and directed by Jordan Peele, best known as one half of the comedy duo Key &amp; Peele, along with Keegan-Michael Key, who will costar with Peele in the comedy Keanu (4/22/16).&nbsp;Get Out is about “a young African-American man who visits his Caucasian girlfriend’s family estate.” Jordan Peele is writing and will make his feature film directorial debut, but is not expected to star as the lead character (though he may take a supporting role).&nbsp;Get Out will be produced by Blumhouse Productions, the company behind such horror films as Insidious, the Paranormal Activity franchise, and next year’s Amityville: The Awakening.Rotten Ideas of The WeekAll three of the movies opening in wide release this week might have Rotten Tomatometer scores, but here in the Weekly Ketchup, we’re pleased to announce… no major “Rotten Idea” stories this week!","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"BAFTA, Arrowverse, monsters, ABC, Bros., Kimmy, Best, Pictures, sequels, thriller, potter, of, Tour, jamie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MenInBlackNoWillSmith.jpg","slug":"men-in-black-reboots-as-a-trilogy-without-will-smith-sicario-gets-a-sequel-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509197837791","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Maleficent Sequel In the Works","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Maleficent Sequel In the WorksPlus, new roles for Tom Hanks, Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson, and Bradley Cooper, and another Halloween sequel.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 20, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers seven days from the realm of film development news, including headlines for such future movie titles as Gambit, Halloween Returns, Maleficent 2, Star Wars: Rogue One, and J.K. Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.&nbsp;This Week’s Top Story$750+ MILLION BLOCKBUSTER MALEFICENT TO GET A SEQUELAfter earning $758 million in worldwide box office last year (landing it the #4 spot for the year), it may have otherwise seemed like a no-brainer that in most situations, a movie like Maleficent would be getting a sequel.&nbsp; That is, until you consider that Maleficent was a retelling of Sleeping Beauty, and there doesn’t appear to be an immediately obvious way of continuing her story.&nbsp; (This writer’s guess: have Maleficent help out Snow White.)&nbsp; Well, Walt Disney Pictures is indeed proceeding with a Maleficent sequel, and for that job, they have hired screenwriter Linda Woolverton.&nbsp; Linda Woolverton is something of an old hand at both Disney movies, and more specifically, live action remakes of Disney cartoons.&nbsp; Not only did Linda Woolverton adapt Maleficent, but she also adapted Alice in Wonderland, and is also working on that movie’s sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass, and the live action remake of&nbsp; Beauty and the Beast (and also cowrote the original, and The Lion King, to boot).&nbsp; The next question for this project will be whether Walt Disney Pictures can successfully entice Angelina Jolie to return for this hypothetical sequel, as in recent years, Jolie has sometimes proven to be sequel-resistant (which is probably at least partially why we never saw sequels to movies like Beowulf, Salt, or Wanted).&nbsp;Fresh Developments This Week1. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES DIRECTOR BETS ON GAMBITAlthough we’ve known for a while now that Channing Tatum had signed with 20th Century Fox to star in a solo movie for popular X-Men character Gambit, what the project still lacked was a director.&nbsp; Well, that changed this week with the revelation that Gambit will be directed by Rupert Wyatt, the director who exceeded expectations with the franchise reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes.&nbsp; Wyatt’s hiring is timely, as Fox has long had Gambit scheduled for October 7th, 2016, and if they had gone on much longer without a director, one can speculate that the project might have come close to being rescheduled.&nbsp; As for long-lingering rumors and speculation that Channing Tatum might first make his debut as Gambit in next year’s X-Men: Apocalypse, in a Reddit AMA this week, Tatum directly answered the question with, “No ma’am, or sir. I definitely will not.”&nbsp; Well, there you go, then! This revelation might also answer some questions fans have had about how Gambit fits into the new post-Days-of-Future-Past timeline, especially if he’s ever going to have an on-screen romance with Rogue.&nbsp;2. TOM HANKS TO PLAY CAPTAIN SULLY FOR DIRECTOR CLINT EASTWOODAlthough Clint Eastwood has directed over 30 movies, and Tom Hanks has starred in over 50 movies, the two have never worked together in those capacities, but that’s apparently going to change soon.&nbsp; Just two weeks after the news broke that Clint Eastwood is going to next direct a movie about Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, Tom Hanks is now in talks with Warner Bros to take on that role.&nbsp; It’s something of a repeat call of duty for Tom Hanks, who also played the title character in the similarly-themed true story film, Captain Phillips, based on the true story of the highjacking of the Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates.&nbsp; In the case of the “Captain Sully” movie (which might be titled Highest Duty, from the title of Sullenberger’s book), the heroism is much more directly in the title character’s hands, as it was Sullenberger who safely landed a commercial passenger jet in the Hudson River on January 15, 2009.&nbsp;3. KATHERINE WATERSTON LANDS LEAD IN J.K. ROWLING’S FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEMNow that Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) has been cast as Newt Scamander, the fictional author of J.K. Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Warner Bros is proceeding with casting the other main roles.&nbsp; First up is the character described as being the female lead, a witch in the United States (where the movie is set, in the 1920s or 1930s) called Tina, which is short for Porpentina.&nbsp; That role has gone to Katherine Waterston ( http://www.thewrap.com/katherine-waterston-joins-eddie-redmayne-in-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them/ ), who in addition to being Sam Waterston’s daughter, also starred alongside Joaquin Phoenix &nbsp;in last year’s Inherent Vice.&nbsp; Warner Bros is expected to adapt J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter spinoff books into at least three movies, with the first film scheduled for November 18, 2016.&nbsp; Director David Yates also directed the last four Harry Potter movies, and currently has a new Tarzan movie (also for Warner Bros) scheduled for July 1, 2016.&nbsp;4.&nbsp;CHRISTIAN BALE AND OSCAR ISAAC MAKE THE PROMISE FOR HOTEL RWANDA DIRECTORChristian Bale and Oscar Isaac are both attached to star in The Promise, described as an “epic love story,” to be directed by Terry George (Hotel Rwanda, Some Mother’s Son).&nbsp; The Promise is set during the final days of the Ottoman Empire, and depicts the love triangle between a woman named Ana (not yet cast), a brilliant medical student (Isaac), and an American journalist based in Paris (Bale).&nbsp; In addition to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the premise is expected to be heavily inspired by the Armenian Genocide of 1915, which had an estimated death toll between 800,000 and 1.5 million.&nbsp; Filming of The Promise is scheduled to start in the fall of 2015 at locations in Portugal, the Canary Islands, and elsewhere in Southern Europe.&nbsp; Terry George cowrote The Promise with screenwriter Robin Swicord, whose credits also include adapting Memoirs of a Geisha and The Jane Austen Book Club, and cowriting Practical Magic.&nbsp;5. THE AFTERMATH OF JURASSIC WORLD: PASSENGERS GREENLIT, ELI ROTH TO DIRECT MEGMost predictions pegged Jurassic World as being likely to do very well, but the reality this past week has been more than a little bit past that.&nbsp; As of this writing, Jurassic World is expected to surpass $300 million domestically, breaking by one day the previous record held by The Avengers, which reached $300 million in nine days in 2012.&nbsp; These numbers have also pushed Universal Pictures into the year-to-date lead over all other studios, by at least $80 million over #2 Warner Bros, and $160 million over #3 Walt Disney Pictures.&nbsp; The domination of Jurassic World is also expected to prevent Inside Out from reaching #1 this weekend, which will make it the first Pixar movie not to open to #1, after the previous 14 Pixar films held that distinction.&nbsp; In the arena of film development news, there were two stories that were clearly directly connected to the success of Jurassic World.&nbsp; Most obviously, there was the news that Sony Pictures has greenlit the science fiction drama Passengers, in which Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence had already been in talks to star.&nbsp; The greenlight was made while it was still possible to sign Pratt for “only” $12 million (though that was an increase from his previous asking price of $10 million).&nbsp; Jennifer Lawrence landed the better deal of $20 million against 30% of the profit (probably because she has proven that she is a box office star without the help of a franchise like Marvel or Jurassic Park, which hasn’t happened for Chris Pratt… yet).&nbsp; The success of Jurassic World was such that it was even able to awaken nearly-dead film projects that have lingered in development hell for 18 years, much like the dinosaurs it depicts.&nbsp; Specifically, we’re talking about Meg, an adaptation of a novel about a Megaladon (a prehistoric giant shark), which was first put into development at Walt Disney Pictures in 1997, but is now based at Warner Bros. Horror director Eli Roth (Hostel, Cabin Fever, Knock Knock) is now in talks to direct Meg for Warner Bros.&nbsp; One of the changes that has been made to Meg since the novel’s publication is that the giant shark attacks will now be depicted as happening off the coast of China instead of the Pacific Island coast of California.&nbsp;6. FOREST WHITAKER JOINS STAR WARS: ROGUE ONE; AND OTHER STAR WARS TIDBITSFilming doesn’t start on the first Star Wars Anthology movie Star Wars: Rogue One until late 2015, but we already know now five of the actors who will be starring in this new prequel.&nbsp; The fifth such actor is Forest Whitaker, who is now in talks for an undisclosed role.&nbsp; Star Wars: Rogue One is set just before Star Wars: A New Hope, and depicts the efforts of a group of Rebel Alliance fighters as they plot to steal the Death Star plans that Princess Leia is smuggling when we first meet her.&nbsp; Riz Ahmed and Diego Luna have previously been cast as two of the Alliance fighters, Ben Mendelsohn is believed to be cast as film’s lead villain, and Felicity Jones has also been cast.&nbsp; In other Star Wars Anthology news, there was also a story this week that Breaking Bad director (and former would-be Wonder Woman director) Michelle MacLaren has taken a meeting with Lucasfilm about the job.&nbsp; Of course, a studio meets with lots of directors about big movies generally, so that doesn’t mean MacLaren will necessarily land the job, but… it’s still of interest. &nbsp;Finally, speaking of Ben Mendelsohn, the Australian star of Animal Kingdom and The Place Beyond the Pines has signed to costar with Rooney Mara in a drama called Blackbird. &nbsp;Mara will play a young woman who, 15 years later, re-enters the life of a man who went to prison for having a relationship with her when she was a minor.&nbsp;7. BRADLEY COOPER MIGHT STAR IN WORLD WAR II TRUE STORY GHOST ARMYThe Monuments Men is sometimes depicted as a bomb, and it was, critically, with a Tomatometer score of just 31 percent. What often goes unmentioned, though,&nbsp;is that The Monuments Men doubled its production budget, earning $155 million from a budget of “just” $70 million. Perhaps hoping to have better success,&nbsp;Warner Bros recently acquired the rights to a similar true story: Warner Bros and producers Bradley Cooper and Todd Phillips (The Hangover) are now developing an adaptation of the non-fiction book The Ghost Army of World War II: How One Top-Secret Unit Deceived the Enemy with Inflatable Tanks, Sound Effects, and Other Audacious Fakery.&nbsp; That title is so long (and detailed) that I can basically stop writing the rest of this story now, except to say that Bradley Cooper may also star in the movie as well as producing it.&nbsp; You can also read more about the “Ghost Army” in its&nbsp;Wikipedia entry.&nbsp;Rotten Ideas of the Week2. WOODY HARRELSON TO STAR AS THE 36TH POTUSA IN LBJThere was a time (the 1980s and early 1990s) when former All in the Family costar Rob Reiner was considered one of Hollywood’s most critic-friendly directors.&nbsp; Such films as This is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me, The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally…, Misery, and A Few Good Men are all in Reiner’s filmography as director.&nbsp; This year, however, marks the 20th anniversary of the last time (The American President, Certified Fresh at 90 percent) one of Reiner’s films as directors earned a Fresh Tomatometer score. And it wasn’t for a lack of trying; Reiner has directed eight movies since The American President.&nbsp; Will his ninth effort change his luck?&nbsp; Critics like presidential biopics, so&nbsp;how about one of those? Rob Reiner will direct Woody Harrelson as the 36th President of the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson, in the political drama LBJ.&nbsp; Reiner’s film is likely to be the first feature film about the life of President Johnson, although HBO and Steven Spielberg are also producing an adaptation (for that channel) of the Broadway play All the Way, with Bryan Cranston reprising his portrayal of Johnson. President Johnson was also recently depicted as one of the antagonists to Martin Luther King, Jr. in last year’s Selma.&nbsp; Lyndon B. Johnson’s “struggles to heal a nation and secure his presidency by passing Kennedy’s historic Civil Rights Act” will be a core story arc of Rob Reiner’s LBJ.&nbsp; The film will be the feature film debut of screenwriter Joey Hartstone, who has previously worked as an associate producer on the competitive reality show Project Runway.&nbsp; Filming of LBJ will start at locations in Baton Rouge, Dallas, New Orleans, and Washington D.C. in September, 2015.&nbsp;1. THIS WEEK IN HALLOWEEN: HALLOWEEN RETURNS AND ROB ZOMBIE’S DIRECTING… WAIT, WHAT NOW?Sometimes synchronicity in movie development news has obvious causes, but other times, it’s probably just a coincidence.&nbsp; The latter is probably why this week there’s two different news stories connected to the Halloween franchise. The first is direct, the second is indirect. Directly, we learned that the first Halloween movie since 2009’s Halloween II is scheduled to start filming next month. Titled Halloween Returns, this 11th film appears to be a sequel to either Rob Zombie’s reboot movies (presuming those movies were mostly set in the 1990s), or possibly the previous Halloween movies also set in the 1990s. The film will “pit a new group of Haddonfield youngsters against Myers. The now 18-year-old child of one of Myers’ victims plays a central role along with the child of a cop whose long been obsessed with Myers’ case, even putting it before his own daughter.&nbsp; Myers is now on death row and the two kids with their own personal vendettas against the killer sneak in to watch his execution. But when things go awry and Myers escapes, the pair, along with their friends, find themselves in the firing line.”&nbsp;Halloween Returns will be directed by Marcus Dunstan (The Collector, The Collection, Saw IV) from a script he cowrote with his screenwriting partner Patrick Melton, with whom he cowrote four of the Saw movies (IV, V, VI, and 3D); This is the week’s most Rotten Idea because no Halloween movie after the original has ever earned a Tomatometer score above 51 percent. As for the second Halloween-related news of the week, it’s not so much Rotten news as it is just plain weird. Director Rob Zombie is preparing to expand his oevre beyond just horror/torture movies, with an adaptation of a memoir about life with one of Hollywood’s original movie stars.&nbsp; Rob Zombie will direct an adaptation of Steve Soliar’s memoir Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho’s House, which is being adapted by Oren Moverman, who also cowrote the celebrity biopics I’m Not There and this month’s Love &amp; Mercy, as well as Jesus’ Son and The Messenger. Rob Zombie’s highest Tomatometer score as a solo director was the 53&nbsp;percent&nbsp;he earned for The Devil’s Rejects.&nbsp;","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Apple, Rocky, historical, book, OneApp, FOX, First, Baby, Comics, Crackle, drama, japanese","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Maleficent2Ketchup.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-maleficent-sequel-in-the-works"},{"id":"47509197826520","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Bad Boys 3 and 4 Announced","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Bad Boys 3 and 4 AnnouncedPlus, a new Coen brothers film, Ronda Rousey stars in her own biopic, Naruto goes live action, and Freddy Krueger gets rebooted... again.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 7, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers 10 headlines from the last 7 days from the realm of film development news.&nbsp; Included in the mix are news stories about such movies as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Kong: Skull Island, My Little Pony, Naruto, A Nightmare on Elm Street, PEZ, Robin Hood: Origins, and the Ronda Rousey biopic.This Week’s Top StoryBAD BOYS 3 AND BAD BOYS 4 BOTH ON THE CASEA series of release date announcements this week brought several long-in-development movie projects into the limelight of social media this week. Many of these stories came from Sony Pictures, which announced the release dates of over a dozen movies. That slate included release dates for both Bad Boys 3 (2/17/17) and Bad Boys 4 (7/3/19), with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence expected (but not necessarily confirmed) to return for both “buddy cop” sequels. Curiously, Bad Boys 4 has a much higher profile release date, which suggests that Sony may have bigger plans for the fourth Bad Boys movie than for the third. (Will Smith also made the news this week for replacing Hugh Jackman in Collateral Beauty.)&nbsp;Other sequels that received release dates are Underworld 5 (10/21/16) and Resident Evil 6 (1/27/17) (which Ali Larter is now signed to return for.) &nbsp;On the remake side, there’s Ghostbusters (7/15/16), The Magnificent Seven (9/23/16), and Jumanji (12/25/16). There’s also the Stephen King adaptation The Dark Tower (1/13/17), Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver (3/17/17), the toy adaptation Barbie (6/2/17), the video game adaptation Uncharted (6/30/17), and Sony’s animated Nativity story The Lamb (12/8/17). Sony wasn’t the only studio to make the news this week for release dates, however, as Warner Bros also made a few big moves, as the Steven Spielberg-directed adaptation of the popular novel Ready Player One is now scheduled for December 15, 2017.&nbsp; Ben Affleck’s commitments to playing Batman in multiple movies also may have had an impact on scheduling this week, as two of his movies both got moved back by Warner Bros: The Accountant (from 1/29/16 to 10/17/16), and the Affleck-directed Live by Night (from 10/17/16 to sometime in 2017).Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;THE COEN BROTHERS TO ADAPT CRIME NOVEL BLACK MONEYThe Coen Brothers (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) recently wrapped filming of their “Golden Age of Hollywood” comedy Hail Caesar! for Universal Pictures, and they are already looking at what might be their next film.&nbsp; To that end, Warner Bros has hired Joel and Ethan Coen to write and possibly direct a crime novel adaptation called Black Money. That novel, by the late Ross McDonald, follows his private eye character Lew Archer: “Hired by a spurned lover to expose the suave Frenchman who has run off with his client’s girlfriend, Archer follows a trail that leads to a deep conspiracy as the mysterious paramour is connected to a seven-year-old suicide and a ton of gambling debts.” The deal is being compared to Inherent Vice, which was another recent example of a classic detective novel being adapted by a modern acclaimed director(s). Universal Pictures has scheduled Hail, Caesar! (which features Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Jonah Hill, Scarlett Johansson, and Channing Tatum) for February 5, 2016.2.&nbsp;UFC CHAMPION RONDA ROUSEY TO STAR IN HER OWN BIOPICAs this column at Film School Rejects points out, Hollywood has a somewhat rocky history with people starring in their own biopics. In some cases, the problem is that the famous person in question didn’t necessarily become famous based on their amazing acting abilities, so “acting” as themselves doesn’t work out. There are examples, however, where there are other reasons why the biopic subject really is the best choice to star in the movie.&nbsp; That might be the logic behind the news this week that UFC Champion Ronda Rousey will star as herself in her own biopic. That movie will be an adaptation of Ronda Rousey’s biography, titled My Fight/Your Fight. Paramount Pictures is the studio that won the rights to Rousey’s book, and Mark Bomback (Live Free or Die Hard) is the writer that the studio has hired to adapt it.&nbsp; There’s no production start date for Rousey’s biopic yet (there’s also no director signed), but it probably won’t be this year.3.&nbsp;KONG: SKULL ISLAND CASTS MARVEL ALUMNI SAMUEL L. JACKSON AND JOHN C. REILLYThe last time that Universal’s giant monster reboot Kong: Skull Island (3/10/17) made the news, it was about the departure of Michael Keaton and J.K. Simmons. This week, we heard about several new names for Kong: Skull Island, including the two actors expected to replace Keaton and Simmons.&nbsp; We should also first mention that Tom Hiddleston (Marvel’s “Loki”) remains cast as the film’s male lead. Samuel L. Jackson (Marvel’s “Nick Fury”) and John C. Reilly (from Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy) are both reportedly in talks (or being eyed) to replace J.K. Simmons and Michael Keaton, respectively. Brie Larson (21 Jump Street, Trainwreck) has also been cast as the film’s female lead, and Tom Wilkinson has been offered one of the ensemble’s lead roles. Corey Hawkins (Straight Outta Compton) has also been cast in a supporting role.&nbsp;Kong: Skull Island will be directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts (The Kings of Summer) from a script by Max Borenstein (2014’s Godzilla) and John Gatins (Flight, Real Steel).4.&nbsp;KRISTIN CHENOWETH TO VOICE NEW CHARACTER IN MY LITTLE PONYIt was in last October that we first heard about plans for an animated feature film based on My Little Pony. This week, we heard our first casting news for the feature, which remains scheduled for release in 2017. Broadway and TV star Kristin Chenoweth will provide the voice for a new character who will be introduced in the feature film. It’s unknown if there are also plans for Kristin Chenoweth’s character to do any singing. This news came out of a Lionsgate financial analysts call this week, which included confirmation of their plans for a Monopoly movie (also with Hasbro), and a new Robinson Crusoe movie which might lead to a new film franchise.5. NARUTO MAKING THE JUMP TO LIVE ACTIONMuch like &nbsp;readers of superhero comics once upon a time, fans of Japanese anime and manga still sort of exist in their own little niche of fandom, and even the most popular titles remain mostly unfamiliar to non-fans. And yet,&nbsp;during the late 2000s, the word “Naruto” consistently made year-end “top search results.” Naruto began as a Japanese manga series (in Shonen Jump), and then became even more popular as an anime series, which was then followed by animated feature films, video games, a trading card game, and much more. Now, Lionsgate is “jumping” onto the Naruto bandwagon, with plans for a live action feature film about the continuing adventures of&nbsp;the titular teenage ninja Naruto Uzumaki. The live-action Naruto movie may mark the feature film directorial debut of Michael Gracey, who has formerly worked as the visual effects supervisor on movies like Ned Kelly. That will depend upon whether the P.T. Barnum biopic The Greatest Showman on Earth gets made before or after Naruto receives its greenlight.6.&nbsp;KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE BREAKOUT STAR HEADING TO SHERWOODPossibly inspired by the success of The Hunger Games, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, and DC’s Arrow TV series, there are multiple projects in development in Hollywood based on the legends of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. This includes Disney’s Nottingham &amp; Hood, Sony’s plans for a “Robin Hood cinematic universe” (Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet, etc.), and also a Robin Hood project at Warner Bros. This week, it was Lionsgate that seemed to get an early headstart in the race, as they have already cast their lead. Taron Egerton, the young breakout star of this year’s Kingsman: The Secret Service, is now in talks with Lionsgate to star in Robin Hood: Origins. This movie is being described as a “gritty, revisionist take” and compared to The Dark Knight.&nbsp;Robin Hood: Origins will be the feature film directorial debut of Otto Bathurst, who has worked on TV shows like Peaky Blinders. The lingering question surrounding the question of whether Taron Egerton will be able to sign on for Robin Hood: Origins concerns scheduling, namely if 20th Century Fox will start filming the Kingsman sequel around the same time.7. WB WINS “SAVE VS LAWSUIT” ROLL, PROCEEDS WITH DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS MOVIEIt was over two years ago that we last reported on Warner Bros’ new plans for a Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie (coincidentally, in that same column, we reported about the movie which became this week’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation). However, there was also a lawsuit in the meantime over which company had the rights to make another Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie, and that case is now settled. The result is that Warner Bros can move forward with their planned adaptation, with representatives of both Hasbro and Sweetpea Entertainment (the two parties on either side of the lawsuit) attached as producers. The new Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie is being adapted by screenwriter David Leslie Johnson (Orphan, Red Riding Hood), who is also working on the new Nightmare on Elm Street reboot (see below). Warner Bros is still looking for a director to take on the role of Dungeon Master.&nbsp;ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. FREDDY KRUEGER ALREADY GETTING ANOTHER ELM STREET REBOOTIt has only been five years since New Line Cinema attempted to reboot their A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise with a new movie starring Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger. Although that reboot earned a Rotten score of just 15 percent, its global box office was $115 million, making it the most successful of New Line’s horror reboots globally (and #2 domestically, behind Friday the 13th). However, plans for a sequel to the 2010 movie have not gone anywhere in the last five years. So, New Line Cinema is already making moves for yet another reboot to their Nightmare on Elm Street horror franchise, which will be the 10th film in the franchise. New Line Cinema has hired screenwriter David Leslie Johnson (Orphan, Red Riding Hood), who is also working on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie (see above), to work on rebooting Freddy Krueger. This isn’t the first time, however, that a relatively recently rebooted horror franchise was put into development for a second reboot. The same is also being done currently for second reboots of the Friday the 13th, Halloween,&nbsp;and Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchises.1. PEZ: COLLECTIBLE CANDY COMES TO CINEMAFor people who have been playing with LEGO sets most of their lives, or playing the various video games, the reasons why The LEGO Movie worked might be apparent. To Hollywood insiders, a different lesson may have been communicated, which is that “non narrative” toys and games can be adapted into very successful movies. In the last 18 months, plenty of such projects have been put into development, including Emoji, Play-Doh, Hello Kitty, and Minecraft. This week, Envision Media Arts (Celeste &amp; Jesse Forever) signed a deal with PEZ Candy Inc. to develop an animated feature film based upon the company’s signature candy line.&nbsp; First introduced in Austria in 1927, PEZ is best known for their licensed dispensers featuring hundreds of characters from movies (Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz), cartoons (both Looney Tunes and Disney), and comic books (both DC and Marvel).&nbsp; Envision Media Arts has hired screenwriter Cameron Fay, who is also currently working on a new Three Stooges sequel, to figure out how to turn PEZ dispensers into an actual movie with characters, and dialogue, and story.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"2020, Moore, documentary, black, Premium, Competition, FirstLook, golden, Legendary, godzilla, spider-man, anthology","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BadBoys1.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-bad-boys-3-and-4-announced"},{"id":"47509197836766","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Tom Holland Is the New Spider-Man","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Tom Holland Is the New Spider-ManPlus, new roles for Dwayne Johnson, Michael Keaton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and films based on the work of Stanley Kubrick and Michael Crichton.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 26, 2015 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup covers ten stories from the last seven days in the film development news world. Included in the mix are news stories for movies like Captain America: Civil War, Micro, Rampage, and Star Trek 3.This Week’s Top Story19 YEAR OLD TOM HOLLAND CAST AS MARVEL’S SPIDER-MANAfter months of rumors, speculation, and a few different “short lists,” this week Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures officially announced who will be replacing 31-year-old Andrew Garfield as their teenage superhero Spider-Man. The role of Peter Parker has gone&nbsp;to 19-year-old British actor Tom Holland, who was previously best known for costarring in 2012’s The Impossible, and for starring in Billy Elliot in the London production. Tom Holland is expected to almost immediately report to Atlanta to start filming his first film as Peter Parker, in next year’s Captain America: Civil War (5/6/16). After that film wraps, the focus will turn to the new solo Spider-Man movie, which Sony Pictures (and Marvel) has scheduled for July 28, 2017. That movie will be directed by Jon Watts, whose Sundance hit Cop Car is scheduled for release&nbsp;on August 7, 2015. Other young actors that Marvel and Sony considered before casting Tom Holland included Asa Butterfield (Hugo), Judah Lewis (this fall’s Demolition), Matthew Lintz (Pixels), Charlie Plummer (HBO’s Boardwalk Empire), and Charlie Rowe (TV’s Red Band Society). Tom Holland won the role as Peter Parker after a series of screen tests, which included auditioning with Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans, under supervision from Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige and former Sony executive Amy Pascal. Other directors that Marvel and Sony considered before hiring Jon Watts included Jonathan Levine (Warm Bodies), Ted Melfi (St. Vincent), and codirectors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (Vacation). As for whether Tom Holland will be able to convincingly replicate some of Peter Parker’s more gymnastic jumps and flips, check out the videos Holland has posted to his Instagram account.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;STANLEY KUBRICK’S 1950S CIVIL WAR EPIC THE DOWNSLOPE TO FINALLY GET MADEIn the final 40 years of his life, influential director Stanley Kubrick was only able to get nine films actually produced, but some of his greatest projects eluded him. Steven Spielberg quickly took over A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and some of Kubrick’s other unproduced projects included a Napoleon Bonaparte biopic (with Jack Nicholson) and a World War II project similar to Spielberg’s Schindler’s List. One of Kubrick’s oldest such scripts was called The Downslope, which was written in 1956, in between Fear and Desire and Kubrick’s first major critical success, Paths of Glory. Now, over 55 years later, The Downslope finally looks to be adapted, and ambitiously, it is being planned as three separate films. The Downslope is a Civil War epic about the “bitter, strategic series of Civil War battles in the Shenandoah Valley between Union General George Armstrong Custer and Confederate Colonel John Singleton Mosby, known as the Gray Ghost for his stealth and elusiveness.” The first of the three Downslope adaptations will be directed by Marc Forster, whose filmography&nbsp;includes World War Z and the “Certified Fresh” films Monster’s Ball, Finding Neverland, and Stranger than Fiction.2.&nbsp;CHRIS PINE AND ZACHARY QUINTO SIGNED FOR STAR TREK 4One of the recurring themes in film development stories this year (and last year, too) has been that Sony Pictures is suffering at the box office against stronger competitors like Universal, Disney, and Warner Bros. What’s overlooked in that meme, however, is that in years without a Transformers movie (like, say, 2015), Paramount Pictures isn’t doing much better, either. To date, in 2015, Paramount has only 5.2% of the market share (far behind the top four studios, who account for 74.1% of the share). So, Paramount is very much in the business of shoring up what franchises it still has, and this week, that news was all about Star Trek. Even as Zachary Quinto is getting his eyebrows ready&nbsp;for filming of Star Trek 3 (possibly called Star Trek Beyond) in Dubai and Vancouver,&nbsp;Paramount is also getting ready for Star Trek 4. After contract negotiations related to California laws preventing contracts from binding individuals over 7 years, Paramount has struck new contracts with their Star Trek cast. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, in particular, now have much better contracts for their third and fourth Star Trek movies. Paramount’s rebooted Captain Kirk, for example, only made $600,000 for the first movie in 2009, but will earn ten times that amount for Star Trek 3. Paramount has scheduled Star Trek 3 for July 8, 2016.3.&nbsp;WALK THE LINE DIRECTOR TO ADAPT SEDUCING INGRID BERGMANAlthough director James Mangold is currently prepping for his second Wolverine movie with Hugh Jackman, the director of Walk the Line is now signed on for another celebrity romance movie. James Mangold will direct an adaptation of the Chris Greenhalgh book&nbsp;Seducing Ingrid Bergman, about the romance in post-WWII 1945 Paris between the acclaimed actress&nbsp;and war photographer Robert Capa. If Mangold can get his film through development and produced in a timely fashion, he may win a “dueling movies” race with other productions to get a movie about Robert Capa made. The other project, sometimes (ironically) called Waiting for Robert Capa, has had directors Michael Mann, Tom Hiddleston, and Gemma Arterton (not as Ingrid Bergman) attached. However, that film remains stuck in development as of this writing. James Mangold reportedly wanted to call his Bergman/Capa film Blood and Champagne, but that title will probably not be used.4.&nbsp;DAMON AND AFFLECK PRODUCING FIFA SCANDAL MOVIE HOUSES OF DECEITLongtime producing partners Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are teaming up once again&nbsp;for a timely “ripped from the headlines”-style adaptation of the non-fiction book Houses of Deceit by Buzzfeed writer Ken Bensinger. The book is described as being “the definitive account of American FIFA exec Chuck Blazer and his role in the largest sports and public corruption scandal in history.” This soccer scandal drama will be directed by Gavin O’Connor&nbsp;(Warrior, Pride and Glory) for Warner Bros, working from a script by Anthony Tambakis (Warrior, Jane Got a Gun). Ben Affleck and Gavin O’Connor recently worked together on the thriller The Accountant (1/29/16). There was also an online rumor this week&nbsp;that Ben Affleck might be directing a solo Batman movie (which he will also star in) for 2018. If that rumor is correct, Warner Bros might be making the official announcement in two weeks at San Diego Comic-Con.5.&nbsp;DWAYNE JOHNSON JOINS VIDEO GAME ADAPTATION RAMPAGEWe don’t yet know if July’s Pixels will be a box office blockbuster, but Jurassic World certainly was, and this news story can be seen as influenced by both movies. New Line Cinema is planning on starting filming in the summer of 2016 on an adaptation of the classic Midway arcade game&nbsp;Rampage. In that game (and many sequels and remakes that followed), humans are mutated into giant monsters that start destroying cities around the nation (starting in Peoria, Illinois, of all places). The monsters include George (a gorilla a la King Kong), Lizzy (basically Godzilla), and Ralph (a giant werewolf). The human forces dealing with the titular “rampage” will be led by Dwayne Johnson, who will start filming Rampage next summer after wrapping Fast &amp; Furious 8 for Universal Pictures. Johnson is also currently working with New Line Cinema on the action comedy Central Intelligence, along with Kevin Hart. Rampage will be the fourth time that Johnson has worked with producer Beau Flynn, after Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, Hercules, and New Line Cinema’s San Andreas.6.&nbsp;MICHAEL CRICHTON’S SHRINKING ADVENTURE MICRO EXPANDS TO THE BIG SCREENMarvel’s Ant-Man is still 3 weeks from release, but at least one competing studio appears to have made a move towards developing a similar project in response to the film’s potential success. DreamWorks Studios has acquired the feature film rights&nbsp;to the 2011 novel Micro, by Michael Crichton and Richard Preston. Michael Crichton died in 2008 at the age of 66, and Micro was finished posthumously&nbsp; by author Richard Preston (The Hot Zone, The Demon in the Freezer). Micro is “a high-concept thriller that follows a group of graduate students lured to Hawaii to work for a mysterious biotech company – only to find themselves miniaturized and cast out into the rain forest, with nothing but their scientific expertise and wits to protect them.” DreamWorks Studios is also developing Michael Crichton’s other posthumously-published novel, Pirate Latitudes, set in the Caribbean in the 17th Century. Michael Crichton’s many other adaptations&nbsp;include Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain, Congo, and he also worked on Westworld, and produced the NBC TV series ER.7.&nbsp;MICHAEL KEATON JOINS COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION IMAGINE AGENTSSince winning a Golden Globe (and an Academy Award nomination) for Birdman, Michael Keaton has been on exactly the sort of comeback trail that his Birdman character would have envied. Keaton’s next film will be Spotlight (about the Catholic Church child molestation scandal in Boston). Keaton is also signed to play McDonald’s executive Ray Kroc in The Founder, and will also star in next year’s Kong: Skull Island, along with Tom Hiddleston. And now, with this week’s news, Michael Keaton is now attached to another comic book adaptation (although it’s not a superhero movie, a la Batman). Michael Keaton is producing and will star&nbsp;in a Men in Black-style science fiction/action comedy movie called Imagine Agents, based upon the Boom! Comics title. Imagine Agents (also sometimes written as I.M.A.G.I.N.E. Agents) is about a secret organization that works with the very real entities otherwise known as children’s “imaginary friends.” Michael Keaton will play “a jaded 20-year veteran agent” (a la Tommy Lee Jones in the Men in Black movies). Imagine Agents is set up at 20th Century Fox.Rotten Ideas of the Week2.&nbsp;ARNOLD SCHWARZEGGER JOINS REVENGE MOVIE BANDWAGON WITH 478Although there were certainly movies like Taken before 2008, that film’s success created something of a mini-wave of movies for actors of a certain age. About half of them have also starred Liam Neeson, but there was also Denzel Washington in The Equalizer, Keanu Reeves in John Wick, Kevin Costner in 3 Days to Kill, Mel Gibson in Edge of Darkness, Pierce Brosnan in The November Man, and Sean Penn in The Gunman. Well, we can now probably add Arnold Schwarzenegger to this growing list in the future, based on one of this week’s news stories. Schwarzenegger has signed with Darren Aronofsky’s Protozoa production company to star in a revenge thriller called 478. The script was written by Javier Gullon, who worked with Denis Villeneuve on Enemy (and also two other recent films which received Rotten Tomatometer scores). Arnold Schwarzenegger will play a widower whose wife and child are killed in a plane crash caused by an air traffic controller, so the man sets out to take revenge. (The title 478 is probably a reference to the downed plane’s flight number). This story landed in this spot as one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based on the 5-out-of-5 Rotten scores Arnold Schwarzenegger has earned since 2013.1.&nbsp;DISNEY’S LATEST ADVENTURE HERO: …CHARLES DARWIN?Walt Disney Pictures may already have the various Marvel Studios characters, Star Wars, and Indiana Jones, but the studio remains open to also developing other action and adventure properties. One unusual such example made the news this week and seems sort of like it was compiled by the manatee writers from South Park. Screenwriter Stephen Gaghan (Traffic, Syriana) has made a deal with Walt Disney Pictures to write and direct&nbsp;“an adventure film involving Charles Darwin, “the British naturalist and geologist who made breakthroughs in the areas of evolution and natural selection.” The exact nature of this adventure movie hasn’t been disclosed yet, but it’s speculated that the premise will involve Darwin’s five years aboard the HMS Beagle, during which he made many of the discoveries that would in later years inspire his writings. Although Traffic and Syriana were Certified Fresh, most of Gaghan’s other films have received Rotten Tomatometer scores, like Havoc (45%), Rules of Engagement (36%), The Alamo (29%), Abandon (16%), and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (7%).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"japanese, Vudu, archives, Music","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Spider-Man-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-tom-holland-is-the-new-spiderman"},{"id":"47509197832668","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Ben Affleck Will Direct and Star in Batman Solo Movie","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Ben Affleck Will Direct and Star in Batman Solo MoviePlus, casting for Spider-Man, some Comic-Con rumors, big news for Star Wars, and an unlikely new live action Disney adaptation.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 10, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup comes to you from the middle of the big four day event that is this year’s San Diego Comic-Con, and as can be expected, more than half of this week’s stories are connected to SDCC. Included in the mix are stories for such movies (titles not official) as Batman, Black Panther, Spider-Man, Star Wars Anthology: Han Solo, and X-Men: Apocalypse.This Week’s Top StoryBEN AFFLECK TO DIRECT AND STAR IN A BATMAN SOLO MOVIEIn the same year in which Marvel Studios decided not to hold their own event at San Diego Comic-Con, Warner Bros and DC Comics are doing very much the opposite, with plenty expected to be unveiled tomorrow (Saturday) in Hall H. As happens almost every year, however, some of the event’s biggest revelations were actually announced in advance, including this week’s biggest superhero movie news. As has long been anticipated (in the “well, duh” category), Ben Affleck is now signed to cowrite, direct, and star in a solo Batman movie, following up after next year’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Affleck’s cowriter on the project will be Geoff Johns, who is DC Comics’ chief creative officer, and frequent writer on such titles as Justice League, Batman, Aquaman, The Flash, Green Lantern, and Superman. Affleck and Johns are expected to finish the script this summer before Affleck starts filming his long-in-the-works adaptation of Dennis Lehane’s Live by Night (also for Warner Bros), after which the Batman solo movie will then be Affleck’s next film. The story is expected to be set after Justice League Part One, which is scheduled for release on November 17, 2017. The solo Batman movie doesn’t have a release date yet.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;HAN SOLO CONFIRMED TO GET HIS OWN “SOLO” PREQUELAs this column is being written, we’re only two hours away from the day’s biggest event at San Diego Comic-Con, which is the Lucasfilm panel, which might give us confirmation of some big news, or something we can’t even see coming. One very big story that Lucasfilm broke earlier this week in advance of SDCC is the confirmation that the second Star Wars Anthology prequel movie will depict the early adventurers of Han Solo. The Han Solo prequel, showing what the smuggler was doing before he ever met Luke Skywalker, will be directed by the team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, following their successes with such films as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street, and The LEGO Movie. This Han Solo movie was written by Lawrence Kasdan, with his son Jon Kasdan. Lawrence Kasdan’s previous Star Wars screenwriting work includes The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and this year’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens. We don’t know the final title yet, but this Han Solo prequel is scheduled for May 25, 2018. As for unconfirmed news which might be confirmed very soon, there was also a story this week that said that Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow might be announced to direct Star Wars Episode IX, which is expected to be released sometime in 2019.2.&nbsp;MARISA TOMEI CAST AS PETER PARKER’S AUNT MAYAlthough it was followed by bigger stories this week, when this news came out, it seemed pretty huge (just not Batman/Han Solo-huge), and it was also the subject of a lot of attention on Facebook and Twitter. This story points out one of the odder things about how Stan Lee and Steve Ditko first created The Amazing Spider-Man. Specifically, if Peter Parker was a teenager, why did his Aunt May look so, well, old? Over time, newer depictions of Aunt May have de-aged her considerably (such as the casting of Sally Field, and the teenage girl in Trouble), but Marvel never went as far as this week’s casting. 50-year-old actress Marisa Tomei has been cast by Sony and Marvel Studios to play Peter Parker’s Aunt May in the new solo movie scheduled for July 28, 2017. Two years from now, Marisa Tomei will be 52, and the new Peter Parker, Tom Holland, will be 21, playing a high school student. Tomei may make her Aunt May debut in next year’s Captain America: Civil War, but that hasn’t been confirmed yet.3.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN GHOSTBUSTERS: THE COSTUMES, ECTO-1, AND CASTING NEWSWith filming now underway in Boston, it was probably inevitable that we would be learning a lot more about the female-led Ghostbusters reboot this month. What was more surprising was how much of it all came within a few days this week. If you haven’t seen it yet, we should really start with this cast photo showing the four leads in the new Ghostbusters uniforms. (Which, breaking news, was followed up by this image which also shows their proton packs). This week, we also saw the newly refurbished Ecto-1 hearse, as well as the new addition, the Ecto-2 motorcycle. In casting news, we learned that Andy Garcia has signed on as the Mayor of New York City, with Michael K. Williams (The Wire), Matt Walsh (Veep), and SNL alum Cecily Strong all also landing supporting roles. Finally, in more breaking news, comedian Neil Casey has been cast as the movie’s villain, though it’s unclear if his role will be as a human or as a ghost. Sony Pictures has scheduled Ghostbusters for July 22, 2016.4.&nbsp;JADA PINKETT SMITH WANTS TO JOIN HER HUSBAND IN SUICIDE SQUAD 2As of this writing, some of the biggest panels of Comic-Con have yet to happen, but reporters are talking to various stars and directors, and from those pieces, we get some hints about possible revelations. For example, Jada Pinkett Smith, whose husband Will Smith plays Deadshot in next year’s Suicide Squad, talked this week about which DC Comics character she hopes she can play in the inevitable Suicide Squad 2. Speaking to MTV UK, Jada Pinkett Smith said, “There’s a character that I love in the DC World, her name is Vixen… Probably haven’t heard much of her. She’s kind of in that Suicide Squad world as well. I love Vixen. If there was any character, I would love to play her. I’m going to have to put my little word in with the director. ‘Vixen for Suicide Sqaud 2.'” Suicide Squad is scheduled for August 5, 2016, and Warner Bros has not yet announced Suicide Squad 2.5.&nbsp;BUCK ROGERS MIGHT GET A REBOOT IN ARMAGEDDON 2419 A.D.Like Flash Gordon, the classic science fiction matinee hero Buck Rogers is another character that various figures in Hollywood have been trying to reboot for several years. (You can check out this Google search for some of the coverage of these stories in the Weekly Ketchup in the past). The latest such effort is now coming from producer Don Murphy, whose credits include Real Steel, Natural Born Killers, and the Transformers franchise. Murphy’s Angryfilms production company has optioned the rights to the 1929 novella Armageddon 2419 A.D. by Philip Francis Nowlan, which first introduced the character we now know as Buck Rogers. Although the specifics vary from version to version, most Buck Rogers incarnations agree on the point of him being an adventurer who finds himself frozen in time for several hundred years and waking up in the 25th century. This adaptation of Armageddon 2419 A.D. is being adapted by screenwriters Flint Dille (An American Tail: Fievel Goes West) and Ed Neumeier (RoboCop).Rotten Ideas of the Week4.&nbsp;AVA DUVERNAY NO LONGER IN THE RUNNING TO DIRECT MARVEL’S BLACK PANTHERIn the modern state of the Internet, sometimes stories take on a life of their own without ever being actually announced as anything resembling “official.” Sometimes a story doesn’t have to be “official” for people to start thinking that the story is true, because the headlines speak loudly on their Facebook or Twitter feeds. That’s sort of what happened in recent weeks with the meme that Selma director Ava DuVernay was going to be directing Marvel’s Black Panther (7/6/18). Last Friday night, we learned that DuVernay had talked to Essence about exactly this story, and she cleared up the issue. Here are some of her direct quotes: “I’m not signing on to direct Black Panther… I think I’ll just say we had different ideas about what the story would be. Marvel has a certain way of doing things and I think they’re fantastic and a lot of people love what they do. I loved that they reached out to me.” Monday was July 6th, which means that we are currently just under three years away from the release of Black Panther, so there’s still plenty of time for the movie to find its director. This story is a “Rotten Idea” just because of the three Certified Fresh scores on Ava DuVernay’s Tomatometer, which is a challenge to whoever lands the job instead.3.&nbsp;IS TAYLOR SWIFT DAZZLER IN NEXT YEAR’S X-MEN: APOCALYPSE?Although Marvel Studios itself is sitting out the 2015 edition of Comic-Con, that is not true of 20th Century Fox, which will have a Hall H panel on Saturday. The studio has (at least) three Marvel movies they’re promoting — The Fantastic Four (8/7/15), Deadpool (2/12/16), and X-Men: Apocalypse (5/27/16) — though they might also cover Gambit (10/7/16), the third Wolverine solo movie (3/3/17), and The New Mutants (TBA 2017-2018?). One item of potentially big X-Men: Apocalypse news for the panel came from producer Simon Kinberg’s Twitter earlier this week. Along with a very bald James McAvoy (as Professor X) and a very redheaded Sophie Turner (as Jean Grey), Kinberg is seen posing with pop superstar Taylor Swift. Although it’s possible Taylor Swift is just a really big X-Men fan, this image has led to speculation that she might appear in the movie as Marvel’s most famous mutant pop superstar: Dazzler. Although her look has changed in recent years, traditionally, Dazzler actually does sort of resemble Taylor Swift. The character first appeared in 1980 as part of a potential cross-promotion with Casablanca Records, with actual disco records to be released by the fictional character (those plans were cancelled, but Dazzler still made her debut anyway). If Taylor Swift really is going to be in X-Men: Apocalypse, expect to hear more about it very soon.2.&nbsp;WESLEY SNIPES MIGHT BE RETURNING AS MARVEL’S BLADE?While promoting the upcoming NBC show The Player at Comic-Con this week, Wesley Snipes revealed to various sources that he has had recent meetings with Marvel Studios to discuss whether or not Snipes might reunite with Marvel as the vampire hunter Blade. The surprise success of the first Blade movie in 1998 is often credited with helping start the modern wave of movies based upon Marvel Comics characters. It’s not known if Wesley Snipes would be starring in a Blade 4, as Blade in some other Marvel movie, or possibly in one of their Netflix shows. Snipes also left it open that perhaps he could be talking to Marvel about a completely different character (someone in Black Panther, perhaps?). We’re listing this story as one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because despite the popularity of the character, the three Blade movies all have Rotten Tomatometer scores (55%, 59%, and 26%, in order).1.&nbsp;PRINCE CHARMING IS THE LATEST DISNEY CHARACTER TO GET A LIVE ACTION REBOOTThe last few years have seen Walt Disney Pictures start development on so many live action movies based on their animated properties that it’s really getting easier to list which titles they don’t have in development yet. This week’s news concerns a character most associated with Cinderella who actually already appeared in this year’s Cinderella: Prince Charming is now in development to get his own live action movie. This Prince Charming, however, is described as a comedy project, and as such, it sounds like he will not be played by Richard Madden. Prince Charming was picked up by Walt Disney Pictures as a comedy spec script by screenwriter Matt Fogel, whose previous credit is the 2011 threequel Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son. That film’s (very) Rotten Tomatometer score of just 5% is why this is the week’s Most Rotten Idea.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"thriller, FX, international, fiction, women, godzilla, cancelled, superman, Schmidt, globes, Pirates, History, TIFF, anthology, Walt","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bat-Affleck.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-ben-affleck-will-direct-and-star-in-batman-solo-movie"},{"id":"47509197831643","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Disney’s Aladdin Gets A Live Action Prequel","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Disney's Aladdin Gets A Live Action PrequelPlus, new roles for Jennifer Lawrence, Reese Witherspoon, and Michael Cera, and Ennio Morricone teams up with Quentin Tarantino.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 17, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers seven days from the realm of film development (including two days of San Diego Comic-Con), and ten of the top movie news stories of the week. Included in the mix are headlines for such movies as Green Lantern Corps, Stephen King’s IT Part I, LEGO Batman, and Disney’s Genies and Wreck-It Ralph 2.This Week’s Top StoryALADDIN TO GET A LIVE ACTION PREQUEL IN GENIESThe week after Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment had the second biggest opening weekend ever for an animated feature, Walt Disney Pictures has announced plans for a live-action prequel with something of a similar theme. This week’s news is also part of the growing development slate (now past 10 movies in development!) of live action adaptations of characters from Walt Disney animated features. That’s because Walt Disney Pictures now has plans for a live-action prequel to Aladdin called Genies. In Genies, we will journey to the magical realm that genies come from, and discover how Aladdin’s genie (originally voiced by the late Robin Williams) came to be trapped in the lamp where Aladdin found him. The Genies prequel will be written by the screenwriting team of Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, who have previously worked on the horror franchise entries Freddy vs Jason, the 2009 reboot of Friday the 13th, and the not-yet-released movie version of Baywatch. The long-term plans are for the Genies prequel to eventually lead into a live-action remake of Aladdin, which will then function as a sequel to Genies. This plan is similar (though not exactly the same) to how next year’s Alice Through the Looking Glass (5/27/16) will be both a sequel and an adaptation. Walt Disney Pictures’ currently announced live action adaptations of their animated films also include The Jungle Book (4/15/16), Pete’s Dragon (8/12/16), Beauty and the Beast (3/17/17), Night on Bald Mountain, Dumbo, Prince Charming, Winnie the Pooh, and Mulan.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;JENNIFER LAWRENCE TO STAR IN ROMANTIC “DRAMEDY” THE ROSIE PROJECTThis happens every year, but sometimes, because of all the focus on San Diego for the four days of Comic-Con, other stories that come out are sort of lost in the wake. That, ostensibly, is what columns like the Weekly Ketchup are for, to help people “catch up” on news stories they may have missed. This year, the news story that is probably most examplary of that trend involves Jennifer Lawrence (who was actually at SDCC for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part II and X-Men: Apocalypse). Jennifer Lawrence has signed to star in a “romantic dramedy” being developed at Columbia Pictures called The Rosie Project. The dramedy is an adaptation of a book by Graeme Simsion, and is being adapted by Scott Neustadnter and Michael Weber, who are best known for their (500) Days of Summer screenplay. At one point, the directing team of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller had been eyeing directing The Rosie Project, but they have now moved on to focus instead on Star Wars Anthology: Star Wars and an animated Spider-Man movie. Jennifer Lawrence will star in The Rosie Project as a woman who confounds a genetics professor’s theories about what sort of woman should be his ideal mate.2.&nbsp;JOHN C. REILLY CONFIRMS THAT HE WILL RETURN FOR WRECK-IT RALPH 2When a movie earns over $470 million from a budget of $165 million, you would think a sequel would be obvious, almost non-news, and yet, it’s also because such movies were so popular that their sequels are big news. An example of that this week was Wreck-it Ralph 2, which John C. Reilly, who voiced the title character, confirmed this week that he is signed to return as Wreck-It Ralph. It’s not yet known what Wreck-It Ralph 2 will be about, but director Rich Moore has said in the past that we might see the sequel implementing more “mobile gaming” characters, and/or other versions of Wreck-It Ralph from other consoles or stages of video game history. There is no release date yet for Wreck-It Ralph 2, except that it probably won’t be before 2018, as it has to wait for its spot after other Walt Disney Animation Studios movies like Zootopia (3/4/16), Moana (11/23/16), Giants (3/9/18), and another sequel, Frozen 2.3.&nbsp;IT! DIRECTOR! MAMA!(Admittedly, that joke headline is probably funnier if you’ve seen the 2013 horror film Mama.) Ever since Mama out performed expectations in early 2013, Hollywood has collectively been trying to find the right next project for director Andy Muschietti. As of yet, the right movie hasn’t come together, but Muschietti does have a few films in development, including the video game adaptation Shadow of the Colossus. This week’s news might actually be Muschietti’s next, as it’s almost pretty much ready to go, following the recent departure of its previous director. That’s because Andy Muschietti is now in talks with New Line Cinema to direct at least the first movie in their two-part adaptation of Stephen King’s IT, about a group of kids terrorized by a subterranean being posing as a clown called Pennywise. Cary Fukunaga, the director best known for the first season of HBO’s True Detective, had been developing the two IT movies for some time, but dropped out in May over “vision and budget” issues. It’s not known if Fukunaga’s choice for Pennywise, We’re the Millers star Will Poulter, will still be cast as the evil clown, or if Muschietti will recast the role. It’s also unknown if Andy Muschietti will direct both films, or if another director will take over for the concluding film in which the childhood friends reunite as adults to finally confront Pennywise.4.&nbsp;ENNIO MORRICONE TO SCORE TARANTINO WESTERN THE HATEFUL EIGHTAlthough most of the hype out of San Diego Comic-Con last weekend involved capes and sequels, longtime attendee Quentin Tarantino was still able to make a few intriguing announcements about his next film, The Hateful Eight. The headline news is that QT has recruited acclaimed Italian film composer Ennio Morricone to provide the score for The Hateful Eight, which will be his first Western in over 40 years, since his work with Sergio Leone on films like A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Quentin Tarantino had previously used some of Ennio Morricone’s work on Inglourious Basterds, the score of which was something of a musical collage. Tarantino also revealed that The Hateful Eight was filmed using the same Ultra Panavision 70mm lens that was used to film Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia back in the 1960s (not similar lens, but the exact same set of lens). The Weinstein Company has scheduled The Hateful Eight for release on December 25, 2015 in 70mm (to be followed by a digital projection release in January, 2016).5.&nbsp;MICHAEL CERA TO VOICE ROBIN IN LEGO BATMANAlthough the live action DC Comics movies like next year’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad receive most of the press, Warner Bros also has another line of movies adapted from DC Comics. The success last year of The LEGO Movie has led to WB greenlighting a spinoff sequel for LEGO Batman (2/10/17). That movie will be directed by Robot Chicken director Chris McKay, and Will Arnett will reprise his role as Batman from The LEGO Movie. This week, we learned that Will Arnett will be joined by the voice talents of Michael Cera as his crimefighting partner Robin. What is not yet known is which Robin Cera will be playing (there have been several in the comics). LEGO Batman is being written by Seth Grahame-Smith (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies). In other Michael Cera news, the Arrested Development star has recently acquired the rights to the novel Masters of Atlantis by Charles Portis (who also wrote True Grit). Published in 1985 and set in the early 20th Century, Masters of Atlantis is a comedy about a young man who becomes involved with a cult centered around the lost continent of Atlantis. Michael Cera will be both producing and starring in Masters of Atlantis.6.&nbsp;REESE WITHERSPOON REMEMBERS THAT ALL IS NOT FORGOTTENReese Witherspoon is continuing to help guide her own career as an increasingly prolific producer, following last year’s success with Gone Girl and Wild, which Witherspoon also starred in. Other movies that Reese Witherspoon is producing through her Pacific Standard production company with an eye towards starring in include Ashley’s War (about female soldiers in Afghanistan) and a Peggy Lee biopic, but she added another project to her producing/starring slate this week. Pacific Standard and Warner Bros are partnering on developing an adaptation of the upcoming (2017) novel All is Not Forgotten. Although the book is still almost two years away from being published, the premise is described as being an “adult thriller about a teenage girl in picturesque suburban Connecticut who is brutally attacked and raped, and the secrets that emerge during the course of the investigation.” Reese Witherspoon is being courted by Warner Bros to play the girl’s mother, “who decides with her husband to give their daughter a pill to erase her short term memory so she won’t relive the trauma of the rape.” This project is now seeking a screenwriter and/or a director.7.&nbsp;CHRISTMAS LEGEND KRAMPUS IS BACK IN STYLEThe German/Swiss folklore monster “The Krampus” has been scaring young children around Christmas for hundreds of years, but for whatever reasons, the Krampus has mostly stayed under-adapted in modern Christmas fantasy stories. That’s about to change, with Universal Pictures and Legendary Pictures scheduling the horror comedy Krampus for December 4, 2015. And with that film potentially introducing the Krampus concept to the mainstream audience, now another film is being put into development. Walden Media (Chronicles of Narnia, Charlotte’s Web) and the Jim Henson Company are teaming up to produce Happy Krampus!, a family-friendly live action take on the Krampus legends. Happy Krampus! is expected to mark the feature film debut of short film director Kealan O’Rourke (The Boy in the Bubble), whose idea is the basis for this film. In this take on a Christmas story, Krampus is one of Santa Claus’ helpers, responsible for delivering the coal to the naughty children on Santa’s list. After losing his job because modern parents spoil their children, Krampus sets out to replace Christmas Day with his own Krampus Day.8.&nbsp;DC COMICS’ 2020 SUPERHERO MOVIE CONFIRMED TO BE GREEN LANTERN CORPSFollowing weeks of recent rumors that multiple actors will be cast as various Green Lantern heroes in future WB/DC Comics movies, the studio confirmed a title which allows for exactly that at San Diego Comic-Con last weekend. Part of their event on Saturday was the revelation that Warner Bros is indeed planning to reboot Green Lantern in 2020 with Green Lantern Corps, a title which references both the intergalactic force Green Lanterns work for, and a long-running DC Comics title. Under the Green Lantern Corps umbrella, there have been multiple Green Lanterns from Earth, and thousands from all over the galaxy at large. Two of the actors who have been recently rumored are Tyrese Gibson (possibly as John Stewart) and Chris Pine (in addition to playing Steve Trevor in Wonder Woman). There is not yet any screenwriter or directors for Green Lantern Corps (or another farther-out DC Comics movie, Cyborg).Rotten Idea of the Week1.&nbsp;JOHNNY DEPP MAY REPLACE HUGH JACKMAN IN COLLATERAL BEAUTYWithin a certain range, it’s a frequent refrain that the same group of actors are considered for roles repeatedly. Some of the stars who are sometimes mentioned together these days are Hugh Jackman, Johnny Depp, Robert Downey, Jr. and Matthew McConaughey. Until this week, Jackman had been attached to star in a movie called Collateral Beauty, as a New York executive experiencing depression following a personal tragedy who discovers an unusual way of (possibly) breaking out of his condition. This week, however, Jackman dropped out of the film because of scheduling conflicts with his third solo Wolverine for 20th Century Fox. Rooney Mara and Jason Segel are also attached to costar, and the producers are now looking to replace Hugh Jackman, with early talks now about to begin with Johnny Depp, who does not have a film this fall. Collateral Beauty will be directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (Me And Earl and the Dying Girl) from a script by Allan Loeb. Loeb’s nine-movie Rotten streak (which includes Just Go With It, The Dilemma, and So Undercover) is why this story is this week’s Rotten Idea.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Family, Hulu, AMC, Family, potter, archives, america","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Geenie.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-disneys-aladdin-gets-a-live-action-prequel"},{"id":"47509197825495","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Zach Galifianakis In Talks For LEGO Batman‘s Joker","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Zach Galifianakis In Talks For LEGO Batman's JokerPlus, new projects for Scorsese and DiCaprio, Liam Neeson, and Tom Hardy, as well as an LXG reboot and a possible Deadwood movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 14, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers ten top stories from the last seven days in the realm of film development news, all of those stories we hear about upcoming movies.&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about the TV adaptations Absolutely Fabulous, Baywatch, and Deadwood, and new movies for Leonardo DiCaprio, Zac Efron, and Tom Hardy.This Week’s Top StoryZACH GALIFIANAKIS CAST AS THE LEGO JOKERJared Leto has been attracting a lot of attention this year for his depiction of The Joker in next year’s Suicide Squad, but Leto isn’t the only star who will soon be portraying The Joker on the big screen.&nbsp; Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover) is now in talks with Warner Bros to provide the voice of The Joker&nbsp;in their LEGO Movie spinoff The LEGO Batman Movie.&nbsp; Likewise, it won’t be Ben Affleck who provides the voice of Batman, but rather, it will be Will Arnett, who also played Batman in The LEGO Movie.&nbsp; Michael Cera has also recently been cast to provide the voice of Batman’s sidekick, Robin.&nbsp; The LEGO Batman Movie will be directed by Chris McKay, who also worked as an animation supervisor on last year’s The LEGO Movie.&nbsp; Warner Bros has scheduled The LEGO Batman Movie for release on February 10, 2017.&nbsp; The LEGO Batman Movie is just one part of Warner Bros’ continuing plans for their LEGO franchise, which includes The LEGO Ninjago Movie (9/22/17) (and a possible Ninjago sequel), The LEGO Movie Sequel (5/18/18), and The Billion Brick Race, which will be codirected by Jason Segel.Fresh Developments This Week1. LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO MAKE SIXTH MOVIE WITH MARTIN SCORSESEDirector Martin Scorsese has collaborated with Robert De Niro for eight movies now, but Leonardo DiCaprio, who has been in five Scorsese films, is definitely getting close to at least tying De Niro’s record.&nbsp; This week, it was announced that Scorsese and DiCaprio are reuniting for what will be their sixth film working together. That film is the long-in-development adaptation of the Erik Larson non-fiction book, The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America.&nbsp; There was recently a studio auction for the rights to this package, and the winner was Paramount Pictures, which is in need of hot properties (as the studio is currently #5 in market share).&nbsp; Leonardo DiCaprio will play one of the most prolific serial killers in American history, Doctor H.H. Holmes, who is believed to have killed anywhere from 27 to over 200 people during Chicago’s World Fair of 1893.&nbsp; Holmes constructed “The World’s Fair Hotel,” which he was secretly using to lure his victims to their deaths, in “a haunt that had a gas chamber, crematorium and a dissecting table where Holmes would murder his victims and strip their skeletons to sell for medical and scientific study.”&nbsp; The Devil in the White City is being adapted by screenwriter Billy Ray (Captain Phillips, The Hunger Games).2.&nbsp;HBO MAY FINALLY RETURN TO&nbsp;DEADWOOD ONE LAST TIMEWhen HBO announced in 2008 that they were pulling the plug on the Emmy-winning series Deadwood after three seasons, it left many of the show’s fans frustrated.&nbsp; Based upon the true stories of the 1870s frontier town in South Dakota, Deadwood was left at the end of the third season in narrative midstream, with some of the town’s historically significant true stories (Custer’s Last Stand, for example) yet to be included.&nbsp; There was talk at the time that HBO might produce a movie or two for their channel to wrap up the remaining stories, but the years passed, and nothing happened.&nbsp; Fans of Al Swearengen (Ian McShane’s foul-mouthed pimp/businessman) were excited to hear, therefore, the news that HBO has begun “very preliminary discussions” about how to bring Deadwood back as a feature film.&nbsp; If HBO does finally give Deadwood its shot at a feature film, it will join such previous HBO adaptations as Sex and the City (and its sequel), Sacha Baron Cohen’s Brüno, and this year’s Entourage.&nbsp; There has also been talk over the years about a possible movie based upon HBO’s Rome.3.&nbsp;BRITISH TV SERIES ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS ALSO GETTING A MOVIEHBO isn’t the only TV channel that’s continuing to adapt their shows into being movies.&nbsp; This week saw the debut of the trailer for Dad’s Army, based on the popular BBC comedy series. And also this week, Fox Searchlight started negotiations with the BBC about boarding their plans for a feature film based upon the popular and long-running comedy series Absolutely Fabulous.&nbsp; That series about two middle-aged female friends (played by Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley) premiered in 1992, ran for three years, and was then revived for two more series in 2001, which was then followed by a few specials in 2011 and 2012.&nbsp; Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley are both expected to return, along with series regularly like Julia Sawalha and Jane Horrocks, and various celebrity cameos.4. LIAM NEESON TO STAR AS GENERAL MACARTHUR IN OPERATION CHROMITEAs one of the most prominent military leaders of the Pacific Campaign of World War II, General Douglas MacArthur has been portrayed dozens of times in film and television.&nbsp; The actors to play General MacArthur have included Gregory Peck (1977’s MacArthur), Sir Laurence Olivier (Inchon), Charlton Heston (TV’s Korea: The Unknown War), and recently, Tommy Lee Jones (Emperor).&nbsp; The next actor to join those high ranks is likely to be Liam Neeson, who is now in talks to star as General MacArthur in the Korean War drama Operation Chromite.&nbsp; The South Korean war drama will depict the events of the Battle of Inchon in 1950, which led to the recapture of Seoul, and was a strategic reversal for the United Nations’ allied forces.&nbsp;Operation Chromite will be directed by South Korean director John H. Lee, whose credits include A Moment to Remember, Sayonara Itsuka, and 71: Into the Fire.&nbsp; The production is being timed so that Operation Chromite can be released in South Korea in time for June 25, 2016, which will mark the 66th anniversary of the star of the Korean War.5.&nbsp;TOM HARDY LOADS HIS GUNS WITH 100 BULLETSFollowing successful hits with both Mad Max: Fury Road and 2012’s The Dark Knight Rises, Tom Hardy is becoming something of a box office force to be reckoned with.&nbsp; This week, the news broke that Hardy is returning to the corporate family behind both of those films as the producer of a feature film based upon a Vertigo Comics title. Tom Hardy will produce, and likely star, in New Line Cinema’s adaptation of the long-running series 100 Bullets. Also seen by some writers as a strong candidate to be adapted as a TV series, 100 Bullets (which ran for 100 issues from 1999 to 2009) was about “an enigmatic man named Agent Graves as he presents different people, for reasons unknown, with a gun, the identity of the person who ruined their lives … and a hundred rounds of untraceable ammunition.” Tom Hardy is expected to be the studio’s choice to play Agent Graves. New Line Cinema is also developing the Vertigo Comics adaptation Sandman (with Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and the DC Comics superhero adventure Shazam.6.&nbsp;ZAC EFRON JOINS DWAYNE JOHNSON FOR THE R-RATED BAYWATCH MOVIEWith only 6.7% of the 2015 market share to date, Paramount Pictures (along with Sony) is one of the studios that is under the most pressure to make big plans for the future. One of the movies that Paramount appears to be betting big on is their long-in-development adaptation of the hit 1970s TV show Baywatch. Having already recruited Dwayne Johnson for one of the film’s leads, this week, Paramount Pictures found his lifeguarding partner in the form of Zac Efron (Neighbors, High School Musical).&nbsp;Baywatch will tell the story of “a by-the-book and very serious lifeguard (Johnson) who is forced to team up with a young rule-flouting hothead (Efron) in order to save their beach from environmental destruction at the hands of an oil tycoon.” Seth Gordon (Horrible Bosses, Identity Thief) will direct Baywatch from a script most recently drafted by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift. In addition to working on Freddy vs Jason and the 2009 reboot of Friday the 13th, Shannon and Swift are also working on Disney’s Aladdin prequel called Genies. Filming of Baywatch is expected to start in early 2016 for release sometime in 2017, with what Dwayne Johnson confirmed this week will be an intended R rating, in Johnson’s words, “Like me when I drink.”7. Mark Wahlberg to be assigned a female buddy cop in&nbsp;PartnersOne of the big news stories last week was the announcement of release dates for both Bad Boys 3 (2/17/17) and Bad Boys 4 (7/3/19). (That was followed by a suggestion this week that Will Smith may only produce, and not star, in the sequels .)&nbsp; That news came from Sony Pictures, the studio whose two 21 Jump Street movies (along with Fox’s The Heat) suggest that there’s still very much a market for “buddy cop comedies.” And that right there might be why this week we learned that New Line Cinema has attached Mark Wahlberg to star in their buddy cop comedy called Partners.&nbsp; Compared to Mr. and Mrs Smith, Partners will follow an LAPD detective (Wahlberg) who finds that the woman he just had a one night stand with is also an FBI agent, and his superior on a high profile case they must work on together.&nbsp;Partners was written by Evan Turner, who has worked on ABC’s sitcom The Goldbergs. New Line Cinema is currently looking for a director, and Mark Wahlberg’s female costar.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN REBOOT TO HAVE IRONIC TITLE?Back in May, we first learned that 20th Century Fox has plans to reboot their adaptation of Alan Moore’s League of Extraordinary Gentlement comic book franchise after the failed attempt back in 2003.&nbsp; Earlier today, a quote from the project’s producer, John Davis, quickly became widespread, with varied interpretations. Davis was quoted as saying, “Just by going back to the roots and making it authentic to what the fan base was really excited about. It’s female-centric, which I think is interesting. I love female characters, point-of-view characters in action movies. I thought Mad Max [Fury Road] was great.” Some sources are interpreting that quote to suggest that the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen characters (which include the Invisible Man, Mr. Hyde, and Allan Quatermain) will be reimagined to become female characters, or new female characters will be added (similar to next year’s reboot of Ghostbusters). What’s also possible or likely is that John Davis was just referring to the fact that three of the characters Alan Moore uses most frequently as his protagonists are all female: Mina Murray, Orlando (who alternates between male and female), and Nemo’s daughter, Captain Janni Dakkar.&nbsp; We’re classifying this story as a “Rotten Idea” for now, based mostly on the Rotten 17% Tomatometer score that critics gave to the last time 20th Century Fox adapted League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.1.&nbsp;LEBRON JAMES CONFIRMS PLANS FOR SPACE JAM 2When Warner Bros released Looney Tunes: Back in Action in late 2003, it was considered a box office bomb. That movie’s financial failure presumably led to the 12 years absence of any live action/animated Looney Tunes movies. What the box office numbers don’t tell you, however, is that critically, Looney Tunes: Back in Action (59% Tomatometer) was actually better received&nbsp;than Space Jam (35% Tomatometer), the 1996 Looney Tunes basketball comedy (though both scores are Rotten overall). Regardless, there have been rumors the last few years that Warner Bros is developing a sequel to Space Jam (presumably because Space Jam earned $230 million globally despite the critical reception). The focus of those rumors has been on Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James, but until this week, there had been no confirmation (including even when his production company signed with WB last month). Avoiding the Hollywood trades and blogs that are usually the sources for such news, LeBron James instead went on NBC’s Today this morning to say this about Space Jam 2:&nbsp;“We hope so. We’re definitely missing Bugs and Daffy and Tasmanian Devil and every last one of them, so hopefully we can do some great things.” LeBron James made his feature film acting debut in last month’s Trainwreck, appearing alongside Amy Schumer. There’s no word yet what other NBA stars might join LeBron James in Space Jam 2.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"love, America, 4/20, critic, Awards, shows, Valentine's, Tour, PBS, Competition, VOD, romantic, cancelled, 2018, Larson","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ZachGalifianakisKetchup.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-zach-galifianakis-in-talks-for-lego-batmans-joker"},{"id":"47509199656427","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Steven Spielberg to Direct Ready Player One","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Steven Spielberg to Direct Ready Player OnePlus, new roles for Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, and Super Troopers 2 meets its crowdfunding goal in one day.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 27, 2015 |  CommentsThis was a week filled with news stories from the world of film development, and in this column, we bring to you at least ten of the biggest revelations. Included in the mix are stories about a possible Downton Abbey movie, remakes of A Star is Born and Alien Nation, and the latest entries in the LEGO Movie, Star Trek and Marvel Studios franchises.This Week’s Top StoryLOVE 1980S NOSTALGIA? STEVEN SPIELBERG TO DIRECT READY PLAYER ONELast year, the first time most people heard about the possibility of Ernest Cline’s book Ready Player One becoming a movie was when the news broke that Christopher Nolan had reportedly been offered the job of directing the movie. The fan reaction was polarized, with some reactions questioning whether Nolan was a perfect match for a story saturated with a sense of nostalgia for the 1980s (since there are popular directors who have sort of built a career on that). Warner Bros also had another obstacle looming over Ready Player One, which is that although they are a big studio with lots of licenses, there’s a lot of 1980s pop culture to which Warner Bros does *not* have the rights. And that, right there, is another reason Warner Bros has attached Steven Spielberg to direct their adaptation of Ready Player One. Ready Player One is now expected to be Spielberg’s third upcoming movie, after Bridge of Spies (10/16/15), and The BFG (7/1/16). This is also a big deal for Warner Bros, with Spielberg returning to the studio for the first time in 2014 (since A.I. Artificial Intelligence in 2001). With Spielberg now aboard, he presumably brings with him all of the films that he produced through Amblin Entertainment, plus potentially his own films as director. The impetus for this being an issue is that a big part of the book involves the 1983 film War Games, which neither Warner Bros nor Spielberg has rights to, so another 1980s movie will have to take its place. Ready Player One is something of a Who Framed Roger Rabbit? of pop/gaming/retro/geek culture. Set in 2044, the death of the creator of a massive virtual reality framework called OASIS leads to a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory worldwide search for clues to the Easter Eggs and keys which will unlock ownership to OASIS (which is also chased by corporate henchmen, ala The Matrix). And, in other Steven Spielberg news, Bill Hader also signed on this week to play one of the giants in The BFG.Fresh Developments This Week1 #SIXSEASONSANDAMOVIE… FOR DOWNTON ABBEY?Fans of former NBC series Community are assumedly familiar with the hashtag #sixseasonsandamovie which became closer to happening when Yahoo! Screen picked up the show for its sixth season. However, this week, a completely (and very) different show had two different things happen which now make it even closer to actually having “six seasons and a movie.” The show in question is the PBS phenomenon Downton Abbey, which was confirmed this week to have just one more season, its sixth, which will start airing in November, 2015. And that leads us to why Downton Abbey is even in a column about the movies, as Executive Producer Gareth Neame fielded a question this week about a Downton Abbey movie with, “Our position on that is we would be very interested in that. It is definitely something we’re contemplating. It would be great fun to do. I think it would be a wonderful extension of everything that people loved about the TV show, but I can’t confirm that it’s definitely going to happen.” So, he’s not saying it will happen, but there’s a chance. (And yes, we just made that connection.)2 IDRIS ELBA JOINS STAR TREK 3 AS THE ENTERPRISE’S NEXT ENEMYWith filming scheduled to start in June, we learned this week who might be one of the biggest starts to join the franchise with (the probably-to-be-retitled) Star Trek 3. Idris Elba is now in early talks to play the film’s villain. We don’t know anything about that character, but there are rumors that this film might heavily feature Klingons. Another possible hint came this week from screenwriter (and costar as Scotty) Simon Pegg, who said that this one will “take it forward with the spirit of the TV show… [and be about] frontierism and adventure and optimism and fun, and that’s where we want to take it, you know. Where no man has gone before — where no one has gone before, sensibly corrected for a more enlightened generation. But yeah, that’s the mood at the moment.” Some of that might also be a correction following Star Trek Into Darkness, which some fans felt went too far in trying to replicate the “spirit” of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. That wasn’t the only time this week, however, that Idris Elba made the news, as the British star is also now replacing Jamie Foxx in the Harmony Korine crime drama The Trap, along with Benicio Del Toro, James Franco, Al Pacino, and Robert Pattinson.3 JASON SEGEL JOINS LEGO MOVIE SPINOFF THE BILLION BRICK RACEBefore this week, there were already three LEGO movies in the works at Warner Bros, following the success last year of The LEGO Movie. There’s the LEGO Ninjago movie (9/23/16), The LEGO Batman Movie (5/26/17), and obviously, The LEGO Movie Sequel (5/25/18). This week, yet another movie was added to the LEGO movie roster, as Warner Bros hired actor/writer Jason Segel and screenwriter Drew Pearce (Iron Man 3) to cowrite a LEGO Movie spinoff called The Billion Brick Race. There’s no other details known about the premise, but based on the title, one could guess that it sounds like a car/racing movie, possibly in the vein of Wacky Races, but… with LEGO pieces and characters (again, just a guess/hunch). As shown in The LEGO Movie, there are a lot of themes within the LEGO Universe that can be incorporated in this.4 MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY TO TASTE THE BILLIONAIRE’S VINEGARMatthew McConaughey (and his agent) is making the most of the lingering good will following his awards for Dallas Buyers Club, True Detective, and the box office results of last year’s Interstellar. McConaughey has the Japanese suicide drama Sea of Trees in the can, the Civil War drama Free State of Jones filming, and the jungle adventure Gold potentially filming soon after. Matthew McConaughey added yet another project to his slate this week with another true story called The Billionaire’s Vinegar. Adapted from the Benjamin Wallace non-fiction book The Billionaire’s Vinegar: The Mystery of the World’s Most Expensive Bottle, the film will tell the story, starting in 1985, of the controversy surrounding bottles of wine claimed to have been from Thomas Jefferson’s secret stash in France. The story involves both members of the Forbes family, and billionaire Bill Koch (of “the Koch Brothers”), who spent over a million dollars investigating the validity of the wine’s purported history. The script for The Billionaire’s Vinegar is being adapted by the team of Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, whose credits include Wanted, 3:10 to Yuma, and the TV series Chicago Fire.5 WILL BEYONCE JOIN BRADLEY COOPER IN THE LATEST A STAR IS BORN?Next year will mark 50 years since the last movie remake of A Star is Born (the first three were in 1937, 1954, and 1976). It wasn’t supposed to take that long, as Warner Bros has been developing a new A Star is Born since at least the early 2000s, and the list of actors who have considered taking on the male lead have included Christian Bale, Tom Cruise, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will Smith. As of late, Clint Eastwood had been attached to direct, but this week we learned that his American Sniper star has instead landed the job. Bradley Cooper is now in talks to direct (his debut), produce, and star as the aging male “falling” star who falls in love with a woman whose career is on the upswing. Beyonce has been the top choice to star in this remake since the Will Smith years, and Warner Bros still hopes she will costar with Bradley Cooper.6 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL: RUMORS GALORE, AND OUR FIRST LOOKS AT DEADPOOL AND THE THINGAfter a sort of slow news week last time, this week was the opposite, with nearly 30 stories that could have otherwise been including in the Weekly Ketchup. And a lot of them involved Marvel Studios or 20th Century Fox’s adaptation of Marvel characters. Let’s go through these in order of the release dates for the related movies. First off, there was a rumor that Carol Danvers, AKA Captain Marvel, may have already been cast and will be one of the big surprises in May’s Avengers: Age of Ultron (5/1/15). Also this week, we got our first fairly decent glimpse of the face and rock-like body of The Thing in this summer’s Fantastic Four (8/7/15). More officially, Ryan Reynolds took to Twitter today to show off the full costume for Deadpool (2/12/16). A very big Marvel Studios production that starts filming soon is Captain America: Civil War (5/6/16), and there was news about “African extras” being cast, pretty much confirming some of the film will be set in Black Panther’s nation of Wakanda. As exciting as Black Panther’s debut will be, the biggest new character in that movie will almost certainly be Peter Parker, AKA Spider-Man. An early report suggests that Marvel has held an audition with 16 year old actor Mateus Ward (Showtime’s Weeds). Opening just three weeks later will be 20th Century Fox’s X-Men: Apocalypse (5/27/16), and Jennifer Lawrence told MTV News that after Apocalypse, she will be done playing Mystique. Director Bryan Singer also took to Twitter this week to announce that the latest actress to play Jubilee (there have been a few) will be newcomer Lana Condor, who doesn’t currently have any previous credits. There was also a rumor this week from Latino Review on Instagram that X-Men: Apocalypse will feature cameos from Halle Berry as Storm, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and in his debut, Channing Tatum as Gambit (before that movie premieres on 10/7/16). Finally, in director news, we learned this week that Joe and Anthony Russo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War) will follow those films with their third and fourth Marvel Studios movies, the two halves of Avengers: Infinity War Part 1 (5/4/18) and Part 2 (5/3/19). Finally, there was a rumor (and speculation) that director Adam McKay (the Anchorman movies, Step Brothers), following his screenplay work on Ant-Man, may be lined up to direct a movie as well. Excluding movies that already have directors, and the rest of Marvel’s upcoming slate for various reasons, Latino Review came up with the remaining possibility being Inhumans (7/12/19), which Marvel might be imagining as their next comedy adventure, in the spirit of Guardians of the Galaxy.Rotten Ideas of the Week3 THAT SOUR MILK YOU LIKE IS COMING BACK IN STYLE… THE ALIEN NATION REMAKEBefore Neill Blomkamp ever directed the quasi-Short Circuit remake Chappie, he first emerged on the scene with District 9, which was arguably a quasi-Alien Nation remake. That’s right, Alien Nation, the now-overlooked 1988 science fiction movie with James Caan and Mandy Patinkin set in a near-future after a ship full of 300,000 alien slaves lands on Earth. The movie wasn’t a huge hit, but the fledgling FOX channel was desperate for TV shows, so Alien Nation got its own series, and a series of TV movies. And now, over 25 years later, 20th Century Fox is developing a remake of Alien Nation. The Alien Nation remake will be written by the screenwriting team of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, who were one half of the credited writers on Iron Man, and also cowrote Punisher: War Zone (they’re also working on the Highlander remake). The original Alien Nation has a Rotten Tomatometer rating of 54%, Iron Man is Certified Fresh at 93%, and Punisher: War Zone has a Rotten rating of just 27%.2 THIS WEEK IN OSCAR BAIT NEWS… WAIT, IS THAT HOWARD FROM THE BIG BANG THEORY?The CBS comedy The Big Bang Theory is currently at the start of a three-year deal which extends it until the 2016-2017 season, but that apparently isn’t stopping its stars from getting extra work in between seasons. (Having a show on CBS certainly doesn’t stop Mike &amp; Molly star Melissa McCarthy from having a movie career.) We mostly hear about Jim Parsons getting work (such as voicing the alien lead in this weekend’s Home), but this week, the news is all about Simon Helberg, who plays Howard on the show. Helberg has joined Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant in the period piece musical dramedy Florence Foster Jenkins. The movie will be set in early 20th Century New York City and will tell the story of a wealthy “blue blood” woman (Streep) who uses her wealth to establish a career as a singer, even though she has no actual talent. Helberg will play her pianist “Cosme McCoon,” and Grant will play Streep’s butler and best friend. Florence Foster Jenkins will be directed by Stephen Frears, whose critical high points include Philomena, Tamara Drewe, The Queen, and High Fidelity, and whose low points include Lay the Favorite, Cheri, The Van, The Hi-Lo Country, and Mary Reilly. And here’s what Simon Helberg’s own Tomatometer looks like.1 SUPER TROOPERS 2 CROWDFUNDED IN ONE DAYIt’s a meme as old as Fatty Arbuckle, but especially when it comes to comedy, reactions are sometimes polarized between critics and “regular folks.” Take, for example, the 2002 indie comedy Super Troopers, which premiered at Sundance and was quickly picked up by Harvey Weinstein. The Tomatometer rating for Super Troopers is a Rotten 35% (hence this story sitting here), but the Audience Score is 90% “liked it.” The latter probably explains how and why after just one day on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo, Super Troopers 2 reached its initial “greenlight” goal of $2 million, the day after it was confirmed that 20th Century Fox had picked up distribution rights to the sequel. Having said that, the Broken Lizard guys are quick to point out that $2 million was just the bare minimum, and that with more money, they can hire more “real Hollywood actors,” etc. The Indiegogo profile also suggests that additional funds will help secure a wide release for the sequel. As for why this is the Rotten Idea of the Week, here’s a link to director Jay Chandrasekhar’s RT profile page, where none of his films as director have ever received a Fresh rating.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"docudrama, Book, Movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/spielberg.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-steven-spielberg-to-direct-ready-player-one"},{"id":"47509199658476","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Joseph Gordon-Levitt Will Star in Fraggle Rock","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Joseph Gordon-Levitt Will Star in Fraggle RockPlus, a Star Wars rumor, a new Little Women, new roles for Keanu Reeves and Tatiana Maslany, and more.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 20, 2015 |  CommentsThis week included St. Patrick’s Day, the start of March Madness, three Rotten movies opening in wide release, and a lot less big news stories than we’re usually used to seeing. So, Fraggle Rock was the biggest confirmed news story, though there was also a big Star Wars rumor, news about remakes of Blue Thunder and Little Women, and new roles for Josh Gad, Jim Carrey, and Keanu Reeves.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryJOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT TO STAR IN FRAGGLE ROCKFirst off, we should note that, after a week full of big news items, this week was sort of the exact opposite. And so, seven days after the top story was the Frozen sequel, the top story this week might have been the news that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is going to produce and star in Fraggle Rock. (Fraggle Rock was, of course, a Jim Henson-produced show that ran on HBO for five seasons from 1983 to 1987). The Fraggle Rock movie is being described as “live action” but presumably, the Fraggles, Doozers and Gorgs will themselves continue to be muppets (though this point is unclear). The Fraggle Rock movie has been in development since 2011, and currently has no director or screenwriter.Fresh Developments This Week1 THIS WEEK IN STAR WARS RUMORS: J.J. ABRAMS MIGHT DIRECT EPISODE IX?This story is, at this point, a straight-up rumor, so take it as such. Having said that, the site it’s from (Latino Review) has been scoring more hits than misses lately (such as that crazy story about Spider-Man joining the MCU), so that’s also worth considering. It’s a simple concept to report, too: Lucasfilm is considering having J.J. Abrams also direct Star Wars Episode IX (expected in 2019) after also directing this December’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens (AKA Episode VII). Considering how little we know about Episode VII, it would be sort of crazy to start speculating what the movie two episodes after it might be about.2 KEANU REEVES AND JIM CARREY JOIN JASON MOMOA IN THE BAD BATCHWe’ve known for a while that Jason Momoa (AKA Aquaman, Conan, and Khal Drogo) was going to be starring in a “dystopian Texas” drama called The Bad Batch. This week, however, the size of the known cast was quintupled. Keanu Reeves will follow his comeback in John Wick playing “The Dream,” and Jim Carrey will follow his would-be-comeback in Dumb and Dumber To by playing “The Hermit.” Diego Luna (Y Tu Mama Tambien) and Suki Waterhouse (The Divergent Series: Insurgent) have also landed roles. The Bad Batch will be directed by Ana Lily Amirpour, whose film A Girl Walks Home at Night was billed as the world’s first Iranian vampire movie western. Filming begins next month in Los Angeles, so now we know what a “dystopian Texas” would look like.3 AMY PASCAL’S POST-SONY-CEO PLANS INCLUDE A REMAKE OF LITTLE WOMENIt’s only been a few months since former Sony CEO Amy Pascal departed following the hacking scandal surrounding The Interview, but in that time, she’s been busy arguably making more female-centric decisions than a similar amount of time in her old job would have produced. Among the movies Amy Pascal is now producing for Sony are the female-centric Ghostbusters, the Barbie franchise, and the musical Girls Like Us, about the early careers of Carole King, Joni Mitchell, and Carly Simon. Pascal’s latest project was revealed this week to be a new adaptation of the classic Louisa May Alcott novel, Little Women, coming over 20 years since the 1994 movie featuring Winona Ryder and Kirsten Dunst. This new Little Women will be adapted by Sarah Polley (Away from Her, Take This Waltz, Stories We Tell), who may eventually also sign on to direct (though she hasn’t yet). Another new literary adaptation for Sony this week is Verona, which is described as a retelling of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet “through a lens of an epic, 300-style world.” Yes, as in Zack Snyder and Frank Miller’s 300.4 TIME TRAVEL ADVENTURE CHRONONAUTS NEXT FROM CREATOR OF WANTED AND KICK-ASSIn addition to recently helping 20th Century Fox with their adaptations of Marvel’s X-Men and Fantastic Four, comic book writer Mark Millar has developed a fairly impressive filmography of adaptations of his own comics. This has included Wanted, Kick-Ass, Kick-Ass 2, and recently, Kingsman: The Secret Service. Those titles were joined this week by Chrononauts, about a pair of time travelling adventurers, which is now in development at Universal Pictures by producer Chris Morgan, who previously worked with Mark Millar on Wanted. Mark Millar also has adaptations of his comics Starlight and Superior in development at 20th Century Fox.5 ORPHAN BLACK STAR TO PLAY ONE THIRD OF TWO LOVERS AND A BEARCanadian director Kim Nguyen first really made his mark with the 2012/2013 indie film War Witch, and he’s now preparing for his next film, this time with two more famous stars. Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Dane DeHaan (Chronicle, The Amazing Spider-Man 2) have signed to play the titular lovers in Two Lovers and a Bear. DeHaan and Maslany will play a romantic couple who are forced to battle the elements in Canada’s remote Arctic wilderness. A fourth season of Orphan Black hasn’t been announced yet, but if there is one, it would start filming after Tatiana Maslany wraps filming of Two Lovers and a Bear.6 FROZEN STAR JOSH GAD CAST AS LE FOU IN BEAUTY AND THE BEASTWalt Disney Pictures is spacing out casting announcements for their live action remake of Beauty and the Beast. First, there was Emma Watson as Belle, and then Dan Stevens as the Beast, and Luke Evans as Gaston. This week, things sped up considerably, starting with the news that Frozen star Josh Gad has been cast as Gaston’s fumbling sidekick Le Fou. A few days later, this was joined by the news of Emma Thompson being cast as Mrs. Potts, and Kevin Kline as Belle’s father Maurice. Walt Disney Pictures has scheduled Bill Condon’s live action remake of their musical Beauty and the Beast for St. Patrick’s Day, March 17, 2017.7 KONG: SKULL ISLAND DIRECTOR TO ADAPT SCI-FI CLASSIC THE STARS MY DESTINATIONPerhaps it’s because YA adaptations are so popular these days, but Hollywood retains something of a fascination with acquiring the feature film rights to classic science fiction novels. Isaac Asimov’s The Foundation series and Fantastic Voyage have been in development for years at 20th Century Fox, and just two weeks ago, the same studio made the news with plans for Robert A. Heinlein’s The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. This week, Paramount Pictures jumped in the game with plans for an adaptation of the 1957 Alfred Bester novel The Stars My Destination. Paramount has signed director Jordan Vogt-Roberts to adapt the novel, after he finishes work on next year’s Kong: Skull Island for Universal Pictures. The Stars My Destination is something like The Count of Monte Cristo set in the solar system of the 25th century, as a man who is the sole survivor of an attack, inspiring him to engage in an ambitious plot of revenge. This isn’t, however, the first time someone has tried to make a movie out of The Stars My Destination, as Richard Gere had the rights back in the early 1990s.8 BLUE THUNDER TO GET A DRONE-ERA REMAKEAlthough MGM is normally the studio that is most associated with remakes, Sony Pictures is definitely stepping up their game when it comes to revisiting old movie properties. One such example this week is Sony’s new plan to remake the 1983 cop movie Blue Thunder, in which Roy Scheider starred as the pilot of a military helicopter operated by the Los Angeles Police Department. Sony’s remake will reimagine the concept to be about a drone helicopter. The Blue Thunder remake script will be adapted by Craig Kyle, a former Marvel producer who will make his feature film debut as a screenwriter with 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok. The remake will also be produced by Dana Brunetti, whose films include The Social Network, Captain Phillips, and Fifty Shades of Grey.Rotten Idea of the Week1 GUY RITCHIE’S KING ARTHUR GETS COMPETITION FROM MAN AT ARMSNature may abhor a vacuum, but what Hollywood really abhors is a vacuum-plus-one. That dictum may seem to apply to sequels (and it does), but in the context of this story, we’re talking about dueling movies. “Dueling Movies” is that phenomenon where competing studios make very similar movies at nearly the same time, and release them near each other. The world has known for a while now that Guy Ritchie and Warner Bros have ambitious plans for a six-movie franchise that will start on July 22, 2016 with Knights of the Round Table: King Arthur, but such a movie also takes a long time to produce. Enough time, that is, for a competitor to rush a less expensive movie through production and actually potentially beat Guy Ritchie’s movie to the cineplex. That may (or may not, admittedly) be what is in the works this week as we learned that director Jonathan Liebesman is attached to direct Man at Arms, about Sir Lancelot as an older man attempting to make up for totally ruining that whole Camelot thing by messing around with Guinevere. Liebesman’s filmography includes such gems as Darkness Falls (9%), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (12%), Battle: Los Angeles (35%), and last year’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (21%). Now all we need is for Sony to finally get Masters of the Universe going for 2016 so Man at Arms can get competition from this guy.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Channel, Television, canceled, Purge, drama, Discovery, mockumentary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/joseph-gordon-levitt.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-joseph-gordonlevitt-will-star-in-fraggle-rock"},{"id":"47509199621604","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Charlize Theron Will Spy for John Wick Directors","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Charlize Theron Will Spy for John Wick DirectorsPlus, new roles for Tom Hanks, Anne Hathaway, and Dwayne Johnson, and remakes of The Craft and The Fugitive.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 15, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers seven days of film development, which this week included the first three days of the Cannes Film Festival, which every year is the source for many such movie news stories. Included in the mix this week are stories about such movies as The New Mutants, Underworld 5, a remake of The Craft, a new Fugitive, and new roles for Tom Hanks, Anne Hathaway, Dwayne Johnson, and Charlize Theron.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryCHARLIZE THERON FOLLOWS IN KEANU’S FOOTSTEPS WITH JOHN WICK DIRECTORSThis story’s headline was a tricky one to compose, because really, we wanted to sell it as if Charlize Theron really needs anyone’s help to become an action movie star. This is, however, also the day that Mad Max: Fury Road, is opening with a Certified Fresh 99% Tomatometer rating, with much praise indeed going directly to Ms. Theron herself. Of course, Keanu Reeves had been in several pretty good action movies too, and yet, John Wick was still celebrated as his “return.” Anyway, yes, Charlize Theron and co-directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski will be teaming up for their follow-up to John Wick, which will be called The Coldest City. Charlize Theron will be playing a super spy who has an adventure following the assassination of an underground British agent just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Filming is scheduled to start in October in Germany. Leitch and Stahelski are expected to follow The Coldest City with both John Wick 2 and the comic book adaptation Bloodshot.Fresh Developments This Week1 X-MEN TEEN DRAMA SPINOFF THE NEW MUTANTS ANNOUNCEDIt’s been known for a while that 20th Century Fox has had plans for spinoffs of their successful X-Men franchise, including solo movies for Deadpool (2/12/16) and Gambit (10/7/16), and talk of an X-Force team movie. This week, the news broke that one of the potentially most promising spinoffs will indeed be the long-rumored title The New Mutants, which 20th Century Fox has hired director Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars) to co-write and direct. In a few ways, The New Mutants might be the most appropriate property 20th Century Fox could have chosen, as like the planned movie, it was itself Marvel’s first (of many that followed) X-Team spinoff series when it launched in 1982. With The New Mutants, the focus was less on students that moonlighted as superheroes, and more on characters who really were students first and foremost but whose mutant natures also frequently forced them into having adventures, teen romances, and journeys of self-discovery. For the most part, the core team of The New Mutants has not really been featured in Fox’s movies previously, which may have been a clue all along that the studio was planning on someday making the movie. Of course, the question that still lingers is exactly what relationship The New Mutants will have to Fox’s plans for an X-Force movie, since in the comics, the original X-Force team actually grew out of The New Mutants (which suggests that the X-Force movie might indeed be a sequel to The New Mutants).2 ANNE HATHAWAY TO STAR IN JAPANESE GIANT KAIJU MONSTER MOVIE COLOSSALNormally, you would think that this particular story would have been picked up by the nerdosphere and become one of the most popular stories in your Facebook feed, but for whatever reason, it sort of fell through the cracks. Well, that’s why the world has the Weekly Ketchup: to pick up those little overlooked stories, dust them off, and let them fly away again into the collective ether. The movie we’re talking about is Colossal, which will feature Anne Hathaway as a woman who moves back home after losing her job and fiance in New York City, only to find that as “a giant lizard is destroying the city of Tokyo, Gloria gradually comes to realize that she is strangely connected to these far-off events via the power of her mind.” Colossal will be directed by Nacho Vigalondo (Timecrimes) from his own script, and is being compared (for obvious reasons) to such movies as Godzilla, Adaptation, and Being John Malkovich. It’s not yet known if the Kaiju monster in Colossal will be realized using computer animation or a more classic “man-in-rubber-suit” technology.3 TOM HANKS AND EX MACHINA STAR ALICIA VIKANDER HEADLINE THE CIRCLEOne of this young year’s best reviewed genre movies has been Ex Machina (Certified Fresh 91%), and this week, the film’s star landed another lead role. Alicia Vikander will star in The Circle, along with Tom Hanks, as a “a recent college graduate who gets a job at a powerful tech company called The Circle. While there, she strikes up a relationship with the company’s charismatic co-founder.” The Circle is an adaptation of the 2013 novel by Dave Eggers (Away We Go). Tom Hanks also starred in the adaptation of Eggers’ book A Hologram for the King, which Lionsgate acquired the rights to this week at Cannes. The Circle will be directed by James Ponsoldt (The Spectacular Now), whose next film The End of the Tour premiered at Sundance this year, and is scheduled for release on July 31, 2015.4 DWAYNE JOHNSON ENLISTED IN SCI-FI COMEDY ALPHA SQUAD SEVENFollowing a bidding war with other production companies, DreamWorks has won the rights to a science fiction comedy pitch called Alpha Squad Seven. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is attached to co-produce and star (along with another lead) in the secretive comedy, which is reportedly set in space, drawing comparisons to Armageddon, Independence Day, and Guardians of the Galaxy (because publicists never use unsuccessful movies as examples of what their movie’s like). Alpha Squad Seven was pitched by the screenwriting team of Jeremiah Friedman and Nick Palmer, who don’t yet have a produced film to their credit, but have worked in the past on the sequel to the remake of The Karate Kid (the one that was actually about kung fu).Rotten Ideas of the Week5 THIS WEEK IN 1990S REMAKES: THE CRAFTIf you grew up in the 1980s, you’ve probably gotten used to Hollywood remaking some of your favorite movies since, well, the late 1990s or so. This is apparently something that surprises and/or shocks younger fans who grew up in the 1990s, though, as the Twitterverse demonstrated this week when Sony Pictures announced it had begun development on a remake of The Craft. Director Leigh Janiak, who made her feature film debut last year with the horror film Honeymoon (70% Fresh), has been hired to direct from a script that she will cowrite with her Honeymoon cowriter Phil Graziadei. We’re calling this news a borderline Rotten Idea, not specifically because of anything directly related to the Tomatometer, but because maybe the Twitterverse does have a point. The Craft is still out there, waiting to be enjoyed by generations to come (just like most movies that get remade by Hollywood).4 TWELVE YEARS SINCE SHANGHAI KNIGHTS… READY FOR SHANGHAI DAWN?Here at the Weekly Ketchup, we are big fans of tropes (well, really I’m one guy, but “we” sounds better), like one known as the Sequel Gap. A sequel gap occurs when a sequel is finally produced and released after a longer than average period of time. The three years each between Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron and Taken 2 and 3 were sort of optimal, but the 11 years in between the two SpongeBob SquarePants movies? That was quite a Sequel Gap. When Shanghai Noon (79% Fresh) and its sequel Shanghai Knights (66% Fresh) were released in 2000 and 2003, they were received positively for what they were: lighthearted action-comedy romps that mixed the Wild West and kung fu. But that was over 12 years ago, and Jackie Chan is 61 years old now. Regardless, MGM has announced plans to finally move ahead with a third movie in the franchise, to be called Shanghai Dawn. No other details are available yet, except that MGM is seeking a screenwriter, and hopes to release Shanghai Dawn sometime in 2017.3 PAN STARS HUGH JACKMAN AND ROONEY MARA REUNITING FOR COLLATERAL BEAUTYHugh Jackman and Rooney Mara, who will be costarring together later this year as Blackbeard and Tiger Lily in Pan, are now signed to costar in another movie. Hugh Jackman will star in Collateral Beauty as an advertising agent who experiences a tragedy that sends him into a state of depression. Collateral Beauty will be directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (Me and Earl and the Dying Girl) from an original screenplay by screenwriter Allan Loeb. Although Me and Earl and the Dying Girl was a critical hit at Sundance this year, we’re calling this one a “Rotten Idea” based on screenwriter Allan Loeb’s streak of “Rotten” Tomatometer ratings, which is currently eight in a row, including recent misfires like Rock of Ages, Here Comes the Boom, and 2012’s So Undercover, starring Miley Cyrus.2 KATE BECKINSALE TO RETURN AS SELENE IN UNDERWORLD 5Although she did skip the third movie (for the obvious reason that Underworld: Rise of the Lycans was a prequel), Kate Beckinsale did reprise her role as Selene in the fourth movie in the Underworld franchise, 2012’s Underworld: Awakening. And this week, we learned that Screen Gems and Sony Pictures are moving forward with plans for a fifth Underworld movie with Beckinsale returning once again. Theo James, who also starred in Underworld: Awakening will also reprise his character in this fifth movie. This fifth installment will mark the feature film directorial debut of Anna Foerster, who has worn a few different hats on other movies, including working as Roland Emmerich’s cinematographer on Anonymous and White House Down. We should note that this being a “Rotten Idea” really has nothing to do with Kate Beckinsale herself. No, this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because none of the previous Underworld movies ever scored higher than 31% on the Tomatometer.1 THEM: WE WANT TO REMAKE/SEQUELIZE THE FUGITIVE! US: WE DON’T CARE!A growing trend within Hollywood’s film development movers and shakers is the regurgitation and/or revisitation of Harrison Ford’s earlier film career. Ford himself will revisit his roles for Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Blade Runner 2 (presumably Deckard is who Ford’s playing, at least), and there’s recently been talk about Chris Pratt taking over the Indiana Jones franchise. We can now add The Fugitive (which was itself an adaptation of a popular 1960s TV series) to the mix, as Warner Bros has put a new Fugitive movie into development. There’s still a lot that we don’t know, however, such as whether the new movie will be a remake or a sequel. Whatever it is, Warner Bros has hired not-yet-produced screenwriter Christina Hodson to work on the screenplay. Although the 1993 movie starring Harrison Ford is Certified Fresh at 93%, the 1997 attempt to spinoff the franchise focusing on Tommy Lee Jones’ character, U.S. Marshals, is decidedly not, with a Rotten score of just 27%.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Turner, Dead, lee, razzies, Endgame, Comedy, Stephen, comics, visit, diversity, awards, Oscars, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/charlize-theron-directors.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-charlize-theron-will-spy-for-john-wick-directors"},{"id":"47509199615458","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Chris Pine Joins DC’s Wonder Woman","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Chris Pine Joins DC's Wonder WomanPlus, new roles for Woody Harrelson, Anne Hathaway, Alicia Vikander, and Tilda Swinton.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 29, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers the post-Memorial Day weekend in Hollywood and film development news, which included stories about such films as Assassin’s Creed, Bourne 5, Doctor Strange, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Wonder Woman.This Week’s Top Story&nbsp;This Week’s Top StorySuperman has Lois Lane, Superboy had Lana Lang, and Wonder Woman has military man Steve Trevor, who in many versions of her origin is the outsider who first discovers the Amazons on Paradise Island. This week, we learned that the role of Steve Trevor in Warner Bros and DC Comics’ long-awaited adaptation of Wonder Woman (6/23/17) will be none other than Chris Pine, who is now in talks. If Chris Pine does sign on to join Gal Gadot, it will be the third franchise for the actor, after his two (and soon, three) Star Trek films as Captain Kirk, and one reboot attempt with Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Wonder Woman will be directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster), who came aboard the superhero adaptation after the departure of Breaking Bad director/producer Michelle MacLaren. Chris Pine reportedly won the role of Steve Trevor after the studio tested a few other actors, including Scott Eastwood, who instead was cast in a supporting role in DC Comics’ Suicide Squad.Fresh Developments This Week1 LAURA DERN AND WOODY HARRELSON JOIN GRAPHIC NOVEL ADAPTATION WILSONThe movie industry is so obsessed and pre-occupied these days with every little movement from the successful world of superhero comic book adaptations that people might be forgiven if they forget that there have been comic book adaptations that have nothing to do with DC or Marvel, or superheroes at all. For example, there’s indie comics writer and artist Daniel Clowes, whose books inspired both Ghost World and Art School Confidential. Laura Dern and Woody Harrelson are now in talks to star in the Daniel Clowes graphic novel adaptation Wilson, which will be produced by Alexander Payne (Sideways, The Descendants). Wilson will be directed by Craig Johnson, who recently directed the indie hit The Skeleton Twins. Harrelson will star as the title character, “a middle-aged misanthrope… who seeks out his ex-wife (Dern), a scarred drug abuser, after the death of his father. When he learns of a teenaged daughter, born after his divorce, he tries to force them all to join him in his last gasping stab at a family.” Filming is scheduled to start on Wilson in Minneapolis in June.2 ANNE HATHAWAY TO STAR IN THE LIFEBOAT FOR ATONEMENT DIRECTORBritish director Joe Wright made his feature film debut in 2005 with Pride and Prejudice, followed in 2007 by Atonement, which was nominated for seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture), and won for Best Original Score. Wright’s next film will be the J.M. Barrie adaptation Pan (10/9/15), but the director is already looking for his next project. Wright is in talks with Focus Features to direct their adaptation of the Charlotte Rogan historical novel The Lifeboat. Anne Hathaway is already attached to star as a young newlywed who survives the sinking of an ocean liner in 1914 only to find herself on trial for murder because of events that unfolded on the over-crowded lifeboat while awaiting rescue. The Lifeboat was adapted by screenwriter William Broyles, Jr, whose filmography includes another film about survival at sea, Cast Away.3 EX MACHINA STAR ALICIA VIKANDER WANTED FOR BOTH BOURNE AND ASSASSIN’S CREEDFollowing the surprise success of this spring’s science fiction film Ex Machina, that film’s star Alicia Vikander has become one of the most in-demand young talents of the year thus far. This was demonstrated this week by the news that Vikander is in talks to costar in both the videogame adaptation Assassin’s Creed (along with Michael Fassbender) and the fifth Bourne movie (with Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass). The Swedish actress had been expected to join Tom Hanks in the tech company drama The Circle, but in the interest of Assassin’s Creed and Bourne 5, Vikander may depart The Circle, possibly to be replaced in the role by Emma Watson.4 JUNO DIRECTOR JASON REITMAN JOINS ANIMATED BEEKLE FOR DREAMWORKSAfter two critically disappointing films (Labor Day and Men, Women &amp; Children) recently, director Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air) appears to be interested in mixing things up a bit. Reitman is teaming up with DreamWorks Animation’s new leadership on an animated adaptation of the children’s book The Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friend, by author Dan Santat. The Beekle adaptation is the first project to start development under DreamWorks Animation’s new leadership following a few years of films that were seen as box office disappointments, such as Rise of the Guardians, Turbo, and Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman. DreamWorks Animation’s next release will be Kung Fu Panda 3 (1/29/16).5 SPY KIDS DIRECTOR TAKES ON RETRO CARTOON ADAPATION JONNY QUESTEvery once in a while, a spoof or parody comes along that actually transcends in popularity (at least for a while) the original subject that was being spoofed. That’s arguably what happened in the 2000s as the Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim hit The Venture Bros became one of the network’s most popular shows. The Venture Bros is inspired by other sources, but for those who know what to looking for, it’s easy to see that the characters and stories are takes on the 1960s animated adventure show Jonny Quest. The idea of adapting Jonny Quest as a big budget live action adventure has been bouncing around at Warner Bros for several years, including a time (much earlier in his career) when Zac Efron’s name was frequently mentioned (he’s considerably aged out of the role since). The Jonny Quest adaptation received new life this week as Spy Kids franchise creator and director Robert Rodriguez has now joined the project. Critically, Rodriguez’s filmography has been all over the map, from highs like the Certified Fresh first two Spy Kids movies, Sin City, and Machete, to critical misfires like the third and fourth Spy Kids movies, Machete Kills, and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D.6 LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN GETS ANOTHER SHOT AT SUCCESSIt was only 12 years ago, but the climate and approach to comic book adaptations was very different in some ways in 2003 when 20th Century Fox released The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (AKA LXG). Adapted from a very popular mini-series by writer Alan Moore, LXG was considered by most as a critical and box office flop, and by fans of Alan Moore’s series as something of a travesty. Twelve years later, there’s now a Showtime series in its second season, Penny Dreadful, which has borrowed a similar premise (fictional characters in Victorian England who team up to fight supernatural menaces), and has been well received. It’s therefore perhaps not surprising that 20th Century Fox has started development on a new adaptation of Moore’s original League of Extraordinary Gentlemen series. If the remake hews close to Moore’s story, it will feature the characters Captain Nemo, Allan Quatermain, Mina Murray (from Dracula), The Invisible Man, Jekyll/Hyde, and distinctly, not “Tom Sawyer,” who was an addition for the first movie that did not appear in Moore’s team. Most recently, Fox had been attempting to adapt League of Extraordinary Gentlemen as a TV series (right around the same time that Penny Dreadful was in development), but the show was never greenlit past the pilot stage. The remake script is being adapted by Jayson Rothwell, whose credits to date are mostly direct-to-video films like Second-in-Command, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.7 TILDA SWINTON CAST AS THE ANCIENT ONE IN MARVEL’S DOCTOR STRANGEIn the comics, the origin story of Marvel’s Doctor Strange (11/4/16) heavily involves a mysterious Tibetan mystic called The Ancient One, who lives high in the Himalayas and instructs injured surgeon Stephen Strange in the art of sorcery. A few months ago, there was an (unconfirmed) story that three of the actors Marvel Studios was considering for the key role of The Ancient One were Bill Nighy, Morgan Freeman, and Ken Watanabe. Instead, the news broke this week that Marvel is now in negotiations with British actress Tilda Swinton to take the role. It’s worth mentioning at this point that Marvel Studios does have something of a gender equality problem in their movies (the number of cinematic Avengers, for example, is now at 10, but only two of them are women). However, what many in social media remarked about this week is that Marvel Studios is casting a caucasian actress for what is traditionally an Asian role. If Tilda Swinton does take on the role of The Ancient One (and the character is still male), it won’t be her first encounter with gender-bending, as she also starred in the 1992 adaptation of Virginia Woolf’s Orlando. Swinton won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2007’s Michael Clayton, and has also been nominated four separate times for a Screen Actors Guild award.Rotten Ideas of the Week2 TWILIGHT DIRECTOR TO ADAPT YA NOVEL LOVE LETTERS TO THE DEADAfter making an impressive directorial debut with 2003’s Thirteen, director Catherine Hardwicke has since had a much rougher time with critics, as none of her five films since have scored a Fresh Tomatometer score. Those films included Lords of Dogtown (55%), The Nativity Story (38%), and most famously, the first Twilight movie (48%). This week, the news broke that Catherine Hardwicke is in talks with Fox 2000 and the Temple Hill production company to direct another movie with a similar audience, namely the adaptation of the 2014 YA novel Love Letters to the Dead. Author Ava Dellaira has adapted her own script from her novel about a teenage girl who starts writing letters to dead celebrities like Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse, Amelia Earhart, Judy Garland, Janis Joplin, and Heath Ledger. Temple Hill is a company that has made a lucrative business out of YA adaptations, with a filmography that includes The Fault in Our Stars and The Maze Runner franchise. Will Love Letters to the Dead be the film to break Catherine Hardwicke’s Rotten streak on the RT Tomatometer?1 AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR TWO-MOVIE ADAPTATION OF STEPHEN KING’S IT ON HOLDFor fans of Stephen King’s massive decades-spanning horror epic IT, the plans for a two-movie adaptation took a bit of a stumble this week. That’s because director Cary Fukunaga (2011’s Jane Eyre, HBO’s True Detective) has departed the IT adaptation, reportedly over budget issues and New Line Cinema’s interest in adapting IT as a single movie. Filming had been scheduled to start on the first IT movie this summer, with We’re the Millers star Will Poulter recently cast as Pennywise, the evil clown monster. Fukunaga’s departure has been described as putting the project on hold, but this story reports that IT may yet proceed with a new director, moving back to Warner Bros from subsidiary New Line Cinema. Some sources are also reporting that the cold feet about IT came from the perceived lackluster box office performance of the Poltergeist remake, which also heavily featured a scary clown in its marketing (that’s how Hollywood works sometimes, folks!).Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"FirstLook, discovery","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/chris-pine-wonder-woman.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-chris-pine-joins-dcs-wonder-woman"},{"id":"47509199631847","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Star Wars: Rogue One Will Be a Prequel","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Star Wars: Rogue One Will Be a PrequelPlus, Furious 8 is coming, Ewan McGregor joins Beauty and the Beast, and Tyler Perry joins TMNT 2.by RT Staff | April 24, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup recaps the last seven days from the world of film development, including news stories for titles like Bloodshot, Furious 8, Spider-Man (two different versions), and Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StorySTAR WARS ANTHOLOGY: ROGUE ONE REVEALED TO BE… A PREQUEL!?“Many Bothans died to bring us this information.” It turns out that by the end of 2016, we’re going to find out if Mon Mothma even knew what she was talking about. The reason for that is that on Sunday, at the Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, the world finally found out what that mysterious Rogue One movie is actually about. The teaser, which was online for a while, has since been pulled, but you can read most of what it revealed right here. The non-episode movies previously called “spinoffs” are now grouped together as parts of the Star Wars Anthology franchise, and all of that will start with Rogue One when it is released on December 16th, 2016. The official synopsis for Rogue One is brief, but exact: “A band of resistance fighters unite for a daring mission to steal the Death Star plans.” We also learned that DP Greig Fraser worked on Zero Dark Thirty, and VFX Supervisor Neil Corbud worked on Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down, and that these war movies should absolutely be interpreted as guideposts for the sort of film Rogue One is aiming to be. The weekend’s big reveal was also followed by stories that suggest that the already cast Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything) and Ben Mendelsohn (Animal Kingdom) might be joined by Riz Ahmed (Nightcrawler) and Sam Claflin (The Hunger Games). It’s not yet known if any of these actors will play Bothans.Fresh Developments This Week1. THIS WEEK IN SPIDER-MAN: ANIMATED MOVIE IN 2018, LIVE ACTION ACTOR SHORTLISTThis week, there were two big stories involving Spider-Man on the big screen, and although we already sort of knew about both movies, taken together, they’re still pretty big reveals. At the CinemaCon event in Las Vegas, Sony Pictures announced that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the team behind The LEGO Movie, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and 21 Jump Street, will be writing and producing the animated Spider-Man which Sony has scheduled for July 20, 2018. This animated Spider-Man will be set in its own separate continuity from Marvel Studios’ live-action movies and the live-action Spider-Man movie scheduled a year earlier on July 28, 2017. Basically, within three years, we’re going to have two different Spider-Man movie franchises (presuming Sony’s animated movie is likely to get its own sequels). As for the live-action teenage reboot with Marvel Studios, a new shortlist of young actors was revealed this week. The five actors Sony and Marvel are reportedly considering are: 18-year-olds Asa Butterfield (Hugo, Ender’s Game), Tom Holland (The Impossible), and Liam James (The Way Way Back), 19-year-old Timothee Chalamet (Finn from Showtime’s Homeland), and 20-year-old Nat Wolff (The Fault in Our Stars). Butterfield and Holland are British, Chalamet and Wolff are American, and Liam James is Canadian.2. VIN DIESEL HAS ANNOUNCED FURIOUS 8 FOR APRIL, 2017For the last few weeks as Furious 7 has raced across the world earning ridiculous box office numbers, Universal Pictures has played it coyly about plans for an eighth movie, even though it was pretty obvious it would happen. As it turns out, Universal was saving the news for this week’s CinemaCon, where Vin Diesel took the stage to announce that Furious 8 will be released on April 14, 2017. That’s about all we know right now, but it wasn’t the only big release date news from Universal this week. The videogame adaptation Warcraft (from Legendary Pictures and director Duncan Jones) has been shifted back from next March to June 10, 2016, and the sequel Pacific Rim 2 has also been moved back to August 8, 2017 (from April, 2017). Universal Pictures is also pushing back its plans for a new “cinematic universe” for its classic monster movies. Those plans will now start with a reboot of The Mummy on March 24, 2017 (instead of in June, 2016), which will be followed by an untitled monster movie on March 30, 2018 (instead of on April 21, 2017, making room for Furious 8).3. THE MCU, THE DCU, AND NOW THE VCU, WITH… BLOODSHOT AND HARBINGERAlthough Marvel and DC have been the “big two” for decades now, they are far from the only comic book companies with superhero titles (others include Image, Top Cow, Dynamite, and Dark Horse). Other companies have tried over the years to build their own “universes” of connected titles as well, although they sometimes don’t stick together (such as when creators leave the company, taking their heroes with them). One of the pubishers to have more consistent success with that concept is Valiant Comics, home to such titles as Archer &amp; Armstrong, Doctor Solar, Magnus: Robot Fighter, Ninjak, Turok, and X-O Manowar. Valiant Comics is now actively trying to get in on the “cinematic universe” business as well, with plans to start with movies based on Bloodshot and Harbinger. The new “VCU” line of movies is in partnership with Sony Pictures, and the first movie is expected to be Bloodshot, to be released in 2017. Bloodshot has already landed two of the year’s hottest directors in the form of the team of David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, whoe helmed last year’s surprise hit John Wick. Bloodshot tells the story of a war veteran whose abilities are enhanced by billions of nanites injected into his bloodstream. Other Valiant Comics properties also now in development include the X-Men-style team book Harbinger (from the producers of the Fast and Furious franchise), the comedy Archer &amp; Armstrong, and the thriller Shadowman.4. EMMA STONE AND STEVE CARELL TO ADAPT THE KING/RIGGS BATTLE OF THE SEXESBy now, you’re probably familiar with Hollywood’s tendency to produce “duelling movies” — competing producers and studios developing very similar projects at the same time (and sometimes even releasing the movies concurrently). Right now, we have two live action adaptations of The Jungle Book coming out within a year of each other, and two different movies about the Boston Marathon Bombing. We can now firmly add the 1973 “Battle of the Sexes” tennis challenge between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs to the mix, with this week’s news. Fox Searchlight Pictures has cast Emma Stone as Billie Jean King and Steve Carell as the much older Bobby Riggs, who makes proud proclamations about his ability to defeat any woman tennis player (despite clear evidence that she was a much, much better tennis player, even before their matches). The Carell/Stone project appears to have surprised the competition, which included Tom Hanks’ Playtone (as a HBO movie), and Will Ferrell’s Gary Sanchez, with Will Ferrell himself attached to play Bobby Riggs. Battle of the Sexes will be directed by the male/female directing team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the directors of both Ruby Sparks and Little Miss Sunshine.5. EWAN MCGREGOR CAST AS LUMIERE IN BEAUTY AND THE BEASTIt has seemed like every week lately has brought news from Walt Disney Pictures about new ensemble cast members for their 2017 live action remake of their 1991 animated musical Beauty and the Beast. This week brought two more announcements, and with them, we can definitely note a running theme. That theme appears to be representation of other studios’ major franchises. So far, we’ve had Emma Watson (as Belle) and Emma Thompson from Harry Potter, Luke Evans (as Gaston) from The Hobbit, and Sir Ian McKellen from both the Tolkien and X-Men franchises (as Cogsworth the talking clock). This week, we can add Star Wars and Transformers that list, as Ewan McGregor (from the Star Wars prequels) has signed on to play Lumiere the singing candelablra, and Stanley Tucci (from Transformers) has joined the cast as well. Tucci’s character is a bit of a departure because he will be playing a new character not seen in the 1991 movie, a singing grand piano called Cadenza. Disney has scheduled this remake of Beauty and the Beast for March 17, 2017.6. VINCE GILLIGAN’S BREAKING… BEANSTALK?As Walt Disney Pictures continues developing live-action remakes of their various animated feature films, it appears that such efforts are starting to go “deep” into their vault. For example, one of the studio’s lesser known classic movies is #9, Fun and Fancy Free, which packaged two short films together as an anthology: Bongo and Mickey and the Beanstalk, an adaptation of Jack and the Beanstalk. Without specifically mentioning Mickey and the Beanstalk, Walt Disney Pictures this week acquired a revisionist take on Jack and the Beanstalk called just Beanstalk. Not much is known about Beanstalk right now except that it comes from writer/producer Vince Gilligan, best known as the showrunner on the hit cable TV series Breaking Bad. Gilligan wrote a detailed outline for Beanstalk, and will now hand it off to one of his Breaking Bad producers, Thomas Schnauz, to write the full screenplay.7. ANDY SAMBERG AND KELSEY GRAMMER TO VOICE ANIMATED STORKSFollowing the success of last year’s The LEGO Movie, Warner Bros is expanding its animated feature film plans beyond just movies with LEGO branding. One such movie is called Storks, a pregnancy-themed comedy that promises to be “a fresh and funny look at the fable behind storks.” This week, we learned that both Andy Samberg and Kelsey Grammer have signed on to provide the voices of two of the lead characters. Storks will be codirected by Nicholas Stoller (Neighbors, Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and Doug Sweetland, creator of the Academy Award-nominated animated short film Presto. Warner Bros has scheduled Storks for release on September 23, 2016.8. RAPPER/ACTOR COMMON JOINS SUICIDE SQUAD, BUT AS WHOM?A few years back, Warner Bros nearly gave a greenlight to a DC Comics project called Justice League: Mortal, which would have been directed by George Miller (Mad Max: Fury Road). One of the characters in that version would have been Green Lantern John Stewart, and the person who would have played John Stewart was rapper/actor Common. That was before Warner Bros decided to cast Ryan Reynolds as long-running Green Lantern Hal Jordan. The reason this is worth bringing back up again is that Warner Bros has cast Common as one of the many, many, characters in next year’s Suicide Squad, and… they’re not saying who he’ll be playing. When Warner Bros announced their ambitious plans last year for future movies, Green Lantern was one of the announced characters, but not until 2020, and they didn’t specify which Green Lantern it would be. Did Warner Bros just stealth-announce one of their big movie stars and we just don’t realize it yet?Rotten Ideas of the Week1. TYLER PERRY CAST AS TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES 2 VILLAINWhile doing press last year for his supporting role in Gone Girl, Tyler Perry revealed that he didn’t actually know who famed director David Fincher was. This leads us to question what else he may not know whenever he takes a new job. For example, has he ever heard of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? We certainly hope so, because Tyler Perry has joined the cast of next year’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 (scheduled for 6/3/16). Perry will be playing the scientist Baxter Stockman, the creator of the Mouser machines, who in some versions of TMNT has also become a cyborg villain. Earlier reports had stated that the sequel would feature the anthropomorphic animal villains Bebop and Rocksteady, but they haven’t yet been cast or officially announced. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 will be directed by David Green, whose Earth to Echo last year earned a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 48%.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"It, TV, dc, asian-american, Trivia, The","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/star-wars.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-star-wars-rogue-one-will-be-a-prequel"},{"id":"47509199618531","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Reese Witherspoon Is Disney’s Live-Action Tinker Bell","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Reese Witherspoon Is Disney's Live-Action Tinker BellPlus, sequel news forStar Trek, The Croods, Now You See Me, and more.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 22, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers a week that is partly busy because of the Cannes Film Festival, but also partly slow because much of Hollywood has taken the whole week off leading up to Memorial Day. We did, however, have ten top film development news stories this week, covering such movies as The Croods 2, The Girl on the Train, Now You See Me 3, Project XX, and Star Trek Beyond, as well as new roles for Jack Black, Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryREESE WITHERSPOON TO STAR IN DISNEY’S LIVE-ACTION TINKFive years ago, back in 2010, before Disney’s multiple plans for live-action adaptations of their animated classics had really started to take off, we first heard of plans for a movie called Tink. At that point, Elizabeth Banks was attached to play the live-action version of Tinker Bell (from Peter Pan) in a movie about the story we don’t know (ala Maleficent). This week, we learned that Walt Disney Pictures is still very much interested in getting Tink produced, but that they now have a completely different lead actress. Reese Witherspoon is now attached to star in Tink, which is being written by Victoria Sprouse, the screenwriter of next year’s Pixar sequel Finding Dory (6/17/16). No reason is given for Elizabeth Banks’s departure from playing Tink, but it’s quite possible that Banks will simply be too busy. In addition to her acting career (which includes the future LEGO Movie sequels and spinoffs), Banks is also now a director (and may be returning for the inevitable Pitch Perfect 3). Walt Disney Pictures has not yet announced a release date for Tink, but there’s a very good chance it will be a major release later this decade.Fresh Developments This Week1 HIT NOVEL THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN GETS HELP FROM THE HELP (DIRECTOR)One of the biggest successes in publishing this year has been a novel called The Girl on the Train by author Paula Hawkins. The novel is attracting comparisons to both Gone Girl and the films of Alfred Hitchcock. So, it’s probably not surprising that someone in Hollywood noticed the book’s success, and has put the adaptation on the fast track. That studio is DreamWorks, and this week, we learned that director Tate Taylor will be reuniting with the studio behind his most successful film, The Help. Taylor also recently directed the James Brown biopic Get On Up, and is developing the business biopic Tupperware Unsealed. The Girl on the Train tells the story of a young woman who is fascinated by a house she sees every day on a commute train, until that compulsion makes her the only witness to something horrible that happens there.2 WILL FERRELL TO SAY, “GOOD NIGHT, YOU PRINCES OF SAN DIEGO, YOU KINGS OF TALLADEGA?”It’s sort of a cliche at this point that comic actors sometimes team up with directors better known for “Oscar bait.” And heck, Will Ferrell already did something several years ago, with the Kaufman-esque Stranger Than Fiction. This week, the director of which we speak is Sweden’s Lasse Hallström, whose filmography includes such films as Chocolat, The Cider House Rules, What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?, and most recently, last year’s The Hundred Foot Journey. Hallström and Ferrell are teaming up for Tom’s Dad, a comedy set in 1960s Nevada about a struggling nightclub performer who dreams of becoming a Las Vegas stage act, performing alongside various circus animals (sort of like a straight Siegfried without Roy, we guess?). Filming is expected to start sometime in early 2016, possibly aiming for a release date in late 2016 or sometime in 2017.3 KAT DENNINGS AND LESLIE MANN JOIN VOICE CAST OF THE CROODS 2Of DreamWorks Animation’s last ten non-sequels/spinoffs, only 2013’s The Croods earned over $500 million in worldwide box office, so obviously, one of their next four movie’s is going to be The Croods 2. It’s been presumed for a while that Nicolas Cage, Clarke Duke, Catherine Keener, Ryan Reynolds, and Emma Stone would be returning to reprise their character’s voices, but this week, we learned about two actresses who will be joining them for the sequel. Leslie Mann (AKA Mrs. Judd Apatow, and the frequent co-star of his films) will play the mother of a new family that the Croods encounter, and Kat Dennings (Thor, TV’s 2 Broke Girls) will play her daughter. Presumably, Mann and Dennings will be joined by male actors to play the rest of their family, but DreamWorks hasn’t announced those actors yet. The Croods 2 is scheduled for release on December 22, 2017.4 GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY WRITER/DIRECTOR JAMES GUNN’S NEXT: THE BELKO EXPERIMENTMarvel Studios has already announced a release date of May 5, 2017 for Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and so, we can expect that sometime soon, writer/director James Gunn will be fully at work on that sequel. In the meantime, however, Gunn has another non-Marvel movie that he has written that starts filming soon, and this week, there were several stories about the film’s cast. The ensemble cast will include Tony Goldwyn (TV’s Scandal), John C. McGinley (TV’s Scrubs), Melonie Diaz (Fruitvale Station), and John Gallagher Jr. (HBO’s The Newsroom), with more cast probably yet to be announced. The movie in question is called The Belko Experiment, a thriller for MGM, and it’s about the employees in a corporate building (The Belko Corporation) who are forced to start killing each other. It’s not expected that the Belko Corporation employs any talking raccoons. The Belko Experiment will start filming in Bogota, Colombia, in June, 2015, under the direction of Greg McLean (Wolf Creek, Rogue, Wolf Creek 2).Rotten Ideas of the Week5 STAR TREK‘S SIMON PEGG USES THE WORD “INFANTILIZE”, THE NERDSPHERE SUFFERS A MELTDOWNThere’s no way of telling what sort of long-term impact this story will have (just a hunch: very little), but this week, beloved geek/nerd icon Simon Pegg was quoted as dropping a truth bomb, and the world’s blogosphere suffered a mild implosion as a result. It all started when Pegg was quoted as saying, “Nerd culture is the product of a late capitalist conspiracy, designed to infantalize the consumer as a means of non-aggressive control.” At the same time, Pegg also mentioned that he had to get back to work on writing Star Trek Beyond, and in a normal week, the revelation of the title of the third Star Trek movie would have been the news. Instead, people reacted with shock that anyone would describe a generation who has spent 30+ years playing with movie tie-in toys and reading comic books as being “infantilize(d).” A day later, in response to the online reactions, Pegg went into more detail about the next Star Trek, and probably dug the hole even deeper, saying that he was hired to work on the script because, “I think the studio was worried that it might have been a little bit too Star Trek-y.” Comparing the box office of Star Trek Into Darkness to the box office of Marvel’s The Avengers (which made over a billion dollars more), Simon Pegg said of Star Trek, “People don?t see it being a fun, brightly coloured, Saturday night entertainment like the Avengers,” so that the studio’s solution will be to, “make a western or a thriller or a heist movie, then populate that with Star Trek characters so it’s more inclusive to an audience that might be a little bit reticent.” Justin Lin, the four time director of the Fast and Furious franchise (movies #3, #4, #5, and #6, specifically), will be directing Star Trek Beyond, which Paramount Pictures has scheduled for July 8, 2016.4 A YEAR BEFORE THE SECOND MOVIE, LIONSGATE ALREADY WORKING ON NOW YOU SEE ME 3Much like what happened a few years ago at Warner Bros when the Harry Potter franchise came to an end, Lionsgate is currently trying to figure out how to keep up their annual box office in the time after The Hunger Games comes to an end later this year. This week, we learned more about two of what Lionsgate sees as new franchises for the studio. First of all, there was the news this week that Lionsgate is already developing Now You See Me 3, the second sequel to their 2013 magicians-turned-thieves surprise hit (50% on the Tomatometer). This news comes over a year before the June 10, 2016 release of the first sequel, next year’s Now You See Me: The Second Act. Another potential new franchise for Lionsgate is a series of classical Greek adaptations, starting with a two-movie adaptation of Homer’s The Odyssey, which will be directed by Francis Lawrence, who will continue to work for Lionsgate after the last three Hunger Games movies. Francis Lawrence’s filmography also includes Constantine, I Am Legend, and Water for Elephants.3 IMPRESSIVE WRITERS ROOM ASSEMBLED FOR THE TRANSFORMERS FRANCHISEA pall that continues to hang over the $3.76 billion worldwide box office of the four movies in the Transformers film franchise is the impression among many that the movies just aren’t particularly great. Although the first movie in 2007 almost earned a Fresh rating (57% is three points shy of the margin), movie #3 was Rotten with 35%, and movies #2 and #4 received the lowest scores, with 19% and 18%, respectively. This appears to be an issue that Paramount Pictures and their assembled “Transformers brain trust” appears to be taking seriously, as with screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, they have assembled an impressive “writers room” for the franchise, going forward. The idea is to form four creative teams which will then take on assigned parts of the movies forming an expanding Transformers Cinematic Universe. This group includes comic book writer Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead, Marvel Zombies), screenwriting partners Art Marcum and Matt Holloday (Iron Man, Punisher: War Zone), prolific Fox/Marvel movie screenwriter Zak Penn, and Jeff Pinkner (The Amazing Spider-Man 2). It’s not yet known which directors might eventually be recruited to work on any of these Transformers movies, or what they might be about. There are still a lot of question marks, so unfortunately, this story is still at least a borderline “Rotten Idea” this week.2 JACK BLACK REUNITING WITH NACHO LIBRE DIRECTOR FOR MICRONATIONSNine years after the 2006 release of Nacho Libre (Rotten at 40%), Jack Black is now attached to reunite with that film’s director, Jared Hess, for a comedy called Micronations. As the title suggests, Micronations will be a comedic take on the concept of small groups of people who declare themselves to be sovereign states. Specifically, Jack Black will play the head of defense for the nation of Valoria (population 12), that finds itself at war with neighboring micronation Wayne County, Nevada. Although Jared Hess had a promising debut in 2004 with Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre was the first of a streak of three movies which have all received Rotten Tomatometer scores (40% for Nacho Libre, 19% for Gentlemen Broncos, and 40% for this year’s Don Verdean).1 THE PARTY LINGERS ON WITH THE SEQUEL PROJECT XXIn March of 2012, shortly after the “crazy party” comedy Project X opened to a weekend of $21 million (from a budget of $12 million), Warner Bros announced plans for a sequel. And that seemed to pretty much be the end of such plans for the three years since. That is, until this week, as Warner Bros has announced a release date of August 19, 2016 for the sequel called Project XX. It is as yet unknown if any of the first film’s cast will be returning for the sequel. The first Project X received a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 28%.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Competition, true, Skip, Films","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/reese-witherspoon-ketchup.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-reese-witherspoon-is-disneys-liveaction-tinker-bell"},{"id":"47509199662574","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Steven Spielberg to Direct Jennifer Lawrence in New Film","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Steven Spielberg to Direct Jennifer Lawrence in New FilmPlus, an Adventure Time movie, new roles for Leonardo DiCaprio and Ethan Hawke, and Hugh Jackman wants to be Wolverine forever.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 6, 2015 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup includes movie development news stories for such titles as Adventure Time, Beauty and the Beast, The Magnificent Seven, and The Spectacular Spider-Man, and new roles for Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryJENNIFER LAWRENCE TO STAR IN STEVEN SPIELBERG’S IT’S WHAT I DOAs sometimes happens when the director is in between film projects, we’ve been hearing a lot lately about Steven Spielberg’s potential new films, and his name came up again this week. The revelation came out when Warner Bros won a steeply competitive auction for the rights to photographer Lynsey Addario’s memoir It’s What I Do: A Photographer’s Life of Love and War. It was only after Warner Bros won the rights that we learned what their secret weapons were in the deal. Namely, Warner Bros had already begun talks with both Jennifer Lawrence to star, and Steven Spielberg to direct, their adaptation of It’s What I Do. And now, let’s talk about why Addario’s memoir was so sought after. Lynsey Addario, even before 2001, had developed a career as a photographer in Afghanistan, including documenting people on both sides of the Taliban’s regime. So, when September 11th happened, and the United States invaded Afghanistan, Addario was uniquely positioned in what was soon to become a defining event in the early years of our century. Steven Spielberg is already working on at least two other films that will come before It’s What I Do: the recently titled Cold War drama Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks (10/16/15), and the fantasy adaptation The BFG (7/1/16). We also learned this week that Steven Spielberg will be continuing his producer relationship with director Colin Treverrow (Jurassic World), as DreamWorks has picked up his alien romance project Intelligent Life.Fresh Developments This Week1 WILL SPIDER-MAN EMERGE FROM THE CABIN IN THE WOODS?First off, we should acknowledge that this story concerns a deal which hasn’t been finalized, but it’s still a pretty big deal at any stage of the negotiations. Following the renewed future of Spider-Man on the big screen, Marvel Studios and Sony are working quickly to find a director for the rebooted film (scheduled for 7/28/17), tentatively titled The Spectacular Spider-Man. Director Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods) had already been working at Sony on a spinoff movie for Spider-Man’s villains called The Sinister Six, and so it appears, that gave him an inside edge at being their first choice to instead direct Spider-Man’s second reboot within 10 years. This story was first reported by Latino Review, here. Perhaps not coincidentally, Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and next year’s Captain America: Civil War signed a three year “first look” deal with Sony Pictures. Sony’s press release about the deal glowingly praised the Russo Brothers’ “ability to bring excitement, audacity and phenomenal commercial success to a variety of genres and endeavors.” What they might bring to Sony hasn’t been revealed yet, but hey, Joe and Anthony Russo did executive produce Community… (#sixseasonsandamovie).2 X-MEN DIRECTOR BRYAN SINGER BOOKS A TRIP TO HEINLEIN’S THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESSIt’s possible that various popular YA franchises have taken their place, but there was a time when nearly every sci-fi-obsessed middle schooler of a certain age and disposition seemed required to read the books of Robert A. Heinlein. For reasons that are not immediately obvious, Heinlein’s stories seem to be somewhat underpresented in film, although we did get Starship Troopers, and Ethan Hawke’s recent film Predestination was based upon a Heinlein story. One could hypothesize that Heinlein adaptations were held back for decades by budgetary issues, during the years when it was more difficult for such movies to get produced with the words “Star” “Trek” or “Wars” in the title. A sign that the times might be shifting in Heinlein’s favor happened this week, as Bryan Singer, who has guided Fox’s X-Men franchise to success, has signed on to direct one of Heinlein’s most famous titles. Bryan Singer and 20th Century Fox are working together on an adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein’s The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. Although that is such a cool title, Fox’s adaptation will instead be titled Uprising, since basically, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is indeed about a rebellion by a lunar penal colony against Earth. Uprising is not the first attempt at an adaptation of The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, as the rights have previously been set up at both DreamWorks and with Harry Potter producer David Heyman, before eventually reverting back to Heinlein’s estate after the alotted development time had passed. Of course, if 20th Century Fox is going to get Uprising going in time, they’re going to have let Bryan Singer stop directing X-Men movies for a while. Singer’s next, X-Men: Apocalypse, starts filming next month in Canada, and is scheduled for release on May 27, 2016.3 DOWNTON ABBEY STAR DAN STEVENS JOINS DISNEY’S BEAUTY AND THE BEASTNow that Walt Disney Pictures has firmed up Emma Watson as the “Beauty” in their live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, this week, the studio made two big announcements about Belle’s two would-be romantic leads. Luke Evans, whose filmography includes playing Bard the Bowman in the recent Hobbit movies, a villain in Furious 6, and the titular character in last year’s Dracula Untold, has been cast as the hunter Gaston, Belle’s human romantic interest. Not long after that announcement, we also learned that Dan Stevens (Downton Abbey) had been cast as the cursed prince who becomes the film’s “Beast.” Bill Condon (Dreamgirls, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn) will direct Beauty and the Beast for Disney starting later this year.4 INSPIRED BY BIRDMAN, HUGH JACKMAN WANTS TO PLAY WOLVERINE UNTIL HE DIESMost of the stories covered by the Weekly Ketchup deal with movie and casting announcements. This one, however, isn’t directly about one specific movie, but it might address such questions for decades to come. That’s because Hugh Jackman recently said that, inspired by Michael Keaton’s performance in Birdman, he wants to keep playing Wolverine until he dies. Specifically, Jackman was quoted as saying, “I said to my wife, ‘The moral is that I should never stop playing Wolverine. I’ve got to find a way to keep playing him until I die.’ I know that someday they’ll recast the role with another actor… I’d be happy if the role was eventually recast. It would mean that it had become iconic.” Jackman’s next solo film as Wolverine is scheduled to start filming in 2016 for release on March 3, 2017.5 LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO STAR IN MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DRAMA THE CROWDED ROOMLeonardo DiCaprio has played people struggling with problems of the mind in the past (What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?, The Aviator, and Shutter Island), and this week, he signed on to another such film project. And it’s one that he’s actually been considering since the 1990s. Leonardo DiCaprio is nearing a deal with New Regency to produce and star in an adaptation of the 1981 non-fiction book The Crowded Room. If the deal goes through, DiCaprio will play a man named Billy Milligan who was charged in the 1970s for crimes in Ohio that included burglary and rape. Milligan’s legal defense was that two of his 24 multiple personality disorder identities actually committed the crimes. You can read more about Milligan’s history on Wikipedia, but it’s likely filled with spoilers for the eventual movie. DiCaprio also made a multi-film deal with Netflix this week for exclusive streaming rights to his upcoming documentaries dealing with “topical and provocative environmental and conservation themes.”6 ADVENTURE TIME TO GET A MOVIE, A LA THE LEGO MOVIEThe success last year of The LEGO Movie continues to have ramifications, not just for related projects like LEGO Ninjago, The LEGO Batman Movie, and The LEGO Movie Sequel, but for a film with no obvious direct connection. That project is the feature film adaptation of the Cartoon Network animated series Adventure Time. Warner Bros is now developing an animated feature based on Adventure Time which will be produced by Chris McKay, one of the producers of The LEGO Movie, who was also recently hired to direct The LEGO Batman Movie. It’s expected that the Adventure Time movie will take advantage of some of the voice talents who have already worked on the TV show, such as Neil Patrick Harris, Mark Hamill, Paul Reubens, Andy Samberg, and George Takei.7 TRAINING DAY STARS TO REUNITE FOR THE MAGNIFICENT SEVENAs implied by the title, Antonine Fuqua’s remake of The Magnificent Seven is going to have several stars. Denzel Washington has been attached to the remake for a few years now, and Chris Pratt also signed on recently. This week, we learned the third member of the titular septet will represent a Training Day reunion, as it’s Ethan Hawke. Hawke’s career is obviously on a continued upswing, following success with Sinister in 2012, The Purge in 2013, and Boyhood in 2014. Haley Bennett, who costarred with Denzel Washington in The Equalizer, has also signed on for a supporting role. It’s expected that MGM will schedule The Magnificent Seven sometime in 2016. The original Seven Samurai was produced in 1954, and the remake (which turned the samurai story into a gunslinging western) The Magnficent Seven was released in 1960.8 EMILE HIRSCH AND BRIAN COX JOIN TROLLHUNTER DIRECTOR’S ENGLISH LANGUAGE DEBUTEmile Hirsch is having legal problems these days. Even so, the star of Speed Racer and Into the Wild is still landing work. Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox have both signed to be the leads in The Autopsy of Jane Doe, a coroner drama that will be the English language debut of Norwegian director Andre Øvredal, who first made his mark internationally with the giant monster horror comedy Trollhunter a few years ago. Hirsch and Cox will play a father/son team of coroners who are challenged to figure out the mystery surrounding a woman’s body with no discernable cause of death. Another mystery challenging The Autopsy of Jane Doe is Emile Hirsch’s court date in Utah on March 16, as filming is scheduled to start on The Autopsy of Jane Doe in late March.9 OCTAVIA SPENCER TO PLAY GOD IN THE SHACKIf Morgan Freeman’s career can serve as a blueprint for other African-American actors, two occupations that have seemed to worked out well for him are the POTUS (Deep Impact, and briefly in Olympus Has Fallen) and well, God (Bruce Almighty and its sequel Evan Almighty). We’re still waiting on the movie where she plays the President, but this week, Academy Award winner (and awkward Oscar sequence participant) Octavia Spencer crossed one of those off of her “bucket list.” Spencer is in final negotiations with Lionsgate to star as God in their adaptation of the bestselling 2007 novel The Shack by William P. Young. The Shack will be directed by Stuart Hazeldine (2008’s Exam) from a script by John Fusco, whose filmography includes Thunderheart, The Forbidden Kingdom, and Spirit: Stallion of the Kingdom. Fusco has also recently worked on the latest remake of Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai, and the young Elvis biopic Last Train to Memphis. The Shack tells the story of a father who is invited to return to the scene of his daughter’s abduction by a note from a woman claiming to be God.Rotten Ideas of the WeekThis week for Lent, this writer is giving up calling movie development stories Rotten Ideas.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Tour, Netflix","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jennifer-lawrence-spielberg.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-steven-spielberg-to-direct-jennifer-lawrence-in-new-film"},{"id":"47509201193459","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Chris Pratt Wanted for Indiana Jones Reboot","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Chris Pratt Wanted for Indiana Jones RebootPlus, the all-female Ghostbusters are cast, and new roles for Matthew McConaughey, Emma Watson, and Brad Pitt.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 30, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup comes to you from right in the middle of the Sundance Film Festival, but except for the news about the 25+ indie movies picked up for distribution there, you wouldn’t otherwise be able to tell. This was a week with lots of big studio announcements, regarding who will star in the Ghostbusters reboot, who the new Indiana Jones might be, or what new roles people like Matthew McConaughey, Brad Pitt, Adam Sandler, or Emma Watson are lining up.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryDISNEY WANTS CHRIS PRATT AS THE NEW INDIANA JONESFive years ago, Walt Disney Pictures was still one of Hollywood’s biggest and most successful studios, but in 2009 and 2012, they made two corporate decisions that took them to a whole new level. Through their 2009 acquisition of Marvel, Disney ignited the spaceship engines that led to last year’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm gave them Star Wars to boot. Sort of forgotten in all of that is that Lucasfilm also owned the rights to the Indiana Jones franchise, which back in the 1980s was one of the most popular film franchises in the world. Paramount had attempted to revive the franchise in 2008, but seven years later, people mostly just remember this from that movie. This week, we learned that someone at Disney apparently had a “lightbulb-overhead” moment while looking at the opening scenes of Star-Lord plundering an ancient city for a valuable relic. Walt Disney Pictures has “set its sights” on casting Chris Pratt as the new Indiana Jones in a new franchise of movies about the 1930s archaelogist-adventurer famous for his whip, wise cracking humor, and hatred of snakes. Of course, it’s a long way from an idea to an actual movie, and Chris Pratt already has a growing slate. In addition to this summer’s Jurassic World, Pratt also starts filming the remake-of-a-remake of The Magnificient Seven (with Denzel Washington). He’s also attached to star in Universal’s Cowboy Ninja Viking for the directors of John Wick, and of course, there’s also Guardians of the Galaxy 2, which Marvel has scheduled for May 5, 2017.Fresh Developments This Week#1 THE ALL-FEMALE GHOSTBUSTERS: MCCARTHY, WIIG, AND TWO FROM SNLIt’s all happened so fast, so it can be easy to forget that only a year ago (before the death of Harold Ramis), we were still talking about the long-in-development sequel Ghostbusters 3. Once we learned that Paul Feig was developing a total reboot with a quartet of female stars, several names were bandied about, with the cast of Bridesmaids (which Feig directed) frequently being mentioned. This week, we finally found out who the four stars will be, and they are evenly divided between Bridesmaids and Saturday Night Live cast members. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig were both in Bridesmaids, and Wiig is a former cast member on SNL, the show where her future costars Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon are currently honing their comedic skills. Negotiations with all four are still underway, but if the deals work out, they will start filming the new Ghostbusters, which Sony Pictures has scheduled for July 22, 2016, in New York City (of course).&nbsp;#2 MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY? BABY, HE WAS BORN TO RUNIn the year since the release of Dallas Buyers Club, its tour through last year’s awards season, and the airing of the first season of HBO’s True Detective, Matthew McConaughey’s “people” have been prudently at work on making the most of his raised profile. This has included the Japanese drama The Sea of Trees, the jungle adventure Gold, the Civil War true story The Free State of Jones, and voice roles for both Illumination Entertainment and LAIKA on Kubo and the Two Strings. Oh, and on top of all of that, Matthew McConaughey is also frequently rumored to be Warner Bros’ choice to play Randall Flagg in their adaptations of Stephen King’s The Stand. Now, we can add another true story based on the Christopher McDougall non-fiction book, Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Super Athletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Ever Seen. The book spent over three years on the New York Times Bestseller list, and has sold over 3 million copies. McConaughey will play an American journalist who travels to Mexico’s Copper Canyon to learn how the indigenous Tarahumara people are able to run barefoot across the desert at great speeds without any injury. The popularity of the book has led to a resurgence in the popularity of barefoot running, which is now reportedly a $2-billion-a-year industry. Born to Run will need some time to develop (it currently doesn’t have a director, for example), as the script is worked on by Matthew Michael Carnahan, whose credits include State of Play, World War Z, and the upcoming Deepwater Horizon project, which Peter Berg (Battleship, Lone Survivor) is now in talks to direct.&nbsp;#3 BATKID BEGINS TO GET HIS OWN MOVIE, COURTESY OF JULIA ROBERTSIn the week before Thanksgiving, 2013, it was probably impossible to have much contact with social media without being aware of one of the most elaborate examples ever of flash mobbing, crowd funding, and the Make-a-Wish Foundation. On November 15, 2013, a large section of the city of San Francisco was transformed into “Gotham City” to grant 5 year old cancer patient Miles Scott his wish of becoming “Batkid” for one day. A little over a year later, Scott’s story has inspired a documentary feature called Batkid Begins: The Wish Heard Around the World, which screened in competition at this year’s Slamdance Film Festival. And the story doesn’t end there, because Julia Roberts and her Red Om Films production company have now stepped in to adapt Batkid Begins as a feature film. Roberts will also star in the movie, although it’s unclear what her role will be. Batkid Begins is currently an independent production, but one would imagine that there will be a strong motivation for Warner Bros to participate in some form, since it will be a very different story without their characters like Batman, Penguin, and the Riddler.&nbsp;#4 EMMA WATSON JOINS DISNEY’S LIVE ACTION REMAKE OF BEAUTY AND THE BEASTAt the same time that Walt Disney Pictures is developing all of their various live action remakes of their classic animated movies, there are also frequently other studios and filmmakers who are developing similar projects elsewhere, in competition with Disney. (Disney’s The Jungle Book on 4/15/16 will be followed, for example, by Warner Bros’ Jungle Book: Origins on 10/6/17.) Other times, the competition drops out as Disney gets closer to production, and that’s what happened last summer with Guillermo Del Toro’s plans for a live action Beauty and the Beast, even after he cast Harry Potter star Emma Watson to play the “Beauty.” Seven months later, we can now report that Watson has indeed been cast by Walt Disney Pictures as Belle, AKA the “Beauty” in Beauty and the Beast. To be clear, this project has nothing to do with Guillermo Del Toro, as Disney’s version will instead be directed by Bill Condon (Chicago, Dreamgirls, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Parts 1 and 2). As Emma Watson herself soon clarified, unlike most of the other recent Disney live action movies, this Beauty and the Beast will also be a musical, including such songs as “Be Our Guest” and “Something There.” This project will also be a reunion of sorts for Emma Watson, who starred in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, which was written and directed by Stephen Chbosky, who is also writing this new live action adaptation. Production is expected to start in late 2015, possibly for a release date in 2017.&nbsp;#5 BRAD PITT TO JOIN (DIRECTOR) ANGELINA JOLIE IN AFRICAEver since Angelina Jolie first started focusing more on her career as a director than (necessarily) her career as an actress, it was probably inevitable that she would cast a certain A list movie star, and that happened with her third film as director, By the Sea. Brad Pitt is now in talks to star in her fourth film as well, playing Kenyan paleo-archaeologist Richard Leakey in a film called Africa. The film, as written by screenwriter Eric Roth (Munich, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) will depict Leakey’s struggles to protect Africa’s elephant population from ivory poachers. With a script, director, and star all lined up, Africa may be fast tracked to start filming in Kenya as early as this summer.&nbsp;#6 SUNDANCE 2015: DOZENS OF INDIE MOVIES PICKED UP FOR DISTRIBUTIONEver since the 1990s, each January has lured Hollywood insiders from both indie distributors and studio subsidiaries in the hope of acquiring the next Reservoir Dogs, Clerks, Napoleon Dynamite, The Blair Witch Project, Saw, or (500) Days of Summer. Some years seem to be sort of slow for acquisition news, but this was not one of those years, with a current total of 28 films that have been acquired for distribution (and that number will continue to grow well into February, because it always does). The current stand out (at least on paper) is probably the teen drama Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, which Fox Searchlight acquired for a record $12 million, probably hoping to replicate their parent studio’s success last year with The Fault in Our Stars. Other titles out of Sundance to watch out for in the next year or so will be: 10,000 Saints, Best of Enemies, The Bronze, Brooklyn, City of Gold, Cop Car, The D Train, The Diary of a Teenage Girl, Digging for Fire, Don Verdean, Dope, Dreamcatcher, The End of the Tour, Grandma, In Football We Trust, Knock Knock, Misery Loves Comedy, Mississippi Grind, Mistress America, The Overnight, Songs My Brothers Taught Me, Results, Reversal, Strangerland, Tangerine, The Witch, and The Wolfpack. Like we said, this was a very, very busy year at Sundance.Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 WE MAY NOT HAVE FLYING CARS YET, BUT THE JETSONS GET ANOTHER ANIMATED MOVIEHollywood history is littered with film projects that kick around in movie development for decades without ever getting made. The impetus for these projects often comes from one or two successes that inspire development executives to start picking up similar ideas to make lightning strike twice. One such hit was 1994’s The Flintstones, which led Universal Pictures to start work on other live-action adaptations of old Hanna-Barbera cartoon TV shows. One such project was the future-set family sitcom The Jetsons, which was possibly hindered at the time by the box office flop experienced by Jetsons: The Movie in 1990, which was instead an animated adaptation (some 20+ years after the show was popular). A few years ago, the rights to the Hanna-Barbera shows landed at Warner Bros, and for a while, the studio was still developing it as live action (with Kanye West somehow involved). This week, the news broke that Warner Bros is now developing The Jetsons as another animated movie, and the first step was to hire unproduced screenwriter Matt Lieberman, who is also working on a new Scooby-Doo movie for Warner Bros. Although he has yet to get a movie produced, Matt Lieberman has landed lots of jobs in Hollywood, including working on a remake of Short Circuit, a Paramount Animation project called Giant Monsters Attack Japan, and a “found footage Santa Claus” movie called 12/24.&nbsp;#2 TIME TO SWITCH FROM ANDROID: INDEPENDENCE DAY RETURNS NEXT SUMMEROne can hypothesize that there could be loose rules for various types of movie projects (remakes, reboots, cinematic universes, etc). For sequels, it often seems like there should be a “sell by date,” just like you find on lunch meat and milk jugs. How long that time should be is debatable, and probably varies from film to film, but anything above 15 years is probably pushing it. Take, for example, the 1996 alien invasion movie Independence Day, which was not only the #1 box office movie of that year (with $817 million worldwide), but at the time, it was the #2 movie of all time, after Jurassic Park. Talk about a sequel started almost immediately, and for many years, the sequel called ID Forever seemed like it was perpetually a year or two away from happening. Well, we’re now looking at the 20th anniversary happening next summer, and the same is still basically the same for the sequel. For a while, there was talk of two sequels being filmed back-to-back, but now Fox has trimmed the plans down to just one, which is scheduled for June 24, 2016. 20th Century Fox has reportedly extended an offer to Liam Hemsworth, costar of The Hunger Games (and brother to Thor), for him to be the star of ID Forever. Two years ago, there had been a story about Michael B. Jordan (of the Fantastic Four reboot) also being in the running for a role (probably as the son of Will Smith’s character, who won’t be returning for the sequel), but he wasn’t mentioned in this week’s story. ID Forever will be directed by Roland Emmerich, who also directed the first movie, and whose last five films as directors have all received Rotten Tomatometer scores.&nbsp;#1 ADAM SANDLER’S FIRST NETFLIX COMEDY RIDICULOUS 6 GETS HUGE CASTLast year, when Netflix announced a multi-film deal with Adam Sandler, pundits and fans alike were divided about how they felt about the news, frequently in the same paragraph. On the one hand, it suggested a trend towards comedies abandoning theatrical releases (bad), but what if you don’t like Adam Sandler movies (good)? And then the rollercoaster story of The Interview happened, and the film (although likely a fluke that can never be repeated) earned possibly as much through streaming as it might have in its originally planned theatrical release (currently at $40 million and growing). This week, we learned who Netflix and Adam Sandler’s Happy Madison has been able to recruit into costarring in their first collaboration, a Western ensemble comedy called Ridiculous 6 (spoofing The Magnificent Seven). The title sextet will be a group of half- brothers made up of Adam Sandler (whose character was raised by a Native American tribe), Taylor Lautner (who costarred in Grown Ups 2), Brooklyn Nine-Nine costar Terry Crews, Luke Wilson, frequent Sandler costar Rob Schneider, and a sixth actor not yet announced. Nick Nolte will play Sandler’s father, Will Forte and Danny Trejo will play rival gang leaders, country singer Blake Shelton will play Wyatt Earp, and Vanilla Ice will play author Mark Twain (yes, really). Other roles will go to Dan Aykroyd, Steve Buscemi, Whitney Cummings, Jon Lovitz, Nick Swardson, Steve Zahn, and Lavell Crawford (Huell from Breaking Bad). Ridiculous 6 had previously been in development at both Paramount and Sony, but when Adam Sandler made his deal with Netflix, it was one of the Happy Madison projects that went along with him. Frequent Sandler director Frank Coraci (Blended, Click, The Waterboy) will direct from a script cowritten by Adam Sandler and another frequent collaborator, Tim Herlihy, when filming starts on Ridiculous 6 in a few weeks.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"TCM, worst, TLC, Awards, Broadway, kids, The, TV, saw, streaming, dceu","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-chris-pratt-wanted-for-indiana-jones-reboot"},{"id":"47509201197558","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Justin Lin Takes Over Star Trek 3","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Justin Lin Takes Over Star Trek 3Plus, a final Rambo sequel and new roles for Melissa McCarthy, Matthew McConaughey, Paul Rudd, and Liam Neeson.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 9, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup returns to its regular schedule, after the previous two columns looked back at the Fresh Developments and Rotten Ideas of 2014. As such, this time, we’re actually looking at movie development news stories from not just this week, but also some that date all the way back to before Christmas (but mostly it was this week, because Hollywood takes really, really, long holiday vacations). Included in the mix are Gambit, Ghostbusters, Rambo: Last Blood, and Wicked.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StorySTAR TREK 3 TO BE FAST AND FURIOUS NEXT SUMMERAs often happens in the first days of a new year, a few studios announced release dates this week and last, mostly for the year 2016, although there were a few release dates in 2017, as well. One of these films was the science fiction sequel we’re still calling Star Trek 3 (until its eventual real title is announced), which is now scheduled for July 18, 2016. The Star Trek 3 news came along with an even bigger reveal, which is that the director taking over for J.J. Abrams will be Justin Lin, who is best known for directing four of the Fast and Furious movies (specifically, movies #3, #4, #5, and #6). Traditionally, there aren’t many vehicles with four wheels in the Star Trek franchise, although the young Kirk did trash a muscle car early in the 2009 reboot. Also in the summer of 2016, Matt Damon’s fourth Bourne movie has been moved to July 29, 2016, and The Purge 3 has been scheduled for July 1, 2016. 20th Century Fox also recently announced several release dates, including Assassin’s Creed (12/21/16), The Greatest Showman on Earth (with Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum) (12/25/16), The Fantastic Four 2 (6/2/17), and the third film in the Planet of the Apes reboot franchise (7/14/17). The film in Fox’s announcement that is arguably the biggest news is the Gambit solo film, starring Channing Tatum (10/7/16). There are multiple reasons for this, but one that is frequently overlooked is that this means that in 2016, 20th Century Fox will become the first studio to ever release three films in the same franchise in the same calendar year: Deadpool (2/12/16)*, X-Men: Apocalypse (5/27/16), and Gambit (10/7/16), with a fourth X-Men franchise film coming within the same 13 month period with The Wolverine 2 (3/3/17). (* Deadpool also made the news with word that T.J. Miller and Ed Skrein are in talks for supporting roles).Fresh Developments This Week#1 SHRINKING MOVIE DOWNSIZING CAST GROWSIn the same week as the premiere of the first trailer for the shrinking superhero movie Ant-Man, another movie about shrinking humans made the news twice. We’re talking about Downsizing, the long-in-development social satire about a couple who decides life is too expensive to be lived at full size, which will be the next film from director Alexander Payne (Sideways, The Descendants, Nebraska). Matt Damon had already been cast last year, and this week, the actress who had previously been mentioned as a possibility to play his wife indeed signed on to play his wife. That would be Reese Witherspoon, who previously worked with Alexander Payne on Election. The Reese Witherspoon new was soon followed by three actors in supporting roles: Alec Baldwin, Neil Patrick Harris, and Jason Sudeikis.&nbsp;#2 ELLE FANNING TO STAR IN NICOLAS WINDING REFN’S THE NEON DEMONAlthough his RT Tomatometer stumbled a bit with Only God Forgives, director Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, Bronson, the Pusher trilogy) has been something of a critical darling, and he’s also attracted a cultish following of fans. After two films starring Ryan Gosling, Refn’s next lead will be 16-year-old Elle Fanning (Super 8, Maleficent), who has signed to star in the horror film The Neon Demon. Details are sparse, except that Elle Fanning will play an “aspiring model caught in a world of beauty and demise” (and presumably, at least one brightly colored demon).#3 WILL WICKED WITCH WIND UP IN THEATERS IN 2016?Universal Pictures’ adaptation of the hit musical Wicked has been in development for several years now, but this week, while promoting another fantasy musical (Into the Woods), producer Marc Platt hinted that we might now be within two years of its release. Specifically, Platt said that the target for release is 2016 (one could guess December, as that’s when musicals are often released, though Platt didn’t specify). It was from the same article that we also found out that the director attached to Wicked is Stephen Daldry, whose credits include The Hours, The Reader, and the dance drama Billy Elliot. Wicked is of course a musical based upon a novel that acts as a prequel to L. Frank Baum?s Oz books, telling the story of how a young woman named Elphaba became the Wicked Witch of the West.&nbsp;#4 MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY JOINS FREE STATE OF JONES, KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGSThe current upswing of Matthew McConaughey’s career is no fugazi, fugayzi, woozy, or wazzy. The actor is hot, especially after recent roles in The Wolf of Wall Street, Dallas Buyers Club, and Interstellar. This week, McConaughey was confirmed to be starring in the Civil War romantic drama Free State of Jones as Southern Unionist (soldiers who rebelled against the Confederacy) Newton Knight. Gugu Mbatha-Raw will costar as a slave with whom Newton Knight had a romantic relationship, inspiring him to lead the movement against the Confederacy, starting with a group of deserting soldiers. Free State of Jones will be writer/director Gary Ross’s fourth film as director after Pleasantville, Seabiscuit, and The Hunger Games. Free State of Jones will be a $65 million independent production filming in New Orleands and elsewhere in Louisiana. Matthew McConaughey will also be providing his voice, along with Rooney Mara and Charlize Theron, to the next stop-motion animated film from Laika, the company behind such films as Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls. Titled Kubo and the Two Strings, the film “kindhearted Kubo, who lives a humble life devotedly caring for his mother in their sleepy shoreside village. But when a spirit from the past catches up with him to enforce an age-old vendetta, Kubo suddenly finds himself on the run from gods and monsters.” Focus Features has scheduled Kubo and the Two Strings for August 19, 2016.&nbsp;#5 MELISSA MCCARTHY IN TALKS TO STAR IN GHOSTBUSTERS REBOOTEver since we learned last year that Sony Pictures was planning on a female reboot of Ghostbusters to be written and directed by Paul Feig, the idea that Feig would heavily recruit from the cast of Bridesmaids has been presumed. That notion came closer to happening with today’s news that Melissa McCarthy is now in early talks for one of the lead roles. McCarthy’s involvement is far from a sure thing, however, as her scheduling in between seasons of Mike and Molly is tight, and she has already committed to star in a comedy called Michelle Darnell, to be directed by her husband Ben Falcone. One other little detail that this news brings us is the revelation that Ghostbusters reboot is expected to start filming in June (which is why scheduling is tight for McCarthy). One of McCarthy’s Bridesmaids costars who had previously been mentioned, Rebel Wilson, is reportedly no longer in the running, and neither is Jennifer Lawrence (though Emma Stone still is, to the point that she’s been turning down other roles to leave her summer open for the possibility of starring in Ghostbusters). Other actresses said to be in the running are Jillian Bell of Workaholics and Cecily Strong of Saturday Night Live. If Melissa McCarthy does sign on for Ghostbusters, it will be her fourth film with director Paul Feig after Bridesmaids, The Heat, and this summer’s Spy (5/22/15).&nbsp;#6 PAUL RUDD JOINS THE REVISED FUNDAMENTALS OF CAREGIVINGFor many people, the big Paul Rudd news this week was the debut of the first Ant-Man trailer (more on that below), but there was also a new movie deal for Rudd that nothing to do with founding members of The Avengers. Paul Rudd has signed on to star in an adaptation of the Jonathan Evison novel The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving. Paul Rudd will play a character who befriends “a young adult stricken with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The two form a unique bond and gently push each other toward re-engaging in life in an affecting, funny and inspirational tale of broken people coming to terms with difficult lives.” The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving will be directed by Late Show with David Letterman executive producer Rob Burnett, who made his directorial debut in 2012 with the indie film We Made This Movie. David Letterman’s Worldwide Pants is also co-producing this independent film. And now, back to the superhero comedy Ant-Man. One new detail that emerged this week along with the trailer is the revelation that the final writing credit is for both Paul Rudd (cowriter of Role Models) and Adam McKay (cowriter of the Anchorman films). Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish will receive a “story by” credit for their work on earlier drafts of the Ant-Man script.Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 SHREK DIRECTOR TAKES ON ZOMBIES AND ROBOTS WITH INHERIT THE EARTHDirector Andrew Adamson’s career took off in the 2000s with a streak of four family films (the first two Shrek and Narnia movies), three of which are Certified Fresh. Since 2008, however, it’s been a rougher patch, with Shrek Forever After, Cirque Du Soleil: Worlds Away, and Mr. Pip all receiving Rotten Tomatometer scores. For his next film, Adamson appears to be plotting something of a career shift. Out are the talking donkeys and woodland critters of Narnia, and in are robots and evil zombies. Andrew Adamson has signed on with Sony Pictures to direct Inherit the Earth, which is an adaptation of the IDW Publishing comic book Zombies vs. Robots. Inherit the Earth will tell the story of a group of robots who team up to protect a young girl who is the last human alive on Earth from a “pack of intelligent zombies.” Hopefully, Andrew Adamson can turn around his recent Rotten streak with this film.&nbsp;#2 LIAM NEESON TO REMAKE THE ESCAPISTLiam Neeson is continuing a streak of film prolificacy which makes Michael Caine or Morgan Freeman look like Daniel Day-Lewis. His latest film Taken 3 just opened in theaters today, and thus far has a 12% Rotten Tomatometer, which is low even for an actor whose recent films have included Taken 2 (21%), Battleship (34%), Third Person (23%), and A Million Ways to Die in the West (33%). This week, Neeson signed to star in a remake of The Escapist, the 2008 UK prison movie which marked the directorial debut of Ruper Wyatt, who recently directed the remake of The Gambler, which marked his Tomatometer low point to date, with just a score of 45%. Rupert Wyatt will produce the remake, and the project is apparently still seeking a new director.&nbsp;#1 NOTHING IS OVER FOR RAMBO… EXCEPT THE FRANCHISESylvester Stallone recently tweeted “Doing Scarpa based on Gangster Greg Scarpa after LAST BLOOD RAMBO…” That posting may have only used a few dozen characters, but it was enough for entertainment writers to extrapolate entire stories about Sylvester Stallone’s next two movies, using multiple paragraphs, sentences, and correct punctuation. Stallone’s next project is going to be the Rocky spinoff Creed, which starts filming this month in Philadelphia. Stallone will play Rocky Balboa, an elderly ex-boxing-champion who coaches the grandson (played by Michael B. Jordan) of Apollo Creed, one of his former opponents. Creed will be the seventh time Sylvester Stallone has played Rocky Balboa. Then, the 68-year-old Sylvester Stallone will direct and star in Rambo: Last Blood, the fifth and final film about Vietnam War veteran John Rambo (who first appeared in an adaptation of the novel First Blood, hence the title’s reference). After Creed and Rambo: Last Blood, Stallone will then start work on Scarpa, a gangster movie based on the life of Colombo crime family hitman and FBI informant Gregory “The Grim Reaper” Scarpa. It’s not expected that Scarpa will end up having multiple sequels. Here’s Sylvester Stallone’s Tomatometer, which has been dominated by Rotten splotches ever since his 1974-1982 run of films with much better reviews.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Video, Watching, doctor, awards, Marvel, DC, tv","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-justin-lin-takes-over-star-trek-3"},{"id":"47509201194484","title":"Weekly Ketchup: X-Men: Apocalypse Finds Its Jean Grey, Storm, and Cyclops","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: X-Men: Apocalypse Finds Its Jean Grey, Storm, and CyclopsPlus, Simon Pegg will write Star Trek 3, a female leads the first Star Wars spinoff, and DreamWorks lays off 500.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 23, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup seasons and compliments ten of the biggest recent news stories from the world of movie development, which lately means lots and lots of superhero movies (including Aquaman, Doctor Strange, Suicide Squad, and X-Men: Apocalypse). There’s also new roles for Jennifer Lawrence and Nicolas Cage, and very bad news for DreamWorks Animation.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryJEAN GREY, STORM, AND CYCLOPS CAST IN X-MEN: APOCALYPSEThe movie has been out several for several months now, so let’s presume this isn’t an X-Men: Days of Future Past spoiler anymore, but the film’s ending rebooted the X-Men continuity at a point in the early 1970s, setting up the last 40+ years as being potentially quite different. Or put much shorter, Bryan Singer and crew fixed the mistakes of 2006’s X-Men: The Last Stand. The next film, X-Men: Apocalypse, is billed as the closer of the second trilogy, being set in the 1980s (after First Class was set in the 1960s, and DoFP in the 1970s). We’ve known for a while now that the new setting would re-introduce the characters of Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey (who’s unlikely to ever be called “Marvel Girl” in a Fox movie), and yesterday, Bryan Singer Tweeted out who the three new stars are. The most recognizable face and name is probably Sophie Turner, who Games of Thrones fans know as Sansa Stark (the red-haired would-be bride to Prince Joffrey). Sophie Turner has not been as active outside the show as many of her costars, so being cast as Jean Grey represents something of a big deal for her fans. The new Storm will be played by singer/actress Alexandra Shipp, who played the title character in the Lifetime biopic Aaliyah: The Princess of R&amp;B, and has a supporting role in this summer’s N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton. As for the new Cyclops, before this, Tye Sheridan was probably best known for playing the kid in Mud whose name wasn’t Neckbone. Oscar Isaac also commented this week about his costume for the movie’s big bad (and title character), Apocalypse, explaining that physical effects will be “aided with some robotic technology.” Finally, in what shouldn’t be too surprising, considering when this movie will be set, Patrick Stewart confirmed this week that neither he nor Sir Ian McKellen will return for X-Men: Apocalypse, with the roles of Professor Xavier and Magneto having now been fully handed over to James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique), Nicholas Hoult (Beast), and Evan Peters (Quicksilver) will also return for X-Men: Apocalypse when it’s released next year on May 27, 2016.Fresh Developments This Week#1 JENNIFER LAWRENCE TO REUNITE WITH HUNGER GAMES DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVEEven as Jennifer Lawrence prepares to work for the third time with director David O. Russell, and costars Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro on the “Miracle Mop” biopic Joy, this week, she signed on for another biopic that is also a reunion project. This time, it’s someone Lawrence has worked with even more times than David O. Russell, as director Francis Lawrence (no relation) has helmed the last three sequels to The Hunger Games. Jennifer Lawrence will star in the biopic The Dive, as one half of a married couple who shared a passion for freediving, in a pursuit to discover how deep they could dive on a single breath of air. The story of Francisco “Pipin” Ferraras and Audrey Mestre (Lawrence) is described as “tragic” for a reason, so if you don’t want to be spoiled any more (than that single word suggests), be wary of clicking on that link, or using a preferred method of searching for their names. Underwater enthusiast James Cameron is producing The Dive through his Lightstorm Entertainment.&nbsp;#2 SIMON PEGG TO COWRITE STAR TREK 3Fans of director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) who were disappointed when the Star Trek 3 gig went instead to Fast and Furious franchise stalwart Justin Lin received some good news this week. Frequent Wright collaborator (and the franchise’s Engineer Scotty) Simon Pegg has signed with Paramount Pictures to cowrite Star Trek 3 along with TV writer Doug Jung (Dark Blue, Banshee). That, however… is about all we know about the sequel right now. There’s been speculation since the first film that at least one sequel would offer alternate versions of adventures from the TV show, and what we got instead (though not strictly inaccurate) was basically a remake of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.&nbsp;#3 CHIWETEL EJIOFOR: FROM 12 YEARS A SLAVE TO DOCTOR STRANGEWhen Chadwick Boseman was revealed last October to have been cast as Marvel’s Black Panther, it ended a period of speculation that included 12 Years a Slave star Chiwetel Ejiofor. If this week’s news goes through well, it’s looking like Ejiofor will still get his chance to appear in at least one Marvel film. Marvel Studios and Chiwetel Ejifor are reportedly in early discussions for the actor to take on an unspecified “lead” role in Doctor Strange, which may or may not be villainous. Five strong contenders for such a role seem to be the Ancient One (Doctor Strange’s mentor), Wong (Strange’s own assistant), and the villains Baron Mordo (likely to be the “main” villain), Dormammu, and Nightmare. Benedict Cumberbatch will play Stephen Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme, when Marvel Studios releases Doctor Strange on November 4, 2016.&nbsp;#4 THE FIRST STAR WARS SPINOFF TO HAVE A FEMALE LEADAfter so much time hearing that the Star Wars “spinoffs” would be prequels for characters like Han Solo, Boba Fett, and Yoda, it had to be surprising for many fans this week that the lead character might actually be a female. Given the massive scale of the Star Wars universe and the films, it’s easy to imagine that the older characters could play supporting roles (especially since that seems to be what’s going on to some degree with Star Wars: The Force Awakens, as well). It’s also possible that the “female lead” will be joined by a “male lead.” The specific news is that Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) are both testing for the female lead in the first Star Wars spinoff, with Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything) also in the running. Promoting Strange Magic, George Lucas also generated some Star Wars news this week, clarifying that yes, he did work on the prequels, and that his work was discarded when Disney acquired Lucasfilm (which is basically what we had heard at the time of the acquisition as well).&nbsp;#5 KARL URBAN: JUDGE DREDD, STAR TREK, AND… AQUAMAN?It’s difficult to tell if this was just a slow week for “official” announcements, or if “rumor” sites (in particular Latino Review) just over-performed. With that caveat in mind, the aforementioned site offered some updates about Warner Bros’ Aquaman, which in their DC Comics pipeline is over three years away, after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, Justice League Part 1, and The Flash. That the movie is that far off is itself a reason to be skeptical of too many details at this early stage. But, yes, it was a slow news week without such rumors, so here we are. The story suggests that Warner Bros is hoping to recruit Karl Urban to play a lead role, possibly as a villain to Jason Momoa’s title character, with no suggestion of who that might be (Black Manta and Ocean Master seem like two possibilities for someone of Urban’s “type”). The rest of Latino Review’s story involves who might direct, for which they say the top contenders are Jeff Nichols (Mud, Take Shelter) and Noam Munro (300: Rise of an Empire), both of whom have ties to Warner Bros.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 THE SEARCH FOR SUICIDE SQUAD LEADER IS NOT SO PAINLESSLast week, we learned that Tom Hardy had dropped out of playing Suicide Squad leader Rick Flag, with talk at the time being that Warner Bros was hoping Jake Gyllenhaal would take the role instead. Well, that didn’t last long, and now Warner Bros remains on the hunt for a replacement for the super villain team film they’ve scheduled for August 5, 2016, just over 18 months from now. According to rumors/reports (who can tell which are which somedays), two actors who might be top contenders are Joel Edgerton (Exodus: Gods and Kings) and Jon Bernthal (Shane from The Walking Dead). Both are fine actors, but it’s looking more and more like Warner Bros is scaling back their Ocean’s Eleven-with-super-villains all-star package, at least for this role (the importance of which may have been scaled back when The Joker and Harley Quinn were added to the story). Also in the “rumors” category this week was talk that Gary Sinise and Joe Manganiello (True Blood, Magic Mike) might be cast as General Ealing and Deathstroke the Terminator, respectively. And finally, there was yet another Suicide Squad rumor this week, which is that Ben Affleck might appear in the film as a way of setting up a solo Batman movie (more than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice already does, apparently?). Whichever of these stories pans out, the cast of Suicide Squad also includes (in various stages of negotiations and/or rumor control): Jai Courtney (Captain Boomerang), Viola Davis (Amanda Waller), Cara Delevinge (Enchantress), Jesse Eisenberg (Lex Luthor), Jared Leto (The Joker), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn), and Will Smith (Deadshot). Of course, if Suicide Squad ends up like Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice did, we might only be halfway through the cast of characters at this point. (This story isn’t so much a “Rotten Idea” as it is less a “Fresh Development”).&nbsp;#3 NICOLAS CAGE TO HUNT DOWN OSAMA BIN LADIN AS AN ARMY OF ONEOn some level, a person might just want to give Nicolas Cage a certain amount of respect for the movies he chooses to sign onto. The list of Hollywood “name” actors who have eaten live cockroaches for a role is extremely short, not to mention his work with other insects. Is Nicolas Cage an “actor” or the best paid performance artist ever? His latest role looks like a case of Cage of playing with his image a bit, as he will star in a satirical comedy called Army of One. Larry Charles will direct, marking only the second time he’s ever directed a narrative feature that didn’t have Sacha Baron Cohen in the lead role (after Borat…, Brüno, and The Dictator). Army of One will tell the true story of Colorado construction worker Gary Faulkner, who makes it his own personal mission to travel to Afghanistan and Pakistan… to find Osama bin Ladin (before his assassination, obviously). Like Charles’ films with Cohen, Army of One is described as “semi-scripted,” so Nicolas Cage will have plenty of latitude for improvisation and his signature emoting and, if we’re really, really lucky, a few good (NSFW) freak outs.&nbsp;#2 TERROR MAY HAVE NO SHAPE, BUT THE BLOB IS STILL GETTING “RESHAPED” (AGAIN)We may grouse about horror remakes, but admittedly, Hollywood has cyclically retread older films before, such as in the 1980s, when we got new versions of movies like The Fly, The Thing, Cat People, and The Blob. In the case of The Blob, both the original 1958 film starring Steve McQueen and the 1988 remake have Fesh Tomatometer scores, which leads directly to the question: why do we need a second remake? Since the monster in The Blob is a huge red glob of flesh-eating goo, you can probably guess what the answer is going to be. Director Simon West, whose filmography includes the remakes The Mechanic and When a Stranger Calls, remarked, “With modern CGI we can now fully realize the potential of The Blob. The world I create will be totally believable, immersive and emotionally satisfying.” Simon West’s most recent film was 2012’s The Expendables 2, which has the distinction of being West’s first Fresh Tomatometer score as director after six other films, including Con Air, The General’s Daughter, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, and Stolen.&nbsp;#1 BAD BOX OFFICE LEADS TO 500 LAYOFFS AT DREAMWORKS ANIMATIONAs the 19th highest grossing animated film of all time, How to Train Your Dragon 2 was also the best earning animated film of 2014. A wider look at DreamWorks Animation’s last several releases tells a different story, especially against expectations, as Rise of the Guardians, Turbo, Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman, and Penguins of Madagascar all underperformed (ie, less than $320 million worldwide for each) (that’s four out of six, with The Croods being the other hit). In response, DreamWorks Animation has announced a 500 job cut (of their 2,400 worldwide total), mostly at Glendale and Redwood City in California. The shift will narrow down their production to two animated films a year (from a previously planned three), which will consist of one new concept and one sequel each year. China will also be joining with DreamWorks to co-produce Kung Fu Panda 3 for its 3/18/16 release. Especially hit hard (besides, you know, all of the hundreds of people who are unemployed now) on the release slate are the non-sequels, with two of the previously scheduled films (B.O.O.: Bureau of Otherworldly Operations and Mumbai Musical) and several others likely farther from being produced (like Captain Underpants, Lidsville, and Hot Stuff the Little Devil). The seven films still left on the schedule for 2015 through 2018 are: Home (3/27/15), Kung Fu Panda 3 (3/18/16), Trolls (11/4/16), Boss Baby (1/13/17), The Croods 2 (12/22/17), Larrikins (2/16/18), and How to Train Your Dragon 3 (6/29/18).For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"TruTV, Islander, Netflix","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-xmen-apocalypse-finds-its-jean-grey-storm-and-cyclops"},{"id":"47509201191410","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Lionsgate CEO Teases Hunger Games Prequels and Sequels","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Lionsgate CEO Teases Hunger Games Prequels and SequelsPlus, new roles for Brad Pitt, Felicity Jones, and Bryan Cranston; a Neighbors sequel; and an adaptation of Robotech.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 6, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes development news stories for such movies as The Hunger Games (Part 5?), Neighbors 2, and new films from directors Ang Lee and Robert Zemeckis, as well as new roles for Bryan Cranston and Brad Pitt.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryFour Movies may not be enough for The Hunger GamesAuthor Suzanne Collins may have been able to finish up The Hunger Games with a trilogy of books (so far), but it’s sounding like Lionsgate may not be quite done with the franchise yet, even as we await the fourth film later this year. That’s right: this week, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer told financial analysts that he’s “actively looking at some development and thinking about prequel and sequel possibilities” for the Hunger Games franchise. That simple statement is pretty much all we know about this “story,” but it’s certainly enough for anyone familiar with the books or movies to speculate about. Many writers are doing what we’re going to do, and just set aside the idea of a “sequels” because, well… what would the point of sequels be? Prequels, however, do seem like they have story potential, since there’s decades of “world building” that led up to the moment Katniss Everdeen volunteered as a tribute. This would include the forming of the districts (and what led to it), the first ever Hunger Games, and the various games which were won by characters from Catching Fire, such as Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), and Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) (some of whom would obviously have to be recast because of age). As for a reason Lionsgate might want to keep making Hunger Games movies, as the saying goes, Lionsgate probably sees 2,267,444,367 reasons.Fresh Developments This Week1 THIS WEEK IN BRAD PITT NEWS: MALICK’S VOYAGE OF TIME, AND ANOTHER WITH ZEMECKISBrad Pitt’s name came up three different times this week, associated with completely different films (only one of which he will actually be “starring” in, dramatically). That film is an untitled “sweeping romantic thriller” which is also described as being “epic”, and that’s about all we know, except that it will be directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Flight, and the upcoming The Walk). Well, that, and that it is based upon a story idea by screenwriter Steven Knight (Eastern Promises, Locke, Dirty Pretty Things). Brad Pitt will also narrate the 40 minute IMAX version of a documentary called Voyage of Time from director Terrence Malick, based on filming he first did for the film The Tree of Life (which Pitt also starred in). There will also be a feature length version of the movie, but it will feature completely different narration from actress Cate Blanchett. Finally, Brad Pitt was represented this week as a producer in the news that Charlie Hunnam has replaced Benedict Cumberbatch in the long-in-development adaptation of The Lost City of Z, about British explorer Percy Fawcett, who disappeared while searching for a legendary civilization in the Amazon jungle. Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller will also costar in the film.2 DIRECTOR ANG LEE TO FILM THE IRAQ WAR IN ULTRA HFR 3DThe effort to popularize HFR projection hit something of a stumbling block three years ago when Peter Jackson’s first Hobbit movie was released in the format (which presents images at twice their normal speed), and the reaction was mixed, both popularly and critically. This sort of thing has, however, happened in the past. New advances in film technology are not always instantly embraced (in fact, they rarely are), with sound, color, 3D, and computer animation all now widely accepted techniques, after years or decades of development. The latest director to pick up the HFR banner from Peter Jackson is Ang Lee, who has announced plans to use a new format called Ultra HFR 3D for his next film. Instead of the boxing movie previously expected to be Lee’s next film, the director is now focusing on an an adaptation of a novel by Ben Fountain called Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk, about a harrowing battle during the Iraq War. Ang Lee is wasting no time, with an April filming start date expected. The next step is for Ang Lee to find his young star, and for the job, he’s considering four fresh faces who are currently nearly unknowns (at least by name). That quartet includes British TV actors Joe Cole and Billy Howle, American/Irish actor Jack Treynor (Transformers: Age of Extinction), and Taron Egerton, the star of the upcoming action film, Kingsman: The Secret Service.3 THE BATTLE FOR THE STREET CONTINUES… IN NEIGHBORS 2When the frat boy comedy Neighbors finished 2014 with a $268 million worldwide box office (currently ranked at #30 for the year), it was probably an obvious certainty that Universal Pictures would pursue a sequel, and quickly. That was confirmed this week by the news that Universal Pictures has scheduled a release date of May 13, 2016 for Neighbors 2, which currently puts the sequel in between Captain America: Civil War (5/6/16), and the video game adaptation Angry Birds (5/20/16). Director Nicholas Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, The Five-Year Engagement) and stars Zach Efron, Seth Rogen, and Rose Byrne are all expected to return for the sequel. There are currently no known details about the sequel’s premise, but an easy guess would be that the married couple again find themselves in some sort of situation where they are directly conflicted by the same fraternity, or possibly alumni of the fraternity. Rose Byrne also made the news this week because her character, Moira MacTaggert, has been confirmed to be returning in next year’s X-Men: Apocalypse.4 FELICITY JONES: FROM THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING TO… STAR WARSFollowing recent news that Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Tatiana Maslany (TV’s Orphan Black) had also auditioned for the role, we learned this week who is now in negotiations for the female lead in the first Star Wars spinoff film. That role is expected to instead go to Felicity Jones, who is now in negotiations with Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Pictures. In addition to costarring in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (as a character widely believed to be Black Cat), Felicity Jones is probably best known for costarring in the recent Stephen Hawking biopic, The Theory of Everything. We don’t know the premise or title of the spinoff yet, but we do know that it will be directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters, Godzilla), from a script by Chris Weitz (Antz, About a Boy, Down to Earth), and that Disney has already scheduled the film for December 16, 2016.5 CLASSIC ANIME FRANCHISES ROBOTECH AND ASTRO BOY TO COME A-LIVE (ACTION)Apparently coincidentally, this past week saw news stories emerge about two separate live action adaptations of franchises best known for their portrayals as Japanese anime TV shows. One of them is the long-in-development project at Warner Bros to produce a movie based on Robotech, which is remembered by many as a TV series imported to the U.S. in the 1980s about the efforts to fight back alien invasions using giant “mech” robots. Past efforts at Warner Bros have included personalities like Tobey Maguire and Batman and Robin writer Akiva Goldsman, but the new producers hope to attract the interest of Mama director Andy Muschietti (though he isn’t signed yet). Meanwhile, the Australian production company Animal Logic (which provided the animation for The LEGO Movie, most famously) is now developing a live-action adaptation of the classic Japanese manga and anime franchise Astro Boy. This announcement comes just six years after the 2009 CGI movie Astro Boy proved to be both a box office and critical disappointment. Animal Logic is currently looking for screenwriters to start work on adapting Astro Boy as a live action film.6 JAMIE FOXX TO STAR IN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE REMAKE SLEEPLESS NIGHTOne of the first announcements to come out of this year’s Berlin film market concerns the English-language remake of the 2011 French crime thriller Sleepless Night. Jamie Foxx and Michelle Monaghan will star in the remake, which will be produced and distributed by Open Road Films (picked up out of turnaround from Warner Bros). Jamie Foxx will play a police detective whose plans to rip off a gang of drug dealers goes horribly wrong when they respond by kidnapping his son. The Sleepless Night remake will be directed by Baran Bo Odar, who made his debut with the critically well-received 2013 film The Silence.Rotten Ideas of the Week3 AMY PASCAL LEAVES SONY AFTER THE INTERVIEW-RELATED HACKING FALLOUTThis is definitely a very debatable story which someone else could interpret differently, which is totally what the comments section is great for. This week, after nine years as chairperson of Sony Pictures (and 27 years total at the studio!), Amy Pascal stepped down from her position to focus instead on a new production company based at the studio. This news comes just a couple of months after Amy Pascal was a central figure in the hacked Sony Pictures e-mail leaks, in which Pascal and producer Scott Rudin traded messages joking about what movies President Barack Obama might like. Reasons to consider Pascal’s departure a “Rotten Idea” include the highlights of her career, such as the reboot of the James Bond franchise, the heights of the Spider-Man franchise, the two 21 Jump Street movies, and such acclaimed films as The Social Network, Moneyball, and Zero Dark Thirty. There’s also the most obvious distinction, which is that Amy Pascal is/was the only female executive at any major studio, and with her departure, the conversation now turns to which white male executive will be her replacement. On the other hand, the argument can also be made that “progress” means that a person who should step down because of mistakes does so, regardless of gender (or race). And, finally, there’s also the most obvious reason for Pascal’s departure, which is that in recent years, Sony has been having trouble competing with other studios, especially in the realm of “big blockbuster tentpoles.” That issue may also ultimately decide who lands the job as Pascal’s replacement.2 BRYAN CRANSTON AND JAMES FRANCO TO COSTAR IN DUBIOUS BATTLEJames Franco is continuing his prolific second career as a director with an adaptation of one of John Steinbeck’s less famous novels, In Dubious Battle, about a union strike by fruit pickers in the 1930s. James Franco will also star in the film, along with Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Selena Gomez (who costarred with Franco in Spring Breakers), Vincent D’Onofrio, Robert Duvall, Ed Harris, and Danny McBride (Franco’s frequent costar in movies like Pineapple Express, Your Highness, and This is the End). The critical reactions to most of Franco’s directorial efforts have been Rotten to date.1 MILLA JOVOVICH TO EXPLORE IN THE LOST LANDS, BASED ON GEORGE R.R. MARTIN STORIESConsidering the popularity of HBO’s Game of Thrones, it was inevitable that other stories written by George R.R. Martin would eventually be adapted as movies. Surprisingly, there has never been a movie based on one of Martin’s works (though the Wild Cards superhero anthology epics that he edited and contributed to have been in development since the early 2000s). This week, from out of Berlin’s annual film market, we learned that Milla Jovovich is now in talks to star in a movie called In the Lost Lands, which is indeed based upon three of George R.R. Martin’s fantasy stories (that have nothing to do with Westeros). In the Lost Lands will be a German production, and will be written, produced, and directed by Constantin Werner, who most recently directed the 2009 Czech fantasy The Pagan Queen, which has no RT reviews, but received a “very negative” critical reception in the Czech Republic. Add in the fact that only one of Milla Jovovich’s last eight films received a Fresh rating, and that’s pretty much all the reason you need for this to be the week’s Most Rotten Idea.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"thirty, Month, TruTV, heist, Carpet, The, nbcuniversal, blockbuster, Pictures, El, Marvel, Music, America, DirecTV, actors","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-lionsgate-ceo-teases-hunger-games-prequels-and-sequels"},{"id":"47509201189361","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Spider-Man Will Join the Marvel Cinematic Universe","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Spider-Man Will Join the Marvel Cinematic UniversePlus, new roles for Jennifer Lawrence, Marion Cotillard, Jason Momoa, and Peter Dinklage.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 13, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s film development news cycle was sort of dominated by one of the biggest stories in recent memory (Spider-Man finally joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe), but there was also talk of new roles for Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt (as a sci-fi romantic couple, even), Academy Award winner Marion Cotillard in Assassin’s Creed, and new information about both Deadpool, and the third solo Wolverine movie.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StorySPIDER-MAN TO JOIN THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSEOne of the most confusing things about superhero movies for people not deeply invested in following them is the division between the cinematic adaptations of various Marvel Comics characters. Try explaining explaining why or how The Avengers, X-Men, Spider-Man, and The Fantastic Four all reside at separate studios. Well, this week, after a few months of rumors and speculation, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures announced that they have come to a resolution that will bring Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe films produced by Marvel Studios. A new version of Spider-Man will debut in an upcoming Marvel Studios movie (probably Captain America: Civil War on 5/6/16, because Spider-Man was a big part of Civil War in the comics). The web-slinger will then star in a new solo movie for Sony Pictures, which Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige will produce and will be scheduled for July 28, 2017 (the ramifications of that date are discussed down below). Sony and Marvel are now looking for a new younger actor to play Spider-Man as the character will be returned to high school, with Logan Lerman (Fury) and Dylan O’Brien (The Maze Runner) mentioned as two early possibilities. As that implies, Andrew Garfield is out as Spider-Man, as is director Marc Webb, but the planned Spider-Man spinoffs, like Venom, The Sinister Six, and a mystery-female-character project all remain in development, although their connections to Spider-Man will probably now be different (separate from The Amazing Spider-Man 2, for example). With Spider-Man now joining the MCU, that also opens the door to various MCU characters (including those not yet introduced) to appear in Sony’s movies, in addition to Marvel’s. As for the money behind all of this, the arrangement is described as being more like a “lease” than a sale, with no money being exchanged, and Sony benefitting from Marvel’s talent, creative supervision, and input, while Marvel obviously benefits from getting a big chunk of their characters back. So, going forward, you only have to explain to your confused uncle how Marvel’s characters are only split in half instead of thirds.Fresh Developments This Week1 LAWRENCE AND PRATT MAY COSTAR IN SCI-FI ROMANCE PASSENGERSThe science-fiction-romantic-drama Passengers has had a twisty-turny path through development over the last several years. For a long time, Keanu Reeves was attached to star, and past studios have included Focus Features and the Weinstein Company. Sony Pictures bought the project (in hindsight, one of Amy Pascal’s last major new projects) in December, and since then, the project is quickly taking on a very different profile. Norwegian director Morten Tyldum, who is an Academy Award nominee for The Imitation Game, is attached to direct this story of a man who accidentally wakes up 90 years early on an interstellar spaceship, so he wakes up a woman to be his companion (to basically share his plight, which is sort of a crappy thing to do to someone). For the two leads, Sony is shooting big, with Chris Pratt in talks to play one lead, and Jennifer Lawrence in talks to play the other. Lawrence and Pratt have a lot in common professionally, as they both star in Marvel Comics adaptations (albeit at different studios), which in both cases are just one of their franchises (Lawrence also has The Hunger Games), and Chris Pratt also has Jurassic World, and possibly, if rumors prove true, Indiana Jones.2 MARION COTILLARD JOINS MICHAEL FASSBENDER IN ASSASSIN’S CREEDWe’re coming up on the time of the year when actors and actresses start to see immediate and obvious reactions to their Academy Award nominations and wins. French actress Marion Cotillard won a Best Actress Oscar for the Edith Piah biopic La Vie en Rose, and is nominated in the category again this year for Two Days, One Night. Cotillard also plays Lady MacBeth in an upcoming adaptation of William Shakespeare’s MacBeth, and this week, she landed a role that is a reunion with that film’s star and director. Marion Cotillard has landed an unspecified lead role in the video game adaptation Assassin’s Creed, in which Michael Fassbender will star, and which will be directed by Justin Kurzel, who also directed MacBeth. Presuming the film will be an adaptation of the first game in Ubisoft’s franchise, there’s a few characters that Marion Cotillard could play, including the modern character of Lucy Stillman (voiced by Kristen Bell in the game), or one of the female characters in the 12th century Levant settings. 20th Century Fox has scheduled Assassin’s Creed for December 21, 2016 (five days after the first Star Wars spinoff, scheduled for 12/16/16).3 PATRICK STEWART MAY COSTAR AS PROFESSOR X IN THE WOLVERINE 2Although it probably shouldn’t have been as surprising as it seemed, Patrick Stewart was quoted this week as saying that he may costar as Professor X in the upcoming sequel to The Wolverine (which is sometimes listed as Wolverine 3, and which 20th Century Fox has scheduled for March 3, 2017). Here’s a direct quote from Patrick Stewart: “And what I’m very excited about is that we have been talking about a Wolverine movie, which would team Hugh Jackman and myself together. Wolverine and Professor Xavier. That would be a very different sort of X-Men from the four movies that I’ve already done.” This news seems to connect the Wolverine sequel more directly to the ending of The Wolverine, which many had previously interpreted as being a teaser to X-Men: Days of Future Past). Another possibility is that it might tie the third film to the deleted ending in which we were given a glimpse of a Wolverine mask similar to the ones Wolverine wears in the comics. And speaking of superhero masks, Ryan Reynolds gave fans a tease of the Deadpool mask he will be seen wearing a year from now, when the film is released on February 12, 2016. In other Deadpool news, several actresses are currently being considered for the film’s female lead, including Morena Baccarin (Firefly, Homeland) and Taylor Schilling (Orange is the New Black). Another actress, Gina Carano, has landed a supporting role as “Angel Dust” (the name of one of the Morlocks in the comics). The same story also mentioned that one of the characters in Deadpool will be X-Men member Colossus, although the story doesn’t mention if he will again be played by Daniel Cudmore (though Cudmore did play the character in X-Men: Days of Future Past, so there’s a good chance?).4 ROBOCOP STAR JOEL KINNAMAN REPLACES TOM HARDY IN SUICIDE SQUADA few weeks ago, Tom Hardy dropped out of starring in Warner Bros’ DC Comics adaptation Suicide Squad, as the leader of a group of super villains brought together by the government. Warner Bros had reportedly talked to both Joel Edgerton (Exodus: Gods and Kings) and Jon Bernthal (Fury, The Walking Dead), but today, we’re hearing that the actor who’s landed the role of Rick Flag is instead Joel Kinnaman. These days, Kinnaman is probably best known for starring in last year’s remake of RoboCop, but the Swedish actor has also costarred in AMC’s The Killing. Suicide Squad will be directed by David Ayer (End of Watch, Sabotage, Fury), and Warner Bros has scheduled the film for August 5, 2016.Rotten Ideas of the Week5 JASON MOMOA SNACKS ON CANNIBAL ROMANCE THE BAD BATCHWith five RT-rated films under his belt (and his 12 pack), Jason Momoa is still searching for his first Fresh Tomatometer score. It’s possible that might happen with one of his DC Comics movies, like Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (3/25/16), Justice League Part One (11/17/17), or Aquaman (7/27/18). Another possibility is The Bad Batch, which Jason Momoa started negotiations to star in this week. The Bad Batch is described as a dystopian love story set in a Texas wasteland plagued by cannibals, like a cross between The Road Warrior and Pretty in Pink. Whatever you think of that premise, the film’s best shot at a Fresh rating might come from its director, Ana Lily Amirpour, whose first film, A Girl Walks Home at Night, which was billed as the world’s first Iranian vampire western, was Certified Fresh at 95 percent. The mix of Jason Momoa’s filmography and Amirpour’s debut success makes this one a “borderline” Rotten Idea story.4 THE NEW SPIDER-MAN MOVIE SHUFFLES FOUR MAJOR MARVEL MOVIES BACKOne of the under-reported downsides of the new Spider-Man movie landing a release date on July 28, 2017, is that Marvel Studios had previously scheduled the three-quel Thor: Ragnarok for that date. What Marvel did this week to make room for Spider-Man was move four of their previously announced films into each other’s previous release dates. So, now Thor: Ragnarok is scheduled for November 3, 2017, instead of Black Panther, which is now scheduled for July 6, 2018, instead of Captain Marvel, which is now scheduled for November 2, 2018, instead of Inhumans. Despite events on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. seeming to set up the movie, the Inhumans movie is now over four movies away from release, with a new date of July 2, 2019. Amidst all this movement, the two parts of Avengers: Infinity War are holding onto their release dates of May 4, 2018, and May 3, 2019. This is leaving some fans to scratch their heads because it suggests that the events of these four films are not necessarily as connected to what’s going on in the concurrent Avengers movies as you might have expected. Specifically, Black Panther now comes out after Avengers: Infinity War Part 1, and Inhumans comes out after Avengers: Infinity War Part 2 instead of before it. As for why we’re calling this story a Rotten Idea? Marvel Studios hasn’t had a Rotten film yet, and so the idea of having to wait longer for four new Marvel Studios movies is a Rotten Idea.3 PETER DINKLAGE TO STAR IN LEPRECHAUN COMEDY O’ LUCKY DAYWhen Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage was cast in an unspecified role in last year’s X-Men: Days of Future Past, there was much immediate speculation that, of course, he would be playing Canadian superhero Puck, because, well, obviously, they’re both short. Unfortunately, logic classes are not required in the United States. Peter Dinklage is a talented actor, so it can’t be presumed that every role he takes will have anything to do with his height. This week, however, it sort of can, because Dinklage is signed to star in O’ Lucky Day, a comedy which might do for leprechauns what Bad Santa did for Santa Claus. That’s the good news. The bad news is that O’ Lucky Day will be directed by Adam Shankman, who has 13 credits to his name as director or producer since 2003, and only Hairspray received a Fresh score. Dinklage will play “a con man who may or may not be a real Leprechaun, but who certainly passes himself off as one.” The plan is for filming to start in April, while Peter Dinklage is on hiatus between seasons of Game of Thrones.2 HALLOWEEN: THE NIGHT HE CAME HOME (AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN…)Even if you’re old enough to remember what a sensation the original Halloween was in 1978 and 1979, your younger self probably would have never predicted that there would be a future where the Halloween franchise included 10 movies, including a reboot, a sequel to that reboot, and a third movie that didn’t even have anything to do with the other nine. We do, however, live in that world, and so we now bring you the news that Dimension Films has hired the writers of several of the Saw movies (a franchise that itself had seven entries), to work on a new Halloween movie. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, who wrote Saw IV, Saw V, Saw VI, and Saw 3D: The Final Chapter have Tomatometer pages that are almost entirely Rotten, except for Pacific Rim. Melton and Dunstan’s work on this Halloween movie is being described as neither a remake, a reboot, or a reimagining, but rather as a “recalibration.” So, how are we to interpret that? Will this 11th Halloween instead be a new sequel, featuring the further adventures of some version of Michael Myers (either Rob Zombie’s, or the “O.M.M.”)? Or perhaps a third interpretation of the character, without telling any previous story (somehow)? And since the Saw guys are involved, will the new Halloween be more about torture than just straight up machete-driven serial killing? In somewhat related news, New Line Cinema is now developing a remake of the 2014 New Zealand horror comedy Housebound (which hasn’t yet been released in the USA, outside of film festivals).1 FIFTY SHADES OF GREY TRILOGY MOVING FORWARD, BECAUSE OF COURSE IT ISRotten Tomatoes is a site dedicated to providing a gauge of critical reactions to various movies and TV shows (you know that, right?). Unfortunately, it is not critical opinion that is used to make decisions in Hollywood. And so, as the $40 million Fifty Shades of Grey is expected to make well over that in its first weekend alone, this story should not come as any sort of surprise. Universal Pictures has officially confirmed plans to adapt E.L. James’ sequel novels Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed as feature films, presumably with the same stars, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson. (This story actually broke on the morning of February 6, but it didn’t get noticed by most sites until after last week’s column went live.) As of this writing, Fifty Shades of Grey has a Tomatometer score of 27%.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Winter, films, Tubi, america, Film, Talk, emmy, disaster, toy, Tumblr, TV, Watching, Walt, American","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-spiderman-will-join-the-marvel-cinematic-universe"},{"id":"47509201209853","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Who Will Play X-Men: Apocalypse‘s Cyclops and Jean Grey?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Who Will Play X-Men: Apocalypse's Cyclops and Jean Grey?Plus, new projects for Chris Pratt, Steve McQueen, Melissa McCarthy, and Keanu Reeves.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 21, 2014 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes movie development news stories about movies such as Captain America: Civil War, and new remakes of 1984 and Going in Style, and a new Tinker Bell movie. There’s also new roles for Andrew Garfield, Melissa McCarthy, Chris Pratt, and Keanu Reeves.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryWHO WILL BE THE NEW CYCLOPS AND JEAN GREY IN X-MEN: APOCALYPSE?As has been expected for months, we learned this week that 20th Century Fox is looking for a young actress and actor to play Jean Grey (Marvel Girl) and Scott Summers (Cyclops) in 2016’s X-Men: Apocalypse. Presumably, they would continue to star in future X-Men movies after that as well, as the new chronology stretches out of the 1980s (of Apocalypse) and into the 1990s and beyond. Based on the six names we heard about this week, it looks like Fox wants an established young actress for Jean Grey, and more of a “fresh face” for Cyclops. For Jean Grey, the three actresses mentioned are Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass), Elle Fanning (Maleficent), and Hailee Steinfeld (True Grit). Three of the young male actors reportedly in talks to take over the Cyclops role from James Marsden are Timothee Chalamet (Interstellar), Ben Hardy (a recent EastEnders star), and Charlie Rowe (Walking with Dinosaurs 3D). Director Bryan Singer is returning for X-Men: Apocalypse, which starts filming in early 2015, and is scheduled for release on May 27, 2016.Fresh Developments This Week#1 DIRECTOR PAUL GREENGRASS IS WATCHING YOU, 1984Right now, we’re in the middle of something of a post-apocalyptic golden age — well, except, sometimes, for the “golden” part. Especially in the YA genre, “post apocalyptic” is a hot keyword right now, with such movies as The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, The Giver, and Divergent all being set in distant (and usually dirty) futures. Might this be the cue for one of the most admired modern directors to take on one of the urtext novels that helped found the genre? Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, Captain Phillips) is now attached to direct a new adaptation of George Orwell’s 1984, which is being developed by Sony Pictures and producer Scott Rudin. There have been a few previous adaptations of 1984, but the one most of us know was actually released in 1984, and starred John Hurt, Richard Burton, and lots and lots of disturbing nudity. It will take some time for 1984 to be developed, and in the meantime, Paul Greengrass will next be directing a return to the Bourne franchise, along with star Matt Damon.&nbsp;#2 DANIEL BRüHL CAST AS A CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR VILLAIN… BUT WHO?A late breaking news story last Friday came from Marvel, but there wasn’t enough time to sneak it into the Weekly Ketchup, so you get to see it here, finally. German actor Daniel Brühl (Rush, The Fifth Estate, Inglourious Basterds) has been cast as “one of the villains” in Marvel Studios’ Captain America: Civil War, but what we don’t know is which villain that is, exactly. Fans over the weekend quickly started a guessing game, with Baron Zemo winning out most often (being both one of Captain America’s classic villains, and also the leader of the Thunderbolts, a team of villains pretending to be heroes, a theme that could play into Civil War). Something that potentially complicates such speculation is the mention by Variety that Brühl might also be the main villain in Doctor Strange. It’s unclear if this means the same character, or two different characters (something Marvel doesn’t repeat very often). If it is two different characters, one way to explain it could be that Brühl could provide the voice for Dormammu, Doctor Strange’s otherworldly villain whose face and head is just a big fireball. Or maybe Variety got their wires crossed. Anyway, Disney and Marvel will release Captain America: Civil War on May 6, 2016, and Doctor Strange on November 4, 2016.&nbsp;#3 HOLLYWOOD STRETCHES OUT: THE STAND, PLANET OF THE APES, AND FAST AND FURIOUSCoincidentally (or not), in the same week as the release of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 (stretching a 390 page novel into over four hours of movies), there were three different stories about similar moves. The less surprising of them concerns Stephen King’s The Stand, a post-apocalyptic novel with over 1,000 pages which was previously expected to be squeezed into just one or two movies. Director Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars) revealed this week that after he had indeed turned in a script that boiled The Stand into a single movie, Warner Bros asked him if he would instead like to do several films, and so that is now what he’s working on: The Stand as four movies. Another franchise that looks like it’s expanding is the rebooted Planet of the Apes, which Andy Serkis said this week might be four or five movies instead of the trilogy it was originally expected to be. Of course, this idea of stretching movies out could eventually lead to franchises wearing out their welcome. What if, for example, we start seeing more franchises going into double digits? That’s what might happen for the Fast and Furious franchise, if Universal does indeed make another three movies past Furious 7, as mentioned this week.&nbsp;#4 CHRIS PRATT TO STAR IN COWBOY NINJA VIKINGIn 2014, a comic book adaptation basically turned Chris Pratt from the chubby guy on Parks and Recreation into a legitimate movie star. For one of the first major deals he’s made since the success of Guardians of the Galaxy, Pratt has chosen another comic book, but this time, it has nothing to do with Marvel. Chris Pratt is now attached to star in Universal Pictures’ adaptation of the indie comic book Cowboy Ninja Viking. The title might make you think of Cowboys &amp; Aliens (also a Universal Pictures adaptation of an indie comic book), but that’s where similarities end. Cowboy Ninja Viking is a spy thriller about a program in which assassins are programmed with multiple personalities called “triplets,” and in the case of this movie’s star, the three identities are a cowboy, a viking, and a ninja. Now, imagine Chris Pratt play-acting like all three of those (sometimes at once), and you can sort of imagine the potential comedic hijinks.&nbsp;#5 DIRECTOR STEVE MCQUEEN’S FUTURE: TV ADAPTATION WIDOWS AND A PAUL ROBESON BIOPICDirectors — especially big-time directors with recently acquired Oscars like 12 Years a Slave helmer Steve McQueen — frequently have multiple projects that they’re working on. Every once in a while, you see a director talk about one of them, and soon after, a completely different project (that might be closer to happening) gets announced, so as not to have the other, potentially less certain film, get all of the press. This writer suspects something like that happened this week. First, Steve McQueen talked in New York at an event about his desire to direct a biopic about the life of singer, actor and activist Paul Robeson. The next day, Variety covered Steve McQueen’s next film… and it has nothing to do with Paul Robeson. Instead, McQueen will direct a “heist thriller” based on the 1980s British TV mini-series Widows, about four women who come together to finish the robbery that their husbands died trying to pull off.&nbsp;#6 MEL GIBSON TO DIRECT ANDREW GARFIELD IN WWII TRUE STORY HACKSAW RIDGEAre we ready for Mel Gibson’s comeback yet? How about as a director? Braveheart was pretty good, right? There have been almost-movies in recent years (like the Viking project with Leonardo DiCaprio), but nothing has happened yet. Now, Mel Gibson might have found the right combination in the form of Hacksaw Ridge, which is based on a true story from the Pacific theater of World War II. The Amazing Spider-Man star Andrew Garfield is in talks to star for Mel Gibson (also in talks) as Private Desmond T. Doss, who was drafted into service, but refused to fight on religious grounds. Ostracized for his beliefs, Private Doss (spoiler!) went on to save over 70 of his fellow soldiers during the Battle of Okinawa, going on to earn three Purple Hearts, two Bronze Stars, and a Congressional Medal of Honor. If Gibson does make Hacksaw Ridge his next movie as director, it will be his first such film since 2006’s Apocalypto.Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 KEANU REEVES TO STAR IN THE PANOPTICON FOR THE DIRECTOR OF IMMORTALS AND MIRROR MIRRORIf movies could only be judged on their visual spectacle, Tarsem Singh might be a three time Academy Award winner. With movies like The Cell, The Fall, Immortals, and (less so) Mirror Mirror, Tarsem Singh has given us some amazing bits of eye candy. The Fall came closest to being Fresh (at 59 percent), but usually, Singh’s films are criticized for other factors (pacing, tone, acting, etc). Can Keanu Reeves help him turn things around? We might find out if he signs on to star in Singh’s next film, called The Panopticon. The project is described as an “action thriller” about a man who receives “a pre-recorded message from himself, warning that the world is about to end and only he can save it.” There’s no word yet about whether The Panopticon will depict dream-like hallucinations and generous yards of red fabric blowing in the wind.&nbsp;#2 MELISSA MCCARTHY TO STAR AS TINKER BELLMelissa McCarthy is certainly a box office phenomenon, with Bridesmaids, The Heat, Identity Thief, and The Hangover Part III all making over $100 million domestically (also, breaking news: Melissa McCarthy was in The Hangover Part III). But her record seems a lot less impressive when you look at her Tomatometer, which shows that, of her last eight films, only Bridesmaids and The Heat earned Fresh Tomatometer scores. And don’t even get us started on director Shawn Levy (Just Married, The Internship), who, by this point, we sort of wish would lay off announcing new films so we could stop including his stories in the Rotten Ideas section. Having said all that, we haven’t even gotten to the really crazy part, which is that Melissa McCarthy is attached to star as Tinker Bell in an untitled comedy that Shawn Levy is attached to direct. J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan is now in “public domain,” which unfortunately means that Tinker Bell is pretty much fair game for this sort of comedy.&nbsp;#1 ZACH BRAFF’S FOLLOW UP TO KICKSTARTER: REMAKING GOING IN STYLETime has a way of making some movies much bigger deals for younger generations than they were at the time, and for other movies, it does sort of the opposite. Take for example, the 1979 caper comedy Going in Style, which was a modest hit for stars George Burns and Art Carney, and basically launched the career of director Martin Brest. Having said that, very few people today probably even remember Going in Style ever even existed. Maybe that’s actually why Zach Braff wants to follow up Garden State and Wish I Was Here by directing a Going in Style remake. Or why Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Dustin Hoffman want to be in talks to star in the same remake. We’re calling this one a “Rotten Idea” not so much because critics didn’t love Wish I Was Herebut because actors of a certain age keep trying to make these comedies about old guys going oout in style, and it keeps not working. Whether it’s Morgan Freeman in The Bucket List (40% Rotten) or Morgan Freeman in Last Vegas (47%)… Well, maybe it’s just Morgan Freeman, or the premise, or maybe both.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"video, cinematic, 2017, furious, dark, Spectrum, Network, caribbean, Arts","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-who-will-play-xmen-apocalypses-cyclops-and-jean-grey"},{"id":"47509201207804","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Wonder Woman Scores Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones Director","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Wonder Woman Scores Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones DirectorPlus, Star Wars rumors, James Bond rumors, Zoolander sequel news, and Channing Tatum's directorial debut.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 26, 2014 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup comes to you on a pre-Thanksgiving Wednesday, allowing for coverage of a few stories that didn’t fit in last Friday. Included in the mix are ten movie development news stories covering such films as James Bond 24, Wonder Woman, X-Men: Apocalypse, Zoolander 2, and a Janis Joplin biopic.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StorySAY HER NAME: BREAKING BAD DIRECTOR DEVELOPING WONDER WOMANAs Hollywood publicists prepared for their obligatory collective extended Thanksgiving vacation, some of the “big stories” this week were actually retreads of stories we’ve already covered in previous Weekly Ketchups. This can pose something of an editorial conundrum, because if we don’t include them, it looks like we’re ignoring some of the biggest news stories of the week (which is sort of the opposite of what this column is about). The first such story is that Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones director Michelle MacLaren has indeed signed on to develop and direct the Wonder Woman movie for Warner Bros and DC Comics. (Here’s our first coverage of this story, from just twelve days ago). In addition to directing, Michelle MacLaren will also develop the script with the film’s writers, who haven’t been announced yet. Warner Bros will release the Wonder Woman solo movie on June 23, 2017, after the character makes live action debut in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in March of 2016. Another story we’ve already talked about before which got a lot of new press this week is the buzz that Warner Bros wants Matthew McConaughey to play the villain Randall Flagg in their multi-film adaptation of Stephen King’s The Stand from director Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars). We first covered that story back in August.Fresh Developments This Week#1 DALLAS BUYERS CLUB DIRECTOR TO COVER JANIS JOPLINAfter directing one of last year’s most acclaimed films (Dallas Buyers Club), Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallée has another film (Wild, starring Reese Witherspoon) this year which is on many critics’ predicted “best of” lists for 2014. We already know what film will be next, and it’s Demolition, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Naomi Watts. Vallée’s next film after Demolition, however, might be another film based on a true story, like Dallas Buyers Club and Wild. That’s because the director has taken over development of the long-in-the-works Janis Joplin biopic in which Amy Adams is attached to star as the 1960s Texas blues-influenced pop star. Jean-Marc Vallée is taking on this Janis Joplin project after previous directors like Fernando Meirelles (City of God, Blindness) and Lee Daniels (The Butler, Precious) spent time working on it before eventually moving on. As part of his deal, Vallée has tasked his Dallas Buyers Club screenwriters Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack to work on the screenplay, which has to be creative in its scope, because the independent budget is expected to stay within the $15-$20 million range.&nbsp;#2 OSCAR ISAAC AS X-MEN VILLAIN APOCALYPSE: HE’S NOT NEW, AND NEVER GETS OLDFor the last 30 years, one of Marvel’s biggest, baddest villains, in or out of the X-Men titles, has been Apocalypse, the mysterious, seemingly immortal Egyptian mutant. The blue-and-grey super mutant has been so popular and influential that not only has he led various villain groups (including the Four Horsemen) and been the Big Bad in various events, but there’s even a hugely popular timeline and alternate reality called Age of Apocalypse. So, as production readies for X-Men: Apocalypse (5/27/16), the casting of Apocalypse himself is sort of a big deal. There had been talk that Tom Hardy might get the role, but instead, Inside Llewyn Davis star Oscar Isaac will star as Apocalypse. We’re still a year away from the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which also features Isaac, so 20th Century Fox might be playing the long game here, anticipating the star he might become not this year (or next year) but by the time 2016 rolls around (much like what Marvel Studios has been doing with their casting since Chris Evans was cast as Captain America). Oscar Isaac’s profile will continue to rise next month with the release of A Most Violent Year.&nbsp;#3 SPEAKING OF VILLAINS AND CATS… IS CHRISTOPH WALTZ BRINGING BACK ERNST BLOFELD?There’s a reason we haven’t seen the villain organization S.P.E.C.T.R.E. or characters like Ernst Blofeld in official James Bond movies since the 1970s (an uncredited Blofeld appeared in the beginning of the 1981 film For Your Eyes Only). Well, last year, the lawsuit preventing the use of Blofeld ended with a settlement, which leads us to this week’s rumor. Just two weeks ago, we first heard that Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained) was in some stage of negotiation to play a character in the untitled movie we can only call “James Bond 24” right now. London’s The Daily Mail (which has a strong recent history of reporting James Bond stories that turn out to be true) is reporting that Christoph Waltz will be playing none other than Ernst Blofeld. Even if you have only a fleeting familiarity with Bond villains, you’d probably recognize the iconic image of Ernst Blofeld (even if only it’s because you’ve seen an Austin Powers movie): the bald head, the scarred eye, the neutral tone Mao suit, the obligatory white cat, and the booby-trap dispatching of underlings. In an age dominated by cinematic superheroes and supervillains, are we finally ready again for Ernst Blofeld? MGM and Columbia Pictures have scheduled “James Bond 24,” whatever it ends up being titled, for November 6, 2015. Director Sam Mendes and franchise stars Daniel Craig, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, and Ben Whishaw are returning, along with new cast members Dave Bautista and Léa Seydoux.&nbsp;#4 THIS WEEK IN STAR WARS RUMORS: WILL THERE BE SOMETHING LIKE A BOBA’S SEVEN HEIST FILM?Guardians of the Galaxy proved audiences still enjoy space opera adventures featuring bandits, loveable scoundrels, and all-around badass wiseguys, so it should surprise no one that other studios are looking to produce similar films. Of course, Lucasfilm has the inside track on that sort of thing, since Han Solo is the character that basically defined that appeal for an entire generation (or two). With all that in mind, a new rumor is circulating that claims the Star Wars movie that director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla, Monsters) is developing is a “heist” movie about a group of bounty hunters hired to steal the plans for the original Death Star (ie, set before Star Wars: A New Hope). This rumor also ties into past talk that one of the “prequel spinoffs” would involve Boba Fett (Han Solo and Yoda might be the stars of the other two). If this rumor pans out, however, Boba Fett won’t be the “star” of this movie (though he could certainly be one of the bounty hunters); it will instead be a new character to be introduced in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. There’s already speculation that it could be the character played by veteran actor Max Von Sydow (because of his age), but that’s not necessarily a given in a galaxy with so many aliens and robots. In other Star Wars news, the first 88-second teaser trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens (12/18/15) will debut at select theaters this weekend, and probably online soon after (either officially or otherwise).&nbsp;#5 JURASSIC WORLD STAR BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD JOINS PETE’S DRAGONJust yesterday we saw the release of the first trailer for next summer’s Jurassic World, in which Bryce Dallas Howard is shown doing what Kitty from Arrested Development advised her kid to do: “run.” Within the last seven days, it was reported that Bryce Dallas Howard is in talks to join a very different movie (presumably) that’s also about a very, very big lizard-type beast. In the remake of Pete’s Dragon (which is sounding like it’s quite an altered update), Howard’s character would be a forest ranger who doesn’t believe the titular little boy has really befriended a dragon in the nearby forest which is being cleared by loggers. Robert Redford is already signed to play a local old man who tells crazy stories about a dragon that lives in the aforementioned woods. The Pete’s Dragon remake is being directed for Walt Disney Pictures by David Lowery, who’s making his big budget studio debut after impressing with last year’s indie hit Ain’t Them Bodies Saints.&nbsp;#6 PENELOPE CRUZ JOINS ZOOLANDER 2, WITH RIDICULOUS SEQUELS BACK IN VOGUEIt doesn’t take much to revive an old classic, even if the results aren’t always favorable. Take, for example, the “ridiculous comedy sequel.” We don’t really see that many of them anymore, but there was a time in the 1980s and 1990s when the release schedule was packed with movies like Weekend at Bernie’s II, Police Academy 5, or Austin Powers in Goldmember. All of this is pretense to the recent success of Dumb and Dumber To, and the impact it has reportedly had on other studios. Specifically, the long-in-development Ben Stiller sequel Zoolander 2 is finally getting close to production, with the news a week ago that Penelope Cruz has signed on to costar in the fashion industry spoof. Zoolander will always be a historical exception, because its $60 million box office total might have been much higher if its release date had not been September 28, 2001 (Hollywood just doesn’t move fast enough to cancel a release date 16 days away). Ben Stiller will once again direct Zoolander 2, hopefully to better effect than his last film as director, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. It’s not yet known which other Zoolander stars might return, such as Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson, Christine Taylor, Milla Jovovich, or David Duchovny.&nbsp;#7 DJIMON HOUNSOU TO REPLACE IDRIS ELBA IN KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLEEarlier this year, Idris Elba was mentioned as being in talks with Warner Bros to play a “Merlin-esque” character in their planned six-movie adaptation of the legends of King Arthur. Well, in the last seven days, we learned that the first movie is now called Knights of the Round Table, and that Djimon Hounsou is now in talks to play that character. Guy Ritchie, who successfully directed two Sherlock Holmes movies for Warner Bros, will direct this first film (and possibly the rest). Charlie Hunnam is attached to play King Arthur, Astrid Berges-Frisbey will play Guinevere, and Jude Law will play the first film’s villain (though we don’t know who that character is, yet). Warner Bros has scheduled Knights of the Round Table for July 22, 2016.&nbsp;#8 CHANNING TATUM TO MAKE DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH FORGIVE ME, LEONARD PEACOCKNow that critics and prognosticators are speculating that Channing Tatum might receive an Academy Award nomination for his role in Foxcatcher, it might have been inevitable that the star known for the two Jump Street films would ultimately want to direct. Well, co-direct, actually, but it still gets him a WGA card, so it counts. Channing Tatum and Magic Mike writer/producer Reid Carolin have signed a deal with the Weinstein Company to produce and co-direct an adaptation of a YA book called Forgive Me, Leonard Peacock. The book was written by Matthew Quick, who is a favorite at TWC following the success of the adaptation of his book Silver Linings Playbook. Channing Tatum will also costar as a high school teacher who intervenes in the plans of a troubled teenager who has plans to kill his best friend, and then himself. Yeah, Step Up, this is not. Tatum is also expected to make his big screen debut as Gambit in the aforementioned X-Men: Apocalypse in 2016 before going on to star in a Gambit solo movie.Rotten Ideas of the Week#1 RIDLEY SCOTT NOT DIRECTING BLADE RUNNER 2 AFTER ALLWe should start this article by acknowledging that when he turns 77 this Friday, Sir Ridley Scott is, like us all, going to be a few days closer to shuffling off this mortal coil. There’s only so many more films he’s ever going to direct, and that’s especially significant when we’re talking about a director who is sort of known for having multiple films in development at any given point. This all might indeed be a valid justification for this week’s news, but that’s not really the “Rotten Idea” part, which we’ll get to very shortly. Talking to Variety about Exodus: Gods and Kings, Ridley Scott revealed that he will no longer be directing the planned sequel to Blade Runner, which is still expected to start filming next year. Scott did not finish that de facto announcement by stating specifically who will be directing the sequel (which may or may not have saved this from being the week’s Rotten Idea), but he did give us an important plot detail, which is that the sequel is actually about finding Deckard, as played by Harrison Ford, who doesn’t really enter the movie until the third act. Instead of directing the Blade Runner sequel, Scott’s immediate future will be dedicated to directing The Martian (with Matt Damon) and the sequel to Prometheus. As for why all of this is a “Rotten Idea,” it’s because now, without Ridley Scott’s involvement, and with Harrison Ford only in one third of the movie, it leaves us wondering why we are getting a Blade Runner sequel at all.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Extras, TV, Netflix, Carpet, Land, love, Britbox, Rom-Com, blaxploitation, crime, cancelled","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-wonder-woman-scores-breaking-bad-and-game-of-thrones-director"},{"id":"47509202756103","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Terminator: Genisys Sequels Scheduled for 2017 and 2018","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Terminator: Genisys Sequels Scheduled for 2017 and 2018\n                        Plus, 23 Jump Street is happening, and new roles for Matt Damon, Orlando Bloom, Elizabeth Olsen, Rooney Mara, and Morgan Freeman.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 12, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes development news stories about 23 Jump Street, Legion of Super Heroes and Star Wars Episode VIII, as well as new roles for Matt Damon, Michael Douglas, and Morgan Freeman.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTERMINATOR #6 AND #7 SCHEDULED FOR 2017 AND 2018\n\nParamount Pictures’ Terminator: Genisys won’t be released until July 1, 2015, but this week, the studio already scheduled release dates for two sequels in what will form a new trilogy (movies #5, #6, and #7). The 6th film (under the in media res title of Terminator 2) is now scheduled for May 19, 2017 (the week before The LEGO Movie 2). The 7th Terminator film is scheduled for June 29, 2018, which is also a placeholder date for an animated film from 20th Century Fox (possibly Alienology, Left Tern, or Mutts). Although we don’t yet know what character he plays (in Terminator: Genisys), Doctor Who star Matt Smith is expected to return for both of these films in 2017 and 2018. The cast of Terminator: Genisys also includes Emilia Clarke (as Sarah Connor), Jason Clarke (as John Connor), Jai Courtney (as Kyle Reese), Lee Byung-hun, Dayo Okeniyi, J.K. Simmons, and Arnold Schwarzenegger as a Terminator.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 RETROFUTURISTIC LEGION OF SUPER-HEROES MOVIE RUMORED\n\nAlthough its popularity has waned a bit in recent years, in the past, one of DC Comics’ most popular titles was Legion of Super-Heroes. With a “retro futuristic” sheen and sense of fun, LSH depicted the adventures of dozens of teenage superheroes from various planets and alien races in the 30th century.  Although Legion of Super-Heroes started as a spinoff of Superboy (and he was a member for a long time, via time travel), some of the versions ditched the connection. Legion of Super-Heroes is also basically a property that is very easy to depict outside any other DC continuity, since it’s in the future, and most of the members have no current analog. And that, right there, might be why so many sources this week picked up on this story, which is currently just a rumor. Reportedly, Warner Bros is looking to start development on a Legion of Super-Heroes movie, basically as a reaction to the success of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. If there’s truth to the rumor, the gist seems to be that Warner Bros is putting out feelers to screenwriters and their agents, looking for pitches on what to do with LSH. So, there’s no writers attached, no directors, no cast, and no idea of a story, because ostensibly, even that isn’t known yet. For Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel started with a group of five members from a list of over 20 members, but Legion of Super-Heroes more than doubles (triples?) that. And, in other DC Comics movie news, we also saw some better images of the Batmobile from 2016’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice appear online. And on the TV front, there were also stories about potential live action TV shows based on Supergirl and (Teen) Titans, featuring Dick Grayson, AKA Nightwing. So, who are some of the commenters’ favorite LSH members that they’d like to see in a live action movie? Arm-Fall-Off-Boy, Bouncing Boy, Infectious Lass, Matter Eater Lad, Plaid Lad, Porcupine Pete, Shrinking Violet, Triplicate Girl, or someone else?\n\n\n\t\n#2 MARK RUFFALO BEGS RIAN JOHNSON TO CAST HIM IN STAR WARS EPISODE VIII\n\nAlthough J.J. Abrams is still filming Star Wars Episode VII, and there’s also going to be a “spinoff” movie first as well, Disney and Lucasfilm’s Star Wars Episode VIII was the movie this week with the biggest news item. Promoting Infinitely Polar Bear at the Toronto International Film Festival, Mark Ruffalo discussed his friendship with director Rian Johnson, whom Ruffalo worked with on The Brothers Bloom. When asked about Star Wars Episode VIII, Mark Ruffalo said that he sent Rian Johnson an e-mail that read, “Rian, congratulations on everything you?ve been doing. And by the way, if there?s a part in Star Wars, please, anything, please consider considering me to join you.” Mark Ruffalo may indeed have an inside track on such a role, considering that he is also one of Marvel’s biggest stars after his performance in The Avengers revitalized the big screen popular of The Hulk. Star Wars Episode VII is scheduled for December 18, 2015, the first Star Wars spinoff is scheduled for December 16, 2016, and Star Wars Episode VIII is expected to be scheduled sometime in 2017.\n\n\n\t\n#3 MATT DAMON TO SEE MANCHESTER-BY-THE-SEA\n\nFor writer-turned-director Kenneth Lonergan, eleven years ended up separating his first movie (2000’s You Can Count on Me) from his second (2011’s Margaret), but it looks like his wait for movie #3 won’t be as long. Matt Damon, who costarred in Margaret, is attached to star in Manchester-by-the-Sea, as a “a Boston-living ne?er-do-well plumber who is forced to return home to the titular town after he learns his brother passed away.”  (Manchester-by-the-Sea is a town on Cape Ann, in Massachusetts). Matt Damon is expected to film Manchester-by-the-Sea before starting filming (in November) of The Martian for director Ridley Scott.\n\n\n\t\n#4 CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE UNLOCKED: ORLANDO BLOOM AND MICHAEL DOUGLAS\n\nMichael Douglas and Orlando Bloom, who both have big movies coming in the next year (Ant-Man and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies), signed on this week to costar in a spy thriller called Unlocked. The two actors join the already cast Noomi Rapace, who will pay a CIA interrogator who “unwittingly provides information to terrorists and then must race against the clock to stop a biological warfare attack on London.” Unlocked will be directed by Michael Apted, whose filmography includes the James Bond film The World is Not Enough, the “Up” documentary series, Gorillas in the Mist, and Coal Miner’s Daughter. Orlando Bloom was also quoted this week as saying that he might return as Will Turner in Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean 5 (although he also might… not).\n\n\n\t\n#5 LOKI AND SCARLET WITCH TO WED IN I SAW THE LIGHT\n\nFirst, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) was married to her brother Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) in Godzilla, and now she will be partnering up with another Marvel star. Olsen, who plays the Scarlet Witch in next year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, has been cast as “Audrey Mae” in the biopic I Saw the Light.  Her character will be the wife of country singer Hank Williams Sr, who will be played by Tom Hiddleston, AKA Marvel’s Loki. I Saw the Light will be the second film as director for prolific producer Marc Abraham, who made his directorial debut with the inventor biopic Flash of Genius in 2008. As for Tom Hiddleston, he got practice with the role this week by performing as Hank Williams at the Wheatland Music Festival in Michigan, probably to people who lined up in the sweltering heat for hours, huddling together in the dark.   (We’re just saying, the man does know how to perform for crowds). Okay, now here’s a real link to Tom Hiddleston performing as Hank Williams, Sr at that festival.\n\n\n\t\n#6 23 JUMP STREET NOW IN DEVELOPMENT — TIME FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL?\n\nNow that the movie’s been out a few months, we can probably safely “spoil” the ending and reveal that the movie ended with Ice Cube’s character telling the two leads (played by Jonah Hill and Chaning Tatum) that their next assignment sends them to medical school. That was then followed by a series of joke titles for some 20 more sequels. This week, we learned that Sony Pictures is indeed now developing a sequel to be called 23 Jump Street.  It’s not confirmed that the sequel will in fact send the two undercover cops to “medical school,” but presumably, that is a logical step after high school and college. Screenwriter Rodney Rothman, who cowrote 22 Jump Street (and Grudge Match, and produced Get Him to the Greek and The Five Year Engagement) has been hired to start work on 23 Jump Street.\n\n\n\t\n#7 ROONEY MARA AND DANE DEHAAN TO STAR IN ORIGINAL MUSICAL ZIGGY\n\nAustralian writer-director Diesel Schwarze (AKA Daniel Schwarze) is described as a protege of Baz Luhrmann, having worked as the title designer on Moulin Rouge!, and now, he’s getting his own directorial debut on a film that seems like something Luhrmann would have himself directed.  Dane DeHaan and Rooney Mara are attached to star in Ziggy, an original film musical set in New York City in the 1920s, as, respectively, a “hunchback escape artist” and the woman he falls in love with, who’s engaged to a powerful media mogul.\n\n\n\t\n#8 MORGAN FREEMAN CAST IN TED 2 AND BEN-HUR\n\nMorgan Freeman had a busy week, as the acclaimed veteran actor was cast in two different movies (and he’s not even playing God or the President in either of them). Morgan Freeman has signed with Universal Pictures to work with writer/director/voice actor Seth McFarlane in Ted 2 as an “an iconic civil rights lawyer who comes into the picture when Ted needs to resolve some legal issues.” Seth McFarlane and Mark Wahlberg are currently filming Ted 2 in Boston, along with the recently cast Amanda Seyfried, and several celebrities making cameo appearances. Universal Pictures has scheduled Ted 2 for June 26, 2015. Morgan Freeman has also been cast by MGM and Paramount Pictures in the upcoming remake of Ben-Hur. Morgan Freeman will play Ildarin, who teaches the title character how to “become a champion-caliber chariot racer.”  The two studios are still working on finding their lead (as it looks like Tom Hiddleston probably won’t take the role, possibly because of the Hank Williams movie), and his friend-turned-rival Messala. The remake of Ben-Hur will be directed by Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), and it’s currently scheduled for release on February 26, 2016.\n\n\n\t\n#9 TORONTO INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL ACQUISITIONS 2014\n\nThis was a big year for distribution acquisition at the Toronto International Film Festival. What we’re talking about here are independently produced films which had their debuts at the festival, and then led to them getting picked up for release. The most active company was the Weinsteins’ RADiUS, which picked up three major films: the comedy Adult Beginners (with Rose Byrne and Nick Kroll), Chris Evans’ directorial debut Before We Go, and the romance The Last 5 Years (starring Anna Kendrick), which will be released in time for Valentine’s Day in 2015. Other distribution deals included the vampire drama What We Do in Shadows, the Taylor Lautner action movie Tracers, the awards-friendly Julianne-Moore-with-Alzheimer’s-drama Still Alice, the Hayden Christensen action movie American Heist, Pawn Sacrifice (Tobey Maguire as Bobby Fischer), and the Chris Rock dramedy Top Five.\n\n\n\nRotten Idea of the Week\n\nWe’re feeling generous (or maybe Hollywood is?).  No (completely) “Rotten Idea” stories this week.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"emmy, Red, Channel, america, Anna, versus, TV, Century, Disney, Western, crime, Golden, Martial","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Terminator-Genisys-Sequels-Scheduled-for-2017-and-2018"},{"id":"47509202760202","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Harry Potter Director Signs On for Fantastic Beasts","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Harry Potter Director Signs On for Fantastic Beasts\n                        Plus, an animated Noah's Ark, dueling Jungle Book news, and a November Man sequel.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 22, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nAs we continue through the dog days of summer on our way to Labor Day weekend and the start of the fall movie season, this Weekly Ketchup covers a particularly slow news cycle.  Instead of superhero movies, we mostly got movies about animals (Noah’s Ark, The Jungle Book: Origins) and other creatures (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), and long-running novel series stars (The Destroyer, Mack Bolan, and The November Man 2).\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nJ.K. ROWLING’S WORLD CONTINUES WITH FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM\n\nWe’ve known for a while about plans at Warner Bros to start a new film franchise adapting J.K. Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, set in the same magical world as the author’s Harry Potter series (but 70 years earlier, and in New York City. In what was admittedly a slow news week, the big news now is that for the first Fantastic Beasts film, Warner Bros has recruited director David Yates, who directed the four most recent Harry Potter movies. Yates is currently working for Warner Bros on their reboot of Tarzan (7/1/16) until November of 2014, and the first Fantastic Beasts movie is already scheduled for just four months later, on November 18, 2016. There is also speculation that the two “event movies” that Warner Bros has scheduled for November 16, 2018 and November 20, 2020 might be the second and third films in the Fantastic Beasts franchise, but that hasn’t been confirmed yet. The next step for Warner Bros and David Yates will probably be to cast the lead character, Newt Scamander, from whose name and perspective J.K. Rowling uses as a pen-name for the book.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 CUMBERBATCH, BALE, AND BLANCHETT HEADLINE THE JUNGLE BOOK: ORIGINS\n\nWhen Walt Disney Pictures was making the news every week with voice cast announcements for next year’s live action reboot of The Jungle Book (10/9/15), it seemed likely that the other competing project at Warner Bros was pretty much shelved. This week, however, brought a deluge of voice casting announcements for The Jungle Book: Origins (10/21/16) suggest that Warner Bros was just getting all of their cast lined up for one big press release. Let’s go through the cast by directly comparing the actor for each role (Warner Bros listed first, Disney listed second). First up, there’s Baloo the Bear (Andy Serkis vs Bill Murray), Bagheera the Black Panther (Christian Bale vs Sir Ben Kingsley), Shere Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch vs Idris Elba) and Kaa the Python (Cate Blanchett vs Scarlett Johansson), and Akela the Wolf Leader (Peter Mullan vs Giancarlo Esposito). That leaves us with characters that are only announced for one movie but not the other. In Disney’s movie, Christopher Walken will voice King Louie of the apes (a character who doesn’t appear in Rudyard Kipling’s book). In Warner Bros’ movie, there’s Tabaqui the Jackal (Tom Hollander). Finally, there’s casting which suggests the biggest difference between the two movies, as two different wolf chracters (Naomie Harris as Nisha and Eddie Marsan as Vihaan) will be Mowgli’s parents, versus just one, a wolf named Raksha in the book and Disney’s movie (voiced by Lupita Nyong’o). Comparing the voice casts directly, Disney’s movie has three direct connections to Marvel Studios films, while Warner Bros’ cast features, as you would expect, actors who have previously appeared in big budget WB/NLC productions (like The Dark Knight, The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc). The human boy Mowgli will be played in Disney’s movie by newcomer Neel Sethi, and in Warner Bros’ movie by Rohan Chand (Bad Words). Walt Disney Pictures’ The Jungle Book is being directed by Jon Favreau, and The Jungle Book: Origins is being directed by Andy Serkis, so there’s a chance you can look forward to images of Christian Bale collaborating cheerfully with cinematographers while wearing motion capture gear.  The Jungle Book: Origins was written by Callie Kloves, whose screenwriter father Steve Kloves (of the Harry Potter franchise) is producing the film.\n\n\n\t\n#2 DARK LIVE ACTION NOAH TO BE FOLLOWED BY ANIMATED COMEDY NOAH’S ARK\n\nEarlier this year, if any parents thought a live action Noah movie would be great for their young ones might have been surprised that it wasn’t so much about cute animals, and more about genocide, infanticide, and implied incest. If that left people thinking, “hey, someone should make an animated movie about the animals,” well, they weren’t alone. Unified Pictures is a new animation production company headed by veterans with connections primarily to DreamWorks and Disney. Unified Pictures has indeed announced that their first project will be Noah’s Ark, a CG animated comedy focusing on the animals, for release in 2016. This Noah’s Ark comedy will be directed by John Stevenson (codirector of Kung Fu Panda) from a script by Philip LaZebnik (The Prince of Egypt; cowriter of Mulan, Pocahontas) and TV writer Glen Dolman. The story in this version will focus on “an outcast aardvark by the name of Gilbert, who becomes the reluctant leader of a ragtag group of misfit animals that need to be led to the mighty ark before the impending flood. Along their journey, they band together to conquer unforeseen obstacles, and ultimately, Gilbert discovers within himself the inner strength and ingenuity to prove that in a world of ‘twos,’ he was truly destined to be ‘the one.'”  No voice cast have been announced yet, and Unified Pictures does not currently have a distribution deal for Noah’s Ark in 2016.\n\n\n\t\n#3 MARK WAHLBERG JOINS THE CREW OF DEEPWATER HORIZON\n\nFollowing the box office and critical success of last year’s Captain Philips, there continues to be a strong interest in Hollywood to adapt other recent headlines as feature films. One of those is Deepwater Horizon from Lionsgate and director J.C. Chandor (Margin Call, All is Lost, A Most Violent Year). As the title suggests, the movie will be about the 2010 British Petroleum oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico on board the oil rig called the Deepwater Horizon. The project has been progressing fairly quickly through development, and this week the next step was reached, as Mark Wahlberg is now in talks for one of the lead roles. Mark Wahlberg will play “the No. 2 manager on the doomed oil rig in the story about what happened behind-the-scenes in the 48 hours leading up to and the day of the disaster.” Although J.C. Chandor frequently writes the movies he directs, Deepwater Horizon comes from a script most recently drafted by Matthew Michael Carnahan (The Kingdom; cowriter of World War Z). Lionsgate expects to start filming in the late spring or early summer of 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#4 IRON MAN 3 DIRECTOR SHANE BLACK JOINS THE DESTROYER\n\nAlthough many relics of 1970s-1980s pop culture have already received their 21st century nostalgia revivals, something that has thus far sort of skirted outside the mainstream are the violent pulp novel franchises The Destroyer and The Executioner (more about that one down below).  Of the two, The Destoyer came the closest because it was adapted as the 1985 movie Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, which is now remembered mostly for being a would-be franchise-starter with an unfortunate name (and for Joel Grey not being at all Asian). This week, Sony Pictures announced that their feature film reboot of The Destroyer will be directed by Shane Black (Iron Man 3, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Shane Black is well known for his love of pulp heroes, especially because of his campaign to someday direct a new Doc Savage film (he remains attached to that one, too). The Destroyer is the story of a cop who is framed, sentenced to death, and “executed” as part of a top secret plan to use him as a government agent, aided by a pop culture-obsessed Asian mentor called Chiun. It’s not yet known which will come first: Doc Savage or The Destroyer.\n\n\n\nRotten Idea of the Week\n\t\n#5 THIS WEEK IN SUPERHEROES: DWAYNE JOHNSON CONFIRMS HE WILL BE IN SHAZAM… BUT NOT MUCH ELSE\n\nIn most weeks, the Weekly Ketchup features at least one major superhero story, but as we near Labor Day and the end of the Hollywood movie season, there wasn’t even much about superheroes. The one major story that broke this week is yet another story about Dwayne Johnson and the Shazam movie at WB/DC, which was “something,” but… not much.  Dwayne Johnson did confirm what we’ve already basically known, which is that he will be in a Shazam movie. However, about which role Dwayne Johnson will play, the wrestler-turned-actor said he “can’t decided” if he will pay Shazam (AKA Captain Marvel) or his nemesis Black Adam.  One has to wonder if the reason Dwayne Johnson is being so elusive about this question might not be because — they’re the same role? Since the Shazam story is about a little boy who transforms into a superhero, there might be a chance that both “Captain Marvel” and “Black Adam” look enough alike to be played by the same actor. Crazier things have happened. We’re going to call this a borderline “Rotten Idea” just because it’s getting frustrating that WB and DC won’t just directly announce this news. Also in the news this week was our first glimpses of Henry Cavill on the set of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in his Superman suit. Marvel Studios also had a similiar reveal this week, as Evangeline Lilly showed off her new haircut, which definitely resembles the hairdo traditionally sported by Wasp. Marvel attracted some bad “buzz” online recently (frequently with the hashtag #janetvancrime) because of reports that Evangeline Lilly’s character isn’t named Janet Van Dyne (but instead is “Hope Van Dyne”). There was also an image this week of Paul Rudd standing next to the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n\n\t\n#4 A BAD WEEK FOR FEMALE-LED ACTION MOVIES: LUCY 2, RESIDENT EVIL 6, THE EXPENDABELLES\n\nFor all of the talk about new movies that focus on female characters, especially in action movies, this week saw three different stories emerge that were bad news for, well, exactly those sorts of movies. We’re calling this a “Rotten Idea” in general, but of course, if you think any (or all) of these movies are themselves “Rotten Ideas,” then you may think these particular stories are “Fresh Developments.”  First up, there’s good news for Milla Jovovich, but bad news for Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, the sixth and last movie in the franchise for Jovovich and her director husband Paul W.S. Anderson. That good news/bad news comes in the form of Milla Jovovich’s second pregnancy, prompting the action movie star to take a break from fighting movie zombies and the Umbrella Corporation. Another actress who is also (very) pregnant (but starred in Avengers: Age of Ultron anyway) is Scarlett Johansson. Johansson recently had a hit action movie with Lucy, but this week, director Luc Besson revealed that it’s “unlikely” that there will ever be a Lucy sequel. Finally, there’s The ExpendaBelles, the all-female action movie that has long been planned as a spinoff of The Expendables, which got two bits of bad news this week. First, there was the disappointing box office news for The Expendables 3 itself, followed by word that Sigourney Weaver has passed on starring in The ExpendaBelles. Weaver had been seen as one of the older action stars needed to get the movie going (though actresses like Pam Greer and Linda Hamilton might still be strong alternative options for the project). Weaver also joined the cast of A Monster Calls this week, along with Toby Kebbell (Doctor Doom in next year’s The Fantastic Four).\n\n\n\t\n#3 BRADLEY COOPER REUNITES WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE HANGOVER FOR… MACK BOLAN\n\nUp above, we started talking about the violent pulp novels of the 1970s and 1980s in the story about The Destroyer, but the series that arguably had the bigger cultural impact (even without its own movie) was Mack Bolan: The Executioner, created by Don Pendleton.  Soon after the series started, Marvel Comics introduced a very similar guns-and-vengeance character called The Punisher, who obviously today is even more famous than the character that first inspired his creation. (That correlation between the two characters was even heralded by Marvel on the cover of one of their 1970s comics). This week, Warner Bros acquired the film rights to the character and the books, under the title of Mack Bolan, which isn’t incorrect, but it’s also sort of like announcing your big new superhero movie is called Peter Parker. Anyway, no deals are signed yet, but it’s reportedly hoped that Bradley Cooper will star as Mack Bolan, and that the film will be directed by Todd Phillips, who directed The Hangover, and its sequels. And right there, is where this story gets very weird. Bradley Cooper certainly surprised a lot of people with his performance as Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy, but there are limits. There’s pretty much nothing in common between Bradley Cooper and The Executioner. For a direct comparison, imagine that we’re reporting Bradley Cooper has been cast as The Punisher, in a really violent version of that character. As odd as that match would be, Todd Phillips is an even stranger choice. Add in that his Tomatometer has lots of green splotches, and this is solidly a “Rotten Idea,” or at best, a really, really “weird idea.”\n\n\n\t\n#2 JOHNNY DEPP AND KEVIN SMITH TEAM UP FOR YOGA HOSERS\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that the Weekly Ketchup was reporting about Kevin Smith’s promises to retire from directing. Now, we’re reporting that Smith is 1/3 a new “True North” trilogy of movies set in Canada. That, however, is not the weird and/or Rotten part. Nope, that would be the news that Johnny Depp has joined the cast of a new Kevin Smith movie called Yoga Hosers. Okay, let that title seep in a little while we also tell you that the movie is full on in “nepotism” mode as the two teen stars of the movie will be Harley Quinn Smith and Lily-Rose Depp, AKA the daughters of Kevin Smith and Johnny Depp. The two celebrity daughters will play “yoga nuts” who “have an after-school job at a Manitoba convenience store called Eh-2-Zed. When an ancient evil rises from beneath Canada’s crust and threatens their big invitation to a Grade 12 party, the Colleens join forces with a legendary man-hunter from Montreal named Guy Lapointe (Depp) to fight for their lives with.” In addition to Smith’s daughter and the Depp duo, the entire cast of Smith’s upcoming horror film Tusk will also be in the movie, which includes: Ralph Garman, Justin Long, Harley Morenstein, Haley Joel Osment, Michael Parks, and Genesis Rodriguez. New cast members will include: Adam Brody, Austin Butler, Tony Hale, Natasha Lyonne, Jason Mewes, and Tyler Posey. Here’s a link to Kevin Smith’s green-splotch-riddled RT Tomatometer.\n\n\n\t\n#1 PIERCE BROSNAN’S 0% FRESH THE NOVEMBER MAN ALREADY GETTING SEQUEL\n\nAs of this writing (3:00 PM PST, 8/22/14), next week’s The November Man, starring Pierce Brosnan has a 0% RT Tomatometer score. Now, obviously, a lot more reviews will be coming in next week, and so we might be proven wrong here, but right now… it doesn’t look good. Anyway, take that prognostication with a grain of salt (although it’s not particularly common that GREAT reviews are saved for the day of release). Regardless of what critics are saying, Relativity Studios has announced that they are already developing a sequel to The November Man. The movie is based on a character from a long-running series of novels by the late author Bill Granger, so there are lots of stories for Relativity to adapt in continuing movies about the ex-CIA agent played by Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan, who is already signed to star in The November Man 2, is also currently suffering through a streak of Rotten scores on his Tomatometer.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"hidden, Plus, tv, sports, versus, Geo, CBS, Captain, Mary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Harry-Potter-Director-Signs-On-for-Fantastic-Beasts"},{"id":"47509202744832","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Marvel Announces Avengers: Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel, and More","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Marvel Announces Avengers: Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel, and MorePlus, new roles for Chadwick Boseman, Seth Rogen, Renee Zellweger, and Eric Bana, as well as a Michael Bay Benghazi movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 31, 2014 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup includes lots of big news for various Marvel superhero movies (like Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, and two new Avengers movies), as well as news about Steven Spielberg’s The BFG, and new roles for Ricky Gervais, Keanu Reeves, Seth Rogen, and Renee Zellweger.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryMARVEL ANNOUNCES AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, CAPTAIN MARVEL, AND MORETwo weeks ago, Warner Bros and DC Comicsmade a big announcement of their movie plans stretching out to 2020, and this week, it was Marvel Studios’ turn. Given the nearly weekly deluge of news stories about their various projects, it was sort of a given that not all discussed at the Marvel event would be news, but at least half of it legitimately was. The new non-sequels announced were Black Panther (11/3/17), Captain Marvel (7/6/18), and Inhumans (11/2/18), and the new sequels announced were Thor: Ragnarok (7/18/17), Avengers: Infinity War Part I (5/4/18), and Avengers: Infinity War Part II (5/3/19). Among movies we already knew about, the title of Captain America: Civil War was confirmed (after some joking that it would be called Captain America: The Serpent Society). The release date of Guardians of the Galaxy 2 was bumped up two months to 5/5/17 (from 7/28/17), along with a video message from director James Gunn expressing that he and his friends wanted to spend the whole summer with us. A more “inside baseball” detail that slipped in was that Marvel’s Phase 2 would be ending with Ant-Man, and not Avengers: Age of Ultron, as previously expected (based on Phase I ending with Marvel’s The Avengers). Many of these films have been anticipated for years now, and some of them are directly set up by other Marvel films. We see something (and someone) in the Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer which seems to set up Black Panther, the Kree Empire of Guardians of the Galaxy has direct connections to both Captain Marvel (who is definitely Carol Danvers) and Inhumans (who are the result of ancient Kree genetic experiments on Earth). As for Thor: Ragnarok, the title has a double meaning as Thor: Ragnarok was the title of an event immediately before the Civil War event (in which Thor and the Norse Gods seemed to be destroyed), and “Ragnarok” was the name of a Thor clone used during Civil War. In other Marvel news, which was overlooked by most in the hubbub, this Marvel Experience announcement revealed that Marvel Studios is currently trying to lock up a movie deal for… She-Hulk.Fresh Developments This Week#1 CHADWICK BOSEMAN TO STAR AS BLACK PANTHERSome superhero movies go through months and months of casting “stories” for their stars (see below), but the process for Marvel’s Black Panther was relatively free of all of that. Oh, sure, back in August, there was a rumor that Chadwick Boseman (of the Jackie Robinson and James Brown biopics) had landed the role, but there hadn’t been much more than that. So, this week, it was somewhat refreshing when Kevin Feige started talking about Black Panther (11/3/17), and he was joined onstage by… Chadwick Boseman, the star of 42 and Get On Up. This news came along with the first official glimpse at concept art for the Black Panther movie costume, which combines the character’s traditional look with some new features like tribal-style stripes throughout, an embedded fang necklace, and what looks like zippers around the toes (which are probably deadly foot blades or something). Kevin Feige also confirmed of Black Panther that “We will meet him for the first time in [Captain America:] Civil War, in costume.” In the meantime, we still don’t know anything else about Black Panther, such as who is writing or directing the film, but there’s still over three years before release, too.&nbsp;#2 BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH FINALLY WINS THE DOCTOR STRANGE CASTING CALL… MAYBEIn the movie development news coverage business, you get very used to the cycles of casting for certain high profile projects and roles, with some taking months or even years, with several actors at various points claimed to be in talks or in the running. One of the longest running such cycles this year was for Doctor Strange (11/4/16). The Doctor Strange casting stories have included Joaquin Phoenix (who seemed to be closest), Ethan Hawke, Tom Hardy, Jared Leto, Justin Theroux, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Ewan McGregor. Well, this week one of those actors was announced as actually being in talks to star as Doctor Strange, and it was Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock, Star Trek Into Darkness). Or at least, we think so. The Benedict Cumberbatch news was reported by Variety on Monday night before the Tuesday press conference, at which Marvel’s Kevin Feige said, “If it were confirmed, we would introduce him today.” By the Vishanti and the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth, can this madness just end? (So we can spend two years speculating about who will star as Captain Marvel and the Inhumans?). If Benedict Cumberbatch did/does indeed sign on to star in Doctor Strange, he will be working with director Scott Derrickson (Sinister, The Exorcism of Emily Rose).&nbsp;#3 SETH ROGEN TO PLAY STEVE WOZNIAK TO CHRISTIAN BALE’S STEVE JOBSNow that Christian Bale is signed to star in the next biopic about Apple founder Steve Jobs, it appears we’re going to be hearing more details about the film start coming out fairly regularly, leading up to the start of filming. Seth Rogen has signed with Sony Pictures to star as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The film, which may be also called Jobs (even though that was also the title of the Ashton Kutcher movie), will be directed by Danny Boyle (28 Days Later, Slumdog Millionaire) from a script by Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network, The West Wing). Jessica Chastain is also being “eyed for an unspecified role.” Seth Rogen also made the news late on Friday as one of the stars of Zeroville, an independent ensemble piece to be directed by Rogen’s friend James Franco. Rogen and Franco will be joined by Will Ferrell, Megan Fox, Dave Franco, Joey King, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Horatio Sanz, and Jacki Weaver. Zeroville will be an adaptation of a 2007 novel by Steve Erickson. James Franco will play a film fan who has Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift tattooed on his head who’s confused with a member of the Manson Family when he arrives in Hollywood in the 1960s; the comedy spans decades into the 1980s, through the decline of the studios and the rise of “independent renegade directors.”&nbsp;#4 STAGE ACTOR MARK RYLANCE TO BE STEVEN SPIELBERG’S THE BFGAnother “big” role that we might have expected to attract much speculation was cast this week with pretty much nothing of the sort preceding it. DreamWorks Studios has announced that director Steven Spielberg (Jurassic Park, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) has cast three-time Tony Award winner stage actor Mark Rylance as the title and lead role in The BFG, an adaptation of the children’s book by Roald Dahl. Although Mark Rylance has spent most of his career on the stage, movie fans may recognize him from such movies as Anonymous, The Other Boleyn Girl, and Prospero’s Books. Mark Rylance will play a benevolent giant who teams up with a young girl and the Queen of England to stop the invasion plans of evil, man-eating giants. About Mark Rylance, Steven Spielberg said, “I am excited and thrilled that Mark will be making this journey with us to Giant Country. Everything about his career so far is about making the courageous choice and I’m honored he has chosen The BFG as his next big screen performance.”&nbsp;#5 DIRECTOR JASON BATEMAN INVESTS IN IPO MAN TRUE STORYAfter making his directorial debut earlier this year with the darkly biting comedy Bad Words, comic actor Jason Bateman has lined up his next such project, after his second film, The Family Fang, starring Nicole Kidman. The third time around, Bateman’s film IPO Man will be based upon a true story as told in a 2013 Wired article called “Meet the Man Who Sold His Fate to Investors at $1 a Share.” The comedy will tell the story of a software customer service representative who split himself up into 100,000 shares priced at $1 each, of which 928 were actually purchased, mostly by friends, family, and his girlfriend. Which was great and all, until his “stock holders” started wanting to take control of how the man made decisions about his finances.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 RENEE ZELLWEGER TO BE SAME KIND OF DIFFERENT AS METhere are dozens of actresses currently in their 40s, but only one of them was pretty much the hot button topic on social media last week. Presuming the old adage about even bad publicity being good publicity is at least half right, Renee Zellweger’s agent was able to land her a new movie this week. Renee Zellweger, Greg Kinnear, Djimon Hounsou, and Jon Voight (all of whom are either Oscar nominees or winners) will all star in Same Kind of Different As Me, based on a non-fiction book by Ron Hall and Denver Moore, with Lynn Vincent (who also wrote Heaven is for Real, which was a recent hit film for Greg Kinnear). The story depicts how four people’s lives intersect around the ministry founded by a woman with cancer. Same Kind of Different as Me will be the feature film debut of director Michael Carney, who previously directed a 2012 short film called Jew. This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based on the 42% Rotten score earned by Heaven is for Real.&nbsp;#3 ERIC BANA AND RICKY GERVAIS TO TEAM UP FOR WRITER/DIRECTOR RICKY GERVAISEric Bana and Ricky Gervais are signed to star in an English-language remake of the 2009 French comedy Special Correspondents (in French, Envoyés Très Spéciaux). Frequently compared to Wag the Dog, the original film involved France negotiating for the release of two kidnapped journalists in Iraq, except that they were really “kidnapped,” in that the whole thing was fake. Ricky Gervais wrote the adaptation, and will direct (unfortunately, the RT Tomatometer scores for Gervais’ films as writer and director have been mostly Rotten). In Gervais’ version, Eric Bana will play “an arrogant, struggling New York-based radio journalist who fakes frontline war reports from a Spanish restaurant in Manhattan as a desperate ploy to save his job.” Ricky Gervais is also scheduled to write, direct, and star in Life on the Road, a mockumentary feature that will act as a sequel to Gervais’ original British version of The Office, starring his character of David Brent.&nbsp;#2 KEANU REEVES TO EXCLAIM, “WHOA, I KNOW NEUROSCIENCE!” FOR SCI-FI THRILLER REPLICASKeanu Reeves had success last week with John Wick, and like any savvy Hollywood veteran star (or that star’s savvy agent), Keanu Reeves used that momentum this week to set up a new deal. The deal in question involves a new science fiction thriller called Replicas, which is based upon an idea by Keanu Reeves and producer Stephen Hammel (who is also working with Reeves on the sci-fi drama Passengers). The premise of Replicas sees Keanu Reeves playing a “neuroscientist whose family is killed in a traffic accident so he uses his knowledge to try to bring them back, going up against the government, the police and the laws of science.” We’re calling this one a Rotten Idea based not just on the incredulity of Keanu Reeves playing a neuroscientist capable of this sort of science fiction stunt, but also based on the dominance of the green splotches on Keanu Reeves’ RT Tomatometer.&nbsp;#1 MICHAEL BAY TO DIRECT BENGHAZI ACTION THRILLER 13 HOURSOne of the political hot button issues since 2012 has been the incident at Benghazi, Libya, which left U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and another American dead. Going into the details about what people think or know or say happened at Benghazi would take far, far, far more space than we have in this little section of the Weekly Ketchup. You can start at Wikipedia, or go to the political news site or blog of your choice, for your own version of the events that day (which happened to be on September 11, 2012). What really matters here isn’t Benghazi itself, but who is now associated with Benghazi because of this week’s news. Bombastic blockbuster enthusiast extraordinaire and director Michael Bay has started negotiations to direct 13 Hours, an adaptation of a book by Mitchell Zuckoff about the attack on the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. Although Michael Bay is best known for directing such films as Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, Bad Boys II, and the Transformers franchise, it’s expected that 13 Hours will have a budget more in line with his recent relatively-low-budget action movie Pain and Gain. So, there you go… Michael Bay is probably going to direct a movie about Benghazi. Here’s Michael Bay’s Tomatometer Page. We’re done here.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Sci-Fi, News, screen, Witch, Rey, fiction, Extras, drama","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-marvel-announces-avengers-infinity-wars-captain-marvel-and-more"},{"id":"47509202757128","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Live Action Ghost in the Shell Finds Its Lead Actress","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Live Action Ghost in the Shell Finds Its Lead Actress\n                        Also, new projects for Jessica Chastain, Zac Efron, Julia Roberts, Ben Affleck, and George Clooney.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 5, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup covered a short week following Labor Day, but even so, there was still news, mostly because Hollywood types are up in Toronto making deals as the film festival started there. Movie projects that made the news this week included C.H.i.P.s, Ghost in the Shell, and Shazam, and new roles for Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Zac Efron, Julia Roberts, and Zoe Saldana, and news about actors-turned-directors Ben Affleck, and George Clooney.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nLIVE ACTION GHOST IN THE SHELL LANDS LEAD\n\nThe live action Akira adaptation is still in “development hell,” but this week, another manga/anime adaptation reached a milestone on its way to actually happening. Margot Robbie is an Australian actress currently best known for costarring last year in Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street (she’ll also play Jane in Tarzan in 2016). Robbie is also now in talks with DreamWorks to star as the cyborg cop leading character in Ghost in the Shell. In addition to being a popular Japanese manga created by Masamune Shirow, Ghost in the Shell has also been adapted as two anime movies, and various video games and anime television productions. The live action Ghost in the Shell will be directed by Rupert Sanders (Snow White and the Huntsman) from a script by screenwriter Bill Wheeler (this will be his first produced credit). On its surface, Ghost in the Shell can sound a bit like a female-centric RoboCop, but the difference is in the “cyber crimes”, the cyberpunk setting (ala The Matrix or Blade Runner), and the lack of “armor.” The Snow White and the Huntsman prequel — aptly titled The Huntsman —  will be directed by Frank Darabont (The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption), with Chris Hemsworth returning as the title character.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 ZOE SALDANA, ELLE FANNING, AND SIENNA MILLER JOIN BEN AFFLECK’S LIVE BY NIGHT\n\nOnce upon a time, Ben Affleck’s next film as director was supposed to be released by Warner Bros for late 2015. And then, the actor signed on to play Batman in a series of films, and Live by Night, and other Affleck-directed projects were pushed back. A year later, Live by Night is starting to gear up for production, with a release date a year later, on October 17, 2016. Zoe Saldana, Elle Fanning, and Sienna Miller have all signed on to join Ben Affleck (who will star, as well as direct). Sienna Miller has appeared in movies like Layer Cake and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Elle Fanning has starred in Super 8 and Maleficent, and Zoe Saldana has starred in Avatar, Star Trek, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Live by Night will be an adaptation of a novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, Shutter Island) about a Boston mobster (Affleck) who climbs up the organized crime ladder. Miller will play a mob leader’s girlfriend, Fanning will play an aspiring actress, and Saldana will appear in the film’s Tampa scenes.\n\n\n\t\n#2 DIRECTOR GEORGE CLOONEY ORDERS A BIG HACK ATTACK\n\nThus far, George Clooney’s career as a director has yielded three Fresh films (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Good Luck and Good Night, and The Ides of March), and two Rotten films (Leathernecks and The Monuments Men). For movie #6, Clooney has settled upon an adaptation of the Nick Davies non-fiction book Hack Attack. The book details the events of the phone hacking scandal in the U.K. involving various elements of Rupert Murdoch’s British newspaper empire. George Clooney and partner Grant Heslov will produce Hack Attack for Sony Pictures. Talking about the project, Clooney said, “This has all the elements — lying, corruption, blackmail — at the highest levels of government by the biggest newspaper in London. And the fact that it’s true is the best part. Nick is a brave and stubborn reporter and we consider it an honor to put his book to film.”\n\n\n\t\n#3 MAMA DIRECTOR TO ADAPT VIDEO GAME SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS\n\nThe world is still waiting for video game adaptations to experience a golden era comparable to what comic book superheroes enjoy right now, but we continue to hear about steps in the right direction. This week, Sony Pictures announced who the director of their long-planned adaptation of the 2005 PS2 game Shadow of the Colossus will be. That job is going to Argentinean director Andres Muschietti, who made his feature film debut last year with the supernatural horror film Mama. Muschietti will be working with screenwriter Seth Lochhead, who cowrote Hanna. Shadow of the Colossus is a fantasy romance adventure about a man named Wander who must search for a series of massive giant monsters as part of a quest to revive the girl he loves. Other video game adaptations currently planned for the next few years include Assassin’s Creed, Hitman: Agent 47, Pixels (featuring various arcade game characters) and Ratchet &amp; Clank in 2015; and Angry Birds, Sly Cooper, Uncharted, and Warcraft in 2016.\n\n\n\t\n#4 JULIA ROBERTS, CHIWETEL EJIOFOR, AND GWYNETH PALTROW SEE THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES\n\nSpeaking of Argentina, that nation’s film industry in 2009 produced the film that won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, called El Secreto de sus Ojos (The Secret in Their Eyes). Rather than giving such a respected movie something like a wide release so that people can see it for themselves, Hollywood’s reaction of course is to develop an English language remake. This week at the Toronto International Film Festival, the news broke that the cast for the spy thriller is coming together. Julia Roberts is in talks to join the already cast Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) and Gwyneth Paltrow. The remake, which will also be called Secret in their Eyes, was written and will be directed by Billy Ray, whose directing credits include Breach and Shattered Glass, and whose writing credits include Captain Phillips and The Hunger Games. The casting of Julia Roberts represents at least one major change from the original film, as the character’s gender was male. Chiwetel Ejiofor will star as a former MI5 agent who helps the FBI investigate the murder of a friend’s (Roberts) daughter. Roberts and Gwyneth Paltrow previously costarred together (very briefly) in the 1991 movie Hook, which we really only mention so we can link to this, which also made the (TV) news this week.\n\n\n\t\n#5 JESSICA CHASTAIN AND KRISTEN WIIG MAY JOIN MATT DAMON IN THE MARTIAN\n\nWhen we first heard about a movie called The Martian about an astronaut stranded on the 4th planet, there was a lot of skepticism that it was a hastily planned reaction to the success of Gravity (even with Ridley Scott attached to direct). Even if that is what The Martian started as (in addition to being based upon an e-book by Andy Weir), the casting is starting to swing the vibe back into more optimistic territory. First, there was Matt Damon as the title character, and this week, we learned about two female costars. Jessica Chastain is now in talks for what is being described as the “female lead,” and Kristen Wiig is also in talks for a supporting role. Those two additions, plus a script adapted by Drew Goddard (Cloverfield; cowriter of Cabin in the Woods, World War Z) help to tip The Martian back into Fresh territory. Ridley Scott is expected to make The Martian his next film after the Moses movie Exodus: Gods and Kings, before moving on to the sequels to Prometheus and Blade Runner. 20th Century Fox has scheduled The Martian for November 25, 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#6 VINCE VAUGHN GOES ON THE RUN AS THE POLITICIAN\n\nVince Vaughn has signed with Columbia Pictures to star in a comedy called The Politician, about a governor who has to go on the run after a prostitution scandal. The governor is joined by an underling as the two are chased by the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and drug dealers. The Politician will be directed by Michael Dowse, whose recent critical successes have included What If, Goon, and Fubar: Balls to the Wall. The script by newcomers Matthew Bass and Theodore Bressman was also on the 2013 Black List of Unproduced Scripts, which led to Columbia winning a bidding war.\n\n\n\nRotten Idea of the Week\n\t\n#3 A JOKE FROM NEIGHBORS COMES TO LIFE: THE ZAC EFRON/ROBERT DE NIRO ROAD MOVIE\n\nEven people who never actually saw Neighbors earlier this year know that it’s that one movie where Zac Efron dresses up as Robert De Niro from Taxi Driver (along with other De Niros). One has got to wonder if that homage of sorts wasn’t at least part of how this week’s news first got started rolling. Zac Efron and Robert De Niro are now attached to star in a road trip comedy called Driving Dick Kelly (formerly titled Dirty Grandpa). Dan Mazer (I Give It a Year) will direct the comedy from a script by John Phillips, a currently unproduced screenwriter who worked on the still-planned Bad Santa 2. Robert De Niro will play a “lascivious, recently widowed Army veteran who tricks his uptight grandson (Efron) into escorting him to Florida” for Spring Break. Previous actors who were considered for the title role included Jeff Bridges and Michael Douglas. The RT Tomatometer scores suggest a Rotten score, but we’re going to nudge this closer to “Borderline” just because of the implied connection to Neighbors.\n\n\n\t\n#2 JUSTICE LEAGUE MEMBER SHAZAM NOT TO BE IN JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVIES\n\nAfter months of hints and teases, it was officially confirmed this week that Dwayne Johnson will be starring in the DC Comics movie Shazam as the hero’s arch enemy Black Adam, but that news was overshadowed a bit in social media by reactions to some other revelations. In a nutshell, it turns out that Shazam will be handled by Warner Bros subsidiary New Line Cinema, and will not be included in the larger DC Comics cinematic universe. On the one hand, that means that the Shazam movie will “have a tone unto itself” with “a sense of fun and a sense of humor” (that makes total sense for Shazam, but the implication there is that the other DC movies are *not* about fun and humor). New Line Cinema president Toby Emmerich specified, “It’s a DC comic, but it’s not a Justice League character, and it’s not a Marvel comic. The tone and the feeling of the movie will be different from the other range of comic book movies.” And right in there is something especially confusing. It is true that Shazam (AKA Captain Marvel) didn’t join DC Comics until the 1970s (and how that happened is a long story), but since then, the character has indeed been a Justice League character. Captain Marvel was on this famous cover, was a major player in the Kingdom Come Elseworlds, and most recently, Aquaman’s place in the team was taken by Shazam in the Justice League: War animated movie. We’re calling this a “Rotten Idea” because this seems like a huge missed opportunity. Warner Bros and DC Comics have a chance to have the completely inclusive cinematic universe that Marvel can’t have (with three of their biggest properties at other studios), and yet, they’re still voluntarily breaking up their DC Comics characters into separate cinematic worlds.  In related news, it was also noticed this week that Warner Bros has registered four domains which hint that the movies after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will be: Aquaman, Justice League, Shazam, and Wonder Woman (not necessarily in that order). The Shazam screenplay is being adapted by Darren Lemke, whose credits include Turbo, Jack the Giant Slayer, and Shrek Forever After.\n\n\n\t\n#1 DAX SHEPARD TO WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORM OF C.H.i.P.s\n\nThe idea of a C.H.i.P.s movie has been in development in Hollywood for several years now, including a period, back around when That 70s Show was still on the air, when Wilmer Valderrama was attached to be the “new Ponch.” One has to wonder if the success of the two 21 Jump Street movies didn’t at least help this week’s news happen. Warner Bros is now back in development on an adaptation of the 1977-1983 hit TV show C.H.i.P.s, about two members of the California Highway Patrol. This revitalized project will be written and directed by Dax Shepard, who will also star in C.H.i.P.s as Officer Jon Baker. Michael Pena is also attached to costar as Jon’s partner, Frank “Ponch” Poncherello. Larry Wilcox and Erik Estrada, the original stars of the show, may have cameo roles in the new movie, because… well, that just happens a lot with these movies. We’re calling C.H.i.P.s the Rotten Idea of the Week because of Dax Shepard’s Tomatometer, which is mostly Rotten with only three Fresh scores (Zathura, Idiocracy, and Baby Mama), none of which he directed or wrote, not to mention his two directorial efforts (Brother’s Keeper and Hit &amp; Run), which received Tomatometer scores of 0% and 49%, respectively.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"ratings, frames","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Live-Action-Ghost-in-the-Shell-Finds-Its-Lead-Actress"},{"id":"47509202762251","title":"Weekly Ketchup: R.I.P.

Movies that still made the news this week included Aquaman, Bad Boys 3, Ben-Hur, Betty Boop, Inhumans, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nR.I.P. ROBIN WILLIAMS AND LAUREN BACALL \n\nThis week, the whole world experienced a celebrity death that quickly inspired a social media sensation:  Robin Williams died at his home in Marin County of what was later reported to be self-inflicted asphyxiation.  Sadly coincidentally, the death of Robin Williams was one of the saddest celebrity deaths since Heath Ledger died in 2008 before the release of The Dark Knight, playing The Joker, a role which director Christopher Nolan had previously considered giving to his Insomnia star… Robin Williams.  Robin Williams’ career started with the hit ABC comedy Mork and Mindy, which was followed by a movie career that included both comedies (Aladdin, Mrs. Doubtfire, The Birdcage), dramas (Dead Poets Society, Awakenings, Good Will Hunting), and films which were sort of inbetween (The World According to Garp, Good Morning, Vietnam, The Fisher King).  Robin Williams left us with four films that are still on their way: Merry Friggin’ Christmas (11/7/14), Night at the Museum 3: Secret of the Tomb (12/19/14), the drama Boulevard, and Absolutely Anything, in which Williams provides the voice of Simon Pegg’s character’s dog.  In what was probably the week’s most obvious movie news, Variety quickly announced that plans for Mrs. Doubtfire 2 are, pun possibly not intended, “in doubt.”  The social networking juggernaut that resulted from the passing of Robin Williams was given even deeper resonance by the passing, soon after, of Lauren Bacall, who died on Tuesday at the age of 89, to decidedly fewer online memorials.  Married first to Humphrey Bogart (until his death in 1957), and then to Jason Robards, Lauren Bacall’s career spanned some dozens of movies (like To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep, Key Largo, and The Shootist), a Golden Globe, an Academy Award nomination, and an honorary Academy Award.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 TOM HIDDLESTON: FROM MARVEL’S LOKI TO… BEN-HUR?\n\nEvery once in a while with movies with premises that seem fairly obviously “rotten,” this writer has to change everything when a move is made that runs counter to that.  For example, MGM and Paramount have been developing, for a while now, a reboot of the classic Biblical epic Ben-Hur, from Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter).  There have been multiple adaptations of Ben-Hur for both film and TV, all based upon the 1880 novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, by Lew Wallace.  The 1959 version featured Charlton Heston in the lead role, and won a then-record number (11!) of Academy Awards (which was later tied by Titanic and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King).  The surprising news this week that is changing opinions about this reboot is that it is British actor Tom Hiddleston who is now in talks to take the starring role.  With his appearances as Loki in not only Marvel’s movies, but also at San Diego Comic Con, in costume, as Loki, Tom Hiddleston has arguably become one of Marvel’s most reliable stars.  MGM and Paramount have scheduled this latest version of Ben-Hur for February 26, 2016, making it currently the only movie scheduled for the last half of that month.  Tom Hiddleston’s next films include Guillermo del Toro’s ghost movie Crimson Peak, and the 1970s-set period film High Rise.\n\n\n\t\n#2 WILL MARVEL’S INHUMANS LEAVE VIN DIESEL SPEECHLESS?\n\nStarting in 2017, it appears that Marvel Studios will be releasing three movies a year.  We know that Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is scheduled for July 28, 2017, but we don’t know what films will be released on May 5, 2017 or November 3, 2017.  Vin Diesel is helping get a pretty good idea what one of those films will be.  It all started when Vin Diesel posted on his Facebook page, “I get the strange feeling that Marvel thinks I’m Inhuman… Haha.”  The key letter there is the capital “I,” because one of Marvel’s family of superheroes (literally) are the Inhumans, who were first introduced in the 1960s.  This was followed a few days later by a report that one of the other scripts to come out of the same Marvel writers program that started Guardians of the Galaxy was… Inhumans (by newcomer Joe Robert Cole).  There are several threads that seem to suggest Inhumans is indeed on Marvel’s short list.  First off, it helps to know that the “Inhumans” are a secret race of powered individuals who are descended from genetic experiments done on relatives of humans thousands of years ago by Kree scientists.  Yes, that’s right, the Kree, as in the alien race seen in Guardians of the Galaxy.  In fact, in the comics, the leader of the Inhumans, called Black Bolt, becomes the ruler of the Kree Empire, and his sister Crystal marries Ronan the Accuser (who is her second husband after Quicksilver, who will be in next year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron).  Director James Gunn also came out this week and said that Peter Quill’s father won’t be the same person that it was in the comics, which has led people to start guessing, and one possibility is Black Bolt.  Black Bolt is the king of the Inhumans, but his super power is that his voice is so powerful that he must live his life being almost entirely mute, and that… brings us back to Vin Diesel.  Although Vin Diesel costarred in Guardians of the Galaxy as the voice of Groot, he hasn’t yet actually “appeared” in a Marvel movie, but if he played Black Bolt, he could do that, but without having to talk much (and when Black Bolt does open his mouth, there’s usually explosions and continents cracking).  Because the Inhumans have connections to both the Kree Empire and the planet Earth, it’s possible they could be teased or introduced in Avengers: Age of Ultron or Guardians of the Galaxy 2 before eventually appearing in their own movie in 2017.\n\n\n\t\n#3 SANSA FROM GAME OF THRONES AS THE TITLE CHARACTER IN MARY SHELLEY’S MONSTER \n\nTwo weeks ago, Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark in Game of Thrones, appeared in the Weekly Ketchup because of reports that she might star in the movie version of The Last of Us.  This week, the Stark daughter actress who made the news was Sophie Turner, the redhead English actress who plays the perpetually put-upon Sansa Stark on the show.  Sophie Turner has been cast in the lead role in Mary Shelley’s Monster, playing the early 19th century Romantic author and wife to Percy Bysshe Shelley, who will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse, The Railway Man).  This film about the author of Frankenstein comes from writer Deborah Baxtrom, who wrote/directed/produced/edited the British comedy TV series Living with Frankenstein, about the Shelleys, Lord Byron, and Frankenstein’s Monster living together in modern Los Angeles, 180 years later.  In Mary Shelley’s Monster, Sophie Turner will play the writer as someone who is ” drawn into a Faustian bargain with her own ?monster? of an alter ego, who offers literary fame at a desperate personal cost.”  Meanwhile, there’s also 20th Century Fox’s Frankenstein, featuring James McAvoy and Frankenstein, and Daniel Radcliffe as his assistant Igor, which is scheduled for release on October 2, 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#4 THIS WEEK IN RELEASE DATES: GODZILLA 2, THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E., POWER RANGERS, OTHERS \n\nThere’s new release dates announced every week of the year, but the last few weeks have seen dates for more high profile films than is usual.  The “biggest” movie in this latest batch is Godzilla 2 (or whatever it’s eventually called), which Warner Bros has now set for release on June 8, 2018.  Some of this release date news is due to changes in the calendar, such as move of titles away from October of 2014, like Kingsman: The Secret Service (now on 2/13/15) and the North Korea-set comedy The Interview (now on 12/25/14).  One of the movies that is now scheduled for October instead is the Brad Pitt-starring World War II tank action movie Fury, which was moved up a month from 11/14/14 to October 17, 2014.  Another war movie to get a 2014 release date this week was Clint Eastwood’s American Sniper, based on the true story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, which is now scheduled for December 25, 2014.  Another recent event that seems to be impacting release decisions is the success of Guardians of the Galaxy and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with dates in August (or in late summer, in general).  The most obvious example of this is Warner Bros’ adaptation of the TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which was bumped back several months from this coming January until August 14, 2015.  Additions to late July (in two different years) came in the form of Sony’s video game comedy Pixels moving from May 15, 2015 to July 24, 2015, and Lionsgate scheduling the TV show adaptation Power Rangers for July 22, 2016.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#5 SIMON COWELL PRODUCING BETTY BOOP MOVIE\n\nNow that The X Factor has been cancelled by FOX, TV producer Simon Cowell appears to have more time on his hands, as possibly evidenced by this week’s news.  Simon Cowell’s Syco Entertainment is uniting with animation studio Animal Logic Entertainment (Happy Feet, The LEGO Movie) for an adaptation of the classic cartoon character Betty Boop.  First introduced by cartoonist Max Fleischer in 1930, it was in 1932 that Betty Boop first started starring in her own animated shorts, which continued throughout the 1930s.  In addition to various attempts at repopularizing the character in other media, Betty Boop has also appeared in advertisements, including the United Football League, and Hypnose Star Mascara from the Lancome makeup company.  This new Betty Boop movie produced by Simon Cowell is being described as a “a hybrid animated comedy feature that’s driven by music.”  In addition to the American Idol and America’s Got Talent TV shows, Simon Cowell also has the musical movie One Chance (itself inspired by a true story from Britain’s Got Talent) coming soon.\n\n\n\t\n#4 AQUAMAN SOLO MOVIE IN THE WORKS (PROBABLY STARRING JASON MOMOA)\n\nAnother comic book royal that was in the news quite a bit this week is King Orin of Atlantis, AKA Aquaman.  The week started on Friday (but the news broke after the Weekly Ketchup “went to press”, so to speak).  While filming Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in Detroit, director Zack Snyder heard some local radio personalities joking about Aquaman.  By now, we’re sort of used to any sort of humor being associated with DC superhero movies, but the memo apparently hadn’t been sent to Detroit morning zoo crews.  So, to defend Aquaman, Zack Snyder called the radio station, and sort of went crazy with the comic book minutiae dropping.  This included the revelation that Aquaman could “cut the flesh of Superman if they came in contact,” which we can probably interpret as meaning that there will totally be a scene where Aquaman cuts Superman in the movie.  Hopefully, Superman won’t break Aquaman’s neck in response.  One clue that he won’t be doing that is that Warner Bros this week hired two different screenwriters to work on Aquaman solo movies.  It’s not particularly common, but “dual track” screenplays allow for studios to potentially develop a script faster.  It’s also a practice that some professional writers find questionable.  Anyway, the two writers who are competing with each other, all reality TV-style, are Will Beall (Gangster Squad) and Kurt Johnstad (Act of Valor), who was also one of Zach Snyder’s cowriters on 300 and the sequel 300: Rise of an Empire.  Of those four movies, only 300 scored higher than 42% on the RT Tomatometer.\n\n\n\t\n#3 JOURNEY FRANCHISE GETTING TWO SEQUELS FROM WRITERS OF HOUSE OF WAX AND WHITEOUT\n\nNew Line Cinema confirmed this week plans to continue making sequels to the franchise that started with Journey to the Center of the Earth and 2012’s Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.  Although the second movie seemed to end with fairly concrete evidence that a third movie would be based upon From Earth to the Moon, it is now being said that the third and fourth movies might go to completely different settings.  Journey to the Center of the Earth, The Mysterious Island, and From Earth to the Moon were all books by 19th century French science fiction author Jules Verne.  New Line Cinema has hired screenwriting team of brothers Chad and Corey Hayes, whose filmography includes such “Rotten” titles as House of Wax (25%), The Reaping (8%), and Whiteout (7%), although their 2013 movie The Conjuring did get good reviews (86% “Fresh”).  Instead of just a third movie, New Line Cinema appears to be considering greenlighting a fourth film as well, with #3 and #4 possibly being filmed back-to-back.  Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is signed to reprise his role from Journey 2: The Mysterious Island in both films.\n\n\n\t\n#2 MARTIN LAWRENCE DISPLAYS HORRIBLE SENSE OF TIMING WITH BAD BOYS 3 ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nWhile the rest of the country is in shock and dismay over the events in Ferguson, MO, Martin Lawrence decided it would be a great time to go on national television and talk about doing another Bad Boys movie.  (20th Century Fox also released Let’s Be Cops on Wednesday, but they really couldn’t have pulled the movie from theaters two days before release.)  Actually, that’s just a quibble about the timing of Martin Lawrence’s appearance on Conan (which was seen by people hoping to see Conan’s tribute to Robin Williams).  This story would be “rotten” regardless, following the 23% “Rotten” scores that Bad Boys II earned back in 2003.  The idea of a third Bad Boys movie has been floating around since 2003, but the last we heard much about it was in 2010.  Martin Lawrence’s update went like this, “I just talked to Jerry Bruckheimer… yesterday and he said its real. They?re working on the script, they?re getting close and it all looks good.” It was Conan O’Brien who technically asked about Bad Boys III, but the questions on late night talk shows are usually discussed ahead of time.\n\n\n\t\n#1 TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES GETS 2016 SEQUEL… WHICH MIGHT FEATURE KRANG\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles opened this past weekend to over $65 million (the 10th largest of 2014 so far).  Not surprisingly, Paramount Pictures had already by Sunday afternoon announced plans to release a sequel to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on June 3, 2016.  Michael Bay will also produce the sequel, but it’s not yet known if director Jonathan Liebesman, who also directed such “Rotten” films  as Battle: Los Angeles, Darkness Falls, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning will be returning to help ensure Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 also gets horrible reviews.  Having said that, it certainly sounds like Liebesman thinks he’s returning for the sequel, because he’s already talking about plans that might include expanding the movies to “Dimension X” for the first time, which is where cartoon villain Krang comes from.  Speaking of big brained mutates who get around in metal forms, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 may end up playing catch up in 2016.  The reason for this is that screenwriter Christopher Markus, who is currently working on Captain America 3, revealed this week that it’s his hope that they will be able to include M.O.D.O.K. in the sequel, and that movie, as is much publicisized already, will be released on May 6, 2016, less than a month before Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2.  And as big as Krang’s head is, he’s no M.O.D.O.K.  Krang was first introduced in 1987, and M.O.D.O.K. was first introduced in 1967, twenty years earlier.  When he’s inside his robot body, Krang also resembles the comic book version of Arnim Zola, who also appeared in the first two Captain America movies.  The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles themselves also first started as spoofs of Marvel’s Daredevil (Stick and the Hand became Splinter and the Foot, and they all share radioactive goo-nealogy).\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Hulu, period, Red, streaming, historical, Disney, independent, Now, camera, the, BBC, Family","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-RIP-Robin-Williams-and-Lauren-Bacall"},{"id":"47509202749955","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Lego Batman Gets His Own Movie","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Lego Batman Gets His Own MoviePlus, Marvel rumors, casting news for The Hateful Eight and James Bond 24, and a Robin Hood cinematic universe.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 10, 2014 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes ten top film development news stories about such projects as James Bond 24, LEGO Batman, Little House on the Prairie, The Purge 3, and new roles for Steve Carell and Bryan Cranston.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryTHE VERY, VERY DARK GREY KNIGHT RETURNS: LEGO BATMAN GETS A MOVIEOne of the secret weapons snuggled into the middle of one of 2014’s earliest box office successes, The LEGO Movie, was a depiction of Batman (and other DC superheroes) that harkened back to earlier, less serious depictions. This was appropriate, of course, given that The LEGO Movie was ostensibly a “kids movie,” and not a “grim and gritty” movie (although the movie also gently ribbed Batman about that.) We’ve known for a while that Warner Bros was planning for both a direct sequel to The LEGO Movie, as well as a LEGO Ninjago movie (for September 23, 2016). This week, however, it was learned that Warner Bros now has put a LEGO Batman movie on a fast track for a release in 2017. This Bat-centric LEGO movie might possibly take the May 26 date previously slotted for The Lego Movie 2, with that movie being pushed back to a later date. Will Arnett, who voiced Batman in The LEGO Movie, will return to voice Batman in this spinoff. No story details have been specified yet, but there are already three LEGO Batman video games, as well as an animated movie for Cartoon Network in 2008, so there’s plenty of source material to utilize for LEGO Batman’s feature film solo debut. The LEGO Batman movie will be directed by Chris McKay, the animation supervisor on The LEGO Movie, from a script by Seth Grahame-Smith, author of the horror mashup novels Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Pride &amp; Prejudice &amp; Zombies.Fresh Developments This Week#1 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL RUMORS: IRON MAN 4, AVENGERS 3, AND… SPIDER-MAN?This could easily have seemed like a big week for Marvel news, if one’s definition of “news” includes rumors and speculation. Having said that, take pretty much everything that follows (except for the Ant-Man news) with a figurative grain of salt. First up, you may have heard that Robert Downey Jr. went on Ellen Degeneres’ TV show (to promote The Judge), and “confirmed” that there will be an Iron Man 4. What made less people’s news feeds was the confirmation a few hours later on David Letterman’s show that, well, “There’s no plans for an Iron Man 4.” Whether there will or won’t be a fourth solo film for Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man, it seems fairly certain that he will continue to appear as Iron Man in (other) Marvel movies (at least for a while). That leads us to another hot rumor this week, which concerns who will or won’t be appearing in The Avengers 3, which might be released in 2018. With RDJ, Chris Evans, and Chris Hemsworth each only having one to two movies left on their contracts, there are now rumors that the solution to this will be for The Avengers 3 to leave out pretty much every current member of the team except Iron Man, possibly joined by the various new characters introduced in “Phase 3” (Ant-Man, Doctor Strange, and possibly Captain Marvel). The rumor really gets wild after that, conjecturing that this would then lead to a big event movie that ties every element of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including Guardians of the Galaxy, and the various ABC and Netflix TV shows. And that leads us to the next hot rumor this week, which is that there might be negotiations going on between Sony and Marvel that would lead to The Amazing Spider-Man connecting with Marvel’s Cinematic Universe. Now, would that actually lead to Spider-Man appearing in an Avengers movie, or would it just be a loosening of the definitions of which characters can or cannot appear in each studio’s movies? We don’t know what we don’t know. After all of that, the only “real” confirmed Marvel news this week is that Martin Donovan (of Showtime’s Weeds and Homeland) has been cast in next year’s Ant-Man, joining the already cast Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, John Slattery, and Corey Stoll.&nbsp;#2 JENNIFER JASON LEIGH LANDS LEAD IN QUENTIN TARANTINO’S THE HATEFUL EIGHTQuentin Tarantino is preparing to start filming the western drama The Hateful Eight, and this week, we learned who finally landed the female lead role, along with the rest of the cast. Jennifer Jason Leigh (Rush, Dolores Claiborne) will play the prisoner Daisy Domergue, who is on her way to being hung for her crimes while a sheriff’s party camps in Wyoming waiting for a storm to pass. Other cast members will include Tarantino veterans Samuel L. Jackson, Zoe Bell, Bruce Dern, Walton Goggins, Michael Madsen, Denis Menochet, Tim Roth, and Kurt Russell. Quentin Tarantino’s search for his Daisy Domergue has lasted for several months now, and the actresses who have been in the running have reportedly included Demi Moore, Hilary Swank, Amber Tamblyn, Michelle Williams, and Robin Wright.&nbsp;#3 HEISENBERG RETURNS TO THE CARTEL: BRYAN CRANSTON IS… THE INFILTRATORAfter reinventing himself as the iconic Walter White in AMC’s Breaking Bad, the question was always going to linger out there: would Bryan Cranston ever return to anything close like the same subject? We learned this answer this week, as Bryan Cranston has joined the thriller The Infiltrator, based upon an autobiography of the same name by Robert Mazur. Under the cover name of “Bob Musella,” federal agent Robert Mazur invited members of the notorious Colombian cocaine cartel (and their bankers) to a wedding to spring a trap of arrests upon all involved. The Infiltrator will be directed by Brad Furman, whose most successful film was 2011’s The Lincoln Lawyer (which was followed by the not-as-successful 2013 film Runner Runner). Other films that Bryan Cranston has in the works include Kung Fu Panda 3, and the Hollywood black list true story Trumbo.&nbsp;#4 NEW BOND GIRL: BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR STAR LEA SEYDOUXFrench actress Lea Seydoux, who is best known for starring in Blue is the Warmest Color (she was also in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol), has reportedly landed a role in the still-untitled 24th James Bond movie. Seydoux joins a cast that already includes Daniel Craig (obviously), Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, and Naomie Harris (the other “Bond Girl” we know about for this movie). Skyfall director Sam Mendes is returning for this film, which is already scheduled for release on November 6, 2015.&nbsp;#5 LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE: MARY, LAURA, CARRIE, GRACE, MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE?For as long as we’ve known that there were plans to make a new movie based upon Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie (based on her own childhood), it’s been known that the 19th century drama was going to have something of an “indie movie” vibe. That notion came because the initial director attached to the project was David Gordon Green, whose filmography includes George Washington, All the Real Girls, Undertow, and Snow Angels. David Gordon Green has since departed Little House on the Prairie, and this week, we found out who will be replacing him, and it’s another “indie” director. Sean Durkin made his feature film directorial debut in 2011 with Martha Marcy May Marlene, and although that movie was female-centric and set in the wilderness… yeah, it’s nothing like Little House on the Prairie, or at least, as we’ve seen that story adapted before. Maybe the new Little House on the Prairie will have a new subplot about a brainwashing personality cult (but hopefully not). In addition to being a novel (and part of a larger series of books), Little House on the Prairie was also a popular 1970s-1980s TV series on NBC starring Michael Landon and Melissa Gilbert.&nbsp;#6 LUKE WILSON TO PLAY NFL COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELLContinuing right along, this was indeed a big week for roles inspired by real life figures. One of the faces that appeared in the news a lot this year was NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, and in 2015, we’ll see a movie with someone else’s face as Goodell. Luke Wilson (Old School, The Royal Tenenbaums) is now in talks to join the cast of the still-untitled Ridley Scott-produced “NFL concussion” drama starring Will Smith. In addition to Will Smith, the cast will also include Alec Baldwin, Albert Brooks, Arliss Howard, David Morse, Gugu Mbatha Raw, and Paul Reiser. Peter Landesman, who as a screenwriter worked on this week’s Kill the Messenger, will direct this drama after making his directorial debut on 2013’s Parkland. Casey Affleck also made “true story” news this week by signing on to produce and star in Boston Strong, about the “epic manhunt” following the April, 2013 Boston marathon bombing. Boston Strong was adapted by screenwriters Eric Johnson and Paul Tamasy, who previously worked together on The Fighter (also about Boston), from the book of the same title by Casey Sherman and Dave Wedge. The director of Boston Strong hasn’t been announced (or possibly even hired) yet.Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 STEVE CARELL TO STAR IN PARANOIA THRILLERThe long list of green splotches on RT Tomatometers like Michael Bay’s are so epic and huge that it’s easy to forget that there are other “big” studio directors whose filmographies also sport lots of Rotten scores. Take, for example, Gore Verbinski. When he’s got a new movie out, the trailer might trumpet the fact that he directed The Ring, Rango, and of course, the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie (as well as the two Rotten sequels that followed it). What those trailers are less likely to mention is that Verbinski also directed Mouse Hunt, The Mexican, The Weather Man, and last year’s notorious dud The Lone Ranger. Well, maybe Steve Carell can help Verbinski turn things around. The star of this week’s Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day has signed on to star in an untitled “paranoid thriller” to be directed by Gore Verbinski. That’s pretty much all we know about this project, except that we can also tell you that it was written by Steve Conrad, whose filmography includes Wrestling Ernest Hemingway, The Pursuit of Happyness, last year’s The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, and… The Weather Man.&nbsp;#2 THE PURGE 3 TO CONTINUE NEW ANNUAL TRADITION, IN THE SPIRIT OF SAW AND PARANORMAL ACTIVITYThe thing about horror franchises is that because they can be produced relatively inexpensively, and turned around faster than say, big superhero movies, they easily lend themselves to being annual fixtures on studio schedules (until they really start to underperform). In the past, we’ve seen this done (if not always annually, at least quasi-annually) with Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Final Destination, Saw, and Paranormal Activity. With two hits under the franchise’s belt, one of the newer entries into this category appears to be Universal’s The Purge. The Purge: Anarchy may have a Rotten score, but the movie also earned almost $110 million. So, yes, of course, there’s going to be The Purge 3 (or whatever they end up calling it). The third movie will be directed by the same director (James DeMonaco) as The Purge: Anarchy. Universal hasn’t given The Purge 3 a release date in 2015… yet.&nbsp;#1 SONY ATTEMPTING TO CREATE A CINEMATIC UNIVERSE AROUND… ROBIN HOOD?Ever since Marvel Studios started proving that this “cinematic universe” idea was really working for them, we’ve heard about other studios considering the same approach for their own concepts. Examples of this include Universal Pictures’ monsters (starting this week with Dracula Untold), Sony’s plans for Amazing Spider-Man spin offs, Warner Bros’ DC Comics adaptations (starting with Man of Steel) and that studio’s six-movie plans for a new King Arthur franchise. If Sony Pictures sees their plans through, we can also add to that list a new series of movies set in medieval England that will start with a movie called Hood. As you might guess from the title, this potential “franchise” will feature Robin Hood and his band of “Merry Men,” some of whom, like Friar Tuck, Little John, and Will Scarlett, would then go on to star in their own movies. Of course, the big difference between this plan and what Marvel did is that Hood would be the “team movie” before the individual characters get their own movies (Marvel did the opposite leading up to The Avengers). For example, if you were listening to the 1974 playlist on Spotify when you were making deals for your studio, you start with The Jailer Man, Sailor Sam, and The County Judge Who Held a Grudge, and THEN, you get them all together for Band on the Run. Anyway, the tone of Hood is being compared to Mission: Impossible and the Fast &amp; Furious movies (because studio publicists never compare their projects to franchises that weren’t successful).For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"spanish, series, monster, X-Men, Video, in, Starz, Heroines, TV, saw, children's, Marathons, festivals","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-lego-batman-gets-his-own-movie"},{"id":"47509202758153","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Martin Scorsese Plans a Ramones Biopic","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Martin Scorsese Plans a Ramones Biopic\n                        Plus, casting news for Matthew McConaughey, Joaquin Phoenix, and Steve Carell, and an Underworld reboot.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 29, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup, coming to you just before the Labor Day weekend, covers what was admittedly sort of a slow week in movie development news. Included in the mix are stories involving Steve Carell, Matthew McConaughey and Joaquin Phoenix, and the James Bond, King Arthur, Underworld, and Alvin and the Chipmunks franchises.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nHEY, HO, LET’S GO: MARTIN SCORSESE TO DIRECT THE RAMONES\n\nMartin Scorsese has been trying to make a musical biopic for most of his career as a famous film director. These attempts have included in the past both Dean Martin, and more recently, Frank Sinatra. Those two would seem an obvious fit for the director of such movies as Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and (especially) Casino, but this week we found out that the eventual winner in the Martin Scorsese musical biopic search might be as different from Martin and Sinatra as 20th century musicians could get.  Martin Scorsese is now planning on someday directing a movie about The Ramones.  The Ramones started out as a 1970s hard rock group that blended 1960s-style garage band pop melodies with a fascination with pop culture and “outsider” sensibilities (and yet, they all took the same last name). There were eight Ramones over the year, but the core group was Joey (died in 2001), Dee Dee (2002), Johnny (2004), and Tommy (2014). The year 2016 will be the 40th anniversary of the Ramones’ first album, so one has to wonder if the timing isn’t sort of perfect for Scorsese’s The Ramones to also come out in that year. Standing in the way, however, is the fact that there’s currently no screenwriter attached to adapt The Ramones, and Martin Scorsese is himself preparing to direct a different film, the “missionaries in Japan” drama Silence. Adam Driver, Andrew Garfield, Liam Neeson, and Ken Watanabe will star in Silence, which is currently expected to be released in late 2015.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 MIGHT MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY BE WALKIN’ DUDE RANDALL FLAGG IN THE STAND?\n\nMonday night’s Emmys broadcast made a big point of celebrating the fact that Matthew McConaughey was there, as a nominee for True Detective. McConaughey didn’t actually win (Bryan Cranston did, for Breaking Bad), but it didn’t seem to hurt his career, if a new report about Warner Bros is correct.  The studio is reportedly eyeing Matthew McConaughey for two different roles, including one in their adaptation of Stephen King’s The Stand, to be directed by Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars).  Reportedly, Warner Bros hopes to recruit Matthew McConaughey to play Randall Flagg, the villain in King’s post-apocalyptic American epic about the final battle between the forces of evil and good, metaphorically represented as Las Vegas and Boulder, Colorado.  In addition to being the villain in The Stand, Randall Flagg also appeared in other Stephen King books like The Eyes of the Dragon, and the various entries in the series The Dark Tower.  Warner Bros is also considering Matthew McConaughey for Gold, a true story film from screenwriter Stephen Gaghan (Traffic, Syriana), about a 1993 scandal in which a mining company discovered gold in the jungles of Indonesia. McConaughey is not officially in talks with Warner Bros for either The Stand or Gold yet.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THIS WEEK IN DOCTOR STRANGE: JOAQUIN PHOENIX CONFIRMED?\n\nSixteen years after Dianne Wiest costarred in Practical Magic, and nine years after Keanu Reeves starred in Constantine, this week, two more Parenthood stars made the news for movies involving magic. First up, there is Marvel’s Doctor Strange movie, which is expected to be released in 2016, after Captain America 3. The week started with an online rumor that Jack Huston, who’s probably most famous for playing Richard Harrow on HBO’s Boardwalk Empire, was in the running. This was followed by a story at Collider.com asserting that Joaquin Phoenix, who had been mentioned as the front runner last month, is now indeed in “final talks” to star as Doctor Strange. What’s missing thus far (as of this writing on early Friday afternoon) is another source confirming Collider’s story. Doctor Strange will be directed by Scott Derrickson (Sinister, Deliver Us from Evil). Steve Martin, who played Joaquin Phoenix’s uncle in Parenthood, also made the news this week for a movie called Magic Camp. Steve Martin will star in the Disney family comedy as a banker who returns to “Magic Camp” as a counselor to help the kids get ready for the big “Golden Wand” competition. Steve Martin also cowrote Magic Camp, along with A.C.O.D. writer/director Stu Zicherman. All of this Parenthood talk might seem a little strange, but if Martha Plimpton (star of 2005’s Dante’s Inferno) plays a witch someday, you… heard this theory here first. Until then, Parenthood director Ron Howard confirmed this week that he and Tom Hanks will start filming their next movie together in April, which will be an adaptation of Dan Brown’s… Inferno.\n\n\n\t\n#3 WILL JAMES BOND 24 FEATURE A NEW “ICONIC” HENCHMAN?\n\nFor this Weekly Ketchup covering these final days of August before Labor Day, the pickings were slim enough that we’re covering stories more in the “rumor” category than would be the norm in a busier time of the year. An example of that is this story from the James Bond fan site “MI6” about a casting call for a new character to be introduced in “James Bond 24.” The casting call is reportedly looking for someone “extremely” physically fit and tall (over 6′ 2″), with consideration including “former sports athletes” and anyone “very unusual.” The new assassin character is going under the codename “Hinx” (not to be confused with Jinx, the Bond Girl played by Halle Berry), and it’s presumed that the producers are looking for a new “iconic” Bond bad guy to follow in the model of classic villains like Oddjob, Nick Nack, May Day, and Jaws. Skyfall director Sam Mendes will return for James Bond 24, which is scheduled for release in the U.S. on November 6, 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#4 ACTRESS/DIRECTOR LAKE BELL TO DIRECT THE EMPEROR’S WORLD\n\nLast year, actress Lake Bell made her directorial debut with In a World…, set in the “movie trailer narration” business, and the result was a Fresh Tomatometer score of 92%.  Another film that did very well critically last year was Frances Ha, with a 93% Fresh (and two Independent Spirit Awards nominations). Both of those 2013 independent films come together, basically, to form this week’s news. Lake Bell will next direct an adaptation of the Claire Messud novel The Emperor’s Children, which was adapted by Noah Baumbach (who directed and cowrote Frances Ha). The Emperor’s Children was set in “the liberal intellectual elite of New York, telling the tale of three entitled but unsuccessful late twentysomethings who orbit the life of a famous journalist in the months before and after the events of 9/11.” It’s not yet known if Lake Bell will also take a role in the film.\n\n\n\t\n#5 KING ARTHUR TO BE A PACIFIC RIM REUNION PROJECT\n\nWith Legendary Pictures now at Universal, Warner Bros in 2014 is very much in the business of starting new franchises of their own (like Tarzan, J.K. Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts movies, and obviously, the DC Comics franchise). One of those gambles is a new King Arthur franchise, which might end up being a six movie saga, with the first film being directed by Guy Ritchie, who gave Warner Bros their two recent Sherlock Holmes movies, and next year’s The Man from U.N.C.L.E. We’ve known for a while that the “Merlin-like” figure will be played by Idris Elba, but the surprising turn came this week when it was revealed that Arthur will be played by Charlie Hunnam (TV’s Sons of Anarchy). The reason this is surprising is that it effectively makes the King Arthur franchise a reunion for Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnam, who were basically the two male leads in last year’s Pacific Rim. That giant robots/monsters movie will be getting a sequel from director Guillermo del Toro (and Legendary Pictures), but no casting has been officially confirmed yet.  Warner Bros also made the news this week as part of a “rumor” that the studio now has a “no jokes” policy for their upcoming DC Comics adaptations, following the perceived box office failure of Green Lantern (which had lots and lots of jokes).\n\n\n\t\n#6 STEVE CARELL ATTACHED TO STAR IN ACME LOONEY TUNES SPINOFF\n\nSpeaking of Warner Bros’ continued plans to fill in holes in their production schedule, there’s this story. The studio had a big animated movie success with The LEGO Movie, and with both a Ninjago movie and a LEGO sequel on the way, Warner Bros is looking to repeat that success in coming years. Other kid-friendly properties at Warner Bros are the various Looney Tunes characters, including Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.  In recent years, the Weekly Ketchup has covered news stories about Looney Tunes getting a “reboot movie”, and rumors about Space Jam getting a sequel (which may or may not have been correct). Another project that’s been in development for years now is a currently untitled Looney Tunes spinoff about the “ACME” company that provides characters like Wile E. Coyote with the various gadgets that they use in their animated adventures. This week, we found out that Steve Carell is now attached to star in this live-action spinoff. The script was written by the team of Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz (X-Men: First Class), and it might be directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who directed Steve Carell in Crazy Stupid Love.\n\n\n\nRotten Idea of the Week\n\t\n#3 50 SHADES OF GREY STAR TAKES LEAD IN THE 9TH LIFE OF LOUIS DRAX\n\nAs Guardians of the Galaxy again took the #1 box office spot (and ascended past $500 million worldwide), fans might have been disappointed when they clicked the link about a new “Drax” movie.  Jamie Dornan, who took the lead role in next year’s adaptation of 50 Shades of Grey, will star in The 9th Life of Louis Drax, a Miramax psychological thriller to be directed by Alexandre Aja. In addition to Mirrors and the upcoming Horns, Aja directed the remakes of The Hills Have Eyes and Piranha (which was Aja’s only Fresh Tomatometer score). Jamie Dornan will play a doctor who helps a young boy explore the strange circumstances behind a “near fatal fall… testing the boundaries of fantasy and reality.” This adaptation of the novel by Liz Jensen was previously in development as a project for the late director Anthony Minghella (The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley), and the script was adapted by his son, actor Max Minghella (The Social Network, Art School Confidential).\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE VAMPIRES OF UNDERWORLD TO BE RESURRECTED (IN A REBOOT)\n\nThe year 2012 saw the release of Underworld: Awakenings, the fourth film in the Underworld franchise, following the original film in 2003, Underworld: Evolution in 2006, and the prequel Underworld: Rise of the Lycans in 2009.  Kate Beckinsale starred as a vampire in three of those movies, but it’s possible the British actress is done playing Selene. Still, Lakeshore Entertainment is apparently not done making Underworld movies, because the production company is now developing a reboot of the vampire/werewolf action franchise. To that end, Lakeshore has hired screenwriter Cory Goodman, whose previous films have included Priest and Apollo 18. This is one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas” because of the results on this search page.\n\n\n\t\n#1 THE NIGHT THEY CAME HOME: ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS 4\n\nIf you want to feel old, consider that there is a growing chunk of the moviegoing audience who only knows Alvin and the Chipmunks from the three movies released in 2007, 2009, and 2011 (though really, if you have strong memories of them before that, you’ve probably got lots of reasons to feel old). These musical live-action/CGI animation hybrid “comedies” have never been critical hits, and so this week’s Rotten Idea was an easy one to peg. 20th Century Fox is moving forward with plans for Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. The studio has hired screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer, whose credits include 2010’s Tooth Fairy, and the 1993 crossdressing comedy Mrs. Doubtfire, starring the late Robin Williams, which had also been a Fox production (and one that the studio had been a developing a sequel for). Some sources list the title of this fourth movie as Alvin and the Chipmunks: Road Trip, with a release date in 2016..\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"and, Masterpiece, international, Geographic, Turner","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Martin-Scorsese-Plans-a-Ramones-Biopic"},{"id":"47509204489748","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Jason Momoa is DC’s Aquaman","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Jason Momoa is DC's Aquaman\n                        Plus, new roles for Keanu Reeves and Anna Kendrick, and the NWA movie gets its cast.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 20, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes movie development news stories for the almost requisite (these days) superhero movies like Justice League, Doctor Strange, and Ant-Man, as well as new roles for Anna Kendrick, Jared Leto, and Keanu Reeves.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nJASON MOMOA: FROM KHAL DROGO TO… AQUAMAN? \n\nThis Week’s Top Story actually started over six months ago, when Jason Momoa was announced as being in talks to costar in the Batman/Superman movie. At that time, the expectation was that he was playing a villain of some sort, or maybe Martian Manhunter. Lots of guesses were made. What makes movie news from December news now is that it wasn’t until this week that we found out what role Jason Momoa is actually playing (both in that movie and future films, like 2017’s Justice League). First off, keep in mind that we’re talking about the muscular actor who played Khal Drogo on Game of Thrones, and was also starred in the reboot of Conan the Barbarian. Okay, got that in mind? Now picture that guy as Aquaman. Born in Hawaii, Momoa is a well-known surfing enthusiast, so we at least know he likes to be in the water a lot. Lingering in the background as a reason why Warner Bros might want to snag a muscular, brunette, surf-loving actor like Jason Momoa is the rumor that Universal Pictures might be stealth planning on releasing Namor: The Sub-Mariner on November 4, 2016. First published in 1939, Sub-Mariner was a popular comic book character that predated the 1941 introduction of Aquaman  by two years. Both Aquaman and Namor are Atlantean-human hybrid rulers of the underwater Kingdom of Atlantis. One reason Aquaman is more famous 70 years later, is probably because of Super Friends, and other TV shows like Smallville (Sub-Mariner was one of the stars of the short-lived 1966 Marvel Super Heroes animated TV series).  Namor: The Sub-Mariner, like Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, and X-Men, is one of those Marvel characters whose rights are still held by a studio other than Marvel/Disney. In other WB/DC rumors, there was also one this week about Ben Affleck starring in a solo movie called The Batman to be scheduled for 2019 after Affleck wraps his next directorial effort, Live By Night, scheduled for October 7, 2016.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 LOOPER DIRECTOR LANDS STAR WARS EPISODE VIII\n\nLucasfilm and Walt Disney Pictures have been busy of late, landing young “rising star” directors for two of their Star Wars spin off projects (namely, Gareth Edwards and Josh Trank). This week, another such director joined their ranks by landing the job on Star Wars Episode VIII. That writing and directing job, as well as an initial treatment, for Star Wars Episode IX, has gone to Rian Johnson, the director of Looper. Initial reports had Rian Johnson also directing Star Wars Episode IX, but that was quickly debunked (like, within a few minutes). The rather ambitious release schedule appears, for now, to have the “Episode” movies released in Decembers of odd years, and the “spin offs” in Decembers of even years. In other words, Star Wars Episode VIII is scheduled for December of 2017 and Star Wars Episode IX is scheduled for December of 2019. Of course, that’s also six years from now, and things could easily change (a lot) by then.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL PART 1: DOCTOR STRANGE\n\nThis week, there were a few different news items we can string together by their relation to Marvel’s Doctor Strange. First off, there is that film’s director, Scott Derrickson (Sinister, The Exorcism of Emily Rose), who has signed with MGM to cowrite their long-in-development adaptation of the 1960s science fiction anthology TV series The Outer Limits. Derrickson and Sinister cowriter Robert Cargill will be adapting the classic short story “Demon with a Glass Hand” by Harlan Ellison, which was adapted as one of the episodes of the original TV series.  Going back to Doctor Strange directly, we also learned this week that Marvel Studios is negotiating with Prometheus cowriter Jon Spaihts to work on a new draft Doctor Strange, post-Derrickson’s-hiring.  Finally, here’s the most tangentially related of the three, and that’s only because Jared Leto is one of several actors reportedly in the running for the role (along with Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy). Jared Leto is now in talks with Legendary Pictures to star in the science fiction film Brilliance, following the recent departure of Will Smith, who had previously been attached to star in the film. Smith left Brilliance so that he could star in a “NFL concussion” drama for director Ridley Scott, who is also producing Brilliance.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL PART 2: RUMORS SWIRL ABOUT THE ANT-MAN VILLAIN(S)\n\nWhen Edgar Wright departed Marvel’s Ant-Man, and Adam McKay came aboard to write a new draft, one thing that may have changed is the film’s villain. Right now, we don’t know for sure if such a thing did or didn’t happen. But, we do know that this week, there were a couple of different online stories purporting to know details about the Ant-Man villain. The earliest Ant-Man (and Giant-Man) stories featured the introductions of several villains who went on to become fairly classic Marvel villains (like Black Knight, Whirlwind, and the Porcupine… okay, maybe not *that* classic). However, most of them went on to become villains for the Avengers, or other superheroes, and eventually, Ant-Man wasn’t left with much of a rogue’s gallery at all, unless you count Egghead. We already knew that Corey Stoll and Patrick Wilson had been cast in the film in unknown roles, and if this week’s reports are correct, we now know who they will be playing. Reportedly, Stoll has been cast as industrialist Darren Cross, and Patrick Wilson will play his cousin William Cross, who is also known in the comics as the assassin Crossfire. There was also a rumor this week that the “real” villain of Ant-Man will be Yellowjacket, which leads to even more questions, as Yellowjacket was one of the alter-egos of Hank Pym (ie, Michael Douglas) (in particular, Yellowjacket was the costume Hank was wearing when this happened). What complicates things is that Yellowjacket has also been the identity of other characters, so the movie might have a completely different Yellowjacket (like maybe Darren Cross wears the suit, to shrink down and fight Ant-Man on his own level?).\n\n\n\t\n#4 THE CAST OF THE N.W.A. MOVIE STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON IS REVEALED\n\nAnother movie to get more than one news story this week was Universal Pictures’ Straight Outta Compton, the true story of rap group N.W.A. First off, there was the casting of the group’s most famous members, with Marcus Callendar playing Dr. Dre, Jason Mitchell playing Eazy E, and Ice Cube’s son O’Shea Jackson Jr. playing Ice Cube himself. This news was soon followed by the announcement of a release date of August 14, 2015. And that’s the point at which this story gets highjacked by another Universal project, because that was formerly the release date for the fifth Bourne movie, which has now been moved to July 15, 2016. And that led to a new, late-breaking rumor just as we went to press that the movie was held back a year to help entice Matt Damon to return to the franchise.\n\n\n\t\n#5 ANNA KENDRICK TO STAR IN DREAMWORKS ANIMATION’S TROLLS\n\nAnna Kendrick, costar of Pitch Perfect and the upcoming sequel Pitch Perfect 2, has been cast as the lead character in DreamWorks Animation’s adaptation of the long-running doll franchise Trolls (yes, those Trolls). Anna Kendrick will voice “Poppy,” a “relentlessly upbeat princess” who goes off on a wacky adventure to discover the secrets of why trolls have “gravity-defying hair.” Yes, really. Right now is where you ask why this is a Fresh Development.  Well, we’re grouping stories together in a busy week, and the second half of DreamWorks’ week concerned Steven Spielberg.  Namely, that we now know the release dates of his next two films as director: The untitled U2 spy plane drama will be released on October 16, 2015; the children’s book adaptation The BFG will be released on July 1, 2016; and Trolls will be released on November 4, 2016.\n\n\n\t\n#6 KEANU REEVES JOINS COURTROOM DRAMA THE WHOLE TRUTH\n\nThis week, Keanu Reeves replaced Daniel Craig as the star of the courtroom drama The Whole Truth for the director of the indie hit Frozen River, Courtney Hunt. The project was previously scheduled to start filming in April, but Daniel Craig pulled out of the project just four days before the first day of filming. Keanu Reeves joins Renee Zellweger, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and Gabriel Bosso in the story of an attorney fighting to get his teenage client “acquitted of murdering his wealthy father.” There’s a very good chance that the indie producers are hoping to get The Whole Truth wrapped in time for a premiere at Sundance in January of 2015.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 THE FOOSBALL ANIMATED MOVIE UNDERDOGS GETS SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY RELEASE\n\nThis movie actually could have been covered back in March when the Weinstein Company acquired the rights, but at that time, this writer was unsure if the movie would get a theatrical release. Now, we know, and the choice of January 16, 2015 (when a lot of Rotten movies are released) doesn’t instill much more confidence. The movie we’re talking about is the animated foosball comedy Underdogs, which now has a trailer that you can “enjoy.”\n\n\n\t\n#2 THIS WEEK IN SUBMARINES: CAPTAIN NEMO, AND THE DUELING “DRUG SUB” MOVIES\n\nSomething that sometimes happens when much-ballyhooed projects get delayed is that a while later, another studio starts developing their own similar movie. So, now that it looks like David Fincher’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea for Walt Disney Pictures is delated indefinitely, hey, here’s a completely different Captain Nemo movie! This one came to Sony Pictures as a pitch from the team of Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who are best known for their years on TV’s Smallville, but they also worked on such Rotten films as Herbie: Fully Loaded, Hannah Montana: The Movie, and most recently, I Am Number Four. Speaking of movies about the same subject, this week, we found out there are are now two movies about “drug subs” (the practice in which drug smuggling cartels use submarines to get to the USA).  Antoine Fuqua’s Narco Sub was joined in competition this week by Hyperbaric, from Tomorrow Never Dies director Roger Spottiswoode. Neither film has started filming yet, so this race is definitely just beginning.\n\n\n\t\n#1 SCOOBY-DOO REBOOT NOW PLANNED AS LIVE-ACTION (ZOINKS!)\n\nBack in August of 2013, the news broke that Warner Bros was planning on rebooting the classic 1970s cartoon Scooby-Doo as an animated film, and we called it a Fresh Development because of, well, mostly nostalgia, probably. With this week’s news that the Scooby-Doo reboot will just be another live action film (after we already had two of those in 2002 and 2004). It also didn’t help the Fresh or Rotten nature of this story much that it broke on June 17, two days after the passing of Casey Kasem, AKA the voice of Shaggy in the cartoons. Rest in Peace, Casey.\n\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"show","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Jason-Momoa-is-DCs-Aquaman"},{"id":"47509204476432","title":"Weekly Ketchup: The Mummy to Reboot Universal Monsters in 2016","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: The Mummy to Reboot Universal Monsters in 2016\n                        Plus, Ron Howard tackles a Beatles biopic, and more details on prequels for The Shining and The Ring.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 18, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup, which continues our annual lead up to San Diego Comic-Con, was filled with “franchise” news with lots of patterns. There were two different horror prequels (for The Ring and The Shining), multiple references to former partners Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and new roles for Christian Bale, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Jason Sudeikis.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTHE MUMMY RESTARTS UNIVERSAL MONSTERS AVENGERS-STYLE IN 2016\n\nWe’ve known for a while now that Universal Pictures was considering rebooting their “Universal Monsters” (Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, etc.) in a style similar to what Marvel did with The Avengers. In other words, there was a plan to build a shared cinematic universe one monster movie at a time, eventually leading to movies featuring the monsters together. There’s a precedent for this in the golden age of Hollywood (House of Frankenstein, House of Dracula, and Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein), and it’s also something that other studios are also replicating (the Amazing Spider-Man spinoffs and the upcoming DC Comics adaptations).  We’ve also known for a while that the first movie was going to be a reboot of The Mummy, scheduled for April 22, 2016. What changed this week was an announcement of the two Universal-based writers/directors/producers who are spearheading the adaptations. Alex Kurtzman (Star Trek, The Amazing Spider-Man 2) will be joined in this endeavor by screenwriter Chris Morgan, who worked on the three most recent Fast &amp; Furious franchise entries. Kurtzman and Morgan are having regular meetings now about how to create a new movie universe that will also include the Bride of Frankenstein’s Monster, the Invisible Man, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon (and you can read more about Kurtzman’s thoughts on it here). Alex Kurtzman is also still developing the Amazing Spider-Man spinoffs Venom and The Sinister Six, but someone who isn’t is his former screenwriting partner Roberto Orci, who revealed this week that he has departed The Amazing Spider-Man 3.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 CHRISTIAN BALE AS CRIME FICTION ICON TRAVIS MCGEE IN THE DEEP BLUE GOOD-BY\n\nOne of the long-in-development projects at 20th Century Fox for the last few years has an adaptation of the 1964 John D. MacDonald novel The Deep Blue Good-By, which launched a series of 21 novels about the “salvage consultant” Travis McGee, who specializes in helping people re-aquire valuables which are no longer in their possession. Leonardo DiCaprio was at one time attached to the project, and previous potential directors have included Oliver Stone and Paul Greengrass. This week, it was revealed that Christian Bale is in early talks to reunite with writer/director James Mangold (Walk the Line, The Wolverine), with whom he worked on the remake of 3:10 to Yuma. If Mangold can figure the character out, Travis McGee has a chance at becoming a future big screen favorite, as one can trace elements of the character in such later figures as Jim Rockford, Han Solo, and “The Dude” from The Big Lebowski. James Mangold is also currently working on the script for another Wolverine movie. As for Christian Bale, if The Deep Blue Good-By proves successful, he may have found a new franchise now that he’s done with Batman.\n\n\n\t\n#2 DIRECTOR AND PREMISE ANNOUNCED FOR THE SHINING PREQUEL OVERLOOK HOTEL\n\nWhen the premise was first floated out into the online space, the idea of Overlook Hotel as a prequel to Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining was deemed by this column to be the most “Rotten Idea” of that week. And we still felt that way last year, too. Another year down the road, and I guess we’re warming up to the idea now. Director Mark Romanek (One Hour Photo, Never Let Me Go), who has sort of taken over Terrence Malick’s status as a “one great movie per decade” director, is now the helmer to whom Warner Bros is talking about directing Overlook Hotel. We also learned with this story what sort of prequel Overlook Hotel will be, and it’s not the movie we expected (ie, one that tells the stories of some of the ghosts seen in The Shining). Instead, Overlook Hotel will tell the story of a “robber baron at the turn of the 20th century, [Bob T.] Watson scaled the remote peaks of the Colorado Rockies to build the grandest resort in America, and a place he and his family would also call home.” If he signs on, Romanek will be directing from a screenplay written by Glen Mazzarra, former showrunner of the hit TV series The Walking Dead. Mark Romanek is also attached to direct The Boston Strangler for Warner Bros, with Casey Affleck set to star.\n\n\n\t\n#3 CHLOE GRACE MORETZ VOICING LEAD ROLE IN ANIME THE TALE OF THE PRINCESS KAGUYA\n\nAcclaimed anime director Hayao Miyazaki is retired now, but Studio Ghibli continues on. GKIDS is distributing the fantasy adaptation The Tale of the Princess Kaguya (starting October 17 2014), directed by Ghibli cofounder Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies, My Neighbors the Yamadas), who is directing his first film in 14 years.  This week, we learned that the English voice cast will be led by Chloe Grace Moretz in the title role. Other voice actors will include Beau Bridges, James Caan, Dean Cain, Darren Criss, James Marsden, Oliver Platt, and Mary Steenburgen. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, based on a Japanese folktale, is about “a tiny girl found inside a shining stalk of bamboo. She grows into an exquisite young lady, raised by an old bamboo cutter and his wife. From the countryside to the grand capital city, even unseen she enthralls all who encounter her, including five noble suitors. Ultimately she must face her fate, punishment for her crime.”\n\n\n\t\n#4 DISNEY CASTS 10 YEAR OLD NEWCOMER NEEL SETHI TO BE THE ONLY LIVE ACTOR IN THE JUNGLE BOOK\n\nThere’s pressure, there’s beginner’s luck, and then there’s making your acting debut as the only live action actor in a major tentpole production. That’s exactly what has happened for 10 year old Neel Sethi of New York, who will make his acting debut in Walt Disney’s The Jungle Book, directed by Jon Favreau. Neel Sethi landed the role of Mowgli as part of a worldwide audition process that saw thousands of young boys read for the role, from India to London to New York to New Zealand. As Mowgli, Sethi will be surrounded by jungle animals voiced by Idris Elba, Sir Ben Kingsley, Scarlett Johansson, and Lupita Nyong’o, when the movie is released on October 19, 2015.\n\n\t\n#5 RON HOWARD TO DIRECT DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE BEATLES\n\nAs the old joke goes, if you saw the Beatles play live but couldn’t hear them, neither did the band, so loud were the fans. Now, a new documentary is being put together that might be aiming to replicate what that experience was like (since none of us have a time machine… yet). It doesn’t have a title yet, but Apple Corps and Imagine Entertainment are teaming up to produce a documentary about the “touring years” for the Beatles, which stretched from 1963 until 1966, when the band finally gave up to focus on studio recordings.  This Beatles project will be directed by Ron Howard, who made his documentary debut last year with the Jay-Z concert film Made in America. Ron Howard’s next two narrative features will be In the Heart of the Sea and the Dan Brown adaptation Inferno.\n\n\n\t\n#6 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL: THE SURPRISING GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY SPOILER, PLUS MORE\n\nWhen one has a job like the Weekly Ketchup, a certain amount of “spoilers” are to be expected. What’s super rare is a situation where this writer just goes “la la la la la,” all-fingers-in-ears, and closes the page before I see more about a given film than I want to know. Exactly that happened this week with Guardians of the Galaxy, which is only two weeks from opening. To keep the secret from being revealed or ruined for them, I’m not even telling the Rotten Tomatoes staff what this particular story is about. If you’re ready to be spoiled, here you go, but we would just ask to avoid getting into details in the comments. Having said that, let’s just say, “wow,” as this particular character comes as quite a surprise, and it opens up new possibilities for future Marvel films that we didn’t even know the studio was considering. The character in question seemed as likely to be in a movie as, say, Stan Lee doing a cameo appearance in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Not that it will ever, ever happen either, but Stan Lee is still joking about it.  Finally, this was also the week in which Marvel Comics announced the female Thor, and Falcon taking over as Captain America, but both are probably non-starters for the Marvel movies, as those stories will probably be finished just in time for next year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron. (Speaking of which, this also happened this week). We can probably file these changes next to such past phenomenons as “Lady Loki,” and the deaths of Superman, Supergirl, the Flash, Green Lantern, Jimmy Olsen, Jean Grey, the Human Torch, Captain America, Thor, Vision, Wasp, Nightcrawler, Colossus, and… the list is too long.  This is why the Internet invented hyperlinks. Anyway, yeah, be wary of taking too seriously “big changes” in comic book characters.\n\n\n\t\n#7 JASON SUDEIKIS AND JEREMY IRONS JOIN JESSE OWENS BIOPIC RACE\n\nJason Sudeikis and Jeremy Irons have joined the cast of Focus Features’ Race, the quickly developing biopic about Olympic athlete Jesse Owens, who will be played by relative newcomer Stephen James. This is also the fist we’ve heard about Race being the title of this particular film, which is one of those why-didn’t-I-think-of-that examples of surprisingly sublime obviousness. Of course, a movie about the African-American runner who embarrassed Adolf Hitler is going to be called… Race. Clever. Race will be directed by Stephen Hopkins, whose almost entirely “Rotten” RT Tomatometer is the reason this story was almost a Rotten Idea (barely saved by his one “Fresh” film being another biopic, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 POWER RANGERS RECRUITS A FIRST CLASS PAIR OF SCREENWRITERS\n\nJust like how slow this column was to adjust to the idea of a “reboot” of [MIGHTY MORPHIN] POWER RANGERS, we’re going to slot this story as one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, regardless of how much people like one of the associated Marvel Mutant Power Wranglers movies.  So, yes, Lionsgate has recruited X-Men: First Class writers Ashley Miller and Zack Steintz to start work on adapting their new Power Rangers movie, just as the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie is just a few weeks away from release (and that one also formerly tried to just have two words in the title instead of four). This story also brought with it the news that Power Rangers is now being executive produced by Roberto Orci.\n\n\t\n#1 THE RING FRANCHISE TO GET A THIRD (OR SEVENTH) MOVIE, AS A PREQUEL\n\nTrying to explain the release history of the horror franchise built around The Ring would be a lot easier if you could just refer someone to the tape. Anyway, so, first there was a Japanese film called Ringu, and then that got an English language remake as The Ring, which was followed by its own sequel, while the there were three more Japanese movies as well. So, this week’s news that Paramount Pictures is developing a prequel film about Samara, the dead girl in the tape, means that it will either be the third movie, or the seventh, depending upon how you count. The director hired to tackle the prequel is Brazil’s F. Javier Gutierrez, who still hasn’t had his English language debut, mostly because the efforts to reboot The Crow have not yet been realized. The prequel is currently being called The Ring 3D. Many of the teenagers who first made The Ring a box office sensation in 2002 are now almost 30, and quickly aging out of being interested in prequels to The Ring.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Now, tv","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-The-Mummy-to-Reboot-Universal-Monsters-in-2016"},{"id":"47509204485650","title":"Weekly Ketchup: World Cup Frenzy Brings a Victory Remake","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: World Cup Frenzy Brings a Victory Remake\n                        Plus new films for Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, and Tina Fey, plus a sequel for Enchanted\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 3, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup comes to you in a week where the Friday is also the 4th of July!  So, what that meant for the movie development news world is that there were a few less stories, but even so, some cool gems showed up. We’ve got a very timely soccer movie announcement (Victory), cool casting for Idris Elba and Tom Hardy in what might be significant roles, and new films from the directors of Downfall, Babel, Jane Eyre, and The Secret World of Arriety. It was a week more about “films” than “movies.”\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWORLD CUP FRENZY GIVES US REMAKE OF VICTORY\n\nMovie development news announcements are frequently timed and/or inspired by some of the biggest cultural events of the moment.  These past few weeks (and globally, right up until July 13), the World Cup was the biggest thing going.  At the movies right now, director Doug Liman very much has a movie in play, in the form of the Tom Cruise science-fiction action brain twister Edge of Tomorrow.  Those two connections come together with the news that Doug Liman is negotiating to develop a remake of the 1981 soccer and war movie Victory. That film featured an international cast, headlined by Michael Caine for the Brits, Sylvester Stallone for the USA, and Pelé for Brazil and professional soccer players in general. The story, which is being adapted in the remake by Gavin O’Connor (cowriter/director of Warrior and Pride and Glory), is simple: a group of international Allied POW prisoners participate in a soccer game against Nazi Germany in occupied Paris, while the French Resistance attempts a jail break with the game as a distraction.  So, the next question is who are the 2010s stars that are likely to be cast in those roles now? Might David Beckham be getting a call?\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 IDRIS ELBA STARS IN AFRICAN WAR DRAMA BEASTS OF NO NATION\n\nNormally, the Weekly Ketchup is filled with development ideas and casting announcements for movies that are months or usually years away from being filmed. This story is for a movie that slipped under the Ketchup’s radar. This week, we got our first look at Idris Elba (Thor, Pacific Rim) in Beasts of No Nation as the commandant of a group of young guerrillas caught up in a civil war in West Africa.  Beasts of No Nation is being directed by Cary Fukunaga, who a few years ago directed that amazing looking remake of Jane Eyre with Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska. Beasts of No Nation will be distributed by Focus Features sometime in 2015.\n\n\t\n#2 TOM HARDY JOINS LEONARDO DICAPRIO IN WESTERN REVENGE FILM THE REVENANT\n\nThere’s been rumors recently, but this week it was confirmed that Tom Hardy will costar in the western revenge film The Revenant. The lead role will be played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will Poulter (We’re the Millers) is also in talks for a supporting role.  The Revenant will be directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Babel, 21 Grams), whose latest film is Birdman, the upcoming film with Michael Keaton playing an actor who used to star in a superhero franchise (who is now haunted by that character). The Revenant will be filmed this fall of 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#3 WHEN MARNIE WAS THERE: THE LATEST FROM ANIME STUDIO GHIBLI\n\nThis is another case where we’re getting information about a movie much later in the production than with other types of movies. The trailer came online this week for the anime film When Marnie was There, from Studio Ghibli. Hayao Miyazaki is retired now, but Studio Ghibli continues on, with this adaptation of this 1981 book by Joan G. Robinson, about a strange friendship that develops between two young girls. When Marnie was There was directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, who is best known right now for 2012’s The Secret World of Arrietty.\n\n\t\n#4 DOWNFALL DIRECTOR TO GIVE US ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT KILLING HITLER\n\nReally, we can’t see Hitler die, or almost die, enough.  German director Oliver Hirschbiegel first became internationally known for the German language films Das Experiment and Downfall, that movie about Hitler’s last days that you’ve probably seen one scene from, about 20 times. Then, for the last ten years, Hirschbiegel tried his hands at English language films (The Invasion and Diana) which have had less success. It might be within that context that Hirschbiegel is now focusing again on the German language story of Georg Elser. A few years ago, Valkyrie told the story of an assassination plot against Adolf Hitler in 1944, but Georg Elser depicts an attempt on November 8, 1939, five years earlier. Christian Friedel (The White Ribbon) stars as Georg Elser. The film will be released in Germany on April 2, 2015, and doesn’t yet have U.S. distribution.\n\n\n\t\n#5 TINA FEY TO STAR IN DISNEY WITCH MOVIE\n\nWalt Disney Pictures is very much in the witch business lately, which if you stretch its definition a bit, can include Oz the Great and Powerful, Maleficent, and Enchanted 2, which you can read about down below. There’s also a rumored Hocus Pocus sequel, which is where we can start with this story. When it first broke online earlier this week, there was some confusion. Basically, the headlines were that Tina Fey was going to star in a Hocus Pocus sequel, which her camp quickly denied. It turns out that what Tina Fey is really doing with Walt Disney Pictures is an untitled witch comedy in the style of Ghostbusters. So, really, the lead ended up getting buried. Instead of talking about Hocus Pocus, people should really be getting excited that Tina Fey might play something like a modern day “witch hunter,” getting together with kooky coworkers and putting on funky suits. Or maybe it will be something completely different… but still “like” Ghostbusters. But with witches. More immediately, Tina Fey has The Nest, a sister comedy with Amy Poehler, which John Cena joined this week, in his “first villain” role. And finally, this week, Tina Fey made the news yet again, with the news that she is attached to star in an adaptation of The Taliban Shuffle, as an American journalist in Afghanistan. The Taliban Shuffle will be directed by Crazy Stupid Love directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. Tina Fey is one busy lady.\n\n\n\t\n#6 JASON BATEMAN’S DIRECTING CAREER CONTINUES WITH A NEW STEVE CARELL COMEDY\n\nFollowing Jason Bateman’s directorial debut with Bad Words, the actor got another directing gig from the same production company. The comedy doesn’t yet have a title, but Steve Carell is attached to star as one of F.B.I. agents who pretend to fall in love and get married in order to trap the mob. This movie will not however be Jason Bateman’s second movie as director, because he first has the novel adaptation The Family Fang, which he will also star in, along with Nicole Kidman and Christopher Walken.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 TROY GETS A COMPANION EPIC: ODYSSEUS\n\nTen years ago, Warner Bros gave us the ancient war epic Troy, based upon the heroic poem The Iliad. Now, the studio is returning to a related Homer poem, The Odyssey, which is being called Odysseus, after the main character. Warner Bros has hired Russian director Fedor Bondarchuk, whose latest film was Stalingrad. Sean Bean played Odysseus in Troy, but it’s possible/probably/likely that Warner Bros will cast someone else in the role (and other roles). For those rusty on their Greek literature, The Odyssey is about the hard and long decade that Odysseus spends trying to return home to his wife after fighting at Troy with Achilles. In a possibly related story, this week Warner Bros also expanded their studio and production/post space at Leavesden Studio in the U.K. The new, bigger studio is currently being used for Pan, with Tarzan following soon after. It wasn’t specifically mentioned, but Odysseus might also be filmed there.\n\n\n\t\n#2 G.I. JOE 3 RAMPING UP FOR RELEASE IN 2016\n\nThe Weekly Ketchup uses RT’s Tomatometer scores pretty heavily, but in Hollywood, when we’re talking about the big event films, it’s really the box office that matters. So, for a franchise like G.I. Joe, which has a sort of dismal track record, Paramount will (probably) keep making sequels until the audience stops showing up in droves. The next film is already scheduled for 2016, but right now, the project is still at the script stage.  Paramount Pictures has recruited veteran writer Jonathan Lemkin, whose filmography includes Shooter, Red Planet, and Lethal Weapon 4. It’s not yet known which characters will return for the third live action G.I. Joe, except Dwayne Johnson, who is perceived as the one actor they absolutely need to have for G.I. Joe 3.\n\n\n\t\n#1 ENCHANTED SEQUEL GETS HELP FROM SHREK AND THE SMURFS (SORT OF)\n\nAmidst all of the live action remakes of classic Disney animated movies, Walt Disney Pictures is not forgetting the 2007 film which sort of predicted the trend that would be coming soon. Walt Disney Pictures has hired the screenwriting team of J. David Stem and David N. Weiss to start work on a sequel script for Enchanted 2. Amy Adams, James Marsden, and Patrick Dempsey starred in Enchanted, but there’s no deals announced for the sequel, which will be directed by Anne Fletcher (Rock of Ages, The Proposal, The Guilt Trip). Other movies from the Stem/Weiss team include Daddy Day Care, Clockstoppers, and The Rugrats Movie, so we’re going to go with “Rotten Idea” on this one, for now, and this week, the worst (in a slow week, based almost entirely on all those green splotches on the Tomatometer).\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"the, Paquin, justice, Super, versus, CMT, America","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-World-Cup-Frenzy-Brings-a-Victory-Remake"},{"id":"47509204491797","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Wonder Woman and Justice League Dates Rumored","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Wonder Woman and Justice League Dates Rumored\n                        Plus, new roles for Ryan Gosling, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Tom Hiddleston.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 13, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis Ketchup covers another week full of superhero movie news (including Justice League, Wonder Woman, and Ant-Man). Also included in the mix were film development stories for two movies based on 1990s gaming phenomenons (Sonic the Hedgehog and Magic: The Gathering), and new roles for Ryan Gosling, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Tom “Loki” Hiddleston.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nDC (RUMORED) TO ANNOUNCE JUSTICE LEAGUE, WONDER WOMAN\n\nFor the most part, the Weekly Ketchup tries to avoid spending too much time on unconfirmed rumors. Every once in a while, however, there are exceptions. This week, Deadline.com co-founder Nikki Finke launched her new blog with the scoop of what Warner Bros and DC Comics are (possibly) announcing next month at San Diego Comic-Con.  What’s included in the mix are enough movies to give WB/DC three movies a year, starting in 2016 with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If Finke’s source holds up, that movie would be followed by Shazam (July, 2016), Sandman (December, 2016), Justice League (May, 2017), Wonder Woman (July, 2017), a Flash/Green Lantern team up (December, 2017), and Man of Steel 2 (May, 2018).  A few of those movies aren’t really surprises (Sandman, Justice League, and Wonder Woman), but the placement of some of them is unexpected (namely that Wonder Woman would be #5 on such a list).  The long-in-development Shazam (Marvel owns the title rights to Captain Marvel) being #2 is a surprise, as is the notion that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is not a Man of Steel sequel (perhaps the idea is that Man of Steel 2 would be the next solo Superman movie). Other DC titles that WB is known to have in development include The Metal Men, The Suicide Squad, and Guillermo del Toro’s Justice League Dark project. This scoop about WB planning three DC movies a year comes at a time when the current top 3 box office movies for 2014 are all based on Marvel characters (Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, X-Men: Days of Future Past), even if only one of them was directly made by Marvel. Fans gripe about Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four being outside Marvel’s purveyance, but it’s also part of why Marvel characters dominate the movies so much (three studios can simply produce more big movies than just one alone). So, even if this rumor is true, and WB/DC release three movies in 2016, they’ll (possibly) be going up against Captain America 3, X-Men: Apocalypse, The Amazing Spider-Man 3 (though that one might be pushed to 2017), and an untitled Marvel film (that’s probably Doctor Strange). And that’s presuming Marvel doesn’t have its own plans to increase the number of movies it releases each year. And here’s one more related story: it’s probably not a coincidence that the day before Nikki Finke’s scoop, Warner Bros and Mattel extended their toy contract for characters from comics, TV shows, and movies.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 JAKE GYLLENHAAL PLANS DEMOLITION WITH DALLAS BUYERS CLUB DIRECTOR\n\nBefore last year’s Dallas Buyers Club, French-Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee was mostly known (if he was known at all) for 2009’s The Young Victoria. A year later, Vallee is being seen by some as something of an acclaim supplier after Dallas Buyers Club landed Academy Awards for both Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto.  If there’s any validity to this notion, then we learned this week that it might be Jake Gyllenhaal who next benefits from whatever magic mojo Vallee can give to his male stars. Jake Gyllenhaal is in talks with John Malkovich’s Mr. Mudd production company to star in Demolition, which Jean-Marc Vallee has lined up as his next picture. Written by Bryan Sipe, Demolition is “the story of an investment banker struggling to understand his emotional disconnect after the tragic death of his wife. He begins to tear apart his life in a effort to see where he went wrong and is ultimately rescued by a woman he meets in a chance encounter.” And then, hilarity ensues (…or not).  Presumably, the next step would be to cast the female lead.\n\n\n\t\n#2 TOM HIDDLESTON: FROM LOKI TO… HANK WILLIAMS, SR?\n\nWhen Tom Hiddleston, AKA Marvel’s Loki, showed up recently in Muppets Most Wanted, not looking anything like Loki, many audience members may have felt like, “I know that guy… but I can’t quite place the face.” Hiddleston is currently in exactly that position: he’s had one really big breakout role, but in other films, he’s still enough of a cipher that his fame doesn’t interfere. As such, Hiddleston may still be in the position of being able to star in a biopic without audiences being distracted. It also doesn’t hurt that the biopic in question is for someone better known to modern audiences for his voice than his face.  Tom Hiddleston is attached to star as country singer Hank Williams (Sr) in the biopic I Saw the Light. Hank Williams Sr was one of the first superstars of country music, who died before his 30th birthday in 1953, leaving behind eerily prophetic songs with titles like “I’ll Never Get Out of This World Alive.” When filming starts in Louisiana in October, Tom Hiddleston will not only adopt an Alabama accent, but he will do all of the singing for the role as well. I Saw the Light will be the second film as director (after 2006’s Flash of Genius) for Marc Abraham, who is best known as a producer of films like Children of Men, Slither, and the recent remakes of Dawn of the Dead, The Thing, and RoboCop. So, are you ready for some football, you mewling quim?\n\n\n\t\n#3 RYAN GOSLING AND RUSSELL CROWE MAY TEAM UP FOR KISS KISS, BANG BANG DIRECTOR\n\nIt may seem obvious now, but when Shane Black cast Robert Downey, Jr. for the 2005 film Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, RDJ was three years away from fully making his comeback as Iron Man. (Unfortunately, whatever magic was in the air for RDJ didn’t rub off on costar Val Kilmer… yet.)  The next two stars that Shane Black is hoping to work with are Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, who are being courted for the 1970s film noir The Nice Guys. Set in 1970s Los Angeles, The Nice Guys is about two alcoholics who team up to investigate the “suicide” of a porn actress after their aunt reports seeing her alive after her supposed death. Talks are ongoing, and Russell Crowe’s involvement is particularly questionable, as filming may conflict with upcoming publicity for his directorial debut, The Water Diviner, which is expected to be doing the festival circuit this fall.\n\n\n\t\n#4 DREAMWORKS ANIMATION UNVEILS SCHEDULE FOR 2016-2018, INCLUDING CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS\n\nTaking advantage of the hype for their new film How to Train Your Dragon 2, DreamWorks Animation this week unveiled their release plans for the years 2017 and 2018, which continues DWA’s steady rate of three films a year. In 2017, DreamWorks Animation will be giving us the children’s book series adaptation Captain Underpants (1/13/17), the possibly to-be-retitled Mumbai Musical (3/10/17), and the sequel The Croods 2 (11/3/17).  In 2018, DreamWorks’ animated films will be the Australian outback adventure Larrikins (2/16/18), and the sequels Madagascar 4 (5/18/18) and Puss in Boots 2: Nine Lives &amp; 40 Thieves (11/2/18). DreamWorks Animation also announced a new film for March 18, 2016 called Boss Baby, but very little is currently known about it, except that it’s from Madagascar franchise director Tom McGrath.\n\n\n\t\n#5 GAME OF THRONES WRITER/PRODUCER TO STACK THE DECKS OF MAGIC: THE GATHERING\n\nWith Harry Potter done for a few years now, and The Hobbit finishing up this December, Hollywood is currently in something of a lull when it comes to big ambitious fantasy adaptations. However, there is the Warcraft movie coming on March 11, 2016, and there are also plans for a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons reboot. It might be that the next wave of fantasy film franchises might come not from books but from games. What Dungeons &amp; Dragons was to the 1980s, and what World of Warcraft was to the 2000s, is what Magic: The Gathering was to the 1990s. We first heard in January that 20th Century Fox had acquired the film rights to the collectible card game, and this week, the news broke about who will be dealing the cards, so to speak.  Byan Cogman, who has worked as a writer, producer, and story editor on HBO’s Game of Thrones, has been hired by 20th Century Fox, Hasbro, and X-Men writer/producer Simon Kinberg to start work on a Magic: The Gathering script (replacing Kinberg as the project’s writer). There are thousands of Magic: The Gathering cards spread across the many expansion sets, and almost all of them introduce world-building characters, legends, lore, and spells, so there’s a lot of material for Bryan Cogman to potentially adapt.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#4 HARRISON FORD BREAKS HIS ANKLE ON THE MILLENNIUM FALCON SET OF STAR WARS EPISODE VII\n\nUsually, a story’s Fresh or Rotten status is at least partly a reflection of the potential “quality” of the movie in question. Sometimes, however, a story is just Rotten because, you know, we don’t want bad things to happen to cool people. That’s the case with this one, which you may have already heard about, but here we go: Harrison Ford was hospitalized this week in England following an accident on the Star Wars Episode VII set in which his right ankle was broken (ouch!) by one of the doors on the Millennium Falcon. Filming will continue while Ford rests and recuperates. Anyway, this is a good opportunity for us to reflect back on some of Harrison Ford’s right ankle’s best performances.  This was also a fairly busy week for unconfirmed Star Wars rumors, including possible scoops about the characters played by John Boyega and Domhnall Gleeson, and a rumor that Simon Pegg might appear in Star Wars Episode VII.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THIS WEEK IN FILM CREW CHANGES: WB’S BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, PACIFIC RIM 2, AND NOW YOU SEE ME 2\n\nJust a week after Walt Disney Pictures announced that director Bill Condon has joined their live action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the previously announced Warner Bros version of the story hit a snag this week. Although Emma Watson is still involved, and a new director is in the process of being sought, Guillermo del Toro will no longer be the man behind the camera.  Guillermo del Toro will still produce the film, which Warner Bros is hoping to still get going before Walt Disney Pictures can finish their own film. Dueling movies, a Hollywood tradition. In addition to directing the haunted house film Crimson Peak, Guillermo del Toro also made the news this week by talking up his plans for a sequel to last year’s Pacific Rim. The news here is that Travis Beacham, who wrote the first film, is not returning for the sequel. Instead, del Toro is now collaborating with Zak Penn, who is best known for working on a whole bunch of Marvel adaptations, for both Marvel itself and 20th Century Fox. It’s worth noting that GDT and Zak Penn are proceeding with this despite the fact that, technically, Legendary Pictures hasn’t yet given a greenlight to a sequel to Pacific Rim. And finally, in other sequel director news, Lionsgate is talking to Jon M. Chu (who is currently filming Jem and the Holograms) about replacing Louis Leterrier for the sequel to last year’s surprise hit Now You See Me, about a gang of magicians-turned-bank-robbers.\n\n\n\t\n#2 SPEAKING OF GAMES POPULAR IN THE 1990S… SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: THE MOVIE\n\nEven if The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is (currently) the #2 box office success of 2014, there are still pundits that are pointing out that previous Sony Spider-Man movies did much better. It’s all part of a film industry narrative in 2014 that Sony Pictures needs to find more new franchises, and one that the studio appears to be listening to, as they continue to announce exactly those sorts of new projects. This week, the big one was a videogame adaptation which would have seemed highly unlikely back in the 1990s when SEGA and Sony were direct competitors. This is the 2010s, however, and SEGA is not the videogame giant it once was. And so, Sony and SEGA are teaming up for a CG-animated/live action adaptation of Sonic the Hedgehog. We’re calling this one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because the only creative name attached to Sonic the Hedgehog right now is producer Neal H. Moritz, and his RT Tomatometer page is a big long list of Rotten splotches. This news is also notable because Sony is also working with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg on an adaptation of the book Console Wars, about SEGA and Nintendo in the 1990s, and Sonic the Hedgehog was definitely a big part of that larger story.\n\n\n\t\n#1 MARVEL ANNOUNCES NEW DIRECTOR AND WRITER FOR NEXT YEAR’S ANT-MAN\n\nAlthough the news of Edgar Wright’s departure (after eight years) from directing Marvel’s Ant-Man seemed to happen in the midst of an online hurricane of frustration and rage, the news just two weeks later of his replacement seemed to almost get overlooked immediately. The director who finally landed the Ant-Man gig was Peyton Reed, whose films to date have included Bring It On, Down with Love, The Break-Up, and Yes Man. Adam McKay, the director of the Anchorman movies, who had previously been mentioned as a possibility, was also announced as the screenwriter who will be making the script revisions (that reportedly led to Edgar Wright’s departure). Although Peyton Reed directed one movie that this writer really liked (Down with Love), his Tomatometer scores of late has been Rotten, and none of his films except Down with Love had the sort of visual flair you would expect from a superhero movie director. However, Down with Love did have a retro vibe, which might be why Reed was hired for Ant-Man, since it is reportedly partially set in the past.  In other Marvel Studios news, Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch were mentioned as possible stars for Doctor Strange, but Aiden Gillen (“Littlefinger” from Game of Thrones) wasn’t. We all have our favorites, I guess.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Paramount, motion, Academy, canceled, 2019, aliens, ABC, series, GLAAD, Exclusive","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Wonder-Woman-and-Justice-League-Dates-Rumored"}]
