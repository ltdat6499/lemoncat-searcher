Lynskey’s credits include Heavenly Creatures, Togetherness, Two and a Half Men, Coyote Ugly, and Detroit Rock City, just to name a few, and she took some time to chat with RT about her own favorites.&nbsp;With that in mind, here are Melanie Lynskey’s Five Favorite Films:Naked (1993)  88%I guess the first one would be the Mike Leigh movie, Naked.&nbsp;The performances in the movie are so great. David Thewlis&nbsp;—&nbsp;it’s just one of the greatest performances I’ve ever seen. And the movie — they improvised to find a script. They improvised for months and months, and then Mike Leigh writes a script based on the improv, and you can tell that it’s come from such a pure place, because it’s natural for all the actors, but it’s also just the —&nbsp;walking around London, and it’s just incredible. And also, my favorite actress of all time is Katrin Cartlidge, and she’s in that movie. She’s ridiculous in it, she’s so good.Wet Hot American Summer (2001)  38%Possibly the next one would be Wet Hot American Summer. It’s probably a movie I’ve seen more than the other one. And it’s funny. The cast is insane. There’s so many great people and they’re all at their absolute funniest. There’s so many moments of absurdity that really get me; they just make me giggle so much. It’s so, so, so funny. I’ve watched it a million times.I take it you’ve watched the show also?Yes, and I actually just did a little part on the show, and — oh my God. I said to my fiance when I came home — you know when you see actors being interviewed there in the new Star Wars movie, and they’re like, “I can’t believe I got to be a part of this world that I’ve loved for so long?” And I was like, “This is like me doing Star Wars.”The Piano (1993)  90%Would be in the top five. Because I’m from New Zealand, and the movie was very impactful when I saw it. It was so incredible to see a story about the&nbsp;beginnings of my country of New Zealand. Well, not the beginnings, because there were indigenous people there, but when the settlers came, it’s just such an interesting story to see. And also, it was all filmed around where I grew up, and I’ve never seen a movie that was filmed in the part of the world that I grew up in. And Jane Campion is one of my favorite filmmakers.The Piano Teacher (La Pianiste) (2001)  73%It’s a very, very intense movie. Isabelle Huppert, I think, is the greatest living actress. She goes on such a crazy journey in this movie. It’s an incredible performance, and it’s just an impeccably made movie. It’s a perfect movie. You haven’t seen it? Oh, you need to watch it. It’s so intense and so disturbing. Nobody does that kind of glowing sense of dread like Michael Haneke,&nbsp;where you just feel it coming and you’re like, “Oh god, oh my god, what’s going to happen?” I think he’s such a master.I was at a party one time with a friend of mine and I said, “Oh my God, it’s Michael Haneke!” And she was like, “How do you know?” I was really starstruck to see him — like, “How do you know what he looks like?”Did you talk to him?I did. I went up and I just said, “You are one of my favorite filmmakers,” and he said, “Thank you, thank you.” He was very nice.You like disturbing things, I think.I do like disturbing things. Even Wet Hot American Summer is&nbsp;pretty disturbing.Selma (2014)  99%It’s a pretty recent movie but Selma, the Ava DuVernay movie from a couple of years ago. I just can’t remember seeing a movie and it being so clear to me that it was a masterpiece. I mean, I felt similarly about Moonlight this year — I was just like, “Oh, it’s incredible.” But usually movies take a minute to settle with me, and as I was watching Selma I just was like, “This is a masterpiece. This is an incredible movie.” The story is so powerful and the performances are incredible. And it’s made with such clarity and such passion. I think she’s one of the great film makers.Kerr Lordygan for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;How did you get involved with XX?Melanie Lynskey:&nbsp;I know Annie&nbsp;[Clark,”The Birthday Party” segment director]&nbsp;a little bit socially, and she sent me an email one day and said, “I’ve written a short film.” I didn’t really know what it was for, but she said, “Do you want to do it?” And I read it and I thought it was so odd and so cool, and I like her so much, so I just said, “Yeah, let’s do it,” and it was really, really fun.RT:&nbsp;It looked fun. How long did it take you to do that short?Lynskey:&nbsp;Three days.RT:&nbsp;And you have to play opposite a corpse, which is probably challenging.Lynskey:&nbsp;Yeah, but he was a stunt man, so he was very good at carrying some of his own weight so I wasn’t dragging — because it actually would not be possible to drag a body — like, he was dragging it. It wouldn’t be possible, so it was really nice that he was helping me.RT: But it added to the weird factor.Lynskey:&nbsp;Yeah, it’s very weird. It’s so weird.RT: The very ending of “The Birthday Party” is funny. What’s your takeaway of this short, where it came from, and why it’s in XX?Lynskey:&nbsp;I honestly don’t know where it came from, but to me, the horror in it — because it’s not a traditional horror movie, but it just felt like the pressure that women feel to hold everything together, even in the craziest circumstances. That, to me, felt like where the true horror came from. Because she’s not acting rationally in that situation. Why would you carry on with a birthday party that she just feels such a pressure to get it right? And it’s just so funny to me that she’s trying to do everything perfectly, and she’s going around straightening everything, but she never gets out of her nightgown.RT: And it is scary. Neighbors are scary, parents are scary, and being a parent is scary.Lynskey:&nbsp;Yeah, all that stuff is very scary.RT: And that’s why is so interesting that it’s in a horror anthology;&nbsp;I thought that was really interesting. I’ve never seen something like that before.Lynskey:&nbsp;Yeah, it was very original. I was really excited when I read it. Also, Annie [also known as singer/songwriter&nbsp;St. Vincent] is such a creative genius, and she has so much play, and her own costumes and style. And there’s so much comedy in her music — and so much drama — and I just feel really proud of her that she was able to translate that into a completely different medium. It also made me have full confidence that she would be able to.RT: I see elements of music video production in it, but that’s part of why it’s scary. It’s very brightly lit. It’s like every day. That’s what’s so creepy about it.Lynskey:&nbsp;Yeah, and also at the end of the movie, she was doing an homage to that crazy music video for “Black Hole Sun” which is so terrifying.RT: What else can we look forward to from you? I know you mentioned Wet Hot American Summer.Lynskey:&nbsp;Oh yes, that was really fun, but I just have a tiny little part. I have a movie coming out on Netflix on February 24th, that I really love a lot, called I Don’t Feel At Home in This World Anymore.XX is now open in limited&nbsp;release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"to, Marvel, Disney, globes, south, book, on, superhero","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14154803/melanie-lynskey-fea.jpg","slug":"melanie-lynskeys-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508826766447","title":"Garth Davis’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Garth Davis' Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | February 9, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for DGA)Garth Davis&nbsp;is only getting started. With just a few credits to his name (including some TV work on Top of the Lake and Love My Way, as well as a documentary called&nbsp;P.I.N.S.), Davis directed Lion, a drama based on a true story about an adopted Indian man living in Australia who uses Google Earth to track down the small village where he grew up. The film has become a critical darling and an awards favorite, earning six Academy Awards nominations, and it&nbsp;has launched Davis into the big time. With the Oscars arriving shortly, we took the opportunity to speak with him&nbsp;and find out what movies make him tick. Here are Garth Davis’&nbsp;Five Favorite Films:A Woman Under the Influence (1975)  90%This is my favorite. It’s A Woman Under the Influence by John Cassavetes. What I love about his movies — especially this film too — is just the performances are so brave. The characters are so unpredictable. They’re so full of life. Also, there’s such a social commentary in this movie about how society doesn’t allow people to be who they really are, and I just find that a great metaphor for so many things in one’s life. I thought, “Through this one relationship, I’m moved in such a deep way.”I also love how Cassavetes pushes the performances so far that it finds this kind of amazing poetry at a certain point. I particularly remember this scene where Gena Rowlands is basically just so misunderstood and so cut down and beaten down that she finds this physicality. It was almost like a moment of ballet. I just think there’s something very genius going on in that film and very brave and I love it.&nbsp;It’s a beautiful film.Les Amants du Pont-Neuf (The Lovers on the Bridge) (1999)  85%Actually, I just thought of another one which really affected me. I don’t know if I’m going to pronounce it correctly. It’s Les Amants du Pont-Neuf —&nbsp;Lovers on the Pont-Neuf [aka Lovers on the Bridge]. It has Juliette Binoche in it and Denis Lavant. He’s very good. I was a university student when this came out.&nbsp;It’s kind of a love story of a privileged girl who’s going blind and she kind of runs away from her privileged life to live on the streets. And she falls in love eventually or creates this friendship with this homeless man. It’s an extraordinary film. It just blew my mind. Again, the filmmaking was incredibly brave and just committed and front-foot and so unique. Again, a film that looks at relationships and has a life in the characters — very alive. I don’t know. It was just an experience to watch that film. I just love it.Seems you’re into deep character studies and human drama.Yup. The human condition. Otherwise I’m not watching it [laughing].The 400 Blows (Les Quatre cents coups) (1959)  100%I love 400 Blows. [François] Truffaut&nbsp;is just a genius and, again, just there’s a total Cassavetian quality in his performances as well. I know that story was close to his own story, so that was very moving and just a totally immersive experience. I like him and a lot of the French filmmakers, obviously, for the exact reason we’re talking about. That last scene in 400 Blows where he escapes the children’s home in that really, really long tracking shot was just astonishing, just such an astonishing end to that film. That and when the kids steal a typewriter too, and they’re struggling with the weight of it; that was great. It’s just great, great fun.Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971)  90%Okay. I’m going to say a weird one here — but what an amazing performance in that film. When I was a kid I just loved these kind of movies that just took me to another world. I still like watching it today. I watch it with my kids. Gene Wilder. What a performance. It’s just extraordinary. It’s just a film that’s always stayed with me and I still love it today. It’s still fascinating to look at. Gene Wilder is just wild and kind of lonely and mad and so unhinged. It’s a fantastic film.My Name Is Joe (Mein Name ist Joe) (1999)  89%Maybe My Name Is Joe, to mix it up a bit. At the time when I saw this, I was just wanting to get into filmmaking and I was really fascinated by Ken Loach&nbsp;— and Mike Leigh&nbsp;— because, again, they were social realist films. Loach is more politically based. My Name Is Joe was just such a moving film and it basically portrayed a portrait of a man that basically didn’t have a choice in the choices he made because of his political situation, and then, just how that wasn’t really enough. It was a really tragic, moving film. I just love that film.Lion&nbsp;is now open in limited&nbsp;release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"poppins","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/07144402/garth-davis-fea.jpg","slug":"garth-davis-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827939969","title":"Toni Collette’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Toni Collette's Five Favorite FilmsThe Acclaimed Actress Reveals the Film She Watched Repeatedly After Having Her Appendix Removed (as a Childhood Prank).by RT Staff | August 19, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Getty Images / John Sciulli / StringerA cornucopia of marvelous&nbsp;roles in film (The Hours,&nbsp;About a Boy,&nbsp;The Sixth Sense,&nbsp;Glassland,&nbsp;Krampus) and TV&nbsp;(United States of Tara,&nbsp;Hostages) has garnered Toni Collette a bounty of&nbsp;well-deserved awards and acclaim from critics and audiences alike. In the new film Imperium&nbsp;—&nbsp;opening today in limited release — she teams with Daniel Radcliffe&nbsp;and Nestor Carbonell in a drama&nbsp;inspired by real events about an undercover agent who tries to take down a white supremacist terrorist group. As a performer in various genres (with a musical career to boot), Collette clearly has influences from all around. Here we have her Five Favorite Films — in her own words –to shed some more light on her professional and personal journey:Harold and Maude (1971)  84%I love this film and can watch it over and over. Hal Ashby is one of my favorite filmmakers. Both the lead characters are so unique and their pairing even more so. The thing that I love about it the most is Maude’s incredible sense of freedom and her direct influence on Harold. Death awaits us all, and it’s easy to shrink in that knowledge, but she teaches him to embrace life and be himself and choose to be positive and open. Their connection is so lovely and inspirational. This film tackles life, death, and everything in between in the most entertaining way.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)  92%A modern classic. So original and exciting to watch. The premise itself is like a science fiction story, except that it is all very human and emotional. I think it’s Jim Carrey‘s best and most relatable performance. Kate [Winslet] is always amazing, but here she gets to do something she’d never done before. She’s so scattered and passionate and real. It’s heartbreaking because it’s about heartbreak and vulnerability and the inability to navigate through it all, which is, of course, an essential part of the human experience. It’s entirely unique, from an original voice, and that, in itself, deserves applause. The music is brilliant also.The Sound of Music (1965)  83%There is an embarrassing story flying around about me faking appendicitis when I was eleven years old. Sadly, it’s true. The upshot of the experience is that whilst I was in hospital my parents bought a beta VCR player. So on the way home after being released, we stopped at a very small garage (or gas station) which had a few shelves of movies. There were no video stores yet. We hired The Sound of Music for two weeks and I watched it repeatedly, several times a day, while I recovered. Needless to say, I know every word and love it dearly. I guess I love the way the family slowly embraces Maria. She has such a good heart, and it finds the perfect home. How do&nbsp;you solve a problem like Maria?!Breaking the Waves (1996)  85%OK look, I have only seen this film once and I will never watch it again. But the effect it had on me was so profound that it kind of shifted things creatively inside me. I went to the cinema one night in London with two very good friends when I was 24. It blew me away. It’s so raw and so poetic at the same time. Emily Watson was sublime. I came out of the theater in a daze and the three of us wandered around the streets of Soho for hours not quite knowing what to do with ourselves. I literally didn’t sleep all night. I just lay there in my hotel room reliving the story. Even now I can see the bleak color palette, the camera moves, and Emily’s naive face. Lars Von Trier is a genius. Every film he makes is so honest and powerful.Terms of Endearment (1983)  78%It’s basically my perfect movie. Character driven with phenomenal performances, so idiosyncratic, and funny as hell, as well as achingly sad. The ideal combination of comedy and tragedy. I adore Shirley [MacLaine] and Jack [Nicholson] together. I love them, full stop. It’s the most satisfying tearjerker ever made because the lows are so beautifully balanced with gorgeous, swelling highs.Imperium&nbsp;opens today&nbsp;in limited&nbsp;release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Disney, romantic, Esquire, SXSW, pirates, blockbusters, Review","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/18145802/toni-rep1.jpg","slug":"toni-collettes-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827922557","title":"Rachel Lambert’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rachel Lambert's Five Favorite FilmsThe Director/Co-Writer of TIFF Premiere In the Radiant City Reveals the Film Her Friends Are Forbidden to Dislike and What Makes Her Dance in the Streets of New York.by Kerr Lordygan | September 13, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Rick Diamond / Getty ImagesOne of the films making waves at the Toronto International Film Festival this year is In the Radiant City, directed and co-written by&nbsp;Rachel Lambert. Having directed the short film&nbsp;Kin&nbsp;and the documentary Mom Jovi —&nbsp;which premiered at this year’s Nashville Film Festival —&nbsp;Radiant City is Lambert’s first scripted feature. Her background producing and writing for theatre doubly ensured her capacity for executing legitimate&nbsp;drama, be it on stage or screen. So, while her name may be&nbsp;new to you, her work experience is&nbsp;extensive and respected. Lambert is a true lover of film — something evidenced&nbsp;by her passion and thoughtfulness when discussing her five favorites with us. So check out the list here and get a&nbsp;head start on learning about this terrific up-and-coming talent:&nbsp;The Godfather (1972)  97%For one, I remember seeing it on the TNT marathon for a weird American holiday — a random birthday of a president or something — and they were doing this marathon, and I watched it and I watched it again and again and again on this marathon, and I couldn’t stop watching it. From that point on, I remember I went out and got the AFI top 100 list — back before you could look it up online — and I decided I was going to watch every single movie on that list.Wonder Boys (2000)  81%It’s dramatically different [from The Godfather] in terms of this town and the world of it. It’s a good movie, tremendously. I’m a writer, so obviously I enjoy the content because it’s about writer things and writer dramas and writer people. It’s just one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen. I can watch that movie over and over again. Robert Downey Jr. gives one of his best performances ever. And very funny. And I love Michael Douglas in it; he’s great. But it also has this wonderful capacity for pathos in this very earned way. It doesn’t feel kitsch. It feels really earned and honest, so it can play those lines really well.The Big Lebowski (1998)  83%My remaining three I organized by directors because I was like, “OK, there are three directors that I adhere to like gospel,” and so I collected my favorite of each of theirs. The third one being The Big Lebowski by the Coen Brothers [Ethan and Joel], because I think that if you can’t enjoy that movie than I don’t think we could ever be friends. It’s like a rule in my life. There is no way I could ever be friends with someone who didn’t find that entertaining and funny.Is that the first thing you ask when you meet somebody?“Hi, my name is Rachel. Did you like The Big Lebowski? No? Get out of my face. Get out [laughing].” I was really, really debating between that and Inside Llewyn Davis. I went with Big Lebowski because I thought, “Which one could I not live without?” That’s the one. I couldn’t live without it. A perfect example of why that movie is just so smart and so unexpected is they found the space in the narrative to have them all go to his landlord’s dance rehearsal — or dance recital, actually. They found space and made sure to take an afternoon to go to the landlord’s dance performance! I’ve never seen a movie make time for that. I thought it was brilliant, and I’m like, “Yeah , of course he’d go. That’s the kind of guy who would go. He said he was going to go, so he’d go.” I just thought that was genius.Magnolia (1999)  83%Paul Thomas Anderson. Magnolia. I just really love it. I mean, yeah, There Will be Blood is also a close contender; I love that too. But Magnolia — the audacity of it. I watched that movie and it’s scary by the end of it [laughing]. You’ve gone through this sort of tapestry of humanity that I feel is very hard to match in a lot of cinema these days. He is always surprising me, but that movie just… He finds a way to get the drama — he has a moment where everyone starts breaking out in unified song. And it feels totally authentic and earned. I’ve never seen a movie that does that but didn’t feel indulgent.Jackie Brown (1997)  87%Since I love Quentin Tarantino, I went with Jackie Brown – that’s my favorite Quentin Tarantino film. I could go on and on about why Tarantino is a master of dialogue and writing — I mean I love The&nbsp;Hateful Eight;&nbsp;I think that’s sort of genius of him as a director — but Jackie Brown is such a perfectly contained piece. It’s exciting but also has these perfectly human moments where characters are talking about growing older, and they ally themselves in this plot not because of… I mean there is gain financially and there is gain for personal reasons, but there is also this sort of camaraderie that’s born. It’s also incredibly clever and funny. I just love that. I love the soundtrack as well. You can’t love a Tarantino film and not love the soundtrack. I’m not gonna lie, I’ve strutted down New York City streets to Quentin Tarantino soundtracks! That’s for real. But I mean Jackie Brown is amazing, centered, and &nbsp;[has] these unexpected characters. Samuel Jackson gives the performance of a lifetime.In the Radiant City is premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Calendar, Month","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/12184525/rachel-rep.jpg","slug":"rachel-lamberts-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827948164","title":"Sharon Jones’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sharon Jones' Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | August 5, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Getty Images / Theo WargoTo paraphrase the title of one of her records, Sharon Jones&nbsp;learned it the hard way. The life and times of the former corrections officer-turned-nonpareil soul singer are chronicled in Barbara Kopple’s Miss Sharon Jones!, which follows its subject as she records new music while battling cancer. Jones shared her Five Favorite Films with Rotten Tomatoes; perhaps not surprisingly, she’s got an affinity for musicals.The Great Debaters (2007)  80%I was honored to be in this wonderful Denzel Washington movie called The Great Debaters. I liked that movie not just because I was in it, but because I learned a lot from it. I didn’t know about&nbsp;the rich history of all-black colleges back in the 1930s.The Big Boss (Tang shan da xiong) (1972)  69%Bruce Lee got me to want to go see movies. We’d take the train in from Brooklyn to Times Square to go to the theater there. Back then,&nbsp;42nd Street&nbsp;was a much different place but was still an entertainment destination.The Jungle Book (2016)  94%I really liked the new Jungle Book movie. The animation was great and I loved seeing how that kid fit in with the animals. When I see animals around a watering hole now I think, “What are those animals saying?”What's Love Got To Do With It? (1993)  97%Truly one of my favorites. I really didn’t know all that much about Tina Turner&nbsp;—&nbsp;other than her music — until I saw that movie. Angela Bassett was fantastic and it really gave me a new appreciation for Tina.The Wiz (1978)  42%I really loved The Wiz with Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. I remember hearing that Stephanie Mills, who played the part of Dorothy on Broadway, wound up not getting the part. They had to change a lot of the details for the story to make sense for Diana Ross — that’s what got me interested to go see it. And then to see Michael and all the other stars in it. It was also really amazing how they transformed New York City into the fantasy world of an urban Oz.Miss Sharon Jones!&nbsp;is now playing in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"on, dc, Video, science, Fall, golden, south, TV, kong","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/03161523/sharon-jones-rep.jpg","slug":"sharon-jones-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827953286","title":"Michel Gondry’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Michel Gondry's Five Favorite FilmsThe director of Microbe and Gasoline chats about his new movie, the appeal of surrealism, and translating dreams to film.by Ryan Fujitani | July 8, 2016 |  CommentsFrom his innovative music video work for artists like&nbsp;Björk, Daft Punk, and the White Stripes&nbsp;to feature films&nbsp;like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Be Kind Rewind, French director Michel Gondry has consistently demonstrated&nbsp;a knack for dreamlike visuals and poetic sentimentality, and he’s earned quite a fanbase in the process. In 2004, Gondry took home an Oscar for his Eternal Sunshine screenplay, and the film remains one of the most beloved of its decade.His latest effort is Microbe and Gasoline, a small coming-of-age film partly based&nbsp;on his own adolescent experiences that centers on a young friendship between two outcast boys and incorporates touches&nbsp;of Gondry’s trademark DIY aesthetic. He was kind enough to speak with RT about his new movie, why surrealism appeals to him, and what films inspired him to become a director. Read on for Michel Gondry’s Five Favorite Films.L'Atalante (1934)  100%L’Atalante from Jean Vigo. I discovered this film when I started to have growing interest in movies. That movie is from the 1930s. It was shot with very little money, and the director was sick. I mean, it’s pure poetry. This movie, it’s a very simple story, and you have Michel Simon, who plays an amazing character. It’s just a great combination of a vision that’s close to surrealism and a Grecian film look. It’s extremely touching.Surrealism seems to be a hallmark of your films. What is it about it that appeals to you?Well, it’s sort of a freedom of expression. You don’t have to justify your choice, like you write an idea, and you shoot the idea the way it comes to you. So it reflects what’s in your head without the filter of intellectualization. It takes you to the most unexpected places.Groundhog Day (1993)  96%I would say Groundhog Day. It’s an amazing concept, but that can apply to everyday life, on the river of life. Many times, you say, you wake up and you have the same day. It’s a great concept that leads to a lot of sentiment and humor. And of course, Bill Murray is genius.Kes (1969)  100%I would say Kes by Ken Loach. It’s a story about a 12-year-old kid in the middle of England in a very poor area. He finds a kestrel – it’s like a small eagle – and tries to tame it. He goes to the library and steals a book about how to tame and educate a kestrel. And there is this scene – he’s always dismissed in class; he has nothing to say – and one time the teacher asks each pupil to tell a personal story. Every pupil has something really flat to say, and suddenly he stands up and he tells his story about his kestrel, and he becomes animated and he’s completely inspired, to the point that his teacher comes to see his bird.The Gold Rush (1925)  100%I would say The Gold Rush. I mean, I pick this one, but I love all the body of work of Chaplin. He takes some very dramatic moments or situations and he finds hilarious elements in it. And then, the choreography of the scenes is just amazing all the time. And I think the way he thinks influenced me. Not saying that I am Charlie Chaplin, but I think it was so inspiring – I watched all his films when I was very young, and I think it shaped my vision of film.My Little Loves (Mes Petites Amoureuses) (1974)  83%I’m going to say My Little Loves by Jean Eustache. It’s not an inspiration, but I thought of it when I shot Microbe and Gasoline. It’s the story of a 12-year-old kid who was raised by his grandmother, and then his mother takes him back, and she really doesn’t like him. His experiences in school – he’s trying to find a girlfriend. It’s shot in a very simple and honest way. And this kid was my age, so when I see him in the film in that location, it really could have been me. Jean Eustache was one of the greatest filmmakers in France, but he made maybe three or four movies.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;Much of Microbe and Gasoline is taken from your own life experiences. You’ve always made films that felt personal, but what prompted you to make such an autobiographical movie now?Michel Gondry:&nbsp;Well, I think that The Science of Sleep is as personal, but it was a present-time story that I was depicting. This one is from the past, from when I was 14. I always look for something to play when I do a movie, and sometimes it’s just because I want to do a movie and I’m looking for a subject. Also, if I do it about myself, it’s going to be easier, because I know what I’m talking about. If I talk about the present time, it’s just going to be about a director. So I go further in the past, and I end up looking at my adolescence.I explore details — there is some nostalgia, there is some trying to understand how I became who I am. Just to create an adventure that I wish I had done but I didn’t do. That’s one of the reasons to make a film, just to create a world in which you make things happen that would not happen in real life.Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;There are few directors who are able to capture the visual language of dreams quite the way you do, and to bring those visuals into the real world so seamlessly. I know that comes with a lot of experimentation, and I’m wondering if you’ve ever tried to bring something you had in mind to life, and couldn’t figure out a way to make it work.MG:&nbsp;Well, for instance, in The Science of Sleep, I didn’t want to have this hand-made animated universe for the dreams. I wanted to make them really real, with a lot of complicated digital special effects, but we couldn’t afford it, so that’s why I switched to something more hand-made, which probably was better. But yes, there are things you cannot do for scenes from dreams.Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;Speaking of dreams, do you — or did you ever — have recurring dreams?MG: Yes, I have many. And, as well, I have locations in my dreams to which I return. I can remember maybe 10 or 20 locations even when I’m awake that really exist in my head when I dream. I keep going back to them. In Microbe and Gasoline, there is a dream near the end, when they take the plane and the plane flies backwards, going higher at the level of the houses, and that’s a dream I have all the time.Microbe and Gasoline&nbsp;is currently playing in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"all-time, Quiz, Martial, drama, historical, zero, Hulu, Larson, movies, Films, italian, politics, Avengers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/08153450/Michel-Gondry-FFF.jpg","slug":"michel-gondrys-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508829537420","title":"Rock Icon Paul Stanley’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rock Icon Paul Stanley's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | May 23, 2016 |  Comments(Photo by Getty Images / Paul Kane / Stringer)&nbsp;You wanted the best? You got the best!The hottest band in the world is hitting the big screen for one night only, this Wednesday, with Kiss Rocks Vegas. Members of the Kiss Army will be flocking to the theaters, but even backseat fans and those millennials who may not be as familiar with the astonishment that is a live Kiss concert will have a chance to see the legendary show from the comfort of a local cinema.We had a chance to see an advanced screening of this blistering treat for the eyes and ears, but unbeknownst to us, the band itself was there to mingle, watch, and critique its&nbsp;own film, being the ultimate perfectionists one might expect. Not one to miss an opportunity to get a Five Favorite Films interview with rock royalty, we whipped out the portable recorder (which Mr. Paul Stanley himself nostalgically referred to as a vintage “Norelco”), and sat down to chat&nbsp;with the lead singer/guitarist/starman. Amidst exchanging inappropriate jokes with bassist/singer/demon&nbsp;Gene Simmons, lead guitarist/spaceman&nbsp;Tommy Thayer expressing the thrills of producing the film, and drummer catman Eric Singer interjecting comical&nbsp;banter about watches, cars and genitalia&nbsp;(Stanley joked that he was an interview “hijacker”), we were indeed able to get the sought after info: the&nbsp;movies that move Paul Stanley of Kiss.The list of mostly fun comedies may surprise you, coming from a band that flaunts self-empowerment, adventure, and explosive (literally) hard rock. While chatting in the Dolby Screening Room lounge, Singer, for example, asked if Stanley had seen Captain America: Civil War. The answer was an unapologetic no. “My problem with all of those films,” he said, “is as soon as they go CGI you lose me. All of a sudden I go, ‘I’m not watching a human being anymore,’ and you know it immediately. The movements are disjointed.&nbsp;From buying into something, I’m suddenly jolted out of it. I’m not a fan of CGI.” So what were his faves? Wonder no more, rock and movie fans, the answers are&nbsp;laid before you in this fine (and funny) collection of&nbsp;hard rock icon Paul Stanley’s Five Favorite Films:Kingpin (1996)  50%Great movie. It was one of the first films, I thought, that really took comedy to an absurd level. Whether it was watching Bill Murray’s hair that was a comb-over, [or when he] keeps falling over when he’s in a competition, or Woody Harrelson had a great scene where he’s playing an Amish guy and he comes in and says he spent the day milking the cows. He has this big pail, and he takes a drink and they go, “They’re bulls [laughing]!”There's Something About Mary (1998)  83%You know what? For me, life has enough bad news in it. So for me it’s either make me laugh or blow s— up.RT: That’s your philosophy onstage too.It’s my philosophy about life. There’s enough bad news. It’s very interesting because I remember I used to hang out with a lot of actors in the early 1980s because I thought that musicians were, for the most part, boneheads and had very little to talk about. So I figured, “Let me hang out with some actors, it should be interesting.” I found out – and I found this from spending a lot of time with them – most of them will tolerate listening to you talk just so they get their turn. So anyway, I remember spending an evening – I used to spend time with Christopher Reeve and a lot of really great New York based people. And I was saying how much I loved one of the Rambo movies, and he was kind of like wincing and really not sharing my view and he wound up as Superman. And Peter Weller was there a lot, and Peter winds up being Robocop. But for me it really comes down to — I went out with an actress at one point and we went to some foreign film and when it ended I went, “That’s it?” She goes, “Yeah, it’s a slice of life.” I go, “I don’t need to sit and watch a slice of life. I live life. Entertain me!” I’m not interested in some guy who has an affair and smokes cigarettes in a foreign movie so, for me, it really is make me laugh or blow s— up and do it well. So, Something About Mary, Kingpin…Trainwreck (2015)  84%I thought Trainwreck was great. I’m always surprised when a film makes me laugh out loud, and that’s such a wonderful, cathartic… I thought John Cena was hysterical in that.The Curse of the Werewolf (1961)  50%Curse of the Werewolf, Oliver Reed. Hammer Films. Hammer did all these fabulous horror films after Unviversal. Hammer really became the guardian of the horror genre and between Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, and Oliver Reed also, they did so many remakes and Curse of the Werewolf was terrific. There was a voluptuous vixen who winds up being thrown into a cell and getting banged by some questionable beast.RT: Another slice of life, perhaps?Yes! Yeah! And she gives birth to who becomes the werewolf. Curse of the Werewolf just because it’s a different genre.RT: We know Gene is huge into horror. KISS is sometimes representative of the genre; are you into horror films also?Well, we’re cinematic.&nbsp;I think what KISS did was take the normal screen to IMAX. We just opened it up and made the scope of it that much bigger and larger than life. But horror films per se, I enjoyed them when I was younger and enjoyed seeing Bela Lugosi play the Frankenstein Monster versus Lon Chaney, Jr. playing it or Glenn Strange or Boris Karloff. So, yes, I appreciated the movies, but at this point it’s more a nostalgia thing; I don’t really have a connection. Or the original King Kong. Or The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. There’s a great film,&nbsp;Women in Love. That was a British film. It was Alan Bates and Oliver Reed, an adaptation [of the D.H. Lawrence book].Zorba the Greek (1964)  80%There are loads of films that I’ve enjoyed. Zorba the Greek. Great! I like feel-good films. In Zorba the Greek you have this way of bringing these logs up a mountain – I don’t remember much – but the whole thing falls apart and it’s this huge catastrophe in the end and Zorba winds up dancing. It’s like, there’s nothing – what do you do? You dance!&nbsp;Kiss Rocks Vegas&nbsp;plays in theaters on May 25 only.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Amazon, women, Horse, Premium","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/10101009/600PaulStanley.jpg","slug":"rock-icon-paul-stanleys-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508829566097","title":"Sharlto Copley’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sharlto Copley's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | April 7, 2016 |  Comments(Photo by Getty Images / Chung Sung-Jun)&nbsp;This week, Sharlto Copley&nbsp;stars in&nbsp;Hardcore Henry, an action adventure — with a first-person perspective — on which he also served as executive producer. Copley made his debut in Neill Blomkamp‘s 2005 short film&nbsp;Alive in Joburg, which was eventually expanded&nbsp;to the hit feature adaptation District 9,&nbsp;and his career progressed with films like The A-Team, Maleficent, Chappie, Elysium, and the Playstation television series&nbsp;Powers. We were excited to talk to Copley about his Five Favorite Films&nbsp;(Superman II came in at a very close sixth):The Goonies (1985)  76%I definitely have films that, for whatever reason, had an impact on me.&nbsp;One of the first ones is The Goonies, which I watched when I was a little kid growing up in South Africa. I actually came home from watching The Goonies and planned a whole movie that I recorded on the tape recorder. It was&nbsp;about some kids in a gang. They stumble upon a stolen piece of art. It’s actually not such a bad idea now that I think about it. [The Goonies]&nbsp;was definitely one of those films that I distinctly remember pushing me into, “This is what I’m going to do.” I’d been playing around with the camera, but that was like the turning point for me, The Goonies.The Gods Must Be Crazy (1980)  85%The first movie I ever saw in my life, interestingly enough, was The Gods Must Be Crazy. It was a&nbsp;South African movie. It’s ironic that years later, the next most commercially successful film from South Africa after The Gods Must Be Crazy&nbsp;is&nbsp;District 9.&nbsp;The effect was kind of an&nbsp;early imprint that South Africa belonged in motion pictures. Because there was nothing else for years, as I became an adult — or even a young man — I kind of realized it didn’t. Everything that South Africa made was terrible that I subsequently saw. Usually I was just ashamed of it. I was like, “Oh God, we make terrible television, we make terrible movies.” And even with Marius Weyers doing the South African accent — something that was uniquely South African and African could be commercial was just imprinted in my brain.Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)  93%I think definitely Terminator 2 has to be in there. It was just masterful. The way [James Cameron]&nbsp;reversed the story for the sequel from the first one. I loved the first one, but I just thought… It was one of those rare occasions where the sequel topped the first movie for me.Dead Poets Society (1989)  84%Probably have to say Dead Poet’s Society, too. I’m a massive Robin Williams fan. Basically anything that he ever did.Beverly Hills Cop II (1987)  47%I was just a monumental fan of both Tony Scott as a director and Eddie Murphy. I suppose you can probably &nbsp;tell now — and especially by if you watch Hardcore Henry, the performance styles of Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy, and Jim Carrey, that type of performance —&nbsp;Peter Sellers,&nbsp;which was obviously a bit before my time — but as I grew up going back and watching that, I love those kinds of actors. It’s &nbsp;interesting all the sequels [I have] in here too [laughing].Hardcore Henry &nbsp;opens in wide release this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Wars, lord, RT, films, MTV, Writers, Trek","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/31160956/sharlto-600x262.jpg","slug":"sharlto-copleys-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508829562000","title":"Mekhi Phifer’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Mekhi Phifer's Five Favorite FilmsThe Star of Pandemic Tells RT about His Love for Aliens, My Cousin Vinny, and the Mobster Genreby Kerr Lordygan | April 8, 2016 |  Comments(Photo by Ethan Miller / Getty Images)&nbsp;An actor of considerable range,&nbsp;Mekhi Phifer&nbsp;has turned in fine performances in hits like&nbsp;ER, Dawn of the Dead,&nbsp;8 Mile,&nbsp;Soul Food, and Divergent. Starting on Apr. 5, he stars in the&nbsp;new sci-fi action film&nbsp;Pandemic.&nbsp;Phifer is also a completely charming guy who, after bonding with me about often mispronounced first names,&nbsp;enthusiastically talked about five of his favorite films (and then some). Do his favorites match with any of yours?&nbsp;My Cousin Vinny (1992)  86%My Cousin Vinny. No doubt about it. Classic movie, never have seen Joe Pesci or Marisa Tomei better. Everybody was great. The writing was great. It just goes to show you how character-driven movies are always the best, for me. I love character-driven, well-written, great storytelling types of films and I think that My Cousin Vinny just hit the nail on the head with everything.&nbsp;It’s one of those movies that, if I’m flipping through the channels, no matter what part it’s on, I can watch it. It’s just one of my favorites.Wag the Dog (1997)  86%Probably some people will go, “Huh?” But I love the film Wag the Dog&nbsp;with Robert De Niro, and Dustin Hoffman, and Anne Heche. It’s a really good movie — sort of political parody I think, that sort of played on what Clinton went through and how they have to sort of trouble shoot, and try to spin the story in order to get him, the president, re-elected and things like that. And even though it was a fictional story, to me it rang really true. And that’s another one that’s very character-driven. I loved every one of them, from Denis Leary to everyone, Willie Nelson… I just thought it was very well done.A Soldier's Story (1984)  92%Another one of my favorite movies in the whole world is A Soldier’s Story. It was originally a play but this one stars Denzel Washington and David Allen Grier and Howard E. Rollins.&nbsp;[It’s set] in World War II, it’s about the racial divide in the army, but it’s also about a murder mystery, but then it also dealt with the social class differences, and so that was another one that — [Norman] Jewison directed that; he really hit the nail on the head. Very well written, very well acted, another movie I could quote from top to bottom.Aliens (1986)  97%Number four I would have to say is the best one out of all of them:&nbsp;Aliens. That’s just one of those movies that I think was so well done. It was ahead of its time. [James Cameron] was just ahead of his time — it was so well written, so well acted. I loved the extended version of Aliens because it shows just a little bit more that you don’t see and what they always show on television.&nbsp; The drones shooting aliens, a lot of things like that, which I thought was great. I just thought Ripley was never better — I thought Sigourney Weaver was never better — than [when] she was in Aliens. Now Alien kinda had a slow start; you kinda had to get into it. These guys weren’t really prepared for [the] alien — some kind of breakdown with the crew, [that] kind of like reminded me of a play. But Aliens&nbsp;just kinda jumped in feet first man, and just went for it, absolutely. And by there being so many of the aliens it just heightened the danger that they all faced. You sat on the edge of your seat, you know, scared to death. So, I really love that movie.The Godfather, Part II (1974)  96%This is hard — to choose five — because there are a few in this genre that I really like, so I don’t know which one to pick. This is sort of going to be [from]&nbsp;an underworld, mobster kind of [genre]. So it’s either The Godfather II, even though I like all The Godfathers — I even like Godfather III;&nbsp;it’s just a different type of movie. But it’s between Godfather II and then also, there’s a movie that I did, and it’s not just because I’m in it — I love it — but it’s a movie called Paid in Full&nbsp;which happened to be a true story about these three drug dealers in the eighties who really made it big, and all this downfall happens. So I would have to put a couple of those in the fifth category. I would say Paid in Full, Godfather II&nbsp;— when Michael [Al Pacino] really grabbed the reins — and Goodfellas.&nbsp;And&nbsp;Casino&nbsp;—&nbsp;I was going to pick two of them, but I’m not. I would say Casino to me — I hated how Sam Rothstein got manipulated by Sharon Stone’s character in Casino. I mean, I just hate how he gets manipulated; that just gets ridiculous to me. I know it’s historic, but I hated that. So those are the three that I would put in as my fifth, in the genre of the underworld.The top of that list, I gotta go with Francis Coppola, Godfather II.&nbsp; Just for the epicness of it. And usually sometimes movies are long for no reason, but it was long for the right reasons, which is very rare. Usually, you’re like, “You could cut out twenty minutes of that,” but for me it was all story. To me, if I had to choose, I’d go with the classic Godfather II.Pandemic&nbsp;is now open&nbsp;in limited&nbsp;release and also available on&nbsp;VOD and iTunes.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Pictures, sequels, universe, Sundance, DGA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/07225134/mekhi-4-e1460070529462.jpg","slug":"mekhi-phifers-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831158435","title":"Gaspar Noe’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Gaspar Noe's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | November 5, 2015 |  CommentsGetty Images / Nicholas Hunt&nbsp;Gaspar Noe&nbsp;is known for making provocative films, but he says it’s not particularly easy&nbsp;to be provocative anymore, since nothing can top the outrageous and exciting themes of some of the films he grew up with. With his new film,&nbsp;Love,&nbsp;now open, and others like Enter the Void, 7 Days in Havana, and&nbsp;Irréversible&nbsp;in his filmography, Noe has certainly pushed envelopes of all sizes. But now he tells us which movies pushed his envelopes and, essentially, changed his life.Jason and the Argonauts (1963)  89%Jason and the Argonauts is the very first movie that I ever remember watching. My parents were living in New York and I was a very young kid. And I remember being in front of my TV all alone watching skeletons fighting with swords.&nbsp;For me it was magic. I guess the emotion was so strong that the memory of the room and the TV still piques my mind because maybe at that age you don’t really know what a skeleton is. But watching skeletons fighting was like, “Wooh-wooh, what the f— is this?” And I have a memory of that movie that sticks in my mind of the giant — there’s a boat that goes through the legs of a big giant. I have a lot of respect for those movies, like the old King Kong,&nbsp;which create a grand world with the tricks. I’ve always been respectful to all the people who do visual effects and special effects, because making movies is also making magic. You can also admire a man who pretends to cut a woman to pieces in a theater because he makes these images of horror that, again, don’t hurt. That was my very first memory of this film. And I was always going to see movies since then.2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)  92%When I was seven, my parents were living again in Buenos Aires, and they were going to watch movies all the time. Maybe that day they could not leave me at home because there was no one to take care of me, so I remember we went with my sister and my parents to see 2001.&nbsp;And we were on the first row of the balcony, so we were in front of the movie.&nbsp; And the monkey in front of the monolith, the tunnel of light at the end of the movie, the fetus floating at the end of the movie — all that happening in front of my eyes was, for me, like my very first drug experience — or transcendental experience — ever.&nbsp;I was blown away by the images. And maybe it’s a &nbsp;fake memory that I have, but I remember — during the movie, at that very early age — &nbsp;it seems to me that I liked it much more than my parents, because even then, when I talked about it with my parents, they didn’t really care much about 2001.And for me it became like an obsession. Every summer, or every two summers, the movie was replaying in some theater in Buenos Aires. And I would go again and again and again to watch it. Also because, for me, it was the ultimate image of what the future world could become. And I thought that when I would be maybe 30-40 I would really be living in a world in which it would be easy to go to the moon or do things like that. And to this day when I rewatch that movie, I feel it’s still representing the future in a very accurate way.&nbsp; Besides that, the dresses are very pop art.&nbsp; Since then I’ve seen it like 40, 60 times and I never ever get tired of replaying it.&nbsp; And sometimes even for New Year’s Eve, instead of going out partying, I want to start the year in a good mood so I just stay and put the movie on my DVD player.&nbsp;I know that that movie also — because it’s very tricky — I would say later in my life when I was a teenager doing mushrooms or taking acid, mostly it’s because I wanted to have the same&nbsp;impact&nbsp;in my brain that that movie had when I was a kid. And you can clearly tell that Enter the Void — it’s not an homage, but it’s a movie extremely inspired by 2001.&nbsp; And since then, I collect every single poster of that movie,&nbsp;every single lobby card.&nbsp; I have an obsession.&nbsp; I want to possess that movie, which is totally&nbsp;unpossessable.Eraserhead (1977)  90%When Eraserhead came out in&nbsp;France, it came out with the&nbsp;weird&nbsp;title, The Head to Erase. It was in French. I remember I was reading my parents’ newspaper — it was a socialist newspaper — and there was a whole page of how much this famous film critic didn’t like the movie. He was really trashing the movie. But the way he was saying it was very awful, disgusting, it made me — I was a 14 or 15 year old kid — want to go to the other side of the city and see it. And then it was like my own secret. And I went there. And I loved the&nbsp;movie so much, that I believe I went to see it four times in one month. Then after two weeks&nbsp;it moved to another city and I went to see it again in a screening with my friend. Then maybe one year later, it was replaying near my house at the&nbsp;midnight&nbsp;screening, so I went again with another friend. And for me that was the confirmation that cinema could also portray your inner world, that cinema could portray dreams and nightmares.&nbsp; And I hadn’t seen, at that time Un Chien Andalou by [Luis] Buñuel but Un Chien Andalou is one of the rare movies that is written in a mental language, a dreamt language. Eraserhead is another one.&nbsp; Kubrick said once that he regrets he didn’t have the idea to do that movie. In any case, it had such a strong impact on me that I would say Eraserhead — it made me get into film school two years later. Maybe it was a mix of 2001 and Eraserhead.I don’t know how many times I saw Eraserhead in the movie theater, but I guess it was maybe 15 times. I had an addiction to this movie, which is the kind of addiction kids can have to their mother telling them a story.&nbsp;You want to listen to the same story over and over, and have a hypnotic feeling and relaxing feeling. It created some kind of relaxing feeling in me. That I would enjoy all these movies — that are nightmarish– as if it were a dream, especially when the girl comes out saying everything is fine in heaven. There’s a fact also that David Lynch made that movie with almost no money over a period of five years. Then when I was doing I Stand Alone, I had a lot of money issues. I had problems completing the movie, then doing the editing, also. All the time I had in mind that David Lynch did that movie in five years.&nbsp; And I said well, “Maybe it will take me 10 years to finish the movie. If it takes ten years I’ll do it and I shouldn’t worry.”Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom) (1979)  71%Then I got into film school at the age of 17.&nbsp; Because I was young, the day I turned 18 my mother wanted me to see [Pier Paolo] Pasolini’s Salò.&nbsp;She said now you are old enough to see a precise&nbsp;portrayal&nbsp;of human cruelty. Maybe because my parents&nbsp;escaped&nbsp;Argentina&nbsp;during the dictatorship to avoid ending up in a torture camp like their friends ended up, she had a particular concern about the&nbsp;portrayal&nbsp;of human cruelty and torture. So she said, “You want to&nbsp;know&nbsp;how bad life can&nbsp;turn?&nbsp;Come with me and see this film.” And I saw it. And I know that movie stuck to my mind for, like, 12 years in a very precise, shocking way. And I&nbsp;never&nbsp;felt,&nbsp;for 12 years,&nbsp;the need to&nbsp;re-watch&nbsp;it. I said it was great to see it, but I was not ready to admit the perception of how bad people can be.&nbsp; It’s those very hot and cold — how do you say the people who study insects? -– entomologists.&nbsp; Sometimes you feel almost like an entomologist describing the life of ants. But the vision is sharp. The lesson is sharp. And also what I like about the movie is that, although the movie is about masters and victims, Pasolini — he’s not on the side of any. He’s just — like a dark situation, sharing the pain of one, or the dark joy, or the dirty joy, I don’t know.&nbsp; It’s almost like they’re above the character that they’re describing and they don’t identify with any particular one.&nbsp; You can also have that in The Battle of Algiers. But in any case, at 18, that’s a very major movie. I think nowadays that’s one of the very major movies in the future of cinema. It’s something strong that has not been copied in any way since. And that’s why, in my movie, I wanted to put Pasolini’s&nbsp;Salò&nbsp;poster above the bed, just to remind me that whatever I will do, my movie cannot shock, because of some people before us who made these extremely daring movies that really shocked their time. When people tell me I’m provocative I know that I’m not at all, compared to these masters of cinema.Angst (1983)  100%Maybe ten years later [after seeing Salò], I had written some shorts and I was talking with a friend who said, “Oh, have you seen this Austrian movie that has been banned in France for extreme violence?”&nbsp; That came out in VHS.&nbsp; And the German title was Angst. And the VHS was called Schizophrenia — the French VHS with French subtitles. And I tell you it was weird, it was like the beginning of some kind of new thing — that some movies could be banned for theatrical release but they could still come out on VHS. So I got the VHS. Nowadays there are maybe things that are banned out there, but you can find it with one click on the net.&nbsp;But this time, something that was banned could be found on VHS. I bought that VHS; that was quite hard to find. And I believe that I watched that movie 50 times because each time a friend said, “Let’s go see a movie,” I said, “Come to my house. I’ll show you Schizophrenia.” So one by one I was showing that movie to all my friends.And it’s got the most amazing camera work in the history of cinema.&nbsp; Not so many movies that really impress when it comes to the camera work. Maybe Brian DePalma’s movies… or 2001. Or, for example, lately, the images of Gravity.&nbsp; But the camera work of this movie is so real. It added to a very violent story of the guy coming out of jail and killing a whole family in order to go back to jail where he felt better, and it’s based on a true story. And it’s got a [unique] voiceover. But the mix of that cruelty, the voiceover and the camera put in positions that you’ve never seen before made me be obsessed with the movie. Now, since three or four months ago, it’s for sale [on DVD here in America].&nbsp; So if anybody is interested you can go on Amazon.com and buy that movie called Angst.Love&nbsp;is now open&nbsp;in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TruTV, Netflix, of, LGBTQ, travel, joker, FirstLook, stop, cartoon, transformers, Arts, canceled","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/04134212/GettyImages-494871468-rep.jpg","slug":"gaspar-noes-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831144094","title":"Adam Pally’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Adam Pally's Five Favorite Filmsby Beki Lane | December 7, 2015 |  CommentsPhoto by Mark Davis, Getty ImagesAdam Pally, of&nbsp;Happy Endings and&nbsp;The Mindy Project&nbsp;fame, is starring in the film&nbsp;Night Owls, about a guy who has to keep a girl awake all night after she downs a bottle of sleeping pills.&nbsp;We talked to him about his Five Favorite Films, but&nbsp;it quickly became evident that they could more accurately&nbsp;be called his “Five Formative Films.”&nbsp;Here are Pally’s picks:Being John Malkovich (1999)  94%I feel like that’s going to be a common one on a lot of these people’s list, but for me it’s just about the coolest movie I ever saw. When I saw it I was like, “That is so cool.” I don’t know if that was Charlie Kaufman’s intention, but I love that it was the real John Malkovich. I think that’s where I started to be kind of excessive with pulling back the fourth wall a little bit. Although, that might be a recurring theme with my movies, now that I’m thinking about it.The Producers (1968)  90%Number four, I would say is Mel Brooks’ The Producers. It’s a toss up between The Producers and Young Frankenstein. It’s so hard to pick one, but I just feel like the first production of The Producers with Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel is like … I feel like that raised me. That’s my daddy.&nbsp;Probably in the womb that was shown to me.Out of Sight (1998)  93%That movie is the coolest Elmore Leonard adaptation that there is. It made me read a book. I went and read Get Shorty after I saw that. That never happens. Soderbergh to me in that movie is at his … I mean, because everything he does is … He may be my most favorite filmmaker, but he’s at his most commercial and Soderberghian.&nbsp;He had just shot The Limey, and he got that out of his system, and he was dabbling; there was that weird Jackie Brown connection. It was just awesome. It’s just so good. He’s got my favorite line in any movie, when Dennis Farina leans over to Michael Keaton, who’s wearing a tee shirt that says, “FBI” on it, and he goes, “You got one of those that says ‘undercover?'” He’s on&nbsp;in Out Of Sight. He should have won a million Oscars.The Cable Guy (1996)  53%A lot of people will be like, “What?” but Jim Carrey’s best performance, possibly most grounded. I know that sounds crazy, but when you really think about the character, he’s amazing in it. Every frame he’s just electric. I could watch that movie a thousand times. I think it’s beautifully directed by Ben Stiller, who’s probably the best commercial comedy director of all time. I almost put Reality Bites on this list, he’s so good.It’s just so f*cking funny, and every scene in that movie is populated with the most genius comedic minds. Jack Black, Bob Odenkirk, David Cross, Owen Wilson — they’re all in that movie, and they all play hugely important small parts. They’re all amazing. It’s dark and f*cked up, and I just love that f*cking movie so much.&nbsp;That may be Judd Apatow’s best film. It’s so good, it’s so good.The Jerk (1979)  83%I just feel like that’s a movie that I saw when I was a kid, and you watch it over and over and over again, and you’re like, “Oh, Steve Martin’s doing bits, but they fit a story.” And it’s beautifully shot and directed by Carl Reiner, which some people don’t realize, and I just can’t think of a movie that informed my comedic personality more than The Jerk. It’s also a dumb character… it breaks&nbsp;all these stupid rules that Hollywood has for the sake of humor, and for the sake of jokes, and it’s a feel-good movie. Oh, man. I watch it over and over and over again.&nbsp;It’s got bits of Woody Allen’s kind of mysticalism, but it’s not. It’s jokey but the jokes don’t have punchlines. It’s like a Steve Martin album live, and they&nbsp;did a good job with making it a story. In a lot of ways you have no Borat without The Jerk, you have no anything,&nbsp;Lebowski; all those characters are Jerk-inspired. I play dumb quite a bit; I’ll say that right now. I don’t know if you call it a crutch, or what, but I tend to lean dumb… I don’t think I would have been able to get away with that had it not been for that movie.Night Owls&nbsp;opens in theaters on&nbsp;Dec. 4.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"razzies, satire","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04114154/GettyImages-1452587431.jpg","slug":"adam-pallys-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831106201","title":"David Goyer’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})David Goyer's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | January 7, 2016 |  Comments(Photo by Getty / Handout)&nbsp;David Goyer&nbsp;has a knack for writing and producing cool movies and TV series. He’s responsible for shows like Constantine, Da Vinci’s Demons, and Flash Forward, and his film credits include&nbsp;Dark City,&nbsp;Batman Begins,&nbsp;Man of Steel, the upcoming Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and The Forest, which opens tomorrow. At Rotten Tomatoes, we wanted to know what films make such a&nbsp;creator diverse work tick. So we asked him! And here are the results:The Man Who Would Be King (1975)  97%My all-time favorite film is unequivocally The Man Who Would Be King. I love the film. First of all, I love John Huston; I love Sean Connery; I love Michael Caine. I just think it’s one of the best examples of classic 1970s action adventure epics that I’ve ever seen and I don’t know how many times I’ve seen it, maybe a dozen times. It’s my favorite movie of all time.Being There (1979)  95%One of my other favorite films of all time is Being There. Hal Ashby [director]. Peter Sellers’ last film. I adore that movie. I think it’s profound, I think it’s funny, I adore Peter Sellers. I could watch that movie over and over again.Don't Look Now (1973)  95%One of my other favorite films is Don’t Look Now, which is kind of an antecedent or… something we were going for a similar vibe with our film, The Forest. I think, to date, it’s still one of the most disturbing movies that’s ever been made. I love how Venice is a very unique specific place in that movie. I’m a huge Donald Sutherland fan. I had an opportunity to work with him at one point and always loved that movie, and I was just gushing over that film. And I like its sense of stranger-in-a-strange-land, how it’s about a westerner that’s trapped in this very unique and specific environment, which is something we were trying to mimic in The Forest.Pan's Labyrinth (2006)  95%I have to say one of my good friends Guillermo del Toro’s Pan’s Labyrinth. I think it’s an incredible movie. One of the things I love about Pan’s Labyrinth is that the film could never have been developed within the studio system. It’s one of the purest expressions of a very specific and unique vision. It’s a horror film, it’s a social commentary film, it’s a dark fairy tale, and when you know Guillermo, it’s a film that could only have spawned from his imagination.The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (Les Parapluies de Cherbourg) (1964)  99%I’m going to cite probably a really odd one: The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Catherine Deneuve – it’s a musical in the 1960s, and I think that’s the best example of utilizing color and production design in a film that’s been done in the history of cinema. Basically it’s stunning and it’s a really delightful, buoyant film about love and friends. It’s just a beautiful, beautiful movie and probably not what your readers would have thought I might have picked. I use The Umbrellas of Cherbourg as an example of how color can inform a character’s internal head space. I’ve used that many, many, many times in my projects — I’ve pointed production designers, writers, and cinematographers to that film as an [example of how to use] color. It’s a cool movie.The Forest opens in wide&nbsp;release this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"007, Super, slashers, talk, winner, psychological, Paramount, Television, strong, TCA, police, space, Go, Winter","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/07215257/David-Goyer-Featured-Image.jpg","slug":"david-goyers-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508832287918","title":"Camryn Manheim’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Camryn Manheim's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | August 25, 2015 |  Comments(Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Marriott Hotels)Camryn Manheim is one of those trained pros whose appearance in a film or TV show is enough to inspire&nbsp;happy anticipation. Many of us recall her as the tough yet sensitive criminal defense attorney Ellenor Frutt on TV’s The Practice. We’ve also seen her on Extant, Person of Interest, Harry’s Law, and Ghost Whisperer,&nbsp;where she consistently delivered solid performances.&nbsp;But right now in theaters and On Demand, you can see her in the films Return to Sender and the Certified Fresh Cop Car. Also, you can see her in the Deaf West Theatre revival production of Spring Awakening on Broadway (previews begin Sept. 8). When discussing her favorite films, she, like the rest of us, had difficulty narrowing down her significant list. So the films mentioned here are just a small sampling of her favorites.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)  94%One of the first ones I remember my jaw being on the floor. You know, that idea of who’s running the asylum [laughing]? And who’s really crazy and who isn’t? It was a spectacular film to me. Jack Nicholson — it was my first [time] being introduced to him in such an unbelievable way, and he didn’t seem like he was acting to me. He seemed like a crazy man. And he wasn’t acting, because I’ve subsequently met him and he is a crazy man! All the characters were — you know, I don’t need to say it. One of my favorite films. And I’ve always wanted to play Nurse Ratched.Life Is Beautiful (La Vita è bella) (1997)  80%Life is Beautiful was a very big deal for me. Coming from a Jewish intellectual family, and also a family who was in love with the arts — and my sister’s an artist, and I’m an actor. Just mixing your brilliance with your imagination — just blew my mind, and I was fully swept up in the fantasy of Roberto Benigni and what he was able to accomplish in that story. I thought it was beautiful.The Shawshank Redemption (1994)  91%One of my favorite newer movies. It’s always been my favorite, but I don’t know how to tell you why. It was brilliant. And it was brilliantly acted and I was entirely taken by surprise, and I was in love with Tim Robbins. I was just in love with Morgan [Freeman]. I loved them so deeply. I loved them heated so deeply that — I can’t speak eloquently about it, Kerr. I love to watch movies and I don’t sit around and take them apart, you know?The Graduate (1967)  87%I kind of felt like it was just so complicated, finding yourself torn between a girlfriend and the mother was just so shocking to me, and so complex. I remember watching it, just being jealous I wasn’t involved in something so complicated and real — things that were never talked about. It felt so taboo at the time. It felt so brave. And I wanted to be in movies like that. That was a long time ago. I need to re-see that. Talking to you is making me want to revisit these movies.Primal Fear (1996)  76%I loved Primal Fear. It was my first introduction, I think, to Edward Norton. I don’t know what he was in prior to that. I love these complex storylines of scandals of the church and the greed of Richard Gere and then, of course, obviously that they fooled us for so long. I really fell down the rabbit hole and it turned on a dime and blew my mind. Frickin’ Edward Norton is such a genius. I hate to say this but I get jealous very easily [laughing]. If it’s a fantastic movie, or fantastic director or fantastic actor. Like, doing this play [Spring Awakening on Broadway] I remember [when seeing the original Los Angeles production] saying, “I’m jealous I’m not in it,” and that’s the biggest praise I can give. Honestly, I think Edward Norton is&nbsp;one of the best of our generation. I’d like to call myself in his generation.Return to Sender&nbsp;and Cop Car are open in limited release and On Demand.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"of, Marvel, King, song, kaiju, awards, Emmy, The, green, Extras, dceu, The, Watching, CBS, Tomatazos","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Camryn-Manheim-600.jpg","slug":"camryn-manheims-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508832280747","title":"Michael Stuhlbarg’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Michael Stuhlbarg's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | September 17, 2015 |  Comments(Photo by Jemal Countess / Stringer / Getty Images)“I love movies,” Michael Stuhlbag&nbsp;told us, when we chatted&nbsp;with him on the phone. He’s been doing what he loves since the 1990s, having starred in projects&nbsp;like&nbsp;Lincoln, Hugo, A Serious Man, Steve Jobs, Boardwalk Empire, and, opening this week, Pawn Sacrifice. He feels honored to be able to work with the folks he’s collaborated with thus far: “I love having new worlds and new filmmakers thrown at me, so I can learn more about human beings,” he said. “I think it’s a great window into human lives and it certainly makes me feel less alone in my own life, which is a beautiful thing.”We think it’s a beautiful thing that he loves the art of filmmaking so deeply, as demonstrated&nbsp;by his list of favorite movies. He obviously couldn’t name them all, but he made a point of expressing how influential filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese have been to his career, as well as more recent filmmakers like David Fincher and Paul Thomas Anderson. Here is the list.Cabaret (1972)  93%Cabaret from Mr. Fosse, initially, as well as Lenny — those two films seem to have made&nbsp;a very big impression on me. With Cabaret —&nbsp;I got a glimpse of it again on an airplane; it was offered in the classics section in the airplane that I was traveling in. And there were moments in that film where it seems he has created painting. For not even an entire second — or an entire half a second — you capture a glimpse of a “creature” that seemed to exist only in the world of a night club in Berlin in 1931. And it was still, but there was smoke coming up from the creature’s cigarette. Like the cartoons of George Grosz, there was a grotesqueness to some of the laughter, and he mixed what seemed to be an almost documentary-like reality combined with a very private story and also a kind of fantastical theatrical reality as well. The camera was always in fascinating spots, the sound creeped in, in ways that captured the subconscious level.Lenny (1974)  88%I loved that about Lenny as well — it combines this documentary feel and captures a spirit of who the true people were, separate from who the performer was. I love that sort of dialogue in cinema in general. It’s sort of the difference between the private and the public.A Clockwork Orange (1971)  86%I remember seeing A&nbsp;Clockwork Orange as a very young kid — probably too young to be seeing it — and there was something kind of dangerous about that world. It was like I know I should have been watching, but there was something about the style in which it was shot. Maybe it was how long the camera stayed looking at one thing, but it didn’t move very far. It captured a certain theatrical nature of something. There was almost a vaudeville quality to it all as well. I think I’m drawn to that because I have a love of theatre, and of pictures that are perhaps a little bit larger than life.Raging Bull (1980)  93%Mr. Scorsese’s stuff &nbsp;— I couldn’t watch Raging Bull Enough. I couldn’t watch Taxi Driver enough — every time it was on, I would just watch it. I couldn’t stop. I think there’s just, you know, being able to capture something that was real and something you just couldn’t tear your eyes away from. I don’t really know how to articulate it so much. These are all things that hit me young, and that’s why I’m talking about them now. Because they’re the things that opened my eye to movies and they are the ones that drew me to want to see more films. Almost like they chose me, and I didn’t really choose them, if you know what I mean. It’s like, they were put in front of me and I didn’t know what hit me. That’s more appropriate, actually.Reds (1981)  89%That’s a masterpiece that always moves me, every time I see it. I love epic films, I love epic theatre — bold, big stories, with intricate character work, but truth, you know? At the base of it all, something true. Whether it’s a raging spirit or style to the hilt.Pawn Sacrifice is now open in limited&nbsp;release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Women's, rotten, review, OneApp, Arrangement, spanish, President, 2021, on, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/rep-im1.jpg","slug":"michael-stuhlbargs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508832293041","title":"Peter Bogdanovich’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Peter Bogdanovich's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | August 20, 2015 |  CommentsPeter Bogdanovich‘s new film She’s Funny That Way stars Owen Wilson, Imogen Poots, and Jennifer Aniston, and harkens back to the screwball comedies of yesterday. For his Five Favorite Films, Bogdanovich chose movies&nbsp;along the same kooky, romantic lines that he enjoys watching over and over.Twentieth Century (1934)  86%Twentieth Century is a show business theater story, and Barrymore gives an extraordinary performance. Orson Welles told me that whenever he and Larry Olivier did a comedy, after seeing it, that he and Larry both were just doing Barrymore in the 20th Century.&nbsp;The Awful Truth (1937)  93%The Awful Truth is a great screwball comedy. It’s what they call a remarriage comedy. They split up for a stupid reason, and then the rest of the picture is how they get back together. Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, and Leo McCarey was one of the great comedy directors. He’s the one who put Laurel and Hardy together, among other great things he did.French Cancan (1956)  100%I always think of Renoir whenever I make any picture, and he made a comedy about show business called French Cancan. It’s set around the turn of the century, and Jean Gabin plays the guy who invented the Moulin Rouge night club. He did it by championing the return of the can can, and it’s a glorious film. Gabin&nbsp;was great and Renoir is my favorite director. It’s a show business story, and so is ours.The Lady Eve (1941)  100%The Lady Eve, written and directed by Preston Sturgess, with Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck. That’s a great movie.The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944)  86%This is a wild farce, it’s shocking that he got away with it in the middle of World War II. Betty Hutton gets drunk saying goodbye to soldiers going off to fight, and she gets knocked up. You never know what happened but everyone says let’s get married, because she’s pregnant. She has no idea who the father is. How he got away with this in the middle of the production code in the middle of World War II, I have no idea. Eddie Bracken plays a guy who’s so madly in love with her, he agrees to be the father. It’s a great comedy, really a farce.She’s Funny That Way opens in limited&nbsp;release on Aug. 21, 2015.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"canceled, comiccon, globes, talk, romantic, zombies, kong, competition, Mirror, Music, Diego, TLC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GettyImages-459492206-f.jpg","slug":"peter-bogdanovichs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831166630","title":"Matthew Fox’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Matthew Fox's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | October 21, 2015 |  Comments(Photo by Getty Images / Mark Mainz)&nbsp;For just over 20 years now,&nbsp;Matthew Fox&nbsp;has been a bit of a TV icon. On whichever six-year series you may have “met” him, be it&nbsp;Party of Five&nbsp;or Lost, chances are one of his characters was at the center of your pop-culture TV discussion at some point or another. &nbsp;Bone Tomahawk, a new western/horror hybrid film,&nbsp;continues Fox’s significant on-camera travails through the industry. When asked what his Five Favorite Films were, Fox shed light on just a small handful of the movies that make him tick. Here are his responses:Apocalypse Now (1979)  98%Ever since I read the Heart of Darkness for the first time — I really loved that book and loved the sort of question at the heart of that book, which is, “What is the true nature of the human species?” So Apocalypse Now is just an incredible adaptation of that concept and a movie that I never get tired of watching. There are so many interesting things in it.Unforgiven (1992)  96%I’m a huge fan of the western genre, I really am. I grew up on a ranch in Wyoming; from a very early age I loved westerns. Read a lot of westerns. Went through a period when Louie L’Amour was something that I just read tons of, then sort of moved onto The Virginian, and then movies. I just totally loved that genre. Been a dream of mine to be a part of one.RT:&nbsp;And now you are.Yes, it’s one of the things about Bone Tomahawk that’s so exciting.Drive (2011)  93%I loved Drive. Drive is one of my favorites, actually. Yeah, I would put that down.&nbsp; Stylistically, it was like nothing I’d seen in a while. The soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever — I loved the soundtrack — and the way that he directed that; there are so many interesting directorial choices there. Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan — their falling in love with each other, the kiss that is in that movie in the elevator, and then the violence that proceeds right after that. And it’s one of the most amazing movie kisses ever because you kind of sense that this thing is coming right afterwards, and it’s so, so brutal. There are so many elements of that movie that I think are really, really well done. Great movie.Blade Runner (1982)  90%Blade Runner goes down as one of my favorite movies and I have to watch it every opportunity that I get to watch it; and it seems to me that every single time I watch it, I discover something that I never knew was there. I mean, the fact that that movie was close to 30 years ago, it’s absolutely astounding. I actually watched it recently again and — you look at it now and it’s just — the set design and the way that thing is shot, it feels… it’s absolutely amazing. You can’t say that of some movies. Like, if you go back and watch Alien&nbsp;— the first Alien&nbsp;— it looks dated now. It really does, because of how much technology is moving forward and the kinds of things that are being done onscreen because of CGI. But if you go back and watch Blade Runner, it’s incredible how well it’s held up over time. It’s amazing.Trading Places (1983)  88%And then for something light and fluffy I would have to say Trading Places (laughing). Hilarious. Light, and fun, and hilarious, and a lot of laughs. I had to throw one comedy in there. I remember the first time I saw it — I don’t remember exactly where I was; I was young — I think the first time I saw Trading Places I was 15 years old, 16 years old, something like that. Eddie Murphy was just in his comedic prime; I think he came off Saturday Night Live not long before that. It’s absolutely a great premise and really funny, really enjoyable. I just loved it.Bone Tomahawk&nbsp;opens Friday, Oct. 23 in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"zombies, TV, medical, Bros., comic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fox-rep.jpg","slug":"matthew-foxs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508832308406","title":"Colin Trevorrow’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Colin Trevorrow's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | June 11, 2015 |  CommentsIn three short years, Colin Trevorrow went from directing a movie about traveling back to the past (Safety Not Guaranteed), to a movie about bringing the past into the present (Jurassic World). He writes:“I have a filmmaker friend who could murder a list like this. Five movies you’ve never heard of. Then, at the end, he’d mention a guilty pleasure, and you’d feel like a jerk because you haven’t even seen that. Every film that comes to mind is widely considered to be great. There are no discoveries here. All I can do is walk through my life so far and note the ones that shifted my perspective and defined the kind of filmmaker (and person) I aspire to be.”Pete’s Dragon (Don Chaffey, 1977)  56%&nbsp;You get 12 years of childhood, give or take. These days, maybe less. The movies I loved during that time have been well documented in other conversations, and they’re all the same as yours. Back To The Future remains the best movie I ever saw. Star Wars, ET, Indiana Jones, Die Hard, like everyone else. But Pete’s Dragon, though it may notentirely hold up to scrutiny now, was the movie that taught me how to be. I saw Elliott as a model for how to treat other people. He was generous and warm, but mostly seemed driven by the needs of whoever required him most. I’ve always been someone with a small circle of friends. Each stretch of my life has been defined by one person who was just my person. We became inseparable for a certain number of years, and that time was our season, just the two of us making our way through life. This was before my wife took the mantle, never to be relinquished. I had a similar dynamic with all of them — I wanted us to have so much fun, they’d consider their lives a little better for having been friends. Like Elliott.The Manchurian Candidate (John Frankenheimer, 1962)  97%In high school, I worked at The Video Room in Oakland, California. It had the largest selection of laser discs in the Bay Area. One guy owned all of them. I was smugly aware that most people were watching movies entirely wrong, and would tell them so. I’d explain aspect ratios and assure my friends they’ve never even really seen Jaws until they’d seen it at my house on the Pioneer, hooked up to my dad’s concert amplifier and massive stadium speakers, my own rig. I watched more movies during that time than I did in film school. The Manchurian Candidate was one of them, and it was just [on a] different level. I went in thinking it would be a masterfully directed political conspiracy thriller, which it was, but was also completely bananas. I couldn’t believe some of the choices made. That film gave me permission to get a little bit weird in my storytelling. Once you’ve seen an old lady execute a Korean POW while Frank Sinatra looks on in complacency, you know you can go to crazytown and the audience will stay with you. It’s not easy, but it’s possible.Annie Hall (Woody Allen, 1977)  96%Woody Allen movies are like Beatles songs. I can’t name my favorite without youimmediately naming a better one. But this one tops the list for me. It invented the modern romantic comedy while simultaneously deconstructing it. It’s skeptically romantic, like most of us. Like a child’s imagining of what adult life is probably like, it’s filled with the kind of hilarious nonsense that defined Woody Allen’s standup and early writing, which I also loved. I recognize the mastery of Crimes and Misdemeanors. And Manhattan. Hannah and Her Sisters. I was floored by Blue Jasmine, which I’d put up there with his best. But this one, man it just nailed a tone I’ve never seen again. I immediately applied to NYU with every intention of meeting a woman who wears a tie.L’ Argent de Poche (Small Change) (François Truffaut, 1976)  89%When I was first living in Los Angeles. I was in love with a French girl, now my wife, and I became immersed in the way her culture viewed life. There was a different set of priorities at work, a value of simplicity and pure ingredients, both in the food and the filmmaking. This film blew my mind. The cast is all children. It contains one of the great suspense sequences of all time: a toddler climbing out an apartment window trying to reach a kitten while his mother talks on the phone, ignorant to the tragedy at hand. Another vignette follows an older boy teaching a younger boy how to pick up girls. Very French, but so honest and pure. I remember watching the extras on the DVD of A Man and a Woman, another great film. The crew consisted of a handheld Bolex and a sound recordist, mostly natural light. Everything was in the eyes, the body language — just two people learning each other. It informed the way I made Safety Not Guaranteed. Stripped down, but not messy or ugly. Clear and audible sound, like what your ears would capture if you were there. Intimate. Real. The best.Cinema Paradiso (Giuseppe Tornatore, 1988)  90%I’m going to be honest, since it’s just you and me here. I’d considered this my favorite film for many years. I hadn’t seen it in maybe five. When I came back to Los Angeles after our short hiatus on Jurassic World, I woke up early the first day of pre-production, still on Atlantic time. This movie was on Netflix, so I sat up in bed in a very nice hotel suite and watched it. The movie starts with a filmmaker in bed in a very nice hotel suite, who proceeds to remember his childhood and relationship with a great mentor and friend. I cried for two hours. Straight. It all unpacked right there and then. I got to our production office and my eyes were still red, my voice was gone. My producer, Pat Crowley, sat me down and asked if I’d been on a weekend bender. I hung my head and gave him the least embarrassing of the two available answers. “Yes.”Jurassic World opens in wide release on June 12.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"2018, Society, comedies, green, criterion, TCA, concert, on, 2016, Adult, Shondaland, films","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Colin-Trevorrow-s-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"colin-trevorrows-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508834031800","title":"Kit Harington’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kit Harington's Five Favorite FilmsThe star of Game of Thrones and this week's Testament of Youth chats about his new film, working with Alicia Vikander, and admiring the real Jon Snow.by Ryan Fujitani | June 3, 2015 |  CommentsMost actors haven’t had the good fortune of landing a major role right out of drama school, let alone one that explodes into a global phenomenon, but that’s exactly how it happened for Kit Harington, best known as fan favorite Jon Snow on HBO’s Game of Thrones. Coming off a thrilling season five episode whose climactic action set piece found Jon Snow at its center, Harington next appears this week in Testament of Youth, alongside Alicia Vikander (Ex-Machina) and Taron Egerton (Kingsman: The Secret Service).The film is a World War I drama based on the memoirs of Vera Brittain, who overcame gender barriers and followed her brother and fiance to war as a volunteer nurse. Harington took some time to chat with RT about the film, his early interest in journalism, and how strange he thought the pilot of Game of Thrones was. RT had such a pleasant conversation with Harington that we lost count of his picks, so here are his Six Favorite Films:25th Hour (Spike Lee, 2003)  78%I’ll start with 25th Hour, the Spike Lee movie. It was actually written by David Benioff, who writes Game of Thrones. It was my favorite movie before I met David, and when I found out that he had written it, I proceeded to — when drunk in a bar once — to give him my version of the Edward Norton monologue that happens during the movie. Really embarrassing. I cringe to this day that I did that and gave him my rendition of it. It’s just an amazing movie. I love Edward Norton, I love Philip Seymour Hoffman in it, Barry Pepper, you know. It’s a fantastic movie.Romeo + Juliet (Baz Luhrmann, 1996)  72%Romeo + Juliet, the Baz Luhrmann version with DiCaprio. One of my faves; I thought it was an incredible take on Shakespeare. It was exciting, and DiCaprio’s performance in it is fantastic, and Mercutio’s Queen Mab speech is brilliant.Jurassic Park (Steven Spielberg, 1993) 91%I guess Jurassic Park is up there, just because it’s f—ing great, and I love it, and I couldn’t live in a world that didn’t have Jurassic Park.RT: What are your thoughts on the upcoming Jurassic World?Is it directed by Spielberg?RT: No, it’s not.Well, then I’m not interested. [laughs] No, I just think the original is one of the all-time greats, and it’s my favorite Spielberg.Heat (Michael Mann, 1995)  87%Heat, the Michael Mann film, almost purely for its action sequences. I watched it again recently, and actually, it really doesn’t work putting De Niro and Pacino on the same screen, doing a scene together, because they just try to outact each other. I didn’t like that scene, watching it again. I thought it was almost quite hammy. Their performances individually are incredible; it’s just that they… It’s almost too much acting to take.RT: Do you think that’s always a risk when you pair two iconic actors in a scene?I don’t know what it was. I actually think the dialogue wasn’t that great in that scene. You know, they’re two goliaths of their generation, and they’re so good because they dominate, really, in lots of ways. It’s like two positive charges going against each other. It doesn’t work. They’re amazing, but together, it didn’t work. That’s my opinion, although, it’s one of my favorite films.Some Like It Hot (Billy Wilder, 1959)  95%Some Like It Hot. I grew up watching that. It’s one of the ones we watch at Christmas at my house. Jack Lemmon is just wonderful.If… (Lindsay Anderson, 1968)  92%Oh, I’m thinking of loads now. I guess A Clockwork Orange. Wonderful film. And actually, on top of that, If… with Malcolm McDowell. If… before A Clockwork Orange, actually.RT: So you’re a Malcolm McDowell fan.Yeah, I once had dinner with him, and it was the most amazing thing. Yeah, I am, definitely. I think, as a young man, his eyes were just intense, man. He was great.RT: Did I read correctly that you were initially interested in becoming a journalist and war correspondent?Harington: Yeah, I was. I really respected certain British journalists, such as — actually, weirdly — Jon Snow, which is ironic, and John Simpson. I don’t know; I wanted to report on the world. And then I realized that maybe I wasn’t quite clever enough to do that. [laughs] I realized that maybe it was the performance aspect of what those guys were doing that was what I really loved. And I was doing more and more plays and drama, and I realized I wanted to be an actor.RT: With that in mind, was acting already sort of a side hobby for you, even as you were interested in journalism, or was it something you gradually transitioned into as you figured out acting was what you really wanted to do?Harington: I was taken to the theater a lot as a kid, so I grew up with it, and I always thought that I wanted to be something else. But I looked at a school report recently — you know, we’d have to write down what we wanted to do when we were older — and at the age of 13, I’d written quite clearly, “I want to be an actor.” So obviously all this war correspondent bulls— that I’m spouting isn’t necessarily true. Yeah, I think I respected what actors did, and I loved being the center of attention, really. Part of it was I wanted as much attention as I could possibly grab, and this was the best way of doing it.RT: Be that as it may, assuming you did have some interest in becoming a war journalist, how was it to sort of live that out, in a sense, in Testament of Youth?Harington: I did have an absolute fascination when I was younger, from age 15 all the way through to 20, with the First World War. I think a lot of young people do, because we’re morbidly fascinated with it as kids, and we’re also amazed that a lot of people our age went off and laid their lives down. But I also loved poetry, and I especially loved war poets when I was growing up, and when this came along, I knew this book very well, from studying it. So it ticked a lot of boxes of stuff I used to be very intrigued by and wanted to reinvestigate, I guess.RT: So you studied the book in school?Harington: Yeah, I’d studied it twice, and that can either turn you off a text, or it can really turn you on to one. Like, I remember I studied two things twice: I studied Testament of Youth twice, and I studied The Taming of the Shrew twice. I f—ing hate The Taming of the Shrew, but I really love Testament of Youth. I don’t know why that happened, but… When this fell through the door, I remember opening the first page and thinking, “Please be good. Please don’t f— up this part of my youth that I used to love.” And they didn’t, so I really wanted the part for that reason.RT: From studying the text twice over, was there anything you were able to bring to the role from that? Or was it too long ago for you to recall?Harington: It was a bit too long ago. I had to reread it, for example. I couldn’t remember a lot of it. But there was a book that was more important when doing this, a book called Letters from a Lost Generation, which was the actual recorded letters between Vera [Brittain] and Roland [Leighton]. So me and Alicia [Vikander] and also Taron [Egerton], who played Edward, we all had real insight into their actual words, thoughts, feelings, of these 19-year-old youths. That’s what really strikes when you read their letters; they’re kids. They’re falling in love for the first time, and it’s infantile and silly and full of testosterone and hormones jumping about all over the place. So that book was more significant for me in researching.We just had a really good time making this movie. You know, I was very aware of what a rising star Alicia was becoming — and Taron, but Taron’s movie [Kingsman: The Secret Service] hadn’t quite come out then; he had just come off this amazing movie, but didn’t realize how cool it was going to be — whereas Alicia, I had worked with on Seventh Son, and I knew she’d just come off Ex Machina. I knew she was a very interesting actress, and it was another reason I really wanted to do this, because I never got to share a scene with her in Seventh Son. It was great to be able to be in this movie, sharing scenes with her. Yeah, she’s phenomenal. She has a ferocity to her performance, which is great to work opposite.RT: Now, I have to ask you about Game of Thrones. It was your first screen role, right?Harington: Yeah, it was my first. I shared my very first screen scene with Peter Dinklage. Talk about “into the deep end.” [laughs]RT: When I spoke to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau a few weeks back, he noted that no one knew how big Game of Thrones was going to be. Looking back now, what is it like, knowing that your first screen role is now this huge global phenomenon?Harington: I just remember being incredibly excited that I was in an HBO pilot. That was all that mattered. If it got picked up, that was great, but all that really mattered was that I was doing an HBO pilot, and only a year out from drama school. The magnitude of that for me at the time was huge anyway. Whether it was going to be a big global success or not, no one could tell, and in fact, it very nearly didn’t get made after the pilot. It was almost canned, and I got a phone call from my agent saying, “Look, you should be prepared for this not to go. They’re probably not going to make it.” And it was a bummer, but it wasn’t the end of the world, because I didn’t realize what it was going to be.So then, it went, and then it was more of a gradual thing than I think people remember. The first season, people really liked, it got good reviews, but it didn’t really blast off until maybe the end of the second, beginning of the third season.RT: Nikolaj also mentioned that when he told his friends he was doing an HBO show, they were all excited until he described that it was a fantasy series with magic and dragons. Did you experience something similar?Harington: Yeah, kind of. When I first remember reading the pilot, it came through — and I think every young actor in the UK was going up for Jon Snow — I read the pilot, and I thought, “This is a really weird script.” I read it, and I had to read it again, just to get my head around what the f— was going on. In my head, I really didn’t know, like, “Is this genius, or is this just the worst thing ever made?” All I knew was that it was utterly unique, and you have to go up for those things that are utterly unique, even if they seem stupid. You have to take that risk, because at least it’s treading completely new ground. That’s what struck me. I look back and I love myself for that, for knowing there was something about this, because, you know, it could have been really bad. [laughs] Thankfully, my intuition was spot on this time.Testament of Youth opens in limited release on Friday, June 5.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"frames, Bros., streaming","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Kit-Haringtons-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"kit-haringtons-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508834050243","title":"Dave Franco’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Dave Franco's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | March 5, 2015 |  CommentsWhen asking Dave Franco, star of the new comedy Unfinished Business, about his favorite movies, we got some sexy answers. Read the list here where Franco, who also has starred in 21 Jump Street, Warm Bodies, and Now You See Me, discusses his enjoyment of sex in film, as long as it’s “classy,” and his love of horror.Stand By Me (Rob Reiner, 1986)  91%It’s probably my all-time favorite. Partially for nostalgic reasons, but mainly because I love movies about kids, when the kid actors know what they’re doing. I like the innocence of it, and the simplicity. I guess in a cheesy way, it takes me back to my childhood and messing around with friends too. It has a perfect balance of humor, heart, and intense moments as well.RT: When I watched it, it made me kind of wish that my friends and I would have found a dead body.I don’t know if I would go that far [laughs].RT: Out of the four kids, who was your favorite?The obvious answer is River Phoenix, but Corey Feldman is so great in it. He is so tortured — the character is so layered and he masks it so well by deflecting everything and making fun of everyone. I’m going Feldman.Boogie Nights (Paul Thomas Anderson, 1997)  93%Paul Thomas Anderson made a movie about the porn industry that feels smart and unique and appeals to all audiences, whether it be the toughest film critics or people who just want to go to the movies to be entertained. There’s so many great scenes in the movie, like Alfred Molina and the fire poppers. I just love this whole movie.RT: How old were you when you saw it? I was almost too young when I saw it, and you were young too.When I first saw it, I was more concentrated on Heather Graham being nude than the story itself. But it’s one of those movies where its appeal grows on you the more you see it.Y Tu Mamá También (Alfonso Cuarón, 2001)  92%Now that I say it out loud, I’m drawn to movies that revolve around sex but done in a very classy way, I guess [laughs].RT: They’re about more than just that.I re-watched this movie recently and it’s perfect. I’m not a very forgiving critic these days — I hate myself for it — but if I’m watching a movie that’s really great that has one scene that stands out to me as not working, it almost ruins the whole thing for me. I’m not proud of that, but this movie is one where every single moment — every single scene, or look between the actors, every line of dialogue — is just perfect.RT: How does Y Tu Mamá hold up in regards to Gravity for you?It shows what a genius he is, that the same guy can make this small contained road trip movie about these two friends falling for the same girl, and then make a huge scale film like Gravity. He’s one of my favorite directors. I love what he and Iñárritu and Almodóvar and Del Toro do; they’re all bringing something original to the table, which is what I appreciate more than anything these days. Even if something doesn’t fully work, as long as you’re attempting to try something original, I appreciate that.RT: You said the word road trip. That’s like Unfinished Business, right? Is there as much hot sex in your movie as there is in Y Tu Mamá?I wouldn’t call it hot sex. It’s definitely veering more towards awkward sex. There are strange sexual situations throughout this movie, and I think it’s stuff that you’ve never seen before on screen to bring some originality.Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock, 1960)  96%I love horror movies, I love thrillers. The majority of — and this is a blanket statement — horror movies don’t all necessarily have a good story or good acting or look particularly visually appealing. When a thriller or horror movie can excel at all of those elements, there’s nothing that entertains me more. Psycho is the ultimate horror movie — Anthony Perkins is a genius.RT: I just realized that your Unfinished Business co-star Vince Vaughn is in the remake.That’s right. I didn’t think of that, good connection.Being John Malkovich (Spike Jonze, 1999)  94%Being John Malkovich mashes different genres and spins everything on its head. Spike Jonze tends to do that — he’s got his own unique take on the world and I love it. He’s probably the number one director that I would love to work with. Charlie Kaufman is one of my favorite writers too. John Cusack is so good in that movie — just so sad but yet so funny — and Cameron Diaz killed it in that role too. That’s my favorite of hers. The fact that Malkovich even agreed to do the movie is such a fun element within itself. It works on many levels.RT: I don’t know anything about the writing of this or if Malkovich was on board from the beginning, but how gutsy was it to base a whole screenplay on one actor?Absolutely. I read that when one of the producers received the script, the first thing he said was, “Can we change it to ‘Being Tom Cruise’?” I just died.Unfinished Business opens in wide release on Mar. 6, 2015.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"spanish, Channel, shows, Emmy, travel, thriller, Polls, kong, Trailer, toy, kids, sequels","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dave-Franco-s-five-favorite-films.jpg","slug":"dave-francos-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508834033849","title":"Steven Seagal’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Steven Seagal's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | May 11, 2015 |  CommentsSteven Seagal is known for delivering stylized brute force in action flicks like Under Siege and Executive Decision, but he’s also an actor/writer/producer/director with a considerable career. While we wait to be served by the action icon again in this week’s Absolution, we caught up with Seagal to learn what movies make him tick, and his Five Favorite Films demonstrate a solid foundation for the films in his repertoire. See the list here.Regarding Henry (Mike Nichols, 1991)  43%&nbsp;Just how reality can, in the blink of an eye, completely change somebody’s life. And the transformation. [Great] performances.The Last Emperor (Bernardo Bertolucci, 1987)  89%Once again, how lives can tremendously overturn one’s life and, you know, go from the sacred to the profane, the black to white. We as human beings are really merely passengers who think we have control over the vehicle we’re driving but… In terms of grandeur — powerful, you know, the ability to really reach down and really grab your entire essence and move you — I think that The Last Emperor was truly a masterpiece in every way.The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972)  97%I thought The Godfather I and II were spectacular examples of wonderful storytelling, evolution of great characters and drama, amazing directing, Carmine Coppola’s spectacular music — I’m also a musician so I pay very close attention to music. I thought everything about [director of photography] Gordy Willis’ lighting… Of course, if we want to talk about lighting, let’s talk about Vittorio Storaro [director of photography] for The Last Emperor, breathtaking. [The two films] are sort of bookends; one doesn’t work without the other. It’s kind of the left and the right hand. I couldn’t really say which one was better to me, although in terms of creating a foundation, I think [the first one] was, once again, a masterpiece.Red Beard (Akira Kurosawa, 1965)  73%If we now want to get into films that — I arrogantly didn’t ask you if you would know anything about them; I just assumed, and assumption is the mother of all f—ups. Me, I’m Asian. I was raised in Asia and, to be honest with you, my favorite films of all time are really [Akira] Kurosawa films. He was a friend of mine. Yojimbo, Akahige meaning “Red Beard,” [and] Shichinin no samurai meaning “Seven Samurai,” I would say those are probably my three favorite films of all time. Even though Shichinin no samurai is the more famous one, I would probably pick Red Beard and Yojimbo.Red Beard is one of the most important movies in my life because it’s… I don’t want to say a movie about me, but it’s a movie about someone I tried to emulate subconsciously — or accidentally I should say — in that I am a martial artist, I am a healer, and I am a warrior, and those are the three kind of components that really make up Toshirô [Mifune]’s kind of character, you know? So I particularly relate to that movie on a very deep level.Yojimbo (Akira Kurosawa, 1961)  95%I also related to [Yojimbo] too because he’s a samurai who doesn’t really have to give a f— — forgive my French — but he doesn’t really care. He has [some of] the morals that I do in the sense that… Kurosawa is brilliant. He doesn’t really come out and let the audience know what Yojimbo’s doing. You almost wonder if he’s immoral because he’s killing all these folks and you’re not sure why until the end. At the end of the second act, you’ll see. You realize that both sides are evil, the whole town is evil. He wants to kind of annihilate all of them [laughing].RT: So it’s a question of morality and ethics.Well Kurosawa wants you to believe that, but certainly, he wants you, in my opinion, to think that Yojimbo is immoral until the end of the second act, and then you’ll see that he, in fact, is just a great Samurai, with real ethics, you know? That’s the way I take it.Absolution opens in limited release and on-demand on May 15.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"casting, political, Western, blockbusters, shows, Century, hollywood, reviews, south, The, Mirror","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Steven-Seagals-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"steven-seagals-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508835690699","title":"Dean Cain’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Dean Cain's Five Favorite Filmsby Catherine Pricci | November 21, 2014 |  CommentsBest known for his role as Clark Kent in the ABC series Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, Dean Cain comes from an entertainment family. His mother is actress Sharon Thomas Cain, and his father is Christopher Cain, director of films like That Was Then… This Is Now and Young Guns. So it isn’t surprising that Dean found success as an actor himself.Currently Cain stars in The Three Dogateers, about three dogs left alone a few days before Christmas who band together to thwart a couple of no-good burglars who have made off with the family’s gifts. We chatted with Dean about his favorite films of all time, and his love for the big screen truly shone through — particularly his love for Christmas movies. Read on to see what he chose.It’s A Wonderful Life (Frank Capra, 1946; 94% Tomatometer)It’s just awesome. What is there not to love about this movie? Donna Reed was amazing! My brother wants to marry Donna Reed. I’m like, “Dude, she’s a little old for you now.” I love the way he (George Bailey) was a happy guy but then can get cantankerous sometimes. Jimmy Stewart was just fantastic in that. I love the magic feel of it and I love the whole idea at the end of this person who did so much for everybody else and really stood on his own and sacrificed so much, that when he finally gave up and needed (help), everyone was there for him and I just cry every single time. I cry every single time.My brother actually says that I am that character in real life. I AM George Bailey. He’s like, “That’s you. You are that guy,” and every time I get ticked off when finally the pressure gets to me — because I do take care of a lot of people — he just yells at me, “Why do we have to have so many kids,” which is of course a Jimmy Stewart line. I even did It’s a Wonderful Life on a thing called “Fake Radio” where we did the entire radio version, on radio. It was great! So, I love that movie!The Godfather/The Godfather Part II (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972 / 1974; 100% / 99% Tomatometer)I’m a history major. I love history and I love the family values and to see how that whole story unfolded. Literally, if it’s on TV and I just watch it for a second, I’m drawn in immediately. The story is so compelling. I just can’t turn away.Braveheart (Mel Gibson, 1995; 78% Tomatometer)It’s got romance, it’s got national pride, it’s got good vs. evil, it’s got history — again! It’s just wonderful. Unfortunately it was a sad ending; I wish it (wasn’t). It’s based on history and William Wallace did go down and it’s a tribute to a good life, a changing life, and how education can change your life and travel and things and then he comes back to right the wrongs. Plus I did love the French queen, Sophie Marceau.The Princess Bride (Rob Reiner, 1987; 97% Tomatometer)Because I’m a softy. It’s magic, it’s funny, and it’s sweet and just great. I quote it all the time.Young Guns (Christopher Cain, 1988; 40% Tomatometer)That’s a cheat. I’ll cheat because my Dad directed it and I love cowboy movies and that was sort of a reboot of the cowboy genre because at the time, when he was going to make it, they (the studios) were like no, Westerns will never make money. And it comes out and it’s the number one movie out there. He’s a cowboy — my dad IS a cowboy — so he was the right guy to do that and he did it with a bunch of the kids I grew up with: Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen — those kids are just… It was amazing.The Three Dogateers is currently available on DVD and Digital Download.Click here for more Five Favorite Films.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Awards, festival, ABC, streaming, crime, Warner, visit, versus, lord, Diego, worst, Christmas, thirty","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dean-Cain-s-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"dean-cains-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508835686601","title":"Sarah Wayne Callies’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sarah Wayne Callies' Five Favorite Filmsby Catherine Pricci | January 12, 2015 |  CommentsBest known for her role as Lori Grimes on The Walking Dead and Dr. Sara Tancredi on Prison Break, Sarah Wayne Callies boasts an eclectic taste in film, and that’s what makes her list so fascinating.Callies currently stars alongside Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger in Black November, a based-on-true-events drama about a Nigerian community’s efforts to wage war against an oil corporation to keep their land from being ruined. Callies’ pure love for cinema shone through in her discussion about her Five Favorite Films: in reference to one of them, she said, “Who doesn’t love a drag queen? Dudes who wear makeup, I love it. Let’s go shopping.” Read on to see what she chose.&nbsp;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (Stephan Elliott, 1994; 93% Tomatometer)[It] would have to be up there for sheer enthusiasm. I love it for a million reasons. It’s just such a celebration. But I think I also — god not to sound like too much of a shrink — I grew up in a family with lots of divorces and things. Growing up, the first couple I knew that were really, truly like Disney movie in love and devoted to each other was a gay couple. And then one of them died — of AIDS — and I remember I was so young; I was in junior high when it happened. It was still at a time when gay culture was so judged and so reviled in so many places. The movie was such a celebration of song and dance, but also of a gay lifestyle, and it was a beautiful thing to see at that point in my life. For there to be something out there in pop culture that was celebrating and not apologizing [for] all of that — I just thought it was brilliant.Gabbeh (Mohsen Makhmalbaf, 1997; 90% Tomatometer)I’m about to sound like such a nerd. There’s a film I saw in college called Gabbeh. It’s about a Gabbeh — and I didn’t know this until I saw the film — it’s a kind of a carpet. It’s the story of this nomadic family that makes them, and it’s beautiful with all these amazing images — it’s very visual. I loved it and made my boyfriend at the time watch it — it was only like 10 minutes in. I did marry him anyway. [laughs] It’s amazing.Chocolat (Lasse Hallstrom, 2000; 63% Tomatometer)I loved Chocolat. The Lasse Hallstrom movie with Juliette Binoche — who’s perfect — and Johnny Depp who was at the height of being the unsung crush of my life.Isn’t he everybody’s?I think he is. I’d love to be more original, but the truth is I remember seeing him in Jump Street. I was like, “Yep, I’m in.”Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter…and Spring (Kim Ki-duk, 2003; 95% Tomatometer)There’s a film called Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter… and Spring. I saw it at the Angelika on my birthday in New York, maybe ten years ago? It never left me — it’s such a good film. It’s tremendous and beautiful. There’s like twelve words in the whole thing. It’s about a floating monastery in the middle of a lake. There’s like three people in it. That was amazing.In the Mood for Love (Wong Kar-wai, 2001; 90% Tomatometer)The Wong Kar-wai movie. If you haven’t seen it, you must. It’s beautiful, and romantic, and sexy, and impossibly romantic — did I mention? The imagery and the lighting is gorgeous. It’s a DP’s [director of photography] dream. I think I’m a sucker for images. I don’t really need the words as much as I just want beautiful pictures of places I’ve never been and things I’ve never seen.It’s the visuals. If you’re a visual learner, who needs dialogue sometimes?Yeah. I feel like a bit of an asshole saying that because I’ve just written a couple movies and I’m trying to develop a career in screenwriting as well, but yeah I completely agree. It was one of the things I loved about The Walking Dead pilot when I read it — that there’s like six lines of dialogue in the first twenty minutes of that pilot. I thought it was wonderful to have a movie [In the Mood for Love] that relied so much on what we see, not what we’re told.Black November is now open in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"cinemax, Arts, Guide","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Sarah-Wayne-Callies-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"sarah-wayne-callies-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508835701970","title":"Jeremy Renner’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jeremy Renner's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | October 7, 2014 |  CommentsJeremy Renner stars in the new drama thriller Kill the Messenger as Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb, a different type of hero than, say, his Hawkeye in Marvel’s The Avengers. Between spoonfuls of onion soup on an interview-heavy day, Mr. Renner took a few minutes to share with us his five favorite films. Here’s hoping the soup was almost as hot as these films; take a look:The Jungle Book (1967)  88%I love the music and the archetypes represented in the movie stick with me. Strong character. The characters just stand out as some of the best, and I love, love, love the music. There’s really good bad guys, really good good guys. I love it. Love it, love it. And it’s a cartoon so it’s one of those things that stuck with me as a kid and still watch it to this day.Do you remember what it felt like to watch it for the first time?I’d say Christmas, to me. The memory of, you know, dancing around with my dad, goofing around, he was pretending to be Baloo and I was pretending to be Mowgli. Then we’d switch roles and I’d be Kaa and he’d be, you know, Shere Khan. And it was awesome, man. It’s really, really cinematic and a big part of my childhood and now my big adult childhood.Anything that brings back good memories of childhood is always a good choice.Yeah, I’m teaching my daughter to learn how to play “The Bare Necessities” on the piano. Love it! And the themes, of course, are all great as they are in all those movies, and all the songs.Braveheart (1995)  78%Braveheart was another one that sort of encapsulates a lot of themes, and it’s very cinematic, it’s beautiful. I love the simplicity of that world, I’m a cowboy at heart. And I just love the idea of sort of, like, meat and hands and dirt and filth. I think the action was tremendous and violent and brutal. I thought the love story was delicate and romantic and beautiful and deeply felt. I love the sort of underdog themes: every man in his circumstance, these are things that sort of run deep in my body. The performances were great. I feel like if I was born in another era, it would be in that time or it’s a time I would like to be in. Really, really fantastic.A Clockwork Orange (1971)  86%A Clockwork Orange I’ve seen about 35 times. I remember first seeing that and I certainly didn’t get half the movie, but when I was young, I just thought it was just kind of weird and strange and I really appreciated it as I got a little older and saw it more often and more often. Then it became this sort of like a party background movie, something that just became part of my life. I certainly appreciated the language. Not profanity or anything but its own language, and the visual of it, I really appreciated the visual, because the visual is such a storytelling part of it and the language was so bizarre in its own kind of language. I really appreciate the work that goes into that.This is more like a highbrow sort of snobby film pick, but a sick demented sense of humor is kind in that movie as well. Ultimately it’s the visual storytelling and the language that I thought was so tremendous. It’s an absolute acid-trip fantasy weird thing. I never did drugs growing up because I watched Clockwork Orange enough so I didn’t have to do drugs. There’s a lot of shock value to it, but I really appreciated it for that. It was really kind of interesting for me and it all was put together in a very smart way, I believe. It’s not just sensationalism or anything like that because that kind of s— bothers me. But anyway, there’s a lot of things in that movie that I really like and appreciated.it really well in that film.The Shawshank Redemption (1994)  91%Simple storytelling at its best, character driven, beautiful and cinematic. The ending of that movie, if you’re not feeling good and your heart’s not twisted up and then melted back together then, I mean, I dunno, you don’t have a heartbeat. It’s one of the best feelings walking away from a piece of cinema. It’s all chalked up to really great characters. A really simple story, really. And that’s why I really enjoy it. It’s a beautifully… it’s a masterpiece. It’s a masterpiece of filmmaking in its simplicity. Its characters are lovely and tormented and flawed and beautiful and heroic. And I, again, love the themes of it.E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)  98%I remember going in, this was back when they had VHS, and you go to the movie rental place, and that was probably the last time I saw it, and ET was playing on the TV. I had to finish it there. ET came out and it would stay in the theater for, like nine months. Remember those days, you pay like two dollars, God I’m dating myself, but pay two bucks for an afternoon movie, and go see ET, and it would be there for, like, nine months. I saw it, probably 10, 15 times in the theater. Let alone the rentals afterwards. It’s just one of those things that encapsulates a time period in my childhood, when I had a lot of freedom on my bike and was allowed to go to the theater. It certainly is a throwback to a really good time in my life. Being a young man, coming of age. And, come on, it’s a classic Spielberg movie. It’s beautiful and the music, it’s great. Fantastic.It’s one of those where you go back and re-watch it to see if you like it the same way you did when you were a kid. That’s one where you always do.Yeah I’d be curious to watch that again. Obviously the effects are really going to kind of be, whatever, weird.I love the old school effects. And it was a much darker tone than I remembered. ET is so cute and cuddley now, but when you go back and watch the movie, it just looks darker than I’d remembered it.Yeah it’s pretty dark. The themes of it are dark.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"comedy, series, Guide, Sony, star","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jeremy-Renners-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"jeremy-renners-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508835691724","title":"Gina Prince-Bythewood’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Gina Prince-Bythewood's Five Favorite FilmsThe director of Beyond the Lights chats about her inspiration for the film and the state of hip-hop music today.by Catherine Pricci | November 13, 2014 |  CommentsFrom Love and Basketball to the The Secret Life of Bees, Gina Prince-Bythewood has poured her soul into her projects.Hip-hop and R&amp;B play a strong influence in Prince-Bythewood’s latest film, Beyond the Lights, a drama about the pressures of fame and the toll it takes on the world’s latest superstar, Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), until she falls for a member of her security detail (Nate Parker) and realizes there’s more to life than her career. Gina took time out from her busy schedule to chat with RT about her Five Favorite Films. Check them out below.Broadcast News (James L. Brooks, 1987; 98% Tomatometer)Holly Hunter’s performance. Her character spoke to me both personally and professionally. I saw myself in that character. It was hysterically funny, but also I love the kind of movies that make me laugh and cry and feel and it had everything. It’s almost a perfect movie.Out of Sight (Steven Soderbergh, 1998; 93% Tomatometer)The chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney was insane. Anytime that movie comes on cable, I can’t not watch it and it’s really because of their chemistry and the movie’s just fun. Don Cheadle is great in it. I love the story of it. I love the way Soderbergh shot it and I love the love story aspect of it.Central Station (Walter Salles, 1998; 94% Tomatometer)I saw that film and I don’t like to cry in movies — I don’t think anybody does — just because it’s embarrassing, but I was sobbing in that film. It was such a beautiful story. It was this little film that spoke volumes and emotions were just so real and it just moved me. And honestly, I saw it at a time where I’d grown up loving movies and there was a period where suddenly it seemed like everything coming out was the same and I started getting annoyed and then I saw Central Station and Life is Beautiful within months (of each other) and it restored my faith in film-making.Goodfellas (Martin Scorsese, 1990; 96% Tomatometer)I loved that film. It tells me so much as a director. I studied it so much in terms of the camera and how you use the camera to tell the story. The performances were great, but it was really the technical aspect of it that is so fascinating to me. What Scorsese was able to do with the camera to tell the story and speak to characters and give every character an entrance. It’s another film that’s almost perfect.Hoop Dreams (Steve James, 1994; 98% Tomatometer)A documentary that doesn’t feel like a documentary. It feels like a movie, a movie that I get lost in every time I see it. What’s amazing is if you had scripted it the way it happened people wouldn’t buy it and wouldn’t believe it. But the fact it happened that way in real life, it was mesmerizing and those two boys they were real and you rooted for them and you felt for them and you went through every emotion with them. It was so beautifully done and changed the game in terms of documentaries in making them more commercial and giving them a bigger platform than they had prior.Beyond the Lights is definitely a passion project for you; you got the inspiration for the story when you attended an Alicia Keys concert. Is that what drove you to using music so much for the movie?It’s definitely a passion project and I love music and I write some music, so it kind of makes sense that as a writer the story came into my head when I was at that concert. It doesn’t always happen like that for me as a writer when the story just comes but it was so specific and this character was so specific of a woman struggling to find her self-worth within an industry that takes pride almost in tearing thatdown. It just felt like it was right to explore and hip-hop/R&amp;B is such a complicated world right now and hasn’t been explored and putting a love story within that as well was fun for me as a writer. And I thought, honestly, it would be an easy sell, given that it was the music scene with a love story, and I was shocked that every studio turned it down — twice — but I believed in it and believed in Gugu ( Mbatha-Raw ) when I found her to play Noni.What hip-hop and R&amp;B influences did you have growing up?What is funny is that I was adopted by white parents and grew up in Pacific Grove, California, which had maybe six black people in the entire town. So, I grew up on Pete Seeger and Joan Baez and The Cure and The Who, and it wasn’t until I heard New Edition when I was in high school that it was suddenly like, “Wait, this is what I’m feeling.” I respect the music I grew up on — it definitely moves me, and Peter Gabriel is an artist that I love still today — but when I heard that New Edition tape and then I just played that tape, wore it out, and I just connected with it. Once I got to college it was all hip-hop and R&amp;B for me and it’s the music that I connect to and feel, but for the last couple years it’s really been moving into a dangerous, angry place that’s been trickling down into everyday culture. It scares me because I have two young boys, so I’m making this film in hopes that we can change the conversation.Hip-hop and R&amp;B in the 1980s and 1990s was so different than how it is now. It’s interesting how it’s evolved.It was fun and it was about the voice. It’s strange because R&amp;B used to be about loving your woman, and now its about hating women. You know, that doesn’t make sense.Beyond the Lights is in theaters now.Click here for more Five Favorite Films.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"jurassic, romantic, Arts, series, TV+, robots, Reality, scene, Legendary, true, lee, video, &, action, Day","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gina-Prince-Bythewoods-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"gina-princebythewoods-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508835678407","title":"Five Favorite Films with Rob Cohen","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Rob CohenThe Action Film Director Discusses the Films that Inspired Himby Kerr Lordygan | January 16, 2015 |  CommentsIt can be fascinating learning what films inspire the filmmakers who inspire us. In this instance, action film director Rob Cohen imparted to us five of his favorite films, some of which helped to manuever him towards a career in filmmaking. His The Fast and the Furious brought the once popular car-race genre back to the forefront of action films, and on Jan. 23, he’ll offer his take on another classically popular genre, the stalker-suspense film, with The Boy Next Door, starring Jennifer Lopez and Ryan Guzman. So hearing him discuss his favorite films elucidates why he jumped into making the types of movies that have made him famous. Do any of his choices affect you the same way?&nbsp;Gone in 60 Seconds (H.B. Halicki, 1974; 38% Tomatometer)I like films that really break every rule, where the director, writers, producers have gone out, they’re just going, “We don’t give a f— what the hell has happened in other movies, or how other movies were written, or other movies were shot. We’re just going to do it our way.” And those movies not only tickle my fancy, but they always give me a lot of courage when I should have to do something to go, “You know what? Be more like that. Don’t listen so much to the popular wisdom or the collective wisdom, the rules.” And that’s one of the reasons I’m so proud of The Fast and the Furious. It’s because nobody gave a s— about the movie except me and the cast, and so we didn’t hear anything. I just did what I wanted to do. I was very much inspired by the original Gone in 60 Seconds, but the H.B. Halicki version, not the other version. You know, because that guy was staging car chases on the Long Beach freeway with no permits, no anything [laughing] and he was clipping telephone poles and doing all sorts of stuff that was just so balls-to-the-wall. H.B. Halicki was a junk dealer who wanted to be a movie director. And he financed, wrote, directed and starred in the original Gone in 60 Seconds. That was such an outrageous thing that it stimulated me in many, many different ways.Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (George Miller, 1981; 100% Tomatometer)Same with my friend George Miller’s Road Warrior. When I first saw that in Westwood, I was like, “OooooK, there is a whole world beyond Hollywood that is sort of significant in this movie, that has a set of rules about gasoline as the ultimate currency that is both metaphorical and so out-of-the-box.” And the vehicles, the way George did it, the stunning performance of young Mel Gibson. I can remember the visceral impact that it had on me and I’m really looking forward to Fury Road now. I’m sure it’s going to be amazing.Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, 1994; 94% Tomatometer)After Gone and Road Warrior is Pulp Fiction, which I consider a perfect movie. I consider it a pitch-perfect movie. I’ve gotten to the point now where I pray to not come across it while channel surfing because, if I see five frames of it, then I have to sit and watch the rest of it. I’m now up to something like 30 or 40 times I’ve seen it. I just love that movie and all its dimensions, its crazy story structure, Quentin’s just brilliant dialogue, and the kind of mix of style and atmosphere with these memorable, memorable characters. Pulp is definitely one [of my favorites], although anything Tarantino would be good with me.True Romance (Tony Scott, 1993; 92% Tomatometer)I love Tony Scott’s True Romance. Tony was a good friend of mine and I miss him every day. That movie was not only, in my opinion, his best movie, that movie changed movies. It changed the way movies looked and, again, I think that script was written by Quentin.Yeah, it was. But I don’t believe he had much involvement in it after that.No, I don’t think he did. But Tony took that sort of subversive script and created a thing of such visual beauty and such compelling characters. You know, I gave Christian Slater his first leading role in The Legend of Billie Jean when he was 13.I love that movie!Oh! Thank you! [laughing]. [One of] Kerr’s favorites!I love that movie, are you kidding me? I used to watch that over and over again, when I was young.If you put that as one of your favorite films…Oh it’s probably up there. I still go around singing “Invincible” to myself whenever I think about the movie, and vice versa.Hey, fair is fair. And Monster Squad. I have my cult films.Irréversible (Gaspar Noe, 2002; 57% Tomatometer)Another one that I was very inspired by and touched by in all its ugliness and brutality, but its daring story structure, was Gasper Noe’s Irréversible, which is an odd one, but I just found the idea of starting at the end and telling it backwards as such a conceit. And the world it took you in, and the way it took you in, I felt that was something new that I’d never seen before.It’s a journey through hell, starting at the end and working backwards to the beginning. So it’s sort of Paris’ underground, and it has a rape scene in it of Monica Belluci that’s one of the most frank, most brutal… You know, people kid about rape, you just say, “Yeah, I think you should watch this movie and see what rape really looks like. You should see how violent and terrible it is and then you’ll not make any jokes anymore.” It’s so balls-out, this film. It’s so unafraid. It’s so in-your-face. It’s one of those movies that, once you see [it], you will never forget it, and it keeps coming back to you and back to you. It’s not necessarily a pleasant thing, but it was definitely a filmmaker who said, “I don’t give a f— what anyone thinks. Anybody. Not the critics, not my friends, not the finance producers, nobody. I’m just going out to tell my story the way I want to tell it.” Vincent Cassel is so great in it, and Belluci. It’s really a very powerful movie.Where are your light-hearted comedies, Rob?Well then I start sounding like a geek, you know? I love Preston Sturges. The Lady Eve is one of the most wonderful high-style comedies. My comedic taste runs sort of to that zone which, after the era of Judd Apatow, we’re not doing that anymore. Nobody’s doing the high styled sophisticated comedy.The Boy Next Door opens Jan. 23, 2015, in wide release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"video, miniseries, aliens, finale, drama, Awards, movies, poppins, WGN","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Five-Favorite-Films-with-Rob-Cohen.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-rob-cohen"},{"id":"47508837192927","title":"Patricia Heaton’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Patricia Heaton's Five Favorite Filmsby Sarah Ricard | May 8, 2014 |  CommentsIt’s fitting that Patricia Heaton’s new movie is called Moms’ Night Out — not just because it opens on Mother’s Day weekend, but also because, between The Middle and Everybody Loves Raymond, Heaton has become one of the most iconic moms on TV today.Having just produced and acted in a movie of her own, we thought we’d ask Heaton what her favorite films are. Getting the list down to just five was a task she described as “harder than having a c-section,” so seven will have to do.On the Waterfront (Elia Kazan, 1954; 100% Tomatometer)Every aspect of the movie is excellent. There isn’t one wrong move — from the script, to the acting, to the music. It’s such a beautiful human story about an individual struggle set against the corrupt unions screwing over the dock workers. So, you have this social background for the situation, and then you have the personal human journey of the brother of one of these union mobsters, who has to sort of turn on his own people. Marlon Brando pretty much rocked the cinema with this new style of acting, and you can never go back to Cary Grant. As wonderful as Cary Grant is, Marlon Brando changed the game. Karl Malden has one of the greatest movie monologues of all time as the priest in the docks, encouraging everyone to take a stand. He was like the first Norma Rae. I have the soundtrack on my iPod. I love great movie soundtracks, and I consider that one of those.What would you be doing while listening to movie scores on your iPod? You wouldn’t be working out to the On the Waterfront soundtrack, right?No, usually sitting in traffic in L.A. and trying to escape.Ordinary People (Robert Redford, 1980; 92% Tomatometer)To Kill a Mockingbird is way up there, but that’s also like an On the Waterfront kind of classic movie, also with a personal journey set against a bigger social issue — racism — but I’m going to go instead with Ordinary People, directed by Robert Redford with Mary Tyler Moore, Timothy Hutton who won an Oscar — one of the youngest Oscar winners I think — Donald Sutherland, and Judd Hirsch playing the psychiatrist. [Editor’s note: Hutton was 20 when he won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 1981 and still holds the record as the youngest winner in that category today.]I have seen that movie a million times. One of the worst parts was I saw it when I was really depressed in New York and it was running on a loop on like HBO or something and I just remember not being able to get out of my bathrobe and watching Ordinary People over and over again.I actually was at the Mark Twain Awards in Washington — the comedy awards for Neil Simon — and Robert Redford happened to be there because he worked with Neil Simon and so did I. And so I was able to tell him that Ordinary People was one of my favorite movies of all time. It’s a perfect movie. That too has wonderful music. It’s based on a book and it’s often very difficult to translate books to film and especially with such an internal struggle. Mary Tyler Moore [gives] one of the most brilliant performances I have ever seen of a very tightly-wound woman who’s trying to keep a good face on things. She’s just painfully tortured in that movie and it’s a hard role to do because she comes off as very weird and cold to Timothy Hutton, the surviving son — his brother had died in a boating accident and Timothy Hutton survived. For me, I know a movie is timeless when I can show it to my kids and they are enraptured by it — they’re glued to it and they’re following every plot point — and I knew when I showed Ordinary People to my kids, they would love it… The art direction in that [holds up] too. Mary Tyler Moore’s wardrobe you could wear today. It’s so classic and beautiful, and the house that they live in — it’s great. And the movie is just so moving and powerful.Ruggles of Red Gap (Leo McCarey, 1935; 100% Tomatometer)Charles Laughton plays an English butler whose British lord loses him in a poker game to a cowboy from Red Gap, Washington. Ruggles is the butler, a manservant, and he’s forced to move to America, and this cowboy doesn’t [Heaton goes into cowboy twang] feel comfortable having a manservant because it’s ‘Merica and every man is his own man and we have freedom. He tries to help Ruggles become a free man and Ruggles’ family’s whole tradition was being menservants to people. He finds it very hard to embrace American freedom. It has really funny, terrific, and moving performances, and not very many people watch it — or have even seen it or heard of it. I make my boys watch it every Thanksgiving. I’m like, “Boys, it’s that tiiiime!” and they’re like, “Noooooooo, not Ruggles.” but I think they’ll come to appreciate it.That’ll be on their favorite films lists…someday.Someday. Also, it’s a real treat for actors to watch. It has very broad characters, but they are so finely drawn that you go with it. What’s great about this is that they’re arch performances, but they’re really grounded in their weird reality. It’s authentic. It really works. You go with it. There are other ones that are probably more familiar to your readers, but it’s one of my favorite all-time movies and I’d like to throw it in because maybe someone who hasn’t seen it will take a chance on it.How did you discover that movie? It sounds hilarious.I think I just saw it years ago on AMC or the local public station. I think it was on a PBS thing and I just happened upon it, and I was so blown away. It’s one of the movies I like to give to writers on shows as Christmas gifts because they’ve never heard of it, and they all find it delightful.The Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming, King Vidor, 1939; 99% Tomatometer)I want to throw a shout-out to — I can’t decide. It’s between Woody Allen or Mel Brooks.How do you choose?You can’t. Bullets Over Broadway, The Producers, Annie Hall, Young Frankenstein. It’s really, really difficult. One of the movies I think is wonderful is one of the more serious ones… Crimes and Misdemeanors. One of the greatest. That whole era in the 1980s of the movies he was making was terrific. It’s hard to pick between any of those. That’s a whole category; I don’t know how to pull one out of there… And then I have three I don’t know which to pick between — and they’re very, very different — Zeffirelli’s Romeo and Juliet, All the President’s Men, or The Wizard of Oz.One of the reasons I say Wizard of Oz is because I had to watch it a hundred times because my boys really loved it growing up, and they would just love to get into bed and watch The Wizard of Oz. I watched it over and over and the more I watched it — you know, sometimes when your kid is hooked on something, you want to put a gun in your mouth for the umpeenth time they’ve watched Barney or Dora the Explorer — but the more I watched The Wizard of Oz, the greater it got. Then, for me, it also has the association of time with my children, so I think that’s part of the reason I have that on my list.Talk about a movie that holds up! How does Wizard of Oz do that so well?It has these wonderful actors in it and Judy Garland was such a gifted person. But there’s nothing else like it, and the songs were wonderful. I think when it came out, it wasn’t a great success, but it became a success over time. I think people didn’t know what to make of it, but it’s such a lovely fairy tale… When I was watching it growing up, you only saw it once a year. That only came on on Thanksgiving. It was a big TV event.That, and I think The Incredible Mr. Limpet with Don Knotts used to come on Thanksgiving too.Yes! That’s right! But I remember being so frightened of Margaret Hamilton in The Wizard of Oz, but it was so good that I could not not watch it. Walking up the stairs up to bed at night, after I watched the movie in the dark? I could barely do it. I had to run and get into bed. It took days to get over it. She was really, really frightening. It was a really well-done movie.Did you ever see Wicked?I love Wicked. I have friends who are producers of that show, Mike and Matt Rego and Hank Unger. It’s such a great retelling of that story. I didn’t expect anything because sometimes musicals can be sorta burdensome. I remember going to it, thinking, ‘It’s three hours long, my friends are producers on it, and I just gotta go, I have no idea what it’s about,’ and I was thrilled through the whole thing. Loved it.Romeo and Juliet (Franco Zeffirelli, 1968; 97% Tomatometer)Romeo and Juliet is on my list because I saw it when I was at a very formative age. I think I was 14 or 15, and at that age, girls are very dramatic about romance and they’re just starting to get those feelings, and love is very painful and very important. It’s overwhelming and you have these huge crushes, and so Romeo and Juliet is all about that huge first love. And you couldn’t have found two more beautiful teenagers than Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting… and that was the first time I had ever seen Michael York and he was stunning — he was stunning.The costumes were gorgeous. Zeffirelli was a beautiful artist. He designed theater and opera and sets, so it was just beautiful. I think why I love Italy so much now is because of that movie, and it made me fall in love with Shakespeare. That’s one of the first times that Shakespeare became not just some dusty old English thing that you had to study in school, but it became really alive. You know what else did that really well? Kenneth Branagh’s Hamlet… So, Romeo and Juliet was my first introduction. I walked around pretending I was Olivia Hussey. I had my long dark hair parted in the middle, and we had these, like, hippie baby-doll blouses that had the empire waist, so I would wear that all the time and I’d sorta stare at myself in the mirror. Of course, there was nobody in Cleveland, OH who looked anything like Leonard Whiting, so it was all in my head.All the President’s Men (Alan J. Pakula, 1976; 98% Tomatometer)And then there’s All the President’s Men.Are you cheating? Are you picking more than five?I’m sort of getting around to it.What’s amazing about All the President’s Men is that the only thing that happens in the whole movie is people make phone calls. There are no computers so they can’t look anything up — they’re looking up stuff in the Yellow Pages and they’re using, like, rotary phones. It’s Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford who are brilliant in it. They’re so natural. So, they’re making phone calls, they’re looking through files, and they’re having meetings in their newspaper’s editor’s office. That’s all that happens in the movie, and it’s as exciting as any big blockbuster movie. I mean, it’s really a huge accomplishment.It shows that it doesn’t matter what something’s about if you do it well.If you do it well — well-written, well-acted and well-directed. Absolutely.That’s a really funny observation about the phone calls.You can’t look anything up on the computer! They had typewriters! Typewriters! It’s a wonder any crime ever got solved.Tootsie (Sydney Pollack, 1982; 88% Tomatometer)I know we’re probably done, but I just have to say Tootsie is so wonderful and farcical… Feature comedy is very difficult to do. Tootsie took a crazy, ludicrous situation and made it utterly believable. You really believe Dustin Hoffman and the trials he had as a woman.Next, Heaton talks about her new movie Moms’ Night Out, and why pain is so funny.RT: So, let’s talk about Moms’ Night Out, which opens Mother’s Day weekend.With Moms’ Night Out, there’s a script that when we first got it, my husband David Hunt and I weren’t sure about producing it and acting in it. When we came on as producers, we got to get our hands in there and massage our characters and fill them out a little bit more. As an actor, you want to have something that your character is struggling with — something they have to overcome. So, we were able to add that in. Really, comedies are usually about pain. If you look at Tootsie, that was about an actor who can’t get a job; he’s in great pain. And then he falls in love with someone and he can’t reveal who he is, so he’s in constant struggle — and that’s what make it so funny.For Moms’ Night Out, all our characters are struggling. Sarah Drew, who plays Ally, is a mother of three young children, toddlers, and she’s overwhelmed and trying to be perfect. Probably, if I were to say what this movie is about, it’s really a love letter to mothers. As Salvador Dali said, you shouldn’t fear perfection because you’ll never achieve it. I think we need to throw out this idea of perfection — the perfect home, the perfect wardrobe, the perfect children who are speaking French and playing the violin and they’re math geniuses or whatever — and we have to let go of perfection and substitute it for appreciation. Live in the moment and appreciate the gift that children are, as tough as that job is. It’s the toughest job in the world being a mom.Moms’ Night Out is a great way to celebrate Mother’s Day because it really is a celebration of mothers — different mothers too. I play a pastor’s wife and I have a teenage daughter and my character’s whole issue is also this idea of always having to have a perfect facade. When I did some research about pastors’ wives, the number-one word they used to describe themselves is “lonely.”RT: That’s so sad.Patricia Heaton: I know, but doesn’t it make total sense? Everyone can come to them with their problems — and they do — but they can’t really go to members of the congregation and say, “My husband’s driving me crazy” because he’s the pastor. They have to keep their failings to themselves because they’re trying to keep up an appearance, and they have to make sure, because their husbands are the leaders, that they protect them… It sounds like a serious drama, but I’ve always found that the best way to tackle subjects like that is through comedy. Classic comedy is like you’re massaging a person’s soul so that they’re relaxed and having a good time, and then they’re more open to going with the characters and going on their journey with them.RT: As far as Moms’ Night Out goes, I know that when moms get to go out, it’s a very big deal.Patricia Heaton: My husband a few years ago said, “What do you want to do for your birthday?” assuming I’d say something like, ‘Let’s go out to dinner,’ and I said, “I want to go away for the weekend with my girlfriends” and he was so offended. But especially when you’re all moms of younger kids, it’s really hard to get away. For the last seven years, five of my friends and I have gone away. It started out going locally — we’d drive up to Santa Barbara or out to the desert — and then one year, I was doing a play in New York, so everybody flew to New York. And then for my 50th birthday, we all went to Hawaii to Maui, so I have not just Moms’ Night Out, I have Girls’ Weekend Away. Maybe that’ll be the sequel.RT: One of the things about the movie is that it starts out great for the moms, but it’s just awful for the dads.Patricia Heaton: I think that’s one of the reasons we have a hard time. We tend to complain about our husbands not pitching in, and yet we’re very reluctant to hand anything over to them because we don’t like the way they do things. You ask any woman and they’ll say, “It’s true. I wish he would help me, but only if he helps me in my exact way to my specifications and follow all my rules.”RT: He’ll do it wrong.Patricia Heaton: He’ll do it wrong. That’s right. And so Moms’ Night Out is really just a huge celebration [of mothers]. And it’s also something that you can feel comfortable bringing your own mother too.RT: Yeah, that’s a big selling point.Patricia Heaton: Yes, and it’s really funny.RT: One of the things that made me laugh was seeing Trace Adkins. He’s, like, twice everyone else’s size. He looks like a giant.Patricia Heaton: He’s amazing. He’s very intimidating because he’s a man of very few words — and the few words he does speak are in this huge, deep country voice. But he’s just the sweetest teddy bear ever.RT: Who knew he was a comedic actor? That was a surprise for me.Patricia Heaton: He’s wonderful! I just had a feeling. When we came on board, he was already attached and I thought, ‘That’s perfect. I know he’s going to be great in this. I just know.’ And he was.Moms’ Night Out opens this weekend in theaters.Click here for more Five Favorite Films.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"criterion, rotten, Cosplay, Lifetime, DC, cults, 2020, Stephen, rom-coms, BET, America, Toys, Syfy, Central","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Patricia-Heatons-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"patricia-heatons-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508837182681","title":"Richard Linklater’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Richard Linklater's Five Favorite Filmsby Sarah Ricard | July 10, 2014 |  CommentsDirector/screenwriter Richard Linklater has been a Tomatometer darling over the years. And this week, he hits 100 percent Certified Fresh for the second time with his new film Boyhood (the first time was Before Sunrise in 1995). Shooting his film over the span of a dozen years, Linklater captures the coming-of-age story of Mason (Ellar Coltrane), a boy who literally grows up before your eyes.To celebrate Linklater’s cinematic achievement, we asked him about the films that he loves. Tasking Linklater to list his five favorites is like asking him to describe his mood: the list will likely change in a day, or even in five minutes. “I once made a list of my 250 favorites — and that was just scratching the surface,” Linklater laughed. Still, as you go through the list of Linklater’s five favorite films (as they struck him at 1:30 p.m. EST on a Thursday in July), you will see how well they represent a filmmaker whose art is funny, sprawling, romantic, and radical — a body of work that captures a certain realness about the human condition, no matter what the genre.Some Came Running (Vincente Minnelli, 1959; 78% Tomatometer)It’s one of the great ’50s melodramas, and it’s kind of like a musical without the music, but it has a great score, of course. I saw it in my early- to mid-20s, and it just really affected me. It’s about a guy who goes back to his hometown where his brother is a prominent citizen. He’s a stalled-out, blocked writer, and he’s been a soldier, and a worker, and a would-be novelist, and he’s kind of a gambler and a drinker — this is Sinatra, of course, the conflicted one — and he lives in two worlds. Because he’s a published writer, he has the respect of the local English teacher and her brother — the respectable world of literature — but he really has a soft spot for bars and gambling and floozies and the Shirley MacLaine character. And then you’ve got Gwen French, who’s played by Martha Hyer, who’s the uptight school teacher. So it’s all these opposites colliding — respectability, debauchery… It’s wonderfully melodramatic and beautifully made… It’s about male friendship too. I consider it kind of the first Rat Pack movie, although it’s just Dean and Frank with Shirley around too. It doesn’t have a lot of the other people, but it’s the first one to capture these guys gambling and hanging out and that camaraderie. They become roommates and go on, like, a trip to Terre Haute, IN, to go gambling. It’s just wonderful.If… (Lindsay Anderson, 1968; 97% Tomatometer)The great British director Lindsay Anderson died 20 years ago and he only made five or six films, but they’re all very interesting, and I think his most famous is called If… It’s the film Malcolm McDowell did before A Clockwork Orange, and it’s kind of the ultimate teenage movie. It’s beautiful and very radical. It won Cannes that year, and it’s very much of its time, the ’60s, and Malcolm McDowell is brilliant in it. It’s the ultimate teen rebellion movie — and I like that genre — but it’s also very poetic, almost Brechtian, and there’s almost fantasy elements to it. Like, there’s this woman in the movie who might not even be real. It’s filmed in color and there are sections that are black-and-white and it’s kind of amazing. It’s the first film of a trilogy too. Malcolm McDowell’s character’s name is Mick Travis, and so a few years later, they did a film called O Lucky Man! and then ten years later they did Britannia Hospital together, Lindsay Anderson and Malcolm McDowell. So it’s one of the greater film trilogies in my opinion… It’s definitely worth watching. It used to be a bigger cult film in the ’70s and the ’80s, but I see it’s falling off. I don’t know if young people are watching it the way they used to.They’re watching Dazed and Confused.If… is much better. Trust me.The 400 Blows (Francois Truffaut, 1959; 100% Tomatometer)The 400 Blows by Truffaut is a real canonical film that everyone’s seen — and yet, there are still a lot of people who haven’t seen it! It’s Truffaut’s first film. He did it in his 20s, and it’s about a few days in the life of his young, 13-year-old hero, Antoine Doinel, who went on to do four more films in character. Truffaut, of all the great the directors, I think, had the most sensitivity toward children ultimately. He made this film, which is widely considered to be the best film about a kid, and went on to do The Wild Child and Small Change. He was just a good director of kids and this is one of the great kids movies — a young hero and his family life. It’s incredible.Nashville (Robert Altman, 1975; 93% Tomatometer)It’s the ultimate, sprawling ensemble Altman film — the way each character has their own story to such a degree, and he pulls it all together. It has these thrilling moments, these funny moments. The music is both very moving and satirical, funny and beautiful too. Keith Carradine’s song, “I’m Easy,” is a beautiful song, and some of the other songs like “200 Years” by Henry Gibson is hilarious. It’s just ridiculous. So, that you could have all of this go into one big collage where you have realism, satire, romance — it’s all there — is quite a feat. And I actually saw this when I was a teenager — fourteen or fifteen — and I was bored. I didn’t really understand what I was watching, but I saw it a little bit later, and it kicked off something else in me.Sullivan’s Travels (Preston Sturges, 1941; 100% Tomatometer)Let’s do Preston Sturges and the greatest comedy of all. This film hasn’t aged a day from 1941 when it came out; it’s amazing — especially with Hollywood in mind. It’s the ultimate inside Hollywood movie. It’s about a guy searching for meaning in his art who’s had all this success in Hollywood… The human dynamics of it are very true to life. I mean, it’s a comedy and it’s all pitched at that point, but Preston Sturges was such the master of dialogue and delivery that the whole tone and pitch of it is totally unique. It’s amazingly contemporary. This character’s desires and the timeless subject of, say, art versus commerce is one of the best film depictions of that you could ever find — and in a very comedic way. He has a project that the studio doesn’t want him to make about homelessness — this is coming out of the Depression — and he’s a spoiled rich guy and he has a project he wants to make. Of course, the Coens made a film with that name, O Brother, Where Art Thou? That’s where that comes from. And it’s kind of a ridiculous desire to say something that has social significance and meaning about suffering and all that stuff, but he’s really kind of desperate to make a comedy. He ends up on a chain gang by a series of misadventures… So he really is suffering. It’s just a brilliant movie and surprisingly contemporary.Boyhood opens in limited release this weekend, and it’s currently Certified Fresh at 100 percent on the Tomatometer.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Ice","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Richard-Linklaters-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"richard-linklaters-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508840928499","title":"Five Favorite Films with Dario Argento","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Dario ArgentoThe legendary Italian horror director talks about his favorite filmmakers, his take on Dracula, and the changing world of film criticism.by Luke Goodsell | October 11, 2013 |  CommentsDario Argento needs little introduction to horror movie fans. The former movie critic got his start collaborating on screenplays like Sergio Leone’s towering Once Upon a Time in the West, before launching his career in the 1970s with a string of giallo hits like The Bird With the Crystal Plumage, The Cat o’ Nine Tails and Deep Red, then crafting such cult horror classics as 1977’s Suspiria — a supernatural one-of-a-kind that cemented Argento’s reputation and brought his avant garde soundtrack composers Goblin to enduring attention. In the years since Argento has followed his own particular path, working with George Romero on Dawn of the Dead, introducing the world to Jennifer Connelly in Phenomena, and directing daughter Asia, herself a writer-director, in many of his pictures. And while his critical fortunes may have waned, Argento continues to be a revered figure among cinephiles and horror fans alike. With his 3D take on Dracula currently in limited release, we spoke to Argento about his career, film criticism and his favorite movies — which, faced with the rather daunting challenge, he instead turned into a discussion of his favorite filmmakers.Alfred HitchcockFor me it’s difficult to say five favorites, because I saw too many films. It’s better to say five directors, and why I love the films by these directors. Alfred Hitchcock, you know, most of his films were a great influence on my old films, also. Sorry it’s hard to pick individual films. It’s very, very difficult.Ingmar BergmanIngmar Bergman, from the beginning, was one of the most interesting directors in the world for me.Luis BuñuelLuis Buñuel. This was a great, fantastic, marvelous director. His fantasy and surrealist work was so great, but also the period that was very interesting was the period when he was in Mexico. He did marvelous films in Mexico, too.Michelangelo AntonioniMichelangelo Antonioni inspired me with lots of his films. He inspired many of my films, with the style and the philosophy of his movies. They were important to my films.Fritz LangAnd also, I don’t want to forget Fritz Lang, one of my favorite directors. With Fritz Lang, there were lots of different periods, like when he was in Germany and the the was in the United States; they were very different periods, and very interesting. He was an Expressionist and then his films were very frightening when he was in the United States.Next, Argento on why he made a Dracula movie, working with Goblin on Suspiria, and whether or not the critics understand his movies.Argento’s daughter, writer-director Asia, as Lucy in Dracula 3D.&nbsp;It’s curious that you’ve decided to do Dracula at this point in your career. What was your first experience of the character — was it the book, or seeing the films?Dario Argento: Especially the films inspired me. The book was just the idea for the films. I liked the films and the character in the films, especially the ones from Hammer. Those were very important and really inspired me. Those were a very different style. But this film, I do this film so different. I explore the other way of the character. He’s more romantic. There’s lots of fury, but romantic. Also, it’s possible to change his personality to become some other creatures. Especially it was very important because of the 3D, this new technology. It gave me this possibility to do scenery — the deep distance from the camera. Especially in the forest, we see a tree, and another tree, and another tree and then a house, and you come back in the middle of the scene — without the easy effects of things coming through the screen at the audience; this was not important for me. It was important for me to see the depth.Just going back to Hammer, your film shares some of that mixture where things are both very serious and at times campy. There’s definitely humor in your film.Yes.This is certainly the first film I’ve ever since Dracula transform into a giant praying mantis. Where did the idea for these insect transformations come from?Because I think with Dracula it’s possible to transform into a bat and a wolf and so on, so I think he has the possibility to transform into every creature — like a spider or bugs; every creature. The transformation, it’s natural.Did you like working with 3D?Yes, I liked it a lot.Would you shoot another movie in that format?I’m not sure. Because 3D needs lots of teams. Dracula was important for me. It’s a new technology to put the film in a new dimension. But I’m not sure if my next films are in 3D.There’s been a trend with some directors going back to their old films and making them 3D. Would you ever considering doing that with one of your movies?Yes. Maybe Suspiria. It’s a good experience to do in 3D.Jessica Harper in Argento’s 1977 classic, Suspiria.&nbsp;Speaking of Suspiria, it must be very pleasing to see that film take on such a life all these years later, with Goblin performing sold-out shows of the score recently.Yes, very much. Goblin doing the score is very great. They were very important to me. I think it was the best of the Goblin scores. The film was very much helped by the music, because the music put the film over the top — this kind of strange music, for the time, it was very unusual.I enjoyed Claudio Simonetti’s score for Dracula, too. Has your relationship changed over the years? I know the band composed the music for Suspiria before they’d seen the film.Usually we do the soundtrack before the film editing. During the shooting Claudio composes some music and then we see, because when the film is finished it’s too late. It’s better to do it during the shooting. During the shooting he comes and we work together on the film. At night he comes and finishes some music, and we speak about what’s good and what’s not and we might change something.He’s certainly produced some great music over the years. I wanted to ask you — you, of course, started way back as a film critic — do you have an opinion on film criticism today? How it’s changed, where it’s going — is it something that you’re interested in?Yes, I’m interested in it. Sometimes I write criticism for films. But now the criticism is too much just a description of the film and the story, and not so deep or profound. It’s not very important. Not culturally deep.So you think the cultural analysis isn’t as deep?Yes. The analysis is important. Some years ago it was better. Now it’s too light, too simple, the criticism. They write just the story, some words about the actors, and it’s finished. It doesn’t put the films in some movement. Films are many things inside, you know: the art and the color, and also the poetics and the ideas. Many things. But you don’t read this in the critics today.Looking at your career over the past decade, the critics have had different responses to a lot of your films than they’ve had in the past — and yet, when you go back to look at some of your older films that weren’t well-reviewed at the time, they’ve gone on to be reappraised. Do you think critics have missed the point of any of your recent films?I think some critics don’t understand my work and my films very well. But this is okay, because the audience response is much better for me. Critics sometimes don’t understand, or think that my films are too simple. It’s not too terrible for me. It’s okay. It’s what my life is.Time changes things, Dario; there’s always that.It does, yes. It does change things.Dario Argento’s Dracula 3D is currently playing in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Yoda, robots, Mary, Arts, spy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/da.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-dario-argento"},{"id":"47508839088358","title":"Five Favorite Films with David Koechner","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with David Koechnerby RT Staff | March 19, 2014 |  CommentsIf you need a good cinematic laugh, look no further than David Koechner‘s films. Among them are Semi-Pro, Paul, and Anchorman – The Legend of Ron Burgundy (whammy!). His latest film in theaters signals something of a departure from these comedies — which is a nice way of saying that although Cheap Thrills isn’t without laughs, it’s much darker than his usual fare. His Five Favorite Films reflect both of those sides of his personality.Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Terry Gilliam &amp; Ian MacNaughton, 1974; 97% Tomatometer)I saw it when I was 13 and it had an amazing impact on me, I couldn’t believe something was so funny and so smart. The level of writing is so crazy; it’s a continual inspiration. It blew my mind. I was at home babysitting my younger siblings. My parents were out dancing, and it came on at 1:30 AM. I would watch Saturday Night Live, and it was on after. I thought it was a horror film to start because it’s dark and there’s the pop-pop-pop and there’s smog. In the movie, that’s their preamble thing that I missed, so I didn’t know it was a comedy.Apocalypse Now (Francis Ford Coppola, 1979; 99% Tomatometer)It’s so epic and so well-acted, it’s got a literary lineage, and it’s just amazing. I was a fan of all the music, and it’s so well-used in the picture. I was always intrigued and fascinated by the Vietnam war and this made me feel like I was there. I was surprised by so many things about the reality of war. When Martin Sheen’s character is going up the river and he goes to this one place where they’re blowing up a bridge everyday and he says, “Where’s your CO,” and he says, “Ain’t you him?” and I was just like, “Oh shit.” And the other thing that still stays with me today, the way the character acted — the helicopter pilot that’s going down — he says “Mayday Mayday, we’re going down.” He doesn’t overdo it; he gives information that’s necessary for other people to hear, and so for me that was a big acting lesson. I didn’t know it at the time. Any other actor — he may have been a real pilot — any other actor would have chewed that up, screaming, “Mayday,” but a real pilot has to convey information to the tower. He goes, “I’m in trouble, I’m in trouble,” and that’s it.Hearts of Darkness makes that movie even better.That should be my next film. But instead…The Blues Brothers (John Landis, 1980; 87% Tomatometer)I’ll say The Blues Brothers. I love it. I just love it. I was 13 when SNL started so I was a big fan of everything those guys were doing. Belushi, Aykroyd, et al, so that was a movie I still love. I was on a tour bus last year and it came on, and I was just so delighted and blown away.Henry V (Kenneth Branaugh, 1989; 100% Tomatometer)I’ve never seen Shakespeare so easily digestible. Everything is so perfectly played and [Kenneth Branagh] is so wonderful. For me, it’s unparalleled. Every actor is just so fine tuned and so good. I love every inch of that movie.Man Bites Dog ( André Bonzel &amp; Benoît Poelvoorde, 1991; 75% Tomatometer)Man Bites Dog is a Belgian film in 1992. It’s about a film crew that starts following a serial killer around, and he’s charming and disarming and delightful, and he kills people with this film crew never interceding. The first time you see it, you’re like, “Wait a minute,” and you laugh a few times, and the second time, you laugh the whole time. It’s a bleak, dark comedy, but my god, it’s so funny. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before. It was before the onslaught of reality television, but it makes a perfect comment on it now. It had subtitles and I still loved it. I laughed so hard.Cheap Thrills opens everywhere this Friday.&nbsp;","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Paquin, Searchlight, Year, Trophy, competition, Pictures, impossible, ABC, heist, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/david.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-david-koechner"},{"id":"47508839111922","title":"Five Favorite Films with Tavi Gevinson","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Tavi GevinsonRookie editor and co-star of Enough Said on her favorite movies, making her acting debut, and the dearth of good teenage roles.by Luke Goodsell | October 15, 2013 |  CommentsIt’s hardly unusual for teenagers to catalog their obsessions on the Internet, but few of them manage to transform their personal blogs into buzzy digital superstardom — which is exactly what happened to Tavi Gevinson. The precocious pop fan was all of 12 when her blog, Style Rookie, captured the attention of cultural tastemakers, with the adolescent Gevinson feted by the fashion world and becoming the unofficial pin-up girl for eccentric teen girls everywhere. The site soon became a mini-phenomena that gave birth to Rookie, her hugely-popular online magazine written by teenage girls (and plenty of celebrity guests) for teenage girls. Now 17, Gevinson recently made her acting debut opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini in Nicole Holofcener’s critically-acclaimed Enough Said, and with the film still playing strongly in theaters, we had a chance to talk to her about her favorite movies and her thoughts on contemporary teen roles.Carrie (Brian De Palma, 1976; 92% Tomatometer)I keep lists of everything, and I have a list of my favorite movies; but I haven’t picked five, so I’ll just kind of go randomly. I have a list of 147 right here. That being said, not all of them are impressive — a lot of them are just musicals that I watched when I was younger.Don’t worry, this isn’t set in stone. My five favorite films would change in 10 minutes’ time. That said, this will be all over the Internet forever, so choose wisely.[Laughs] Well then it is set in stone. Okay, let’s see. The first one that really jumps out especially is Carrie. I’m excited for the new one but the Sissy Spacek one is so amazing. I think that’s because parts of high school or living in the suburbs are weird or sad or creepy, and I think that getting into movies like Carrie, or even like American Beauty, made me learn to appreciate that side of it.Carrie really takes the weirdness of high school to a surreal extreme, doesn’t it?Oh yeah. In the opening scene alone. I think it’s also just so beautiful. Sissy Spacek is so… she doesn’t look like a glamorous movie star; she looks like that girl in the back of your class that you’re a little worried about, and maybe scared of. It’s so creepy to me. I have so many friends who are like, well — movies like that or The Exorcist maybe don’t age well for us. Most of my friends think Carrie is just super-cheesy ’cause of the effects, but it’s still so creepy to me. I don’t think it has to be scary or have really mind-blowing effects to stay with you, it’s the story and the acting that are so eerie.It’s funny you mention the effects. I read an interview with Kimberly Peirce recently where she was asking Brian De Palma how he did the “pig’s blood” shot, saying they’d tried all these different angles and elaborate effects for the remake — and he said his production designer had simply pushed a single bucket off in one take.Really. That’s funny.I’m cautiously looking forward to the remake because of Kimberly Peirce though — hopefully she brings an interesting female perspective.Yeah, I really like her. I really liked Boys Don’t Cry, so I’m excited to see it. And I love Chloë Moretz and Julianne Moore, and I think, you know, the story is so classic that it doesn’t feel like a remake of an older movie, it just feels like a different take on a well-known story.Maybe your friends can get into this one, finally.Maybe. [Laughs]The Craft (Andrew Fleming, 1996; 50% Tomatometer)Okay, this movie… while we’re doing teen girls with supernatural powers of some sort…The Craft?The Craft! [Laughs] Yeah. That movie. Okay, one of my best friends and I, we watched it — I showed it to her in a kind of an “Oh, look at this so-bad-it’s-good, cheesy, ridiculous movie about teen witches from the ’90s,” but then we kept watching it, like every sleepover, and I think we both secretly really liked it and believed in it. All of our sleepover became The Craft-inspired after that. It’s just so… first of all, I think every one of those girls who’s in it has been in another really significant teen movie, like the girl from Scream, Neve Campbell, or the girl who was in the Gregg Araki film.Nowhere, which rules.Yeah. I forget her name.And Fairuza Balk in Gas, Food Lodging…Yes! And she’s so amazing. Wait, what else was she in?Gas, Food Lodging — it’s an Allison Anders film from ’92, where she and Ione Skye play sisters.Oh, I need to see that! I remember there’s like a special feature [on The Craft] where they’re talking about the scene where the whales wash up on shore, and it’s supposed to be like this big, supernatural experience, and they were all like “Yep” like they didn’t believe it, and then you see Fairuza talking to the camera and she’s like, “It was real — I could feel it.”Well, she was practicing magic in real life at the time. I think I had the same experience with The Craft, thinking at first it wasn’t very good — and then watching it over and over. It’s a classic — let’s just put that out there right now.Yep, absolutely. It’s a classic. I don’t know what it is about all these movies with teen witches but there’s just something about them. I think to watch that movie — and there’s an article about this on Rookie, where the author was like, “Girls are drawn to The Craft because they’re like, ‘Oh that’s a way for me to be powerful and I feel powerless,’ because high school is so awful and weird.” So I think that’s part of the attraction, is that you’re like, “Well, I don’t understand what’s going on with adolescence but I can have magic powers.” So, there you go.Incidentally, it also contains one of my favorite movie quotes — when they’re getting off the bus. “You girls watch out for those weirdos.”Yes! “We are the weirdos, mister.”I can’t tell you how many times that started off a mix tape.[Laughs] That’s brilliant.American Graffiti (George Lucas, 1973; 95% Tomatometer)Let’s see… American Graffiti. People have constantly been telling me to watch it, because they’re like, “It’s teenagers — you would love it, it’s high school,” and I never did. Then recently, on a flight home from Australia — which is, you know, a really long flight, and when you’re on a flight you have less oxygen and all of your emotions are heightened — I started watching it for the first time. And I was like, you know, it’s nice, but I feel like I’m enjoying it from a distance; it’s not really relatable, like “Gee, life sure was different back then and blah, blah, blah.” And then there was this scene between Ron Howard and his soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend — like, they’re in the midst of breaking up and they’re at the school dance, and then they’re called to slow dance in front of everyone, in the spotlight — and she just starts crying onto his shoulder and he holds her tighter, and she’s like “Go to Hell”, and I just started bawling.It wasn’t the lack of oxygen?Yeah, no — I don’t think it was the lack of oxygen. It was definitely for real.I kid, I love American Graffiti too. One of the great things about it is the sound design — it’s like a mixtape-as-movie, with that wall-to-wall sound.Yeah, oh for sure. I got the soundtrack on vinyl a while ago, just at a second-hand shop, and I was like, “I don’t know what this is, but all these songs are really great.” And then I had to find the movie.Grey Gardens (Ellen Hovde, Albert Maysles, David Maysles, Muffie Meyer, 1975; 89% Tomatometer)Okay, I’m gonna do something not about teens; except, for some reason, the best movies are about teens.The next movie had better be Cocoon.[Laughs] Well, in that case. No, I was gonna choose this movie anyway — Grey Gardens. It’s so good. When I was younger and did theater I was always either cast as a little boy or an old woman — I was never like an ingenue — but then I saw Grey Gardens when I was maybe 12 and I was like, “Oh, old ladies are awesome. They have it figured out — they do what they want.” And that somehow lead to an obsession — like, I started to dress kind of like a kooky grandma. It just seemed to be very freeing, in a way.It’d be cool to skip straight from being a kid to being an old person, because you get the best of both ends, doing whatever you want.Exactly! Cut out everything in the middle.Grey Gardens is a really great film.It is. It’s beautiful and it’s bittersweet. I just remember being very taken with the scene where Edie is singing along to the radio; or when little Edie is dancing around with the American flag. I hadn’t seen a movie like it before, because I was 12 and I hadn’t seen that many movies, but it was just very, I don’t know — at the same time, people were just starting to read my blog and I was trying to understand public attention, even in the small ways I was getting it, and I think it was good for me to see these stories about people who are very happy in their own world and by their own accord — although, in Grey Gardens there’s a little sadness, they’re filled with a little regret; but that wasn’t my takeaway at the time.License to Drive (Greg Beeman, 1988; 18% Tomatometer)I was gonna end with a teen movie — again. License to Drive?License to Drive? Okay, now that’s a curve ball.It is a curve ball. Let me explain! [Laughs] Okay, the driver’s ed program at my school, they showed us this movie — not as like a fun, Friday relax flick, but as, like, educational. I don’t know why, but there’s just something about Carol Kane and the husband — who plays him, Richard Masur? — it was so funny to me. I tried showing it to some of my friends, and none of them got why I thought it was so funny. I think I like it because it’s just so transparent: like, “We’re gonna make a movie, about a boy who’s learning to drive, and he’s in love with a girl whose name is Mercedes.” It’s so ridiculous. I just love it. What can I say.Next, Gevinson on her debut role in Enough Said, and why roles written for teenagers rarely get it right.&nbsp;I really liked your performance in Enough Said, it was kind of unusually adult for a teenage part. How did you get involved with this movie? Did Nicole seek you out?Tavi Gevinson: Well, I started seeing scripts a few months before I started auditioning for hers, and it’s hard to find a well-written teenager, I think — especially in a film where the teenager isn’t necessarily the focus. But there was something about this script where you have these three younger characters — me, Chloe, and then the two daughters, Julia’s and James’ — and they still felt fully-developed, even thought they could have been used as plot devices; there was still something about all of them that made them feel like more than that. So then I went on a road trip to LA, and the day after we got in, after three weeks of driving, I auditioned for Nicole. And Nicole hadn’t heard of me, and she recently told me that she expected a Carrie Bradshaw-type to walk in, which is funny. I was super nervous, but that ended up being kind of helpful for my character. Yeah, so that happened.When I called you an old soul earlier, I feel like a lot of that came through in the character — and that’s why Julia’s character gravitated towards you. What was it like acting with her. I mean, Elaine from Seinfeld!I mean… yeah. And the fact that she can play this and the vice president, and they’re so different. I’m such a huge Seinfeld fan as well; my whole family own all the DVDs, the whole nine yards. So I was really intimidated at first, but she was so warm. She’s just so relaxed and fun and just easy going; trying things different ways. I mean, it was an easy thing to do because we just had to be friendly and be in a house, and Nicole is also very warm and it just felt very relaxed. I was trying to soak it all in and learn as much as possible. Julia was full of a lot to learn from.&nbsp;You mention that it’s hard finding good teenage roles, and you’ve been reading a lot of scripts, so what are your thoughts on how teenagers are depicted in movies now? Are there certain things you see and think, “That’s wrong,” or “They got that right”?I feel like the biggest is — and because I run a magazine website for teenage girls, I see this in publishing for teenagers, too — I think that it can be condescending when people think that the common link, like the way to get through to us, is to use, like “Internet lingo” or some kind of stupid modern reference to technology, when really, you know… like Rookie, the website that I run, we have adult readers who say, “Oh, this is the same stuff that I’m going through as an adult.” I really just don’t think that teenagers and adults are maybe as different as people think, and so the best roles, to me, are treated like real people and not like these “crazy kids we don’t know what to do with.”You said it yourself when you were talking about American Graffiti: it’s a movie about the ’60s, made in the ’70s, and yet you found something in there that resonated with you.Oh, yeah. I mean, even, right now, I’m reading Susan Sontag’s journals from when she was, like, 14, and just the way she talks about — and this was from the late ’40s — it’s the same. It’s the same complicated feelings. And you know, there’s stuff like social media and everything that maybe throws in a couple of curve balls, but I think so many of the issues stay the same, and stay constant throughout generations.It’s why kids still watch The Breakfast Club.Oh, for sure.So, do you have plans to continue acting, and maybe even write your own stuff?I would love to do both of those things, but I have to apply to college first [Laughs]You can always apply to film school.Oh yeah, I’ll be doing some multi-tasking.Who would you most love to work with?Oh… I mean, I have, you know, my favorites — like I love Wes Anderson — but I also think that some people, you wanna just be able to appreciate their work as a fan. So I’ll just take it as it comes.Enough Said is currently playing in theaters.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Channel, Exclusive, cinemax, Awards, Walking, Talk, NYCC, Universe, razzies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fdsafdsf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-tavi-gevinson"},{"id":"47508839103727","title":"Five Favorite Soundtracks with T Bone Burnett","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Soundtracks with T Bone Burnettby Sara Maria Vizcarrondo | December 5, 2013 |  CommentsMusical multi-hyphenate T Bone Burnett is a whirlwind of associative thinking and snatches of wisdom. The Texas-born legend has produced the likes of Roy Orbison and Elton John, toured with Bob Dylan in his Rolling Thunder Revue, and frequently works as a score composer, music supervisor and a record label owner. Earlier this year Jeff Bridges honored Burnett in Nashville by calling him “the Willy Wonka of music, constantly creating new flavors for our ears.” If he had a conversation with sound guru Walter Murch, the velocity could produce a big bang.Burnett’s the executive music producer on the new Coen brothers movie Inside Llewyn Davis, his fourth collaboration with the Oscar-winning duo after The Big Lebowski, The Ladykillers and the super-selling O Brother, Where Art Thou?. “Everyone puts everything on a table and it becomes ‘ours’,” Burnett says of their collaboration. “Things shift and it just has to be whatever the best answer is and it doesn’t really matter who came up with it. You never feel there’s some controlling presence, they are just always the most certain participants — letting it happen — but they have a certainty that means you don’t have to worry about it.”Chronicling the offbeat odyssey of a struggling folk singer before his scene hit mass appeal, Llewyn has the kind of soundtrack that makes its music producer the film’s second star. So, in a twist on our Five Favorite Films feature, we asked T Bone Burnett about his favorite movie soundtracks…The Mission (Ennio Morricone, 1986)Yeah, that’s a good one.My Fair Lady (Various artists, conducted by André Previn; 1964)I’m not being funny. That song, “I’ve Grown Accustomed to Her Face,” I can barely make it through that song, it’s so beautiful. And “On the Street Where You Live,” the soundtrack just has great song after great song and it’s beautiful melodies and literate songwriting, just one great song after another.Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Various, score by Laurie Johnson; 1964)I liked My Fair Lady, though I thought Dr. Strangelove was a much more adventurous, subversive film that year, and should have won the Academy Award — listen to me talking like a Hollywood insider — but I loved that musical. So it beat Dr. Strangelove which is one of the most important films ever to me.Blood Simple (Carter Burwell, 1984)Strangelove was one of the reasons I called the Coen Brothers. I became a fan after their first movie [Blood Simple], because it had so much of my home about it — I’m from Texas and I knew people who’d worked on it. And it had a sound and style of storytelling I thought was great.Raising Arizona (Carter Burwell, 1987)And their next movie, Raising Arizona, came out and had this insane soundtrack. That crazy Pete Seeger “Ode to Joy” on the banjo with whistling and yodeling and it was totally mad. And every joke on it landed for me — one of the things about the Coens is there’s history in every shot. Some people say “Where do you want to put the camera?” but in the morning, they’ll draw up signs and give the actors with the lines and below a drawing from the storyboard of the camera angle they’ll be in when they have those lines. They have it all cut in their head when they do it. This is why they have control. Economy is the essence of art you know. I was looking at the detail in Raising Arizona and I thought, “We must have seen all the same films growing up because it was just speaking to me.” And it got to the part where John Goodman and his cohort come out of the ground and go into the service station to comb their hair and in the mirror you can see in spray paint OPE POE backward in the mirror. And I thought, “Really interesting this is how detailed they are.” They would take a quote from Dr. Strangelove like “Purity of essence, peace on earth” and put it backwards on a mirror and spray paint it on the wall somewhere backwards in Arizona.Inside Llewyn Davis opens in New York and Los Angeles this week and goes wide on December 20. Stay tuned for our interviews with the cast.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"America, comedies, PlayStation, Marvel, RT, TV, Century","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/tbone.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-soundtracks-with-t-bone-burnett"},{"id":"47509028528048","title":"Video: What Scares Tyler Perry?","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: What Scares Tyler Perry?by Grae Drake | October 19, 2016 |  CommentsRT Senior Editor Grae Drake challenged&nbsp;Tyler Perry, writer, director, and star of&nbsp;Boo!

Since then, she’s maintained a healthy career in television, earning praise for her performances in The West Wing, Pushing Daisies, and Glee. She’s even become a staple at awards shows, either as a host or, in the case of the 2013 Oscars, as a red carpet interviewer and performer.In Family Weekend, opening Friday in limited release, Chenoweth plays the snarky mother of a high-achieving teenager who takes her parents hostage to protest their indifference to her life. In an interview with RT, Chenoweth shared her favorite movies, and discussed the differences between working on the stage and screen and why she’s drawn to dark comedies.Steel Magnolias (Herbert Ross, 1989; 65% Tomatometer)Okay, Steel Magnolias. I have six aunts, and they’re all like my mom, and they’re all insane, but in a good way. That movie makes me think of them. And I’m also Southern, so it’s like, “Mmm, I get it.”The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont, 1994; 90% Tomatometer)I love Shawshank Redemption. Whenever it’s on, I have to watch it. I think it’s so well written and so well done. I love the story.Schindler’s List (Steven Spielberg, 1993; 97% Tomatometer)I’m kind of a weirdo; I love prison movies and war movies, which leads me into Schindler’s List. I think it really captured a moment in time that we aren’t proud of as a human race, and I just think [Steven] Spielberg knocked it out of the park.Inglourious Basterds (Quentin Tarantino, 2009; 88% Tomatometer)I like Inglourious Basterds; it’s another one of my top movies. I love [Quentin] Tarantino, and I don’t want to say I like violence, but I’m kind of like a dude in a lot of ways.The Sound of Music (Robert Wise, 1965; 84% Tomatometer)What was the other one I always watch when it’s on? Oh, this is dorky… This says everything about who I am: The Sound of Music. It’s just my favorite movie musical, and, I mean, it’s the reason I wanted to become a singer and an actress, was because of Julie Andrews and the Von Trapps. That kind of pretty much explains who I am, which is one big fat dichotomy.RT: It’s kind of cheesy in a lot of ways, but you can’t help loving it. I always get excited during the part where the nuns have sabotaged the Nazis’ car.KC: They have, like, the carburetor and… [laughs] The nuns are actually some of my favorite parts. I love it. I can’t help it. I just can’t help it.Next, Chenowith talks about her new film, the differences of working in film and on stage, and why she’s drawn to dark comedies.RT: What attracted you to Family Weekend?KC: Well, I was doing a Broadway show, Promises, Promises, and I got a script. It was about, basically, in a nutshell, parents who’ve sort of lost their priorities a little bit, and their teenage daughter kidnaps them to get their attention. So it’s extreme, and it’s [about] a family, and it’s a dark comedy, which I like. What I liked the most about it was the evolution of not just my part, but the family as a whole, and how they come back to what they used to be. It’s a bit of a crazy tactic, but there’s consequences to pay at the end, too, and I think that’s important to show. You can’t just, like, “Oh, I did this crazy wacky thing, and I’m not going to be held accountable.” I just thought it was really funny and cute, and I was looking for something like that to do, and I did it.RT: Looking through your filmography, you seem to have a thing for dark farces.KC: Well, you know, I think to play something that’s so not like you is obviously challenging and fun. Playing yourself… You know, I play myself when I do concert work and I tape my material and I’m just “Kristi,” you know? But taking roles, I’m going to look for something that’s probably not “the girl next door” because it’s too on the money. Even when I play “the girl next door,” there something a little off about them, and I enjoy that. Even when I look back at Pushing Daisies, you know, I was literally “the girl next door,” but she was… interesting. Certainly the role in Glee and The West Wing and GCB, they’re not the norm, and I guess there’s part of me that doesn’t feel… I’ve always been a little bit — it seems weird to say — a bit of an outsider, in a way? Yeah, so I can relate to that. I am a comedian, and I do like the comedy aspect, but I play dramatic roles, too. I think for now, all I can tell you is I’m looking for good parts, just like everybody else, and things that challenge me. So that’s what I do.RT: If someone held a gun to your head and said, “You can only do Broadway. You can only do movies. You have to pick something,” what would you choose? Do you consider yourself a Broadway person first, and TV and movie person second?KC: I definitely got my start [on Broadway]. It’s always funny to me when I’m in a mall and somebody will come up and go, “I didn’t know you sang!” I crack up, and I’m like, “What?” [laughs] But if I had to… I don’t want to [choose], because I really am about each part, I’m about the character. I’m more about that than anything, even the vocal. You know, I was more about playing Glinda in Wicked than I was getting to sing all the different styles. [But] I would have to say Broadway. I love live theater; I like the relationship between the show and the audience. That’s my comfort zone, but more than anything, it’s what makes me happy. But it is hard; it’s a definite way of life. It’s like, no life. Film and TV is no life in a different way; it’s “hurry up and wait,” but Broadway just isn’t for wimps. [laughs] I don’t know how else to say it.RT: Do you feel that when you’re doing a film like Family Weekend it’s easier because you’re not performing without a net like you are on stage?KC: It’s the pace that kills me in making a movie or doing a TV show. It’s the “hurry up and wait.” I actually love the work, but the amount of time we go from “action” to “cut” is so short, usually, compared to the waiting and getting ready, waiting, getting ready, waiting, ugh… That’s what drives me crazy. On the flip side, when you’re doing a Broadway thing, it’s all about stamina — rehearsal and performance — and that’s hard, too. And always trying to stay healthy and not get sick, because your name’s above the title, people won’t come to the show if you’re not there, or, you know, there’s pressure; you want to do the job. So, there’s the challenge, too, of waking up every morning and going, “How do I feel? Am I sick? Do I feel good?” They’re both hard; it’s just different hard.RT: You have a sideline doing awards shows lately. How does one prepare for that? Is it more of a spontaneous thing than working with a script?KC: Yes. Yes, it’s hard. I mean, it’s fun. I really didn’t want to do that, because I don’t see myself as that, because I’m an actor and singer, but for some reason I get inquiries to do it. I enjoy it — I’ve done the American Country Music Awards the past two years, and then, of course, the pre-show Oscars this year. [Singing a duet with Oscar host Seth MacFarlane] at the end felt like nothing, because that’s what I do. The interviewing, I’m like, “I give up.” Much respect to you guys to do it. You can prepare all the questions you want in the world, but the basic line is you have to be a good listener. You have to be a good listener, and then you have to be in the moment and ask questions that are appropriate. So, if I’m just being myself, just doing that, I’m better off than trying to become ultra-prepared. I mean, I do my own research and stuff, but I thought that was hard. I’ve never done anything like that before, like, on that level.RT: Oz the Great and Powerful has made a splash, so is there finally going to be Wicked movie?KC: Well, I mean, they better hurry up. [laughs] That’s all I got to say. Because it’s been 11 years since I played Glinda. I mean, at the rate that it’s going, I’d love to play Madame Morrible. I’ll just say that. Yeah, as long as I’m not a midget, I’m fine.RT: “Popular” is a pretty catchy tune.KC: I know, right? I’ve been doing it now for 10 years, and I’m not even sick of it yet. You’d think I would be.Family Weekend is in select theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Awards, Stephen, spy, Thanksgiving, tv, Pride, Studios, San, Spring, star, show","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dsaf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-kristin-chenoweth"},{"id":"47508840952061","title":"Five Favorite Films with Sarah Polley","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Sarah PolleyThe director of Stories We Tell also chats about her new movie, and the mysteries of storytelling.by Ryan Fujitani | May 10, 2013 |  CommentsUntil recently, multi-talented Canadian filmmaker Sarah Polley was probably best known for her early work on the TV series Road to Avonlea and later for roles in films like The Sweet Hereafter, Go, and Zack Snyder’s Dawn of the Dead remake. More recently, however, Polley has earned widespread acclaim for her two directorial efforts, 2007’s Away from Her and last year’s Take This Waltz.Polley continues her impressive work behind the camera in Stories We Tell, a new film that, while similar in theme to her two fiction narratives, is set apart by a couple of distinctions: it’s her first feature documentary, and it’s a decidedly more personal project, exploring the nature of storytelling by revealing a few secrets from her own family’s past. In a recent conversation with RT, Polley shared how difficult the making of the film was for her, why documentaries can never be objective, and what she learned about her family. But first, she gave us her Five Favorite Films, and here they are:The Thin Red Line (Terrence Malick, 1998; 78% Tomatometer)The Thin Red Line is my favorite film, and that’s probably the film that had the most impact on me as a human being. I feel like it really rescued me from a depression and gave me a lot of faith in people. I just thought it was beautiful. I saw it when I was nineteen or twenty. I’m a huge fan of Terrence Malick’s work.The Battle of Algiers (Gillo Pontecorvo, 1966; 99% Tomatometer)The Battle of Algiers is a film I just think is the most extraordinary accomplishment and such an effective political piece, and so beautiful. It completely bewilders me every time I see it, how it was accomplished.RT: Don’t you also have a little bit of a political spirit in you?I’m interested in politics and I have, at times, been engaged as an activist, so I feel like films that successfully deal with political issues in a way that isn’t too didactic are always really impressive to me.There Will Be Blood (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2007; 91% Tomatometer)There Will Be Blood is one that I adore. I think I saw it about four or five times in the theater. I just think Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius. I’ve never seen performances like that, and I’ve never seen something so thoughtfully and beautifully shot.Love and Death (Woody Allen, 1975; 100% Tomatometer)I love Love and Death by Woody Allen. It’s a movie that, if I’m ever sick or depressed, makes me feel better instantly.Three Colors: Red (Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1994; 100% Tomatometer)Red by Kieslowski. I love that whole trilogy, but Red, for me, was the most full film. I think it made me think about the world from new angles that I hadn’t before. I think I was about seventeen when I saw it.Next, Polley talks about the trickiness of crafting a personal documentary, and why she chose to tell the story in such an inventive way.RT: Stories We Tell was a difficult film for you to make, and I understand there were several points when you almost gave up. What kept you going?Sarah Polley: I don’t really know, to be honest. I think, probably a sense of obligation because I’d already spent a lot of money on the film, and probably should keep going because the National Film Board (NFB) was counting on me. [laughs] And the collaborators I was working with were so inspiring and amazing and challenging, and I felt like they were pushing me further than I’d ever gone artistically. I felt like I wanted to keep working with them, so while the subject matter and the process of making the film was at times really claustrophobic and difficult, I did feel like it was worth it to keep collaborating with them — The NFB, and my cinematographer Iris [Ng], and my editor Mike [Munn]. It just made it feel worthwhile even if it was kind of a painful process.RT: This is a documentary that starts out feeling like a memorial or tribute to your late mother, but eventually becomes an exploration of memory and mythmaking and storytelling. It’s kind of a heady topic couched within a fascinating personal story. In a blog post on the NFB’s website, you mentioned that personal documentaries tend to make you “squeamish.” What steps did you take to try and avoid that with Stories We Tell?SP: I think the truth is that I wasn’t interested in making the film about the story itself. It was about a year and a half after the events that I even began to think about making this into a film. I think that, for me, the way I was able to make a film about my own life was that I was really interested in making a film about storytelling and about memory, and in a way, I had to use my family story to illustrate something that I thought was more universal about why we tell stories, and why we so desperately need to create narrative out of the kind of mess of our lives. That was what made me interested in making the film.There are some personal docs that I really love. I wasn’t interested in making a traditional personal doc, with, you know, voiceovers stating all my feelings, but it obviously needed to use this sort of personal story to talk about the larger issues I was interested in, which were really about why we tell stories.RT: Is that part of the reason why we only get small snippets of your voice here?SP: I think that is why, and I also felt like, for me, it was… In a way, my own version was not interesting to me, and in a strange way, I thought it wouldn’t be that interesting to other people either, because I think what was interesting was the cacophony of all the voices, and trying to find what could be accurate — what could be true — and what could be false in the middle of all that. I also felt like there would be a real injustice to both being the person who is constructing the film and editing the film and making all of those kinds of decisions, and also including my version alongside everybody else’s as though it was going to be equally viewed. I think it would have automatically kind of superseded the other versions, which felt kind of tyrannical or something. [laughs]RT: You do a great job of parceling out little bits of information that slowly reveal the bigger picture. As a storyteller here yourself, how do you go about deciding effectively what to reveal and when?SP: I think that was a long process of making decisions. The original structure for the film was very, sort of, Rashomon-esque, where it was going to be me telling my version, my dad telling his version, Harry [Gulkin] telling his version. We weren’t going to keep any secrets; you would know the story off the bat. It was just about the different ways it was being told. It was sort of a later decision in the editing room to see how it would work if we intertwined them all, and then my dad’s narration became the spine of the film through that process.But there were certainly moments in the editing room where… You know, we had index cards for all of the moments on a bulletin board, and there was this moment where, you know, the story of my mother’s divorce from her first husband and her losing her two kids was obviously at the very beginning of the film to set things up. And there was this moment where I sort of moved that index card to three quarters of the way through the film and just saw what that looked like. And it seemed like kind of a crazy experiment, but at that moment we realized we can be structuring this in such a way that it speaks to what the film’s about, which is that, you think you’re seeing one thing in your life, and then you get a new piece of information about the past that completely changes the context around that thing you thought you understood.RT: Going back to your father, it turns out he is a pretty great writer after all. Did you get to see much evidence of this, growing up with him?SP: Yeah, every now and then he would write something small, and I was always astonished by how great a writer he was. It was something my mom really believed in. Even if you read their letters to each other when they were first together, they’re just so beautiful. And so I think it was a real frustration in her life that he didn’t pursue that, and the strange irony is that this information about her coming out is what sort of led him to do that a lot more, and for him, ultimately, through this film, to kind of be recognized as a good writer.RT: There’s a lot of commentary offered in this film about how storytelling is often selective memory, and it leads the audience to consider the fact that you, as the storyteller here, are doing the same thing, dictating the vision of this story by actively picking and choosing which bits of narrative to include.SP: I think that was really important to me to not hide behind some guise of, “Oh, I’m making a documentary that is going to be absolute fact and absolute truth,” because the truth is that’s not attainable. No documentary tells the absolute truth as anybody else would tell it. So I think it was really important for me to include the construction of this version in the film, so that it didn’t seem like I’m, in a black and white way, presenting all of these versions in a totally impartial way. That’s just not possible, no matter how hard you try. I didn’t want to pretend that the filmmaking process on any film is anything but very subjective, even if we feel we’re trying to be objective.RT: I did come away from the film with a specific impression of how things happened, but your interviews do reveal some conflicting elements, which is part of the message you’re trying to convey. When you collected all of your material, did you feel like you had a clearer portrait of your mother, or was that beside the point? Did that even matter?SP: I did, actually. It wasn’t, maybe, a conscious intention of making the film, but it was an amazing byproduct of the whole experience, to realize I do have so much a fuller picture of her than I did before I started this. Hearing so many people speak about her — sometimes in similar ways, sometimes in contradictory ways — you do start to put together a person in the middle of that mess of thoughts and impressions.RT: Have your family members had a chance to see it, and if so, what were their reactions?SP: Everyone’s been really supportive. I think I was expecting a lot more controversy around it, and everybody has come out to the premiere and really supported the film. I don?t think it’s the film anybody else would have made, necessarily, of the same events, and I’m sure people would have emphasized different things or omitted other things, but everyone’s been incredibly supportive of the way I chose to tell this story, which I’ve really appreciated.RT: Can you see yourself doing another documentary, and if so, is there a dream topic you’d want to cover?SP: I would love to make another documentary. I have a bunch of ideas, but not anything that is articulate enough to talk about yet. But yeah, for me, I think I’m a bigger fan of documentaries, generally, than I am of narrative fiction films, so I would absolutely love to continue working in this medium. But I have higher standards for documentaries than I do for other kinds of films, so it’s hard for me to get up the nerve to make another one, I think.

Now, in Dead Man’s Burden, Ms. Bowen plays a different sort of young woman: one with a long-range hunting rifle. Bowen’s lead character, Martha Kirkland, is a badass in a smokin’ new western. RT got the opportunity to chat with Clare, and we wanted to hear more about Martha (Dead Man’s Burden) and Scarlett (Nashville), and what it’s like to film in the desert. Here’s what Clare had to say:RT: You’re making quite a name for yourself now, and it’s exciting you have an indie movie coming out, called Dead Man’s Burden. I saw it, and it’s amazing to me how different your role is from one to the other, because in Nashville, it’s such a sweet, sweet role, but in Dead Man’s Burden, you’re a badass. What was it like preparing for that kind of role? How was it different?Clare Bowen: Nashville‘s like the biggest thing I’ve ever done. It’s all about empathy, I think, having empathy for your character and what they’re going through. I don’t know how you’re supposed to understand, when you haven’t lost your entire family, to try and put yourself in the shoes of somebody who has, somebody who’s trying to survive. So I just equate it to a wild creature trying to survive, and everything that she was doing was for survival, whether it was right or wrong or horrible or sweet.Going out into the desert with everyone, that was really special, because the environment is a kind of character, and so it absolutely is. It’s a beautiful, beautiful place, but it can turn harsh very, very quickly and it can just kill you in an instant. I think that was something that really helped. I don’t really know much about my own process; it just kind of happens. I just go do it. Which probably sounds really unintelligent, but I’m actually a very simple creature. [laughs]Some people work in a way of writing everything down and I do that a lot now, you know, working through a really set method that somebody else has created, but I think I’ve taken lines from a lot of places. It appears to be… it’s just the way I work, and I’ve tried different stuff for a long time. But for me, it’s just whatever comes out of me.RT: Yeah, a lot of the greats say things like, “I don’t know. I go on set and I say the lines,” and it comes out amazing.CB: It’s just about listening to the other person, which means talking to them, communicating. If you don’t have anybody there, be with yourself and be with that character and try to own it. How would you feel if everybody around you was dying? You need to try and get there, and different people have different ways of doing it.RT: Had you shot a gun before?CB: Yeah. I rustled cattle and occasionally you have to shoot something. I’ve never actually shot anything, I don’t think. [laughs] But it is something that you have to know when you’re working out in the bush.RT: So that wasn’t new to you, but it was so cool to see.CB: Oh, thank you. It’s a beautiful, beautiful instrument. I mean, I don’t particularly like guns, but that was one of the things that… it is your survival. That’s part of what my job was before acting; you have to — if your horse breaks a leg and you’re out in the middle of nowhere, you have to end its suffering.RT: What were you doing before?CB: I use to walk the cattle, in inland Australia. We’d drive them from one station to the other and walk back. Not that many people do it any more. I ended up working on a couple of ranches. Riding horses every day was so much fun during the film, and I ended up working as a wrangler a bit, because we were short-handed. That was one of the most fun parts of it. [laughs] I made wonderful friends, and I learned a whole lot about a completely new environment. It was beautiful.RT: The opening of the film is very strong, seeing you with that gun right away.CB: I think that [the guns] have this presence. The weapons that we use in the film, they each have their own character, and there’s not too many of them. I dunno; I really don’t like guns, but being in that environment, they needed them. That’s one of the things that I really liked about the film.RT: Did you end up having to show some of the guys how to use their guns?CB: [laughs] No, I’d never shot a handgun before, so they taught me how to use the Colt. I’d only ever shot rifles before. I sort of knew what I was doing. You feel the weight of the Winfield in particular, and I’m a very short person — I’m only 5’2″ — and the thing is practically taller than me, so getting the stick down inside it to pack down… You have to learn to do it really, really quickly. And it was an interesting insight into what people who were fighting with these things under heavy artillery, like cannon fire, trying to avoid that… That was one of the biggest things, imagining yourself panicking and trying to load the thing, and then dropping. There’s something about Martha’s character that’s developed through this weapon. And I didn’t expect that either.RT: It’s so powerful. And it’s gotta be a bit of an art, I would think…CB: Well, because it’s complete muscle memory, and you just try and act really calm. When everyone is just standing around and there’s a camera pointed at you, it’s easy, but if you were in a life and death situation, you hope that your muscle memory holds up.RT: You were all working really closely in the desert for a while.CB: Yeah, it was a couple months, I think. We all lived in the same house, put up in a lodge thing with a bunch of rooms. We all had breakfast together in the morning and it was really supportive. You know what? It wouldn’t have come off the way it did if everyone hadn’t been really gung-ho about it. We had actors driving four-wheel-drives to set — like David Call driving four-wheel-drives out there — because there were a few people who couldn’t, on the crew; and he knew how to do it. Just everybody sort of pitching in. I was helping with the horses. That’s why it came off the way it did. Everybody had ultimate faith in Jared Moshe and what he was doing, and we all stuck together.RT: And that was something that you were sort of already used to out there.CB: Yeah, kind of. It’s a different desert with different, you know… I mean, the bush is a really dangerous place when you think about it, and it’s really creepy. It’s interesting, though; New Mexico has this energy about it. Really wild; very, very cool. I like being outdoors, I like sleeping outdoors. And snakes don’t bother me.RT: Really?CB: [laughs] I was bringing one of the horses down to set and we were walking down this little road. I was riding him, and he sort of tugged me to the left, quite suddenly turned left, and went in this right angle square and kept going. Where was he going? I don’t know. And there’s this gigantic tarantula walking down the middle of the road. And the horse is like, “I’m not walking over that; I’m going around it.” [laughs] It was that kind of environment.RT: I don’t know if I could be out in the desert for that long, though.CB: It’s no great feat; it’s just the way you’re brought up. It’s not anything special at all. If you’re used to being outside, you’re used to being outside. I don’t cope very well in the city. I think New York is an amazing city. I loved it when I went to visit it. I don’t belong there for an extended period of time. That’s all. It’s nothing special.RT: Each city is very different, too. LA and New York are completely different.CB: Yeah. Oh, gosh, they’re totally different. They’re both, you know, wonderful places. I like it out here in Nashville; I can sort of disappear , you know, for about fifteen minutes.RT: Yeah, I’ve never been to Nashville. But I feel like I have now, after watching the show. So you’re still filming?CB: Yeah, we’re still filming.RT: The first season is coming to an end, and it’s doing really well. People are loving it. How did you get the role? How did that work out?CB: I came out for pilot season and I got this amazing script, and I couldn’t believe that a collaboration between Callie Khouri and T-Bone Burnett hadn’t happened since Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, I think. I think; I could be wrong. But anyway, I saw their names on the script and R.J. Cutler, the director; I’m amazed at his work, as well. I went in thinking, “There is no way I’m going to get this.” I was about two hours late because it had started to rain in California. It never rains in California, apparently, except for the same time every year it rains — people should probably get used to it — and so everyone forgets how to drive. So traffic was horrible, and I rang and said, “Look guys, please can we reschedule because I don’t want you to wait for me,” and they said, “Well, we want to wait for you. So get there.” And I turned up looking like a drowned rat, in Scarlett’s accent, and within, like, 35 hours my life had changed. It happened that quickly. They said, “Can you come back in the morning?” And then I think I saw them again that evening, and then they said, “Okay, you’re going to Nashville.” Really, really weird. Apparently they’d had trouble finding Scarlett . It was just amazing, and everything changed. To do exactly what I’ve always wanted to do, I feel so, so fortunate.RT: Getting to sing as well on a TV show is very cool, getting to do it all. Do you also write music?CB: Yes, I do.RT: Are you recording? Do you have albums out?CB: No, I don’t have any out yet. That’s something I left behind for acting. I got a little taste of it in Spring Awakening. Music, again, you kind of, I think, really know that… I got told by a couple of people that my voice wasn’t good enough. So I got told I couldn’t sing, and bla-bla-bla. It’s just people’s opinions, but I was really young when I got told that, so I believed them. But then, Cate Blanchett asked me if I had thought about going to Los Angeles; she was part of the casting process for Spring. So that was a bit of validation for me. I couldn’t believe it, me getting that role. And she said, “Have you ever thought of LA? Well, you better get over there.” And I did. When Cate ever tells you to do anything, just do it. Cuz she’s right. All the time.RT: Yeah, don’t think about it. Once you think about it, you’ll talk yourself out of it sometimes. Well, that’s terrific, and it’s such a great show. Scarlett’s had a couple boyfriends on the show. That must be fun; I know it’s work, but fun to watch.CB: She’s kind of being tossed around, I think. She’s got to stop and figure what she actually wants, because she always does what everybody else wants to do. So she’s at this kind of turning point now, which is fun. She’s been just a delight, she’s great. She’s just this happy little creature that just wants to make other people happy.RT: And choreographing intimate scenes can be really difficult, I know, but you all know each other pretty well by now, I imagine.CB: Yeah, it’s just like, I don’t know, you just do it. I’m terrible with the process thing. Like, what would you feel for the person that you really love? You do a strange version of that. [But] there are nine guys staring at you, with a huge camera pointed at you, and sometimes somebody’s like, “Now put your hand on your face,” and na-na-na-na. I don’t know; I have no complaints. [laughs] It’s so awkward, and you just laugh your way through it.RT: So, aside from Nashville, what are you working on next?CB: Um… [laughs] It hasn’t been announced yet, so I can’t tell you, but I’m really excited. I’d love to be able to tell you, but I’m not sure, I don’t think they’ve put the announcement out yet, so I think they’re waiting on that. But I’ve got some really, really exciting stuff coming up, and I’m working on an album — T-Bone will be producing that. I’m just really grateful for where I am.Dead Man’s Burden opens in limited release this weekend.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"impossible, dc, Awards, kong, Moore, Rocketman, adaptation, Interview, MSNBC","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"RT-Interview-Clare-Bowen-Talks-Dead-Mans-Burden-and-Nashville"},{"id":"47508840940792","title":"Elijah Wood’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Elijah Wood's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | June 28, 2013 |  CommentsMike Windle / Getty ImagesRemember when a young Elijah Wood was that kid who refused to play arcade games with his hands in Back to the Future Part II? Of course you don’t; nobody knew who he was back then. Thankfully, Wood has established an eclectic career in the decades since, most famously portraying J.R.R. Tolkien’s Frodo Baggins in Peter Jackson’s epic fantasy trilogy The Lord of the Rings. He’s done big blockbusters, thoughtful indies, animated features, and TV shows; he’s a part-time DJ; he’s great with his fans; and on January 28, he turns 36. To celebrate his birthday, we thought it would be fun to revisit the time he spoke to us about his Five Favorite Films. See below for his list.Harvey (1950)  86%Harvey is one of my all-time favorite films. This movie I saw when I was younger and I feel like it struck a chord with me, then, probably primarily because of Jimmy Stewart’s performance and the kind of magic that is this character that he refers to that we don’t see as an audience. But I think… I loved it and I’ve watched it many times since, and it’s a movie that has gotten more profound for me as I’ve gotten older, and I feel I’ve gotten different things out of it every time. It’s a movie whose construct is kind of up for interpretation, I think. You could easily make an argument that his character of Elwood Dowd is a drunk, for instance, and, you know, Harvey is a manifestation of that. You could say he’s a man who has given up on reality and, therefore, he’s happier, and Harvey is a manifestation of that. It’s such a beautiful film and there’s such humanity in the film and there’s something so enlightened — regardless of what is actually genuinely going on with Elwood’s character — there’s something so enlightened about him that everyone else is actually more insane than he is, and that always really struck a chord with me.Like, say, Wilfred?Oh man, most certainly! [laughing] Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. That’s not lost on me. I remember when I read Wilfred for the first time I was, like, wow, this is like Harvey. Incredible.I imagine that helped draw you to it.Oh, totally. Totally, yeah.Delicatessen (1992)  89%Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a filmmaker that I’ve since followed, you know, throughout his career and I think he’s one of my favorites and a kind of, you know, a very distinctive voice in France, but that film still I think is probably my favorite of his. I feel like he kind of almost returned to form a little bit with Micmacs. Micmacs really reminded me of Delicatessen in terms of its vibe. But Delicatessen is just, there’s a great amount of comedy to it, the characters are so bizarre and so well-drawn. The world is so strange, it’s not totally relatable. It’s very funny. It’s very dark. I remember when I saw that movie, I’d never seen anything like it. And I think by the time I saw Delicatessen for the first time, City of Lost Children had already come and gone. But Delicatessen was the first thing that I’d seen. And , you know, from an art direction standpoint, I think I was also so unbelievably impressed, because it was him and his partner, and I can’t remember his partner’s name who was also kind of like his art director.Marc Caro?That’s it! That’s it. Yeah, that’s it. And their collaboration yielded such incredible results. City of Lost Children being another perfect example of that. The stuff of dreams and nightmares melded together — really exciting cinema.Léon: The Professional (1994)  74%Léon. Or, as it’s known in the United States, The Professional. But in France it’s called Léon. It’s so weird because for years I’d always called it The Professional and then for some reason it switched in my mind. I mean, that movie was an amazing blend of an international eye within the context of an American… That movie still feels extremely international, certainly with its lead actor but also the way that it was shot and made. But at the heart of that film is this incredible relationship between a cold blooded killer and a young girl. And it’s still so effective and so powerful. I think one of my favorite sequences in the film was when the two of them are kind of like, it’s like this beautiful montage of their relationship as they’re, like, cleaning the apartment and these sort of things that they’re doing together, this really adorable, emotional relationship. And it’s all cut to “Venus as a Boy” by Björk. It’s such a great sequence and there’s such whimsy to their connection. And of course the movie goes into a really dark and awfully sort of tragic place, you know, and it’s really about a man whose sole purpose in life is to be cold and calculated, but it’s all about this girl finding his humanity. It’s just such a beautiful film.The Night of the Hunter (1955)  95%Oh, oh, Night of the Hunter. That’s just a film that… It was actually recommended to me by Fran Walsh, Peter Jackson’s wife. I think it’s her favorite film of all time. I’d never really seen anything like it because it’s kind of a film noir set in the South. The story, it’s about a family who are terrorized by a con-man. Robert Mitchum was an incredible actor — the original Cape Fear is another incredible performance by him — but it’s such a slimy performance in this film. He’s such a great manipulator and tells tall tales. And it’s famous because he’s got these tattoos on his knuckles of “love” and “hate” and it actually is a conduit for a really great story that he repeats throughout the film. The cinematography’s incredible; it’s just like all blacks and whites and hard shadows and lots of silhouettes along the river. It’s just a stunning, a stunning film! It’s really good. Talking about these movies makes me want to see these movies again. [laughing] They’re so good!Battle Royale (2000)  88%Easily one of my favorite kind of genre/exploitation films. Japanese film. Have you seen the film?Not yet.F— man. It’s incredible. It’s great. It’s, I dunno, it’s harrowing and it’s also deeply funny, extremely entertaining. It’s about a not-too-distant time in the future of Japan in which kids have become unruly in classrooms. A lot of violence has broken out, and as a result of the sheer number of children and the problem being as large as it is, they create this Battle Royale Act — it’s a government act — in which various classes are chosen at random via a lottery to be sent off to an island wherein, once they arrive, they are briefed and they’re all given a bag and a weapon and told to disperse into the wilds of this island. And they also are all wearing necklaces that will explode if they try and remove them.Kind of like The Hunger Games.Well, there’s certainly a lot of similarities. I don’t know if the author of Hunger Games was inspired but it certainly seems like it would be. So they go out and the object of the game is they all have to kill each other. The last man standing, or the last, you know, child standing wins and gets to leave. That’s kind of the premise of the film. And the movie literally counts down as each person is killed off and it’s just… Man, it’s great. And I think there’s real, real commentary in it as well. I think there are certain things the filmmaker wanted to say; it’s not just pure exploitation. It tries to get to the heart of what these kids’ experience is and, ultimately, humanity vs. survival, and what those things mean and having to let go of your humanity if you want to survive. And some people, some of the kids refuse to, and you just sort of see where the chips fall with some of these people in a scenario like that. But it’s wonderful. Wonderful film. It’s great.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"know, Family, King, theme","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sdf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-elijah-wood"},{"id":"47508840934646","title":"Five Favorite Films with Bret Easton Ellis","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Bret Easton EllisThe celebrated novelist and Canyons screenwriter shares his love of 1970s cinema.by Tim Ryan | August 13, 2013 |  CommentsCelebrated novelist Bret Easton Ellis is no stranger to Hollywood; two of his best-known tales of glamour and alienation — Less Than Zero and American Psycho — have been adapted to the big screen. In his latest cinematic endeavor, Ellis wrote the script for The Canyons, a micro-budgeted thriller starring Lindsay Lohan as a washed-up actress and adult-film star James Deen as a smalltime movie producer who’s obsessed with controlling the people around him. In an interview with RT, Ellis discussed his favorite films, as well as his love for 1970s cinema and his fascination with characters whose true nature is elusive.Vertigo (Alfred Hitchcock, 1958; 98% Tomatometer)I’m a little ambivalent about my five favorite films — or talking to you about them — because they are so boring.That’s impossible.It is not impossible. It is so typical. Also, by the way, it changes constantly. Not changes constantly but, depending on the mood I’m in, I could shift two or three out and then decide to sneak one in there that might not normally be there, know what I mean? And so I looked at some of your other ones and saw what people chose and, you know, I really hate to be defined by those five that I chose [right now], talking to Rotten Tomatoes or whatever. How do you do it? Do you just like… Somebody says, “OK, this is number five,” and then you talk about it?Yeah, pretty much. I think some readers think, “Oh, you tell them to pick a comedy, right?” No, absolutely not. I’m not going to tell somebody what their favorite movies are.Yeah, but if I have, like Vertigo, or Citizen Kane, or Godfather 1 and 2, which is one movie for me… You see where I’m going? It’s kind of dull. I’ll probably put Barry Lyndon and I’ll probably put… maybe Carrie. I dunno. So how do you want to start this?Well, what do you like about Vertigo?Oh good, you’re gonna lead me on this. Good. You know what I love about Vertigo? I love that it’s a movie about movies. That’s what’s so fascinating about Vertigo. And it’s also the most crushing movie ever made about romantic obsession, and how we constantly relive our obsessions over and over and we’re hopeless in the face of them. Also, just what it does with color, how it’s a movie about watching things. I do think it’s Hitchcock’s greatest achievement, [followed by] Psycho and The Birds. And I might put The Birds ahead of Psycho, in terms of how that movie ages. It’s so painterly, so beautiful. But, you know, I think Vertigo is the kind of movie really doesn’t make that much sense on a first viewing. Like, you haven’t really seen the movie until the second time. I also think that, if you’re young… I’m a big moviegoer and I did not get Vertigo at 18. It didn’t mean anything to me. And then I saw it [again, and] it must have been the 1990s when they did the proper revival of it. I think in 1983 Universal released something that wasn’t color-corrected or something; it didn’t look like how it should look. When I saw it in my 30s, after I’d been through various disappointments and love and romance, then it hit me like a ton of bricks. It just became this overwhelming experience. This hypnotic, overwhelming experience. You bring your experience to Vertigo. You don’t have to do that with Citizen Kane, but with Vertigo, you do.There are some similarities between Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo and James Deen in The Canyons in that they both have controlling personalities. The difference seems to be that Jimmy Stewart has a certain decency, and James Deen is a sociopath.OK, so this is the difference between the conception of Jimmy Stewart’s character and the conception of Christian in The Canyons. I think by the very nature of Vertigo, you need Jimmy Stewart. And you need somebody who can play that character in all of his desperation. Christian is conceived as very cold very controlling, a douchebag, yes, and ultimately malevolent.I wrote the part for James Deen. I’d seen his work. I’d seen the porn work and I’d seen the non-porn work, within the porn work, and he had something that I found very unsettling. He had a kid of goofy boy-next-door quality, and then in the BDSM scenes, some of the rougher porn scenes, there was this kind of very dark guy that seemed to emerge. And I found it fascinating. Also, I just love stuff like his eyes. He can really shut them down in a way, and they can be very cold and icy blue. I didn’t want an actor for that role, I wanted someone who wasn’t an actor, who hadn’t been trained, because all the actors that we saw in the auditions really overdid the douchiness, overdid the malevolence, and brought the wrong tonal thing to that character. James played it without any of those constraints that I thought an actor would bring to it. That’s kind of the difference.Barry Lyndon (Stanley Kubrick, 1975; 94% Tomatometer)I think [Barry Lyndon is] the ultimate movie for men. I think it’s a classic story of how you go through life, and also, for me, it’s Kubrick’s most emotional film. I know everyone accused him of being very cold, but the last movement of that movie is, I think, piercing and just beautifully told. There’s kind of this inevitability of incident that starts happening at about an hour before Barry Lyndon ends. It’s breathtaking in terms of the narrative control along with the visual control of that movie. Even though it’s very different from the [William Makepeace] Thackeray novel it’s based on — the Thackeray book is actually funnier and kinda faster, [while] Kubrick makes it a little more glacial and stately — but it still is a phenomenally beautiful movie made at the height of the great American studio era. It’s really a pinnacle of 1970s American moviemaking. And I think Ryan O’Neal was incredibly poignant in that film. And the music? The sensory experience of seeing Barry Lyndon, you can’t really make those movies anymore. It’s not even in our DNA anymore. I don’t think the sensibility even exists to build movies like Barry Lyndon. And that’s just a huge loss.Barry Lyndon is a fraud, and there’s a certain glibness and a huckster aspect to both James Deen’s character in The Canyons and the Patrick Bateman character in your novel American Psycho. Is that sort of Tom Ripley-esque persona appealing to you?I think Tom Ripley and Barry Lyndon are universal characters. I think they are symbols of who we are or who we can be. I mean, yeah, to a degree, as Christian says none-too-subtly in The Canyons, “We’re all actors, aren’t we?” I think that is part of what makes Tom Ripley and Barry Lyndon fascinating. They are actors, but also, it’s part of their true nature, which is why those characters, I find, are so riveting. And I think it does tap into the fact that, yes, we are actors in a way. I mean, I’m on the phone with you right now, I’m trying to be as authentic as I can possibly be. But I also know that this is an interview, or a discussion about movies and that, when I go into the kitchen and, like, say hi to my boyfriend, it’s just gonna be a different vibe, you know? Tonight, when I have to go to this movie premiere, and I’m gonna be introduced to people, it’s a different vibe. It’s not that I’m not genuine, it’s just that circumstances shift how you behave.Citizen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941; 100% Tomatometer)[I love] Citizen Kane, but how many times can you go over that?I think a lot of people who haven’t seen it think of it as an eat-your-veggies type of movie.Right, which is crazy that people think that, because I think out of all the movies made during that era, I think Citizen Kane is the most entertaining. Flat out, the most entertaining. It’s such a rush. Even now, after being overloaded on the spectacle of modern moviemaking, that still holds up, in a way, as its own kind of spectacle, and it never becomes boring. It always moves so quickly and so assuredly, and it’s also very funny and spectacularly visual. I think it fits very well, for modern sensibilities, to watch that movie. It seems so not-dated.There are certain old movies that feel like new movies. I think you could include some of Orson Welles’ other movies on that list, like Touch of Evil.Yeah, I think The Magnificent Ambersons does as well. I think I’ve been thinking about Welles a lot because I just read the Peter Biskind book My Lunches with Orson, which is wildly entertaining and it made me love Orson Welles even more. Everyone likes to see [his] life as a tragedy, and probably Orson Welles himself did by the end. But I just don’t. I don’t see how your life can be a tragedy if you just made Touch of Evil, or if you just made Citizen Kane, or The Magnificent Ambersons or even the Shakespeare movies [Macbeth, Othello]. I think everyone’s lives have that kind of rise and fall. I mean, everyone kind of ends up in the same place to a degree, and there is the case that people saw Orson Welles as this kind of tragic figure and I just kind of reject that. I just don’t feel that way.The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972; 100% Tomatometer)There’s nothing more to be said about the Godfather, movies. I mean, like, just leave a blank. I have nothing to say, except they’re probably my favorite movies. I mean, what do you say about that?That they’re awesome?Yeah. But it’s also, does it suggest the idea that American movies, in that space of, say, The Godfather, the mature-driven, adult movies of that era, that were also wildly popular with an audience… it’s just gone. I’m reminded of that a lot because I am of an age. I was actually too young for The Godfather, to see it theatrically. But, you know, just remembering that era… I mean,, my boyfriend is 26, and he doesn’t get why I’m, like, depressed about the state of current movies. Though every now and then… We were watching TV last night and suddenly came across Coming Home, which I never really liked that much; I thought it was kind of like a hazy, kind of dippy-ish Vietnam era [film]… you know. But watching it last night before going to bed, I was hypnotized by the craft of a big studio movie being made about that subject in an uncompromisingly adult way. And the movie looks gorgeous. It’s so well-made that my boyfriend turned to me and said, “Movies looked like that? Are you kidding me?” I said, “Yeah, they do look like that.” I think Haskell Wexler was the DP. Now you have qualms with the love triangle and the noble bent or whatever, but the craft and the score were just enveloping. It also was a reminder of what movies once were, they’re not [like] that now. But you have to just move on. And The Godfather, without really talking about it, The Godfather to me is the height of what movies for a mass audience were once.Carrie ( Brian DePalma, 1976; 91% Tomatometer)Do you have any random wildcards?Well, you know, I’m just not that kind of moviegoer. I really don’t have wildcards. I did a column for Film Comment about guilty pleasures this month, and I even have to quantify that: I don’t have guilty pleasures. I don’t believe in it. And I think one of the most “pleasurable” movies ever made is Carrie, which I was going to put on, and I’m dreading the remake because I have a terrible feeling that it’s going to be like a treatise on bullying, and that is going to kind of overwhelm the horror aspect of it. And of any movie that does not need to be remade because it wasn’t kind of good enough, it’s Carrie. Because there is about 45 minutes of the prom sequence that is spectacularly visual, and it cannot be bettered upon. I take kind of an affront that they’re even doing that. But I don’t have a wildcard. But Carrie was also for me, again, that kind of auteur-driven movie that was both personal and also could reach a mass audience.The Canyons is currently in select theaters and is available for streaming on Amazon and iTunes.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TV, Skip, superman, 21st, psychological, ViacomCBS, TCA, Paramount, christmas, thriller, Nat, natural, Musical","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ewfrewf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-bret-easton-ellis"},{"id":"47508842200323","title":"Five Favorite Films with Derek Cianfrance","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Derek CianfranceThe writer-director of The Place Beyond the Pines on his all-time favorite movies.by Luke Goodsell | March 28, 2013 |  CommentsDerek Cianfrance’s 2010 drama Blue Valentine earned strong reviews and confirmed stars Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling as among the best actors of their generation. For his follow-up, the filmmaker has again enlisted Gosling, together with Bradley Cooper and Eva Mendes, as part of an ambitious, three-part drama on the legacy of troubled fathers and sons. It’s called The Place Beyond the Pines, and it opens in select theaters across the country this week. Here, we talk with Cianfrance about his favorite movies.GoodFellas (Martin Scorsese, 1990; 97% Tomatometer)First one I’d say is GoodFellas. When I was a teenager I slept underneath a picture of Martin Scorsese. I think GoodFellas is just a perfect film. From an efficiency of storytelling standpoint, from an entertainment standpoint, from a performance standpoint, from a use of music standpoint, from a cinematography and editing standpoint — to me it’s just a perfect movie. That’s a movie I saw when I was 16 years old, when I watched it in a theater 30 times. A perfect movie.You must have been happy to have Ray Liotta in The Place Beyond the Pines.I was. When I first met with my co-writer, Ben Coccio, I found out that his favorite movie was GoodFellas, too — so we said, “Hey, why don’t we write a movie together and let’s write a role for Ray Liotta in it.” And then five years later there I was sitting in an audition room with Ray Liotta — it was like, you know, dreams really do come true.Did you tell him how many times you saw his movie?Yeah. And he said, “Oh, I only saw it once.” [Laughs] Someday, I think they’re gonna carve his face into a mountaintop.The Gospel According to St. Matthew (Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1964; 94% Tomatometer)Next choice I’d say would be The Gospel According to St. Matthew, by Pasolini. I saw that movie for the first time when I was 23 years old. I’d gone to church every Sunday and catechism every week for my whole childhood, but I never paid attention; I was always daydreaming in church — and all of a sudden I went to go see this movie, and I knew everything in the movie. I guess all of my Catholic upbringing I had absorbed through some sort of osmosis. Here was this movie which was this Biblical story which was told so beautifully: the cinema was so simple and so beautiful. He had, you know, Odetta playing “Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child” as the three wise men found Mary and Joseph and baby Jesus. It was, you know… I started sweating while I was watching the movie. The whole left side of my body went numb while I was watching, and I was sure that I was having a heart attack. It was all that I could do — you know, I didn’t want to because it was the greatest movie I’d ever seen — but it was all I could do to crawl out of the movie theater and knock on the projectionist’s door and ask him if I could call my girlfriend. I called my girlfriend and told her I thought I was dying, ’cause I was seeing the greatest movie I’d ever seen, and she showed up. I remember it had been snowing in Colorado and she had all this dirty snow on the roof of her car and I was eating all this dirty snow because my mouth was just parched. And I remember being in the emergency room and thinking that when the doctor walks through, if he looked like Jesus from The Gospel According to St. Matthew, I knew that meant I was dead. Fortunately the guy didn’t look anything like Jesus.Gimme Shelter (Albert Maysles, David Maysles, Charlotte Zwerin, 1970; 100% Tomatometer)Another one of my five favorite films would be Gimme Shelter, by the Maysles brothers. I spent many years making documentary films between my first film and my second film, Blue Valentine, and I learned to really embrace, and be humbled by life, and by telling a story where you’re telling someone else’s story. And there’s something about the Maysles brothers, and especially that movie, where they were able to witness these moments. Especially with Gimme Shelter, you know, these moments of American history — this concert at Altamont that turned into kind of the bad trip of Woodstock. And I love how they frame it with the band, the Stones, watching the footage, watching their memories; this document, this witness to this incredible time in American life — and this crime, this real crime in America. Also, for nothing else than the moment where Mick Jagger has to watch Tina Turner. Again, like watching the Scorsese movie — and the Pasolini movie — their use of music, you know, is to watch a real rock and roll movie in the theater, with that sound. It’s great.Contempt (Jean-Luc Godard, 1963; 93% Tomatometer)Next one would be Contempt by Godard. The first time I ever saw it, on a VHS copy 25 years ago, I thought it was the worst movie I’d ever seen. Actually, every Godard film I’ve ever seen I’ve hated the first time. But it got re-released a number of years back and I was in New York and saw it at the Film Forum, and I felt like I was seeing Halley’s Comet, you know — I couldn’t believe how wrong I was; how much I’d despised this film the first time I saw it and how much my second viewing was completely the polar opposite reaction. I think the performances, from Bardot and Piccoli to Jack Palance, to, you know, Cotard’s photography and Delerue’s amazing repetitive score… to me it’s one of those Godard movies where it’s a perfect balance between heart and mind, you know? Oftentimes his films are extremely heavy, but this film was not only heavy — you could forever gaze into it on repeated viewings, as it appeals to your intelligence — but it also appealed to your soul. It was a huge, huge inspiration for Blue Valentine, especially the middle section of Contempt, where it feels like this 45-minute sequence where this couple is in their apartment.A Woman Under the Influence (John Cassavetes, 1974; 94% Tomatometer)The last film I would say — and I could pick many of his films, but I will choose Woman Under the Influence, by Cassavetes. I could also have said Faces, or I could have said The Killing of a Chinese Bookie, or Husbands, or Minnie and Moskowitz, or I could have said Love Streams, but — today it will be Woman Under the Influence. I love the structure of it; its two-part structure — it really feels like a film in two movements. Arguably the two greatest performances of all time, between Peter Falk and Gena Rowlands. You know, it’s a home movie, and everything I’ve been trying to make are home movies — movies that take place inside the house and the family. I love the spirit of Cassavetes’ films, in that he’s casting his wife and his best friend in the roles, and his mother and her mother are in it, and the kids. To me it’s a movie that changes, too, throughtout the course of my life. I know the movie isn’t changing, I’m changing; but when I watch it the movie seems to shape-shift. I remember the first time I ever saw it I thought she was crazy; I remember on the 50th time I watched it I thought she was the only sane person in the movie and everyone else was crazy. I love that about movies that are made with a certain openness — that the audience can kind of participate in the imagination of the characters, you know; of their lives and of the story.The Place Beyond the Pines is in select theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"MTV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sdff.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-derek-cianfrance"},{"id":"47508844241172","title":"Five Favorite Films with ParaNorman Directors Chris Butler and Sam Fell","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with ParaNorman Directors Chris Butler and Sam FellThe writing/directing team behind this week's stop-motion animation talk the films that influenced their creation.by Luke Goodsell | August 16, 2012 |  CommentsFollowing the success of Henry Selick’s wondrous Coraline in 2009, the team at Laika studios are back this week with their second animated feature, ParaNorman, another stop-motion marvel concerning the misadventure of a young outsider and his spooky connection to the land of the dead. Pitched as “John Hughes meets John Carpenter,” it’s written by Coraline and Corpse Bride animation artist Chris Butler and co-directed by Butler and Aardman alum Sam Fell, with voices by Kodi Smit-McPhee, Anna Kendrick and John Goodman, and music by Jon Brion. We had a chance to chat with Fell and Butler this week ahead of the movie’s release, where they talked about five of their favorite movies — and how they influenced the creation and execution of ParaNorman.The Breakfast Club (John Hughes, 1985; 100% Tomatometer)Sam Fell: We’ve compiled a joint list. These five are really about ParaNorman; they’re directly connected.Chris Butler: Although, to be fair, ParaNorman is definitely a result of these movies that made me who I am — they’re the movies I grew up with, and that’s what ParaNorman is all about. So in a way they are influential on us.Sam Fell: Complete faves, yeah. We’ve spent a lot of time together, even before we started the film — that’s how we knew we could work together, by comparing films that we liked and talking about them. And so, our first one’s The Breakfast Club by John Hughes. Obviously, in ParaNorman, we’re picking up on different high school stereotypes, and John Hughes touched on that so beautifully — especially in this movie. I think the most amazing thing about this film when you watch it is that it’s just pure character. There’s no spectacle or anything. When you watch it — you know, it was a mainstream, successful movie and everyone went to see it — but when you watch it, it’s almost like an art movie.So ParaNorman is The Breakfast Club trapped in a zombie movie.Chris Butler: Yeah. And that leads us into our second movie…The Fog (John Carpenter, 1980; 68% Tomatometer)Chris Butler: We’re often talking about ParaNorman as being John Hughes meets John Carpenter, and that was intentional. It was to try and tell a spooky story that was almost… you know, we talked about it like being directed by Sam Raimi as well. It was to try and combine all those elements: All the angst of a movie set in high school, where your issues are more about, you know, being bullied by the kid who lives down the lane, but to couple that with a movie about the more fictional horrors of monsters. I like that play. They’re actually a really good marriage. I’ve talked about ParaNorman being the characters from The Breakfast Club dropped into the plot of The Fog — and The Fog, I would say, would be one of the other influential ones. Right from day one of writing, I think. I love that movie, as bad as it is…Oh, I think it’s a great film. It tends to get overlooked, coming right after Halloween in the Carpenter filmography.Chris Butler: Right. It is really good. I think when you watch it today — and I still happily watch it — a lot of the effects haven’t aged very well. And that’s part of its charm, I think. But what I think is really good about it is the mythology that it creates, and it’s mythology based on an historical event, like the best campfire stories. In fact, the movie starts with a story around a campfire. It’s just a perfect way to set up a horror mythology. That was a big influence. Rather than just making stuff up — or just having unmotivated ghouls and monsters — I wanted ParaNorman to kind of hinge on something, an event of history. And in ParaNorman‘s case, it’s fictional, but it very much takes its cues from the Salem witch trials. That creates instantly a very rich mythology to play in. So that was a big thing. The other thing [about The Fog] is that it’s a small town about to celebrate its anniversary and suddenly everything goes wrong — and yes, there are lots of ghoulish corpses walking around. I can’t say how much we owe to that movie, really. [Laughs]Possible spoilers ahead.The witch trial back-story also creates a lot of sympathy for the so-called “monsters.”Chris Butler: Yeah, absolutely. And I thought that was important from day one. If you’re gonna do a zombie movie, you have to do something different. And I thought — I’m sure you’ll do a spoiler, ’cause I don’t want to ruin everything — but if you think about it, logically, if you brought back a host of puritans from the grave, they would be pretty outraged and terrified.George Washington (David Gordon Green, 2000, 83% Tomatometer)Sam Fell: Number three is George Washington by David Gordon Green.Interesting choice.Sam Fell: It’s an interesting choice, yeah. You wouldn’t necessarily associate it with this. But if you think about ParaNorman, one of the things that, from the beginning, we realized we wanted was to create a real place — a real sense of place — and really hold up a mirror to the contemporary world and not create a fantasy American town. We wanted to really believe in it. And it was already in the script that [the movie’s fictional town] Blithe Hollow would be rotten around the edges and not a perfect place. We love imperfection; it’s throughout — even the family in the story are imperfect. So what was really cool about watching George Washington — and looking at the photography by William Eggleston, by the way — was just how the kind of downbeat world was celebrated, though great cinematography and great photography. And in George Washington, a lot of it’s just about the sense of place. It really takes time developing a sense of place with great photography and sound. So in our first act, when we introduce Norman’s world and the town of Blithe Hollow, especially when he’s walking to school, we actually put shots in there that normally wouldn’t belong in an animated movie — not a Western animated movie. Just shots of odd corners of the world that are kind of run down. Not necessary, but they kind of create atmosphere. We love that kind of vibe. Early on, Chris had tried a little bit of [composer] Jon Brion’s music [as a temp score] — and it had that same kind of slightly off-beat vibe to it, and we wanted to have that vibe to this world at the beginning. Then when we introduce the fantasy elements, it’s a real contrast.Is that how you ended up getting Jon Brion to compose the soundtrack?Sam Fell: Yeah. It was slightly unexpected in a way. It was purely picking a piece of music that already existed that fit, really early on, and when we got the opportunity to sit around and talk about who we wanted to do it, that piece of music had stuck from day one. So we were like, “Well lets try and get him.” And he jumped at the chance. The music that he did for this movie is sublime. It’s beautiful.The Goonies (Richard Donner, 1985; 63% Tomatometer)Chris Butler: Okay the next one, and it’s a big one, is The Goonies. I think it’s almost self-explanatory. I remember seeing The Goonies as a kid and I think it’s that sense of — it is almost like a Scooby-Doo-esque adventure become real, and I think that’s what made it so appealing to me as a kid. It wasn’t that it was raucous and loud, it was that these kids were incredibly relatable. They were real kids. They came in all shapes and sizes, they were incredibly flawed, and very funny. They were rude, they bickered; they just felt so real, and they were a lot of fun because of that. So yeah, The Goonies — huge influence.Sam Fell: Massive one, yeah.Evil Dead 2 (Sam Raimi, 1987; 98% Tomatometer)Sam Fell: Number five is Evil Dead 2. Mostly for the camera and the editing in that thing. The sheer kind of bravura, mad energy it had, you know. Like, when we get into our second act and the story starts picking up, we just wanted that energy, and we looked a lot at the way Raimi used the camera in that movie. It was almost cartoonish.Chris Butler: It’s outlandish.Sam Fell: Outlandish, yeah. And the sound as well. The sound design in that film. It’s kind of interesting getting from George Washington to Evil Dead 2. [Both laugh] But that’s what we do.Is it hard to replicate that Evil Dead 2-style of camerawork in a stop-motion film, or easier — because you can pause the camera and control it more?Sam Fell: It’s a bit of both. The hard thing is to get that sense of spontaneity, you know, that kind of roughness — because it can be a bit too smooth if you program those moves in stop motion. But it was kind of good in this show because we just had a really good visual effects supervisor that enabled us to really fly that camera around more than you usually would. It’s not the usual kind of stop motion.Chris Butler: Yeah. And you’re right, there are limitations physically. We have a couple of shots that are very Sam Raimi, where we’re speeding through the gravestones in the graveyard, and just being able to get the camera low enough to the ground was a huge ordeal. Logistically it just becomes almost an impossibility, but we wanted to keep those shots in so we found all kinds of tricks to help us through.The thing about this film, like Coralline, is that it uses 3-D well; especially when people have gotten really blasé about it. Is it the stop-motion that makes the 3-D work?Sam Fell: Yeah, its ’cause its tangible, very tactile, you know. There’s a magic to the fact that these puppets seem to be moving of their own accord, and watching them, I always wanted to reach in to the screen and grab one of those things. Now with 3-D it just creates another dimension; a window into this magic. So I just think it makes it even more tangible, and even more sort of uncanny. I think they really are made for each other, these two forms.ParaNorman opens nationwide this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Tomatazos, LGBTQ, spy, Marvel, 2019, in, show, york, Winter, comiccon, CMT, Dark, Countdown","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ChrisButlerSamFell.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-paranorman-directors-chris-butler-and-sam-fell"},{"id":"47508842208520","title":"Five Favorite Films with Jason Mewes","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Jason Mewesby RT Staff | February 26, 2013 |  CommentsYou know him most famously as the “Jay” in “Jay and Silent Bob,” the odd couple that frequently pops up in Kevin Smith’s films (Smith himself plays Silent Bob), but Jason Mewes has managed to stay quite busy outside of his collaborations with his longtime friend (which currently includes a weekly podcast). His latest role comes in noobz, a wacky road trip comedy that pokes fun at the world of competitive gaming. Mewes recently stopped by the RT office for a guest spot on our Rotten Toatoes radio show and stayed a bit longer to offer us his Five Favorite Films, so without further ado, here they are!Krush Groove (Michael Schultz, 1985; N/A Tomatometer)Krush Groove is awesome because it has all the old hip-hop people that I like. You know, LL Cool J, Run-DMC, who I love, Fat Boys, Sheila E. One of my favorite scenes in any movie is in that movie when Run comes out and he’s like “We have a whole lot of superstars…” It just gives me goosebumps when I watch it.House Party (Reginald Hudlin, 1990; 96% Tomatometer)House Party is a favorite of mine because Kevin and I, when we first started hanging out actually, we started watching that movie. I watched it with him, he sort of introduced me to it. It has Martin Lawrence who’s amazing, and some of my favorite quotes are from that movie. That whole house party dance with Kid n Play where they do the kicking and dancing, me and my buddies used to go to parties and try to do that and it’s obnoxious.Serenity (Joss Whedon, 2005; 82% Tomatometer)Firefly or Serenity (the movie)… that was a really good show. I was really into Buffy and Angel, and when I was done watching them I was really bummed about it being over, and I’m like “I can’t believe I’ve watched them all, what’s next?” My buddy said “Hey, the guy who created that, Joss Whedon, also created a different show, called Firefly.” So I watched that and there were only a few episodes, one season, but they made the movie, which was amazing. I’m just super into sci-fi.The Nightmare Before Christmas (Henry Selick, 1993; 96% Tomatometer)I just really dug the whole thing, and it’s something… I don’t if I can explain it, except for Jack Skellington [Jason stars singing] “What’s this? What’s this?” The singing and the cool horror, it was just a different movie for me.Star Wars (George Lucas, 1977; 93% Tomatometer)I’m sure a lot of people say this one. As a kid, the toys, the action figures, being able to watch the three movies, and being able to watch them over and over, and then so many years later, they came out with the new ones. And now they going to make more. It was a big movie growing up. As a kid, again, the toys — I go back and watch some of those old commercials for [putting on his announcer voice] “The Millennium Falcon!” it just gives me goosebumps and reminds me of my childhood. Growing up, I didn’t get any of the toys; my family couldn’t afford to buy them. But what was awesome was my friend, he had two brothers, and they all wanted the same Star Wars toys, so their parents would get them three TIE fighters, or three Death Star sets. So on Christmas, I’d open up my presents, run to my friend’s house, and they would get every single Star Wars thing, and I could play with them. And then they got into GI Joe, and they had the big hovercraft, and the space shuttle, it was awesome. Anyway, the combination of the movies and the toys makes it a classic for me.Noobz is currently available on DVD.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"LGBT, 2020, History, TV, awards, 71st, saw, Television","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cxvz.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-jason-mewes"},{"id":"47508844249367","title":"Five Favorite Films with Bobby Farrelly","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Bobby FarrellyOne half of the comedy duo behind Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary and this week's DVD release The Three Stooges on his all-time favorite movies.by Luke Goodsell | July 17, 2012 |  CommentsAs one half of the Farrelly brothers, writer-director Bobby Farrelly has been one of the filmmakers instrumental in shaping modern American movie comedy. Before the Apatow era, the Farrellys redefined the idea of raunchiness on screen, delivering multiple hits like Dumb and Dumber and There’s Something About Mary while helping elevate performers like Jim Carrey and Ben Stiller to superstar status in the process. (Their unlikely influence on the mumblecore genre is also, apparently, not to be overlooked.)This week, the duo’s latest — their take on the classic slapstick The Three Stooges — arrives on DVD and Blu-ray, which gave us the chance to talk with Farrelly about his all-time favorite films (and get an update on the Dumb and Dumber sequel).Jaws (Steven Spielberg, 1975; 100% Tomatometer)I’ll never forget when I saw Jaws in the theater, the impact it had on me — so much that I wouldn’t swim in a swimming pool for the rest of the summer. [Laughs] And I enjoyed so much hearing later how Spielberg had had a hard time working with the shark, so they had decided to not show the shark, and instead use the music, you know. The way they did that was just incredible; the way they would shoot so that you’d see just the shark’s point of view instead of seeing the shark itself. It taught me, as a feature filmmaker, how important music is and involving all your senses and all that. So that’s my all-time favorite movie — Jaws.It really was a stroke of luck that things didn’t go right on that film.[Laughs.] Right. It really was. And I’m reminded too, as a filmmaker, that stuff happens when you’re making a movie — so you’d better be thinking quick, and sometimes you can turn it to your advantage. The filmmaking process is never gonna go as easily as you hope, so you’d better be ready for some curveballs.Did you ever experience a happy accident like that on one of your movies?We’ve had a lot of happy accidents over the years. I remember when we were making our very first movie, Dumb and Dumber, just because when we started, we started in May, and the story calls for winter. It was a particularly warm spring, and we thought, “Oh my god, it’s not gonna look too wintery.” So we went to the highest mountain we could find, which was Estes Park in Colorado, and the night before we planned to shoot we had a foot and a half of snow — and it was everything that we needed. So we got lucky that time. That was a big break for us.That is one of my favorite comedies of all time, I have to tell you.Oh thanks. We’re right now working on the sequel, which is 20 years later with the same guys, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. We’re hoping to be shooting it this fall. It hasn’t been easy to get off the ground, but we’re still hoping to be shooting in the fall.I heard you guys had hit a glitch with the studio, yeah; but everyone wants to do it — both Jim and Jeff?Yeah. Yeah. Jeff’s at a point in his career where he’s got a lot of stuff going on where he’s got that new show and, you know, he’s really at the top of his game right now. So we would love to get those two guys back together. And it’ll be almost 20 years later, so with those two characters that seems like about the right time for a sequel. I’m glad we didn’t do one the next year or two years later or something like that. Twenty years later we can have a lot of fun with we’re they’re at.Will they have changed at all? I hope not…Very little personal growth. [Laughs.] Very little. That’s who they are. [Laughs.] They don’t have a lot of character arc in their story or in their lives. You know who they are, and they’re pretty consistent.The Sixth Sense (M. Night Shyamalan, 1999; 85% Tomatometer)The Sixth Sense. I don’t know if you’d call it a horror movie — the genre’s not really my cup of tea, but I heard people say “You gotta go see this movie The Sixth Sense.” I was blown away, ’cause I took it hook, line and sinker. I never saw that ending coming. I was one of those guys. M. Night had the hook in my mouth. He shot it in a way that, when I go back and look at it and knowing what you didn’t know the first time, I just think he did a masterful job with that movie.I tend to agree. I’d heard nothing about it, and the ending got me.Yeah. I’m so glad I didn’t know. I went with some friends in Texas, where I live and — [laughs] — on the way home in the ride, one of them still didn’t get it, and we had to explain it. [Laughs.] And this was an intelligent person. But it was just so well crafted, you know; it really was well done. And I think a lot of people have tried to imitate that storytelling, but it’s hard to do as well as he did it in that movie.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (George Roy Hill, 1969; 89% Tomatometer)I think I gotta go with that old stand-by, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Love Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Love the — you know, it’s the two guys. It’s what me and my brother specialize in, the two guys. Well, in the Three Stooges‘ case it’s three. But the relationship between two guys like that, I don’t think it’s been done any better than with Butch and Sundance; particularly with Robert Redford and Paul Newman. The way they worked in so many different things, from comedy to romance to action and the way it’s so beautifully shot and, you know, a great story. And they didn’t pull the punches at the end. If you made that movie today, I’m sure that you’d do the test screenings and somebody would raise their hands and say, “We want them to get away at the end!” But they didn’t get away at the end. Today you’d have to re-shoot the ending where the guys go off on some secret beach somewhere and live happily forever — ’cause that’s the way audiences kind of demand it. But with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, of course, they met their demise at the end of the movie, and they had it coming ’cause that’s who they were. I just think it was a beautiful movie.I love that era of downbeat endings in the late ’60s and early ’70s. Directors were getting away with all kinds of stuff.Yeah, it was a good time for filmmakers. But again, they didn’t have the test screenings. In today’s day and age, you kind of have to give the audience what they want. They demand it, and so there’re an awful lot of endings that fall right into a particular category. They want a happy ending, so people walk out and they’re happy — but not all stories in the world have happy endings, and that’s why I love some of the ones that leave you, you know, without the traditional ending.The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972; 100% Tomatometer)[Laughs.] They’re classic, I know — I’m not really picking ’em deep from my quiver — but I’ll go with The Godfather. I can watch it any day, any time. The original Godfather. The sequels were good, but the original Godfather was masterfully done. All those characters who you come to know; 30 years later you still talk about Sonny Corleone. It really sticks with you. It just felt so real. I’d read the book before I saw the movie, and usually when you read a book and then see the movie you say, “Eh, the movie didn’t live up to it,” but on that one I really think that [Coppola] captured it. Just a powerful, powerful story. And it felt real. I’m not really a fan of violence, but in that movie it didn’t bother me in the least — because none of it felt gratuitous, like they were just doing it for effect. I really believed it was the lives that those guys lived. I really thought it was just a beautiful movie. All those tremendous actors in it, too — years later, you realize he did a pretty nice job of casting it.Especially when you think about who the studio had wanted, too — Robert Redford as Michael Corleone was one suggestion, I think.Yeah I know. [Laughs.] I bet they were. Sometimes you gotta go to the man on some of these things — and the studio does have their reasons for wanting to cast people. Generally they want the guys that are seemingly the hot ones at the time. But I can’t imagine recasting that movie and making too many changes. They certainly got the characters right.Animal House (John Landis, 1978; 90% Tomatometer)I gotta get a really good comedy in there, and I don’t know if there’s ever been a better comedy — for my funny bones — than Animal House. All the laughs they crammed into that movie — I don’t know that it’s been beat. All the different characters; the way you basically, again, you like the anti-heroes — you like the guys who were in college and they were the slackers and all that. Just so many laughs in that movie. For me, if I’m flipping through the channels and I see Animal House on, I could sit down and watch that movie at any time, any day.Does that movie describe yours and Peter’s college life?Well, we were closer to those guys. [Laughs.] Closer to those guys than the guys in the good frat. [Laughs. ] We were not particularly good students. We certainly, you know, tried to have a good time when we were at college — and we both succeeded. [Laughs.] We weren’t “frat” guys, but if we were to join one, we probably would have been in the Delta House.The Farrelly brothers’ latest, The Three Stooges, is out now on DVD and Blu-ray.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Central, Crunchyroll, Song, chucky, Classic, to, 2017, All, Geographic, TV, Alien, Music, CBS, aliens, E3","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BobbyFarrelly.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-bobby-farrelly"},{"id":"47508842359055","title":"Five Favorite Films with Tony Bennett","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Tony Bennettby Grae Drake | November 21, 2012 |  CommentsChances are, if you’re breathing, you’re a fan of Tony Bennett. Winner of 16 Grammys and 2 Emmys, Mr. Bennett is also an accomplished painter and founder of The Frank Sinatra School of the Arts. His career has spanned over 60 of his 86 years, and you might assume that he wants to slow down a little, but that couldn’t be more wrong. In fact, he’s now the subject of another documentary, this time executive produced by his son and manager Danny Bennett. It puts a beautiful twist on music documentaries. The Zen of Bennett is as artistic as the man himself, and shares with you the incredibly, well, zen perspective of a worldwide legend.We asked Mr. Bennett his five favorite films. Much like his new documentary, out now on DVD, his answers were simple, elegant, and full of the passion that has drawn us to his music for decades.The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (John Huston, 1948; 100% Tomatometer)My favorite movie.Modern Times (Charlie Chaplin, 1936; 100% Tomatometer)Charlie Chaplin was a genius and a great humanist.My Fair Lady (Goerge Cukor, Scott Heming, 1964; 94% Tomatometer)It was such a wonderfully written movie.The Kid (Charles Chaplin, 1921; 100% Tomatometer)Another great Chaplin film.Citizen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941; 100% Tomatometer)Orson Wells was a genius!The Zen of Bennett is available on DVD on November 19th.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Action, TV, mission:, Awards, book, Land, X-Men, Adult, Network, period, Baby, caribbean, cooking, BAFTA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sdf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-tony-bennett"},{"id":"47508844248342","title":"Five Favorite Films with Timothy Spall","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Timothy SpallThe charismatic British character actor talks about his favorite movies, terrifying small children and working with Clint Eastwood.by Luke Goodsell | August 3, 2012 |  CommentsOne of the busiest and most recognizable British character actors in movies, Timothy Spall cuts a unique figure of comedy and menace that’s seen him play everything from Winston Churchill in The King’s Speech to the nefarious Wormtail in the Harry Potter series. Along the way, Spall has worked for the likes of Clint Eastwood, Tim Burton, Ken Russell and Bernardo Bertolucci, while his collaboration with longtime friend Mike Leigh yielded an acclaimed lead performance in the director’s Secrets &amp; Lies. This week, Spall makes an appearance alongside Donald Sutherland and Christian Slater in the action thriller Assassin’s Bullet, and we had the chance to chat with the very charming actor about his career and five of his favorite movies.A Matter of Life and Death (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1946; 95% Tomatometer)I’ll tell you what my favorite film is. I think it goes like this: A Matter of Life and Death, by Pressburger and Powell. Do you know that film?I do indeed. It’s funny, one of your “peripheral” Harry Potter co-stars — Daniel Radcliffe — picked that as one of his all-time favorites.Isn’t that interesting? It’s a great, great film. It’s marvelous.Mary Poppins (Robert Stevenson, 1964; 100% Tomatometer)One of my favorite films of all time has got to be Mary Poppins.Oh that’s curious. How does Mary Poppins come to be on your list? Is that a favorite from your childhood?Well I was old enough to remember it when it came out, but I don’t think I saw it in the cinema, I think I saw it when it eventually came on television. In those days, you had to wait about six or seven years before a film got from the f–king cinemas to the television, and it being Disney, they never actually released their films. It was a very clever policy: They just re-released them every 10 years. I think it’s one of those movies. I was having a very depressing time recently working on a job. I was feeling particularly bad and I put the television on on a Sunday afternoon, and Dick Van Dyke was singing “Chim Chimney” — it just lifted my spirits. Everybody criticized his Cockney accent — and even at the time I probably joined in — and you can criticize his Cockney accent, but you cannot criticize his brilliant comic dancing. It’s f–king wonderful. Oh, it’s wonderful. And the quality of the work: The beauty of that film, the simplicity of it and the way it was made and directed; the charm. The way it appeals to people — it’s the old cliché, you know: Eight or 80. It’s a wonderful piece of work. And it’s magical. It’s one of those films, you know, that you can dip into. If you’re ever feeling low, stick it on and you’ll feel much better. If you haven’t got any illegal drugs, put that on and you’ll be alright. [Laughs]Today’s lesson for the kids: Don’t take drugs, do watch Mary Poppins.[Laughs] Yeah. Say “no” to drugs but “yes” to Mary Poppins.You’ve sung on film a few times yourself, of course — in Sweeney Todd, in Gothic, in Topsy-Turvy—Oh god. [Laughs]I especially enjoyed your duets with Alan Rickman.Well that’s very nice of you, thank you. That’s probably one of the most repulsive characters I’ve played in my life.But what a lovely voice.[Laughs] Well it was a joy to manifest such a greasy, disgusting little man. But I don’t regard myself as a singer. I never ask to do it but I can sometimes just about hold a tune, as long as it’s all part of the character. I’m not about to start jumping about on the West End stage in a musical. But it’s nice to be involved in a film that’s got a bit of singing in it and manage to acquit yourself without too much embarrassment — that’s always an achievement.Fargo (Joel and Ethan Coen, 1996, 94% Tomatometer)I would definitely then have to say Fargo. I love the Coen brothers.The Fugitive Kind (Sidney Lumet, 1960; 60% Tomatometer)What’s that one… the one with Marlon Brando and Anna Magnani, from the Tennessee Williams script. It had several titles. It was called Orpheus Descending, the [original] script…The Fugitive Kind — is that the one?Yeah, that’s it! The Fugitive Kind. It’s f–king brilliant, I love it. Anna Magnani and Brando.Naked / Secrets &amp; Lies (Mike Leigh, 1993/1996; 88/94% Tomatometer)One more… I think it’s gonna have to be Naked by Mike Leigh.You don’t wanna say Secrets &amp; Lies?[Laughs] Well look, why don’t you say Naked/Secrets &amp; Lies? I didn’t want to be self-congratulatory in any way. [Laughs]You can pick your own movie.Well not only is it a great film, it was very important for me because I was very ill just at the time it won the Palme d’Or. So the fact that I didn’t die and the film had gone around internationally and won all these awards… not only did I not die, I had a film career when I woke up. I was very pleased about that. [Laughs]Not dying, that’s always a good result.Yeah, I was very ill. But thankfully I got over it, and that’s why I have a very joyous, lunatic relationship with life — ’cause it can easy go, you know.Next, we chat to Spall about Harry Potter infamy and his favorite career moment.&nbsp;I have to ask the obligatory Harry Potter question: Do kids always recognize you as your character, Wormtail?Timothy Spall: Well I more often than not get sort of slightly frightened-looking children looking at me and wondering if I might be that person in restaurants. And occasionally I get six- or seven-year-olds coming up with a piece of paper [to be signed] with looks of horror on their face, being pushed towards me by their older brothers or sisters. [Laughs][Laughs] So you inspire a kind of low-level fear in children?Well yeah. [Laughs] I take that as a compliment, any recognition. I’m not stupid enough to think that, being that young, they’ve seen my work with the Royal Shakespeare Company from the 1970s — [laughs] — so I make the assumption that it must be for Harry Potter, or Enchanted as well.Now that’s a good film, Enchanted.Isn’t that a good film? I’m glad you said that. I think it’s a good film, very much in the vein of a Mary Poppins-type thing. I’m really pleased with that film. Again, it’s one of those ones — and without going on about ones I’ve been involved in — it’s one of those films that you know will be around for a long time and people will like it.I liked that Disney had a bit of fun with their legacy on it.Yeah, yeah. It does poke fun at itself, which is good. I was very pleased to do that.Looking over the list of some of the directors you’ve worked with — there’s Mike Leigh, Tim Burton, Kenneth Branagh, Cameron Crowe, Bertolucci, Clint Eastwood, Ken Russell—[Laughs] That is pretty impressive, isn’t it?Now that I’ve it read to you, huh?[Laughs]Is there a particular experience that will always stand out for you?Yeah. I mean, the thing is, I cherish the experience with these chaps and the people that I work with. But you know, given that I’d say Clint Eastwood. About 20 years ago when I did my little part in White Hunter Black Heart, I remember walking on to set and thinking “Oh my god, I’m just about to be directed by Clint Eastwood.” Because I didn’t meet him in the interview — I did the interview on tape in London, and they sent the tapes over and he cast me from the tapes. So we’re doing this scene and it was the opening and he said “Hi Tim, it’s great to see you. I’m gonna give you a shot…” — and I can’t remember the film director’s name — but he said “…it’s like Charles Laughton in the film The Beachcomber.” And I realized that not only am I working with one of the icons of Hollywood, but two things: He was being very charming and helpful and complimentary, and he knows films back to front. To know some obscure Charles Laughton film from the 1930s was very impressive. So — and I must have been in my early thirties then — I was thinking, “This is all right.”You chose the right job.Yeah. Or he picked me, in this case, which was very nice. My career, you know, I’ve been around a bit now, and I’ve been very fortunate to work with all these great people. I have to say — and it’s not fibbing — it never ceases to thrill me that I end up working with the people I admire. It’s a joy and a great privilege. Long may it carry on. Long may I be tolerated by the people I admire![Laughs] And we look forward to tolerating more of your work.[Laughs] Oh that’s very nice of you to say.Assassin’s Bullet is out this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Century, Reality, Hallmark, Returns, movie, screenings, Searchlight, comics, know, Crackle, cartoon, Warner, mission:, italian","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TimothySpall.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-timothy-spall"},{"id":"47508844253465","title":"Five Favorite Films with Jay Duplass","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Jay DuplassThe other half of the indie team behind this week's The Do-Deca-Pentathalon on his all-time favorite movies.by Luke Goodsell | July 2, 2012 |  CommentsA couple of weeks back we heard from writer-director Mark Duplass on his five favorite sibling movies, so it seemed only fitting that we give his brother and co-collaborator Jay a chance to add his voice to the family discussion. Following the success of their mainstream-leaning Jeff, Who Lives at Home earlier this year, the brothers Duplass are back in theaters this week with a smaller-scale piece that recalls their mumblecore origins. The Do-Deca-Pentathalon — which was actually shot before the team went “Hollywood” with Cyrus — focuses on the rivalry between two brothers (notice a theme?) as they compete in a homemade version of the Olympics. Cannily timed for the 2012 event, in fact, and sure to appeal to all those fans of both overblown sports circuses and micro-budgeted indie films. To mark Pentathalon‘s release, then, here are Jay Duplass’s five favorite films. Take it away, sir.American Movie (Mark Borchardt, 1999; 94% Tomatometer)This is probably the most influential film on Mark’s and my work. Deeply passionate, hilarious and inspired filmmaker Mark Borchardt battles to finish his horror flick despite a lack money and common sense. What transpires is heartbreaking, hilarious and at the same time incredibly inspiring.Rocky (John G. Avildsen, 1976; 91% Tomatometer)Rocky one — it feels ridiculous to have to qualify Rocky with a “1,” but the subsequent sequels have smokescreened the truth that the original Rocky won the Oscar, is a monumental humanitarian story, and most importantly… Rocky does not win the final fight with Apollo. Some people literally don’t believe me when I tell them this. If you’ve forgotten this, please re-watch it. I promise you won’t be disappointed.Raising Arizona (Joel and Ethan Coen, 1987; 90% Tomatometer)I think everyone is now aware of this creative meteor, probably the most inspired piece of art I’ve ever witnessed. Think about it: The Coens created two main characters you desperately root for who have kidnapped a baby! Only the masters could pull this off, and make you laugh and cry intermittently throughout.Dumb and Dumber (Peter and Bobby Farrelly, 1994; 63% Tomatometer)I know, I know… indie cred is now out the window. But what can I say? Mark and I saw this film at Christmas 1994 in a movie theater, and I laughed so hard I sweat out 5 lbs of water weight and got rock hard abs in the process. We took a camping road trip to the mountains and almost froze to death because of it. I’ve seen it probably 20-plus times and it just makes me so happy every time.The Horse Boy (Michel Orion Scott, 2009; 79% Tomatometer)This is a tiny documentary that for me, is so much more than a movie. In short, it’s about an autistic boy who’s Texan parents take him on horseback to inner Mongolia in search of a Shamanic healing. It’s not the easiest film to watch, but in my opinion, a miracle happens on screen.The Do-Deca-Pentathalon is in select theaters this week and is available through VOD.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Disney, spider-man, TV, twilight, miniseries, witnail, Amazon, Box, football, MCU, Horse","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JayDuplass.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-jay-duplass"},{"id":"47508846022953","title":"Five Favorite Films with Elizabeth Banks","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Elizabeth Banksby Alex Vo | March 23, 2012 |  CommentsIn our final Hunger Games Five Favorites feature, we present Elizabeth Banks, who plays the vapidly effervescent, Effie Trinket. Trinket is the Reaping Day host for district 12, the one who pulled the names out of the lotto and sent Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark on their way to the Capitol where they, and 22 other tributes, fight to death in the Hunger Games arena. We spoke to Banks for illumination into her movie viewing history.Giant (George Stevens, 1956; 97% Tomatometer)Number one is Giant. Starting off with the incomprable James Dean. I love that movie. I love how epic it is in scope. I love that it’s about a woman who is coming into her own and thinks she’s going into one situation and, of course, has to dominate and overcome. For me, for my money, if I had to choose between Giant and Gone with the Wind, I’d go Giant every time.Where would Gone with the Wind place on your list?It would not place in my top five.Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, 1994; 95% Tomatometer)Number two, I’m going to go with Pulp Fiction. It just came out at a really fun time in my life, my early 20s. Maybe even before that; was it ’96?It was 1994.I think I was graduating from college, yeah. It was just so fresh and amazing, and the storytelling, you know, changed cinema forever. I just loved it. And it brought back John Travolta. Every character was incredible, and I loved its really dark sense of humor. Like, literally some of the hardest laughing I’ve ever done in my life was when John Travolta accidentally blows the head off that guy. [laughs] Making that funny is such a feat. The comic sensibility of Quentin Tarantino never ceases to amaze me.Romeo + Juliet (Baz Luhrmann, 1996; 70% Tomatometer)The next movie on my list, which is Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet, starring Leo [DiCaprio] and Claire Danes, that was the movie where I was like, “I want do this for a living.” It was one of the few times in my life that I’ve been truly jealous of a bunch of actors.That hadn’t happened for you until you saw Romeo + Juliet?Not in the way that really… Like, I saw the movie at a pivotal moment in my life when I was really deciding if I was going to pursue acting, and it was something that I want to be part of, a film like this.Do you ever think about what your life would be like if you hadn’t seen Romeo + Juliet, or if it never came out?It’d probably be pretty similar; I just wouldn’t be so jealous of Claire Danes.The Sweet Hereafter (Atom Egoyan, 1997; 100% Tomatometer)I’m going to go with The Sweet Hereafter. I just love the sort of darkness of that movie, and I just think the performances in that movie… I love Sarah Polley and I always have. That movie, it stayed with me. It stayed with me for a very long time.Any Barbra Streisand Musical / Flashdance (N/A Tomatometer / Adrian Lyne, 1983; 29% Tomatometer)Number five, I’m going to go with… I’m picking between the multiple Barbra Streisand musicals of my youth that we would watch on Sundays with my mom. They’re all good. Anything with Barbra Streisand.Would you watch them on television with your mother?Yeah. I mean, if I had to pick my first R-rated movie that I was like, “This is the greatest movie I’ve ever seen in my entire life,” it was Flashdance. My mom took me to see Flashdance when we were really young. It was like way underage for R-rated; you know, you had to go with an adult. She was the adult who took us, because to my mom, it was just a story about a ballerina.Was she surprised by the content?No. I think, actually, she went and saw the movie with her friends and then decided, you know, “It’s okay; I can take the girls.” She loved it. That whole stripper thing, it kind of went over our heads.The Hunger Games is playing in theaters now.For more Hunger Games interviews, check out Five Favorite Films with Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, and Woody Harrelson.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Trailer","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ElizabethBanks.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-elizabeth-banks"},{"id":"47508846008612","title":"Five Favorite Films with Lawrence Kasdan","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Lawrence KasdanPlus, the writer-director reflects on Darling Companion, his long collaboration with Kevin Kline, and writing the screenplay for The Empire Strikes Back.by Luke Goodsell | April 20, 2012 |  CommentsAs any student of popular American cinema knows, the name Lawrence Kasdan is synonymous with some defining movie experiences among audiences of a certain age. One of Hollywood’s hot young screenwriters in the ’70s, Kasdan was enlisted by George Lucas to help pen The Empire Strikes Back, the film that — along with the Kasdan co-written Return of the Jedi — helped transform Star Wars from blockbuster movie into cultural myth. Soon after, Kasdan’s second film as director, The Big Chill, effectively captured — for better or worse — the feelings (and musical tastes) of a generation of Baby Boomers entering thirtysomething adult life. And between those films, Kasdan’s screenplay for Raiders of the Lost Ark was turned into another massive hit — and enduring piece of movie iconography — by Steven Spielberg.As a director, Kasdan has moved from thrillers (Body Heat) to Westerns (Silverado, Wyatt Earp) to drama (Grand Canyon) and comedy (The Accidental Tourist), picking up four Oscar nominations along the way. He returns after a lengthy hiatus with this week’s Darling Companion, a comedy starring Kevin Kline and Diane Keaton about the search for a lost dog that brings on some typically Kasdan-esque moments of life assessment.We sat down for a chat with Kasdan earlier this week, in which he talked about his new film, his long collaboration with Kline, and his favorite memory writing on Empire. Read on for that, but first, he talks about his five favorite movies.Shampoo (Hal Ashby, 1975; 61% Tomatometer)I have a 1000… I have a top 100. I can tell you five movies that are important to me, but as I say, I could go on and on. Shampoo is important to me. Hal Ashby, one of the great directors of our time, died very young, and is sometimes overlooked; but he did The Last Detail, and Being There, and he is a great director. And Robert Towne wrote the script with Warren Beatty. It’s a brilliant script, a portrait of LA at a certain time and the United States when we were going through a spasm of political activity that was very discouraging — it ends with the election of Nixon and Agnew. It’s hilarious, it’s sexy; it deals with all the variety of complications of people’s behavior. Jack Warden is brilliant in it; hilarious in one of the greatest scenes ever shot: At the end of the movie when Beatty comes back to his house and he thinks that Jack Warden’s gonna have him killed ’cause he’s slept with both Warden’s wife and his daughter, Carrie Fisher. It’s a great, great film, but Warden is brilliant in that scene. The movie is full of great writing; it’s almost like a French farce, but very modern. Beatty is at his absolute best. Everybody in it is great. Julie Christie’s a knockout. So that’s an important movie that not enough people have seen.Yojimbo (Akira Kurosawa, 1961; 97% Tomatometer)Yojimbo is the most entertaining movie ever made. Kurosawa’s flat-out entertaining. He said “I wanna make a movie that’s delicious enough to eat,” and that’s the way it is — it’s the most entertaining movie you can possibly think of. It’s been redone, as you know, as Fistful of Dollars, and it owes a lot to Red Harvest: It’s about any stranger that comes in to a corrupt town, and there are a lot forces at work. It’s very much like Red Harvest, Dashiell Hammett’s novel, in which he puts all the bad forces at work against each other. Yojimbo is hilarious. Toshirô Mifune in as great a role as he ever played, and he’s great in about 20 Kurosawa films. It’s just delightful from first shot, which is him walking along the road and then deciding where to go by throwing a stick up in the air and following the direction the stick lands, and he immediately comes upon a peasant boy who’s leaving home and wants a more exciting life, and that boy is seen throughout the film as he becomes involved in the criminal element in town; and at the end Mifune spares his life and tells him to go back to eating rice or whatever he’s complained about at the very beginning. The photography is phenomenal. Kurosawa’s the greatest filmmaker of all time. The use of lenses, the mise en scène — absolutely spectacular.Did you ever have the chance to meet him?I met him once. It wasn’t like a long meeting. [Laughs] It was [in Los Angeles], he was being honored. The DGA gave him an award when he was 80 years old, and he said “I’m just beginning to understand what film is about.” I met John Huston that same night. It was quite a night.Out of the Past (Jacques Tourneur, 1947; 96% Tomatometer)Out of the Past is my favorite film noir. I ripped it off viciously and completely — that and Double Indemnity — for Body Heat. [Laughs]Well, it’s a good one to rip off.[Laughs] I just saw a thing with Springsteen from South by Southwest — did you see his speech? Fabulous. He talks about the Animals song, “We Gotta Get out of This Place,” and he says “That’s every song I’ve ever written.” And there’s no shame in that, when you’ve been inspired by… when someone’s spoken to all your issues and all your aesthetic. Out of the Past, directed by Jacques Tourneur and written by Daniel Mainwaring, based on a novel with a great title — Build My Gallows High. Mitchum is spectacular. Jane Greer, who was 21 years old or something, and seems like she’s 35, she’s a great femme fatale. Kirk Douglas is in the third lead, as the villain, and he’s beautiful — you can see why he’s gonna be a star in a matter of years; a couple of years later he was a big star, and he’s hilarious. The talk is some of the best dialogue ever written. There’s a moment when Jane Greer, who’s already betrayed Mitchum twice in the movie, comes in to once again try to work her spell on him, and she says “I’ve thought about you, I prayed for you” and he says, “You prayed, Kathie?” — and he says it with the greatest line reading of all time — “Get out of here, I’ve gotta sleep in this room.” So Out of the Past — see it.Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964; 100% Tomatometer)Strangelove — you can watch it again and again. Brilliant. To me, maybe the funniest movie ever made. Huge variety in the styles of the movie. Some of it’s shot like cinéma vérité documentary. Some of it’s very stylized. The mise en scène changes radically. When you’re in the bomber it’s hand-held — it might as well be Richie Leacock, or one of the Pennebakers making a movie; that’s how free-form it is. Totally realistic, even though you have Slim Pickens as the pilot of the jet that’s taking the atomic bomb to Russia. He’s hilarious, and yet you have a sense of this is really what it looks like — what their equipment looks like, what the gauges and the codes look like. They do a really funny sequence where they open up their survival box and there’s a condom, and there’s a 45, and it’s totally believable. And of course it ends with Slim Pickens riding the atomic bomb down like a wild horse toward Russia, and the world ending. And Sterling Hayden, absolutely hilarious throughout the movie, and Sellers playing five parts, I think. The scenes between him and Sterling Hayden, where he’s the British officer who’s been assigned to this airbase and Sterling Hayden is completely wacko and is convinced that they’re stealing his precious bodily fluids, because when he had sex he felt depleted. [Laughs].Red River (Howard Hawks, 1948; 100% Tomatometer)One more. I’d have to say Red River. Great Western. John Wayne, Monty Clift — Monty Clift couldn’t be more wrong for a Western, and yet it totally works. When they finally have their fist fight at the end, they’ve taken and shot Wayne to even out the fight, because Wayne was about six inches taller than Clift, and 80 pounds heavier, and the fight works fine. The spirit of the cattle drive is extraordinary, the amount of drama that happens; the father and son struggle — in essence the Oedipal struggle, even though he’s not actually his son — between Clift and John Wayne, is magnificent. It’s pure Hawks: Men on the trail doing something dangerous, and doing it well. You can’t ask for a better Western. It talks about the whole opening of Texas, and it talks about the relationship between men. It talks about the dynamics of leadership, talks about betrayal. It’s Shakespearian, really, without any pretention. Pure Hawks.Next, Kasdan chats about his new movie Darling Companion and reflects upon his favorite parts of writing The Empire Strikes Back.&nbsp;Darling Companion revolves around the frantic search for a lost dog. The story is that you were inspired by you and your wife finding and losing your own dog, Mac?Lawrence Kasdan: Yes, Mac. We rescued him and then we had him for a couple of years and then we lost him, in the mountains. We had gone away for a wedding with a friend and he got scared and he ran away. And we searched and searched and did all the things that are in the movie: We put it on the radio, we put signs everywhere, and we almost gave up, and then a woman we knew said, “Don’t give up — he’s out there.”Was she similar to Ayelet Zurer’s psychic character in the film?She is similar. She felt that she had an affinity for animals that was beyond the normal thing. She felt that she could tell that he was alive. But what she did that was most valuable for us, was she said, “You must not give up on this.” That really was the difference, I think.And he’s still with you?Yes. He’s at home, a few miles from here. He’s 14 years of age.Some are calling this movie a part of a trilogy, along with The Big Chill (1983) and Grand Canyon (1991). Is there something in your mind that circles around every decade or so that makes you take stock of where you are in life?I don’t think it’s a conscious thing, but obviously there is some sort of rhythm going on, because when I was in my ’30s I did make The Big Chill and in the ’40s I made Grand Canyon. And it’s not about generation. It’s about people that I knew, and concerns that we had, and raising two children in Los Angeles, and what’s it like to have your children move out — and that’s in Darling Companion.It’s about How do you find that companion that’s gonna last you a lifetime? What makes someone special to you that you can trust them, that they’re gonna be there forever? They may not look right — like Richard Jenkins doesn’t look right to other people, but he’s the perfect man for the Dianne Wiest character. It’s about young love and it’s about old love. It’s about all the varieties of companionship.Will you and Kevin Kline reunite in another 20 years for your Cocoon or On Golden Pond?[Laughs] I don’t know — we may be ready for that sooner. [Laughs] The one thing I’ve realized is that you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and every time you get to make a movie, and every time you get to work with people you like, you’re really lucky. And that’s happened six times with Kevin. It’s been a real delight. I think he’s wonderful, and he’s really fun to work with. He can do anything. He was a great cowboy, he was a great rider, in Silverado (1985); he handled the guns really well. And then he was a Frenchman, and an Italian, and an American for me — he’s done everything. He’s the funniest guy I know.The scene I liked best in the film is when Diane Keaton is trying to pop his dislocated shoulder back in, because it shows how good he is — how good both of them are — at simultaneously playing comedy and drama in the same moment.I’m so glad you said that; that’s my favorite scene in the movie.What is it about you and Kevin two that works as a collaboration?I think it’s the trust: I trust his instincts, he trusts mine. If I say “Give me a little less, do a little less, do a little more,” he will do it. He’s all about the work. No ego. He’s all, “What’s the best way to do it?”, “What about this, what about that.” He gives you a million choices. You’re happy to see him when you get there in the morning.How did you guys meet, originally?I was casting Body Heat (1981) and there was an amazing explosion of talent in new York theater. I had seen a lot of people out in LA; I went to New York and I met Bill Hurt and Kevin Kline and John Heard and Chris Walken, they were all that age, they were all emerging at that moment. Quite a line up — and there were more. It was incredible period of acting in this country. I hired Bill Hurt for Body Heat, but I remembered Kline and said, “I gotta work with this guy.” He’d already won two TONYs at that point, I think. He could do anything: He’s an athlete, a dancer, a singer; everything. When I put together The Big Chill I wanted him at the center of it.&nbsp;There’s an unmistakable line in Darling Companion, I think it’s spoken by Dianne Wiest’s character: “The dark side is strong…”[Laughs]You’d have to be one of the few writers to reference your own work like that and get away with it, because it’s now part of the popular lexicon. When you include a line like that, does it feel like you’re just pulling something out of the cultural ether or do you consciously remember, “I worked on that script”?[Laughs] Oh, I remember it very well. That’s a very vivid time for me. I had just written Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) for those guys, and I went to give it to George [Lucas] and he said, “Do you wanna write Empire?” And I said, “Don’t you wanna read Raiders first?” He literally offered it to me as I handed it to him, and he said, “I’m gonna read it tonight, and if I don’t like it I’m gonna take back this offer for Empire.” But he liked it. [Laughs]Lucky he liked it.Yes. [Laughs] I remember working on it. We did it really fast. [Director Irvin] Kershner was involved. He was a fascinating guy. An odd choice for Empire, but he wound up making the best Star Wars movie, I think — even though the first one is really the breakthrough. That’s astounding, the first movie, ’cause no-one had thought like that before; but Empire, I think, is maybe the best one.I’m not gonna argue with you.[Laughs]Do you have a favorite line that you wrote for that film?Well there were a lot of things, you know. We invented the way Yoda would talk. When I started talking to George about it, he said, “We’ve got this character and I don’t know how he should talk. Should he talk backwards? How should he talk?” And I wrote all that stuff, and Frank Oz did that voice and he was spectacular. It’s amazing, to create something like that, and then have the whole world sort of embrace it.Darling Companion opens in New York and LA this week, with more locations to follow.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Returns, series, Black, aliens, TCA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/LawrenceKasdan.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-lawrence-kasdan"},{"id":"47508844257563","title":"Five Favorite Films with Patton Oswalt","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Patton OswaltThe actor, comedian and co-star of Seeking a Friend for the End of the World picks five movies to watch before the apocalypse.by RT Staff | June 22, 2012 |  CommentsBetween his stand-up comedy, astute writing on pop culture and wonderfully odd performances in movie and TV roles, Patton Oswalt is a something of a modern media renaissance man. He’s voiced a rat for Pixar, terrorized a football franchise in the excellent Big Fan, and earned well-deserved praise for his part in last year’s Young Adult; and this week, Oswalt appears in director Lorene Scafaria’s Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, in a small but funny role as an enthusiastic party-goer who’s succumbed to his most wanton desires as the apocalypse approaches. In the spirit of impending doom we chatted with Oswalt earlier this week, and asked him to pick five films he’d want to watch if the world was about to end.The Searchers (John Ford, 1956; 98% Tomatometer)Right off the top of my head, it’d be John Ford’s The Searchers…Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (George Miller, 1981; 100% Tomatometer)…The Road Warrior…The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1943; 95% Tomatometer)…The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp…The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (Joseph Sargent, 1974; 100% Tomatometer)…The Taking of Pelham One Two Three — the original…After Life (Hirokazu Koreeda, 1998; 83% Tomatometer)…and then a Japanese film called After Life.I mean, they’re just movies that I watch when I’m feeling kind of blue and just wanna take more emotional leave of my brain — so it would just be all about creating a head space where I’m really happy, and enjoying myself. And being really happy that people can put together movies that good. It’s all the same thing. It’s the idea that mankind can get together and make something that good — I know how hard it is, how collaborative it is to make a movie, so the idea that all those movies exist is what makes me happy.Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Lionsgate, superhero, series, television, Emmys, Superheroe, HBO, TV, competition, america, 007, Kimmy, actors, Freeform","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PattonOswalt.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-patton-oswalt"},{"id":"47508846038317","title":"Five Favorite Films with Josh Hutcherson","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Josh HutchersonPlus, he discusses excitement about bringing the Hunger Games to big screen life and why the movie's action scenes reminded him of his childhood in Kentucky.by Tim Ryan | March 22, 2012 |  CommentsJosh Hutcherson is only 19 years old, but he’s already amassed an impressive resume in Hollywood, delivering strong performances in big mainstream fare (Journey 2: The Mysterious Island) and critically-acclaimed indies (The Kids Are All Right). He stars in the hotly-anticipated The Hunger Games, playing the good-natured, protective Peeta Mellark. In addition, Hutcherson stars in the forthcoming Red Dawn remake, and acts as an executive producer on the high school horror/comedy Detention. In an interview with RT, Hutcherson shared some of his favorite movies; in addition, he discussed his excitement about bringing the Hunger Games to big screen life and why the movie’s action scenes reminded him of his childhood in Kentucky.&nbsp;Fight Club (David Fincher, 1999; 81% Tomatometer)Fight Club. That was one of those movies I saw a long time ago, way before I should have seen it, and the acting and the story in that blew my mind. That is probably one of the bigger movies that made me want to be a good actor. The characters are amazing and the story is so cerebral and hard to follow; it’s really a thinker that really kind of got me super interested in that kind of movie.When did you see it?My parents would kill me, but I saw it when I was like 10 or 11 years old.Whoa, yeah, I don’t know if you’d get all the nuances then.Exactly. But I was obsessed with it and watched it many times.White Men Can’t Jump (Ron Shelton, 1992; 77% Tomatometer)White Men Can’t Jump. That’s one that, every time it comes on TV, I sit down and watch the whole thing. I love basketball, and I love that story, and I just think it’s a really cool movie.So you grew up in Kentucky. Are you a Louisville fan, a University of Kentucky fan?UK. University of Kentucky, die-hard.Drive (Nicolas Winding Refn, 2011; 92% Tomatometer)Drive. That movie was just awesome. I love Ryan Gosling in it, the story was so great, the cinematography, the music, everything about that movie. I could watch it over and over again.The Lion King (Rob Minkoff and Roger Allers, 1994; 89% Tomatometer)The Lion King, which is surprising. However, growing up, that movie was so seminal to my childhood. I watched it again when it was rereleased a couple months ago in 3D in theaters, and that movie holds up. It’s an amazing movie, and it came out in 1994 or whatever it was. Just for me, there were so many morals in that movie that had been a part of my life since I was a little kid.Cool Hand Luke (Stuart Rosenberg, 1967; 100% Tomatometer)The final one is Cool Hand Luke. Paul Newman’s the man. I love him in everything, and his character in that is just amazing. I love the story. It’s so simple; not much happens, but everything happens. I love it.Next, Hutcherson talks about bringing the Hunger Games to the big screen and why the movie’s action scenes reminded him of his childhood in Kentucky.&nbsp;You’ve been in a couple movies based on literary properties. When you read the book as a fan, are you thinking, “How am I going to do this?” And if you’re a fan of the book, are you thinking, “Man, people are going to have expectations about how I’m going to play this.” Do you think about stuff like that?Josh Hutcherson: Sort of. I mean, I’d be lying if I said that I never thought about it once. But for me, it’s acting, and no matter if it’s this movie or another movie, I’m going to kind of go into my on-set personality the way I normally would. So I don’t let it affect me that much, but it’s really cool being a part of something that has this big of a following built up before you even release the movie. It’s really cool to be a part of it. There is a bit of pressure to kind of keep it true to the book and do a good portrayal of the role, but I feel like that happened. I feel like the script was a great adaptation of the book, and I think that people will be, overall, pretty happy with it.You were a fan of the Hunger Games series going in?Yeah, well, I read the books when I found out they were making [The Hunger Games] into a movie. I read all three books in like five days and became totally obsessed with it, and obsessed with Peeta, and was on board from that point on.Similarly, you’re also in the remake for Red Dawn. With a book, you can kind of visualize something unique, but if you’re in a remake, how do you avoid doing an impression or something? I heard your parents really loved Red Dawn — how do you do them proud on something like that?I think the way we did it, we updated it. We took the original movie and sort of made it work with modern times. I think that the original movie had a really great story and a really great idea. I think that we just kind of took that same core idea of a country invading another country and having these teenagers, more or less, fighting back against the army. So we just updated that. What’s cool about Red Dawn is that every kid — at least, I know I did and all my friends did, growing up — always played army man and ran around the woods and that kind of thing. And so to kind of have that captured in a film where they’re actually fighting back against a real army is definitely pulls in the nostalgic action themes.You talk about running around in the woods. Obviously the setting of The Hunger Games is different, but did that bring you back to your childhood games?Totally. I mean, there’s something to be said, because when I was little, I was running around the woods playing make believe, and now that I’m older and have a job, my job is to run around the woods and play make believe, so it was pretty cool. It definitely was a very freeing experience because it was so? not juvenile, but it really took me back to being a little kid.One of your grown up things is you’re an executive producer on Detention. What’s that like? Is it just more stuff you have to keep track of?Yeah, pretty much. I mean, with Detention, I was really involved more so with the casting process and doing a little bit of the script work, so that was kind of my main role in that. But for me, I’ve always, since I was little, been interested in all aspects of filmmaking, so kind of getting behind the camera is definitely something that I’m into.I’ve read that you said you wanted to start acting when you were around four. How do you make that a reality?It’s not easy, especially being from Kentucky. There’s not much of the industry there, as you can imagine, and so it was one of those things where I knew what I wanted to do, and I told my parents that, and we didn’t really know how to go about it. But I got a small agency in Cincinnati, Ohio, and we met an acting coach and he said, “We should just go out to California for pilot season,” because he felt that I could work. And of course, you tell somebody that who wants to be an actor, that’s like the ultimate goal, so I was like, “Yes, we have to do it.” My parents were obviously reluctant, because we knew nothing about it, but lo and behold, my mom went out there with me to California to become an actor, and it worked out.The Hunger Games opens in theaters this week.For more Hunger Games interviews, check out Five Favorite Films with both Jennifer Lawrence and Liam Hemsworth.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TV, america, cinematic, Guild, Disney, cancelled, drama, E3, curtis, Disney, FX, Walking, movies, play, Britbox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JoshHutcherson.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-josh-hutcherson"},{"id":"47508846040366","title":"Five Favorite Films with Genesis Rodriguez","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Genesis RodriguezPlus, the Casa de mi Padre star on her history in telenovelas, what she thought of Will Ferrell playing a Mexican, and working alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in Last Stand.by Luke Goodsell | March 16, 2012 |  CommentsIn the odd chance that you happened to be watching Mexican telenovelas sometime in the last five or six years, you may have locked eyes upon Genesis Rodriguez, a young actress who was a regular cast member on several shows before moving to Los Angeles for an arc on Entourage. You’re also likely to enjoy her performance as Will Ferrell’s absurdly radiant paramour in this week’s Casa de mi Padre, a movie that riffs heavily on the telenovelas of Rodriguez’s past. The actress’ training in those deadly serious, unintentionally cheesy melodramas proved a perfect fit for the film, which calls for a steely straight face while delivering ripe dialogue and acting against kitsch sets — not to mention Ferrell’s weirdly intoned Spanish.We sat down with Rodriguez for a chat last week, in which she reflected on working with Ferrell and his intentions behind playing a Mexican. Plus, she talked a little about working with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the forthcoming Last Stand. First, though — before we ran out of time — she ran through her all-time five favorite comedies…Step Brothers (Adam McKay; 2008; 55% Tomatometer)It’s such a tough question. It could be five favorite comedies?It can be. If you insist.Okay. Well, Step Brothers, because it’s an innocent, funny movie and Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly just kill me. I just die of laughter.Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (Adam McKay, 2004; 66% Tomatometer)I’m sorry, I’m gonna go there — Anchorman is another one. [Laughs] Sorry. It’s just genius. That type of humor is just genius.It is genius, but… you do look like you’re being paid by the Ferrell corporation.Too bad! I was a huge fan.National Lampoon’s Vacation, European Vacation, and Christmas Vacation (Harold Ramis, Amy Heckerling, Jeremiah Chechik; 1983, 1985, 1989; 94%, 38%, 63% Tomatometers)I was a huge fan of Chevy Chase, so I’ll have to just condense them and put Vacation, European Vacaction, and Christmas Vacation all under one.Young Frankenstein (Mel Brooks; 1974; 94% Tomatometer)Young Frankenstein. Mel Brooks. It’s a classic.Zoolander (Ben Stiller; 2001; 64% Tomatometer)I’m gonna make an obvious choice: Zoolander. And that’s that. Very funny movie.Next, Rodriguez on how her telenovela background prepped her for Casa de mi Padre, what she thinks of Will Ferrell’s Spanish, and working with Arnold Schwarzenegger on Last Stand.&nbsp;This was your first major feature, but you were previously acting in the kind of telenovelas it parodies — was that how you got involved?Genesis Rodriguez: I moved out [to Los Angeles] after finishing a six-year contract. I was getting out on certain things on TV. I did a little part on Entourage. And this was like my first real film audition. It was kind of wonderful how it worked out, because what I had done was so fresh, you know — and I knew exactly what to do. Telenovelas and, you know, Mexican movies — old Mexican movies, for example — they’re so serious and they just look a little bit off and wacky. So I felt like I had to be extremely serious to make it work. And I knew I wasn’t the funny guy — Will’s the funny guy. Gael [Garcia Bernal] and Diego [Luna], obviously, they kind of blew us out of the water too.They’re actually very funny here.Who knew? They’re exceptional actors. They were amazing. But I was kind of like the anchor in the movie, with kind of a “real” character in all the ridiculousness. I got to play around, too, don’t get me wrong.But being so straight makes things funny.It does. Being so serious… in real life, when people are so serious and so intense, it kind of makes me laugh because I think, “Why are you so serious?”Telenovelas are notoriously melodramatic. Did you find them funny when you were working in them, when you were meant to be serious?Oh absolutely! I mean, I’ve had ridiculous situations, if you put it in the context of the characters I’ve played. A lot of them were just like, “What? I really did that? That’s totally unbelievable.” Just ridiculous plot twists. And it was also because we were two days off air, so the audience kind of controlled what they wanted to see. So one day I would hate the person, and two days later I’d just be making out with him, in just the most random emotional moment.They’d poll the audience to see what they wanted?Yes. Tomorrow I might be just crying the whole time. Or I’m gonna be blind. And then I come out, and I see again. [Laughs] Just weird stuff.You were invaluable to this film, then.[Laughs] I guess.The director likened you to a young Lana Turner — that’s some compliment.I don’t know what to say. He’s amazing. I can’t… that really touches me. I mean, somebody validates you like that and, honestly, these guys — if something ever really takes off and I should have a really long career, then they should take a percentage, because they’re the ones who said, “This girl.”Don’t say that on record. When Will Ferrell’s bankrupt he’s gonna come after your money.He should! He totally should have a percentage of Genesis Rodriguez. [Laughs]&nbsp;Tell me what it was like working with him. He’s not a native Spanish speaker, so did you guys play tricks on him?Well Diego and Gael improvised a lot, and sometimes you would just see like a blank stare [laughs], so you did not know what was going on — with the director as well. Diego and Gael just really went for it, just improvised.Did much of that end up on film?Yeah, a lot of it. I wouldn’t say all of it because it was written out for us, the dialogue; it was just so well done — so ridiculous. But they added so much to their characters, with little details. That’s how they improvised. To see Will speaking Spanish, it was pretty incredible for me because he’s honoring our culture — and the fact that he wasn’t playing the American guy trying to speak Spanish. He wanted to be as authentic as possible. He wanted to be Mexican. And he did. He learned the cadence of how the Mexican accent is, and that’s what I find so surprising, because that’s not something that you learn in a month. It really isn’t. That tone and just the sing-songiness is just really impressive. And this is coming from a Cuban-Venezuelan who has another accent and has to sometimes have a Mexican accent in other things.So you could tell whether his accent was really bad or not.I could tell. And I know from experience how hard it is to grab that intonation. It was just ridiculous sometimes, the intensity in Will’s eyes — just the intensity mixed with the Mexican Spanish. I couldn’t believe what I was watching.He was kind of immersed in that character.Yeah, he was awesome, He really was.The way I saw it, he wasn’t making fun of these movies — it was more of a gentle homage.Absolutely — that’s how I saw it.He really dedicated himself.He did. He was so worried. He was so worried about his Spanish, and his authenticity. And I think he really did it. He really did it, but like you said, for an homage. I mean, we know what telenovelas are: I come from them, I used to watch them. I love them, you know. But he just made it incredible that he shone a light on it. It’s wonderful, for our culture, that they’re just doing this. And it’s Will, you know — that’s one guy that can just do this and bring his type of humor into another language. It’s him.What was your favorite part of the shoot?I mean every part was incredible, to work with him, but there’s so many epic scenes — it’s so passionate and so over the top. One of my favorite moments was when he was trying to get me on a horse and he offers me, you know, a hand. We didn’t plan any of that out. I just hung over the horse and the horse decides he wants to participate in the scene — and this is not a part of the movie — but he just starts walking off. And nobody yells “cut” so I didn’t get off of it, I just dangled there like a dead body for a very long time. Will left the scene and there was just me slowly getting off it. I was like, “Is anybody gonna yell ‘cut’ out here, because what if this guy takes off?” [Laughs]Do you have any acting inspirations? Apart from Lana Turner, of course, to whom you’re now heiress.Oh that is too much! [Laughs] Let’s keep it more down to earth, please. I just hope to do more movies that continue to entertain people, although I would love a super-challenging and thought-provoking movie…But you’re so good at comedy.I love it. I just love it. It’s something that I’ve never done before and I never thought that I could do. I have acted a fool for, like, 12 hours and I wish I could pay someone to have me continue doing it. It’s the best job ever.You’ve got Jee-woon Kim’s Last Stand coming up, with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Where are you at with that? I assume you’re not acting the fool in it.[Laughs] I just finished it. We just finished at the end of January. I can’t say much about my character but I can tell you about the movie. It’s exactly what you’d expect of an Arnold comeback film. It’s Arnold doing what he does.Did you get to trade any one-liners with him?I don’t personally because he’s a cop and I’m an FBI agent, so we have two storylines, but what I did see — and I was there the days of [his shooting] — there’s a lot of chase sequences and what not. You really appreciate a different side of Arnold. You can see the seasoned side, and you can see a vulnerability and a humanity to him; as opposed to, you know, this other person, this action god-like thing who was Conan and Terminator and all these epic characters that weren’t, you know, real. This is real. This is real Arnold. This is him.Is he enjoying being back at work?He was wonderful. And it was wonderful to have him back. I’m such a super fan. It’s crazy.Casa de mi Padre is in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Schedule, Unbreakable, Mudbound, OneApp, 78th, Nat, Superheroe, Rom-Com","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/sadfr.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-genesis-rodriguez"},{"id":"47508846025002","title":"Five Favorite Films with Woody Harrelson","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Woody HarrelsonThe Hunger Games star also discusses hijinks on the set and his aversion to movie franchises.by Tim Ryan | March 22, 2012 |  CommentsWoody Harrelson is no stranger to eccentric characters; he’s played serial killers, pornographers, vigilante superheroes, and stoic zombie hunters. In The Hunger Games, he’s Haymitch Abernathy, an alcoholic former Hunger Games winner who mentors two young participants in the fine art of gladiatorial survival. In an interview with RT, the Oscar-nominated actor shared his favorite movies, and discussed his aversion to movie franchises and hi-jinks on the set of Hunger Games.Cool Hand Luke (Stuart Rosenberg, 1967; 100% Tomatometer)Probably my favorite is Cool Hand Luke. That’s kind of been my favorite for a while. I just love that movie.It’s funny because Josh Hutcherson also said Cool Hand Luke is one of his favorites.Oh, he did? Yeah, I think he’s got good taste.Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971; 85% Tomatometer)And then, probably Harold and Maude. I just think it’s this beautiful, complex love story between this kid and a much older lady. Just the performances, the direction… I don’t know, definitely one of the great movies. It’s wonderful, funny, emotional.The Graduate (Mike Nichols, 1967; 87% Tomatometer)Then The Graduate. It’s just one of the greatest comedies of all time. The way Dustin Hoffman is… You know, I guess that was his first big break and he just blew me away when I first saw that. Extraordinary performance, and you know, Mike Nichols. Just amazing, the way it’s shot; it’s just absolutely beautiful. And also, an incredible, quirky kind of love story.The Lives of Others (Florian Henckel-Donnersmarck, 2006; 93% Tomatometer)And then I love The Lives of Others. That’s just a powerful, riveting movie.One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (Milos Forman, 1975; 96% Tomatometer)And I’d put One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest on the list. I think it’s one of the great performances of Jack Nicholson. And also, kind of being up against the system, and trying to fight the system, the power structures that exist around him, and his fight for integrity and to bring some positivity to the other… I guess you’d call them inmates, in a sense, in the loony bin. I mean, to me, it’s just some of the best acting and some of the most inspiring — you know, with Milos Forman at the helm — one of the most inspiring stories.Next, Harelson talks about hijinks on the set and his aversion to movie franchises.&nbsp;You’ve been in movies that traverse apocalyptic wastelands — you know, Natural Born Killers and Zombieland — but you’ve also been in sports movies, like White Men Can’t Jump and Kingpin. Are you happy that finally they made a movie that brings both of those genres together?Woody Harrelson: [laughs] Oh, yeah, I’m psyched about it. I get a sense that it’s going to be a great film. I haven’t seen it yet, but everything I saw when we were shooting, as well as what I’ve heard from people who have seen it, I think it’ll be pretty amazing.You’ve never really been a franchise-movie guy before. What about The Hunger Games appealed to you?Yeah, I mean, even the word “franchise” makes me shudder a little bit, but this isn’t necessarily a franchise because the first one has to do well before they’re going to make a second one. But, you know, I read the books. I thought the books were just amazing and captivating, and to work with Gary Ross was also really alluring, because I think he’s a tremendous director. It kind of had everything. And a cool part, you know?So you read the books. How much research do you do before taking on a role? For, say, Rampart, did you hang out with cops?Oh, yeah. You know, I live in Hawaii, so I left, came into LA about a month, a month and a half before shooting just to do all that prep stuff. I tried to immerse myself in it, and hanging out with the cops was a really cool, helpful thing, and that probably helped me more than anything.If you’re doing something like The Hunger Games, aside from reading the books, what do you do to research or prepare?For The Hunger Games? Yeah, I read all the books, of course. I just tried to get a real sense of the character, and what wasn’t there in the book — I mean, that’s a pretty great tool — but what wasn’t there or what went outside of that, you kind of use your imagination for. But I guess a lot of the… You know, there were things that are going on between Gary and I, trying to figure out, “Well, you know, you played him really drunk in the last scene; why don’t you modify it a little bit here?” You know, always trying to get the right pitch for how inebriated Abernathy should be.Did you bond with the other actors when you were making the film?Oh, yeah. You know, I love these guys. Josh [Hutcherson] is… I’ve never seen a more cocksure 19-year-old in my life. He really is sure of himself and confident and smart and savvy and fun and cool, and not… You know, no matter how much press he gets, I can’t see him getting a big head about it. He’s really talented, and I do think the sky’s the limit, but I think he’s just going to remain one of the nicest guys I know. And Jen [Jennifer Lawrence] too, Jen was a lot of fun. They’re hysterical. It was just great hanging with these guys. They’d cut up all the time on set, and they’d always go into different characters, or pretending to be kittens playing with each other. Just wonderful fun.The Hunger Games opens in theaters this week.For more Hunger Games interviews, check out Five Favorite Films with Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, and Josh Hutcherson.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TV, BAFTA, scorecard, One, worst, It, book, kids","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/WoodyHarrelson.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-woody-harrelson"},{"id":"47508849282368","title":"Five Favorite Films with Aaron Eckhart","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Aaron EckhartPlus, The Rum Diary co-star on making the film, playing chaming bad guys, and staying in character -- and sober -- on set.by Luke Goodsell | November 1, 2011 |  CommentsYou could set your watch to Aaron Eckhart’s handsomely chiseled features — but do so at your own peril. As he’s proved time and again on screen, Eckhart excels at portraying deceptively charming men: be they manipulative executives (his breakout In the Company of Men), big-tobacco spin doctors (Thank You For Smoking), or literally, physically duplicitous district attorneys (The Dark Knight). Which isn’t to say he won’t play nice, reasonably normal guys, of course, as his excellent (and strangely Oscar-overlooked) performance in last year’s Rabbit Hole attests. This week, however, Eckhart’s up to his smooth-talking tricks in The Rum Diary, playing against Johnny Depp as the impeccably-dressed but otherwise rather rapacious Sanderson — an American businessman out to turn postcard-perfect Puerto Rico into a lucrative tourist resort. We spoke with Eckhart recently, where he talked about the film, his thoughts on writer Hunter S. Thompson, and the art of playing the likeable bad guy. But first, he ran through his five favorite films.Apocalypse Now (Francis Ford Coppola, 1979)My five favorite films? I have no memory, that’s my problem. [Laughs] Well one of them would be Apocalypse Now. I mean, you could tell that the movie was made in madness, as madness, and that, to me… someday I want to make a movie like that. Total consumption.Five Easy Pieces (Bob Rafelson, 1970)One of them would be… did I say Apocalypse Now? [Laughs] What other films are there? Have there been any other films? I would say Five Easy Pieces. Nicholson was a god. Is a god. Great movie. F—ing great movie.The Getaway (Sam Peckinpah, 1972)Then I’ll say — this is so easy, but I’ll say The Getaway, with McQueen. Just, you know, just raw power and action.Bringing Up Baby (Howard Hawks, 1938)Bringing Up Baby, with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn — just because I grew up on those movies.Midnight Express (Alan Parker, 1978)And then I’m gonna say… What’s a modern movie that I’ve seen? How about… you know a great movie that I saw was… [extremely long pause] Oh, I got a movie — the one where he goes to the Turkish Prison. Midnight Express. There you go. That movie terrified me. [Laughs] Go to Turkey, but do your hash before.Next, Eckhart on The Rum Diary, staying sober on set, and playing charming bad guys.&nbsp;Did you have a good time on the film?Aaron Eckhart: I did. I enjoyed working on a movie that Johnny’s in, and produced, and is so passionate about. And Hunter, you know — it was an opportunity to be a part of, I guess, Hunter’s legacy, in a way; Johnny’s sort of taking up that mantle. So it was a good time making the movie.Bruce Robinson said you were his first and only choice for Sanderson.Well I feel like it’s always an honor when people are thinking about you, especially when you don’t have any idea who they are, you know — in terms of, like, you don’t know that Bruce is thinking about you. Somebody who you’ve admired for years will say, “Oh I was thinking about you,” or “I’m gonna offer you a part,” and you say, “Well, I’d never think that you were thinking about me.” It’s always flattering, and it’s good to know. But I’d done these sorts of parts before, you know, where I play a sort of all-American businessman who’s unscrupulous — so I think Bruce felt like I could do it.“Cruel beauty” was his description of you.Cruel beauty, yeah. [Laughs]It’s kind of a compliment.Yeah. I think he’s talking about Sanderson. I think with Sanderson, you know, you’re developing paradise and you have a creative vision of how you’re gonna do that; you have to step on some toes and not everybody’s gonna like what you’re doing. I think that’s how the whole world’s been developed; some people love it and some people hate it. Plus, I mean the character’s written to define the protagonist, who’s Paul Kemp/Johnny, so my character was really set up to play the antithesis of Paul — in every way, from the way we dress, to our attitudes, and then have us come together and work together. So it’s sort of one of those characters where you’re set up to fail, but you’ve gotta play it with heart and soul.Do you find it challenging to play that kind of character?The challenge is that you have very little to work with, and you have to make him human and multidimensional — to make the audience conflicted and say, “Well, I like him, he’s charming, but I don’t like what he’s doing,” so they say, “Yeah, he’s the bad guy, but we like him anyway.” That’s probably the hardest thing about that. I think Giovanni [Ribisi] had the hardest part — he really had to put a lot of energy into that.It was quite a performance. You’ve had experience in playing this kind of charming character — in Thank You For Smoking, for example; though he was far more likeable. Had Bruce and Johnny seen that?Oh I’m sure, yeah. With Thank You, he was the protagonist, so he was given much more time. But in a role like this you don’t have that time; you have to get it across immediately. As soon as the audience sees you they have to be immediately able to form an opinion about you.I think you did it pretty well.Well, I did it. [Smiles]Were you a fan of Hunter’s before doing the film?Well, you know, I was familiar with Hunter. I certainly wasn’t an aficionado. I’d read some of his articles and his books early on when I went to college, [along with] Bukowski and all that, but I was refamiliarized through this movie — through reading the script and reading the book and then hearing stories from Johnny and listening to Bruce, and their research. So I am a fan of his. I’m intrigued by his lifestyle: how he managed to make it all work and be a professional at the same time.It’s quite a feat, when you think about it.Yeah. [Laughs] I mean, think about it yourself: trying to write, you know, and being completely bonko in this hotel room — and then trying to be coherent. Hunter had a pretty elite following, too — it’s not like he was writing for dummies. He was a very smart dude. I think everybody’s very intrigued by that lifestyle. And I think Johnny does it really well.Johnny and Bruce spoke of Hunter being a “presence” on the set, having his chair and his bottle there every day. Did you feel he was around?[Laughs] Oh yeah. I’m sure we made jokes about that. Bruce and Johnny had their morning ritual — I’m not sure if they told you about that?Dabbing themselves with rum before the shoot?Yeah.Did you partake?I didn’t.Your character’s meant to be relatively sober, I suppose.Yeah. [Laughs] Plus those guys, you know, when you’re the director and you’re number one and you’re the producer, it’s like — it’s almost like they had their own little club, you know. And that’s the way it should be, because they’re creating something — it’s a birth; they’re bringing life to something. I mean, I was there, but I enjoyed watching it. I thought it was a lot of fun. You don’t see that every day. Was it a bottle of Jack Daniels they had?Chivas Regal.Oh, Chivas Regal, yeah. Plus, I don’t drink.Which is all good for your character, to a certain extent — you don’t want to be part of the clique.No, you don’t want to be best friends with Johnny and his character, and all that sort of stuff. Although we had a really good time making the film. Like I said, you’re set up to go head-to-head. It’s an unlikely friendship that turns bad. You always find yourself, when you’re making movies — even if people say, “Well, I’m not a Method Actor” or whatever all that s— means — you always end up sort of playing your role in the movie. If you’re the bad guy, you’re the bad guy, you know what I mean? You naturally fall into those roles ’cause that’s what you’re hired to do. It sort of permeates your off time.The Rum Diary is in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"telelvision, on, free, American, zero","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/xvcv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-aaron-eckhart"},{"id":"47508849278270","title":"Five Favorite Films with Like Crazy Director Drake Doremus","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Like Crazy Director Drake DoremusThe Sundance award-winner gives us his favorite love stories.by RT Staff | November 4, 2011 |  CommentsYou may not recognize Drake Doremus’s name, but that’s likely because you probably haven’t seen any of his films. The 28-year-old Southern California native directed his first feature, Moonpie, in 2006, and his second film, Douchebag made its way to Sundance and a small theatrical release, but neither were big box office hits. Earlier this year, however, his latest film, Like Crazy, picked up the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, marking him as a young independent director to watch. Starring Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones as a young couple trying to navigate the tricky waters of an international romance, Like Crazy has received some impressive reviews thus far, leading to a Certified Fresh stamp. We asked Drake to name his Five Favorite Films, to which he responded by narrowing it down to his five favorite love stories. Read on for the full list!Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004; 93% Tomatometer)Not only is it one of my favorite love stories of all time, I feel it’s a generation-defining romance that breaks my heart every time I see it. Impossible to get through without crying.Breaking the Waves (Lars von Trier, 1996; 86% Tomatometer)Certainly hard to watch at times but impossible to look away from. Emily Watson’s performance leaves me devastated. Feeling that much love for someone is just as painful as it is joyous. What a film.Head-On (Fatih Akin, 2004; 90% Tomatometer)Ok, this film is everything that I think a good love story is. It’s intense, profound and full of discovery. Definitely the most unpredictable love story I have ever seen. Director Fatih Akin’s bold direction and straightforward storytelling make this one of my favorite love stories of all time.A Place in the Sun (George Stevens, 1951; 75% Tomatometer)Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor’s chemistry is a benchmark for me. I first saw this in film school and it changed the way I make movies forever.Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971; 85% Tomatometer)What an original and resonating film. I love watching this one anytime, anyplace. Its originality, tone and understanding of the human connection is breathtaking.The Certified Fresh Like Crazy is currently in theaters in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"golden, Disney, a, TCA, and, screen, television, action, Paramount, telelvision, Guide","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2323.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-like-crazy-director-drake-doremus"},{"id":"47508849286465","title":"Five Favorite Films with Puss in Boots","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Puss in BootsDreamWorks lets the cat out of the bag.by Puss in Boots | October 28, 2011 |  CommentsI don’t know you, but I’d like to.

Though he’s best known for his multi-Emmy-winning role as a highbrow, fastidious shrink on Frasier, Pierce has carved out a distinctive career on stage (he won a Tony Award for his starring role in the musical Curtains in 2007) and as a voice actor (key roles in A Bug’s Life, Treasure Planet, and The Simpsons). In the psychological thriller The Perfect Host, Pierce plays a man preparing for a dinner party when an escaped fugitive turns up at his door; what follows is as twisty as a corkscrew, and audiences expecting good ol’ Niles are in for a surprise. In an interview with RT, Pierce shared his favorite films, and discussed his juicy role in The Perfect Host, how he prepares for a role, and the legacy of Frasier.&nbsp;Bonnie and Clyde (1967, 89% Tomatometer)I would say… It’s a really hard question to answer, first of all, because there are so many great films, and it’s hard to pick just a few. But certainly, Bonnie and Clyde is one. It’s perfectly cast, beautifully shot, and that ballet of death at the end was something unlike anything I’d ever seen before. [Everyone in the cast] were incredible. Estelle Parsons, oh my gosh.The Godfather (1972, 100% Tomatometer)The Godfather. The palette of the movie, the colors. There’s something about the production design and the cinematography. Everything about that. I mean, I like the story, the characters, all that, but the thing, when I think of the movie — like if I’m flipping channels and it’s on, I have to stop and watch it — the thing that catches me is always just its rich, rich, rich deep palette. It’s incredible. I mean, they’re all great films, the first one especially. When I was a kid and it was on TV, I would always have to go make spaghetti and watch it. I could not watch that movie without having spaghetti and tomato sauce. There was just something so evocative about those guys making sauce in the kitchen.Horror of Dracula (1958,89% Tomatometer)Horror of Dracula. First of all, the match up of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee was so brilliant. They were so great together. Plus, the ending — I hate to say this, because you’ve to see it — when Dracula has Van Helsing at his mercy, and the sun’s come up outside, and Van Helsing tears down the curtains, so the sun comes streaming in, and then takes two candlesticks and forms a cross. It’s just so cool. And I think that’s the first time anybody ever did that in a movie; now they do all kinds of versions of that thing. But I just thought that was pretty brilliant writing.Unfinished Piece for a Player Piano (1977,N/A)I will give you Unfinished Piece for the Player Piano. Oh, it’s a great movie. It’s a Russian movie; [Nikita] Mikhalkov is the director, and it’s a Checkhov play, really — it’s based on Platonov. Chekhov is unbelievably difficult to do, to capture the mood, to capture the humor, the incredible sadness and pathos of the characters, all that. It’s very rare that you see a great production of Checkhov. I saw this when I was rehearsing a production of The Cherry Orchard. The great British director Peter Brook was directing, and he set up a screening of this movie for us. It’s just, it’s also a beautiful movie to look at, and also it was a great director, but it’s the characters, both the acting and the depiction of this wonderful, very specific group of Russian characters is unmatched.A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy (1982, 71% Tomatometer)Last one is A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy. I don’t think it’s up there on most people’s lists. I just think it’s so beautiful. It’s very funny, but very gentle, and it also deals with issues of life and death in a very serious way. I can remember every time I saw it crying at the end. And part of it, too, is [Woody Allen] makes this incredibly good use of Mendelssohn’s music. I think the entire score is — I’m not sure about the soundtrack — but the score is Mendelssohn. I just think it’s a really exquisite piece of filmmaking.Next, Pierce talks what audiences expect of him, how he prepares for a role, and the legacy of Frasier.On to The Perfect Host. I know there’s only so much people want to give away about the movie itself, but I think my first thought watching it was, “This is pretty unpredictable.”David Hyde Pierce: Good! That’s excellent. That is definitely meant to be unpredictable. Every time you think you know where you are, it should change, and every time you think you know who someone is, that should change. I think the cool thing is that also happens to the characters in the movie as well.It’s funny because watching it, I’m like, “Oh, I think I know where this is going.” And then, all of a sudden, we see a side of you that we haven’t seen much before. Did you enjoy upending audience expectations in this movie?I love the character to begin with. I think any actor would love to play this character. But it’s a really nice ride for me, because it does sort of start out meeting the audience’s expectations if you’re familiar with my work. The beginning of the movie is very much what you might be used to. And then, I sort of depart from that pretty extremely. I think it worked well for the movie, because I think it helps lull the audience into sort of saying, “Oh yeah, I remember this guy. We’ve seen him before.”[rtimage]siteImageId=10244427[/rtimage]I don’t know if you still feel this way, but I’ve read you’ve always felt like theater was number one for you. But one of the things that came to mind as I watched this was that it has a sort of theatrical feel, in the sense that it feels a little bit like, say, Rope, where it’s cinematic, obviously, but there are these people who are trying to maintain some sort of veneer of respectability within a contained space while there are scary things going on underneath. Would you say that’s part of what the appeal was for you?It’s funny; you are not the first person to say that about it, and it’s something I did not get at all, reading the script. What appealed to me was the character, the story, the back and forth between the actors. What ended up being very theatrical about it, though, was that we had such a tight shooting schedule, only 17 days. We had four days of rehearsal, which doesn’t always happen on a movie, where Clayne Crawford, who plays opposite me, and Nick Tomnay, the director, and I got to really work through the characters, work through the emotional arcs of the characters, figure out what the physicality of the whole thing would be. And then, because there wasn’t a lot of time, it was a chance to really have good long scenes, and long interchanges between the actors. You know, I don’t know that it’s theatrical so much as, maybe we’re not used to that kind of thing. Filmmaking has become so much about quick cuts and jiggly cameras and stuff like that that maybe it just harkens back to an older style of filmmaking.This is Nick Tomnay’s first major feature as a director. When you’re working with a “newbie,” how do you approach the material?What I did was, I met with Nick, and I had seen a short film that he’d made on which The Perfect Host was based, and seeing his work in that format and having conversations with him, that’s all I really needed. I liked him, I trusted him, and he really understood the film because he’d written it. From that point on, it didn’t change the way I prepared for the film, and when we were on the set, all of my expectations were borne out. He was amazing. It’s a very high pressure situation, directing your first feature — no time, very little money, things go wrong, and he handled everything. He constantly kept a serious voice, focused creativity and support on the set, and that was amazing, I think, for a first-time director.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244428[/rtimage]Shooting something in 17 days shows discipline.Discipline and also, he really knew what he wanted. When you have that kind of time available, you can’t just shoot endlessly. You know, you have to budget, and then figure it out in editing. Which is not to say he was stuck; because he knew exactly what he wanted, he could change and improvise and throw stuff out, because he had the overall shape of the piece in his head.Shifting gears slightly, I’m sure you get this all the time, but I wonder? Obviously, you’re best known for playing Niles Crane on Frasier. When people come up to you and say, “I loved you on that show,” or “Hey Niles!”, does it get old? Have you accepted that as part of what the public perceives you as?I love it. I love it. People are very affectionate. The kind of thing you have on a long-running television show like that is very particular. It really has to do with affection; it’s not star worship. People feel like you’re a friend, they feel like you’re a family member. Some people grew up watching the show, some people’s parents watched the show, some people’s — God help us — grandparents watched the show, you know. So it doesn’t get old, but I do.One of the things I’ve read you saying is that Frasier felt like doing an Oscar Wilde play on television. That’s kind of something high to shoot for, especially in the world of TV. Are you still surprised how popular it was, given how it was a bit smarter than a lot of other stuff going on at the time?No, I don’t think it was smarter; I think it was really good writing, and I think it holds up. If you see a rerun now, it’s still funny. It wasn’t tied to contemporary references or jokes about what was going on in the press at the time. It was very carefully written by really, really skillful writers. And that’s the Oscar Wilde comparison, I would say. It was a great cast — I wouldn’t take anything away from the acting, which I think was also pretty good — but I really feel that the core of that show [was the writing]. And the incredible thing about it is, for 11 years, it sustained a really, really, really high level of writing.What are you doing next? Are you working on any plays right now?I’m in pre-production; I’m going to direct a musical, a new musical. We’ll do that in the fall. And then, I’m going to be acting in a play in New York, the Manhattan Theatre Club in New York, at the end of the year.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244429[/rtimage]You’ve done theater, you’ve done voice acting, you’ve done TV, you’ve done movies. Do you approach everything based on what the assignment is, or is there any similarities underneath everything?I’ll tell you, I wouldn’t have been able to answer that question, except now that I’m directing for the first time, I use the same exact process that I use when I approach any part, which is, I’ll do anything. I will explore any avenue; I will do research on any aspect of the character. I’ll go to see a concert, I’ll go to the museum and look at paintings. Walking down the street, some person does something that gives me an idea. A dog does something that gives me an idea. You never know. If I’m going to talk about my approach, it is to open myself to influence that might spark something about a character or about a show.So, for example, when you were doing, say, A Bug’s Life, did you read up on insects or visit museums?No, I didn’t do that. That’s a little bit what I’m saying; in that case, the script was the script. I didn’t have to physically act out things. I was just sort of reading a script. But, I guess what I’m saying is that I try to do not just what you would literally expect, not the most obvious things. I did a play in London last year, and it took place back in the 1600s, so I went to a museum and looked at paintings from the 1600s that were about scenes that had nothing to do with the play. Because I knew everything about what life was like on stage in the scenes that we had. What I didn’t know was, what happens when these people go home? Or what happens when they go out to drink? So, that kind of stuff, because those are the things you wouldn’t expect. You never know what it might tell you about the character.What did you do for your character in The Perfect Host?I spent a lot of time talking to myself.The Perfect Host opens in limited release Friday.

In his latest, Redemption Road, Duncan plays Augy, a Shakespeare-quoting country music fan with a dark past who helps Jefferson (Morgan Simpson), a troubled young bluesman, to settle his late grandfather’s estate. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Duncan shared some of his favorite movies, and talked about his favorite cartoon character, the misconceptions about his size, and his role in one of Major League Baseball’s most infamous nights.RT: What are some of your favorite movies?Michael Clarke Duncan: I’d have to say The Ten Commandments. Charlton Heston. Heston was unbelievable. Man, for me, to act like that in such a prolific film is unbelievable to see. I can sit and watch that over and over and over and over again. You can’t get better than Charlton Heston. He was just unbelievable in that film, that’s all. Of course, I do — and this is going to sound weird – I like Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. I like his movies, like Commando. I love Conan the Barbarian. I love that. I love to watch Armageddon. It’s one of my favorite movies. The Green Mile is another favorite movie of mine.I really don’t have favorites; I’m just a fan of movies, period. When I get the chance, I’m at the theaters all the time, trying to check out the latest movies. I’m just a fan of great movies, so I can’t really say which five. I’m a fan of all movies.Speaking of favorites, you play a country music fan who’s paired up with a bluesman in Redemption Road. Which do you prefer: blues or country?You know, it’s funny because I can’t say I was a hardcore fan of one or the other. They both send the same message to me. They’re both about life. One just comes from an African-American perspective, and one comes from a white perspective. But I think at certain times, you have these country songs that make you go, “Oh, I like what he’s saying.” Then when you hear a blues song, say, a B.B. King song, then it’s a similar thing. So I can’t say that I like blues better than country, or I like Country better than Blues. They’re both good to me. They’re both good, and sometimes I listen to both of them.&nbsp;Duncan with Morgan Simpson in Redemption RoadChicago is known as a great place for blues. Did you listen to blues growing up?More so jazz, more so contemporary things like James Brown. So you know, in my neighborhood, you heard James Brown a lot, the Temptations, the Floaters, things of that nature. I came up during that time when music, to me, was really music. It wasn’t about talking about a woman and calling them a derogatory name or something like that. It was real music. The old days — L.T.D., I met Jeffrey Osborne in the airport last week at LAX; man, big fan of his. Singing “Love Ballad,” which is one of my favorites, like probably the number one song that I love. So there are a lot of things that I can look back and say had an influence on me as a moviegoer, listening to music in particular.What initially attracted you to Redemption Road?Well, you know, it’s interesting, the things that may attract you to a movie or a certain project. First of all, it was different. It wasn’t a big time action movie, a big budget movie, it wasn’t a part where, you know, I’m beating somebody up. It’s a guy who has to deal with some truths about himself, and who has to fix something, who has to fix something in order to keep living his life. This thing that’s bothering this guy, it’s tearing him to pieces, it’s something really tragic, and he’s trying to make amends. And when you try to make amends with something, you have to find yourself first and you have to be truthful with yourself first. This guy’s truthful with himself, and he’s coming to help Bailey [Morgan Simpson] to be truthful also. So I have to say Morgan Simpson, who stars as Bailey and also wrote it, and working with the great Mario Van Peebles as a director, really attracted me to this movie, and doing something different in my career. You know, taking a chance on a movie such as this.You’re also a co-producer Redemption Road. Is it a difficult thing when you’re working on a project and you’ve got a bigger role in its production?No. You know, I had input into everything, but once I was concentrating on building Augy, which is my character, once I was focused on building that, I didn’t worry about the other ancillary things on the outside. Mario Van Peebles and Morgan Simpson took care of that, and we had a tone of very good executive producers. Charlie Poe was another one out of Tampa. And once I got into that, I didn’t worry about the other things. Every morning Mario Van Peebles would come to my trailer, and we would talk over the production thing or we would go over the script, and he was right on time with everything that he did, as far as the movie was concerned. So I didn’t really worry about the production side as much as you might think, because I had so much to study for in developing this character and making this movie to be a really good movie.&nbsp;Duncan in Redemption RoadThere’s a running gag in the movie that every time Jefferson loses you, and he loses you a lot, he’s always like, “Hey, did you see the big guy? Where’s the big guy?” Do you sometimes feel like you’re typecast as the big guy, or does being the big guy open certain doors for you?You know, it’s a little bit of both. It’s a little bit of both. I think that, when you’re a big person, they’re going to typecast you. I’ll put it like this: Once I did The Green Mile, they’d typecast me as a gentle giant, which, to me, is ridiculous. I mean, it was a role that I played, but you have to get out of that because you don’t want everybody going, “Oh, he’s just a gentle giant. Those are soft roles.” And I don’t want nobody thinking I’m a soft actor. So it was a thing that, once you get stuck, it’s like mud. I broke out of that rut, because I took things that were different. And sometimes it helps you, and sometimes it hurts you, because people see that. The Green Mile was such a great movie, and I can tell you it’s great because I really, truly believe that that year, 1999-2000, it was the best movie out, bar none. You know, I will put that movie up against any movie that was out at that time, or any movie, period. But the thing that’s happened is people see you as being seven feet tall, 400 pounds, and I’ll tell you, if I was seven feet and 400 or 300 pounds, or 250 or 260, I’d probably just be retiring from the NBA with a stellar career, and probably right behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, as far as points. I would have had so much money that I’d probably have my own private island, my own grills like George Foreman did, I would have so many things going. But everybody sees me… When they see me — I’m like 6’4, 6’5 — they go, “Wow, I thought you were taller.” I’m like, “No, I’m not. I’m not taller, I’m not bigger.” And I weigh 280 now! Some people saw that John Coffey, when I filmed that movie, I weighed 360. But it’s a big difference from 360 to 280. And when people see me, they’re like, “Huh? You’re smaller…” and I’m like, “Well, what did you think?” They saw a giant. They thought I was bigger than Shaquille O’Neal and heavier and walking around, so when people see me, I guess that’s disappointing when that isn’t so. It kind of sticks with you, the movie that you do. It was like when I saw Al Pacino, I wanted him to do Scarface, I wanted him to do Tony Montana. I didn’t ask him that, but deep down I just wanted him to say a couple lines from that, which was stupid. I would never do that, but I did think it, though. His career, probably, he’ll be known as Tony Montana, because he played that role so good. Whenever I look at… people put my name somewhere, they say “From The Green Mile.” They never say “From Daredevil” or Armageddon or The Scorpion King, you know, or Sin City, See Spot Run; they never say those movies. They always say “From The Green Mile.”With a small movie like Redemption Road, do you consciously say, “Okay, I like these bit parts in the big movies, but now I gotta switch things up and I’m going to do a little movie like this,” or is it that you particularly like a story and decide to go with it?It’s a combination of both things you said. I do say, “Okay, I’m going to switch something up, I want to do something different.” But it’s also a positive when the story is good. So it’s both of those things. Both of those things I look at every time. Like if any movie, you know, just doesn’t have the money, but it has a good cast, you could do any movie that has a good cast. It’s not paying any money, they’re paying everybody the same thing across the board, but the script is good, or you want to work with certain actors, or you want to work with a certain director. I mean, who wouldn’t want to work with Mario Van Peebles, and he said, “Hey, we don’t have a lot of money, but you’re going to be one of the stars of this movie.” Of course! You know, if Steven Spielberg did an independent movie, how many people do you think would line up? So, I think it’s a combination of both of those things you said. The script and the type of role that you’re going for; those two things really come into play. And then the third thing is the director.Speaking of Daredevil and Sin City, I read that you were a big comic book fan growing up. Is there a superhero you’d want to play if you had the chance?Oh yeah. I’d want to play Panthro from ThunderCats. I like Panthro. I always have. He was cool, he did the nunchucks. I think I’d have to work on my nunchuck skills; when I was younger, I hit myself on the head with some nunchucks. But Panthro from ThunderCats. I know they’re going to do a ThunderCats movie, and they’re apparently working on a show right now. I think Panthro would really suit me. I think I could really embellish that role.I can’t see you as Orko anyway.[laughs] Thanks, brother.Do you have any idea what’s going on with Sin City 2?I haven’t heard anything, but I think they finally get the funding together, and hopefully Robert Rodriguez will give me a call. Right now I am working on a contract with FOX to do 13 episodes of The Finder, which will be coming out January 5th, right after American Idol on FOX. But after that, I probably will, unless they order another nine episodes – you know, 22, fingers crossed – I’ll be ready for whatever. I’m ready to act, I’m ready to work. I love working, and I’m sure if they call me, we can work around my schedule or something can happen. But I would love to be in Sin City 2.&nbsp;Duncan with Colin Farrell in DaredevilI know this is a little off topic, but I have to ask because I’m a huge baseball fan. I understand you attended the craziest baseball game in the history of the major leagues.That’s right, that’s right. Disco Demolition Night, baby.What on earth was that like? I read about that and I thought, “That sounds like anarchy!”[laughs] Go on the internet and look it up. They got tons of videos. And it was a thing that… I think it was Steve Dahl or some radio DJ back in the day in the 1970s, he said it was the end of disco, and he was going to blow up all these disco records. So he had this army fatigues stuff on, in a jeep, and he was, like, a commander, and he detonated — I think the White Sox were playing Detroit at old Comiskey Park – and he detonated these disco records. But when he detonated it, the fires started happening, and all of a sudden, people just started running onto the field. I remember a friend of mine – I can’t recall his name — he just jumped from right field, which was a lot higher than it is now. All we saw was him going to the end and climbing over, and him running onto the field, and we were like, “That is a drop. That’s a good drop.” And I remember him stopping and just doing his hand like, “Come on!” And the adrenaline took over. We all jumped from that right field corner, and we all just ran up to the field and I remember sliding into second base and thinking it was a lot harder than it looked on TV. By this time, people were setting fires, people were stealing stuff. It looked like a war-torn country. That’s what it looked like. And nobody… you had black, white, Mexican, everybody… We were just on the field, and we were doing something that we shouldn’t have been doing. Now that I think back, I should have picked up second base and tried to steal that, because everybody was taking stuff, but I didn’t though. I went and slid into second and I rounded third, and I was going to do that and go home. I slid into home, and there was a bat laying there. And I picked up the bat. I was there for Disco Demolition Night in 1979, and I think that was one of the most fun times — every time I look at it on the internet, I just start laughing because I think of all the stuff that we did out there on that field.Can you find yourself on YouTube? Are you visible in any of the clips?No, there are too many people out there. [laughs] I look for myself all the time, but there were so many people out there. And the police were called in, and they had billy clubs, and people were running around… you swore it was a prison riot. That’s what it looked like: a prison riot on the yard. But once the police came in, by that time, the game was out of control. The second game of the doubleheader didn’t get played. The field was destroyed. I remember [White Sox broadcaster] Harry Caray on the PA saying [does Harry Caray impression” “Please, everybody! Get off the field! We have a game to play here!” Wasn’t nobody thinking about that. Fans ran to the dugout — we were looking for gloves, balls — people were throwing stuff, running with their shirts off, and just screaming for no apparent reason. I think it was 99 percent men out there — I didn’t see too many women. But it was on Channel 32 in Chicago, they were showing the White Sox game, and boy, did we have stories to tell when we got back. We were just so elated, because we were on the field at the old Comiskey Park! That was our thing. We didn’t know it was gonna be history.After all that, I’m sure you appreciate the irony that you narrated the official 2005 White Sox World Series film.[laughs] Yeah, you know what? When they called me I said, “Wow, how funny is this?” Now I’m this actor and they want me to do a voiceover, and they don’t know I was running around those bases so hard at old Comiskey Park. I mean, from home, to first, to second, to all the way back to home. I just wanted to see what it felt like to run around those bases. So when they called me it was very ironic, but very fun.Redemption Road opens this weekend in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"A&E, Kaling, nfl, Pictures, Reality, Schedule","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ewrw.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-michael-clarke-duncan"},{"id":"47508849311052","title":"Five Favorite Films with Jason Momoa","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Jason MomoaThe new Conan also talks about the film and how he wanted to be a painter.by Ryan Fujitani | August 19, 2011 |  CommentsRaised in Iowa by way of Honolulu and born of German, Irish, Native Hawaiian and Native American blood, Jason Momoa first turned heads as Hawaii’s Model of the Year in 1999, thanks to his imposing stature and exotic looks. This success led directly to his first acting gig on Baywatch: Hawaii, which he followed up with a few small films and another TV series, but his true breakout came in the role of Ronon Dex on Stargate: Atlantis. Most recently, Momoa was seen in the popular HBO series Game of Thrones, a bona fide sword-and-sandal fantasy drama, which gave audiences a taste of what he might bring to Marcus Nispel’s Conan the Barbarian as the titular Cimmerian warrior.Though some might be quick to dismiss Momoa as simply another action star stepping into an established franchise, he was only too eager to talk about his longstanding affection for the classic Robert E. Howard character. A self-professed art and movie lover, Momoa also found it near impossible to narrow down his Five Favorite Films, speaking with overwhelming enthusiasm about his favorite actors and the writers and artists who have inspired him. Read on to see what he had to say about his favorite movies, his new film, and his ultimate career aspirations.&nbsp;The Shining (1980, 88% Tomatometer)I’d say The Shining. One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest. I’m a huge Jack Nicholson fan. He’s obviously… Everything from Five Easy Pieces, another one that’s just phenomenal to me… Yeah, he’s a god to me. I love him. I don’t know how to properly explain why, but he’s just fantastic. His sense of humor, his intensity, his charm, you know. There’s only one Jack. I love him.A Streetcar Named Desire (1951, 98% Tomatometer)A Streetcar Named Desire is one of my ultimate favorites. Brando’s amazing. Brando’s one of my favorites.The Last of the Mohicans (1992, 97% Tomatometer)Last of the Mohicans was like my childhood favorite. I love that movie. The soundtrack to that is probably one of my favorite in the world. My favorite movie is probably the life of Daniel Day-Lewis. If you watched Gangs of New York, it sucked, but then you see him as Bill the Butcher, it’s unbelievable. You really want to say Gangs of New York because he’s so amazing, but then you want to say There Will Be Blood. I mean, really, he’s so amazing. My Left Foot, Last of the Mohicans; the guy is just a freak of nature. He’s like a national treasure. That’s what he should be considered. Mindblowing, absolutely mindblowing. I can’t wait to see him play Lincoln. Anything Daniel Day-Lewis is in, that’s pretty much my favorite movie.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998, 50% Tomatometer)Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is one of my favorites. I love the book. Terry Gilliam is phenomenal. I love Terry Gilliam, I just love his mind. I love that, you know, he doesn’t even do drugs. The guy’s just f***ing crazy. Absolutely mad genius, and I love him to pieces. So, Fear and Loathing, to make that book come true, I mean, I can’t think of another book that would be harder.So you were a fan of the book before the film.Oh yeah, I’m a huge Hunter S. Thompson fan, and I’m a big Charles Bukowski fan. So that’s the thing. My movies stem from people that have influenced my life, like Rimbaud, Beaudelaire, you know, the great writers… and painters. I’m attracted to artist films, whether they be biographies or stuff like that; I’m just more attracted to that.Midnight Express (1978, 95% Tomatometer)Midnight Express is so… That and A Woman under the Influence were the first two movies I ever watched and went, “That is not a movie.” You do not see anyone going, “Cut! I’ll be in my f***ing trailer!” You watch that s*** and you are like, you are in that. So Midnight Express; that is really great filmmaking.Next, Momoa talks about his love for the arts, his respect for the Conan legacy, and how he wanted to make the character his own.RT: A lot of your favorite films feature standout performances from notable leading men. Is that something that strongly influences your movie taste?Jason Momoa: Not entirely, because I myself write and direct, too. I want to go off directors, too. You know, originally growing up, some movies are alright, but you see performances that blow them away. Like Barfly; I loved [Mickey Rourke] in that. Watch Rumble Fish, it’s f***ing amazing. I love Rourke’s performances; I mean, some of them are really fantastic.I mean, there’s so many more. My mom raised me with Rear Window and Gone with the Wind, you know what I mean? I was raised by someone who loved cinema. Midnight Express, State of Grace, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I always liked Raging Bull; that’s kind of a no-brainer. You know, Basquiat and Pollock are very influential to me.You seem to be a fan of the arts in general. Was acting something you knew you wanted to do at an early age?I think I wanted to do more of the arts. I really wanted to be a painter. I love the arts. Music, writing, directing… I think acting is phenomenal, because you get to be a student of life, you know? I can be anything I want to be, and I love that. Actors have to study life. It’s really fun. I mean, I’m a nice guy dad, and I’m playing a barbarian that slays and lops people’s heads off!Truth be told, I don’t want to play a superhero; I love Conan. He’s an antihero. If I’m going to play otherworldy heroes, you know… He fights, he f***s, he loves women, he loves to drink, he’s a pirate, he’s a thief, he wanders alone through this crazy world, he’s a king, he’s a soldier. At the end of the day, every man in the f***ing world would follow him. If s*** hit the fan, it’s like, “I’m going with that guy. Whatever, Batman; it’s cool, man. I’m going with that guy.”&nbsp;How familiar were you with the legacy of Conan?I was really familiar, because I was a big comic book geek. Both of my parents were painters, so I grew up with a… [Conan artist] Frank Frazetta really captured a world and elegance and movement and raw power in his paintings, and it inspired generations to read those novels and read those short stories. I wanted to take Frank Frazetta off of the canvas and make him me. That was my Conan, you know, the Dark Horse comics.When I read Robert E. Howard’s work, I really find Conan to be like a lion or panther. He’s a product of his environment, you know. He’s the king of his jungle. I wanted him to be this lion, the way he prowls and stalks. And I’m a big fan of Akira Kurosawa, so I wanted to study all those samurai movies, just because I wanted him to have that code of honor, and at the same time, that intensity and grace. It’s like, he’s not barbaric; he’s extremely witty and he moves very smoothly. He’s dynamic. So I wanted to incorporate that.And I did a lot of study on Geronimo and Cochise and the Apache Wars. I wanted to have that level of spirit. I think, you know, when you learn about Geronimo and the things that he went through and how his family died, you can understand his pain and where he’s coming from and what he’s fighting against.I’m not all that familiar with the source material myself; is the story in this new film an adaptation of an existing Conan story, or is it completely original?Yeah, it’s a collage of a couple Robert E. Howard stories and some comic book stories. I think that’s what we were really trying to honor. There were really no ideas to remake the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. You know, there’s eight decades of source material to go off of, so I think we’re really just here to kind of reimagine that whole franchise. Obviously it would have to start with an origin story; there’s 30 years of fans who may not know who the hell he is. So we had to start at ground zero, just understanding that, you know, he’s born on the battlefield, he’s cut out of his mother’s belly, and he tastes her blood before her breastmilk, and then he was raised as this gifted warrior. He had to watch his father die in front of his face, and he was raised with wolves, and the guy’s just a true warrior. And when you catch up with me, I’m in my pirate days and having fun and f***ing women and drinking, you know, just being a degenerate, which he was, and that’s fun. But also you see him come across someone who killed his father, and the tides shift, and he’ll do whatever it takes to track him down. In the meantime, he comes across a woman and uses her as an object to get what he wants, and, you know, finds something deeper.[Note: The following paragraph contains a spoiler]We shot a couple different endings. I wanted to have her die, just because turmoil always follows this guy, but we chose for her to live.&nbsp;Were you involved in the screenwriting process?Yeah, I was involved in it. It was a very complicated process, but I think later when Conan 2 comes out, I want to take a stab at writing the second one. I think I have a couple good ideas what I want to do with it.The Conan movies of the early 1980s were kind of a turning point in Arnold Schwarzenegger’s career, and after those, he became this huge action star. I know you enjoy writing and directing, but is that a path you’re looking to follow?I mean, I enjoy playing characters in action films, but Drogo [from Game of Thrones] didn’t do any action, really — it was all character-based — and Conan is the farthest thing from who I am, so that’s fun to play. The next things, the ones that are all action-based… Once again, I?ve never shot a gun before, and now [in Bullet to the Head] I’m playing this assassin. You know, that stuff comes easy, but I want to do it character-based; I don’t want to regurgitate the same acting within some action stuff. I don’t want to be that guy. You know, Arnold plays Arnold, and Stallone plays Stallone; it’s a trade. I don’t want to find myself doing that.I want to do these small movies. I want to go to festivals. I want to create and be a painter, you know, I want to paint movies and write stories. You do it because you love it. I’m not there to make money; I want to do it because, as an artist, I want to make movies. So that’s where I want to go; I lean more towards directing.Conan the Barbarian (2011) opens this weekend in the US.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Turner","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ffdsf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-jason-momoa"},{"id":"47508851040591","title":"Five Favorite Films with Footloose Director Craig Brewer","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Footloose Director Craig BrewerThe Hustle &amp; Flow writer/director explains why he took on the 1980s remake.by Ryan Fujitani | August 3, 2011 |  CommentsDirector Craig Brewer made a big splash at Sundance back in 2005 when his first major feature, Hustle &amp; Flow, won an Audience Award. That film, about a Memphis pimp who tries his hand at the rap game, later turned more heads when its signature track, “It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp,” earned Three 6 Mafia the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the first ever to be awarded to a hip hop group. Brewer followed up in 2007 with another gritty tale set in the South, Black Snake Moan, starring Christina Ricci as a battered nymphomaniac and Samuel L. Jackson as the troubled farmer who rescues her from the side of the road. Though it didn’t prove to be quite the critical darling that Hustle &amp; Flow was, Black Snake Moan saw its fair share of supporters, who touted its blend of strong acting, skillful direction, and fantastic use of a killer blues soundtrack.With all that in mind, it was a bit puzzling to some when it was announced that Brewer’s next film would be a remake of the 1980s pop culture classic Footloose. Ostensibly a teen movie about dancing, Footloose seemed out of place for a filmmaker who had previously focused on pimps, prostitutes, and nymphomaniacs. RT recently had the opportunity to chat with Brewer, who not only gave us his Five Favorite Films, but also went on to explain passionately why he signed on to the Footloose remake, what he changed in his version, and how it does, in fact, fit within his wheelhouse.&nbsp;Matewan (1987, 100% Tomatometer)First of all, I would say John Sayles’s Matewan. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen it — and by the way, you should, because it’s a really incredible film — but it was one of those things where my Aunt Mary Jean from Knoxville, Tennessee sat me down and said, “You need to see this movie.” It’s by the same guy who did this other movie called Brother from Another Planet, but this movie’s really one of the best strike movies. It had James Earl Jones, Chris Cooper in his first movie, and Mary McDonnell. It’s got an incredible cast, but it’s just got a lot of soul. It’s really one of my favorite movies.The Blues Brothers (1980, 85% Tomatometer)The Blues Brothers was a big movie for me, because I was about 13 to 14 years old, and it was my first introduction to James Brown, my first introduction to Aretha Franklin. I knew about Murph and the Magic Tones, which was made up of Booker T and the MGs, essentially. Steve Cropper and “Duck” Dunn, the two guys in there, they were two members of Booker T and the MGs, and then the drummer, you know, he’s got one of my favorite lines in movie history; his name’s Willie Hall. There’s this great line where Willie Hall goes, “Jake, Elwood, you’re out of prison, things are lookin’ good for you. You got the money you owe us, mother f***er?” That’s Willie Hall. He actually plays at my kids’ birthday parties here in Memphis, Tennessee. But, it was a movie that just had the… I mean, my dad and I watched that, and the whole scene where the nun is just beating them up; I’ve never seen my dad laugh so hard. It’s an electrifying, fun movie, and Steven Spielberg makes a cameo at the end of it.The Celebration (1998, 92% Tomatometer)I would say that Thomas Vinterberg’s The Celebration was probably one of the most influential movies for me to be a filmmaker. I had seen a lot of how-to movies in the past, but there was something about how unapologetic that movie was to be filmed on a video camera. They had all these rules because of the Dogme 95 rules, where you couldn’t have a tripod, you know, you can’t bring in lights, you can’t use props that aren’t already there, you can’t use music, and I thought, “Well, this movie’s going to suck.” I went to see it, and I was riveted, and it was like that moment where I kind of sat at a coffee shop — I saw it in Washington D.C., I was there on a trip — and I just sat there thinking, “The only reason you’re not a filmmaker right now is because you’re not going out and doing it, because these people just made something with a camera that’s sh**tier than yours, and it’s brilliant.” So, “The only reason you’re not a filmmaker is not because people aren’t giving you money, or giving you a break. It’s because you’re not good enough, or you’re not doing it.” So that was a very important movie for me.You ended up making your first feature, The Poor and Hungry, in sort of the same fashion, didn’t you?Oh yeah, that was the movie that kicked my ass. I made my first feature in 1998, or I started making it in 1998, and then I saw The Celebration, and I was like, “I’m doing my movie wrong. I need to just celebrate the performances and make them good, not try to bring in a damn dolly track just for the sake of bringing in a dolly track. I can’t even afford a dolly track. Why would I want to do it?” So that was a really big, important movie to me.The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957, 96% Tomatometer)The Bridge on the River Kwai was one of those movies that my father and I watched for the first time, and he prefaced it by saying, “You’re probably not going to like this movie now, but you’re going to understand it later.” [laughs] And I remember watching it with that I mind — because I was young — and now I’m at the end of… You know, my dad is no longer with me, and I look at Alec Guinness’s character in it, and I now understand him. Where, at a point earlier in my life, I didn’t understand him — I was like, “Why is this guy building a bridge for the enemy? Why would a person get so obsessed with this just to try to keep order?” — I now understand it. It’s one of those movies that means a lot to me, because it was the first time that I think my father showed me that movies can actually speak to an ageless part of your soul. I remember the first time I saw Unforgiven, and I thought it was going to be like this big Western shoot-em-up, and I was like, “Man, I didn’t like that movie at all.” Then, I was at work the next day, and I thought, “I can’t stop thinking about that movie. Maybe I saw it wrong.” And now it’s one of the best movies ever. Bridge on the River Kwai was the first time I ever realized that.Purple Rain (1984, 73% Tomatometer)I would say my number one movie: Purple Rain. I could probably teach a semester of film studies on the first eight minutes of Purple Rain. And if you watch that first eight minutes, you’re going to see why, because the way the music — it’s like the extended version of “Let’s Go Crazy” — the way it’s cut, continuity completely goes out the window. You’ll be on stage with Prince, but then you’ll cut and you’ll see him getting ready to go on stage, then you’ll see him at his house, blowing out candles. Then you see him on his motorcycle coming to the club, cuts to him on stage in the club, cuts to Apollonia coming into town… By the end of that eight minutes, you know everybody’s character, you know their relationship to each other, and the music never stopped. It’s a dizzying… I think you see three tongues within the first eight minutes. You know, Apollonia’s boobs were like an atom bomb going off in my world, because up until that moment, I wanted to marry women, like, “I like that girl. I would want her to be my wife and have kids with her.” But then I saw Apollonia, and I was like, “I have thoughts now in my head that I didn’t have before, and feelings that I’ve never had before!” The same poster that I got at a fair in Vallejo, California of Apollonia in a bikini is up on my wall here in my office, and people still come in here and go, “Damn, I had that poster on my wall!”Next, Brewer talks at length about the why he chose to do Footloose, and why he made some of the changes in his version.Brewer filming on location for Hustle &amp; Flow&nbsp;RT: Let’s talk about Footloose.Craig Brewer: You know, I kept Footloose out. I kept it out, but I would put Footloose up in there. Really, Footloose is one of the most important movies of my life.No kidding. Alright, well, let’s get the basics out of the way: how did you come to work on the Footloose remake?I got a call. I got a call from Adam Goodman, head of the studio. [laughs] He was like, “You gotta do Footloose.” I had passed on it already, because — I’m sure, like a lot of fans of Footloose — how can you possibly dare to think that Footloose could be redone, and why would you want to do that? He said something to me that really clicked. He was like, “Well, listen, I think that you’re the person to do it. I think that the kinds of stories that you’ve been wanting to tell and the movies that you’ve already made actually are in the spirit of the original.” And they were very protective of the original; they weren’t in it just to make a money grab off of the title, because this is actually one of Paramount’s smaller movies. So they really wanted to do it for the heart, and they put that in my court to run with.I knew that if I figured out one thing, that it would all click into place, and that is the big MacGuffin, which is the whole, “How can you do a movie about a town banning dancing?” When I figured it out, I called up Adam, and I said, “Okay, here’s how the movie begins,” and I started telling him the movie, and within 10 minutes he’s like, “You did it. That’s how we’re going to do Footloose.”In the original movie, they don’t talk about why the town banned dancing until about an hour in. Up until that hour, we as an audience believe that it’s about Hell, like, they don’t want their kids dancing because they don’t want them to burn in the fiery pits of Hell, right? That’s kind of what you’re feeling. And then later you go, “Oh my god, there was this bad accident that killed the preacher’s son, the older brother of this girl that’s kind of suicidal, screwing around with guys she shouldn’t be screwing around on.” To me, that is more relevant than Heaven and Hell. To me, I feel we’re in a country right now that overreacts for the right reasons. We overreact in the wrong way for the right reason. We love and we care for our kids, we want the best for our fellow man, we don’t want harm to come to us. Therefore, the following laws need to be passed, so we don’t even have the risk of this happening, ever.I felt that if I could, at the beginning of the movie, give some context to this town, then the religious part of it would be taken out of it, and therefore I could focus on the religious elements in the movie that I think are better applicable to a modern South. I don’t like demonizing religion. I grew up with faith in my life, I grew up in church, and I’ve criticized it. I mean, you’ve seen my movies; it’s not necessarily like I’m a Christian poster child, but there’s Christian themes in all of my movies. I mean, Black Snake Moan, I got the idea for that from the book of Genesis, you know? And so, I wanted to make a movie where, to some degree, you understood where Reverend Moore was coming from. You know, I’m a father now, so I saw where he was coming from, and I knew that if I just, at the beginning of the movie, established that, where the one thing where people were like, “This just makes no sense. Why would you have a law banning dancing?” Well, let me tell you, when people watch the first five minutes of the movie, I think they get it, and they move past it, and they’re able to enjoy the movie and actually find that it’s relevant to this day.&nbsp;You know, before I saw your film, I actually did rewatch the original Footloose, and this was, in fact, one of the problems I had with the original. Watching yours, I was surprised by how much this change altered the tone of the movie as a whole, for me.Right, right. I’m glad you got to see them back-to-back, and I wish more people would treat this remake that way. I’m not here to replace that movie. I really want it to be a companion piece. That was the 1984 version of these things. You know, Dean Pitchford, who wrote the original, he’s co-screenwriter on this, because I really wanted a lot of the story to remain intact. I had great respect for the original Footloose; I’m not going to rethink it. I don’t want Ren going to bars, or Afghanistan to teach people how to dance; I want the same story. But it felt like in the South, now we get to deal with things that everybody at least thinks about with the South, this polarization, that they don’t want people coming in and telling them how to live their lives, you know, or changing what faith put in place, the whole red state/blue state thing. And now, I feel like our times are more polarizing than ever, because of those things. So I felt like, if I could just get on board with that element of it, then it was going to be a movie that doesn’t seem out of place next to Hustle &amp; Flow and Black Snake Moan.Yes, at first glance, people might look at you directing this film and think, “Wow, this is a huge departure for him after Hustle &amp; Flow and Black Snake Moan…?And what do you think, after having seen it?After having seen it, I don’t think that’s necessarily the case, because it’s got that musical element, it’s got the Southern setting, it’s got those themes of morality and redemption, which seem to exist in all of your films.I totally give that to the original, though. That’s what people don’t realize. If you want to understand where Hustle &amp; Flow and Black Snake Moan came from, I grew up with Footloose. I grew up with Flashdance. I grew up with Urban Cowboy. An Office and a Gentleman. These movies of the 1980s that were kind of “pop” movies, they had a hard edge to them. You know, Prince hauls off and smacks Apollonia after she gives him a white guitar. You know, Ariel takes a pipe to her boyfriend’s truck. These are some tough movies; they don’t make teenager movies like those any more. People are afraid. If Footloose, the original, came out today, I think it’d be rated R. It’s got kids smoking pot, it’s got underage sex, you got kids in bars drinking beer, and luckily, Paramount allowed me to keep all that. I was like, “Can I at least have it be as taboo as the original that plays on VH1? I mean, I’m not even going to do anything extra, but can I at least do what Footloose did?” Because that alone, people forget, was kind of hard. I think that they remember Footloose through watching music videos on VH1 “Remember the ’80s” or something like that, but I saw a movie that was kind of hard. Let me tell you, I remember the gasp in the theater when Lori Singer said, “I’m not even a virgin.” I remember it. People were like, “Ohh!” And now, they do the same thing this year. When I watch this version with a big crowd, an audience, “Ohh!” And it’s like, “Haven’t you guys seen Footloose? [laughs] Haven’t you seen Footloose? Don’t you know this moment happens?” They forget, like, “Oh my god, I can’t believe she said that.”&nbsp;Speaking of which, it struck me how similar your film is to the original in some respects, and yet how it manages to avoid feeling outdated. Was it you who was responsible for bringing on Dean Pitchford?Yes, yes. I had lunch with two people after I decided to do it, the first being Craig Zadan; he’s one of the producers on it, and he produced the original film. I said, “Listen, I know everybody’s wanting me to update and change it up and all this kind of bullsh**, but you need to know from me that’s not going to happen completely with me, because I love Footloose, and I think that there’s a way to show Footloose to a new audience — and to its old audience — to say, ‘There are certain things that you loved about it, and it’s not just Kenny Loggins singing that song. You loved Willard. You loved the friendship that was happening between these guys. We all want to feel like we could be chubby, or skinny dorks, and at the end of that movie, we’re dancing, and people are cheering and applauding and cracking up, because that’s what the spirit of Footloose was.'”And then I met with Dean. Dean read the script that I wrote — and I was very nervous about Dean reading it — and I said, “Dean, look, they tried to remake Footloose a couple of times, and the scripts that they made… No disrespect to them, but it was just a different direction than I wanted to go in.” You know, they were changing things about it, and I told him. I was like, “Listen, I took your original script, and I made my version of it, but it’s you and me, buddy, and if you don’t like this script, then we’re not going to make it.” But he was very emotional about it, in a very good way, and he said, “I see that you loved its heart.” And we just recently screened it for him, and it was probably one of the greatest nights of my life because — it’s weird — I met a man who was instrumental in my growth; he just didn’t know it. [laughs] So I had to tell him that; I was like, “Look, you need to know. I know you’re looking at Hustle &amp; Flow and Black Snake Moan, but Footloose made me who I am. This is my way of saying ‘thank you,’ and I hope that you approve,” and he loved the film. I think I made the right decision, just like I think J.J. Abrams, when he did Star Trek, he made the right decisions. We need to give places in this movie where people can feel like they’ve seen things from the past, of the movies that they love, but it’s in a new version that feels relevant and cool.Footloose (2011) opens on October 14.Read our 2007 interview with Craig Brewer about Black Snake Moan here.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"adventure, FX, remakes, Mindy, Polls, LGBT, spy, documentary, actors","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/3434.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-footloose-director-craig-brewer"},{"id":"47508849307978","title":"Five Favorite Films with Mario Van Peebles","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Mario Van PeeblesThe Redemption Road director also talks about movie music and his famous father.by Tim Ryan | September 2, 2011 |  CommentsNew Jack City, Mario Van Peebles‘s first directorial effort, was a critical and commercial smash, and he’s subsequently helmed and acted in a wide range of high-profile films and television shows. He made his big screen debut as a teenager in his father Melvin’s pioneering indie Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song; years later, the younger Van Peebles directed Baadasssss!, playing his father in a critically-acclaimed drama about the making of that seminal African-American film. His latest, Redemption Road, stars Michael Clark Duncan and Morgan Simpson in a drama about two unlikely road trip companions who find common ground in music. In an interview with RT, Van Peebles shared his favorite films, and also discussed using music as a character in his movies, working with his well-known father, and making the world a greener place..&nbsp;Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song (1971, 79% Tomatometer)Well, obviously, I would have to say my dad’s movie, Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song is one of them, for sure. You know, I was lucky in that case not only to see the film and see the first movie where an overtly empowered black power character goes up against the system and survives. That was the first of its kind. But also to see my father insist on working with a multiracial crew. He had women on it, he had hippies on it, Hispanics, Asians, you know, and really bring all these folks together. That was super inspiring, to see that you could take sort of a multiracial, sometimes ragtag crew and make the first overtly revolutionary film in America and win and change the game. Because after that, Shaft came. Shaft was written for a white detective by a guy named Ernest Tidyman, and when my dad’s film Sweetback made money, they rewrote it with a black guy, and they got a young guy to do the music from Stax Records named Isaac Hayes. My dad, when he did Sweetback, had used Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. So that was a super influential movie on me.Easy Rider (1969, 87% Tomatometer)Easy Rider was one I remember that just seemed to be the Peace and Freedom Party movement, in a way, reflected on screen. [Editor’s note: the Peace and Freedom Party was an organization founded in California in 1967 with the goal of ending the Vietnam War.]Black Orpheus (1959,90% Tomatometer)Black Orpheus was another film that I remembered as a kid. I just thought the way it was shot, in Brazil… I was drawn to the whole thing.Mutiny on the Bounty (1962, 69% Tomatometer)Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon Brando. After that I was like, “Man, I’m going to Hawaii or Tahiti and getting me one of them!” I mean, holy moly! [laughs] Just being out in nature like that and getting away from the hard, structured Victorian England, it’s almost like — if you look at it now — it’s like a guy going organic. [laughs] In multiple ways, I thought that was exciting.Night of the Living Dead (1968, 96% Tomatometer)Night of the Living Dead was one I saw with my dad. I was 18 years old. It scared the s— out of me. I think my dad and I had to sleep together that night. [laughs] I said, “No, that’s it. I don’t care how big I am!” And what I loved about it, too, was how [George] Romero could just take this film, and do it clearly on a budget, and yet make it work, have this sort of tongue-in-cheek humor with it.So part of what, I think, attracted me to the films I mentioned was not just the films themselves, but how they were made, what they meant politically, on all levels. I’m attracted to all those films that, in a way, engaged us across cultures. So, you look at Night of the Living Dead and you put these people in the 1960s in this pressure cooker, and one of them is the black guy, one of them is the white guy, one of them is the chick, and the brother and sister, and you see what happens. The unspoken subtext of it was huge. It was huge, it was revolutionary.Mutiny on the Bounty was the same thing. And even in films like Redemption Road, where I’ll take the black guy, and he’s the one who’s into country and western, and the white guy, he’s the one who’s into blues, and both of them, along the way, are going to encounter music that informs their personal narrative, and it also informs the musicality of the film. So, along the way they pick up some blues, some gospel, some jazz, and that feeds into the song they play at the end of the movie, the sort of redemptive song. So I think those movies actually speak to what I’m attracted to in film. I just like something that, on some level, even if it’s a horror film, is interesting and redemptive and makes you think.Next, Mario Van Peebles talks about using music as a character in film, and working with his famous father.What’s interesting about Redemption Road is how the music, as with some of your other films, is almost like a character. There scene early in New Jack City when Nino, played by Wesley Snipes, walks into a club and they’re playing “The Show” by Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh, and instantly you have the milieu, the vibe of the time.Mario Van Peebles Yeah, that’s a trip, and you’re right; the music here was almost a third character. And what I wanted in Redemption Road was to look at music in almost a historical perspective and say, “Okay, what’s interesting about America? Well, you take Jews, and Chinese, and Irish, and Russians, and Germans, and Africans, and you take the drums away from the Africans so they can’t put rhythm in the drums, but they can now put rhythm in the guitar and the piano. You put all these different cultures together in this new melting called the New World, called America, and you get sparks. And out of those sparks comes great art and great music, and that’s why so much music has come from America. And it’s got a rhythm to it; it’s almost like an African rhythm if you track it. And so, jazz, gospel, hip hop, rock and roll, rap, all this music comes out of America. In this trip through the heartland, you pick up bits of gospel, bits of country, and bits of blues, and that’s all a part of America’s birthright. So grounding it in Americana is almost like a ballad that’s been sung before. You almost feel like, “I’ve heard this ballad before.” But in fact it’s a new ballad, but it’s grounded contextually in something that’s very much a part of our culture, even down to the way the characters look, sort of [like] cinematic icons. Luke Perry’s going to be this sort of James Dean bad boy, and Taryn [Manning] is going to be this sort of Bettie Page thing, and the blues guy is going to be this guy, and the Marlboro Man, the country guy… So you’re not only hearing it, but you’re actually seeing it. And the cars they drive, you’re going to see we’re playing with primary colors, so Augy’s truck is blue, and her truck is yellow, and the mom’s car is red, so those are all primaries. And we put it all in a specific timeless space where this film could have been shot 10 years from now or 10 years ago, sort of disembodied from any time constraints. And the music, I mean, we had these guys from Nashville, and bring these guys up from New Orleans that to do the blues thing. So you’re really getting these great musicians to participate and then write the songs. A couple of songs I put together. You know, I’ve been doing music for a long time, years and years — my first piece of music for Clint Eastwood on Heartbreak Ridge — but get together with Tree [Adams], who wrote some of these songs and wad inspired by certain things and then took other artists, so that they would grow, so by the time [Jefferson] Bailey [played by Morgan Simpson] plays his requiem at the end, it encompasses country and blues and gospel and all those influences that feature in the narrative.&nbsp;Van Peebles with Redemption Road star Morgan SimpsonI was thinking about what you said about Redemption Road being timeless. A lot of your films are set in specific times and places, in the Old West, or the revolutionary 1960s, or contemporary New York City. When I was watching this film, I said to myself, “The main character doesn’t seem to have a cell phone; he’s using all these pay phones.” Were you trying to make this movie feel like it stood outside of a particular era?Yeah, you know, that’s a really good point. I think, more than any other genre of film, the Americans made Westerns. That was a real American genre. I did Posse. And of course, the gangster movie is nothing but an urban Western, and we did a lot of gangster movies as well. I wanted this to be timeless. Even looking at the locations, they were sort of almost Americana, Norman Rockwellian, you know what I mean? Between Norman Rockwell and Edward Hopper, so that it would go from Rockwell — this sort of bright, sunny, very clean Americana — to a little bit more edge, a little darker, Edward Hopper stuff, and strike that tonally. What I talked about with the DP [Matthew Irving] was, let’s start it out and play with these palettes. And he really got that, he really understood that.And then, playing with country and blues and all those… In this one, Tree and I wanted to work together — Tree is my composer — a director-composer collaboration, and I really feel that was a great collaboration, but that the director of photography was so much a part of that, too. The whole thing was a real collaboration, and that was really attractive about it. You know, this is not a studio film in that it’s not one of those pictures where you can have a lot of, you know, voting by committee. We still need things that were specific that we had to design — and we did — that I feel pretty strongly about the way they came out. Generally, it’s a pretty well-crafted little movie.Your father Melvin Van Peebles is in all your movies, and you guys obviously have a very close relationship, but was it still a little bit weird drudging up some of the family history when you were making Baadasssss!? When I saw it, I wondered, “Is this the most Freudian movie I’ve ever seen?”You know what? There are multiple ways and lenses I can look at something, and I decided, if I was going to tell that story, I was going to tell the truth. And my dad’s okay with that. You know, I wouldn’t have done that without his blessing. He knows he’s a good guy, and I’ve always jokingly called him a paternal fascist [laughs]. But he’s a bad dude, to do what he did and have all kinds of folks and break the unions and have multiracial crew. At that time, to do what he did — that was a bad muthah. There was no two ways about it.Now, there are things he did as a parent that I wouldn’t do, but I’m sure there are things that I’m doing as a parent that my kids wouldn’t do. Hopefully, we’ll all learn. We’ll have our moments where we can disagree, and hopefully and not be too disagreeable. But I was cool with it. The truth is what it is. We’re like, “We love each other, we’re not perfect…” A buddy of mine said to me once, “The biggest thing you can do with your kids is be who you say you are. And if you’re not who you say you are, then you’re going to spend a lot of time proving that you’re not who you say you are.” My dad was very clear with that. He said, “I never said I’m 100 percent perfect.” You know, so once you’re okay with that, once you’re okay with yourself, you’re like, “Hey, I’m looking in the mirror. I’m okay, what the hell?” That’s the most important thing, and here’s why: At a certain point, if you’re okay with you, then you’re family’s okay with you, then whether you’re on a billboard because Hollywood and the public loves you, or then you’re on a milk carton because Hollywood and the public no longer know who or where you are, you can be cool with it because you know your family loves you, you’re cool with you, and the folks around you know how you are, and you’re not measuring yourself by that kind of thing. So once you’re insulated from that, then you get the joke of life, and my dad gets the joke of life. I like to think I get the joke of life. We’re not perfect.You know, there’s four phases in your life; there’s “Mario who?”, “Get me Mario,” “Get me young Mario,” and “Mario who?” So while you’re in the “Get me Mario” phase, do some movies that have some quality, that make people think, that inspire. Not everybody’s going to like it, but do something. Don’t just do, you know, Dumb and Dumber, Part Seven. You know what I mean? You don’t know which movie is going to be your last movie, so treat them all like they’re important. Once you start to do that, then you’re cool.The other thing is this: Not only am I not that worried about what the public thinks all the time — of course, I’m going to worry about it to some degree – but because none of my family is really materialistic, it doesn’t affect us the same way. If I had to have five Rolls-Royces and two big houses — and my dad had to have that — to feel good, then we’re more reliant on the system supporting this. But we’re like, “Dude, I’m not a materialistic guy anyway, and neither is my dad, and we never were.” So a lot of what most folks subscribe to, we don’t subscribe to, and yet we’re very rich. We’re not rich because we have a lot of money; we’re rich because we get to do what we want to do. So, part of being rich is being able to say “I don’t give a f—.” [laughs]. You can’t take money from McDonald’s and then make Super Size Me. So the minute that all the money to make my movies come from the system, comes from the bank, then my money’s no longer independent, and my vision can’t be independent. If my vision’s independent, my money has to be independent. My independent vision is not trying to please the dominant culture or the bank. That’s a big difference. That’s why I don’t have to put on a wig and put on a dress and act like a buffoon.Melvin and Mario Van PeeblesYou’ve been directing a lot of stuff for television lately. When you’re working on LOST or Damages and you’re only directing a few episodes here and there, do you find that confining, or do you feel you can put your stamp on something that’s already established?Yeah, that’s a good question. I have to say, I just finished doing Boss, which is a new show with Kelsey Grammar, where he plays this sort of politically entrenched powerhouse mayor of Chicago, and I think he’s going to light it up; he is great in this thing. Gus Van Sant directed the first one. The thing is, when you do LOST or Damages, Sons of Anarchy, and even Law &amp; Order, but you do those thinking shows. I have to say that some of these are better written than some of these superhero, silly things that are out there posing as films right now. You know, they’re really video games in 3D. And the other thing is, as a director, it really keeps you at fighting weight, so when I go out and I’m going to do Damages or LOST or Boss, and you’ve gotta do that in eight days, and you stay sharp with it, you’re working with some really good actors — I was working with Kelsey, of course, and William Hurt — you’re working with some powerhouse folks that are fine actors, it’s really exciting. Do you have to know how to move, know how to think, know how to make your day? Yeah. But what I do with each one is I push the envelope, and I learn on each show. I learned something on LOST that I had never done before, and I just did something with Kelsey on Boss that I had not done before. So I think if I had gotten complacent and sat back and said, “Well, I’m just going to phone it in,” that’s why I left being a budget analyst for [New York City] Mayor [Ed] Koch, because I didn’t want to phone it in. So yeah, it depends on the kind of filmmaker you are, but I definitely enjoy it and would go back in between features to do that. So I definitely enjoy it. But look, they are getting to do on cable TV what we used to only be able to do in indie film. And now, they’re doing some things on cable that you go, “Wow, that’s pretty interesting stuff.”&nbsp;In addition to working for Mayor Koch, you also worked for the Environmental Protection Agency before you made your bones in Hollywood, and recently you had the show Mario’s Greenhouse, where you and your family tried to live as green as possible. How do you feel about the state of the environmental debate?Well, the environmental debate is stalled behind the economic debate, if you will. I’m an Econ major. But we made a mistake in Economics. The mistake we made in Economics was… How much does it cost us to go to the forest, cut down a tree, make the tree into a chair, bring it to market, varnish it up, and take out some ads and sell it? The supply and demand will determine the cost of the chair. But that’s a fundamental mistake. The fundamental mistake is that we’re only thinking about its effects on humans, and even that is shortsighted. We never think, you know, the tree was giving us oxygen. We never thought the tree might have a medicinal purpose. We never took into account that the tree was giving us shade, or keeping the topsoil together. We never took into account that it was providing a habitat for other forms of life besides human beings. So the numbers were off. We never accounted for it.If we wipe out all the forests, what will it cost us to create oxygen? Now, that’s going to be a whole different cost. So economics is lost, and the ever growing idea that this economy can always keep growing into perpetuity with the population going into perpetuity, with a world that’s finite and resources that are finite, it’s always going to be off. Now, what’s interesting — I was just talking to my kids about it — with the economy on a downturn, guess what’s happening ecologically? No downturn! Because we’re driving less, we’re flying less, we’re having less kids, so sometimes it’s absolutely the inverse of what’s happening with this sort of artificial economy thing that we’ve all created. Look at it this way: if you invest in pharmaceutical, your stocks go up when people are sick and buying a lot of pharmaceuticals, but if people get healthy, your pharmaceutical stocks are going to drop. So what’s healthy for the market is not necessarily healthy or human beings or for the planet. All ecological discussion is second place to the economic one, and of course, in this time when the Tea Party is holding everyone hostage, and our government, unfortunately, the way it’s structured right now, is not really democracy, because the people that aren’t afraid to bring the temple down filibuster and obstruct the whole damn thing. So it’s very difficult and to put forth and to pass anything ecological-saving, because human beings always ask “What does it mean to me and my job?” As the Native Americans said, we don’t inherit the land from our parents, we borrow it from our children. Until we get that philosophy down, I don’t know that we’ll make any real change. That’s my position. That doesn’t mean I won’t do everything I can in my power with my films, with my media, to try to get people to think. It doesn’t mean I won’t fight the good fight, but I think we’re in a tough place. I think tomorrow’s generation… I have good reason to fight for it, because I’ve got five kids. Tomorrow’s generation is going to be in a different place than us. [Environmental activist] Paul Watson said, “We are on a wonderful spaceship blowing through space. The spaceship’s called Earth, and it’s really more ocean than earth, and we’re killing off the crew.” All the life support systems, the worms, the birds, all the stuff we don’t care about, and we’re killing off the crew. And we say, “Hey man, I don’t understand why this is happening to us.” That’s because we’re not looking at the cause and effect of how we live. You know, I don’t want to get on my soapbox too much about it, but I think we’re going to be in tough shape, and the question is, will we wake up in time, and how many of these other species will we take with us? The planet ultimately will survive – it’s not the death of the planet – but will our species survive? That’s the question. It’s got nothing to do with party, race, sex, sexual preference. Dr. King used to say, “We have to learn to live in harmony with each other or die together as fools;” I would add to that, “We have to learn to live in harmony with each other and nature or perish together as fools.” So there you have it!

But his success didn’t come without hard work; the young actor has remained busy since his fist stint on the ABC soap One Life to Live almost nineteen years ago, moving from popular teen fare like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Cruel Intentions to critical darlings like Gosford Park and Oscar winner Crash. This week, Phillippe takes on a nuanced dramatic role as Louis Roulet, a successful LA realtor accused of a mysterious murder, in the film adaptation of Michael Connelly’s novel The Lincoln Lawyer. RT was fortunate enough to chat with Phillippe about his Five Favorite Films, as well as his fortuitous introduction to the film industry and what it was like to work with legendary directors like Clint Eastwood and Robert Altman.&nbsp;Cool Hand Luke (1967, 100% Tomatometer)&nbsp;The film that sort of made me want to be an actor was Cool Hand Luke. I watched it one Sunday when I skipped church, and I was home sick, and it was on TBS, and I was about 12 or 13 years old. I had never seen a man cry like that. [SPOILER AHEAD] When Paul Newman finds out his mother’s died and he sits on the bed and plays “Plastic Jesus” on the banjo [END SPOILER], I was so fascinated by this masculine tough guy getting emotional, and that sort of started my interest in acting. Figuring out how one gets to that place, and why. And both he and Steve McQueen were the two people I first connected to or looked up to as actors.The Sand Pebbles (1966, 88% Tomatometer)&nbsp;The Sand Pebbles with McQueen is one of those films that shows more of his sensitivity. People tend to think of him as just the badass, and I love the fact that that film lets you see another side of him. And I also think it’s beautifully shot. So that’s another one on my list.The Graduate (1967, 89% Tomatometer)&nbsp;The remaining three are films that I just feel are nearly perfect. The Graduate, from top to bottom, visually, sonically, performance-wise, the energy, and the time when it came out, and what it represented – that whole Holden Caufield sort of aspect to it. I think the music, obviously; there are very few films where the music has been so married to the actual film itself, and I love that about The Graduate. It seems like that’s the way it always should have been. It’s just amazing to me how perfectly it complements the film.Fargo (1996, 94% Tomatometer)&nbsp;I have to go with a Coen brothers movie, because they are my inspiration as producers, filmmakers — I want to direct soon. Again, I think that Fargo is a nearly perfect film. Visually, comedically; it manages to be tense, and it’s smart. I love the fact that it’s based on somewhat of a true story — I think that’s kind of where my interests lie, the idea of doing a true crime story that’s darkly comedic; that’s something that really appeals to me. I could name several of their films, but Fargo is the one that just… I always think about that shot in the parking lot in the snow, when he’s just trying to scrape the window off and he just loses his mind. [laughs]Raging Bull (1980, 98% Tomatometer)&nbsp;And then one of the most inspirational films for an actor would, in my opinion, have to be Raging Bull. Just to see what De Niro went through physically, the span of time he takes that character through, the insecurity and the bravado and the anger. I think it’s still a performance that’s relatively unmatched in film history.&nbsp;Next, Phillippe talks about how he got into acting, and what it was like working with some of cinema’s greatest modern directors.RT: You mentioned when you saw Cool Hand Luke that you were pretty young, and you said it was the first movie that really inspired you. Were you then confident that you would become an actor someday?Ryan Phillippe: No, definitely not. I didn’t grow up with any means or access to the business in any way, so it was what my mother would have referred to as a “pipe dream” at that time. [laughs] Also, the schools I went to had no drama programs; it was nothing I had any experience with. When I was younger, I used to make home movies on the video camera with my sisters, and I would really direct them, and I would have plots, and I would write the story. But I had no experience in acting, in any formal sense, when I saw that movie.So when was it that you finally took that first step towards becoming an actor?It was about two or three years after that, and I didn’t even really take the step. Someone saw me getting a haircut, oddly enough, and recommended us to an agency in Philadelphia. It’s one of those; that’s how it happened. So I started going to Philadelphia for essentially what would have been commercials or modeling jobs, and met people through that.Let’s talk about The Lincoln Lawyer…Dude, it’s really good. [Matthew McConaughey] is going to win back a bunch of people with this. It’s his best performance ever. It’s better than A Time to Kill. It’s legit, man.[rtimage]siteImageId=10241512[/rtimage]It’s funny that you mention A Time to Kill, because that’s inevitably sort of the first movie that comes to mind with The Lincoln Lawyer. You’ve got McConaughey as sort of a hotshot attorney, and you’ve got themes dealing with the nature of a suspect’s culpability…The difference is, this character of his is so flawed in Lincoln Lawyer. You know, he’s got a drinking problem, he’s divorced, he’s got a kid, he’s kind of an ambulance chaser; it’s a very textured part for him.Your role in the film is textured as well. It’s one of those roles where the audience is left guessing, “Is he guilty, or is he not?” When you’re playing a part like that, is there any sort of extra preparation needed to pull off that sort of subtlety?It definitely has initially that sort of Primal Fear dynamic, and you’re trying to figure out who this guy is. What’s a benefit always is the source material, having a full novel to read. You can glean even more and add to your design of the character through things written by the author of the novel that the audience doesn’t even know about. That allows you to add layers and subtext that fit into an adaptation of a novel. There’s so much more, obviously, in the book. So it’s fun, as an actor, to have those little secrets, and hopefully people go and read the book — it’s really enjoyable — but yeah, that was the primary preparation for me. It was kind of getting into all the details that lie within the book, and finding a way to fit that in the moments in the movie, even though it’s truncated or compressed.Were there any other films or performances you drew upon to flesh out your character?No, and I rarely do that. I play a Beverly Hills real estate agent in this movie, and I did spend a day or two shadowing this guy who essentially does the same thing my character does in LA. But I never watch other performances in regards to what I’m going to do. A lot of it is instinct, and a lot of it is trying to make the part or the person that you’re playing as complex and interesting as you can, and I think that needs to be original to some extent.[rtimage]siteImageId=10241513[/rtimage]You mentioned that you’d like to take up directing at some point in the future, and you’ve worked with some heavy hitters yourself, from Clint Eastwood to Robert Altman to Ridley Scott. What did you take away from working with those filmmakers that you think you’ll apply to your own directorial efforts?Well, you know, I feel like I’ve gone to the best film school in the world. Ridley Scott, Kim Peirce, the ones you mentioned, and I took time from an early age… My first real role was in a Ridley Scott movie, and I knew who he was as a filmmaker, I’d seen all of his films, and so from that first job, I really paid attention to every aspect of it. I spent time talking to the DPs on those films, and I got to sit in dailies next to Altman; he actually kind of forced me to. [laughs] During lunch, he shows his dailies, and he’d be like, “I want you to sit here,” and I’d get to hear what it was he did or didn’t like about each and every individual take, and why. It was amazing. And then, working with someone like Eastwood, who’s so efficient and so confident in what he’s doing that there’s no stress, there’s no fuss. I plan on incorporating elements of each of those directors I’ve worked with when I make a film. I feel really fortunate. It’s also why I feel ready to do it; I’ve made 25 films, I’ve been doing this for 19 years, pretty much, 18 years. So I feel ready.Wow, has it really been that long?Well, my first movie, I was 19. I’m 36 now, so… And I was on a soap at 17. That’s the thing, you know. As an actor, you can have almost two decades in the profession and still be relatively young. It’s a funny thing.The Lincoln Lawyer opens this weekend in the US.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"documentaries, cops, Sundance, nature, york","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/vxzc.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-ryan-phillippe"},{"id":"47508851069274","title":"Five Favorite Films with Michelle Monaghan","content":"\n\n                                            Five Favorite Films\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Five Favorite Films with Michelle Monaghan\n                        The star of Duncan Jones' sci-fi thriller Source Code drops by for a chat about her most-loved movies.\n                        by Luke Goodsell | March 31, 2011                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nIn director Duncan Jones’ ( Moon) new time-twisting sci-fi thriller  Source Code, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a soldier sent into a space of eight minutes aboard a train bound for disaster; a temporal pocket he must inhabit over and over until he unravels either the identity of a bomber — or his own. Fortunately he gets to relive those same eight minutes with his delightful co-star Michelle Monaghan, who plays a passenger on the train in possession of a possible key to Jake’s future. Or past. No, wait, is it the future? Yep, it’s one of those cyclical narratives that revels in its sometimes confounding paradoxes. For Monaghan, who Jones cast having liked her in  Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, it meant playing the same scene, and character, on endless loop; adjusting her performance ever so slightly in reaction to the changing trajectory of Gyllenhaal’s time-tripper. We caught up with the actress, most recently seen in  Due Date and  Somewhere and soon to star in Marc Forster’s  Machine Gun Preacher, and asked her to name her Five Favorite Films. “That’s really hard,” Monaghan laughs, “but I’m sure everybody tells you how hard it is.” Indeed.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nA Woman Under the Influence (1974, 94% Tomatometer)\n\n\n\nMy favorite — my number one favorite, actually — is A Woman Under the Influence. [Gena Rowlands] is just… I respect and admire her so much as an actress. I just think that performance is so brave and extraordinary. It was one of those things that, as a woman, as an actress, I kind of appreciate, you know. And also, that film is kind of a really, truly independent film. I think Cassavetes financed it, I think Peter Falk put money into it; kind of no one really believed in it. I was in a film a couple of years ago that a studio would never touch, a movie called Trucker, which was a great opportunity for me; but those sort of movies need to be independently financed.\n\n\n Fargo (1996, 94% Tomatometer)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI really like Fargo a lot. It has everything. I love the Coen brothers. I love Frances McDormand, I think she’s just an extraordinary actress. She’s so funny in that movie, as Marge. I’m from the Midwest, I’m from Iowa; so obviously that accent’s really heightened, but it’s something that I hear every time I go home. It’s something that feels like very much where I grew up; that backdrop is exactly where I grew up. It’s definitely exaggerated but yeah, there’s definitely that, “Oh, oh my gosh” where I come from. And when I go home and after I have a couple of beers you’d probably hear it come out: “You betcha!” [laughs]\n\n\nNational Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation (1989, 62% Tomatometer)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI love Christmas Vacation, with Chevy Chase, and Randy Quaid as well. It’s so funny. Juliette Lewis is in there, too — who I think is genius, by the way, in everything that she’s in. That movie, to me, is so funny that every time it plays at Christmas time I inevitably have to watch it. I mean, every scene in that movie is so funny — when that squirrel lands on the toupee of the grandpa; the kid when he gets on the damn saucer and he flies down the hill, I mean, I just think that’s a really cheesy scene. And I love Chevy Chase. Any Chevy Chase. He’s just got a really funny quality about him, and it’s really subtle — he’s got a little twinkle in his eye, he’s really sort of mischievous. I like him. Just the way he carries himself — he’s really animated without being physical.\n\n\n","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"black, Exclusive, Travel, Comic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/sfda.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-michelle-monaghan"},{"id":"47508854461812","title":"Five Favorite Films with Saw‘s Tobin Bell","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Saw's Tobin BellFive Favorite Films, Mr. Bell. Make your choice.by Alex Vo | October 29, 2010 |  CommentsAs the mastermind behind an seemingly endless stream of traps and torture devices known as Jigsaw, Tobin Bell has cemented his legacy as the new milennium’s first standout horror icon. Bell’s yearly participation as pharisaical serial killer John Kramer (aka Jigsaw) comes to an end with Saw 3D, the final installment of the Saw series and thus reaching a conclusion seven years in the making. We subject Bell to a battery of questions to uncover his Five Favorite Films.Rudy (1994, 79% Tomatometer)Let’s start with Rudy. It’s a football film. It?s about a kid who wants to go to Notre Dame, and he overcomes all obstacles to make that happen. You know, he wants to go to Notre Dame, he wants to play on the Notre Dame football team, but he hasn’t got the beef. He overcomes all obstacles and endures, achieves his dream.It’s just really well crafted. I do like films that make you feel something for the characters, and that’s unquestionably one. Sean Astin does an amazing job playing Rudy, and there’s some other great actors in it, too. So I have appreciated that film and watched it on a number of occasions.Jeremiah Johnson (1972, 93% Tomatometer)There is a film called Jeremiah Johnson that was directed by Sydney Pollack with Robert Redford. It’s about 1830s mountain men, and I’ve always been fascinated by those guys who, in the 1830s, when the West was still totally wild ? there were no homesteaders, no settlers ? guys who would go out there and live in the mountains amidst the Indians and carve out a living, catching beaver and muskrat and whatever else they were catching, skinning them and bringing the hides back, so they could be turned into hats for fashionable people in London. There’s some really great music in it. I loved the nature and the Rocky Mountains; I think it actually was shot in the early days of the Sundance institute out in the Salt Lake area, although the story has it happening in the Rocky Mountains, probably a little east of there. Montana, Wyoming, that area. So, love that film.The Firm (1993,76% Tomatometer)The Firm, which was a film that I got a chance to be in, and got a chance to work with Sydney [Pollack] and really rub shoulders with Gene Hackman for the first time. Well, actually, I had been with Gene in Mississippi Burning. But I got to work with Gene Hackman and Tom Cruise and Holly Hunter and Gary Busey and Wilford Brimley. But Sydney Pollack had a great career as a director and I always admired his approach to things. Jeanne Tripplehorn was in The Firm also, did a great job as Tom’s wife. I love the music in The Firm. Dave Grusin wrote the music. I thought the film was very well put together, and when you take a novel, sometimes the film doesn’t match up, and I thought The Firm did match up.I read the novel and was very impressed with the scary Nordic guy who was sort of shadowing Tom Cruise’s character throughout the novel. He was just scary. And then, I’d say it was a year or two years later that my agents got a call from Pollack. I think he knew my work from the Actor’s Studio in New York, because Sydney was always very involved with the studio, and I think he was also a fan of Mississippi Burning and had seen that film. That took its own wings, and he just offered the role of the Nordic, and I thought, “Wow, that’d be great.” So I got to go to Memphis, Tennessee, the home of rock ‘n’ roll.The Devil Wears Prada (2006,75% Tomatometer)How about a comedy? The Devil Wears Prada. I love that film. I love Meryl Streep, along with the rest of the world. She’s the bad guy in this film, so to watch Meryl play a bad guy with all of the layering and the subtlety, still you love her in the end. It’s just wonderful. I love the couple of speeches in there ? Stanley Tucci has a couple of speeches in there, one of which is to Anne Hathaway. Anne comes in to him and tells him, couldn’t she be given credit for trying? And he goes off on her about the value of trying and whether, in fact, she does deserve credit for trying. Great, great speech. Then the other speech I love is the one about the blue sweater, where Anne Hathaway thinks she’s underplaying her fashion sense by wearing sort of nondescript, underplayed, like she?s not going to be one of these fashionistas, and Meryl Streep goes off on her about how many hours were put in by designers crafting the kind of underplayed, nondescript look that often people are… they try to represent themselves by looking like they don’t care about how they look, and they just kind of throw something together. She goes off about this blue sweater that Anne Hathaway’s wearing, and I just thought that was brilliant, and in the mouth of Meryl Streep, it was even more on the mark.The Descent (2005,84% Tomatometer)Let’s do horror. I would say The Descent, which was a film that was, I don’t know, maybe a few years old now. What I like about the first 45 minutes of the film is they develop the characters and the relationships between these women who are going to descend into this cave in the latter part of the film, and that’s where the horror and the mayhem starts to happen. But they give the time to draw you into the lives of these women, and so as a result, you care about them by the end of the film. I thought that was an accomplishment for a horror film. It also has one of the scariest scenes I’ve seen in a long time. They have these monsters down in the cave that are done with special effects ? green screen or however the hell they do it, CGI ? but there’s a scene where one of the girls, who now you care about, crawls through a tunnel and gets trapped in this space that’s too small, and she can’t move forward and she can’t move back. Talk about simple, but horrifying if you’re claustrophobic in any way. Really, really well shot and really well played.Saw 3D opens this weekend, so make sure to check back on RT for reviews.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"ABC, Best, laika","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sfd.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-saws-tobin-bell"},{"id":"47508854458738","title":"Five Favorite Films with Terry Crews","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Terry CrewsThe Expendables star chats about working with Stallone and becoming an action star.by Ryan Fujitani | November 23, 2010 |  CommentsTerry Crews may not yet be a household name, but chances are that most people will probably recognize his face. Whether it was the role of Chris Rock’s father on the television sitcom Everybody Hates Chris, the family patriarch on TBS’s Are We There Yet?, President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho in Idiocracy, or the pec-flexing, tiger-riding Old Spice spokesman in a series of recent Tim and Eric-directed commercials, Crews has steadily kept busy since 2000, when he made his big screen debut alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in The 6th Day. A former NFL player who majored in Art in college, Crews has built a reputation for himself as the musclebound hulk with impeccable comic timing, often stealing scenes in movies with bigger names. But Terry’s star is rising, and earlier this year, Sylvester Stallone saw fit to cast him in his new actioner, The Expendables, which comes out on home video this week.RT was lucky enough to get the chance to chat with Terry, and what we quickly discovered was that he is a huge (literally and figuratively) movie lover, and like any movie lover, he found his favorites hard to pin down: “I just love movies so much, and I have so many reasons that I love certain things. It runs the whole gamut, but I’m going to give it a shot. I’m always going to feel like I left something out.” He was so excited to talk about his Five Favorites, in fact, that he actually gave us six, as well as an Honorable Mention, and continued to geek out well into the second half of the interview. Since we aren’t ones to argue with President Camacho, here are all seven of Terry Crews’s Five Favorite Films!Do the Right Thing (1989, 96% Tomatometer)First one on my list is Do the Right Thing. Spike Lee, man. I actually saw that twenty times in the theaters. That’s before VCRs; I mean, that was like right when the VCRs were kind of happening, and you had to wait a year for something to come out on VHS. It wasn’t the quick turnaround like we have right now. But Do the Right Thing changed my life in so many ways, because I had never seen… it was a movie that was comedic, yet so powerful. I didn’t really have a definition, because I’d never seen black people on screen like that, and it was just one of those things. It was my era; it was my generation. There was a lot of blaxploitation before that, you know, and you could see people on TV, and all this stuff.But I remember I was in college, and it was kind of like this empowerment. Spike had made She’s Gotta Have It, but then Do the Right Thing really broke it down. It changed my life. It made me want to get into the business like never before. Totally. I was like, I am a Spike Lee nut; I want to do this. I thought it should have won Best Picture that year; it just meant so much. It just meant a lot to everybody. There was a lot of race relations stuff, and just think of the stars that came out of that: Sam Jackson, Martin Lawrence, and Spike himself, and Rosie Perez, and John Turturro. I mean, it’s just… Whew! It just changed the game, changed the game.Aliens (1986, 100% Tomatometer)And then I’ll go to my next one. Aliens. Jim Cameron, Sigourney Weaver. Dude, again, I am a “big movie” guy. I like the small, poignant indie, but you know, give me a Summer flick all day long. That’s what I grew up on, that’s my era. I mean, I remember seeing Star Wars at the drive-in; I’m that guy. But Aliens really upped the game for what the horror genre could be, you know what I mean? Because it was this weird mix of action and horror. You know, the first one was like straight horror, like oh my god, the creepiness, the ickiness of this thing. But then in Aliens, you’re like, “Yo, they got Marines! It’s like that? This is nuts!” It just created this frenzy in me that was like, oh, this is how it’s supposed to be done. I’ll never forget it. Any time Aliens is playing, I can’t turn away. I cannot.Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (1977,94% Tomatometer)And then I’ll go to my third one, which of course I would say… Most people would go with The Empire Strikes Back, but I gotta go with Star Wars, the original. The Summer tentpole, it was something we had never seen before. I remember, back in the day it was all those exorcism movies, you know, it was the same time when all that was going on when they were like, “The Tempter!” and you turn around and it’s a scary movie. And then there was Taxi Driver, and all these weird… Everything had a weird aura to it, you know what I mean? And my mother was like, “I can’t take you to the movies! You’ll see something crazy!”So my aunt took me to see Star Wars. That was the only thing that we could see as kids. It was either that or The Apple Dumpling Gang, and I was like, “We can’t go that young!” [laughs] But Star Wars, man, I mean… It was really the sci-fi thing. Still to this day, I’m a sci-fi nut. I love it. It’s one of those things that influences me to this day.The Pianist (2002,95% Tomatometer)I want to go into another movie that I gotta bring up. The Pianist with Adrien Brody, Roman Polanski, the whole thing. Now, I don’t endorse his moral behaviors, but I have to say man, that movie… What he did with that character put me there, and I had never been there. Literally, I’m in the theater, and dude, I’m crying, I’m like, “Yo, this is crazy!” I go by emotional moments; if I walk out of the theater and I’m actually changed, you know what I mean? You know, you see the world in a different way. That’s the power of movies, to me. Like, when you go in and you saw the world one way, but when you walk out, I’m like, “I saw the world in a whole different way.” And Adrien Brody’s performance really taught me what an actor should do and should be. He gave everything he had. It was an awesome performance, an awesome movie, and I would just encourage everybody to see that one. That’s one of my favorite movies of all time. I bought that sucker; I got it on Blu-Ray, you know? [laughs]300 (2007,60% Tomatometer)Another one that I have to say – because I am an artist, I am a graphic designer and an art guy – is 300. That literally was a seismic shift in filmmaking for me, because Zack Snyder took this thing in such a creative direction. It was like, every frame, you could frame on your wall. You could literally take each piece of that movie, frame it, and it would stand as a piece of art, and that’s what I loved about that movie. Gerard [Butler] is my friend; we did Gamer together, and that’s all I could talk about on set. I was like his 300 groupie on that whole movie, you know? [laughs] But the power and the simplicity of what it was all about, too. Zack got to the archetype of what all the characters were; the story was simple, it was powerful.The Thing (1982,80% Tomatometer)The next one is The Thing, the remake with Keith David. That was the first Rated-R movie my mother ever let me see, and oh, dude, I was scarred. I was scarred in a good way. [laughs] John Carpenter’s The Thing took me to a whole other place, man. I was like, “Oh my god!” It was almost like losing your virginity. [laughs] Remember what I said about coming out of the theater a different way? The Thing was so violent and so creatively crazy, no one had ever seen anything like that on screen. You know, heads growing legs and walking away? I think Rob Bottin was the special effects guy on that. But, you know, heads ripping themselves off, dogs having three heads, it was just “Oh my god, there’s no stopping this!” One of my favorite movies; if it’s ever on, I can’t turn it off. I just can’t. It’s impossible.And the thing is, you see how most of the movies that I’m mentioning have always had copies, you know what I mean? It’s like, any movie that’s out there, you can see they’re trying to be like The Thing, or they’re trying to be like Aliens. It’s so wild how you see this kind of dynamic, because it changed for those filmmakers when they saw it too. So those are my top five for today. I tell you, that’s so hard to say. [laughs] Again, I love movies man. I just love it.Roger &amp; Me (1989,100% Tomatometer) – Honorable MentionOh! I’ve got an Honorable Mention; can I get an Honorable Mention? Roger &amp; Me, Michael Moore. I was born and raised in Flint, Michigan. For me, that changed the whole documentary game. Usually, docs were PBS specials or that sort of thing, but it was like, “Oh my god, this is actually entertaining!” [laughs] And Mike, you know, he made sure he crossed that line. I remember it was going up against Batman, so it was like Roger &amp; Me and Batman, and actually, Do the Right Thing was coming out right around that same time. It was a real watershed moment for me. But my Honorable Mention is Roger &amp; Me. What it did for the doc game, really made me respect the power of a great documentary. I could get the same great emotion from that as I did anything.Next, Terry talks about being a sci-fi nut and what it was like working under Sylvester Stallone.Rotten Tomatoes: You mentioned your art background, and you also mentioned how you’re a sci-fi guy. With that in mind, is that something you pay special attention to when you watch a movie? The special effects and costuming?Terry Crews: Always. To me, it’s one of those things where, if you don’t do it right, it’s painfully evident, you know what I mean? I’m not a big fan of… I’ll tell you when they got it wrong, was when they did the third Alien with the CGI aliens. It just crushed my heart, it crushed me. It took me away. You know, I was like, “Nooo.” When you can’t see a craftsman doing his thing… I remember looking at Rick Baker and the stuff he did; he worked on Norbit with us. I got a chance to meet him, and you could just kind of see it in his face, like, “Dude, they’re really messing it up, aren’t they?” He didn’t say it, he didn’t say it, but you could kind of see it. You know, he’s a real craftsman. It’s okay to put it in when you need it, but man, you really, really have to know your stuff. That’s why, again, I respect a Zack Snyder, a guy who can actually get the CGI right and mix it with the art and mix it with certain great things and make it what it is.I’m a fan of Blade Runner. You go back to Blade Runner and it still holds up to this day, whereas other movies… When you look at the first Tron right now, you will be like, “Whoa…” [laughs] You know what I mean? It makes you pause. I loved Tron when I was a kid, and now you’re like, “Whoa, why did I like that?” I’m really looking forward to Tron: Legacy, though. You can almost feel Disney’s like, “Now we get a chance to do it right.” Every artist in it is like, “Dude, we get a chance to remake Tron!” Because now it’s like, finally the effects caught up to what they had in their heads. I rented Tron for my kids, and I was like, “Uh-oh,” because they were milling around, saying, “I’m hungry.” They’re not into this like I was into this. [laughs]It’s like listening to old records as opposed to the new, mixed-down… You know, it’s iPod vs. a record player, man. And back then, you talk about editing, editing was so much slower. Things lasted forever! Go watch Wargames now. Watch Wargames and you will flip at how the camera never moves. The perfect example now is, you watch an old time trailer, you know, from an old movie back in the ’60s or ’70s, and you’re like, “I would never go see that!” [laughs] Once people started to get it, it’s like ever year, it gets better. They know what resonates with people. It just gets better and better and better. You can’t help it; you have to improve. It’s like the NFL; they’re faster, they’re stronger. What’re you gonna do?I want to talk to you a little bit about The Expendables. You were a teenager during the ’80s, so you grew up during sort of the golden age of action films, when Stallone and Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis were cranking out those classics. What kind of experience was it for you to actually share the screen with some of them?TC: Aw man, now I feel bad, because I should have put this movie on the list. But what can I say? If it was a top ten list, it would be here. Rocky III. Sly and Mr. T, you know? People don’t understand, Mr. T changed what villains are in the movies. No one had ever seen a real villain that ferocious. He had to be invented. He’s like, “Why don’t you get yourself a real man?” I remember being in the theater, a little theater, Northwest Theater in Flint, Michigan, sitting there watching Rocky III. And then to be there, looking Sly in the eyes on set, telling me where to go and what to do. It was very surreal, man. It was one of those things where I would freeze up like, “Uh-oh,” and I also realized if I don’t bring it, Sly isn’t going to be happy. [laughs] I also knew that I was brought there for a reason, and this was my chance, and this is what I gotta do, and Sly is depending on me. He took me under his wing and basically told me, “I’m going to make you an action star.” And I was so honored, man. It’s just one of those things that, you realize that you can’t even put it on a plaque and put it on a wall. You just have to keep it in your heart, because it’s yours. You know, it’s just yours, there’s nothing you can say to anybody that’ll say, “Oh look, this is the moment.” I keep it right in here, man, and I’m like, “Dude, Sly is my boy.” You know what I mean? Just saying he’s a friend… I mean, he’s one of the greatest filmmakers who ever did it. What can I say? I’m floored.I know that there were a few people ahead of you in the casting process, but as far as I know, nobody I’ve spoken to and nothing I’ve read has disagreed with the decision to cast you in the role. What’s it feel like to know you’re sort of acknowledged alongside these legends, and people are saying, “Yeah, we like him for this, he belongs in this movie?”TC: Well you know, the thing is, Sly saw it. Sly saw it, and he gave it to me. But this is another thing; I was really, really nervous, because some people were like, “What is he doing in that? He’s a comedian, he’s funny, etc.” And then, to come out, and everybody’s like, “Dude, there’s no question.” What can I say? It’s like going into a [football] game and getting four sacks, you know? It’s like, “Why did he get drafted first round? Where did he come from? He went to a small school, Allegheny in Pennsylvania,” or something. And then you go get four sacks, and everybody’s like, “Got it! We understand now.” Sly gave me the… You know, I did the whole cavalry thing [ed. note: referring to a scene in The Expendables]; he made sure he established me as that. He saw it in me before anybody saw it. And I’m thankful. I can’t wait to do the second one. I am ready, in shape, and ready to do whatever I need to do.Going back to what you just said, your best known roles are probably the comedic ones. Even when you’re playing villains, you’re this badass-with-a-soft-side. But then I saw Gamer earlier this year, and there’s very little humor to your character in that. It was almost shocking, because I don’t remember the last time I saw you in so serious a role. So with that, and now The Expendables, does this mean we could possibly see more straight-up action movies in your future?TC: See, you have to give people what they want. And that’s what I’m saying. I did Gamer, but not a lot of people saw that movie. People noticed me in that movie after a while, but… Now that this has kind of broke all the way open, it’s just really wide open for me now, because now I have a two-way goal. It’s not farfetched for people to see me as a dad on TV, but it’s also not farfetched to see me blowing away fifty people. [laughs] I know I’m in a very, very special place, because not a lot of people can handle both things. It’s a very, very unique spot, and I’m just honored to have it, and I don’t plan on losing it. I’m willing to do it all. I mean, more Old Spice commercials, more of all that stuff. [laughs] Whatever I can do – and do well – is what I want to do.The Expendables comes out on DVD and Blu-Ray in the US tomorrow, November 23rd.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"All, in, italian, Trailer","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/dsafas.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-terry-crews"},{"id":"47508852834666","title":"Five Favorite Films with Danny Trejo","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Danny TrejoThe star of Machete also talks about a sequel and working on a daytime soap.by Matt Atchity | January 12, 2011 |  CommentsOne of the most notable and recognizable “that guy” actors in Hollywood, Danny Trejo has appeared in countless movies and TV shows, doing everything from broad comedy (Bubble Boy) to action (Con Air, xXx) to children’s movies (Spy Kids) to voice work on TV (King of the Hill) and even video games (Grand Theft Auto: Vice City). He’s shared screen time with some of the biggest stars, including George Clooney, Johnny Depp, Robert De Niro, and Harrison Ford, just to name a few, and discovered he was second cousin to director Robert Rodriguez while the two were working on Rodriguez’s 1995 film Desperado. Last year alone, in fact, Trejo acted in two high profile (and well-received) action films attached to Rodriguez: Predators, which Rodriguez produced, and Machete, which Rodriguez directed.With the Certified Fresh Machete hitting video store shelves just last week, we were lucky enough to sit and chat with Trejo, who gave us his Five Favorite Films and went on to talk about working with people he admires, a Machete sequel, and his appearance on a certain daytime soap opera. Read on for the full interview!The Searchers (1956, 98% Tomatometer)John Wayne in The Searchers, which is a great movie.Death Wish (1974, 70% Tomatometer)Charles Bronson in Death Wish. Oh, I loved it. I was in Death Wish 4. In fact, that was the first time I had a name in a movie, which was Art Sanella. Most of the time I was “Inmate #1,” you know what I mean?Animal Factory (2000,81% Tomatometer)There was a movie called Animal Factory; it was [written] by Eddie Bunker, and it was directed by Steve Buscemi. It’s probably the best prison movie that’s ever been made. It’s unbelievable. I actually helped produce that. Eddie had the script, was running around with it for a while, and then gave it to me and said, “See what you can do with it.” I remember handing it to Steve Buscemi on Con Air, and I said, “Here, Steve. Read this or I’ll kill you.” [laughs] And he read it. He loved it, but he said, “Danny, there’s nothing really in it for me,” and I said, “No, no, no, we want you to direct it.” So he got Willem Dafoe, and when he got Willem Dafoe, everybody else kind of jumped on it.Dirty Harry (1971,95% Tomatometer)Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry, of course. [laughs]Once Upon a Time in the West (1968, 98% Tomatometer)There’s another western that I really love, with Charles Bronson. It’s called Once Upon A Time in the West. I love westerns. You know, Eastwood, Bronson, Henry Fonda, they were the best for westerns.Next, Danny Trejo on working with big names, a possible Machete sequel, and appearing on a daytime soap.RT: You’ve had the chance to work with all these big names, and it almost seems like you’re someone who can look at a movie and say, “You know what? I want to work with that guy someday.” Do those kinds of roles come to you?Danny Trejo: Yeah, well hell, I’m one of those guys that people are saying that about. [laughs] I’m kidding, I’m kidding. That was funny. You know what? It’s like, just give me what you got. I’ve worked with everybody that I really admire. I’d like to work with Clint Eastwood. I’ve never worked with Clint Eastwood; I’d love to work with him. I would love for him to direct a western that I was in, because he just has that eye for westerns. I remember the last western he made, Unforgiven, oh man… I mean, that was a dirty, gritty, way a western’s supposed to be, I didn’t wash my socks kind of movie. [laughs]We get teased at the end of Machete that we’re going to get more Machete pictures…Yeah, I asked Robert Rodriguez when he was going to write Machete Kills, and he said, “It’s written.” So it’s written; now he’s just waiting to find the backing and do it.When are we going to see a Danny Trejo movie with you behind the camera?Uh, that’s too much work. [laughs] You know, I watch Robert. Robert shows up first, and he leaves last. You know, when everybody’s gone, he’s setting up shots for the next day, and then he goes home and edits. Making a movie of that kind, of any kind, is a six-, seven-month commitment, you know, and I’m having too much fun doing what I’m doing.Apart from Machete, do you have a favorite movie that you’ve worked on?Animal Factory was a blast, Spy Kids was a blast, Con Air was just the biggest test in testosterone ever. That was a fun movie to do. And you know, I had fun working on a movie called Bubble Boy. [laughs] With Jake Gyllenhaal, and he was cool. And then I worked later on a film with his sister, Maggie, called Sherrybaby, and that was probably one of the most dramatic roles I played, up until… Machete. [laughs]As you’ve been doing so many action movies, did you ever figure that you’d end up on something like The Young and the Restless.You know, it’s a really funny story about that. My mom never believed I even had a job. I mean, I would come home and say, “Mom, I worked with Robert De Niro!” and she’d go, “I know, mijo, but you need a job. I’ll make you lunch.” You know? “Mom! I’m an actor!” And then I did three episodes, I think, of The Young and the Restless, and she said, “Mijo! You made it! I saw you!” [laughs] She had all of her little group sitting in front of the TV, watching me on The Young and the Restless.So are we going to get a Danny Trejo soap?[laughs] That would be fun. My house would be quite a reality show right there. My wife, right now, is putting together a reality show called Trejo to the Rescue, because she’s a real animal advocate. So we’re doing that, and, you know, whatever comes down, we’re ready to go.Machete is currently available on home video in DVD and Blu-Ray format.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Amazon, America, new, NYCC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/dsafa.jpg","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Danny-Trejo"},{"id":"47508854449518","title":"Five Favorite Films with John Cameron Mitchell","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with John Cameron MitchellThe director of Rabbit Hole, Shortbus and Hedwig and the Angry Inch drops by for a chat.by Luke Goodsell | December 16, 2010 |  CommentsIn the short space of three films, actor-turned-director John Cameron Mitchell has proved both an original and versatile talent. His debut feature, an exuberant adaptation of the stage musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch, imagined the weird and wild journey of a transgender Eastern European glam rocker rattling through middle America, while his acclaimed follow-up, 2006’s notorious sex comedy Shortbus, gave us — among other treats — the particular cinematic experience of watching three naked gentleman perform the American national anthem with their rear ends.This week, marking yet another impressive change of pace, the director returns with the moving Rabbit Hole, a heavy but often humorous drama about a married couple (Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart) trying to negotiate their relationship in the wake of losing their son.We caught up with Mitchell recently, where he shared his Five Favorite Films of all time.A Woman Under the Influence (1974, 89% Tomatometer)I think my favorite film is A Woman Under the Influence, by Cassavetes. Something about its documentary force, this unseen structure of what it means to be a woman in our society. I still think Gena Rowlands’ performance is probably the best I’ve ever seen on screen. You see her desperately trying to be all these things a woman is supposed to be — a great lover, a mother, a wife, a sister, a daughter — and she’s trying so hard that her mind fragments. It’s just heartbreaking and it’s so full of love and everybody’s right and wrong in it.Fanny and Alexander (1982, 100% Tomatometer)I love Fanny and Alexander; Bergman’s masterpiece. I love the five-hour version, the television cut. I think you should see the three-hour version first. It’s almost like a Hansel and Gretel story: it’s this very complex fairy tale of Fanny and Alexander, whose father dies and they have to go live with the evil bishop, and their mother seems kind of brainwashed by him. It’s full of ghosts, but the real scary ghosts aren’t the ones who are “oooh!” — they aren’t Americanized ones, they pop up at the weirdest moments, in a very realistic way. The ending is very spooky. It’s the most beautiful fairy tale I’ve ever experienced that’s not written by a folk tradition, but written by one person — Bergman.Nights of Cabiria (1957,97% Tomatometer)I really love Nights of Cabiria, which I think is Fellini’s best film; starring his wife, Giulietta Masina. I realize that, in retrospect, it may have influenced Hedwig, because it has this hooker who is almost a cross between Ana Magnani in Mamma Roma and maybe Charlie Chaplin, because Giulietta Masina is almost like a silent movie comedian… she’s very kooky. There’s a lot of almost mimed scenes where she’s like Buster Keaton or something — but imagine a female hooker Buster Keaton. She gets knocked down by various lovers and she thinks she’s found that other half and then she’s just knocked down again but she gets back up, and it’s got this incredibly hopeful ending that, in theory, seems impossible — you know, people are dancing around her and music is happening. It’s that weird thing that happens, only in Italy, where there’s that understanding of the melancholy of life — a laughing understanding. It’s just like, “This is life — it involves tears, it involves laughter.” It’s incredibly optimistic, even though the worst thing happens to her.Nashville (1975,95% Tomatometer)I love Nashville. It’s my favorite Altman film, for sure — and I’m a big Altman fan. Another long film that young people don’t always understand the pace of: you know, “Are they really gonna sing all of those songs, straight through?” It’s the pace of life. And the country music scene in Nashville in 1975 being a metaphor for America at that time — the end of the Vietnam War, after Watergate, after the assassinations of some of our most prominent citizens — is encompassed in this comedy with, like, 25 main characters. Lily Tomlin was a revelation as a serious actress in that; there’s an incredible scene where she’s being sung to by Keith Carradine, it’s just heartbreaking. I find it incredibly funny and incredibly moving, and it feels like America.Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964, 100% Tomatometer)There’re a lot of runners up… The Conversation, The King of Comedy… I think I might have to say Dr. Strangelove. The most perfect satire ever made, that I’ve ever experienced in any form — literary or cinematic. Tone perfect. Really a cautionary tale for what it means to be a man in America. It’s all about penis size. That missile? You can’t miss it: it’s between his legs, you know — he’s going down, weighed down by the weight of his penis to destroy the world, and laughing all the way. That’s one film that my parents — who are super-conservative — and I can agree on that’s a great film. My dad was a General. He loves it. He’s some kind of a cross between George C. Scott and Noel Coward. Sense of humor is one of those places where people with different philosophies can commune. We can all agree that it’s absurd. Not always in an objective way, but in a comic way. Kubrick found a kind of consensus, a certain way of looking at the world that’s tied up with what it means to be a man — insanity, and it will lead to tragedy. And Peter Sellers, you know — my favorite comic actor of all time.Rabbit Hole is in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"batman","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Untitled-1.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-john-cameron-mitchell"},{"id":"47508854454640","title":"Five Favorite Films with Amy Adams","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Amy AdamsPlus, the actress on The Fighter and playing tough opposite Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg.by Luke Goodsell | December 8, 2010 |  CommentsMuch like her wayward Disney princess in Enchanted, it’s pretty damn impossible not to like Amy Adams immediately upon meeting her. But in David O. Russell’s heavy-hitting drama The Fighter, Adams has to play hard and more than a little rough as Charlene, boxer Mickey Ward’s (Mark Wahlberg) girlfriend and scorn of his pugilistic clan — including his volatile older brother, Dicky Edlund (Christian Bale).“I have so much affection for David [O. Russell],” Adams says of her sometimes-notorious director, who sought her for the role. “I’m so appreciative that he met me and he was able to see Charlene. So many times in the past a director’s been like, “Can you play tough?”, and I can’t really answer that, because if I answer politely then they’re gonna think I’m not tough, and if I answer like, “Hell yeah I can play tough!”, it doesn’t really work. David got it.”Playing tough meant Adams was well-matched against her co-stars, who’re being touted as Oscar contenders this awards season. “What’s great about this is that, in playing Charlene, I was as tough as they were; so I was able to come to set and really feel like I was toe-to-toe, just because she’s so ballsy. I’m definitely the scrappiest,” she laughs.More intimidating? Picking your all-time five favorite films. “It’s so hard to break it down to five,” Adams says. “For different reasons, I love all of the movies I’m about to mention.”Gone With the Wind (1939, 97% Tomatometer)Gone With the Wind, and The Wizard of Oz, were two movies that I grew up with and had a lasting effect on me. Scarlett O’Hara was a huge influence, unfortunately [laughs], and I had to break myself out of the habit of the sort of “fiddle-dee-dee” kind of thing. As I’ve gotten older and watched the movie, I love the cinematography; it was just such a groundbreaking movie. It’s interesting now to see, in looking back, how we approached race in Hollywood, and how it’s changed so much. It was just epic and romantic and sweeping at that time in my life — usually I pick the movies because of the time I watched them in my life and what they meant to me then. I saw Gone With the Wind when I was about 13, which is a dangerous time to show it to a young lady. [laughs] I was obsessed with it. It was so romantic: the gowns, the drama, the war? and I loved American history, as well; it was my favorite subject. I was a freak on Gone With the Wind.The Wizard of Oz (1939, 100% Tomatometer)Have you done the watching it with the Dark Side of the Moon? You should really do that, it’s very strange.[laughs]Vertigo (1958,98% Tomatometer)I love Alfred Hitchcock, but that was the first one that I saw. I saw it in humanities class in high school. We broke it down and had to write all these articles about it, and it stayed with me for a lot of reasons? in exploring all of the imagery that Alfred Hitchcock uses, and just the tone of the film. I always was a Jimmy Stewart fan — my fiancé is kind of very Jimmy Stewart. [laughs] He’s like the every man. I really loved him. And then of course the Hitchcock blonde; a lot of it had to do with the females in the films, so it’s no surprise that I became an actress. I was obsessed with Kim Novak; I would pull my hair back and try to tweeze my eyebrows so I could be a Hitchcock blonde. I loved it. And that was the first time I’d ever explored film intellectually, in that class, because before then I was, you know, I just went to the movies — things would move me and I wasn’t sure why. To get to sit down with my teacher and break a film down intellectually was a discovery for me. It’s still one of my favorites. It speaks to me very strongly.The Shawshank Redemption (1994,88% Tomatometer)Shawshank is one of those films that, every time it comes on television, I watch it — even though I own the DVD, the VHS, the Blu-ray. Every time it’s on. I can?t explain why. It’s a good script, it’s a good story; it’s a story about the human spirit and redemption… it’s beautiful. That scene when the opera plays, and everybody stops for that moment and you just hear Morgan Freeman’s voice come in, that kills me. It’s really great.Paulie (1998, 61% Tomatometer)If I put Casablanca on I’ll sound like AFI, right? [laughs] Here’s the thing: there are all the choices you can make that you know sound really good and then there’re the ones that you really watch, like a hundred times. Like Paulie, the film with the parrot — but if I put that on my list I’m gonna look like an idiot. [laughs] You must see Paulie! I know you think I’m crazy. I love Paulie. I have these films that my younger brother’s like, “Amy, you’re gonna love this — you have to watch this film.” He introduced me to Paulie. There’s a whole bunch of people in Paulie: there’s Gena Rowlands, Jay Mohr, Cheech; the guy from Monk, Tony Shalhoub, who’s one of my favorites. It’s such a touching story. I hope I haven’t built it up too much. [laughs]The Fighter is in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Yoda, Baby, spider-man, Pop, Video, FOX, National, Cartoon, boxoffice","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wer.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-amy-adams"},{"id":"47508855901566","title":"Five Favorite Films with Michael Shannon","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Michael ShannonThe star of Herzog's My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done and The Runaways biopic delivers his all-time favoritesby Tim Ryan | September 16, 2010 |  CommentsMichael Shannon has made an impressive mark on Hollywood over the past several years. The noted character actor picked up a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his small-but-crucial role in Revolutionary Road. A bigger showcase for Shannon’s talents is Werner Herzog’s My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done, (out this week on DVD) an unconventional police procedural that examines the mind of a man who slowly goes mad. As Brad in My Son, My Son, Shannon convincingly embodies a deeply disturbed man whose life was changed during a rafting trip in Peru. Upon his return to the States, he becomes consumed by religious fervor and his role in a community theater adaptation of Elektra— and the result isn’t pretty. (Shannon also has a key role in the Martin Scorsese-exec-produced HBO series Boardwalk Empire, which premieres late this month.)In an interview with RT, Shannon shared his favorite movies and discussed what it’s like to work with Werner Herzog, what he does to get into character, and why he tends to play obsessive, disturbed types.The King of Comedy (1983,92% Tomatometer)I like The King of Comedy by Scorsese. I like that one. It makes me laugh a lot. I think it’s very funny. I mean, I like the combination, the trio of Robert De Niro, Jerry Lewis and Sandra Bernhard; that’s just one of my favorite trios in a movie. The three of them had a pretty amazing chemistry, I thought. I’ve heard that Scorsese was reluctant to make it, that it was on the shelf for a while; I guess that makes me appreciate it even more.And you’re working with him pretty soon, too — or you have.I worked with him on the pilot for Boardwalk Empire; that was last summer. September 19 that’s premiering. It’s very lavish and lush and beautiful to look at: the costumes, the cars, the sets, the props; a remarkable ornate universe. It’s a really exciting cast, I think. Everyone in it was someone I was excited to work withThe Decalogue (1988,N/A Tomatometer)Well I guess this is cheating because it’s 10 movies, but I like [Krzysztof Kieślowski’s] Decalogue a lot. That’s one director I was sad when he passed away, because I would have loved to have worked with him — although he never really worked with American actors. I love all of his films but Decalogue is very satisfying. When I watched it for the first time I saw them all in two days, as this little cinema in London. I watched five the first day and the second five the next day.Seul Contre Tous (I Stand Alone) (One Against All) (1998,85% Tomatometer)I remember being pretty astonished by I Stand Alone, the Gaspar Noé picture. I remember when I saw that one I was pretty astonished — I’d never seen anything that grim before. But also very honest — not gratuitous or trying to get a shock — just very simple and quite and powerful and disturbing.Alphaville (1965,84% Tomatometer)I like Alphaville a lot, by Godard. Lemmy Caution — I love that guy. That actor [Eddie Constantine], I could watch him all the time. That’s probably one of my favorite performances in a movie.Crumb (1994,95% Tomatometer)It’s a documentary, but I remember liking Crumb a whole lot. When Crumb came out I would go and see it like three times a week; I would be bringing different people to see it. I’d seen a couple of documentaries before, from Errol Morris or whatever, but that, I mean that one took it to a whole other level as far as I was concerned. I just thought it was the most interesting family I’d ever seen in a movie, really.Next: Michael Shannon discusses working with Werner Herzog on My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?, and talks about getting into character on The Runaways.RT: This is the most clichéd question but I have to ask it, because this is the kind of director who, when making a police procedural, will go to Peru and/or the Xinjiang province in China for a shot or two, so — what’s it like working with Werner Herzog?Michael Shannon: I think you kinda summed it up. He’s very determined to do what he wants to do, no matter how outlandish or maybe, you know, unnecessary it may seem to some people. I think he shot the film because he’s been making a lot of documentaries recently, and also Rescue Dawn, which is a much more straightforward picture. I feel like With Bad Lieutenant and My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done he was really exercising his imagination and doing things that he really wanted. He was talking about some shots in My Son, My Son that he’s been wanting to do for years, like things he’s been dreaming about or thinking about for years. So I think he put a lot of that energy and creativity in, particularly into My Son, My Son. But I also thought in Bad Lieutenant it was on display as well.One of the interesting things about your character is that the movie is not a Whodunit, because you know who did it. It’s just the simple fact that his world makes sense to him — there isn’t a sort of an, “Oh I know what made him snap!” moment.Yeah. I really appreciated that aspect, I think. I think it’s pretty foolish to assume that a movie, in the course of an hour and a half, can explain why somebody would drive a sword through their mother’s torso. And I like that instead of trying to explain it in a logical way, to make sense out of it, it just tries to create the point of view and the feeling of it. I’ve seen it a couple of times and every time I see it I notice different things or different themes that jump out, but I don’t think it’s a film to be necessarily understood.Is the message, like a lot of Werner Herzog movies, “Don’t go to South America because you might go nuts?”[laughs] Well I do think to a certain degree that part of it was this whole idea of losing all of his buddies on the trip. Werner always said that, for him, that’s what he wanted to be the genesis of the insanity. That was always interesting to me because I don’t think that’s something that actually happened to Mark, the character that Brad is based on, but a lot of times Werner didn’t seem as interested in telling Mark’s story as he was telling Brad’s story. I guess if he was interesting in telling Mark’s story my character would have been named Mark. The screenwriter, Herbert Golder, he researched Mark thoroughly, and there is a lot in the movie that is based on things that happened to Mark or things that he did. Herb actually met Mark and talked to him. But it was also combined with other things that were in Werner’s mind.You played Kim Fowley [in The Runaways], who you met with briefly. When you’re playing someone like this guy, how much are you trying to capture the person’s nuance? How much are you playing a real guy?Well there is this real difference to me between playing Kim and playing Brad in My Son. For example, in The Runaways I’m playing Kim Fowley, the character’s name is Kim Fowley and it’s a biopic. In that instance I was very aware of an obligation to be as much like Kim Fowley as possible, and I studied him and watched a lot of footage of him. There was one interview with him that I just watched over and over and over again. And I guess pretty much anybody can kinda do that. I mean I obviously physically bear a bit if a resemblance to him, so that helped as well. But it’s a matter of sitting and watching a tape and trying to absorb somebody’s manners and gestures and things. With My Son, it was totally different. Werner discouraged it. He didn’t want me to act like Mark; he didn’t want me to think about Mark at all, really. I guess for him the research had been done in the screenplay and the writing of it, and I didn’t watch any footage of Mark or do any of that kind of stuff.Are you inherently drawn to unhinged characters, or is this what people tend to cast you in — these types of extreme personality roles?It’s probably a combination of things. When people are casting things, movies and what not, they go on impressions they have of people, you know. The impressions they have of you are based on what they’ve seen you in. But I also think I find a lot of differences in the characters I’ve played, regardless of whether they may be violent or angry or act out or, you know, have lapses of control. I still find them all pretty interesting in their own regard, and not incredibly similar. I think if you took scenes from each of the films and put them on a loop, or played them back to back, you would maybe see more of the subtle differences between them. I think part of the reason I got into this was because I’m generally in touch with the uneasy side of myself and things in general, probably. I think the world’s an uneasy place, filled with anxiety and problems, so maybe the voices of the characters I play are representative of that.Are you still doing live theater, in Chicago and such?Yeah I did a play in Chicago last fall that I’m actually hoping to move to New York this fall. I live in New York and I go back to Chicago occasionally, but I’m still a member of a theater company there in Chicago. I like to do as much theater as possible but it’s getting increasingly difficult to make time for it. But no matter what I think I will continue to do it.Did you ever encounter any “Brad” types in your various theater experiences?Oh. [laughs] Yeah, that’s interesting, you know. I guess, particularly when you’re younger, there’s a little bit of that — people get upset with their parts and what not, and there’s this whole notion of creating a separate reality or everything needs to be realistic or lifelike: “I have to become this person in order to do my job.” I think that it’s something you find a lot with younger actors. I was probably guilty of it in my day. When you get older, at least for me, the transformation has become less about, “I have to become someone else” than, “I have to tell a story”. It’s more about being a participant in the act of telling a story; being more focused on the story as a whole and less on myself, you know. I think that happens to a lot of people as they get older. You become a little less self-centered and more cognizant of the world around you.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"ID, know, aliens, Month, indiana, cinematic, television, Crunchyroll","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Michael-Shannon"},{"id":"47615296015752","title":"Billy Bob to Become an \"Astronaut Farmer\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Billy Bob to Become an \"Astronaut Farmer\"by Scott Weinberg | August 22, 2005 |  CommentsBilly Bob Thornton will star in the Polish Brothers’ satire known as \"The Astronaut Farmer,\" says Variety.

In 1995, she earned critical accolades – and a Best Actress Oscar nomination – for her gritty performance in Leaving Las Vegas. She’s remained selective about the roles she’s taken over the years, and this week she takes center stage as Sheriff Julie Forester in Alexandre Aja’s Piranha 3-D. She was kind enough to chat with RT about her Five Favorite Films, as well as what it was like working on the new movie. Read on for the full interview.Ordinary People (1980,91% Tomatometer)Ordinary People is a really important movie to me, because it was a movie I watched and had the spark of idea that I wanted to be an actress. Basically because of Timothy Hutton’s performance, and the visceral nature of that movie, the rawness of the emotion. I think at a young age — I was fourteen or fifteen — I felt like I could relate to him, and then this weird thing happened where I felt like I was him. While I was watching the movie, I felt like I was feeling exactly what he was feeling, and I thought, “Wow… I would love to be in a movie like that.”Jaws (1975,100% Tomatometer)The other movie that was really influential to me was Jaws. I was only 12, and that I thought was real! I even thought Charlie’s Angels was real! There was such an innocence in our culture when we were growing up, as if this was real life, and maybe there are cameras watching that. [I thought], “They’re not fake. These aren’t actors. This is real.” I don’t know why our parents weren’t helping us with that.The Godfather (1972,100% Tomatometer)My husband, Davis (Guggenheim), really turned me on to The Godfather as being the quintessentially best movie that was ever made. I started to appreciate why he loved that movie more than any other.Forrest Gump (1994,70% Tomatometer)I really like Forrest Gump. I do think that’s a perfect movie in some ways. I love Tom Hanks in that movie. I’m really attracted to an innocence in some performances that really touch me in a deeper way.The Shining (1980,87% Tomatometer)And The Shining! It totally freaked me out and made me never want to see a horror movie again.Next, Shue talks about the harsh filming conditions she endured on the set of Piranha 3-D.RT: You brought up Jaws… Is Piranha 3-D your chance to do something like that?Elisabeth Shue: Yeah, isn’t that odd? I think we were all attracted to that idea… can we make the Jaws of this generation? Is it possible? You know, obviously it was going to be incredibly different. But the thing that we remember about Jaws is that it was so terrifying, but it was actually exciting, too. That’s how scary it was: you were excited by the fear, not disgusted by it. It wasn’t so dark, like a slasher movie; there was no slasher involved. It was just raw fear of a beast that you couldn’t predict. So I think there’s a little of that in Piranha that is exciting, and a pop culture, fear, fun movie.And you’ve got Richard Dreyfuss, too.We have that, too. And Chrisopher Lloyd, who is wonderful. He sort of brought back that excitement from Back to the Future (that’s another great movie, so perfect in its innocence).Before you took the role in Piranha 3-D, did you know that Christopher would be working on this?I did not know. I was the first cast, I have to say.So you’re the one who attracted everyone else, right?No, no! [laughing] But I took the leap. I took the full leap. Well, I didn’t fully because Alex (director Alexandre Aja) was attached. I think you’d take the full leap if there was no director attached and you decided to do this movie. Because obviously you could imagine many different versions. I did know that it was Alex, so it wasn’t a huge leap.What was it about Alex’s past work that attracted you to this project?What I trust with him is that he got the reality, that Spring Breakers being mauled by piranha would be done in a way that would be so visceral and real and awful, and kind of horrific. And would have humor. And would have that sort of campy element to it, because it’s still Spring Break, and Spring Break itself is absurd. So the reality of that was going to be there, and I knew that he wanted to heighten that. Because I was going to be forced to hold down the reality of the story, I was going to be the mother saving her children and trying to save the town, I needed to trust that he cared about that. From all of his movies, it was obvious that the emotions of the characters mattered to him more than anything else.It’s got to be fun to do a movie like this, right?It is fun. It’s everything. The first week, we all laughed that it wasn’t even like making a movie; the first week was like Survivor. It was like we were on the show Survivor and there were hidden cameras, and everyone was wanting to see who was going to break first, because we came from 80 degrees to 120 degrees. I had on big boots, polyester sherriff’s uniform, gun belt. And then we were on the water, all day long, with sun beating down, with no clouds to be seen, day after day after day. To the point that there was one scene, where I’m on a boat, telling people to get out of the water, and I had a short thing to say, and I couldn’t remember any line, at all. My brain had completely gone, because I was having heat stroke. And we were all drinking our own concoctions of water and Gatorade. But then our blood thinned after a week, and everyone settled in. Then I think the intensity of the conditions helped the movie. I think there’s an intensity to the movie that’s driven by the fact that we were all surviving a really intense experience in reality. That was real sweat out there! They weren’t spraying us down. Waiting for those shots of the massacre, you’d be sitting on this boat and there’d be ten half-dead bodies, and they’d be coming in and spraying blood and wetting them down, and then you’d be waiting and waiting and waiting on this teeny boat, with fifty bodies and there’s nowhere to move and there’s nowhere to go, and you just wait. There’s a lot of that that made the whole experience sort of mirror the massacre; the filming was almost as intense and the people getting chewed up.What’s coming up for you?I’m doing two smaller movies. One hopefully we’ll get into a festival; it’s called Janie Jones. It’s with Abigail Breslin and Alessandro Nivola. It’s a really wonderful story that I hope breaks through. And then I’m leaving in two weeks to go to Ottowa to work with Jennifer Lawrence and Max Thieriot and a wonderful English director, Mark Tonderai. We’re going to go and do a Psycho kind of thriller. More psychological, but in the horror genre, but not in the gory, bloody genre.Piranha 3-D, starring Elisabeth Shue, Ving Rhames, and Jerry O’Connell, opens in the US on August 20th.

The New York-based independent artist, noted for animating every frame of his films himself, has worked across movies, graphic novels, and music video, receiving two Oscar nominations for his short films. He’s also famed for his long running cartoon strip, Plympton, and has contributed to The New York Times, Rolling Stone and National Lampoon, to name just a few. His sixth animated feature Idiots and Angels, which opens in New York and Los Angeles this month, is the story of an irascible drunk who wakes up with angels wings — and features music by the one and only Tom Waits. We spoke to Plympton recently and asked him to share his all-time favorite films.Mind Game (2004,N/A Tomatometer)I want to start off with a film you’ve probably seen called Mind Game, by Masaaki Yuasa. It’s a very interesting story. It’s a Japanese film; it’s not anime. It’s very western, actually. It came out in 2005, and critics panned it in Japan, and therefore the producers lost their nerve and shelved the film, which is very sad. I saw it at the Asian Film Festival, and I think you can see it online, but to me, it’s the Citizen Kane of animation. It is such an ambitious and visually unique film. It’s just full of action and full of crazy ideas and surrealism and humor and just beautiful, beautiful craftsmanship.The Producers (1968,93% Tomatometer)Number two is The Producers by Mel Brooks, of course. The reason I like this one is that it’s essentially a cartoon with live actors. They’re so over the top and so exaggerated, and of course the Germans, and Hitler and everything. It’s just like a wacky, wacky Warner Bros. cartoon with live actors. And also, the idea is so unique and so fresh and so dark. It’s a very bleak, dark idea, and I love that.Dead Alive (1992,85% Tomatometer)The next one would be Dead Alive by Peter Jackson. Again, another animated cartoon with live actors, and this is a film that really showed me how you can take a violent, dark situation and make it comic. Lots of blood, lots of decapitation, lots of violence, and yet it’s a comedy. That was a big influence on me when I started doing I Married a Strange Person!. I really referred a lot to Dead Alive.Pillow Talk (1959,91% Tomatometer)And then another one called Pillow Talk. That’s a little change of pace here, but it is a film that I always love to watch. I must have seen it 10 times. I don’t remember the director’s name, but I know the writer, Stanley Shapiro, is really great with social satire and the battle of the sexes. For me, it’s a film I continue to laugh at each time I see it. The jokes never get stale.Baby Doll (1956,100% Tomatometer)I guess lastly is Baby Doll by Elia Kazan, where Karl Malden plays a sexually inexperienced husband, and his wife plays him for a fool, pretending to be a 12-year-old nymphette. Again it’s a very Southern Gothic, surreal, sexual perversion escapade. It’s another film I’ve watched many times and find it very hilarious.Next, we talk to Bill about his latest project, Idiots and Angels.RT: So let’s talk about your latest project.BP: Yeah, Idiots and Angels is a very different direction for me. Certainly there’s humor in it, and there’s crazy action in it, but there’s also a deeper story. It is about a man who’s lost his soul, and these wings start growing out of his back, and he must make a decision about whether to be an a**hole or change his life and be a good guy. Now, I’m not big on morality tales and teaching moral lessons, but I just thought it was a wonderful concept to create this guy who’s a real moral quandary and has to fight off people who are trying to steal his wings. I thought it’d be a really good opportunity to have a lot of wacky flying around, and a lot of sort of semi-religious imagery and things like that. Near the end it gets very bizarre, very strange.As someone who’s seen a lot of your stuff, it’s funny to hear you, of all people, call something strange, given your history. That’s a bold statement.Well, it’s very different for a number of reasons, also. One is that there’s no dialogue in the film. It’s the first time I’ve done a feature with no dialogue. I’ve done a number of shorts with no dialogue, but I wanted to see if I could do a feature film with no dialogue. So the music takes the place of the dialogue, and I was able to enlist Tom Waits, who I’ve been a fan of for a long time. His music works very well simply because it takes place in a bar, and there’s a lot of people drinking. Now, I never met Tom Waits, but I’m friends with Jim Jarmusch, so I asked him to show Mr. Waits the rough cut of the film. I didn’t hear anything for about three weeks, so I was freaking out, and then I got an email from his wife saying, “Tom loves the film. You can have any song you want from his library.” And I had to pay just a nominal fee for the music rights, which says a lot about Tom Waits, how he likes to support projects that interest him, and he’s not out to become a billionaire.That had to be a real treat for someone who’s been a fan for a long time.Yeah, it was really nice, really nice. Still haven’t met him, never even talked to him. It was all done via email with his wife. We sent him a copy of the film, so I hope he likes it.Another interesting aspect of the film is it was done entirely pencil-on-paper. I usually draw every frame of my films, and I did it again here, but I usually have someone else do the shading or the coloring, that kind of thing. But here I did all the shading and all the texture, pencil on paper, and we scanned it onto computer and manipulated the artwork on computer, and I really like the way it looked. It’s just a much darker, cartoon noir feel. It was something that I’ve been trying to do ever since I started out doing animation with Your Face. It’s so easy to make a film this way. It was really a delightful process.You have a really painstaking method, because you’re drawing everything yourself.You know, people say I’m a masochist by doing every drawing by myself, but I actually feel that I’m a hedonist. It just feels so comfortable, it’s so much fun. I can spend twelve, fourteen hours a day drawing a film, and at the end of the day, I feel refreshed and relaxed and joyful. So it’s an exercise that I love to do, I love to draw, and if I could just spend the rest of my life drawing every day, I would be the happiest guy in the world.So how long does it take you to make a feature-length film, then?Well, the storyboard and character design took about a year, the actual animation took about a year, and then the post-production and music and editing and everything took about half a year, so it’s about two and a half, almost three years to make the film, which is actually pretty quick, compared to a Disney or Pixar film. You know, sometimes it takes six or seven years for them to make a feature film.Have you ever considered getting into the CGI world at all?I would if someone funded me. As you know, it’s very expensive. A DreamWorks film costs $150 million, $200 million sometimes, so I just don’t have that kind of pocket change. However, if Pixar came to me and said, “Would you like to direct our new feature?” I would be very excited. As you know, Brad Bird started out in 2D, and he made a wonderful transition to 3D, so I wouldn’t mind doing the same thing.Idiots and Angels opens at the IFC Center in New York on Wednesday, October 6 and runs through October 12, with screenings in Los Angeles later this month.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"MCU, versus, DGA, popular, Tumblr","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-With-Animator-Bill-Plympton"},{"id":"47508854473080","title":"Five Favorite Films with Aaron Johnson","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Aaron JohnsonThe star of Kick-Ass and this week's John Lennon film Nowhere Boy shares his favorites.by Luke Goodsell | October 8, 2010 |  CommentsStepping into the shoes of a musical icon is never an easy role, particularly when that person is none other than The Beatles’ singer-songwriter John Lennon, a bonafide 20th-century pop giant. Yet in this week’s Nowhere Boy — which explores the rocker’s turbulent teenage life before he was famous — British actor Aaron Johnson manages to move beyond mere impersonation, giving an affecting performance that captures the young Lennon’s essence. That Johnson was just 18 at the time is impressive, as is the fact that he went directly from filming his lead in this year’s superhero riff Kick-Ass to the very different role of a tortured teenager in 1950s Liverpool.We spoke to Aaron recently about playing Lennon, and whether there’ll be a Kick-Ass sequel; but first, we asked him to run through his five favorite films. “Obviously these are all a bunch of classic, cult movies,” he points out. “It’s probably not that interesting for people to hear me say them, because they’re like the best f**king movies anyway.”Pulp Fiction (1994,94% Tomatometer)Pulp Fiction was probably one of the first films I ever saw that really kind of took effect on me. I was about four years old — obviously wasn’t supposed to be seeing that film; my sister kind of sneaked it out and we got to see it. She’s older than me. That was something I always used to watch. I loved the scenes with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson; when I was older I could understand a little more. It was funny, me and my sister would have this little running thing where we’d know the lines to Ezekiel 25:17. My sister actually bought me a wallet that had “Bad Mother F**ker” written on it. But yeah, Tarantino. That was where my appreciation of directors began. It was beyond the actors at that point. Everything he’s touched I’ve loved. I became a huge fan of him and his work.Fight Club (1999,81% Tomatometer)David Fincher, man — Fight Club, Se7en, those things. This was another film that when I watched it at the time I had to watch it again, to understand it almost. I was just entranced with it. The performances were fantastic — Helena Bonham Carter, Brad Pitt, Ed Norton. I just thought it was brilliant and shot beautifully.Apocalypse Now (1979,98% Tomatometer)Francis Ford Coppola, man. Just the stories that happened on that set. And the soundtrack that they use in that film is so f**king cool. Great performances and a wonderful, entrancing movie — Brando and Dennis Hopper and Duvall. “I love the smell of napalm in the morning” — what a great quote.Boogie Nights (1997,92% Tomatometer)Paul Thomas Anderson — what a fantastic director. These are all directors that I would love to work with, you know. I doubt any of them could give a sh*t. [laughs.] Boogie Nights. Pretty epic. It just captured that era so brilliantly. Mark Wahlberg, man — great role. Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman — they just blow me away. I could watch it again and again. Great movie.The Big Lebowski (1998,78% Tomatometer)I mean, Jeff Bridges, John Turturro — so f**king funny, man. The Coens too.Next, Aaron talks about a Kick-Ass sequel and how he got into character as John Lennon..RT: So, I guess we have to ask: is there a Kick-Ass sequel in any stage of development?Aaron Johnson: No. I mean I’d happily do a sequel and I’d love to do that character again. It was a lot of fun. The comic book writers are writing the comic book and I guess we’ll make the movie when we come around to it, which is not gonna be very soon. It’s gonna be a while.You haven’t talked to Matthew [Vaughn, director] about it?Oh yeah we’ve talked about it a bunch of times, but Matthew’s doing X-Men, you know, and who knows — he might take another job on before he goes on to Kick-Ass again. He’s the one who’s got the rights to it, so he might hold off a bit. Sometimes it’s nice to do that. Why bang one straight out? Give it a bit of time for people to digest it, and get everyone’s expectations pumped up; maybe get the comic book out and it might be on peoples’ minds. At the moment there are just tons of comic book movies being made, other than X-Men, Spider-man, The Avengers, Iron Man — all those main ones — there are all these other ones like Red and Cowboys and Aliens. It’s this era where every comic book that comes out is turned into a movie.You were actually shooting Kick-Ass when you auditioned for Nowhere Boy — is it true that you went in as John Lennon?Yeah. I spent my lunch breaks on Kick-Ass listening to Lennon and trying to go into that. I had my day off and went into the casting just saying these things off the top of my head — out loud even — these lines that Lennon had said. And I tried to look like him, in a black t-shirt and jeans, and slicked my hair back.Were you daunted when you got the role?Not really — just excited, you know. And then I thought, “Sh*t, I gotta do this justice. I gotta do it right.” And that meant just doing as much research as possible and knowing every angle — studying the music, every piece of documentary footage. I watched every interview, you know. I did that every day for two months. I mean, there’s f**king tons of it out there, man. [laughs] There’s not just a couple of hours of tape or something.Director Sam Taylor-Wood said that it wasn’t until she set foot in Liverpool that she felt the weight of Lennon’s legacy, because everyone there had some connection to him, or had an opinion. Did you find a similar thing happened?Yeah. You really kind of felt the weight of it when you were in Liverpool because these were the people who, you know — it was their ground. These people were distraught when The Beatles left and went to America, because it was like, “This is our band, this is our thing.” And they still keep that to them, you know. But they’re lovely. You bump into anyone in Liverpool and they probably bumped into Lennon or Paul [McCartney]; it’s that sort of community where it’s, “I knew his mum” or “I knew his cousin” or “We saw him for the first time live in the Cavern.” Do you know what I mean? It’s like they’ve always got stories to tell.When Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney saw your performance, did they give you any feedback?Yeah. Yoko was hugely supportive and complimentary of our performances. She gave her blessing, and she’s still going out there now saying “go and see Nowhere Boy” — having that understanding of Lennon and knowing his art and his background and having that insight into that. And Paul, the same, just thought it was f**king brilliant. He said to Sam, “You did a good job.”Even though he got punched in the face in the film?He said he couldn’t remember that happening. [laughs]Nowhere Boy is in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"television, Music","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Aaron-Johnson"},{"id":"47508855913862","title":"Five Favorite Films with Jeff Bridges","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Jeff BridgesThe Best Actor winner and star of Tron Legacy talks sequels and working with new technology.by Matt Atchity | July 24, 2010 |  CommentsThe cabanas at the Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego make for a much-needed dose of tranquility, compared to the chaos across the street at the San Diego Convention Center during Comic-Con. Recent Oscar-winner Jeff Bridges warmly welcomed us in to his temporary haven, and offered to share the fresh fruit and vegetables he was having for lunch. For this particular Five Favorite Films, we thought we’d try and change things up a bit; Mr. Bridges has an extensive filmography, so we thought we’d ask him to share five favorite films that he himself had appeared in. He was game for that, saying “I think the five I’ll give you will be ones maybe ones that are little more obscure, ones that people might not know about.” With that, here are Jeff Bridges’ Five Favorite (Jeff Bridges) Films.The Amateurs (2005,17% Tomatometer)I made a film not too long ago that was originally called The Moguls, and then they changed the title to The Amateurs. Written and directed by a fellow by the name of Michael Traeger. First time director, I’ve had great success with first time guys. He assembled a brilliant cast. We had Ted Danson, Glenne Headly, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Joey Pantoliano, Tim Blake Nelson, Bill Fichtner, a wonderful cast, and it was about a small town making a porn movie. This was before that movie that came out, Zack &amp; Miri Make a Porno. Anyway, it was a wonderful film, got great laughs, and then it got picked up by a distributor who went bankrupt and took about five or six movies down with him and the movies got very small releases. It’s a film that I’m very proud of, makes me laugh, I think people will like it, so you might check that out.Tideland (2005,30% Tomatometer)Another movie that I’ll maybe bring some attention to… not one of, but I think the strangest movie that I’ve ever been involved with, with the strangest character was a Terry Gilliam movie called Tideland. And this one is really great. We had a wonderful time making it. You know, these big-budgeted movies… Fisher King was a pretty big-budget movie and Terry kind of goes after these big-budget things that need a lot of money to pull off what he has in mind. But this one was very low-tech and not a giant budget movie. We shot it in Canada and I play a junkie rock star in it for some of the film, and for a lot of the film, I’m a carcass, you know, a dead body. It’s based on a great book with the same title by Mitch Cullin, and very, very surreal. I’d even stretch it and say it’s the weirdest movie that Terry has ever made, for my tastes (although everyone’s got different tastes). But it’s macabre.The Last Picture Show (1971,100% Tomatometer)Let me talk about Last Picture Show… that’s just popped into my mind. For me, that’s a movie that is kind of like no other movie, and no other movie is like it. It just kind of sits there by itself. I guess Peter Bogdonovich is to blame for that, and of course Larry McMurtry, the great writer. We had a chance, like Tron, where we got to do the sequel to Picture Show; twenty years later we shot Texasville. There are three more installments that Larry wrote, that I’m hoping will get made.Crazy Heart (2009,92% Tomatometer)Let me say Crazy Heart, because it’s in my head. It’s prompted where my life is going now, because with Crazy Heart, it really fired up all my music. I’ve been doing music since I was a teenager; I put out an album a few years ago and built a label with Michael McDonald and Chris Pelonis. With Crazy Heart, I got to play with my two dear friends, Stephen Bruden and T-Bone Burnett, who I met on Heaven’s Gate, thirty years ago or something like that. With this music that was stirred up with Crazy Heart, now I want to continue doing that. So I’m going to take the rest of the year and get into my music; I’ve formed a little band up in Santa Barbara, where we’ve been playing some local gigs and we’re going to go out and play some more. That’s going to be fun.Bad Company (1972,90% Tomatometer)You know what movie popped into my mind? Bad Company. Do you know that movie? This was Robert Benton’s first film, another first-time director that I had great success with. Gordy Willis shot it, you know, the guy who shot The Godfather. This one takes place in the 1860s. It’s about two guys, myself and Barry Brown (a wonderful actor who’s no longer with us), that are running away from the draft of The Civil War, so they decided to go West. An interesting sideline to that; we get a band of guys that fall in with us, John Savage is one of those guys, and who do we run into during our travels but David Huddleston. You know who he is… the Big Lebowski!Next, Bridges talks about what it’s like getting into the spirit of acting for the green screen.RT: Is Tron: Legacy the only other sequel you’ve done, apart from Texasville?Jeff Bridges: Yeah!What lured you back 30 years later?Pretty much the same thing that brought me to the original party, which was taking advantage of the most up-to-date technological advancements. This film was certainly chock-full of that kind of stuff. You know, making a movie without cameras, using these optical sensors; it’s fascinating.Does the new technology change how you’re working?Very much so. It’s actually made the whole acting process come full-circle; I think of acting as coming out of a child’s imagination. When we were kids, we pretended to be things. And then as you become a professional actor, you get to wear the costumes, and be on the sets. Those outer elements make it easier for you to get into the reality of where you are as the character. And you learn how to work with the camera, and the lighting and so forth. Now, with this motion capture technology, where there are no cameras, you’re in tights with sensors, black dots on your face, and a hundred of these optical sensors pointing at you, and everything, from the costumes, make-up, camera angles, lighting, the set, everything is done in post-production. So if they say “Let’s start this scene on Jeff’s ear, and we want to whip by and go around his hand,” it’s all done in post. Initially, that kind of rubbed against my acting fur. As I was saying, I like to have the costume and such, that all adds to the experience. So the big challenge for me was to lose my resentment, because there’s nothing like resentment to be the biggest buzzkill going. In that resentment mode, it’s very hard to let the good stuff come out; you want to be relaxed, and enjoying it to a degree. Once I recognized that resentment in myself, I worked at dancing to the tune that was being played. It was like you’re going to party and they’re playing Viennese waltz, and you came here to cha-cha, man, and I’m f—ing pissed, you know? So you have to dance the dance that’s being played. Once I got into that groove, I noticed it was very much like pretending when you were a kid, when you didn’t have all the fancy costumes and sets, and you had to do it in your mind. That’s a new kind of skill, and it will be interesting to see how it’s developed in the future; you know acting schools and teachers will deal with that. It’s a different thing.Tron: Legacy, starring Jeff Bridges, Garrett Hedlund, and Olivia Wilde, opens in the US on December 17.Be sure to check out the rest of our 2010 Comic-Con coverage in our San Diego Comic-Con 2010 Headquarters.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Sematary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Jeff-Bridges"},{"id":"47508857435542","title":"Five Favorite Films With Cheech &amp; Chong","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films With Cheech &amp; ChongWhich movies spark up the lives of a legendary duo?by Alex Vo | April 22, 2010 |  CommentsAs the elder statesmen of stoner movies, a reputation achieved across a dozen films (including the classicUp in Smoke), Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong have found remarkable endurance, their pothead alter egos now spanning decades in popularity. After a long hiatus, the two reunited last year for a massive comedy tour, captured on film asCheech and Chong’s Hey Watch This. Out promoting the release of this documentary (released today in limited release, DVD &amp; Blu-Ray, and video-on-demand channels), Rotten Tomatoes sat down with the legendary duo for their Five Favorite Films.A HardDay’s Night (1964,100% Tomatometer) /Badlands(1973, 98%)Cheech Marin: My favorite film of all time is A Hard Day’sNight. With the Beatles. First of all, it’s the Beatles. I’ve seen it 30times.Tommy Chong: My favorite is still Badlands. It wasCharlie Sheen’s dad, Martin Sheen. It was his first movie, I think. Terry Malickis the director; Sissy Spacek, who was a young, 14-year-old girl.CM: Yeah, and she looked 12. That’s the part that really gothim.TC: Warren Oates played the father. The most artistic, hauntingstudy of a serial killer that I’ve ever seen; you felt empathy for this guy whowas killing people. It was phenomenal. It didn’t do anything at the box office.Rotten Tomatoes: It’s a classic now.CM: That and a quarter will get you 25 cents.Chinatown (1974,100% Tomatometer) / Annie Hall (1977, 98%)CM: Chinatown. It’s the quintessential LA story and itexplains how the Department of Water and Power got into place. It’s just allthese dark themes with such great period nostalgia. It haunts you. It’s becomepart of the lexicon.TC: Let’s see, for me… The trouble with me is that I see films,but I can never remember them. I can describe for you who was in it.CM: Did it have black guys shooting guns? I like the one wherethe black guys were shooting guns.TC: Annie Hall. Diane Keaton was amazing.CM: Yeah, it was the first white girl he ever wanted to f–k.That was amazing right there. Of all the white girls, her?&nbsp;TheGodfather Trilogy (1972-1990, –) /Pulp Fiction(1994, 94%)CM: The Godfather. But you can’t say The GodfatherI or II or III. You gotta take them all together,because, you know, they’re all of a piece. So, Godfather. Those areprobably the most memorized dialogue of any film ever made. You could say anyline from any of those three pictures — well, two and a half, anyway — andpeople would know what you’re referring to.TC: Pulp Fiction.CM: Pulp Fiction is yours? [claps] How current.TC: Pulp Fiction.You know what time it was on theclocks in Pulp Fiction? It was 4:20 every time you saw a clock.CM: Really?TC: Yeah. That’s pop culture lexicon. It’s always 4:20 in PulpFiction.Hannah andHer Sisters (1986, 93% Tomatometer) /TheShawshank Redemption (1994, 88%)CM: I like Hannah and Her Sisters. I’m a really bigWoody Allen fan. I love all his stuff except for the crap.Ironically, I always wanted to be in a Woody Allen movie, and I was, but it wasa movie he just acted in, Picking up the Pieces. It was the worst movieI was ever in. Everybody in it was a big star, was some name, Alfonso Arau wasthe director, Vittorio Storaro was the DP. It was like all the world’s bestingredients mixed in a cup full of vomit. I couldn’t even watch me, that’s howbad it was.But Hannah and Her Sisters. I just love the multiple storylines goingon, and then Woody Allen gets soft at the end, and it becomes sentimental. Butthe thing I really liked was the piano score, the acoustic piano score that runsthroughout. It’s really the thing that ties it together, emotionally. I thoughtthat was one of his best movies.TC: The Shawshank Redemption. The title threw me atfirst. Before I went to jail, I started watching [every jail movie]. That wasone of them.I was trying to write a book, and I was having trouble. You know, I didn’t havethe right publisher; they just wanted a book. I hooked up with this writer, aghost writer, and he wrote a script for me, like, overnight. It was my story,but told from a bong’s point of view, and the bong gets put in federal prison. Aweek later the feds come in. There was some weird cosmic thing going on.The SevenSamurai (1954,100% Tomatometer) /Kill Bill Vol. 1(2003, 85%)CM: I think I like The Seven Samurai. I went back andsaw it. Interesting soundtrack. Saxophones.RT: Do you pay a lot of attention to sound in movies?CM: I do. We’re all musicians.TC: Kill Bill? I don’t remember seeing it all the waythrough. I don’t know what I was doing.CM: There’s two of them.TC: I’ve never seen either one of them. I think that’s becausemy wife has control of the remote.

Over a 20-odd-year career, the Italian-born photographer turned director has made music clips for artists including David Bowie, The Cure, Bjork and The White Stripes, priming her for her debut feature this year, The Runaways. Written and directed by Sigismondi, the film charts the combustible short life of influential ’70s all-girl band The Runaways, with Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning rocking out of character in the lead roles of Joan Jett and Cherie Currie. We spoke with the director recently and asked her to name her all-time five favorite films.A Clockwork Orange (1971,90% Tomatometer)What I love about it is that Kubrick’s making a social statement and it’s very kind of hyper-real. It’s a world that I love so much — it’s slightly futuristic.The Tenant (1976,90% Tomatometer)I’m really drawn to that film because it was always riding that fine line between sanity and insanity, and how anybody can kind of go off into that insane world. And actually you don’t know. It was really striking to me, and also [Polanski’s] performance in that film is pretty amazing.Edward Scissorhands (1990,91% Tomatometer)I love, and am finding a new interest in, Edward Scissorhands, with the outsider and how he’s not finished. There’s something really endearing and close to my heart about that one. It was just beautiful.Sid &amp; Nancy (1986,90% Tomatometer)The way it captured that scene; and again, there are really amazing performances in that movie.Mamma Roma (1962,100% Tomatometer)It’s Anna Magnani, with this little kid, and she’s a prostitute.

In her most recent film, Just Wright, Latifah stars opposite fellow hip-hopper Common in a romantic comedy about a basketball star trying to find his way back to the NBA after an injury, and perhaps play a little one-on-one with a little something called “love” along the way.

He gained widespread acclaim as Sherriff Seth Bullock on HBO’s Deadwood, faced off against Bruce Willis in Live Free or Die Hard, romanced Jennifer Garner in Catch and Release, and left a trail of destruction in Hitman. With his latest, a remake of George Romero’s The Crazies, hitting theaters this week, Olyphant spoke to RT about some of his favorite movies; In particular, he shared his admiration for David Lynch and several flicks he thinks should have won big at the Academy Awards.Blue Velvet (1986,90% Tomatometer)I love Blue Velvet. Put that in there. Alright, this’ll take forever if we talk about what I love about David Lynch. I love that guy. He’s one of the people out there that I just can’t get enough of. I just love everything. I love the way he does it. I love that at first you think it’s weird. [But] it’s actually not weird at all. It makes total f—g sense to me. And you know what I love about it? It seems like it should be pretentious, but there’s nothing pretentious about it. That story creeps you out, it’s fascinating, it’s funny. And [it’s got] dialogue like, “Heineken? F— that s—. Pabst Blue Ribbon!” That’s poetry.RT: When you were preparing for The Crazies, did you watch the original, or do you try to have a fresh approach?TO: It really depends. You know, with The Crazies, I saw some of the stuff from the original; I haven’t seen the picture as a whole. I’ve read a great deal about [George] Romero; I found him to be a really fascinating guy. He seemed like a cool cat. He actually seemed — speaking of David Lynch — there’s something about both those men that I really like. They’re kind of just like kids, in terms of going for it. There’s nothing worse than a message movie. There’s nothing worse than something that’s just like, “Okay, I get it. You got something you’re trying to teach us.” What’s cool about Romero is that, you know, I grew up watching those Dead films. I remember loving them, being freaked out and scary. You know, reading about them, and hearing that they were about American consumerism and stuff, that he’s got something on his mind. It only makes them more interesting, and you don’t lose any of the enjoyment. What sounded really cool about The Crazies, was that it operated on those levels as well. In a way, that was what [Crazies director] Breck [Eisner] and I were really inspired by.RT: And The Crazies is set in a seemingly normal small town, where things are not always what they seem underneath the surface, like Blue Velvet.TO: Oh, that opening shot [in Blue Velvet]. Going down under that pretty grass, seeing all those bugs. Yeah, that’s just as good as it gets.Chariots of Fire (1981, 86% Tomatometer)You know, I like Chariots of Fire. I always liked that one. I like the [line], “When I run, I feel His pleasure.” I can’t get enough of that. I’m a sucker for the [soundtrack]. I love the whole thing. Running with purpose. That was a good one.Pulp Fiction (1994, 94% Tomatometer)I can’t get enough of Pulp Fiction. I just love it; it still holds up. And it didn’t win Best Picture, by the way. Didn’t win. Speaking of crazy…Sid and Nancy (1986,90% Tomatometer)So many things don’t win [Oscars]. Oh my God. Gary Oldman, Sid and Nancy — not nominated! And how about her? What’s her name? Chloe Webb. Oh my God, what a performance. Throw Sid and Nancy on there; I love that movie.Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968, 59% Tomatometer)I owe you one more? Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. How come they never remade that film? It’s a crime.Catch Timothy Olyphant in The Crazies, in theaters Friday.For more Five Favorite Films,visit our archive.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Ovation, 99%, Pictures, Globe, watch, Biopics, killer, crossover, the, documentaries","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Timothy-Olyphant"},{"id":"47508859035046","title":"Five Favorite Films with Roland Emmerich","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Roland EmmerichThe director of 2012 reveals his inspirations.by Alex Vo | November 10, 2009 |  CommentsWe’re fairly certain Roland Emmerich’s movies hold the record for combined body count.Such a feat is the result of a career built around movies like Independence Day,Godzilla, and The Day After Tomorrow, bombastic, crowd-pleasing disaster movies that frequently leavethe planet in ruins. His latest effort is 2012, opening this Friday and starring John Cusack, Amanda Peet, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as survivors in a world tearing apart at the seams and submerging in water. Rotten Tomatoes spoke to Emmerich to get his Five Favorite Films, and on the following page you can read our interview, where he discusses the upcoming 2012 television show, his thoughts onAvatar, and creating popcorn movies on a global scale.Lawrence of Arabia (1962,98% Tomatometer)It has the most incredible images. The only movie [from] the 60s that you can look at today and [have] it feel totally modern and real.Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977,95% Tomatometer)[Thematically,] it’s very much like my movies. Extraordinary tasks placed on regular people.Cinema Paradiso (1989,91% Tomatometer)Then, Cinema Paradiso, because it’s about a director and his dreams. Veryclose to my heart. It deals with just a kid who kind of falls in love with somebody in film, and film is also the relationship with a projectionist.Another one of my favorites is La nuit americaine by Truffaut. I kind of enjoy movies about movies. I’d never really wanted to become a director. I wanted to become a production designer. You know, certain movies had better production design than others, and that was driving me for the longest time.The Godfather (1972,100% Tomatometer)I have to say The Godfather. [Laughs] Incredible movie. The performances, how it’s told. That’s the longest opening scene in film history — an hour or so. The whole wedding, and then the movie starts.Citizen Kane (1941,100% Tomatometer)And then comes Citizen Kane. And that’s just how it’s put together, how it’s structured. It’s just a modern film. Sometimes I wish movies like this still get made. It’s just super radical in every aspect.Next, Emmerich talks about creating movies for a global audience, 3D movies, andhis thoughts on Avatar.Rotten Tomatoes: You’ve called yourself a “filmmaker for the masses” and whatdifferentiates your film from most other blockbuster directors is that you’vealso written nearly all your movies. So when you write the screenplay, who doyou want to satisfy first? Yourself or the audience?Roland Emmerich:Myself. I’m egoistic. [Laughs] It’s like, ifyou don’t write about what you’d like to see, I don’t think you can do anything.I think there are too many movies written, speculating with audiences, and Ithink the audiences feel that.RT: So you have faith then that what you’re interested in aligns withwhat audiences are interested in.SL: Yeah. But you learn a lot through the years and know alittle bit about what movies can be. And don’t forget, I’m a fan first. I watchmovies, I get excited. This year, when I saw District 9, I couldn’t stopthinking about it. And I was asking myself, “Isn’t it great that somebody inSouth Africa made a movie about South Africa, and it’s actually a sciencefiction movie about aliens?” It’s totally original, but it also serves theaudience’s needs. It’s just an incredible combination of very “out there” imagesand very traditional film storytelling techniques.RT: Can you see yourself returning to working on a scale that relativelysmall?SL: Well, my next movie’s [reportedly called Anonymous] relatively small. Well, you don’tcall under $30 million “relatively small,” but for me it is. I’m interested inthe subject matter, and I spent 8 years working on the script with the writer.It’s just the fact that you want to tell a certain story, and that’s been themain driving force of my career. I mean, I’m not saying, “Hello, I want to makea lot of money,” you know? I come from a relatively wealthy family. I don’t needmoney. [Laughs][rtimage]MapID=1205696&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: You wrote 2012 and 10,000 B.C. with Harald Kloser. What’s uniqueabout Kloser is that he’s a composer. How did this relationship develop?SL: I met him as a friend. He was friends with my sister, andwe sort of became friends. We’ve known each other forever. And yeah, I was awarethat he was a composer, and heard some music and it was really, really good. Butwhen I’m friends with somebody, I don’t want to work with them. The friendshipis more important than to work with someone.Over the years, we just kept talking and talking, and I realized he’s a totalstoryteller. From the first time I used him as a composer (The Day AfterTomorrow), I was amazed at how many notes I got from him, about the cut, aboutwhat he would make different in the cut. And we said, “Let’s write somethingtogether.”RT: Does he bring something to the process that is unique to the mind ofa composer, in how a scene is written or visualized?SL: He taught me the lesson that if it’s not lived, if you donot live something, you cannot write it. In a way, I was already applying it tomany of my movies, but [this made me] realize why some are better, why some arenot so good. It’s just one of these things where you realize all of a sudden,“Ah, that’s why it is.”So we wrote 10,000 B.C. That was meant to be a movie in a foreign language. Ithink we made a lot of compromises we shouldn’t have, so said, “Okay, next time,we don’t do any compromises.” And that’s 2012.RT: How did the “no compromises” position go down when making 2012?SL: I tend to like to option a script, and when you option ascript. When [a studio] wants [to work on the movie, too, you can pretty muchdictate the way it’s done. So everything has to be approved, and then you makethe movie. Sony loved 2012, they loved the script – that’s why they got it – andthey were very super-supportive. I mean, it’s very rare that I give kudos to astudio, but in this case I have to. They were terrific.[rtimage]MapID=1205696&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=20&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: As someone making movies for a wide audience, it’s hard to ignore 3Dfilmmaking. When youpreviously talked to Rotten Tomatoes, you said you weren’tsold on 3D. Because of the technology or because you think it’s a fad?SL: I can only speak for myself, Roland Emmerich. In a movietheater, the 3D effect just takes me out of the story. I just get a headacheafter 45 minutes, an hour. And I feel like, “What does that really add?” Ialways ask people, “So what does it add?” What does the third dimension reallyadd to the story? More depth? Anything?RT: The argument is that it increases audience participation with themovie.SL: I’d say it doesn’t do that at all. Movie theaters are aboutthe interaction of the audience, with the film and with the [rest of the]audience. When you have glasses on, you don’t turn to your neighbor and say,“Hey, that was great.” Somebody should make a study of the noise level in a 3Dmovie compared to a 2D movie. The audiences in 3D movies are awfully silent.[rtimage]MapID=1205696&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: Are you looking forward to Avatar?SL: I’m actually looking forward to that. [I might] have usesfor a lot of the technology that [James Cameron] developed and Bob Zemeckisdeveloped, [but] I’m not quite sure. I saw a lot of Zemeckis’s stuff but I’m notsure that’s the future. I’m now kind of curious about the camera. Maybe there’sa whole other way altogether to do it.RT: So you’re keeping the idea of 3D open.SL: Yeah. And you know what? If a studio finances one of mymovies and asks for 3D, you know, fine by me. They can give me the extra $20-$30million. But, still, I will always cut in 2D.RT: Was 2012 always conceived to continue on as a TV show?SL: No. That idea kind of came while we were shooting themovie. We just found it so fascinating to think about what would happen afterthis.I’m kind of running around the world right now promoting the movie, and I’m notso sure what they’re cooking up. I’ve only had a couple of initial meetingswhere we came up with the story. I haven’t even really had the chance to talkwith them since it was sold. There was no time.RT: Do you have a title for it yet?SL: We’ll just call it 2013, and then the next season it’ll be2014. [Laughs]Catch Roland Emmerich’s 2012 in theaters thisFriday.

Reitman burst onto the big screen in 2004 with a critically acclaimed satire, Thank You for Smoking, then followed that up in 2007 with the quirky, indie comedy Juno. The latter went on to win various awards, including the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for newcomer Diablo Cody’s pop-slang heavy script, and jumpstarted the career of its star, Ellen Page.This week, Reitman’s latest effort, the George Clooney-powered Up in the Air, opens in limited release, and we were lucky enough to sit down with Jason for a friendly chat about his Five Favorite Films and his personal Tomatometer.&nbsp;Election (1999,93% Tomatometer)Election inspired my voice as a director more than any other film I’ve ever seen. When I think about the perfect balance between comedy and drama on each of my films, the standard that I hold myself to is Election.Dr. Strangelove (1964,100% Tomatometer)It was my introduction to dark humour. I don’t think I knew what dark comedy was until I saw Dr. Strangelove.Harold and Maude (1971,84% Tomatometer)It’s the cinematic definition of charm. We can all only aspire to find love like Harold and Maude.Alien/Aliens (1979,97% Tomatometer/1986, 100% Tomatometer)Alien is a perfect film and if I were to ever make a sci-fi or horror film, the benchmark for me would be Alien. I would put Alien and Aliens side-by-side, actually. I think Alien 3 is mediocre and I think Alien: Resurrection is a travesty. AvP is fun. Whoever wins, we lose, you know — why not? I would love to see a return to greatness for that franchise. Knowing that David Fincher was given a chance, it’s actually kind of confusing. I think with better writers Alien 3 would be measuring up, because obviously he is as quality a director as Scott or Cameron. Jeunet is a brilliant director too, but just not right for that series.Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (1986,80% Tomatometer)I like to write movies about people who can talk. That’s kind of a defining characteristic of my films. People who are unusually convincing and who do not lose their cool. If I could be reborn the coolest guy alive, I would be reborn Ferris Bueller.Next, Reitman muses about his personal Tomatometer and how his films have performed on RT.RT: With your third movie, it’s starting to become clearer the sort of stories you like to tell…Jason Reitman: And I’m growing a patch of tomatoes. I love it.That’s true. We’re running out of awards to give you. If you could just make one bad film, that’d really help us.[laughs] That’d be useful? You mean you don’t send people trophies for the really bad ones?! By the way, Jennifer’s Body really f***ed up my curve — I was a producer. When you click on me, you count that in my sh**. It brought my numbers down. I was kind of upset by that! Up in the Air is like 95% [at the time of the interview], Juno is 93%, Smoking is 85% or 86%. My director numbers are strong.[rtimage]MapID=1208137&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]As a producer, not so much.[laughs] Well, I produced Up in the Air, too! I’m like a 75% overall.Do you keep an eye on your Tomatometer, then?Oh, absolutely. I’m always very aware of my Tomato rating. I’m a numbers guy. You know about my pie chart? I like numbers. My math SAT – through the roof. My English SAT – in the toilet. I’ve always been into numbers and that’s one of the reasons I like Kubrick – he was obsessed by numbers. The only way of measuring the culmination of your reviews is Rotten Tomatoes. Even though I decide for myself if I’m going to see a movie, it’s nice to go on there and see, “How is this going to fare?”You can catch Jason Reitman’s newest film, Up in the Air, in theaters beginning this weekend.For more Five Favorite Films,visit our archive.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"singing, One, stand-up, Travel, The, SundanceTV, harry, TV, cults, Marvel, disaster, movies, See","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/JasonReitman.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-jason-reitman"},{"id":"47508860582323","title":"Five Favorite Films with Sienna Miller","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Sienna MillerStar of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra talks about shifting genres, theater vs. film, and My Little Ponies.by Ryan Fujitani | August 5, 2009 |  CommentsBefore she made the leap to film, American-born British actress Sienna Miller was a successful model and sometime stage thespian. Once she found her footing on the big screen, however, she went on to play roles opposite established and up-and-coming actors such as Daniel Craig, Jude Law, Heath Ledger, James Franco, and Steve Buscemi. While her career has remained decidedly within the realm of smaller, independent cinema, she makes an explosive debut this weekend as the formidable Baroness in Stephen Sommers’ blockbuster Summer actioner, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Speaking to RT from New York where she was wrapping up two weeks of press for the film, Miller briefly gave us her Five Favorite Films and went on to talk about the progression of her career, the differences between acting in theater and on film, and what it was like doing a huge action film after so many arthouse roles.All About Eve (1950,100% Tomatometer)All About Eve. Bette Davis is just extraordinary in that film. I can’t really give more insight; it’s just an incredible movie and, I think, incredibly evolved for its time. I think with any good performance, it’s inspirational in some way. I just think it’s an amazing movie. You know, it’s hard for movies to last, and there’s something really timeless about that story and the performances. There’s something really modern about — and really antiquated as well — but it’s just, I think, a really powerful film and performance.Once Upon a Time in the West (1969,98% Tomatometer)The opening is second to none. And the music, and everything about that film, I think is superb.My Life as a Dog (1987,100% Tomatometer)I think it’s just touching and heartfelt and really poignant. I just remember when I first watched it, it stayed with me and it’s kind of never left. These are all quite artsy, aren’t they?October (Ten Days That Shook the World) (1927,86% Tomatometer)Eisenstein’s October. Because it was obviously groundbreaking, and, you know, it’s not something I would sit down on a Sunday afternoon and watch, but as a piece of filmmaking in its time, it’s revolutionary.Some Like It Hot (1959,97% Tomatometer)I should do something that’s a little more contemporary, maybe. Some Like It Hot. Marilyn Monroe in that film was one of my first memories of film. That’s why I love it. I remember watching it when I was really young and singing along.Well, those are really artistic choices, but I also love modern films. I love Chaplin films, and I love French films… But off the top of my head, those are the five. It’s quite a pretentious list in hindsight. [laughs] I mean, they’re not my favorites; I could go on for ten hours. That was just off the top of my head. But I’ve never been good with favorites.Next, Miller talks about her theater experiences and what it was like working on a big budget action film for a change.RT: You seem to be somewhat of a cinephile. Is it something you were interested in from a young age?Sienna Miller: Yeah, definitely. I think as… God, everything sound pretentious! I’m sorry, I was about to go on about the “medium of film.” Oh God, I can’t stand the sound of my own voice, sorry. [laughs] Two and a half weeks of junkets — I’m so sick of myself! But I mean, yeah, obviously, it has been. That’s why I chose to do what I do. I love film.And did you have in mind that you wanted to be an actor from that early age as well?SM: I did. I don’t really remember why, but I always knew that was what I wanted to do. I did a lot of theater in school, and directed plays in school. I think, coming from England, it’s so much a part of our culture, so my first passion was probably theater. Just seeing adults whose job it was to play professionally really appealed to me. And I know I’ve kind of hopped between genres — well, I’ve predominantly done more arthouse independent films, but I’m doing a play on Broadway this fall, and that’s really exciting.How do you enjoy stage work compared with film work?SM: I think it’s pretty hard to compare the two because they’re so different. I love the collaborative nature of both. I love the idea that you’re there to create something artistic. But there’s something about doing live theater, with the adrenaline that comes with it, that is really second to none. But I don’t think that film is any easier in any way. I know that sometimes people perceive it to be an easier medium, but I don’t feel that way. I think you can work harder on a film than on a play; it’s just a very different thing.[rtimage]MapID=1183218&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Speaking of stage vs. film, for example when you worked with Steve Buscemi on Interview, that seemed very much like a piece that could have been performed as a play as well.SM: Yeah, we actually talked about that when we were doing it. It would make an amazing play, and I’d love to do it. It was such a great script, and such a cool idea. And he’s a genius, obviously. And the way that we shot it, we shot the whole movie in nine nights, and it was thirty pages of dialogue a night. Eight-minute takes, and no blocking, because we had three handheld cameras. There were no marks or anything like that. So in many respects it felt like doing a play. But it would really translate well to the stage. I should talk to him about that. I’d love to do it.As you mentioned earlier, you’ve mostly focused on smaller, independent arthouse films, and now you’re in G.I. Joe, and it’s this big budget, expansive, epic film. How does that experience compare with your previous roles?SM: It was completely different, obviously. In scale and energy. It was initially really intimidating and overwhelming, just from being with a crew of 150 to a crew of a thousand, where every day you see somebody new. You know, it’s not as intimate in any way, and it’s also not as indulgent, when it comes to your own performance. It’s often more about what’s going on around you than what you’re actually doing, which is great. I kind of wanted just to see what it was like, and to do something completely different and get in shape for the first time in my life, and learn how to fight. I wanted to do something that was purely entertainment and not emotionally indulgent in any way. It seems like these are the movies that people want to see, that a lot of people want to see. Yeah, I just thought it would be something different. My nephew was begging me to do it so… [laughs] It’s very hard to say no to a beautiful five-year-old boy.But it was fun! It was just pure fun in every way, as you would expect. Physcially kind of quite tiring at times, sprinting uphill for eight hours and stuff like that. But no, it’s not brain surgery, we’re not, you know… It was really funny, and Stephen’s [Sommers] got this natural manic ebullience that infects everyone around him, and we laughed a lot. You know, cool costumes, firing guns… It was just really fun. And we all loved each other, which helps.[rtimage]MapID=1193682&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=25&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]It’s interesting that you wanted to do something more emotionally detached, and yet your character in G.I. Joe is probably one of the more complex ones, if that can be said, in the movie.SM: That’s simply my own habit. I drag it with me from past experience. [laughs] Well no, I mean, she’s definitely got some kind of emotional conflict going on, but it wasn’t something that I… You know, I didn’t spend months researching, or being at all “method” about it, because that didn’t really fit the piece. And yeah, she’s definitely a character, and that was fun. But I think in anything that I did, I would want to have some kind of emotional layer. Even though people are more interested in explosions, probably, than that. [laughs] The audience for G.I. Joe isn’t really going to pay too much attention to that.Were you familiar at all with the G.I. Joe franchise?SM: I was really ignorant. Well, in England, first of all, it was called Action Man, and I actually thought G.I. Joe was a G.I. called Joe. [laughs] I probably shouldn’t admit that, but no. Obviously, subsequent to reading the script and accepting the role, I researched it further. And I hope we haven’t alienated any of the original fans. I’ve had a lot of grown men coming up to me and going, “This is my childhood, man, don’t mess with it.” And I’ve sort of said, “I’m making a film, not messing with childhoods.” It obviously means a lot if the fans respond well. But you know, I was a girl, I still am. I was more into Barbies and My Little Pony than G.I. Joe.My Little Ponies. I remember my sister had a few of those…SM: You lie. You had them.I did not have them. Well, maybe the one with the extended tail that you could brush.SM: [laughs] That sounds really wrong. Extended tail…[rtimage]MapID=1193682&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=37&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]So since you’ve done this big budget action film, and you’ve done the indie circuit as well, working across several genres, do you have a favorite?SM:: That’s hard. It really depends on the role. I think, as an actress, I really like pushing myself emotionally. I love that challenge of kind of inhabiting a role. I suppose independent arthouse films maybe call for that more, but that’s probably because I haven’t done big mainstream films that required it. I haven’t had that opportunity, but I’m sure that would be great. Ultimately, you know, I love my job, and I love being able to do different things, and I think that’s a really lucky position to be in. So I don’t know whether I could pick a favorite. I think what I like is hopping between different things. Like going and doing a play after GI Joe, you know what I mean? I think I’d get bored if I was just doing one. It all feels the same; I don’t change my style of acting, necessarily. Depending on what I’m doing, it’s all kind of getting together to create something that I like, the collaborative nature of it.If G.I. Joe does well, then I’ll do the second, so I feel like I have my action niche probably covered. And I’d like to probably do something more arthouse. But it totally depends on what happens after the play, you know. Maybe we transfer that to London, depending on its success. You know, I’m pretty spontaneous. I think I probably want to do something maybe smaller, but if I got some great offer, then I don’t know. It depends.G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra opens nationwide this weekend.

The film which earned him his “From the director of…” title card, The Football Factory, is nothing if not violent, loud and not particularly critically well-loved. His follow-up, The Business, recasts Danny Dyer and sets itself in the Costa Del Crime world of 80s Spain and had a similarly rocky reception with reviewers. And yet he’s one of Britain’s better-known directors, suggesting he talks to an active audience of cinemagoers.With The Firm, Love revisits themes present in both films — the 80s and football-fan violence — but has more in common with his lesser-seen debut feature, coming-of-age comedy Goodbye Charlie Bright. Early notices have been warmer than Love tends to receive from critics, with Empire declaring the film, “intense, exciting and impressive.”RT caught up with Love to rundown his favourite films and chat about the flick.Click on a thumbnail below.The FirmMidnight CowboyPlanes, Trains…The King of ComedyHeatThe Firm“Clearly we’ll start here. I hope it’s fairly obvious, my adoration of it, but I think that what it represents is probably bigger than the actual film itself. It was the first film I’d ever seen that was really something I could identify with, so it has a big place in my heart and my mind. But actually, the more you went back and looked at The Firm, the more you could pick very small holes in it, you know. Whereas, obviously, I could talk about The Godfather, but there’s nothing you could find wrong with that — it’s a true masterpiece. What was amazing about the original Firm was Gary Oldman, and the brutality and the Steadicam and stuff like that. Because it was the first film that ever really affected me, it’s always going to have a place in my heart.”Click on a thumbnail below.The FirmMidnight CowboyPlanes, Trains…The King of ComedyHeatMidnight Cowboy“What touched me about that was the friendship. In a very weird sort of way there are some similarities between my films — probably pretty-much The Firm — and Midnight Cowboy, only inasmuch as it’s a hard world but soft characters. There’s something about that friendship with two people that transcends where the film’s set. I have friendships where you’re like two old women, nagging away at each other, and you kind of hate each other in a lot of ways but you’re inextricably embroiled with one another. That’s what true friendship is, you know. There’s such a tragedy about Midnight Cowboy as well and there’s such an amazing smell of New York in the 70s. It’s one of the few films where it transports you there and you can feel the environment.”Click on a thumbnail below.The FirmMidnight CowboyPlanes, Trains…The King of ComedyHeatPlanes, Trains and Automobiles“It’s such a leftfield film for someone like me, but what is has is a very clear plot and it has two people trapped together inextricably. But what it does so well is that you laugh, you feel embarrassed, and then at the end — I cry my eyes out at the end of that film. Even thinking about it makes me upset. When Steve Martin is on the tube and John Candy gets off and he’s standing with his bag and he realises there is no one. It’s just such a beautiful thing. You can clearly see from Midnight Cowboy and Planes, Trains that there’s a pattern with me, and it’s really about loving other men – in a non-sexual way. It’s such a big thing for me — I value my friendships with my male friends. I’ve got a fiancé as well, and she’s certainly part of the action, but it’s a very different thing and you can’t get the same sort of friendship with a woman that you can with a man. And interestingly the filmmaking in Planes, Trains isn’t great. It looks so bad, it’s really televisual, but it’s got massive heart. ”Click on a thumbnail below.The FirmMidnight CowboyPlanes, Trains…The King of ComedyHeatThe King of Comedy“You know what, I think I’m going to swerve The Godfather and go for The King of Comedy. I love Scorsese – I loved Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets — they were all really seminal, but I always like a film which is, if not leftfield it’s not obvious Scorsese. He has made less obvious films, like New York, New York or The Last Waltz, which don’t hit the mark for me, but King of Comedy is a gem I think. Curiously enough I was talking about it to my fiancé at the weekend, saying, ‘You’ve got to see it,’ because I think it’s where we are now as a contemporary celebrity-seeking society. There are Rupert Pupkins everywhere now. What they don’t have, that Rupert Pupkin had, is innocence and naivety. When you see the whole Big Brother world, the way that people are cloying to get famous now, that’s Rupert Pupkin. I remember when I first watched The Office I saw a lot of Rupert Pupkin in David Brent. Rupert Pupkin had such likeability whereas Brent is a toad – you want to watch him fail. With Pupkin you want to say, ‘Don’t do it. Don’t go to Jerry Lewis‘ house. Don’t tell Diahnne Abbott you know him — you don’t!'”Click on a thumbnail below.The FirmMidnight CowboyPlanes, Trains…The King of ComedyHeatHeat“It’s a toss-up because I love The Insider and, actually, Miami Vice as well. I’m going for Heat because, for me, when you’re really getting into a film is when you start imitating the characters and repeating lines and all that. I never really did that with Sonny Corleone but I did fantasise and think, God, how cool is Neil McCauley in Heat? It’s one of those movies that blew everyone away. In the mid-90s it was a very tired time, you know — a lot of the 80s panache had gone out of the movies and the early 90s was a period for me where I was discovering people like Almodovar. I was just bored of American films. Heat came out of nowhere. It was so muscular, so brooding and so clinically cool. Actually it’s long — it could have done with 20 minutes cut out of it I imagine — but that’s Michael Mann‘s condition. I haven’t seen Public Enemies — there was just something about it that stopped me, which is strange for me when it comes to Michael Mann. I went to see Vice the day it came out, first performance on the Friday. I was mesmerised by it. But Heat was such a powerhouse of a film. Even though I’ve inhabited the wrong side of the tracks in my life, I believe I’m still a good boy, a moral boy, but of course everyone roots for the bad guy in that film. DeNiro is just too fucking cool.”Click on a thumbnail below.The FirmMidnight CowboyPlanes, Trains…The King of ComedyHeat[tomatometer]MuzeID=10011720[/tomatometer]The Firm feels like a real step up for you.Nick Love: I do think I’m understanding storytelling a bit better. How you don’t necessarily need to be blitzing people with loud noises, and machine gun fire and music. There’s a fair bit of music in The Firm, but there are lots of quiet periods in the film too. As you get more confident as a filmmaker you trust that more and you understand that two blokes sitting on a wall or standing on a balcony — you can hold that stuff.The characters are a bit more relatable this time around. Calum McNab‘s character, he’s a lovely guy who just takes a wrong turn when he meets Bex.NL: The thing is, I think whether you come from a country estate or a council estate, everyone can relate to adolescence. These characters, they’re not so despicable, they have a bit of charm and they can transcend class. [McNab’s character] Dom and his friends at the start of the film, they’re just boys, bickering and having fun and innocent. One of the things I wanted to do was that with the original film — it’s a brilliant film and one of my favourites — but I wanted to turn everything on its head. He came from a really lovely family — the mum and the dad, you really wanted to spend more time with them. You never really got enough of them in the film. And his friends were really nice. OK they were a bit divvy or whatever, but they were nice.And rather than make it really social realism like he comes from a Bernados’ home, it’s more that he’s got everything right, so actually when he does start knocking about with Bex, if you didn’t understand the excitement of that then you’d really think, You’re a fucking idiot. You don’t think that until the end because there’s such a colour with The Firm, and they’re not all nasty boys. In the end, certainly, but in the beginning Dom thinks he’s cool. And so Jay’s cool and Trigger’s cool. They’re the top boys, and they’re fun. When they’re on the train to Portsmouth and they celebrate the train inspector rather than turn on him, that’s the world Dom sees.There’ve been a lot of films about football hooliganism that don’t show the attractive side of that world, and actually once you’ve seen the attraction you really feel the punches.NL: For me, there’s a narrative in the fights. You have to understand that Dom is getting bloodied at Portsmouth, and that’s about the thrill of it. It’s about being there, and it’s about the moment. And saying you were there. When they get run by Millwall, it’s all about Dom seeing it for what it is — the ugly side of it. The fight at the end, that’s Dom realising that he can’t go through with it. If you lose the narrative it’s just mindless action — there’s no emotional investment in it.Bex (Paul Anderson, right) threatens Dom (Calum McNab)How did you find Calum?NL: He was in The Football Factory. He was in it for about five minutes. He came in for an extra part and the guy who was going to play this small part dropped out. He had a good face, and I said do you, ‘Look, do you mind doing it?’ I had the camera in front of him, and I remember I went, ‘Are you ready?’ He said, ‘I was fucking born ready, mate.’ I was a bit disarmed by his confidence. I remembered him when I was thinking about this, just because of what he’d said. With Dom, the big thing always — and I felt it could have been a big search trying to find this guy — was that it had to be someone who you’d believe was innocent, but you’d also believe could go on this journey. Most actors can either do tough or fey, but to find someone who could knit that together I knew would be tough. What made it for me was screen testing him together with Paul Anderson playing Bex. They were really comfortable with each other. I thought if all else fails, if you believed in the two of them, you’d take something away from the film.Bex is a similar character, in that you see from the off that he’s a terrible person and yet you have to see an attractive side to him too.NL: Yeah, you see what he’s about at the beginning, but what’s great about Paul is that he played it, in a way, quite camp. It’s just those little beats that give you accessibility. If he was too cool for school, he’d be quite cold. Interestingly, Gary Oldman was quite camp in the original, although we stayed away from mimicking him. He puts on a lot of panto voices. It’s a very good way of seeing a feminine side, and if you’re seeing a feminine side you’re seeing a rounded side.You do seem to have a love affair with the 80s — the film revels in period detail.NL: The original genesis of the film was that it was going to be a straight remake, and Bex was going to be working for Foxton’s estate agents. He was going to go around in one of those fucking awful minis and it was going to be a modern-day Fight Club. It was only when I thought about telling the story from Dom’s point of view that I thought about making the film about casuals and how it would be if I set it earlier than the original rather than later. Then I started to get quite free with it, and it became more about honouring the original but making my own film. There’s a lot of me in Dom, someone who was always terrified of violence but attracted to the core.The Firm is out in the UK on Friday.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"cancelled, Best, New, comedies, Peacock, strong, Mindy, streaming, Trivia, indie, facebook, visit, Chernobyl, Horror","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/NickLove.jpg","slug":"five-favourite-films-with-nick-love"},{"id":"47508862204343","title":"Five Favorite Films with Robert Rodriguez","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Robert RodriguezThe director of Sin City and Spy Kids talks about his new film, Shorts, and his son's influences on the process.by Jen Yamato | July 25, 2009 |  CommentsRobert Rodriguez is known as Hollywood’s DIY filmmaker, having “shot, chopped, and scored” his own films from El Mariachi to his 2007 collaboration with Quentin Tarantino, Planet Terror. This August, he’ll blaze another trail — movie making as family bonding project — with the kid flick Shorts, which Rodriguez conceived largely in collaboration with his own children. We met the soft-spoken auteur in a secluded room hidden within the San Diego Convention Center to talk about his favorite films and learn more about how the imaginations of his son led to his most family-friendly film since Spy Kids 3-D and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lava Girl.Jaws (1975,100% Tomatometer)Jaws, because I just showed it to my kids for the first time. They’d seen snippets, but that’s the first time I said, “Okay, you guys are old enough. Gotta bite the bullet; we’re going to watch the damn thing all together.” My son, my ten-year-old, was like… So I watched it when I was seven because it was released on my birthday in 1975. June 20th, 1975, Jaws came out, and that was my birthday present. He was like — with the sheets — doing this [mimics pulling covers over head] over his head, and I was like, “What are you doing?” He said, “I’m practicing to make sure they go up high enough.” [laughs] So we watched that. They loved that, and they were like, “What else can we watch?”The Godfather (1972,100% Tomatometer)The Godfather, because it’s about family. It’s just a perfect film. Five-act structure… It’s just amazing. Coppola just did the coolest stuff with that.Blade Runner (1982,91% Tomatometer)Blade Runner is also one of my favorites. I love film noir movies, and that was just a new way of doing it. Set in the future, made up worlds. It’s just a straight up great movie; everything fell into place, which is just rare for things to happen that way. How everything came together, the artistry that went into it, the design, the music, and how resilient the story is, how you can just keep making new versions of it, and they all still kind of work. [laughs] When you can just keep remaking the same movie with the same footage and just kind of tweak it a little bit…Notorious (1946,97% Tomatometer)Notorious, the Hitchcock movie. Between that and Strangers on a Train, I think Notorious, because it’s just… I just dig that one.Escape from New York (1981,81% Tomatometer)Escape From New York, because that’s the one that made me want to make movies. It was a fantasy world. It was like, “What? There’s a wall around New York? It’s a prison? You can do that? You can just make stuff like that up?” That’s a lot of freedom; I thought that was very freeing. I was twelve when I saw that, twelve or thirteen. And I saw that [John Carpenter] wrote it, directed it, and did the music, and I was just like, “This guy’s doing everything. You can do that?” It just felt like, it was so renegade. It was independently done, and it made me want to start making movies, and I started making movies from that point on. It was just very inspiring. I knew I had a lot of interest, and that made me… That was movie that just really marked my life.Next, Rodriguez talks about his upcoming kid flick Shorts and what it’s like to draw inspiration from his own children.RT: If you could talk about Shorts. I find it fascinating that, in your career, you’ve made more adult entertainment, but have also enriched children’s films.Robert Rodriguez: I just started, actually — when I first started out — making action-type movies in my back yard, but also family comedies, because I have ten brothers and sisters. So I would make Little Rascal-type movies, short films, and enter them in contests, and they would win. None of the other short films were made with children doing action and comedy, and people were just laughing. There was such a great reaction that they would vote for my movies and they would win. I would hear it; I would go, and you would hear the movies, and they would play very quietly, but ours would come up, and you couldn’t hear the movie because people would laugh so much and clap so much. It was just nonstop. Really fast-paced, one joke after another, and visual, and kids… Hello, what a winning formula! [laughs] So later, once El Mariachi hit, I told the studios, “I also want to do a really good family film, because nobody’s really doing those.” You know, with live action, with kids, imaginative, based on my experiences growing up in a family with ten kids, because a lot of it was based on my family.Now that I have five kids of my own, we come up with stuff all the time. While I’m making these other movies, I get these other ideas, and I go back to making family films, because I have some ideas for them. I think, “That’d be a lot of fun.” It helps exercise a different muscle and a different creativity and figuring out storytelling in a different way. Helps to expand your horizons a little bit. I mean, I haven’t gone that far and done a romantic comedy; my idea of a romantic screwball comedy was Planet Terror, where you have the guy and the girl, ex-boyrfriend, ex-girlfriend… He’s pissed off because she has no leg, and they kind of banter back and forth, but they’re zombies, you know? [laughs] Kind of always have to throw that in, but that’s my romantic comedy.[rtimage]MapID=1198526&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]So Shorts. My son came up with that. He said, “I want to come up with the next family movie. My brother came up with the other one.” I said, “Well, when do you want to do it? Have at it. What’s your idea?” And he said, “Something like The Little Rascals.” I said, “Of course! That’s all I used to do, is short films! This would be great if we made a bunch of shorts, and they can all be intertwined. Kind of like Pulp Fiction for kids.” And he came up with this great rainbow rock, so we decided to make it a wishing rock, and that would be the element that tied all the stories together. We just kind of developed the idea piece by piece, and we shot a fake trailer for it at home, and the studio showed it to Warner Bros. and they bought it. So I went and finished the script, shot the real movie there in Austin, and it’s just a lot of fun. It was one of those projects that just came out of “What if we did this?” and just kept growing and growing and growing and growing.RT: That sounds like a great family activity.RR: It is! You’re at dinnertime, going, “What if one kid wants to keep the rock away from the other kids, and they’re all surrounding him, and he’s holding it up, and he says, ‘I wish for really long arms,’ and his arms go really high up? And then the other girl’s crawling like a spider — she’s invisible — and she grabs it. She appears, and then she disappears… [laughs] She turns into a toaster.” If they laugh you write it down. If they don’t, you come up with something else.RT: Did any of the ideas in the movie for scenes or storylines come from your kids?RR: Oh yeah, a lot of them. My son came up with the rock, with the canyon, with the snakes — we have a bunch of snakes. My son kept saying, “Crocodile canyon.” Yeah, they would come up with stuff that I would write down and we’d keep sometimes. You need so many ideas in a movie like that, you’re like, “I’m taking that one, too.” [laughs] It’s all up for grabs.[rtimage]MapID=1198526&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: That’s great. It’s harnessing a child’s natural imagination.RR: Well, that, and also, it’s as close as you get to going back in a time machine and interviewing yourself at that age, of what you find entertaining. A lot of it is stuff we take for granted, and it’s basically empowerment. You know, if you want to go down the street, you can just get in a car and go; a kid can’t do that, so that’s why he would fantasize about being able to fly, or having a jet pack like in Spy Kids, or having a rock that they could just wish they could go anywhere or do anything or be anything. If you look at traditionally what movies are usually big with kids, empowerment is a big thing for them. Whether it’s Power Rangers or Spy Kids or Harry Potter or something like this, or Sharkboy and Lavagirl where, you know, he’s half boy and half shark. Little kids just eat that up. It’s like, yeah, they want to be strong, they want to have powers.RT: Speaking of Sharkboy, it just occurred to me that Sharkboy is now Twilight-boy.RR: Yeah, mm-hmm. [Taylor Lautner’s] great. You know, when he came in — he was the first kid who came in. I got it on video. He came in, he’s this athletic kid, does karate and stuff. I turned to my son, who wrote the idea — he was there in casting with me — I said, “What do you think of him as Sharkboy?” and he said, “Yup.” I was watching this again recently. He was only the first one that came in; I said, “You think that’s the one?” He said, “Yup.” [laughs] I said, “I think so, too. I don’t think we’ll do better than that.”RT: Obviously, you have this reputation for making awesome movies, and doing so many of the elements yourself.RR: It’s just fun. Like I said, I was inspired by that movie that made me think I could do those things. They’re just fun jobs. I just kept the jobs that I liked, and the other ones I gave to other people. But yeah, doing music and photography and editing and special effects and all that’s so much a part of the job for me.Look for Shorts, opening in August, and for more Five Favorite Films, check our archive.Get our latest Comic-Con 2009 updates here:Comic-Con Day 1 News TickerComic-Con Day 1 Wrap-upComic-Con Day 2 News TickerComic-Con Day 2 Wrap-upComic-Con Day 3 News TickerComic-Con Celebrity GalleryComic-Con Costume Gallery","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Star, Cannes, Ovation, APB, talk, History, high, CW, Black, adaptation, diversity, Box, NBC, Fox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/RobertRodriguez.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-robert-rodriguez"},{"id":"47508862202294","title":"Five Favorite Films With Rob Zombie","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films With Rob ZombieThe director of H2: Halloween 2 has love for Kubrick, Scorsese, and Peter Boyle.by Alex Vo | July 26, 2009 |  CommentsMetalhead-turned-director Rob Zombie has been on the fringes of American pop culture since his days with White Zombie, the rock band he made famous in the mid-1990s. After achieving commercial and critical success as a solo artist, he turned his talents toward the world of cinema, making his directorial debut with 2003’s House of 1000 Corpses. In 2007, he was offered the opportunity to helm the remake of the horror classic Halloween, bringing him further into the public eye. RT caught up with Rob at this year’s Comic-Con, where he was promoting his upcoming sequel , H2: Halloween 2, and he spoke to us about his Five Favorite Films, sharing some personal stories about his childhood and some insights into the filmmaking process along the way.&nbsp;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971,90% Tomatometer)In terms of mind-blowing experiences, I would say the first film was Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, just because I think — I’m pretty sure — that’s the first time I ever saw a live action movie in a movie theater as a kid. My dad took me and my brother to see it. I think up till then I’d only seen one animated movie in a movie theater. I think it was Robin Hood, which, for some reason, was really boring to me. But we went to see Willy Wonka, and I was so blown away, and it so freaked me out, that I couldn’t stop thinking about it for years. I had watched movies on TV and stuff, but that was the first time I think I was old enough to go to the movies, and be able to sit through a movie without wanting to get up and run around the theater. Just seeing it that big and getting sucked into it. I don’t even think I realized those were actors and that anything was fake. I think I just thought it was all real, that Charlie was a real kid, and Willy Wonka was a real person. I really think I thought it was real. I really thought the whole family lived in that one room. I was probably in second grade or something… So I probably didn’t actually think it was real, but I responded to it like it was real.Young Frankenstein (1974,93% Tomatometer)The next movie would probably be Young Frankenstein. I remember going to see that as a kid. Because I loved all the Universal horror films, but I had only seem them on TV, like on Creature Double Feature on Friday afternoons. By that point I loved Gene Wilder, because I made the connection like, “Oh, that guy was in Willy Wonka. Now he’s in Young Frankenstein.” So that movie blew me away. And even to this day, I watch it all the time. It’s such an incredible movie because it’s really, really funny, with such incredible performances, but it’s so beautifully made. Nobody would spend the time now to make a comedy that well. Visually and technically, it’s so incredible. It doesn’t date; it holds up. Peter Boyle’s perfect, and Madeline Kahn and Gene Wilder, and everybody. It’s just an incredible movie. It really captured the feel of those Universal films, like Bride of Frankenstein, yet it is really funny. It’s something that almost never works. You know, kind of look at the Munsters on TV, and the Addams family, where you could get into it and they have the art direction there and everyone’s funny, but it almost never works. It’s almost always a disaster, and that film is just so perfect. I think the fact that people were brave enough back then to release black-and-white movies.RT: You think horror-comedies are hard to do in general?RZ: Yeah, I think they never work. They’re either campy or stupid, and that one is neither. It’s just funny, the right, perfect tone. I don’t know, I think it’s a testament to how great Gene Wilder is. He’s just incredible, just unbelievable.A Clockwork Orange (1971,91% Tomatometer)Then I would say the next time I remember going and seeing a movie and having my mind f—ing blown was A Clockwork Orange. I was probably about 15 or so when I saw that. At that point in time there were no DVDs, there was no VHS. As a movie fanatic, I could only look at pictures and go, “Oh my god, A Clockwork Orange! I have to see this movie!” But how do you see it? It’s not playing anywhere. Eventually it was playing at a college, and I went to go see it at this college. I was only fifteen years old and it was all college people and they seemed real cool. And it just f—ing blew my mind. And ever since then I’ve been fanatic for Kubrick and Malcolm McDowell.That’s why I love working with Malcolm, because he loves talking about that stuff. You can ask him anything, and he’ll give you all the dirt on how… What is amazing for me too, hearing the stories about the movie, is just how much time they had. Now you have, “Oh, you have an hour to shoot that thing.” And he’ll go, “Oh, we shot that in five days.” That Singing in the Rain scene. They didn’t even figure out the song until eventually he said that Kubrick was like, “Do you know any songs?” And when Stanley would be at a loss for what to do, he would go up to Malcolm and go, “You’re probably going to be sick tomorrow. You won’t be able to make it to work for probably about a week.” And they would shut down and Malcolm would pretend to be sick so Stanley could figure out what he was going to shoot next.RT: You think that was the standard back then, or do you think that was a luxury Kubrick was…RZ: I mean, I’ve read so many books on Kubrick; I think he just worked outside the system. They just let him get away with f—ing murder.RT: Would you prefer to have that much time, or do you think there’s something to be captured when you’re shooting quick?RZ: I think it’s both. I just want to have enough time for what we need to do. You can have too much time, and too much money’s wasted. You see that in so many blockbuster movies, where they had everything at their disposal and they came up with nothing. You know, you’d like to go, “Okay, we’ve got two hours to shoot this; we really need four hours or five.” But you’re not always sacrificing, because you know on set, you know when you walk away from a scene and you go, “We have that scene nailed.” And then you get to editing, whatever, seven months later, comes together perfectly. And with other scenes you shoot, you go, “I know we don’t have that scene. I just know it’s not there.” And then you get to editing, and you spend forever trying to make something work, but you just know, because it never really got on film in the first place. And I would just like to have the luxury to be able to go, “Okay, I know we have it. Now let’s move on.” I don’t know that I ever completely feel that way, but I would like to feel that way a little more often.Taxi Driver (1976,100% Tomatometer)I would say Taxi Driver. First time I saw Taxi Driver as a kid, it f—in’ blew my mind. I’ve always been a huge fan of movies about solitary, sort of loner people. I think that’s what I liked about horror movies as a kid, because the monsters were always portrayed that way. And Taxi Driver‘s obviously the ultimate movie about that. I don’t know. I’m picking very obvious movies that are genius, but they were new to me as a kid when I saw them, and they just made me go, “Oh my god, the genius of movies.” I love Taxi Driver so much; I’ve seen it so many times. It’s probably one of those movies where I could recite the whole movie straight, or I could at one point; I probably can’t any more. But when I moved to New York — I lived in New York in the early 1980s — and I literally went to every location that was in Taxi Driver, and it was all still there: the porno theater, Variety photo place where Jodie Foster runs in front of Travis’ cab, the furnished rooms building where Harvey Keitel’s standing. I actually had a friend who lived in that building, so that was even more exciting. I used to be a maniac; I went everywhere. It was like my walking tour of Taxi Driver, New York. And again, I was like, “It’s Peter Boyle as the Wizard! This is the greatest movie ever made!” I remember seeing Peter Boyle at the Beverly Center once, and I freaked out. It’s like, “Who do you get excited to meet?” “Peter Boyle!”The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974, 90% Tomatometer)And then I’d probably say, to round it out, probably The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. First time going to see that — I remember going to see that. Or Rocky Horror Picture Show, we can make those tied. Finally when I got some wheels and could drive out of town, I would drive for hours and days to go see a movie. I would go to great lengths to see movies. One time I rode my bicycle for seven hours just to see Night of the Living Dead. I did it in the rain, like, “I’m going to see this f—ing movie if it’s the last thing I do!”RT: How would you hear about how they’re playing?RZ: Sometimes I’d see an ad in the paper. I remember one time, me and my friend were driving and we heard, “One night only! Andy Warhol’s Frankenstein, 3D!” [mimics sound of car peeling out] We spun the car around, drove back the other direction like four hours. We were just fanatics. We’d go to any lengths to see anything. I saw Chainsaw in a double feature with this Jimi Hendrix movie, Jimi Plays Berkeley. It was when I first moved to New York. Everything was a double feature, and it was always weird movies together. I remember again going, “This is the greatest movie ever made.” Everybody was f—ed up, deranged. I don’t know, those are movies that shake my worldview. I would just get so sucked into the movie, I’d never want it to end, and I think Chainsaw Massacre, first time I saw it, I don’t think I’d ever seen a movie like that before. The way it was just so gritty and gnarly. Now you see it all the time – it was so influential — but when I saw it then, that was like 25 years ago or something.Look for H2: Halloween 2, opening in August, and for more Five Favorite Films, check our archive.Get our latest Comic-Con 2009 updates here:Comic-Con Day 1 News TickerComic-Con Day 1 Wrap-upComic-Con Day 2 News TickerComic-Con Day 2 Wrap-upComic-Con Day 3 News TickerComic-Con Day 3 Wrap-upComic-Con Celebrity GalleryComic-Con Costume Gallery","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"CW, obituary, 24, bad, science, on, spinoff, drama, Reviews, historical, crime, franchise, spanish, Comedy, New","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/RobZombie.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-rob-zombie"},{"id":"47508862228929","title":"Five Favorite Films with Antonio Banderas","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Antonio BanderasThe star of this week's The Code talks Fellini, Rob Marshall's Nine, direct-to-video movies and more.by Jen Yamato | June 22, 2009 |  CommentsWhile contemporary audiences might know him best as the swashbuckling Zorro, the gun-toting El Mariachi, or the voice of Shrek‘s furry friend, Puss in Boots (who’s set to get his own spin-off film in 2012), Spanish native and Hollywood veteran Antonio Banderas got his start in the audacious films of art-house darling Pedro Almodovar (including Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, Matador, and Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown). Naturally, we were dying to see if Banderas’ favorite films were as varied, and as controversial, as the movies in which he’s starred — and we weren’t disappointed.We were also curious to address a pricklier subject regarding movies and the artists who make them, no matter their audience. This week, Banderas, Morgan Freeman, and director Mimi Leder attempt to subvert a popular way of thinking in Hollywood with their heist thriller, The Code; namely, that “direct-to-DVD” doesn’t necessarily equal “bad.” In The Code, Banderas and Freeman play criminals who form a tenuous partnership in order to pull off a huge heist in New York City; gangsters, girls, double-crosses, and, yes, a room full of lasers provide familiar genre obstacles for the pair, who enjoy a smooth chemistry onscreen in a genre exercise that probably could have performed well in theaters in the ’90s.In this regard, Banderas is a happy pragmatist, and well aware of the difficulties (and values) of working outside of Hollywood on independent productions like The Code. “The work is what you do when you are acting,” he told us, satisfied with the experience alone. “But that’s the way it goes!”Read on to see which auteurs Banderas noted among his favorites, why he joined the cast of Mimi Leder’s The Code (out this week on DVD) just weeks before filming, his thoughts on independent filmmaking, Fellini, Bunuel, and more, and how being a pragmatist is necessary for an artist in his particular line of work.8 1/2 (1963,97% Tomatometer)Why? Well, I think it’s an act of freedom, the whole entire movie, practically. They didn’t have a script. In 1962, which is the year when the movie was shot, I thought it was unbelievable that somebody would just go into an experiment like that. It’s still a very experimental movie, very emotional in a way. I like what he says about the human spirit and creation; in a way, crisis of a man confronting life, his past, his present and his future in a very formal way. I mean formal in terms of format, how the movie was told, not only in the content of the movie, which is amazing. Also in the way that he decided to just do it absolutely free, inventing new rules for telling a story and not going in a traditional way. I thought it was the masterpiece of Federico Fellini that most attracted me; I feel very proud that I know [what it’s like for] a guy like Federico Fellini, who got the balls to just jump into such believable, reflections of mirrors, you know, inside the movie.Lawrence of Arabia (1962, 98% Tomatometer)I love the scope of the movie; there is something in David Lean that I like very much. He’s always of the macro worlds and the micro worlds; he didn’t only do it in Lawrence of Arabia, but repeated it in Dr. Zhivago and other movies. [In Lawrence of Arabia] he made a movie with enormous scope and events that were known in the world — the Turkish-British War, and at the time, the taking of Akaba — things that were very spectacular and very epic, but in reality he’s talking to us about the homosexuality of one of the characters and something really minimalistic and very precise. He gets into the soul of a man through this spectacular movie and this union of these two worlds. He did it again in Dr. Zhivago as I said before, because in a way he put together the entire Russian revolution, which is also very big, while in reality telling a love story. So this kind of union, joining, he does between the macro world and the micro world is something that I was always interested in, and he was a master of doing the type of job. It’s one of those movies that always remain in your mind. Also, he gave himself permission to do it in a way that probably no studio would buy in our day; just to see a man coming from five miles into the camera for two minutes and a half — no executive producer would allow that to happen! He gave himself permission to do that, and I had the luck of seeing a remastered version of Lawrence of Arabia in a theater in Spain 10 years ago, and it was magnificent because it gave you the possibility of thinking, which is unusual.We also have the performance of first time movie actor Peter O’Toole. That was the first movie that he did, which I didn’t know until I worked with Omar Sharif in a movie that I did years ago called 13th Warrior, and he told me that. At the time, he was a very prominent theater actor in London, but that was the first movie that he did. I will never forget those blue eyes on the big screen. Amazing!The Godfather (1972,100% Tomatometer)Francis Ford Coppola; he’s one of my favorites, too.The Exterminating Angel(1962, 94% Tomatometer)&nbsp;The Exterminating Angel is a surrealistic movie. It’s about a bunch of people from high society in Mexico who, after one night at the opera, decide to have drinks in the house of one of them, and they cannot get out. And they spend about three months there, and you don’t know why they cannot get out, but they cannot. [Laughs] It’s a very, very beautiful and interesting story — also risky, and very misunderstood at the time that the movie opened. But you know, that’s what happened sometimes; after the second World War, naturalism and realism won the battle, so it was imposed that cinema had to be realistic always. But there was a time that it was not like that; Russians were doing expressionist movies, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari for example in Germany, and all these German directors, they were doing another type of approach to movies in formal terms. And in Spain, too, we had Luis Bunuel who was doing this type of surreal movies that were very interesting. Now they can be revised in sort of a different way, with time passed. But Luis Bunuel is definitely one of my favorite directors of all time.Touch of Evil (1958, 94% Tomatometer)I’m going to go to a guy who, being American, loved Spain; actually, he’s buried physically in the land where my father was born, in Ronda, Spain. His name is Orson Welles, and the movie is Touch of Evil.Next: Banderas speaks candidly about why he joined the cast of Mimi Leder’s The Code, the challenges that face independent films in a studio-run world, and accepting the fate of the “direct-to-DVD” film. Plus, Fellini fan Banderas shares his hopes for Rob Marshall’s upcoming film Nine, adapted from the Broadway musical for which Banderas won a Tony nomination.You named 8 ½ as one of your favorite films, but you actually earned accolades for your performance on stage in Nine, an adaptation of the film. How did that stage experience differ from your experience watching the film?Antonio Banderas: Yes I did, actually. It was half a point more, it was Nine. [Laughs] So in a way, I am familiar with the movie, the work, but it was a theatrical experience, slightly different. I know that Federico Fellini actually saw it in 1982 when Raul Julia played it, and he loved the version that they did of it at the time. I never met Federico, unfortunately.How do you feel about 8 ½ being adapted yet again, in a way, with the film version of Nine?AB: I know, they already did the movie and apparently it’s brilliant. What they did actually is not an adaptation of 8 ½, what they did is an adaptation for cinema of the play that I did. Daniel Day-Lewis is playing [Guido, the main character] and some friends of mine like Penelope Cruz… I didn’t see the trailer but my wife saw it the other day and she said it looks fantastic. And I hope the best for them, although I think they’re not going to need my hope and I think they did a great job and they’ll be very successful and I’m happy for them.What is it in the material that lends itself to multiple adaptations?AB: I think that Federico did something that is very open and you can reflect very much over the work that he did, there’s always an open door to revise the material with the years. When you’re talking about [the subject of] creation, it’s something that’s very wide and you can get with different times different opinions and points of view, and I think Rob Marshall probably did a great job.You also named Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia, and I agree that it’s sadly true that movies that risky are seldom made anymore.AB: It’s very difficult if you want to do those movies within structures that are based in commercial issues. You can do movies like that if you go in the independent world. In fact, last year for example Slumdog Millionaire is a movie that comes from that world, and it breaks structures because they are more daring. But coming from the studios, it’s very difficult to find that. I’m not criticizing the studios; they have to do what they have to do. They’re looking for commercial movies, and that’s fantastic and it keeps alive the industry and I think that’s absolutely fine. But if you want to find those types of risks, you have to go to another structure. I think movies serve many purposes; one can be purely entertainment, another can be a reflection of the human spirit, and another goes in another direction, experimental… many, many different purposes. All of them are good. I am not criticizing specifically one way of making movies; this just is the way it is.Above: Banderas with co-star Radha Mitchell in The Code&nbsp;Speaking of the studio system and working outside of it, when I watched The Code I was surprised at how good it was considering the stigma that, frankly, “direct-to-DVD” films carry with them. But going straight to home video seems to be increasingly the best option for many independently-produced films these days.AB: It’s curious, the case of this movie The Code. Because it’s a genre movie, and those are movies that normally are supposed to be done by studios. It’s very rare — this is an independent company, but they emulate the studios in a way. It’s very difficult to compete with that, because if you have a $20 million movie playing genre, confronting a studio movie with $120 million budget that is doing genre too, obviously in visual terms and many other ways of looking at a movie these days, especially by the young people who go to the movies these days, it’s very difficult to put in competition a movie like The Code with the movies that they have. You know, The Code is a movie that probably, if it would have been presented in the ’70s or the ’80s, would have been a very successful movie.When I saw it, I thought that it could have had a good theatrical run even as recently as the ’90s.AB: It’s funny, because in Spain, it was released theatrically and it did very well with practically no promotion at all, competing with big Hollywood movies. And I understand that they’re going to open in like 25 countries also, theatrically. But in America, no — there were offers from studios, I am aware of that because I talked to [Nu Image and Millenium Pictures head] Avi Lerner, but they didn’t want to give the money necessary to compete in a theatrical environment in terms of publicity and promotion. But that’s the way it goes! [Laughs] That is our world.For me, I joined [the project] very late in the movie; almost 15 days before they started, they called me. And so I had to travel to New York very fast… but for me, the big attraction for accepting the role was Morgan Freeman, to tell you the truth. The possibility of working with an actor that I really admire. He’s got a tremendous personality. He’s one of those guys that it doesn’t matter what he does in front of the camera, he’s always interesting because he’s got this aura. And then, Mimi Leder became one of my attractions to the project, because she’s a woman that has inside more than I have seen in the movies. A couple of movies of hers I really like, and when I saw her working, she’s very powerful. There’s also a sensitivity coming from women that I love, and I’ve been directed by women three or four times, in terms of directing actors and managing the entire set. It’s very interesting. So all of those elements made it for me. Then, the results are something that you never know what’s going to happen, especially in a movie like this — a genre movie made by an independent company. That is the problem.Of course, that all makes sense. Even so, it seems like a very good thing that you take a pragmatic approach to the business.AB: Oh, absolutely. You have to be, in this professional world; otherwise you’d spend your whole life in a psychiatric ward! Going up and down continuously, “I am great!” “I am depressed.” No, I think it’s important that you understand in this profession that the results are not continuously the most important thing. But the way that you work and the things that you do, for me it’s very important in my mind to have clear that my professional life starts at “action!” and finishes at “cut,” and whatever happens around that — yeah, it can be very satisfying sometimes, it can be very depressing at times, but it’s just another side of the work. The work is what you do when you are acting. And, I have to say, during the time that we were doing The Code I felt I was doing what I wanted to do.&nbsp;Watch an exclusive clip from The Code:Watch Antonio Banderas in Mimi Leder’s The Code, available this week on DVD.

He’s directed some of the most beloved action films of the last 20 years, including Die Hard 2, Deep Blue Sea, The Long Kiss Goodnight and, of course, Cliffhanger (sample dialogue: “I must say, you’re a real piece of work.” “I must say, you’re a real piece of shit.”). His latest, the faintly-ridiculous but always-enjoyable 12 Rounds continues this tradition.He’s also, however, responsible for two of the most reviled movies of recent times — for notorious flop Cutthroat Island and for taking a hatchet to Paul Schrader‘s The Exorcist: The Beginning. For someone with such a varied back catalogue, we had no idea what his five favourite movies would be.Click on a thumbnail below.Rosemary’s BabyThey Shoot HorsesApocalypse NowLawrence of ArabiaCinema ParadisoRosemary’s Baby“I would say that one of the most profound memories was when my mother – who was film fanatic and loved thrillers – took me to see Rosemary’s Baby when I was nine years old. The film had a huge impact on me and, of course, scared the shit out me! I certainly wouldn’t take my 10-year-old to see Rosemary’s Baby.“It is a masterpiece in terms of the way it uses the language of movies and it directed me towards Hitchcock and that kind of visual storytelling, and thrillers in general – or maybe more psychological thrillers. So that was my first and most memorable movie. It was the psychological fear and oddness, the oddness of the characters; I remember I didn’t even understand it all when I first saw it. Visually there were so many things that I hadn’t seen before that have stayed with me.”Click on a thumbnail below.Rosemary’s BabyThey Shoot HorsesApocalypse NowLawrence of ArabiaCinema ParadisoThey Shoot Horses, Don’t They?” I don’t know what it was about that movie that was just incredible. It was something about the storytelling, the characters, and the pace of the movie, the atmosphere of it and the tragic ending that absolutely blew my mind. It made me realise movies could tell stories in a different way. That was the day – when I was 11 years old – when I decided to get involved in movies. It was when I said to myself, “I want to be a director.” It was so powerful to me. It’s really worth seeing; it’s an amazing bleak, beautiful, tragic movie.”Click on a thumbnail below.Rosemary’s BabyThey Shoot HorsesApocalypse NowLawrence of ArabiaCinema ParadisoApocalypse Now“It’s a typical choice maybe. I’m a huge Coppola fan – I’ve seen it many times in many different versions and formats and that movie, to me, is just fantastic storytelling, interesting characters, maybe the best war film I’ve ever seen. You are transported into his incredibly exotic world and it tells the story of something that is based on reality but the director kind of creates his own reality. He constructs this horrible place – his own interpretation of hell and he that makes me believe in it. It’s a movie that I can always watch again and never get tired of, and it always feel like I’m in the presence of a genius magician. I think I prefer the theatrical cut of the movie. The Redux, with the scene with all the French colonialist people, I didn’t feel added much.”Click on a thumbnail below.Rosemary’s BabyThey Shoot HorsesApocalypse NowLawrence of ArabiaCinema ParadisoLawrence of Arabia“Another movie that is hugely influential to me and I never get tired of watching it. The cinemascope photography is unbelievable, evolutionary and fantastic. The performances, the production design and the pacing – it’s kind of slow but it draws you into it and it makes you wish there could still be movies like that nowadays. I mean most movies these days are made for teenagers. It’s almost as if people’s brains work differently these days. Maybe its commercials and music videos and videogames and you just want more stimuli at a faster pace. Filmmakers seem to be afraid to trust the audience more. I don’t mean that movies should be slow and boring, but if you have a good enough script you should be able to use the power of the image to tell a story. It’s like if you look at Pixar movies like Wall-E, actually I do think they have a slower pace, there’s such richness in every frame.”Click on a thumbnail below.Rosemary’s BabyThey Shoot HorsesApocalypse NowLawrence of ArabiaCinema ParadisoCinema Paradiso“Despite the kind of movies I make, I love small, little movies. I love foreign films in general, I love to see something that really moves me emotionally, and that moves me to tears. Maybe Cinema Paradiso is a little bit of a cliché, but I’m sure every cinema lover lists it as their favourite movie. There’s something so beautiful about it, I love the milieu of the little town and this boy’s story and what the whole thing says about how lives go and about our dreams and memories. When he grows up and goes to the movie theatre and sees all the bits that the priest cut out and it reminds him of his childhood… Cinema doesn’t get more beautiful. The whole film is about the incredible nostalgia of movies in general.”Click on a thumbnail below.Rosemary’s BabyThey Shoot HorsesApocalypse NowLawrence of ArabiaCinema Paradiso","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Music, Sci-Fi, 2017, toy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/RennyHarlin.jpg","slug":"five-favourite-films-with-renny-harlin"},{"id":"47508862223807","title":"Five Favourite Films with Gael Garcia Bernal","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favourite Films with Gael Garcia BernalThe Rudo y Cursi star puts together his list.by Joe Utichi | June 28, 2009 |  CommentsGael Garcia Bernal may be Mexico’s best known acting export of recent years, having made a powerful debut in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu‘s Amores perros in 2000. A year later he co-starred with Diego Luna (read his five favourites here) in Alfonso Cuaron‘s Y tu mama tambien. After a busy career which has seen him work with the likes of Pedro Almodovar, Michel Gondry and Fernando Meirelles, he reteams with Luna, and a different Cuaron — Carlos — for Rudo and Cursi.Of his five favourite films, Bernal had an easier time picking them than his co-star — and curiously they’ve both chosen a Disney classic as their first choice — and told us, “These films are definitely a little glimpse on who I am.

The book andfilm recounts Lopez’s (played byRobertDowney Jr.) friendship with Nathaniel Ayers (JamieFoxx), a Julliard prodigy discovered years later as a homeless,schizophrenic vagrant. The Soloist opens thisFriday in theaters everywhere. We spoke to Wright, discovering his own Five Favorite Films.&nbsp;Brief Encounter (1946,84% Tomatometer)Okay, so,Brief Encounter. I love it because of its consummate craftsmanship. It’s deeply British. It [has] perfect structure. Celia Johnson’s performance. And the way in which it’s a film about something not happening rather than something happening.Close Encounters ofthe Third Kind (1977, 95% Tomatometer)Close Encounters was the second film I ever saw in my life.What was the first?Bambi. And both films had the effect of scaring the living s–t out of me.I think I was about six or seven when I saw Close Encounters, and it was the psychological terror of the father and his obsession with the mountain. The sequence with him starting building the mashed potato mountain and then turning the whole house into this kind of chaos of obsession. It terrified the living crap out of me. I saw it at the Odeon in Leicester Square and some 25 years later I found myself standing on that stage introducingPride and Prejudice. I think one of the reasons why I make films is to overcome that initial fear of watching a film itself.Did you find Close Encounters frightening because it was a kind of domestic, invasive terror? Was this applied towards your own father?Just the father losing control, I guess. That kind of absolute obsessiveness and not knowing what was going on with this character who’s supposed to be stable and secure. So maybe I was applying it to my own father. [But] I think it’s a kind of archetypal fear, really.Blue Velvet (1986, 90% Tomatometer)Whatyear was Blue Velvet? It was ’86, wasn’t it? So I was 15 when it came outand my parents were away for the summer, and they’d left me in the house alone.I got hold of a VHS copy of Blue Velvet, and I started watching it, and Icouldn’t stop, and I got to the end of it, and rewound it, and played it againand again, 16 times over. And I watched it at least twice a day, every day, forthat entire summer. You can see perhaps why obsessive behavior scares me. And itjust blew my mind. I knew that cinema could be poetic, but I never had beforeunderstood that it could be poetic in that way, in such a raw and visceral way.And again, scared the living crap out of me. So there seems to be a themerunning through here.Last timewe spoke, you praisedNaomi Watts inMulholland Drive. Whatperformances strike you in Blue Velvet?All of them. Laura Dern,Dennis Hopper, all of them. They were all incredible init. I don’t know howDavid Lynch directs his actors. One day I hope to meet himto talk to him about it, because I don’t quite understand how he gets suchextraordinary performances. I think [Lynch’s] one of the best directors ofactors working today. …Or is he? [laughs]The Conformist(1970, 100% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Justfor its bold audacity. Its exquisite painterly quality. Its kind ofexpressionism, its style, and its kind of audacity to take on greatphilosophical themes in cinema.Are you a Bertolucci fan in general, or do you separate his later stuff fromhis early stuff?I’m afraid I separate his later stuff from his early stuff. [But] I don’t wantto f–k off the great master.The Apu Trilogy (1954-1959, average 97% Tomatometer)I’veonly recently come to watch those films (PatherPanchali, Aparajito, The World of Apu), and they’re just the most wonderful, simple, delicatestorytelling. Again, incredibly poetic, and opening up worlds that I hadn’timagined before. So delicate, and so honest and human. Seeing the whole of humanexperience related in the microcosm of this little family.No doubt you were aware of The Apu Trilogy‘s reputation. What were youexpecting?I’m glad to say I didn’t have too many preconceptions about it, other than, youknow, “It was a masterpiece.” And I’m always wary of such labels. I didn’treally know what it was about. I’m very excited that there are still films,these masterpieces, that I haven’t fully been introduced to.How recently did you see The Apu Trilogy?Only about six or seven months ago. I’m embarrassed to admit that. I’m reallyembarrassed.And what did they replace?I definitely would have had anAlan Clarkefilm in there. Maybe Alan Clarke’s Elephant.Catch Joe Wright’s The Soloist intheaters this Friday.

In celebration of tonight’s season finale(watch it on Fox at 8/7pm Central), Rotten Tomatoes caught up with Season 7winner and Platinum-selling recording artist David Cook, who will perform hissingle, “Permanent,” during tonight’s show. (Buy the live recording on iTunesand all proceeds will go to charity!)Cook shared with us his favorite films of all time, revealing that his tastestend toward rock music influences, silly humor, and quotable comedies. But willwe soon also see the 26-year-old venture into acting, a laKelly Clarksonand JustinGuarini, or even filling the dancing shoes ofZac Efron? Seewhat David Cook picked as his Five Favorite Films (and his plan to follow fellowIdol winners into Hollywood) below!Rock Star (2001, 52% Tomatometer)RockStar is an interesting movie for me; I watched it probably around 15 times.I love what it represents; I love that it’s almost a mockumentary of ’80sexcess. And any movie withJenniferAniston is always a good movie. But more than anything for me, I love themusic in it. I actually have bought the soundtrack twice — I lost the first one— and I’m a big Steel Dragon fan. I like Steel Dragon enough to know there aretwo singers who recorded the music for it, Jeff Scott Soto and MiljenkoMatijevic from Steelheart. I know more than I should.As a musicianyourself, how do you feel about the fact that it’s also a cautionary tale aboutrising too fast to stardom?Absolutely. You take what lessons you can from the movie, but I try to enjoyit but not get too caught up in it. Not to get too philosophical about RockStar.Some of your fellow American Idol winners have gone on to act in movies.Is that something you see in your future?You know what, I hope so. I got a little taste of acting in the last musicvideo we did [“Come Back To Me,” which was filmed entirely in reverse]. I had achance to do a little bit of acting — I don’t know how good I was — but I’ll getback into acting at some point. I know I want to do something of some substance,something I’ll feel proud of ten, twenty years down the line. I think it’s justa matter of everything falling into place at the right time. But I’m a musicianfirst, and I have a record to push.You know, film musicals are back. That genre combines both of yourinterests, music and acting.I heard that I got put on some survey of who should replace Zac Efronin Footloose, and I came in third. But I beat Bow Wow, so there’s hope.Is Footloose something you’d be interested in doing?&nbsp;Absolutely not! [Laughs] I can punch-dance with the best of them, don’t get mewrong. It’s all the other stuff — the actual dancing. [I did musical theater]and I think anyone who has seen me do that can attest to the fact that I cansing okay, I can act okay, but I was not good at dancing.TotallyAwesome (2006, Tomatometer N/A)Ihave always liked Tracy Morgan, and when I saw him in that movie teaching thiskid how to hit on women in a mall, and his head pops up and he says, “Peekaboo,I’m gonna hump you” — that is the funniest thing I’d ever heard in my life.Really, that alone made me want to pick this movie. Sometimes stupid humor isgreat, and that movie just puts me in a great mood.Philadelphia (1993, 74% Tomatometer)Iactually just got re-enamored with Philadelphia. I remember seeing it a fewyears back and really just loving A) the message behind it and B) I just thoughtthat everything about that movie is very subdued. The music — BruceSpringsteen, “The Streets of Philadelphia” — there’s an undertone to it that’svery calming, but also very heavy. I loved Tom Hanks’s performance in the movie;I thought it was amazing.Juno (2007, 93% Tomatometer)Junois for me, the perfect one-liner movie. “Thundercats are go!” “That’s one doodlethat can’t be undid.” I actually do use that one, more than rarely. It’s anotherfilm with a great overall soundtrack. It’s not a style of music that I alwaysfind myself getting into, but I think it’s one of those movies where thesoundtrack fits the film to a T. The movie itself is quirky, it’s got a kind ofa brash attitude, and I think the music really goes hand in hand with that.Run Ronnie Run (2002, 75% Tomatometer)Run,Ronnie, Run! From the creators of Mr. Show — David Cross and BobOdenkirk. It’s another movie full of one-liners. It’s a little more adult thanJuno, but to me it’s kind of a mix of Rock Star, Juno, andTotally Awesome. It’s kind of just dumb, funny humor, also kind of amockumentary about reality shows. Pretty much half of my daily vocabulary isfrom that movie.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Kimmy, comedies, Month, King, cartoon, Country, heist, to, movies, Holiday","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/DavidCook.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-american-idol-winner-david-cook"},{"id":"47509026906015","title":"Video: Who Is The Man in the High Castle?","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Who Is The Man in the High Castle?by Laura Hertzfeld | December 13, 2016 |  CommentsRotten Tomatoes contributor Laura Hertzfeld talks to&nbsp;The Man in the High Castle’s Stephen Root — who plays the titular “man” —&nbsp;Alexa Davalos, and Rupert Evans about season 2’s big reveal.The Man in the High Castle season 2 will be available to stream on Amazon beginning Friday, Dec. 16&nbsp;","section":"Video Interviews","tags":"Vudu, YouTube, Month","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/13165552/Man-in-the-high-castle-video-2.jpg","slug":"video-who-is-the-man-in-the-high-castle"},{"id":"47508865825240","title":"Five Favorite Films with Slumdog Millionaire‘s Anil Kapoor","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Slumdog Millionaire's Anil KapoorIt is written: the big Bollywood star reveals his major influences.by Alex Vo | March 31, 2009 |  CommentsSlumdog Millionaire‘s American audiences were enticed to watch by thename of director Danny Boyle or the movie’s kinetic exploration of an exotic,far-away underbelly. In India, the selling point very well may have beenAnil Kapoor. Kapoor, who portrays the movie’s shifty host of India’s version of WhoWants to Be a Millionaire?, is the movie’s biggest Bollywood name, somethingfashioned over three decades of work, which includes Mr. India (an early work byElizabeth director Shekhar Kapur for which Kapoor received great criticalacclaim). The story of Kapoor’s&nbsp; first international movie is a story weknow well now — the plot, the controversies, the international box officesuccess, and the endless trophies (including an ultimate Oscar Best Picture andKapoor’s own share of a SAG Oustanding Cast award). As he pursues new projectsin America (and on the release of Slumdog on DVD), RT sat down with Kapoor to get his Five Favorite Films.Gold Rush (1925, 100% Tomatometer)The films that really changed my life were all the films made by Charlie Chaplin. Films like The Gold Rush. They were silent films, they were black and white. As a kid,I would just completely get mesmerized with every aspect of cinema. That kind of magic I’d never yet seen, the magic Charlie Chaplin created on screen — in terms of performances, in terms of technique, in terms of innocence, in terms of purity. I would wonder, “Is there anyone in the world who can match this?” I would see other films, and I’d think, “No, this guy is a real genius.” He makes me smile.And sometimes he moves me.City Lights (1931, 100% Tomatometer)Ah, City Lights.[It] doesn’t [really] make an effort to do comedy or [try] to make me cry. It just flows so naturally.A true artist. And you don’t have to be sensible [to watch&nbsp; Chaplin’sfilms]. You [can be] a kid but you still can understand his films.&nbsp; [One] doesn’t need education, academic education, to understand or enjoy his films. And I would see in the theater, in the audience, all kinds of people: children, parents, grandparents, poor, rich, very rich people, everybody in the theater enjoying his films.Chaplin really influenced me on being an actor. And I remember, back in India, Raj Kapoor, was greatly influenced by Charlie Chaplin.[Kapoor] became one of the biggest filmmakers of our country. You know, [Kapoor] is one of the few filmmakers who are very very known in that part of the world, especially Russia and the Middle East, the Far East. All the countries, one of the most famous filmmakers, Raj Kapoor. And he was influenced by Charlie Chaplin.Everybody says, “Are you influenced by Raj Kapoor?” and I say, “No, I’m not inspired by Raj Kapoor, I’m inspired by Charlie Chaplin.” It all goes back to that. And if you see my films, films like Woh 7 Din, Mr. India, and all those kinds of films, there is a bit of Chaplin. In every role which I do to this day, there is that flavor, because I’ve been influenced by all this. I will always think, if there is a scene, I will always have him in mind. Even in Slumdog Millionaire…[My performance in Slumdog Millionaire] is very animated, it’s very flamboyant.That influence always works when I’m doing those kinds of roles. There are certain times when I’m slightly larger than life and animated, still in control and still looking natural, and not looking like a buffoon, and not looking caricaturish. Still looking real. I think some way it is the influence of Charlie Chaplin. And even if I can achieve one percent or two percent of what he has achieved in this life in terms of art, in terms of what he has done, I’ll feel pretty fulfilled. When I try to do stuff which he has done, a little bit here and there, then I realize what a great man he was, and what a great character he was, and what he accomplished. Very, very difficult. I heard that he would rehearse for hours and days for every punch. For everypunch. And there are times when I’m doing my films, I say, “Let’s copy thispunch on this film.” And we could never get it. We just couldn’t get it.The Great Dictator (1940, 100% Tomatometer)You can go into the depth and go inside into his mind, and it’s like miles and miles of depth. Which you can’t really get in the actor’s realm, but Charlie Chaplin could get. And his speech in The Great Dictator, the way he spoke when he played Hitler in The Great Dictator. It is one of the greatest monologues to come out of cinema. Nobody has ever been able to achieve that.Every movie by Laurel &amp; Hardy (1921 – 1951)I feel performance cannot be done in isolation. So when I talk about teamwork, when I talk about timing between two actors, timing between two actors, I think about Laurel &amp; Hardy. It’s like two sides of a coin. It’s the quickest examples of two people creating magic, two actors creating magic. I look up to these people [and] I get influenced by [them], because I try to create these things. I see others trying to create that thing, but nobody has succeeded yet.Laurel &amp; Hardy [are] completely timeless. And anything in art which is timeless — it might be architecture, it might be paintings, whatever you do — [if] it’s great art, it will entertain the people all over the world for centuries and centuries.The Godfather (1972, 100% Tomatometer)Everything just fell in place. The right people, the right director, the right script, the right timing, what the world was going through. Everything just fell right. SoGodfather, Slumdog Millionaire, Laurel &amp; Hardy, and Chaplin. Well, it’s too early to talk aboutSlumdog, but I’m sure after 50 or 100 years people are going to say that everything just fell in the right [place] forSlumdog.The Godfather is not [just] an American hit, it’s really a worldwide film. Anywhere [you go]: China, Japan, Mexico. Everywhere students of cinema, ordinary people, everybody just loved the film. It’s got that cinematic magic, The Godfather. And, you know, it’s the lighting, the camerawork, the editing, the performances, the casting, the colors, the costumes. It was cinema at its best, and I’m sure it is something which, as you say, was written. Just everything fell in place. It doesn’t happen with everybody, it’s [when] people are [from] a certain kind of work culture [that] these things happen normally.What I like about The Godfather [is that] it’s very classical. [Coppola] just leaves the camera. You never see the camera moving. It’s very static and it’s the actors [who are moving]. [But] still you create the magic. You don’t have to juggle the camera to attract attention.The music also is very subtle. Everything is subtle. Your mind is throbbing, your [hairs are] rising, you’re on the edge of your seat, but still everything is so calm and relaxed. It’s cinema at its best. Slumdog? That’s also cinema at its best but everything [is] movement. There’s so much movement, there’s so much energy, the script is moving, the screenplay, the camera is moving, the actors are moving, everything is moving. But still, you understand the story. It is in control. Still, it moves you.Catch Anil Kapoor in Slumdog Millionaire on DVD this week.

(They don’t call him “Mr. Blockbuster” for nothing.) So what’s Bruckheimer doing producing this week’s estrogen-powered Confessions of a Shopaholic, starring a radiant Isla Fisher alongside the fab fashion mise-en-scenes of Sex and the City designer Patricia Fields?He’s taking people (in this case, the chick lit crowd) on a journey. In our discussion below, RT chats with Bruckheimer about his Five Favorite Films, many of which were directed by a sort of blockbuster magician of another generation, the celebrated British filmmaker David Lean. All five of his favorites, however, share certain elements that Bruckheimer strives for in his own career — a fortuitous combination of great writing, great visual style, and great casting. (They also share a lot in common with the picks of last week’s Five Favorite Films subject, Djimon Hounsou, to which Bruckheimer quips, “Really? He’s a smart man.”)Below, Jerry Bruckheimer reminisces on working with Paul Schrader and the late artistic director Ferdinando Scarfiotti, with whom he worked on Cat People and American Gigolo, and compares the plight of Shopaholic‘s indebted heroine to America’s current economic crisis. Intriguingly, Bruckheimer also argues that there is no glass ceiling in Hollywood for female filmmakers today (although Confessions of a Shopaholic is helmed by male director P.J. Hogan). Read on for all this and more with Jerry Bruckheimer.&nbsp;The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957, 95% Tomatometer), Lawrence of Arabia (1962,98% Tomatometer), Dr. Zhivago (1965,84% Tomatometer)I’m a big fan of David Lean. Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, and Dr. Zhivago take up three of my favorites. This can go for all three of Lean’s films, because they’re all very similar. They all have very strong characters, very developed characters. He has a unique visual style; it’s very important for the way the movie looks. There are stories about how he’d sit in the desert for half a day, just waiting for the clouds to be right before he’d start filming. You can imagine what a producer would be doing during this. [Smiles] So I love films that have strong visual styles, and all of those films have very unique styles.The Godfather (1972,100% Tomatometer)The Godfather is another big favorite of mine. It’s a great characterization. Fantastic casting, in every film. I can generalize on all of these favorite films, because they all have the same elements to them. Very strong directors; very strong writers. Robert Bolt wrote most of David Lean’s movies. You have a fantastic screenwriter working at your hand, penning these wonderful characters.Raging Bull (1980, 98% Tomatometer)Another masterful director [Martin Scorsese]. Paul Schrader was one of the writers on that, another great writer and director. Casting, again; De Niro is amazing.Next: Bruckheimer on Paul Schrader, making films to “empower women,” and how he pulls each project togetherSpeaking of Paul Schrader, I recently watched Cat People.Jerry Bruckheimer: It’s cute, isn’t it? Not cute, but it’s out there.It’s visually amazing. There are a number of things you’ve mentioned that seem to resonate, among them Paul Schrader delaying production a few times…do you remember making that movie very well?JB: That’s right! Ferdinando Scarfiotti was the designer on it; he was just a genius, he really was. He was from Italy, and he comes to America and has a whole different perspective on what he sees. Things that you and I pass by every day that become commonplace, they’re unique to him. It’s so interesting to see things through his eyes, and that’s what that movie was. He also did American Gigolo, which I produced, with Paul Schrader.I heard there was some lobby to get him a co-director credit because of how much he contributed.JB: He was a genius, and one of the sweetest men ever. Just an amazing individual.[rtimage]MapID=1191984&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Now, we’ve got Confessions of a Shopaholic, which at first glance seems like somewhat of a departure for you.JB: A little bit, but not really. My first [romantic comedy] was 25 years ago, with Flashdance, and then we did Coyote Ugly. But I like to make movies that empower people — especially women — and I think this is a very powerful film. All three of those movies empower women, and take them on a journey. Shopaholic is the journey of this young girl who obviously has problems. She doesn’t like her job, she has a spending problem. And through the course of the movie, through her own conviction and through her own realization, she overcomes her problems, finds something she really likes doing, and finds romance. I think we all look for that. A lot of us have had jobs we hated, or have problems we have to overcome. So I think it’s nice for young kids to see that they can come out of these things.On the one hand, you see Isla Fisher in Patricia Fields’ fabulous clothes, and on the other you have this story about debt which is really quite timely in today’s economic climate.JB: It’s so funny how things happen. When we bought this book years ago, the country was flying high. Now we have the same problems that Rebecca Bloomwood (Isla Fisher’s character) has. We’ve spent too much, put too much on credit, and now they’ve come to collect and we don’t have the money. We have to take some lessons from Becky.[rtimage]MapID=1191984&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Could you compare Shopaholic to any of your big action blockbusters, in terms of how you put the pieces together?JB: I think you try to find the strengths and weaknesses of all the people you work with. If the director’s very visual — like Ridley Scott and Tony Scott, the Scott brothers are both very visual — then it doesn’t matter who the designer or the cinematographer is; it’s really their vision and you just have to have someone who’s very good at executing their vision. But other directors focus on character and story, and they don’t have the desire to have something more brilliant; that’s not their expertise. You have to find the Nando Scarfiottis of the world to come in and design the film. It’s the same thing with the cinematographer. Some directors are trained a different way, and they don’t have the skill and the understanding of what good cinematography is, so you’ll have to get a brilliant cinematographer. It’s all mixing and matching the talents of the people that surround you.Some writers write great characters and great dialogue, but their storytelling is not as good. In the old Hollywood system, studios used to have writers under contract. Every screenplay went through five different writers. It started with the plotter, the guy who wrote the great plots, then they’d give it to the character person, then they’d it to the punch up dialogue, then they’d give it to the female writer, who bolstered the female characters, then they’d bring in somebody, if it was an action movie, who understood how to write action… it went through all these different hands. That’s why you have all those great movies in the ’30s and ’40s that had brilliant dialogue; they went through so many different typewriters.Next: Bruckheimer on the best writers in Hollywood, gender politics in Hollywood, and why he selected a man to direct the female-centric Confessions of a Shopaholic[rtimage]MapID=1191984&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Do you think a similar writing system could work today?JB: Well, we sort of do it. It’s rare that we have writers like Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, who can actually do everything. The problem is, there may be ten of them in Hollywood, and they’re always busy so you can’t always get them. So you have to find somebody else and nurture them along, or you have to go through a bunch of different computers to get where you have a complete screenplay.How did you decide on hiring P.J. Hogan (Muriel’s Wedding) to direct Confessions?JB: You just look at his work. He’s wonderful with female characters, he’s wonderful with comedy, and he’s got a very light touch. He understands physical comedy. He was the perfect choice.Confessions is poised to become a female-driven blockbuster. It’s a female movie, with a female audience. So why not hire a female director?JB: I don’t look it as far as gender. I look at it as who’s available at the time, who’s the most talented. These pictures have a very short window in which they can get made, so you try to get a list of people who you think are really talented, and they start getting crossed off one by one because they’re making other movies.[rtimage]MapID=1191984&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Why do you think there is such a lack of female filmmakers in mainstream movies?JB: I think that’s changing. I think you saw that when you saw Twilight; [director Catherine Hardwicke] is very talented. There’s a whole group of young women and older women who are directing now, doing very well.True, but I feel like despite there being a handful of established female directors, like Catherine Hardwicke, even with her success — nobody really knows what happened in the decision making process with the Twilight sequel, New Moon.JB: From what I’ve read, it seems that most studios want to make movies for less money and she felt that she needed a little more…Or a little more time —JB: Well, time is money. [Smiles][rtimage]MapID=1191984&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=7&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]So from what you can tell, Hollywood isn’t terribly unbalanced gender-wise –there’s not a huge uphill battle facing aspiring female filmmakers?JB: Not at all. Quite the opposite. Historically, they’ll even hire people who have all kinds of problems, as long as they can make money. It’s all about talent.For a director, do you think it helps or not to be an auteur?JB: It works either way. It depends on what kind of auteur you are; if you’re a commercial auteur, that’s one thing. If you’re an auteur who makes very personalized movies that people don’t go see, it’s much harder to get work — or to get people to finance your films.What is your favorite Jerry Bruckheimer film?JB: I don’t have one — they’re all favorites. They’re all your children.Confessions of a Shopaholic opens in wide release February 13, 2009. Click here for a full synopsis, photo gallery and trailers. Want more Five Favorite Films?

Accordingly, one may be taken aback to hear that McGuigan names romantic auteur Wong Kar-Wai among his favorite directorial influences, but as he demonstrates in Push — which captures the vibrant streets of Hong Kong in lush detail, appropriately — McGuigan possesses a strong visual finesse that belies his history of making brutal crime movies and Hollywood suspense flicks.McGuigan shared his Five Favorite Films with Rotten Tomatoes, which range from the above mentioned work of Wong Kar-Wai to UK family classics to the edgy work of Darren Aronofsky and beyond. Read on to discover the films most loved by Paul McGuigan, and learn what Hitchockian backstory he’s developing into a feature film.&nbsp;In the Mood for Love (2001, 88% Tomatometer)It’s such a beautiful cinematic poem, I suppose. When I did Push in Hong Kong, it was a great pleasure to be able to shoot the film almost in the style of Wong Kar-Wai — just with him in mind, you know. Beautiful light, reds and greens. I actually stayed in one of the apartments in Hong Kong that he designed, which was nice. Lots of wallpaper. As a movie, you’re just so compelled by these two characters, and he only shows glimpses of them, yet they’re so compelling — which is a feat in itself.Have you taken any cues from Wong Kar-Wai in your overall directorial style?I’d like to think so. I would never compare myself to Wong Kar-Wai — that would be silly, that would be like comparing yourself to David Beckham. But I would like to make more work that has the kind of silence that he has, you know?Push isn’t quite that quiet film, is it?Push is really loud. There’s not much silence in Push. [Laughs] It’s a pretty cool movie; it’s not going to stretch you intellectually, but it’s definitely going to make you have some fun at the cinema. In a way, that’s as much a part of what I do as anything; just to entertain people. It was great for me to do something like this. I mean, imagine going to work and talking about f***ing floating guns, you know?Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968, 59% Tomatometer)My second favorite film is probably even more intellectually challenging than Wong Kar-Wai; it’s Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. I f***ing love that movie! I have two children; I’ve probably seen this movie, with each child, about 50 times each. And that’s no exaggeration. There’s nothing I don’t know about this movie. I once went to a meeting with an executive in Hollywood, and they asked me what I wanted to do. I said, ‘I’d love to do a remake of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang‘ — I was just making it up — ‘and I’d call it Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Boom,’ and he said that’s a great title! [Laughs] I was only kidding. But that’s a movie I really love.In the UK at Christmastime, the girls would get The Sound of Music and the boys would get Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. It was that kind of thing, where every Christmas you would see it. So when I had kids, of course I put it on for my son and then he became obsessed with it. It’s the kind of movie where you never really get to the end; it’s so long, and the kids can only really wait so long. But the beginning of the film is like 20 minutes long, before anything even happens. It’s just the story of the car. It’s fantastic!The Man in the White Suit (1951, 100% Tomatometer)Alex Guinness, to me is — forget De Niro, forget Pacino — he’s the man. Alec Guinness is such a quintessential English actor, but he’s also a brilliant actor. He’s just the best. And The Man in the White Suit is just such a beautiful, charming movie. It’s about a man who invents a suit that you don’t have to wash. It’s a whole movie about it! It’s something that some of the more flamboyant directors should think about remaking. [Laughs] It’s about this guy who invents this material that keeps white all the time. It’s directed by Alexander Mackendrick, a fellow Scot, and the opening title sequence is amazing. Mackendrick is a brilliant director. I just enjoy his work; I enjoy the pace of his work. I think he’s really overlooked. He did The Ladykillers and Whisky Galore, and The Sweet Smell of Success. A lot of really cool movies.Alec Guinness, to me — forget Star Wars and all that — he’s just the best. And to work with someone like Alexander Mackendrick, who really understood what a story meant…it’s funny, because on IMDB the movie is listed as sci-fi. It’s not sci-fi, that’s ridiculous! It’s actually a very nice tale, about inventing the thing that nobody wants. Like a car that doesn’t need petrol. The thing that people don’t want because of the money [the auto industry] could make off of you. If you say hey great, I’ve invented this car that doesn’t need petrol, and then there’s a silence, and then there’s a gunshot, and you’re dead. It’s that kind of thing.Rear Window (1954, 100% Tomatometer)I love Hitchcock’s Rear Window. I’m actually developing a movie about Robert Capa, who was a war photographer that Hitchcock seemingly based the movie on. I used to take photographs; I was a photographer for many years, and I’m intrigued by this idea. I think it’s a wonderful idea about being a voyeur. He just watches his next door neighbors, and becomes convinced that one of them has been killed. It’s the idea of what you see versus what you really see.I loved making documentaries for that very reason; you just watch people, even after you’ve shot it. You go back to the edit suite and watch them, and you can understand when they’re telling the truth and when they’re lying. You get to know that stuff. It’s really fascinating — the idea that you can have a movie about something that might have happened… it’s a trick of the eye, or using the camera in a fascinating way. You’re using it to tell a story based on intrigue, and I don’t think I’ve seen that before, or since.Requiem for a Dream (2000, 78% Tomatometer)Requiem for a Dream is a really interesting film. It changed my idea of what people really wanted to see. Because I came from the UK, as a European film director, it was interesting to see how American studios or financiers were really into European cinema. They would always quote certain movies that I made that nobody else had seen — like Gangster No. 1. I was amazed, like, ‘Wow, you’ve actually seen that movie?’ And it dawned on me that people in America aren’t that dumb after all, you know? They’re kind of smart — much smarter than I was about movies. And when I saw Requiem for a Dream, I understood it. This guy got cash, he got money, to make this movie. It’s quite a hard movie to actually sell — can you imagine trying to sell that movie? And for that alone I think Aronofsky is a genius. I like what he does. I even liked The Fountain. The Wrestler is a great movie; I think Pi is a genius piece of work. I think he deserves a lot of praise.For people like me, who come from Europe and go to America and think nobody’s going to know what I’ve done, I’m a struggling filmmaker, and then suddenly you go into a studio and the head exec is like, ‘Gangster No. 1, I loved that film, it had this and that person in it…’ They see everything. I was quite cheered by that.Push opens in wide release February 6, 2009. Click here for a full synopsis, photo gallery and trailers.Want more Five Favorite Films?

He caught his first big break as a supporting player in the Best Picture-winning From Here to Eternity, and after a series of sharp secondary roles, he rose to prominence in Marty, the story of a lonely butcher who makes a connection with a shy schoolteacher. Borgnine won a Best Actor Oscar for the role (and he remains the oldest-living Best Actor winner). After Marty, Borgnine co-starred in a number of memorable films, including The Dirty Dozen and The Wild Bunch. Borgnine also had a recurring voice role on SpongeBob SquarePants, and he picked up a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the 2007 TV film A Grandpa for Christmas.In addition to his favorite films, Borgnine discussed why directors were easier to work with in the old days, a hairy situation on location, and why there was no one quite like Gary Cooper.Life Is Beautiful (2012) That is such a beautiful picture. I like the acting, I like the premise, I like the genuine honesty about the whole thing. It was one of those joyous things; even when [Roberto Benigni] was riding a bicycle, he was enjoying it, you know? ‘This is life, this is exceptional, this is something good!’ It’s just so beautiful. And it’s from the head and from the heart, and that’s what counts. And to me, Life is Beautiful is a beautiful film.Citizen Kane (1941)  99%There’s another one called Citizen Kane. Here’s a man [Orson Welles] who didn’t look back and read about [William] Randolph Hearst and say, ‘sorry, I won’t make it until [Hearst dies]. He said, ‘To hell with it. I’m gonna make it anyway. If you see yourself in it, fine, that’s too bad.’ And he made it! And it was true! And the way he made it, and the way he works…. Ahhh. I had the opportunity to meet him one time, and I said, ‘Mr. Welles?’ And he said (mimicking Welles’ baritone voice), ‘Orson’s the name, and if you don’t win the g-d—ed Academy Award for Marty, I’m gonna quit it altogether.’ He was that kind of a fellow. He was a good man.The Good Earth (1937)  95%The Good Earth, with Paul Muni and Luise Rainer. What a piece of work. That to me is one you can watch all day long and not get tired of it. It’s wonderful.Black City (Il re di Poggioreale) (1961) There’s one called Il Re di Poggioreale, The King of Poggioreale. It was called [Black City] in this country. The King of Poggioreale was one of [producer] Dino De Laurentiis‘ first pictures, and it was directed by Duilio Coletti. It was the story about a boot-maker in Poggioreale, outside of Naples. This cobbler, who was a complete nothing, a nobody, went on to become the big black marketer in Italy in World War II. And this actually happened. When people in Naples were starving to death, he managed to find food — steal it from the Germans, steal it from the Americans, steal it from anybody — to feed the people of Naples. And then, because of his knowledge of things, they sent him to the Vatican to bring back the jewels of St. Gennaro, who is the patron saint of Naples. And he went through the German lines, and came back with the jewels. Nobody ever expected him to come back. They said, ‘This man, he’s taken everything and run away with it.’ But he came back. And [the movie] actually showed what the people of Naples actually do today. One of the things about St. Gennaro is that they have his blood in what almost looks like a rolling pin. They roll it back and forth, and they move it back and forth, and it’s all dried blood. If there’s a good time coming for Naples, that blood will actually turn and become blood. In this picture, we took pictures of it — unbeknownst to anyone else — and you can actually see the blood flowing. It was a wonderful picture, and I played the lead. And I tell ya, I never enjoyed doing anything so much since Marty.Marty (1955)  98%I played Marty because I was Marty. I was the kind of guy that was a wall flower. I didn’t know how to dance. To get a girl — my goodness, that was beyond comprehension for me, because I could see myself being turned down and I wasn’t the kind of person that liked to be turned down, you know? Why bother to ask if you’re going to be turned down? So I never asked. That was it. But time went along and I went into the service, and I grew up. When I saw that script, I said, ‘My God, that’s me.’ I was very happy to do it, because it gave me the opportunity to play something that I could easily play, and I knew that I had in my heart exactly what happened.Next: Borgnine talks about his favorite actors, and recounts a scary moment south of the border.Rotten Tomatoes: You’ve worked with so many of the greats, actors like Kirk Douglas, Spencer Tracy, and Burt Lancaster. Who was the best actor you worked with?Ernest Borgnine: It’s a tossup. One was Spencer Tracy, and the other was Gary Cooper. Now, people say to me, “Oh c’mon, he got it for saying ‘yup.'” (Editor’s note: Cooper was known for saying “yup” instead of “yes,” and it became a signature line for the actor.) Yeah? Watch him! He was so honest and true unto himself. This is what an actor is all about. And it’s true of Spencer Tracy, don’t get me wrong. But Gary Cooper was the kind of a fellow that, with a look, with a glance, with a touch of his finger — with just a little, tiny move, you could see what kind of an actor he was, because you felt it. You knew what he was going through. When he did [Meet John Doe], where he was gonna throw himself off that building, you knew he was gonna throw himself off! There was no doubt about it. He was that honest. He said to me one time when we were riding along in a car, he said, “You know, I sure wish I could act like you.” I said, “But sir, you’ve got two Academy Awards that show that you’re a good actor!” He said, “I got ’em for saying ‘yup.'” That was his excuse. But for me, every time he’s on the television, I watch him like a hawk, because he was so pure and honest it wasn’t funny.RT: Speaking of Gary Cooper, you were in Vera Cruz together, and I heard an anecdote about something that happened when you went to buy cigarettes on location in Mexico, dressed as bandits and wearing fake guns. Is that true?EB: Yeah! Charlie Bronson and I started off to get some cigarettes, and we were dressed up in costume, naturally. A whole truckload of soldiers went by, and we said, “Hola! Como le va?” Y’know? “Hello! How are you?” And we kept on, and all of a sudden we heard, “Alto!” Which means “Halt!” We turned around and all these guys had pointed pistols at us! We said, “We’re actors! We’re actors!” Oh, God, we were frightened! It wasn’t easy, I tell ya. We were going to get some cigarettes, that’s all!&nbsp;Borgnine (far right) in The Wild Bunch.&nbsp;RT: As someone who spent 10 years in the Navy, how many war films come close to depicting the experience in any real way?EB: I think The Longest Day was just about the best of ’em. Tora! Tora! Tora! was pretty good, but The Longest Day is just about the best of them, because it showed the guys trying to get up that cliff and everything else. It must have been hell. I wasn’t in any part of that, and I’m so glad I wasn’t, but I could just feel what those fellows were doing that day, and believe me, it wasn’t easy. And there’s Gary Cooper’s Sergeant York. He won the Academy Award for that one. Boy, what a piece of work that is.RT: Are there any younger actors whose work you admire?EB: The closest one that comes to mind — a wonderful actor — is Gary Sinise. What a great guy. What a wonderful person. Not only that, but I watched him where he took his band and performed for the troops overseas. I met him in person one time, and he said, “You mind if I come over and talk with you?” And I said, “No! C’mon!” It was the most wonderful hour you’ve ever seen in your life, and it passed like a minute. He can do no wrong, as far as I’m concerned. What a performance he did in Forrest Gump.&nbsp;Borgnine (center) in TV’s McHale’s Navy.&nbsp;RT: You’ve also worked with some prominent directors, like Sam Peckinpah, Nicholas Ray, Fred Zinnemann, and Robert Aldrich. Who was your favorite to work with?DG: Bob Aldrich. The Dirty Dozen, Emperor of the North, Flight of the Phoenix — he did it all. Believe me, working with him was like a dream. Delbert Mann was another one. When you worked with Delbert Mann, you got an acting lesson. He was wonderful. He didn’t direct you, he just kind of suggested things as you go along, and first thing you know, it’s the easiest thing in the world. I’ve worked with people who drum you over the head and then [they say], “Try it again. Try it again.” When I was working making pictures — real pictures — directors came on the set. They actually watched you on the set. They watched your expression. They watched everything. Today, they watch actors who insist on wearing dark glasses. You can’t see anybody’s eyes! And they watch all this not by being on the set, but by watching a little television set. And as long as it all fits within the allotted section of time, it’s like, “Hey, that’s it. Print it!” There’s no honesty. There’s no real feeling that goes beyond it, with the head and the heart and everything else. To me, my directors are always the man who leads the band, and I say, “Yes sir,” and “No sir,” and that’s it. I’m the only one who does it. Everybody calls him by his name, but I call him sir, because to me, he’s the director of the band, and when we’re off the stage, that’s when I call him by his first name, and that’s fine.For Borgnine’s complete filmography, click here.Want more Five Favorite Films?

So it’s probably no coincidencethat Bolt, Disney Animation’s first Certified Fresh feature in over sixyears, is also their first to have been fully supervised by Lasseter. Starring the voices of John Travolta and Miley Cyrus,Bolt (opening today) centers around a thespian dog who, with the help of aworld-weary cat and a fanboy hamster, explores America beyond the confinesof his TV set.We spoke with Lasseter in his Burbank office for his five favoritemovies of all time. He agreed to list them but with one request: “In a JohnLasseter top five, I would put a short in front of each of these. Typically,these are Chuck Jones shorts. Can’t have a top five without having theshorts.”Dumbo (1941, 97% Tomatometer)Dumbo is my favorite movie of all time. A remarkable motion picture. Just over 60 minutes, it’s so tight in terms of storytelling. It’s like [snaps fingers]. When you have kids and you watchDumbo, it really nails you because there’s that “Baby Mine” sequence. I like [Dumbo] because it’s the most cartoony of Disney features. I like it because the main character doesn’t talk. Such a wonderful film. It is very funny.Great music. It also really moves you. It has a really huge heart. Walt Disney always said that for every laugh, there should be a tear. I live by that.Lasseter’s bonus short: Rabbit SeasoningStar Wars (1977,95% Tomatometer)Probably everybody has that on their list. [Star Wars] came out and I just finished my sophomore year at CalArts. The May of ’77, saw it opening weekend at the Chinese Theatre. It worked in so many ways, but one of the things personally [that] was so inspiring [was] how it entertained an audience to a new level. I was there with a packed audience. I waited six hours. Towards the climax, when Luke is in the X-Wing and he’s going down the trench, I was just shaking I was so excited. And I’d never seen an audience so excited. First of all, it was everybody, from kids to adults, teenagers. Everybody was going crazy for this film. The quality of the storytelling, where it’s one foot in sort of the past and one foot in the future, I was so impressed by that. I came out and said, “That’s what I want to do with animation.” Many of my friends left animation [because ofStar Wars] and went to actual special effects. At that time, animation was thought of just for kids. I saw this and said, “No, no, I want to entertain audiences.” That’s all I think about when I make my movies.Bonus short: What’s Opera, Doc?Sullivan’sTravels (1941, 100% Tomatometer)I saw this for the first time at CalArts [and] since then I’ve become a big fan of all Preston Sturges films. Again, I [had] already chosen what I wanted to do for a living but [this] story touched me so deeply.Here’s a guy who makes comedies during the Depression and he’s so isolated in Hollywood [that] he sets out to learn what’s going on with people. He becomes a hobo. And he ends up way in the South and [is] put into this work prison. And everyone in Hollywood believes that he’s dead, that a hobo stole his coat and was killed by a train. And so he’s there and [he can’t] get word back that he’s still alive. It’s a horrible situation. For Christmas Eve, at the depth of his misery, a black church in the segregated South invites all the prisoners out. And they sit there and what they watch is a Pluto cartoon. It’s the famous scene of Pluto getting the flypaper stuck on him and he can’t get it off. And [the audience] starts howling with laughter. Howling with laughter. People who you wouldn’t think would still have laughter in their bodies. And Sullivan came out of this and gets back to Hollywood and everyone’s like, “Oh, you had this horrible situation, you must make a great drama.” And he goes, “No, I’m going to make a comedy. Because that’s what the world needs.”Bonus short: A Bear forPunishmentMr.Deeds Goes to Town &nbsp;(1936, 93% Tomatometer)This is between Frank Capra’s It’s a Wonderful Life andMr. Deeds Goes to Town. Hmm, I’m going to go with Mr. Deeds. Gary Cooper, Jean Arthur. It’s just an amazing film. It’s very funny. Longfellow Deeds is the main character, Gary Cooper plays him and he’s so appealing. I think it’s the definition of appeal.So Longfellow Deeds is this guy who lives in this tiny town, he’s makes a living writing greeting cards. Just a sweet guy. There’s a distant relative who’s this gigantic millionaire. Has a huge fortune. So this industrialist dies in New York City and they trace [him] down, he’s the only heir to this huge fortune. So they bring him to New York and now he runs this company. [But] this really ace reporter for the local paper wants to get the dirt on him, and [she’s played by] Jean Arthur. So she waits for him to come out and she acts like she’s starving, like she’s a homeless woman during the Depression. So he picks her up and feeds her some food and they start doing things together. And he absolutely falls in love with her. But, so, there’s all this dirt that’s coming out in the newspapers and they don’t know how it’s happening. But the scene…it starts very funny, but, again, it’s that heart, it’s balancing humor and heart that Frank Capra did so well, the scene in which he finds out the woman he’s fallen in love with is actually the one who’s doing all the dirt is one of the most emotional scenes in the film. And it’s so underplayed. So beautifully underplayed. He gets behind this column but you know he’s crying. And he can’t bear anyone to see him. It’s so incredibly moving and touching.Bonus short: Rabbit ofSevilleThe General (1927,91% Tomatometer)I’m going to choose Buster Keaton’s Steamboat Bill Jr. Itwas either Steamboat Bill Jr. or The General. You know, let me change it toTheGeneral. Love the train. Anyways, Steamboat Bill Jr.-slash-The General. It’sabout Buster Keaton. He was one of the great inspirations in my career, mylife, in studying his works. He’s like a human cartoon character. But, moreimportantly, he developed character and personality. These films are soappealing because of the personality of the characters he created. His comictiming is staggering.Bonus short: Zoom and BoredCheck out more info on John Lasseterhere, and view pictures and trailers fromBolt.

Ortega/Getty Images)You may not know it, but you’ve seen Doug Jones‘ work. One of the best physical actors in Hollywood, he has performed under heavy make-up and special effects as the Silver Surfer in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, the “Gentlemen” on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and gave life to both The Faun and the Pale Man in Guillermo del Toro‘s Oscar-winning horror-fairytale, Pan’s Labyrinth, as well as Abe Sapien in del Toro’s&nbsp;Hellboy movies.We spoke with Doug Jones about his work under prosthetics, his close relationship with Guillermo del Toro, and his battle to win Abe Sapien’s voice back from David Hyde Pierce (who, as the story goes, graciously deferred vocal credit in the first Hellboy after seeing Jones’ own performance). And after playing every fantastical creature from robots to aliens to yetis, Jones told us what his dream role would be — and how he and del Toro may already be planning to bring it to the screen.But first, Jones took time to share his favorite films of all time with Rotten Tomatoes. Read on for more!Somewhere in Time (1980)  61%I have favorite chick flicks and favorite comedies. My taste goes to romantic comedy a lot. Somewhere in Time, with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour — stop already! That was one of the most romantic stories I’d ever seen in my life; I was in tears, but it also involved a little bit of science fiction, with the time travel element. That one really moved me back in 1980.Airplane! (1980)  97%Also, the very first Airplane! movie, with that zany comedy, slapstick-y, sight gag thing going on. I’d never seen a movie like that before. Of course, after that came more Airplanes and Hot Shots, Top Secret, and the Naked Gun movies. But Airplane took me so by surprise, and Leslie Nielsen was brilliant.RT: Surely, Airplane is one of the best spoof movies ever made.Well it is, and stop calling me Shirley!Meet Joe Black (1998)  45%Coming up to more recent years, I think Meet Joe Black, again, was a tear-jerky chick flick for me that I loved. And the performances…&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins can do no wrong, Brad Pitt‘s become a favorite as well, and Claire Forlani — stop already! All that girl has to do is blink and I’m enraptured. And that was another romance with a sci-fi twist; death coming to take a holiday.Waiting for Guffman (1996)  91%What else? Waiting for Guffman! Stop already, right? Christopher Guest and all of his tomfoolery. Of course, there was Spinal Tap, but in more recent years…I think the storyline of [Guffman] was so relatable to any actor who’s ever done community theater in their hometown. Here were all these egos, in a small town, where it just didn’t matter. I come from Indiana, and when you’re doing stage productions in high school, or in your community theater, or on the college stage, you think you’re Broadway bound, for sure. You’re all going to be stars! It’s delusional theater, is what it is. But that whole cast of people, having their basic storyline, and then vamping on their own brilliance, was just golden. Just golden.Waking Ned Devine (1998)  84%Waking Ned Devine. Loved it. There’s something about aged, experienced, mature people acting like kids. This whole town bands together to pull a ruse, to win a lottery ticket and split lottery ticket winnings; it was kind of morally wrong, and yet also giddy and made you clap your hands and say, “Go you guys, go!”Jen Yamato for Rotten Tomatoes: Your Five Favorite Films are interesting because they seem to speak to you as an actor’s actor, not just a creature actor. You’ve not only done great creature work in films like Pan’s Labyrinth and Hellboy, you also play regular characters. Has it been strange to become known for your work under prosthetics as opposed to the latter?Doug Jones: Thank you. It’s very kind of you to notice that. If you asked me this a few years ago, I might have said that the day would come where I’m not wearing prosthetics anymore and I’m just doing straight acting roles. But you know what I think I’ve learned in the last couple years especially, is that with a little bit more recognition, a certain respect and dignity has returned to these kinds of roles — monsters with a heart. It’s a throwback to the Golden Era, when you had Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney doing these roles that were leading men in their own little creature-y, freaky little way. Directors like Guillermo del Toro (pictured at left with Jones at the Hellboy II premiere), who like to tell that kind of story, take you to a fantastical world but deal with real human issues when they get there. That’s brought a certain, like I said, respect and dignity to this kind of story and this kind of acting, so that I’m now happy to continue it until the day I die. In fact, I’ll tell you the perfect way for me to die. You want to hear it? I think if I’m on a Guillermo del Toro film — and I want to finish it for him, I don’t want to leave him hanging — and my last day, when they yell, “It’s a wrap on Doug Jones,” that’s how I want to die. That’s the perfect way for me to go.RT: That’s really sweet. It speaks to the bond that you and Guillermo have obviously formed by working together.Jones: We definitely do have a sort of shorthand with each other, and a respect for each other, and an actor-director relationship that really works and doesn’t need a whole lot of dialogue. We understand each other with very few words.RT: Speaking of words, let’s talk about how you came to voice your character, Abe Sapien, in Hellboy II. We know that David Hyde Pierce, who voiced Abe in the first Hellboy while you did the physical acting, had such tremendous respect for your performance in that film that he had his credit removed.Jones: He’s a gentleman beyond words. And in an ego-driven business like ours it’s unheard of for an actor to do what David Hyde Pierce did. The more questionable thing is, how did it come about that someone was voiced over like that in the first place? When presented with an acting role, any actor assumes they’re taking on the character, and that would include all of it — it would include the visuals and the audio part and everything. I don’t walk down the street doing half of Doug Jones! I walk into a 7-11 and I get to order for myself. So originally it was kind of like, you’ve got this major make-up, and you’ve got A-list celebrities that probably don’t want to don that much make-up and be obliterated in the face, so the studio was thinking, we’ll get someone to physically pull it off, and we’ll get an A-list name that we can market with the film that’ll provide the voice, and there you go. We can attach a name to the part without gruesome amounts of make-up on that person. When I heard that that’s what the plan was — that was already decided by the time I was cast — I said, hey, how about we don’t do that? How about I get to do the part, as I’d play any part? So I was given the opportunity to be one of the voices being considered, but at the time Doug Jones didn’t carry a lot of weight as a name, as a marketing tool.In the end, everyone was happy with my performance, and I was kind of directed even to sound like… Guillermo wanted me to sound a little bit like Niles Crane from Frasier, with a little bit of HAL the computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey. So I kind of affected a sound for Abe that wasn’t far from David Hyde Pierce anyway. He, being the gentleman that he is, heard my performance in his ear piece when he came in to voice-over, and he saw my performance on film, and he kind of backed away saying, “Why am I here?” It was one of those things where he, as legend goes, was very much a gentleman that backed away from taking a credit in the film and doing any press, and doing any limelight-type things, and he left that all to me. Which was very, very, very sweet and kind of him.So that continued through to the animated features, when he was offered the voice of Abe Sapien, and he politely declined. And that’s when they just deferred to me immediately. Part of the discussion that Guillermo had with me, when he told me about the first film and what happened with the voice, was he said, “If we get the blessing and the opportunity to do a Hellboy II, I would like to have your voice back in it.” So this animated feature was a nice transitional period to do that in, and by the time Hellboy II came around, I was assured and promised that the voice would stay intact as mine. I love David Hyde Pierce, I think he’s a wonderful actor, but it really is nice to have that whole baby, in its entirety, back in my hands again. Before I was kind of holding a baby without legs [Laughs].RT: In Hellboy II, Abe has a considerably large storyline; was that borne of fan love of Abe from the first movie, and will that prominence carry over to the third movie?Jones: Yes, and yes. And I believe it’s also borne of Guillermo del Toro’s love for Abe Sapien. I’ll share a little moment with you from the set. We were doing the scene in the library, when Abe and the lovely Princess Nuala are getting to know each other over a book of poetry. There was this backlight that shined and hit my gills, and Guillermo said to me, before we rolled on the next take, “There’s something about the way the light shines on Abe’s gills that just makes my heart flutter.” That was one way of him expressing his absolute adoration for Abe Sapien. So, yes; I think there was a resounding cry from the fans for more Abe in the second film, and there was a desire in Guillermo all along to build on Abe as well.RT: Your work as the Faun and the Pale Man in Pan’s Labyrinth was well-received. Again in Hellboy II, you played three different characters.Jones: I was Abe, and the Angel of Death, and the Chamberlain; those are my three. The Chamberlain is the doorkeeper for the king of the elven underworld — he’s a sad looking fellow, isn’t he?RT: These characters even seem to have some resemblance to those you played in Pan’s Labyrinth.Jones: It was the same creature designers as the first Hellboy, Spectral Motion. They’re also the ones who made me up as the Silver Surfer [in Fantastic Four 2]. The Pan’s Labyrinth people were DDT Effectos Especiales in Barcelona. In Hellboy II they did design and apply the make-up for young Hellboy. Hellboy II had so many creatures in it, they pulled in a lot of shops, but the main characters were by Spectral Motion — Hellboy, and Abe, and the Angel of Death and such.RT: One last question: If you could play any creature from mythology or lore that we haven’t seen yet onscreen, what would it be?Jones:&nbsp;Actually, there’s been some talk recently that really intrigued me, about doing Frankenstein. That’s something I had never thought of because he’s rather large and lumbering in the imagery that you’ve seen of him before. However, there are new art concepts that Guillermo has seen, and the idea of doing Frankenstein with a thinner, more soulful kind of monster in Frankenstein could be something really delicious to chew on.Guillermo was asked about this recently, on the red carpet of the Hellboy II premiere. [ShockTilYouDrop‘s Ryan Rotten got the scoop.] A journalist got to him first and asked, “Hey Guillermo, if you did Frankenstein, who would the monster be?” And Guillermo said, a resounding “Doug Jones” — which seems like an alternative choice to what you’ve seen before, but there’s a certain type of artwork that he’s seen of Frankenstein and that’s what interested him. The journalist got to me next and said, “Hey, guess what I just heard Guillermo say?” I was like, “Oh, you’re kidding!” I went onto DelToro films, which is his website, and there’s a message board that the fans talk on, and somebody on a thread for fan art submitted a piece of art of a Frankenstein built on Doug Jones. The artist’s screen name is Riddick, so that’s how you can find it. (Click here for a full view of the art. Conception and design courtesy of the artist, Alex Tuis.) There’s a drawing in there that is based on me that is a Frankenstein that I would kill to play. Looking at that imagery, and having Guillermo as a director, and knowing Frankenstein’s sympathetic side and his scary side — I love characters like that that are sympathetic and yet scary at the same time — that could become a dream role for me. Absolutely.RT: It seems like if Guillermo’s in for a project, you’re in.Jones:&nbsp;As he said, [in his best Guillermo del Toro voice] “Listen, if I direct a hemorrhoid commercial, Doug Jones will be in it.” And I feel the same way. If he’s directing a hemorrhoid commercial, I’ll play the frickin’ hemorrhoid. He’ll find a way to make it artful; I know he will.The Shape of Water&nbsp;is in theaters in limited release this Friday, December 1.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Winners, halloween, Reality, Emmys, Food, indiana, japanese, Musicals, Amazon","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/28104226/Doug-Jones-FFF-rep.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-hellboy-iis-doug-jones"},{"id":"47508867403239","title":"Five Favorite Films with David S.

GoyerThe writer/director of The Unborn also talks dybbuks, twins and Jewish mysticism.by Jen Yamato | January 5, 2009 |  CommentsWriter/director David S. Goyer (Batman Begins, the Blade trilogy) has held close associations to the comic book genre — he’s currently awaiting the green light on his script for X-Men Origins: Magneto — but took a break from adapting superhero tales to write and direct an original horror story. The result is this week’s The Unborn, a PG-13 supernatural thriller about a doe eyed co-ed named Casey (Cloverfield‘s Odette Yustman) haunted by an ancient Jewish dybbuk, or demon.Unlike many contemporary horror films, The Unborn opts for old-fashioned suspense over gore and treads ground rare for its genre; twin studies, Nazi experimentation, Jewish mysticism and even the abortion debate pop up thematically throughout Goyer’s tale, which also stars Meagan Good, Gary Oldman, and Cam Gigandet.Rotten Tomatoes spoke with Goyer about his other extra-cinematic influences, how he developed The Unborn through his own personal fascinations, and whether or not the film is meant to spark the pro-life vs. pro-choice debate. He also shared his Five Favorite Films, noting that his choices are ever-changing and perhaps surprising. “Those aren’t necessarily the kinds of films I might make,” Goyer explained. “But that’s okay — I think people are more complex. We’re not just little sound bites.”&nbsp;The Man Who Would Be King (1975, 100% Tomatometer)Well, my favorite film of all time, period, is The Man Who Would Be King. John Huston, you know, based on the Rudyard Kipling story. Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer. First of all, I love Connery and Caine, and John Huston is probably my favorite old-time director, and I just love that movie from start to finish. I love everything about it — I can never get enough of it. It’s epic adventure, and I love the rogueish relationship between Connery and Caine’s characters. I think I was 13 or 14 when I first saw it. I watch it probably once a year — I love it.Being There (1979, 97% Tomatometer)Another one is Being There. Hal Ashby — that’s finally coming out on Blu-ray and DVD, so I’m very excited about that. That movie, I think, is just a really lovely, amazing movie. Peter Sellers‘ best movie by far, and Hal Ashby’s best, in my opinion. I think it’s just terribly funny and terribly touching, and…I don’t know. I love that movie.28 Days Later (2003, 88% Tomatometer)What else? 28 Days Later is one of my favorite movies — a horror film. Danny Boyle is probably my favorite director. I just loved how ballsy 28 Days Later was, from start to finish. He’s fearless, he’ll do any genre — “Fine, I’m going to do a zombie movie” — and just smack you in the face with it.Pan’s Labyrinth (2006, 96% Tomatometer)Pan’s Labyrinth is one of my top five. That’s just a perfect movie, a beautiful movie, and I thought it absolutely deserved to win Best Foreign Film until I saw The Lives of Others.Rotten Tomatoes: Pan’s Labyrinth was made by Guillermo del Toro, who you’ve worked with. Were you able to see it before it came out?David Goyer: I just saw some artwork. He showed me some of his journals where he sketches, and told me a little over dinner one time, a year or so before he made it, but it’s kind of an impossible film to describe. I think everything he does is interesting, but it was hard to visualize until I’d seen it.The Lives of Others (2006, 93%)I couldn’t believe I hadn’t seen it, and among recent movies, it’s probably in my top five as well. I couldn’t believe Pan’s Labyrinth got shut out, and then I saw The Lives of Others and was floored. I bawled like a baby at the end of that movie. Just staggering.Next: Goyer discusses his influences outside of film and how his creative process took him from twins to Nazi science to demons and beyond…[rtimage]MapID=1202166&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=8&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Rotten Tomatoes: You’re known for your love of comic books, and how it’s influenced your filmmaking, but I’m sure that’s not the only medium you love.David Goyer: Oh, no. I still read comic books, but they aren’t the only things. I’m a voracious reader.RT: What other kinds of art influence you?DG: Well, I like documentary filmmaking very much — I’m a big fan of that. Photography, modern art, things like that — I love to travel, so I like historical and cultural art. Just last year, I went to Vietnam and Cambodia for about five weeks and immersed myself in that world. In college, I minored in poetry, so I pull from all over the place.RT: One of the most striking aspects of The Unborn is how detailed it is, and how it delves into areas like Jewish mysticism, religion, and other layered themes that are developed.DG: Well, I like even my genre movies to have a lot of historical underpinnings and research. There’s probably a lot more in there than you might realize. I hope it catches that air of authenticity — at least it helps me when I’m writing. So even if the imagery isn’t explicitly stated, a lot of the imagery comes from [historical research] — like the dream where she’s on the ceiling and looking down on herself, that comes from the idea that in olden days, Jewish people believed that their souls would go wandering while they were sleeping, so when they woke up, they’d say a prayer like Jane Alexander does in the movie for being thankful that nothing sort of unwelcome inhabited their body while their souls were out wandering. So the imagery of that dream comes from that, and obviously there’s the subtext of this thing crawling into [Casey’s] womb…[rtimage]MapID=1202166&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: It seems that a lot of what you explore in this movie comes from your own deep personal interests, such as the fascination with twins.DG: Sure.RT: Was it the same with Jewish folklore?DG: You know, it’s not like I was steeped in Jewish folklore. It started with the idea of the twins first, and that led me to researching heterochromia — the changing of the color of the iris — which is the condition that the lead character suffers from in the film, and that led me to the experiments that Dr. Mengele was doing in Auschwitz, which coincidentally also had to do with twins. That led me to the legend of the dybbuk, which in turn led me to all the imagery of the mirrors. So it wasn’t like I started off thinking I was going to make a movie about Jewish mysticism. I just kind of started with an idea, and started doing research, and let myself wander. One by one, the elements just sort of fell into place with one another. I was trying to see if I could kind of craft a new legend, at least filmically, because I don’t know that anyone had done a dybbuk story before, and it’s a different take on possession and exorcism. Ironically, most people’s perceptions of exorcism come from the Friedkin film, of course, but the tradition dates back five or six thousand years and actually originated in the Jewish faith, long before it started in the Christian or Catholic faith.Next: On dybbuks, Holocaust guilt, and whether or not The Unborn overtly addresses the abortion debate….[rtimage]MapID=1202166&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: Your characters talk about how the idea of demons —DG: Predates organized religion. Well, they would. I always thought it was funny that you’d hold up a cross and Dracula would shy away from it, because it seems to me that evil isn’t Jewish or Muslim or Christian. In fact, I had a character say that in the film.RT: There’s also the idea in the movie that younger generations are detached from their heritage, that Casey not only doesn’t practice the Jewish faith but also is unaware of the dybbuk that has cursed her family for generations.DG: Well, it’s a subtext. They’re detached from their lineage, they’re detached from their heritage, they’re detached from their families, and that makes them more vulnerable, because there’s not as much of a sense of community. It’s all subtext, but it’s in there, yeah. Absolutely.RT: What about Holocaust survivor’s guilt, and the idea that Casey now becomes responsible for setting right things that began so long ago?DG: Well, I could make a joke about Jewish guilt, but yeah, that’s in there a little bit too. The grandmother has survivor’s guilt, and she unintentionally passes it along to her daughter, who does the same to her granddaughter. I think there’s this sense that in reality, whether it’s genetics or learned behavior, that generations tend to pass these things on to successive generations, and whether we know it or not, we’re often dealing with things that happened three or four generations prior to us. Hopefully, people will watch the movie and it’ll make them think about these things in different ways.[rtimage]MapID=1202166&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: Another underlying theme that persisted for me was the question of whether this is a pro-life or pro-choice film.DG: It isn’t meant to be either. I mean, you know, it’s funny that a very small percentage of the audience when we were testing it — we’re talking three or four people out of 500 — would say either “this is a pro-choice film” or “this is a pro-life film.” It’s not really either, and I don’t mean to make an overt political statement there. Obviously, people are going to imbue it with whatever their specific belief is, but in the same way, some people were saying that The Dark Knight was a Republican apology, and some were saying it was an anti-Bush film. Both sides were sort of claiming it for their own.RT: Well, I think you’re in the clear, because at different times I thought it could possibly be either a pro-life or a pro-choice film.DG: I try to walk that very thin line, so good.For the latest reviews, trailers, and news for The Unborn, click here.Want more Five Favorite Films?

See what films Paris loves!by Jen Yamato | October 1, 2008 |  CommentsSinger, actress, businesswoman…rock opera star? Paris Hilton has worn many hats during her reign as America’s most famous celebutante, but her most unexpected role is about to come. As a spoiled rich girl with a dangerous plastic surgery addiction in Darren Lynn Bousman‘s grand, Gothic rock opus Repo! The Genetic Opera, Hilton is surprising critics by taking more than a few jabs at herself — by playing a character some might call the Paris Hilton of Repo!Rotten Tomatoes caught up with Hilton at the soundtrack release party for Repo! The Genetic Opera, which debuts in theaters November 7. Read on for the latest installment of Five Favorite Films with Paris Hilton!There’s Something About Mary (1998, 81% Tomatometer)I love There’s Something About Mary. I love Ben Stiller, I think he’s hilarious, so funny. I love Cameron Diaz — she’s so beautiful, and such a great actress. I love the Farrelly brothers. They’re so talented. They have the craziest, sickest humor but I love it.Moulin Rouge (2001, 78% Tomatometer)And Moulin Rouge — I love musicals, and I love the music in that. I have it all memorized, I’ve seen that movie twenty times. It’s so beautiful, and I love the makeup and the costumes. The story is so sad.Beaches (1988, 27% Tomatometer)I love Beaches. I love that movie! It’s so sad, but it’s really a story about best friends. I don’t know, it’s a classic, and I grew up with it. And it has really great music.Edward Scissorhands (1990, 91% Tomatometer)I love Johnny Depp — he’s an amazing actor, and I love the characters he picks. And it’s just a really cute story. And I love the director [Tim Burton].Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961, 86% Tomatometer)And I love Breakfast at Tiffany’s. I love Audrey Hepburn. I love her style, and I think the whole idea of it is really fun, because I used to live in New York so I can relate to her.Our interview with Paris Hilton continues as we discuss her role in Repo! The Genetic Opera, how her intensive singing for the role inspired her new album, and her dream role as an actress.You’re here because you have a role in Darren Bousman’s film, Repo! The Genetic Opera, which seems to be kind of an unusual choice for you. What kind of roles are you usually offered, and why did you choose to venture into this Goth rock opera?Paris Hilton: I’m always offered basically to play myself, or another blond role, so it’s hard to really do anything with it, because it’s like, you know, whatever. So I was really honored and excited when I got the call from Darren about it because I love all the Saw movies. The fact that I was being offered such a different role was really exciting for me, and I wanted to show people that I can do a lot more than what I’ve been offered.I remember hearing Darren talk about how impressed they were at your auditions by your singing.PH: Yeah, auditions were a lot of fun. I’m so excited I got the part! I really worked hard with my voice coach; this was completely different from my last album. The music was hardcore, so I really had to train. Doing those exercises really helps, they really built up my voice. I was excited to do another album so I set up a recording studio at my house, did a whole album this summer, wrote all the songs…so that’s coming out next month.What kind of album will this be?PH:A lot of the songs are very tongue-in-cheek, like I’m joking around and making fun of my image a little bit. And then some songs are more serious, some are love songs, anthem kind of songs.Acting-wise, what are your goals?PH:Well, people have been seeing Repo and giving great reviews, so I’ve been getting many offers and calls to do a lot. I’d like to play a total nerd, I think that would be fun.&nbsp;Want more 5 Favorite Films?

You just tuck your tail betweenyour legs and you walk away.”So Cook loves his upcoming movie (opening this Friday), in which he co-starswith Jason Biggs, Kate Hudson, and Alec Baldwin as a jackass-for-hire whotakes women on legendarily bad dates and sends them running back to theirexes. What are the other movies the comedian/actor loves, namely his fivefavorite of all time? RT puts Cook under the spotlight.Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (1987, 97% Tomatometer)I know three right off the bat.Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. How’d it influence me? Big Steve Martin fan. Knew I wanted to be a comedian when I was very young. And my sister brought the Wild and Crazy Guy album home, which I still have in my office. WhenPlanes, Trains came out, that was the first film that really I looked at and said, “I’d love to, someday if I’m lucky enough to have a comedy audience, bring them into film and make that kind of movie.” Big heart, big laughs. And, of course, Steve Martin at the car rental shop, you know, “I want my f–king car right f–king now.” Unbelievably funny movie. Of course, John Hughes, John Candy, one of my favorites ever.Can I take two minutes to tell a story? Awesome f–king John Hughes story. [My Best Friend’s Girl director] Howie [Deutch] was directingSome Kind of Wonderful and the studio wanted a four-page rewrite on a scene. So Howie’s all, “I can’t figure out what to do.” Calls John, says, “Can you come over and help me write these four pages?” For two-and-a-half hours they’re just pacing around, John is just smoking incessantly. Howie says, “I need to lay down. I’m beat. I’m going to sleep a few hours and then we’ll finish it.” Then he says, “Dane, I wake up at about five in the morning and John is scribbling like crazy. He hands it to me and says, ‘Read this. It’s only 50 pages right now, but read it. I’m calling itFerris Bueller’s Day Off.’The EmpireStrikes Back (1980, 97% Tomatometer)Absolutely blown away by the world ofStar Wars, Empire and Jedis. [But] my favorite moment of the three is actually inThe Return of the Jedi. And I argue this with people who are real Star Wars freaks. “Ewoks ruin the movie.” If you’re going to trifle over Ewoks, and you’re not going to talk about how great the speeder bike scenes through the redwood forests are, then f–k off. Those are some of the greatest action sequences… Okay, yeah, there’s some cute critters to sell merchandise. [But there’s] some [scenes] that I couldn’t even dream up with these unbelievable hovercrafts and modern-looking Stormtrooopers.And Jedi has the best moment. [It’s] at the very end when the Emperor is trying to pull Luke over and, of course, Luke is getting the s–t kicked out of him and getting electricity blown at him. And Luke finally takes his lightsaber and throws it aside and says, “No. I’ll never join you. I’m a Jedi like my father before me.” And the Emperor says, “So be it…Jedi.” And it was the fact that the f–king devil himself gave Luke props and called him by [who] he was. It empowered him. That always gets by people, but that’s my stand-out moment.But Empire, when that movie ended in a cliffhanger, my life was a cliffhanger. Until the next one came out, you couldn’t talk to me, you couldn’t talk to me, dude. I was hanging out with my Ungnaught action figures. Everything in my life went back to, “What do you think is going to happen next to Han Solo?” I promise you, you talk to my family and they will go, “Dane was bananas.”Goodfellas (1990,96% Tomatometer)Goodfellas is a movie that you can watch a million times in a row and there’s always a scene where you go, “Whoa, wait a minute, is this another director’s cut. Where did that scene come from? When did that scene get so amazing?” Just a classic. Love Scorsese. But this movie to me is just the cream of the crop when it comes to dramas.The Dark Knight (2008,95% Tomatometer)I’m going to put this on the list. It’s a new movie. It’s a movie that’s making history. It’s one of the greatest crime dramas out there. And when Kevin Smith lovingly compared it toGodfather II, it was before I had seen the movie and I thought, “Okay, this is jumping the shark. Kevin Smith, if I see him, I want to punch in the mouth. Because he has taken the hype machine and he’s cranked it up to 11 viaSpinal Tap.” And I was unhappy with [his] statement.Now that I’ve sat through the movie, I want to French kiss Kevin Smith. He f–king nailed it. And this movie,The Dark Knight, it deserves the money its making. It’s epic, it’s classic, Heath Ledger would be amazing whether it was a posthumous performance, whatever. He’s awesome in it. I. Love. This. Movie.Halloween (1978,90% Tomatometer)Let me really rattle my brain here. I want to go back. I’m going to say Halloween. When Mike Myers walks out of the backyard… It’s an establishing shot of the front of the house, and you think it’s just a standard exterior, night, Halloween, porch. [But] then the music goes [imitates Halloween theme]. And then [Myers] walks out of the shadow of the backyard. I, to this day, don’t look into a shadowy night yard situation without seeing him walk out.The same way that when I’m in a very sudsy bathtub — and, yes, I do take baths, don’t judge me — when my f–king toe comes out of the water — my number six pick would beJaws — I still look at my toe and I still become frightened of Amity Beach and all the things that happened to the poor people in the Steven Spielberg epic.I grew up in a family that loved film, loved music, loved comedy. Thirsty for the how-to’s. Some kids liked to take apart radios. I wanted to know how Johnny Carson set up punch. I wanted to know how Burt Reynolds jumped over the bridge inCannonball Run. I really have a love of film. And although I wanted to be a comedian primarily, I certainly wanted to, with a smidgen of success, be behind the camera andlive that incredible world.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Channel, Stephen, Opinion, street, elm, south, all-time, Peacock, Cannes","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/DaneCook.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-dane-cook"},{"id":"47508867414509","title":"Five Favorite Films with Twilight‘s Robert Pattinson","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Twilight's Robert PattinsonOur (mostly) artful conversation with the 22-year-old British actor.by Jen Yamato | November 18, 2008 |  CommentsThanks to a teen phenomenon called Twilight, Robert Pattinson has gone from being a little-known Brit actor (best known as the handsome, ill-fated Cedric Diggory in two Harry Potter films) to having his face plastered across every major magazine, television show, and website known to man. Or at least, every one of them known to teenage girls. This Friday, thousands of Pattinson’s admiring fans will have the pleasure of finally watching the teen vampire romance that has launched their favorite new teen idol into the stratosphere, as he stars opposite Kristen Stewart as Edward Cullen, the dreamiest undead boyfriend of the year in Catherine Hardwicke‘s (Thirteen, Lords of Dogtown) adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s best-selling novel.But there’s more than Tiger Beat fodder to the 22-year-old actor; after the Twilight frenzy peaks this week (with fans and Summit Entertainment suits crossing their fingers for a breakout box office to justify a multi-sequel franchise) Pattinson will appear next March as a young Salvador Dali in Little Ashes (click for images)– a period piece that might test the ardor of Pattinson’s Twilight fan base — and the indie outsider pic How to Be, which will likely pick up distribution in the wake of Twilight. Pattinson’s artful leanings came out in a conversation with Rotten Tomatoes about his favorite films of all time, which span such cinematic luminaries as Jack Nicholson, Jean-Luc Godard, and…Chris Kattan?Read on for Five Favorite Films with Twilight‘s Robert Pattinson.One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975, 98% Tomatometer)The films that I like aren’t necessarily because they’re good films in themselves — One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is a good film — but that one specifically meant a lot to me. Not because I was in a mental home or anything, but that character influenced me so much when I was 15 or 16, and bits of it stuck with me. A lot of that kind of “putting your middle finger up to the world” attitude — not that I really have that, but…I used to be so timid, and that was one of those films that [helped me break out], by pretending to be [Jack Nicholson’s character] Randle.The Exorcist (1973, 85% Tomatometer)The Exorcist, because I love Linda Blair. [Laughs] She’s my ideal woman.Prenom Carmen (First Name: Carmen) (1983, 88% Tomatometer)What else do I like? A Godard film called Prenom Carmen, which sounds like I’m just saying that to be cool, but it’s actually one of my favorite films. I think it’s the best Godard film. It’s like his version of Carmen the opera, one of his films from the eighties. In terms of just pure filmmaking and manipulating an audience, it kind of starts out as a farce, as a complete, stupid farce, with this bank robbery; but it’s really, really…Godardian, with kind of a stupid humor that’s so random. Only he could make it, mixed up with these kinds of philosophical elements.It starts out with one of these bank robbers, these students, and she starts to sleep with one of the guards; she’s having sex with him in the bank, and he pretends to arrest her and they run away together. And he wants to be part of her gang. It’s all so completely ridiculous. And then suddenly, halfway through, it turns into the most heartbreaking, serious thing that you’ve ever seen — out of nowhere! — and you’re suddenly so attached to these characters, which you weren’t before, because it seemed like a stupid student film. They have this secondary story where they have a string quartet playing the soundtrack which runs in the other story, but they film them during rehearsal, just doing really close up things with them playing cello and stuff, and it’s about the relationship with the conductor and this girl, the cellist — and it’s completely random to the film, but it’s incredible.Continuing on the subject of Godard…I love the last line of Breathless — it’s literally one of the best [representations] of the relationship between women and men. He was also very aware of how people viewed his films, and that film in particular. Everyone was thinking, oh, I’m cool, because I like this, and it’s like, “What does ‘bitch’ mean?” [Laughs] That’s kind of the conflict. I love that.Breathless is definitely what got me into Godard. You can’t really be influenced by Jean-Paul Belmondo though, because he’s too cool — so there’s no point in me trying to be like him! Randle McMurphy, you can kind of wear his clothes. [Laughs] It’s quite easy to find them. But if you wore Belmondo’s clothes, you’d look like an idiot.But even he’s trying to be someone else — he’s trying to be Bogart.He’s not really — he’s cooler than Bogart! [Pattinson imitates Belmondo’s signature move, brushing his thumb over his lips.] That’s like the coolest thing! Another film, Pierrot le Fou — I did everything from those movies. These stupid, random things, like when he says, “Can I get two beers?” And she’s like, “Why?” “I want to have one when I finish the other one.” I was like, that’s so cool! I have to do that all the time! There’s this stupid thing from Arizona Dream, with Vincent Gallo and Johnny Depp, where Vincent Gallo does this thing, [in Gallo’s American accent] “Two shots, two beers.” So every time I buy drinks, I go “Two shots, two beers!” I love that film so much.Corky Romano (2001, 5% Tomatometer)Corky Romano. I love that film. Literally, that’s one of the only films I’ve pissed my pants at. Like, I actually pissed my pants. The first time I was in L.A. I was watching it on TV. The scene where he’s on coke…was literally the only thing that they advertised, it was like the only point of the whole movie! I love that character. I love how Chris Kattan just stripped his whole career in one movie. The only guy off Saturday Night Live who just messed it up! It’s like, what happened? The only guy. That’s why I think it’s so great.I also love the behind-the-scenes stuff on the DVD where none of the crew are laughing; the director’s [hiding] and he’s telling Chris Kattan, “Just do something funny, just make Chris Penn laugh,” and none of the crew think it’s funny at all. And you can tell Chris Kattan is just freaking out. Also, he had that vein, which I have [Pattinson points to his forehead] which pops out of his head. I can really relate to him.ivan’s xtc. (2002, 75% Tomatometer)A film called ivan’s xtc. It’s a Danny Huston film. That’s what I’ve been watching obsessively recently. It’s amazing; Danny Huston should have gotten nominated for an Oscar for it. It’s about an agent in Hollywood, and it’s kind of a dumb movie before Huston comes in, and then literally is the best example of one performance elevating a movie. It was shot on digital video; it’s all improvised. Just having him there, he’s literally this — I don’t know, I can’t even describe it. I’ve never seen a performance like it. He’s flawless. And if you’ve ever met an agent, ever…Check out more info on Robert Pattinson here, and view pictures and trailers from Twilight.

It’s joined by the comic book-themed Utopia&nbsp;as the streaming service’s TV debuts of September.The service is also the new home of Daniel Craig’s Bond debut Casino Royale, both Sex and the City movies, plus a slew of&nbsp; ’70s hits including Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Kramer Vs. Kramer, The Graduate,&nbsp;and In The Mechanic.Keep reading to find out what else is new on Amazon Prime Video in September, including new on-demand titles like Antebellum and Guest House, with some highlights noted at the top.HIGHLIGHTSThe Boys: Season 2 (2020)  97%Description:&nbsp;On the run from the law and hunted by the Supes, the Boys desperately try to regroup and fight back against Vought. Meanwhile, Starlight must navigate her place in The Seven as Homelander sets his sights on taking complete control. His power is threatened with the addition of Stormfront, who has an agenda of her own. On top of that, the Supervillain threat takes center stage and makes waves as Vought seeks to capitalize on the nation’s paranoia.Premiere Date:&nbsp;Sept. 4Utopia: Season 1 (2020)  50%Description:&nbsp;Utopia is a conspiracy thriller that follows a group of young fans who come together when they discover that the conspiracy in an elusive comic, Utopia, is real. The comic foretells the demise of humanity and the world as we know it, thrusting this group of underdogs to embark on a high-stakes twisted adventure to use what they uncover to save themselves, each other and ultimately humanity.Premiere Date:&nbsp;Sept.&nbsp;25Casino Royale (2006)  94%Description:&nbsp;James Bond’s first 007 mission takes him to Madagascar, where he is to spy on a terrorist Mollaka. Not everything goes as planned and Bond decides to investigate, independently of the MI6 agency, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend, Solange. He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the world’s terrorist organizations. Secret Service intelligence reveals that Le Chiffre is planning to raise money in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6 assigns 007 to play against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses, it will destroy his organization. ‘M’ places Bond under the watchful eye of the beguiling Vesper Lynd. At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond’s interest in her deepens as they brave danger together–and even torture at the hands of Le Chiffre. In Montenegro, Bond allies himself with Matthis, MI6’s local field agent, and Felix Leiter, who is representing the interests of the CIA. The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence, raising the stakes beyond blood money and reaching a terrifying climax.Critics Consensus:&nbsp;Casino Royale disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for: a caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007.Premiere Date:&nbsp;Sept. 1Judy (2019)  81%Description: Winter 1968 and showbiz legend Judy Garland arrives in Swinging London to perform a five-week sold-out run at The Talk of the Town. It is 30 years since she shot to global stardom in The Wizard of Oz, but if her voice has weakened, its dramatic intensity has only grown. As she prepares for the show, battles with management, charms musicians and reminisces with friends and adoring fans, her wit and warmth shine through. Even her dreams of love seem undimmed as she embarks on a whirlwind romance with Mickey Deans, her soon-to-be fifth husband. Featuring some of her best-known songs, the film celebrates the voice, the capacity for love, and the sheer pizzazz of “the world’s greatest entertainer.”Critics Consensus: Led by a deeply committed performance from Renée Zellweger, Judy captures the waning days of a beloved performer with clear-eyed compassion.Premiere Date:&nbsp;Sept. 25Related: The Best Shows on Amazon Prime Video$ NEWLY AVAILABLE TO RENT/BUY ON AMAZON VIDEO* AMAZON ORIGINALSAvailable 9/1Movies1/1 (2018) 1 Million Happy Nows (2018)A Birder's Guide To Everything (2014)  86%Abe &amp; Phil's Last Poker Game (2018)  73%Addicted To Fresno (2015)  30%Alex Cross (2012)  11%American Dragons (1998)Bachelor Lions (2020)Barney Thomson (The Legend of Barney Thomson) (2016)  62%Beach Party (1963)  43%Bewitched (2005)  24%Big Time (1988) Bitter Melon (2018)  86%Bully (2019) C.O.G.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%. A Skin So Soft (Ta peau si lisse) (2018) , a documentary look at the lives and gym habits of six bodybuilders, is at 100%. The Year of Spectacular Men (2018) , a coming of age drama directed by Lea Thompson and starring her daughters Zoey and Madelyn Deutch (the latter of whom wrote the screenplay), is at 80%. Gabriel and the Mountain (Gabriel e a montanha) (2018) , about a young man who sets out to travel the world before beginning college, is at 75%. Five Seasons: The Gardens Of Piet Oudolf (2018) , a documentary about the aesthetics and public works of the titular plantsman, is at 71%. The Yellow Birds (2018) , an Iraq War drama led by Alden Ehrenreich and Tye Sheridan, is at 44%.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

The library released today includes complete anthologies of original series like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under, selected seasons of ongoing shows such as Boardwalk Empire and True Blood, and some HBO original movies and miniseries, including Band of Brothers, John Adams, and Grey Gardens.Not sure where to start? The Rotten Tomatoes staff has some recommendations for you.Boardwalk Empire: Three SeasonsPicked by: Marya E. Gates, Social Media ManagerWhat it is: Boardwalk Empire follows the rise (and somewhat fall) of political boss-turned-bootlegger Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi) in Prohibition-era Atlantic City. Inspired by real people and events, historical gangsters and lawmen mix with fictional characters in a swirl of violence, flappers, spats, and booze as Nucky tries to build his empire.Why you should watch it: It would be worth it alone for the career-crowning performance from Steve Buscemi season after season, but the supporting cast — including Michael Pitt, Shea Whigham, Michael Stuhlbarg, Stephen Graham, Kelly Macdonald, Gretchen Mol, Jack Huston, Michael K. Williams, and Michael Shannon — and the characters they bring to life, create a perfect storm of greed, lust, ambition, and regret.The Wire: Five SeasonsPicked by: Ryan Fujitani, EditorWhat it is: The Wire begins by following a Baltimore detective who’s assigned to a misfit task force to investigate the criminal activities of a local drug lord. Over the course of five seasons, however, the series builds on that foundation, expanding to include intertwining stories about the port system, city hall, public education, and the news media.Why you should watch it: If you wish your typical police procedural had a bit more meat on its bones, this is the show for you. The stories here are crafted with care, with investigations that unfold over multiple seasons, and the depiction of Baltimore — even as a general stand-in for urban life in America — feels authentic. But the strength of the series lies in its characters, written in such fine detail that the lines between good and evil are often blurred. You’ll hate some of the cops, and you’ll love some of the killers, but you’ll always ride along to see what they do next.Angels in America: MiniseriesPicked by: Gabi Jacobs, Creative DirectorWhat it is: Angels in America is a 2003 miniseries adapted from a Tony Kushner play that deals with the devastating AIDS crisis during the mid-1980s. Set in New York City against the backdrop of Reagan-era politics, and played by a powerhouse cast including Meryl Streep and Al Pacino, the story follows six characters whose lives are affected by the deadly disease.Why you should watch it: Angels in America was a record-breaking, award-winning miniseries at the time. Over a decade later, HBO is revisiting this same theme from the same time period with another adaptation of a play called The Normal Heart, airing this weekend — to which Angels in America will be a perfection companion piece. For both, keep your Kleenex close by!Rome: Two SeasonsPicked by: Rebecca Lane, Editorial CoordinatorWhat it is: Set in the time of Caesar, this epic drama tells the story of Rome’s transition from republic to empire, as witnessed by two soldiers in the Roman army.Why you should watch it: With the gritty accuracy and striking visuals that you would expect from HBO, Rome excels in storytelling by taking its two lead characters and intertwining them into major historical events. The sweeping scope of the series is ambitious, but creators Bruno Heller, John Milius, and William J. MacDonald succeed in covering an entire empire.Enlightened: Two SeasonsPicked by: Kerr Lordygan, Review AggregatorWhat it is: In this dramedy by Laura Dern and Mike White, high-powered executive Amy Jellicoe (Dern) returns to the workforce after a public breakdown and subsequent treatment at a new-age rehab facility. Jellicoe’s position at Abaddonn Industries is reduced to a data-processing associate in an inessential department in the basement, where she researches high-level corruption and attempts to destroy the corporation.Why you should watch it: Enlightened somehow turns the unsympathetic character of Amy Jellicoe into someone to root for. The comedy is smart and the feel-good moments are sweet. Dern’s real-life mother, Diane Ladd, playing her onscreen mother is a treat; the presence of White, Luke Wilson and Dermot Mulroney add allure.True Blood: Three SeasonsPicked by: Catherine Pricci, Review AggregatorWhat it is: The town of Bon Temp, LA isn’t just some quiet, peaceful swampland — it’s also home to vampires and shape-shifters. A local waitress, Sookie Stackhouse, who can hear people’s thoughts, finds herself the unlikely center of attention, entangled in otherworldly drama.Why you should watch it: If blood doesn’t bother you, and you enjoy some soapy, campy, fantastic fun with a dash of sex here and there, this show is pure guilty pleasure at its finest. The attempt by humans to co-habitate with vampires by feeding them synthetic blood is an original take on the vampire genre. Plus, Paquin has chutzpah, and the two main vampires, played by Alexander Skarsgard and Stephen Moyer, aren’t too bad to look at either.Flight of the Conchords: Two SeasonsPicked by: Sarah Ricard, TV EditorWhat it is: Originally from New Zealand, musicians Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement try to make it as New York’s top guitar-based digi-bongo acapella-rap-funk-comedy folk duo. With only one fan to speak of, and their idiot manager Murray (Rhys Darby) running the show, Bret and Jemaine have a hard enough time locking down their next meal — never mind their next gig.Why you should watch it: The lo-fi comedy of the feckless, witless Conchords is at its best when they turn it up to 11 (OK, maybe 6), bursting into song. Bret and Jemaine’s songs are hilarious and weird, which — along with supporting players of top alterna-comedians Kristen Schaal, Eugene Mirman, and Arj Barker — make this one of the more unique half-hour comedies available.Deadwood: Three SeasonsPicked by: Tim Ryan, Senior EditorWhat it is: Deadwood isn’t the story of how the West was won; it’s the story of how the West was tamed. Set in a legendary 1870s South Dakota boomtown, it’s the tale of how a group of businessmen, outcasts, hucksters, and everyday folks turned a lawless outpost into a community, with a mix of hard work, cynicism, idealism, and violence.Why you should watch it: Sure, there are plenty of epic Westerns in the world, but Deadwood has both a sweep and an intimacy that’s alternately tense, exciting, poignant, and historically credible. There isn’t a weak link in the show’s huge ensemble cast (and though it’s a tough call, Ian McShane, as the Machiavellian saloon owner Al Swearengen, is probably the MVP). And if you’re interested in linguistics, Deadwood elevates swearing to a rarefied height.For more TV news, visit the Rotten Tomatoes TV Zone.","section":"Now Streaming","tags":"watch, canceled, Guide, new","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Staff-Picks-HBO-Programming-Now-Available-for-Amazon-Prime-Members"},{"id":"47508891773648","title":"Now Streaming: Jodorowsky’s Dune, The Manchurian Candidate, and More","content":"Now Streamingvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Now Streaming: Jodorowsky's Dune, The Manchurian Candidate, and Moreby RT Staff | July 8, 2014 |  CommentsThere aren’t a whole lot of brand new titles available to stream this week, save for an anime reboot on Hulu and an indie documentary on a celebrated cult director and the conceptually incredible film he never made.

Christy Lemire breaks down whether or not the film’s dark magic will spook the little ones and offers up a trio of alternatives — also about fantastic beasts in various forms — in case you can’t make it to theaters for&nbsp;The Crimes of Grindelwald… or choose not to risk freaking out your toddlers.THE&nbsp;MOVIEFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018)  36%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some sequences of fantasy action.The sequel to 2016’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is less fantastic, and it actually features fewer beasts. Nevertheless, this spin-off series from the Harry Potter&nbsp;universe continues to slog along. These films aren’t as strong as their source material, and this second one is a step down from the first. Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is back for more magical adventures in the 1920s, but they don’t have much to do with his work as a magizoologist. This time, a young Dumbledore (Jude Law) has tasked him with tracking down the villainous Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp), who has staged a daring prison break. Grindelwald is amassing all the pureblood wizards worldwide to rise up and take over the half-bloods and Muggles, or No-Majs as they’re known here. Themes of totalitarianism lingered over the first film, but this time, Potter mastermind and screenwriter J.K. Rowling spells it out in much more plain and harrowing fashion. We see imagery reminiscent of the Holocaust in a theoretical flash-forward: trains, fires, ashes. The wizard battles can be quite intense and the overall tone is dark. And returning director David Yates (who also directed the last four Harry Potter movies) is juggling so many characters and subplots, it might be difficult for younger viewers to follow. I’d say this is fine for kids around 9 and older, especially if they’re already familiar with the series.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf the Fantastic Beasts movies are too intense for the kids in your family – or you’re just looking for something better – here are some other films featuring magical creatures you all might enjoy.Pete's Dragon (2016)  88%Rating:&nbsp;GYou could show your kids the 1977 original, as well. But this one’s far more visually dazzling (and probably easier to find). Director David Lowery’s wistful and transporting family film is sort of a remake, in that it’s about a boy named Pete, and he has a dragon, but that’s about it.&nbsp;This is a lovely film for the whole family; it takes place in the 1970s and feels as if it was made then, too. But in classic Disney tradition, it’s about an orphan.&nbsp;Pete (Oakes Fegley) lost his parents at a very young age, and has been raised in the forest by his only friend: a furry, green dragon he named Elliot. When a forest ranger (Bryce Dallas Howard) discovers him at age 11 and brings him home, he struggles to adjust to civilization while trying to protect his magical pal from loggers who want to capture him for their own glory. Lowery’s pacing is unhurried and he uses wordless sequences efficiently to tell his story. The relationship between Pete and Elliot is full of both frolic and joy as well as quiet, intimate moments. But in the film’s first few minutes, we do see the car accident that killed Pete’s parents; he survives, then wanders alone in the woods until he meets Elliot. The sense of loneliness and loss is powerful and might be too much for very young viewers. Also, a group of loggers take down the dragon using tranquilizer guns and chain him to a flatbed truck, which also could be disturbing. But mostly, I’d say this is a great choice for viewers around 6 and older.Watch now on: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW, iTunesGremlins (1984)  85%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for adult situations/language, and violence.Sure, it’s one of the films that inspired the MPAA to create the PG-13 rating, so it’s probably best suited for slightly older kids. But Gremlins&nbsp;is a fundamental ‘80s movie and it’s a ton of fun. Director Joe Dante’s horror comedy classic follows the mayhem that transpires when a seemingly adorable, cuddly creature is mishandled. You’re not supposed to expose it to bright light, get it wet, or feed it after midnight. But of course, things go horribly, thrillingly wrong, turning the sweet-faced Gizmo into a maniacal fiend who spawns multiple offspring hell-bent on wreaking havoc. (The effects are achieved through puppets, but man, are they creepy puppets.) Understandably, the human response to this calamity is equally intense. Gremlins turns violent and contains quite a bit of language. Still, this is a blast of a choice for viewers around 10 and older.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunesHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)  81%Rating: PG, for some scary moments and mild language.If your kids are new to the whole Harry Potter universe and you’re looking to introduce them to it, at least in film form, why not start from the beginning? The first couple of movies in the series – and especially the first one – are quite sweet and gentle. There’s plenty of magic to be found, and the villains and dark themes begin announcing their presence. But for the most part, director Chris Columbus’ film is all about ushering us into Rowling’s rich world. Plus, it’s just such a hoot to see these now-established actors when they were still young unknowns. You know the story – I won’t waste your time with it here. The orphaned Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), living miserably with his oppressive aunt and uncle, discovers he’s a wizard and is whisked away to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry gets his own pet owl, whom he names Hedwig, and begins his close friendship with the towering Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), who manages many of the fantastic beasts as Hogwarts’ groundskeeper. Among the creatures Harry and his friends encounter are a baby dragon named Norbert and a three-headed dog ironically named Fluffy. The Harry Potter&nbsp;movies improve significantly from here, but Sorcerer’s Stone&nbsp;is certainly a great place to start for viewers around 7 and older.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunes","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"green, York, archives, sequels, 2016","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/16111019/Fantastic-Beasts-Grindelwald-PG.jpg","slug":"the-crimes-of-grindelwald-and-three-other-films-about-fantastic-beasts"},{"id":"47509018182487","title":"Video: Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L.

And while Eddie Brock and his alien symbiote frenemy are indeed ripped from the comics, this is another would-be superhero who’s not exactly kid-friendly, even if the film isn’t rated R like many hoped it would be. With that in mind, Christy Lemire&nbsp;offers up a closer look at the film and its potential to frighten the youngest viewers.THE&nbsp;MOVIEVenom (2018)  29%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for language.Venom fans might have hoped – or at least expected – that a big-screen telling of the Marvel villain’s origins would come with an R rating. After all, he is a fearsome alien life force: a gooey symbiote who bonds with a hospitable host and uses it to wreak havoc. With his strength, speed and shape-shifting abilities, he causes particular trouble as a nemesis of Spider-Man. And he’s just plain terrifying to look at: a dark, hulking behemoth with menacing, white eyes and razor-sharp teeth.But Venom, in theaters this weekend, ended up being PG-13. Granted, with its massive violence, it’s right there on the edge of what you can get away with and still earn that rating. But director Ruben Fleischer said it was always his intention to make his comic-book blockbuster accessible to the largest audience possible. In a recent interview with the website Polygon, Fleischer said: “We didn’t want to make a movie that excluded any fans… Venom fans actually are of all ages, and so we wanted to be inclusive to all the fans that were excited about the movie.” He added that we shouldn’t expect an R-rated director’s cut anytime in the future either. This is it: “I said throughout that I wanted to push the violence to the hilt.” That stands in contrast to the depiction of another Marvel antihero, the Deadpool&nbsp;movies, which wallow in their R rating in terms of violence, language, and raunchy humor.Still, Venom&nbsp;isn’t exactly a movie for viewers of all ages, as Fleischer puts it. It’s graphic and intense, featuring a dizzying amount of carnage – but no bloodshed. Hence, the PG-13. One character is beheaded, while others get their heads eaten off entirely. The film features several punishing fight sequences as investigative reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) finds that his limbs can stretch and transform into various sharp, shiny weapons once Venom takes over his body. His back throws off piercing spikes as if he were a giant, muscular porcupine. But Venom&nbsp;also features the usual kind of large-scale destruction you see in comic book extravaganzas: chase scenes resulting in car crashes, the fiery evisceration of a rocket ship, and countless rounds of gunfire from authorities struggling in vain to take down this powerful creature. There’s also quite a bit of language scattered throughout, including the one F-bomb allowed in a PG-13 movie. And we see a bit of kissing between Hardy and Michelle Williams as his ex-fiancée, as well as the suggestion that they’ve had sex.I took my son to a critics screening of Venom&nbsp;and he wasn’t afraid of anything, but he’s also seen a lot more movies (including a lot more movies of this type) than the average 9-year-old. I’d say Venom&nbsp;is really more appropriate for viewers around 12 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"The, biography, LGBTQ, Originals, San","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/05135016/Venom-PG.jpg","slug":"venom-isnt-rated-r-but-its-got-decapitations-and-destruction"},{"id":"47508899012379","title":"Why Parents Should Ignore Eighth Grade‘s R Rating","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Why Parents Should Ignore Eighth Grade's R RatingThis earnest depiction of teen life will ring true for eighth graders -- and anyone who remembers what it was like to be 13 years old.by Christy Lemire | August 3, 2018 |  CommentsStand-up comedian Bo Burnham’s feature directorial debut has picked up rave reviews since it premiered at Sundance, but the MPAA has slapped an R rating on it, making it more difficult for younger viewers to see it. But, as Christy Lemire argues, this is exactly the kind of movie those teens and tweens should see, as she breaks down what earned the movie its rating and what you can expect going into it.THE&nbsp;MOVIEEighth Grade (2018)  99%Rating: R, for language and some sexual material.Eighth Grade is one of the best movies of the year, so I’m thrilled that it’s opening nationwide this weekend to give more people the opportunity to see it. Writer-director Bo Burnham’s story about an introverted 13-year-old girl (the hilarious and heartbreaking Elsie Fisher) navigating the last week of middle school is emotionally raw and relatable in so many ways. Middle school is painfully awkward no matter who you are or where you are, and Eighth Grade&nbsp;captures this fraught moment in time beautifully. It also happens to be rated R, meaning that – in theory – a lot of the young viewers who would benefit from seeing it might not be able to get a ticket.I urge you to consider allowing the older kids in your home to see this film. Here’s where the R rating comes from: There’s quite a bit of language scattered throughout. The characters talk the way kids this age truly talk, and that means some profanity. There’s also some discussion of naked cell phone pictures and whether or not a character is willing to perform a sex act on another, but it comes from a place of false bravado. And in one particularly tense scene, our heroine finds herself in the backseat of a car with a teenage guy who’s a few years older than she is – but how that moment shakes out might surprise you.Eighth Grade&nbsp;also could help tweens and teens in the way it depicts the psychological impact of social media and the Internet in general. Fisher’s character, Kayla, finds herself obsessing over the popular kids’ Instagram feeds. She also projects an image of the kind of confident person she’d like to be through her own series of YouTube self-help videos — which only get a handful of views. Social media expedites and heightens the anxieties of this harrowing time full of insecurity, and Eighth Grade depicts that uncomfortable sensation vividly.Like The Breakfast Club&nbsp;and Fast Times at Ridgemont High&nbsp;before it, Eighth Grade&nbsp;carries a rating that may make it seem too mature for your kids, but it’s probably exactly what they need to see right now as they figure out their place in the world. I highly recommend it for viewers who are in eighth grade themselves – and maybe even sixth or seventh — &nbsp;and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Pictures, Showtime, E3, Food, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/03121827/Eighth-Grade-PG.jpg","slug":"why-parents-should-ignore-eighth-grades-r-rating"},{"id":"47508900542246","title":"Pacific Rim: Uprising Might Be Too Intense for Kids, so Here Are Three Robot-Themed Alternatives","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Pacific Rim: Uprising Might Be Too Intense for Kids, so Here Are Three Robot-Themed Alternativesby Christy Lemire | March 23, 2018 |  CommentsThis week’s&nbsp;Pacific Rim: Uprising features giant robots fighting giant monsters, which means little boys and girls are likely to be interested in seeing the spectacle. Unfortunately, it hasn’t been particularly well-received, and with a PG-13 rating, it might be a little too intense for the youngest viewers. Christy Lemire looks at the family-friendliness of&nbsp;Pacific Rim and offers three robot-themed alternatives you can watch with your kids if you choose to stay home.THE&nbsp;MOVIEPacific Rim Uprising (2018)  42%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and some language.It’s giant robots fighting giant monsters… again! What more do you need to know? The sequel to the 2013’s Pacific Rim&nbsp;is definitely missing director Guillermo del Toro’s visual flair and overall tonal weirdness. Stephen DeKnight’s film is a lot more straightforward – and a lot more like a Transformers&nbsp;movie, with plenty of scenes of robots fighting other robots. Once the kaiju show up to do battle for the planet, Uprising&nbsp;becomes the ridiculous, over-the-top spectacle you were hoping to see. John Boyega stars as Jake Pentecost, son of Idris Elba’s Stacker Pentecost, who must lead a team of young Jaeger pilots when a new global threat emerges. Mass urban destruction ensues – but many major cities already were remnants of their former selves following the last robot-vs.-kaiju showdown. This is a silly movie but also a rather violent one. The people inside the Jaegers get knocked around and bloodied quite a bit. There’s some gnarly alien imagery that might gross out younger viewers. And the monsters themselves are enormous and ferocious – definitely too much for little kids to handle. Uprising also features sporadic curse words within the stilted dialogue. My 8-year-old son wasn’t freaked out by anything here, but he also thought it was terrible. Fine for viewers around 10 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSPacific Rim:&nbsp;Uprising&nbsp;may be too intense for the various young viewers in your family. If so, here are a few other giant robot movies you might enjoy sharing with them:The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)  95%Rating:&nbsp;GMore than a half-century later, this remains one of the most compelling and influential alien invasion movies ever. And the themes of fear and understanding it explores – as well as its underlying plea for peace – certainly remain relevant, even though the story takes place during the Cold War. The film from the formidable director Robert Wise (West Side Story, The Sound of Music) was remade in 2008 starring Keanu Reeves, but you should really go for the original if you’re going to seek this out. An appealing and soft-spoken space traveler (Michael Rennie) lands his flying saucer on Earth – Washington D.C., to be exact – warning that humans must find away to achieve peace or be destroyed. His protector is the giant, silver robot Gort, who goes on the attack when an overzealous soldier fires his gun. General mistrust and panic eventually erupt – proving the alien’s point precisely. You kids will probably think the special effects look low-tech and cheesy, but the storytelling and the message remain solid. A worthwhile throwback choice for viewers around 6 or 7 and older.Watch now on: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW, iTunesThe Iron Giant (1999)  96%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for fantasy action and mild language.Before he was Groot, Vin Diesel lent his serious pipes to the title character of the animated The Iron Giant, a misunderstood robot who frightens a small town. When he drops from the sky and lands in rural Maine in the late 1950s, folks don’t know what to make of him. But a 9-year-old boy named Hogarth (Eli Marienthal) becomes the robot’s friend in this touching tale based on the 1968 Ted Hughes novel The Iron Man. The film from veteran Pixar director Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille) is an allegory about understanding those who seem different or scary, as so much of the best science fiction is. There’s plenty of action, including gunfire, and our young hero finds himself in danger as he tries to protect his new friend from the forces that are trying to destroy him. There’s also a little bit of smoking, a little bit of language and a little bit of potty humor. But overall, The Iron Giant&nbsp;is a sweet and playful film with a heartwarming message. Excellent for the whole family.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunesBig Hero 6 (2014)  90%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for action and peril, some rude humor and thematic elements.Hello, he is Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.

This action comedy from Walt Disney Animation deservedly won an Oscar for best animated feature, with its vibrant design and heartwarming story. Ryan Potter provides the voice of Hiro, a brilliant 13-year-old who’s obsessed with everything high-tech. When his beloved older brother Tadashi dies early in the film, Hiro must take over the pet project they’d been working on together: an enormous, inflatable robot named Baymax,&nbsp;(voiced by Scott Adsit) who provides personalized medical care and plenty of hugs. Along with Tadashi’s college friends — a merry, multi-ethnic band of nerds — they form a team to battle a bad guy who steals Hiro’s latest invention with nefarious intent. The film is high-energy and colorful but eventually reveals a darker undercurrent that may be disturbing for some kids. At the film’s start, the two brothers already are living with their aunt (Maya Rudolph) because their parents died. And the villain is a cloaked figure in a frightening mask with infinite power at his fingertips. Mostly, though, it’s lively and joyous and filled with physical comedy. A great choice for kids around 5 and older.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunes","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"thriller, Sematary, See, heist, Country, finale, movies, in, festival, Pride, Musicals, MSNBC, Pacific","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23110917/Pacific-Rim-Uprising-PG.jpg","slug":"pacific-rim-uprising-might-be-too-intense-for-kids-so-here-are-three-robot-themed-alternatives"},{"id":"47508898998037","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Aquaman and Bumblebee?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Aquaman and Bumblebee?Film critic Christy Lemire breaks down what to expect if you're taking the whole fam to see the latest DCEU movie or the Transformers prequel.by Christy Lemire | December 21, 2018 |  CommentsWith a total of seven new films either opening in wide release or expanding from limited this weekend, it’s no surprise that at least three of them will be competing to draw in younger viewers. Of those three, two are rated PG-13, namely the latest entry in the DC Extended Universe and a prequel to the&nbsp;Transformers franchise. Both have gotten solid reviews, but exactly how much do each of them lean into that PG-13 rating? Christy Lemire offers the parental perspective on both, in case you’re in the mood to treat the family to a pre-Christmas big screen adventure.NOW IN THEATERSAquaman (2018)  65%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for some language.Over-the-top, underwater adventures abound in this insane DC Comics prequel from Furious 7&nbsp;director James Wan. Jason Momoa stars as the titular superhero, a half-human, half-Atlantean living on the land who reluctantly accepts that he must take his place as heir to the throne of Atlantis in the sea. A multitude of obstacles lie in his path, including entire armies of men, sea creatures, and men riding on sea creatures. It’s knowingly silly and outlandish, but it can also be extremely violent. The hulking Momoa’s Arthur Curry takes on countless foes with his bare hands, flattening and flinging people across the room with ease. One scene finds Arthur and the Atlantean princess Mera (Amber Heard) fighting off a terrifying swarm of ravenous, sharp-toothed monsters. We also see several perilous chases, stabbings and a ton of gunfire from a variety of weapons. The script includes quite a bit of language, as well as some romantic tension and kissing between Arthur and Mera. It’s all the usual comic book movie stuff, but even more so – and that includes a running time that pushes 2 ½ hours. I’d say this is suitable for viewers around 10 and older, especially if they’ve seen other blockbusters like this before.Bumblebee (2018)  90%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action violence.This is a shockingly good Transformers&nbsp;movie. It’s also the only good Transformers&nbsp;movie, but its joys aren’t merely relative. Director Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings) has managed to find actual humanity within one of these behemoth action spectacles about robots in disguise, so much so that Bumblebee&nbsp;might even bring a tear or two to your eye. Set in 1987, the movie serves as an origin story for the good-natured, yellow Autobot who communicates through songs on the radio. The tomboyish, teenage Charlie (a charismatic Hailee Steinfeld) finds him as a beat-up Volkswagen Bug, brings him home and fixes him up. Once he reveals his true self, the two become fast friends (no pun intended). But Charlie and her smitten neighbor, Memo (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.), soon get sucked into the intergalactic battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons. There’s quite a bit of rock ’em, sock ’em robot action here — giant, noisy, punishing brawls resulting in mass injury and destruction — but not as much as you’d ordinarily see in a Transformers&nbsp;movie. In a lot of ways, Bumblebee&nbsp;actually has more in common with E.T. – The Extra-Terrestrial, especially as Charlie copes with the absence of her father by befriending a sweet alien being. I brought my 9-year-old son with me to a screening and we both loved it. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 8 or 9 and older; this is one of the rare occasions in which a PG-13 rating seems too harsh.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Poppins, blaxploitation, A&E, Ovation, ViacomCBS, cops, history","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21121231/AquaBumble1.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-aquaman-and-bumblebee"},{"id":"47508900534051","title":"If Avengers: Infinity War Is Too Intense for Your Kids, Here Are Three Alternatives","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})If Avengers: Infinity War Is Too Intense for Your Kids, Here Are Three Alternativesby Christy Lemire | April 27, 2018 |  CommentsAvengers: Infinity War is one of most anticipated movies — if not the most anticipated movie — of the year, so even if you haven’t been particularly invested in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, chances are your kids have bugged you about seeing it this weekend. That said, it is an explosive, intense, exhausting, emotional affair, and it may not be suitable for all children. Read on for Christy Lemire’s helpful take&nbsp;on&nbsp;Infinity War‘s family-friendliness and a trio of alternative adventures with big ensemble casts that you can watch at home instead.THE&nbsp;MOVIEAvengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout, language and some crude references.This is the biggie you’ve been waiting for: the crossover extravaganza uniting all your favorite superheroes. Infinity War connects the various stories from the previous stand-alone offerings in the Marvel Cinematic Universe – the Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;movies, the Captain America&nbsp;and Thor&nbsp;flicks, etc. – for one elaborate, dizzying battle against a seemingly insurmountable villain. Iron Man and Spider-Man, Black Widow and Black Panther, Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange and many more – they all must team up to fight the massive Thanos, who’s collecting all six Infinity Stones to use their power to wipe out half the population. It’s heavy stuff, but directors Anthony and Joe Russo also aim to keep things light with the witty banter Marvel movies so often feature. But as the title suggests, Infinity War is indeed a war, with enormous, destructive battle sequences and a ton of weaponry and punishing fistfights. The stakes truly are life and death for millions of people and – spoiler alert – for some of our heroes, as well. Besides being an emotionally dense movie, Infinity War&nbsp;is extremely long at two and a half hours, and of course you’ll want to stay until the very end for the teaser of the next movie. And there’s quite a bit of language scattered throughout. This is the most intense Marvel film yet, both thematically and visually, and it’s probably appropriate for viewers around 10 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSAvengers: Infinity War isn’t the first movie to feature a massive cast of major stars. If the latest from Marvel is too much for your kids, here are a few suggestions you can share with the whole family:It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963)  70%Rating:&nbsp;GIf you thought Infinity War&nbsp;sounded long, add another hour and you’ll have this all-star, Oscar-winning comedy classic. Spencer Tracy, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett, Ethel Merman, Mickey Rooney, Phil Silvers, Jonathan Winters, Jerry Lewis, Carl Reiner and Jim Backus are among the enormous cast of characters here. A bunch of frustrated folks get stuck in a traffic accident caused by a careless driver (Jimmy Durante). He tells everyone he’s hidden a huge, stolen fortune under a giant W — then he dies suddenly, sending the confused onlookers on a crazy chase. There’s a ton of slapstick humor here, with various characters getting injured along the way. Smoking and drinking are common, given the era. But the wide variety of methods the characters use to find the money is amusing for all ages. Think of it as a precursor to The Amazing Race. Fine for viewers around 6 or 7 and older; and because it’s so long, maybe you can watch it with them in pieces.Watch now on: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW, iTunesThe Towering Inferno (1974)  69%Rating:&nbsp;PGA classic ‘70s disaster spectacular and the winner of three Academy Awards, including best cinematography. It also earned a nomination for best picture — so it’s high-quality schlock. Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Richard Chamberlain, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner, Susan Blakely, Jennifer Jones, and O.J. Simpson (back when he was still beloved and popular) are among the film’s stars. The extravaganza from producer Irwin Allen takes place at the opening of an enormous – but badly built – San Francisco skyscraper. When a massive fire breaks out, the entire building and everyone inside are in danger. Destruction abounds and many people perish. There’s also a helicopter crash and several explosions. It’s intense and long at two hours and 45 minutes, but The Towering Inferno&nbsp;is also about perseverance, bravery and teamwork. Fine for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunesOcean's Eleven (2001)  83%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some language and sexual content.These are my Avengers: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle and more in a remake of a 1960 film that was just as star-studded (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Angie Dickinson, Peter Lawford, Joey Bishop). In both movies, a rag-tag band of charismatic thieves dares to pull off a massive Las Vegas casino heist in one night. Steven Soderbergh’s version is glitzy and fizzy – the most irresistible bit of escapist fun. Everyone’s gorgeous, the banter is witty, and the pacing is snappy. The movie does ask you to root for con artists and criminals, but the tycoon they’re stealing from isn’t exactly a good guy himself. Some punches get thrown and there are a few explosions. There’s a bit of language scattered throughout. And there’s one scene involving strippers at a nightclub, but we don’t see very much. All in all, a blast for the older kids in your family – and a good primer for the all-female Ocean’s 8, coming out in June. Good for tweens and up.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunes","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"curtis, Amazon, Video, Globe, Adventures, ABC, E!","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/27130354/Avengers-Infinity-War-PG.jpg","slug":"if-avengers-infinity-war-is-too-intense-for-your-kids-here-are-three-alternatives"},{"id":"47508902231860","title":"Here’s What to Expect if You Take Your Kids to Star Wars: The Last Jedi","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Here's What to Expect if You Take Your Kids to Star Wars: The Last Jediby Christy Lemire | December 15, 2017 |  CommentsWhile we would normally do a list of family-friendly recommendations based on the films opening this week, one of them happens to be&nbsp;a&nbsp;Star Wars movie. In other words, we know there’s a pretty strong chance that not only will your kids be interested in it, but you’ll probably want to see it with them, too. With that in mind, Christy breaks down what to expect if you’re taking the whole fam to see Luke, Leia, Rey, Kylo and the gang this weekend, and offers her take on another movie aimed squarely at younger audiences in case you can’t get tickets to&nbsp;The Last Jedi.NOW IN THEATERSStar Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)  90%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.Episode VIII is one of the absolute best yet in the Star Wars&nbsp;saga: thrilling and moving with a surprisingly cheeky streak and a deep emotional resonance. It’s also the most jaw-droppingly gorgeous Star Wars film ever made. Writer-director Rian Johnson (Brick, Looper) managed to navigate the Lucasfilm machinery and come out the other side with a film that’s true to the revered series, yet bears his voice. If your kids have seen the previous films, they’ll enjoy the humor and the energy here as well as the many exciting action sequences. I brought my 8-year-old son, Nicolas – who’s been a huge Star Wars&nbsp;fan for years — to a screening with me. He said this was the best one yet – and he asked whether he could have a porg for Christmas. (The big-eyed puffins that populate the island where Luke Skywalker lives are indeed adorable.) But if you have very young kids, or if they they’re not familiar with these characters and this world, The Last Jedi may be too much for them. Aside from being two and a half hours long, the film has several intense battles. There’s a giant light-saber duel that’s one for the ages. Many characters perish in elaborate dogfights between the plucky Rebellion and the evil First Order. Their diabolical leader, Snoke (Andy Serkis), might be too creepy for kids. And several characters find themselves on the verge of execution, including the heroic Finn (John Boyega) and his new partner, a Resistance mechanic named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). But it’s a complete blast and very much worth seeing in the theater to enjoy the visuals and the rousing sense of community. Great for viewers around 7 or 8 and older.Ferdinand (2017)  72%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for rude humor, action and some thematic elements.If the new Star Wars movie is too much for your kids to handle (or if all the showings near you are sold out), there’s always Ferdinand, which truly is appropriate for the whole family. It’s based on the classic book about a giant bull who’d rather smell the flowers than step into the bullfighting ring. Here, he’s voiced by John Cena, a former wrestler himself who’s already proven his acting chops in movies like Trainwreck&nbsp;and Sisters. Despite the inherently violent nature of bullfighting, Ferdinand&nbsp;is a rather gentle movie. It alludes to the ugly fate that befalls these animals without actually showing it. But Ferdinand&nbsp;also suggests that the bulls who aren’t tough enough to make it in the ring get sent to the slaughterhouse, which might be a disturbing notion for your children. The movie doesn’t dwell on that fact, though, opting instead to focus on its ensemble of colorful creatures. The great Kate McKinnon provides the voice of a goat who becomes Ferdinand’s goofy sidekick. There’s also a trio of thieving hedgehogs and another trio of preening show ponies. (Ferdinand&nbsp;is awfully crowded with wacky supporting characters.) The gentle bull has been the target of bullying his whole life, but he endures it with grace and comes out stronger and happier in the end. It’s a nice story that’s suitable for all ages.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"rotten, TV, star, Tubi, Prime, frames, deadpool, OneApp, Universal, The, Marathons, Lionsgate","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/15171225/Star-Wars-Last-Jedi-PG.jpg","slug":"heres-what-to-expect-if-you-take-your-kids-to-star-wars-the-last-jedi"},{"id":"47508900561711","title":"Three Country Music Movies That Are Better Than Forever My Girl","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Three Country Music Movies That Are Better Than Forever My Girlby Christy Lemire | January 19, 2018 |  CommentsForever My Girl, which opens this week, is a tame, PG-rated romantic drama about a country music star’s homecoming that’s aimed at primarily teenage audiences. Unfortunately, critics say it isn’t particularly good, even for its genre, so if you’re not particularly interested in the film, Christy Lemire offers up three alternatives that are probably quite a bit more satisfying, but also just mild enough to watch with your kids… depending on their age and maturity level.THE MOVIEForever My Girl (2018)  24%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements including drinking, and for language.This bland, Nicholas Sparks-adjacent romance finds country music superstar Liam Page (Alex Roe) returning to his Louisiana small town and reconnecting with Josie (Jessica Rothe), the fiancée he left at the altar eight years earlier to pursue fame and fortune. It’s all about forgiveness, reconciliation and insipid music, with an adorable little girl (Abby Ryder Fortson) at the center. Writer-director Bethany Ashton Wolf’s film has some picturesque images of the bayou, and Roe and Rothe are sufficiently pretty, as well. But they don’t have much chemistry with each other, and many of the movie’s supposedly dramatic moments end up being unintentionally hilarious. Also, this is a decidedly PG-rated depiction of country-star excess, so Liam is only slightly surly and his major drinking problem consists of bringing a flask to a funeral. (He also visits the cleanest and most wholesome honky-tonk ever depicted on screen.) A child is briefly in peril. And before Liam sees the light, he wakes up in a hotel room with a groupie, but we don’t see any actual physical contact. This is a wholesome story of faith and redemption, suitable for viewers around 7 or 8 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf Forever My Girl has you thinking about other movies set in the country music world you can watch with your family, here are a few suggestions:Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009)  43%Rating:&nbsp;G.I’m not saying it’s a great movie, but it’s a fine choice if you’re looking for something the whole family can watch, and Miley Cyrus does have her undeniable charms here. The singer/songwriter/provocateur was still clinging to the last vestiges of her innocent, Disney Channel image here, playing both&nbsp;small-town sweetheart Miley Stewart and her secret pop-star alter ego, Hannah Montana. Similar to Forever My Girl, Miley gets a little petulant and carried away with her celebrity lifestyle in Los Angeles. This prompts a return to Tennessee for some hometown reprogramming, courtesy of Cyrus’ real-life dad, country star Billy Ray Cyrus. Slapstick humor abounds down on the farm, and Miley finds her first boyfriend in a farmhand (Lucas Till) who was a childhood friend. And of course, because this is a Hannah Montana&nbsp;adventure, the movie is filled with music. The insanely catchy Hoedown Throwdown&nbsp;is admittedly a highlight, as is the power ballad The Climb. Fine for all ages.Coal Miner's Daughter (1980)  86%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for adult situations/language and violence.The gold standard for how to make a music biopic; everything else comes up short by comparison. Sissy Spacek rightly earned the Academy Award for best actress for her vivid portrayal of country music legend Loretta Lynn, and Michael Apted’s film received another six nominations, including best picture. I cannot even begin to tell you how many times I watched Coal Miner’s Daughter&nbsp;when I was 8 years old, even though I realize in retrospect that I didn’t truly understand some of the more adult elements of the story. Spacek stars as Lynn from the time she was a 13-year-old girl growing up poor in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, all the way through her rise to country music superstardom. We see her marry her husband Doolittle Lynn (Tommy Lee Jones) when she was 15 and he was 22 (including their awkward wedding night in motel room), play the Grand Ole Opry, become friends with her idol, Patsy Cline (Beverly D, Angelo) and give birth to multiple children. But the pressure of performing and touring while also juggling fame and family causes her to have a breakdown. We also witness Lynn’s devastation after Cline’s death in a plane crash. And Doolittle Lynn is a notorious drunk and womanizer – which was the inspiration for many of Lynn’s most enduring country hits. Spacek shows massive range her in portraying Lynn over several decades and she did all her own singing. This is a beautifully acted film with a rich sense of place. It hits the important moments of Lynn’s life but still feels like a full, complex story. I highly recommend it for viewers around 8 and older, especially if they have an interest in music or performing.Walk the Line (2005)  82%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some language, thematic material and depiction of drug dependency.Another great music biopic and another Academy Award-winning film: this time for best actress Reese Witherspoon’s performance as June Carter Cash, the muse and longtime love of Johnny Cash. Joaquin Phoenix also earned an Oscar nomination for his indelible role as the iconic, influential Cash. Director and co-writer James Mangold’s film may follow a familiar path along the way to country star greatness, from Cash’s youth on an Arkansas cotton farm and his early dabblings in music through his romance with singer June Carter and early dabblings in drugs. And of course, there are the eventual redemption and perspective that come with time and age. But Walk the Line&nbsp;features vibrant performances and tremendous energy. Phoenix and Witherspoon have ridiculous chemistry and, as Spacek did in Coal Miner’s Daughter, they performed their own songs and played their own instruments. But there’s even more grown-up material here, including adultery, significant drug and alcohol abuse, depression and language. Still, it’s a classic, and a fine choice for viewers around 13 and up. (And when your kids are older, you can show them the excellent and extremely R-rated Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox&nbsp;story, a dead-on parody starring John C. Reilly.)","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Musicals, serial, Plus, globe","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/19121455/Forever_My_Girl_PG.jpg","slug":"three-country-music-movies-that-are-better-than-forever-my-girl"},{"id":"47508902223665","title":"Three Family-Friendly Haunted House Movies That Are Better than Insidious: The Last Key","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Three Family-Friendly Haunted House Movies That Are Better than Insidious: The Last Keyby Christy Lemire | January 5, 2018 |  Comments2018 is finally here, and the first big release of the year is the latest (and presumably final) chapter in the&nbsp;Insidious franchise. It’s a PG-13 horror flick, but if you don’t think your kids could handle it — or if you don’t think&nbsp;they’ll particularly care for it — then we’ve got a few alternatives in mind. Read on for Christy’s take on&nbsp;Insidious: The Last Key and three recommendations you can watch at home instead.THE MOVIEInsidious: The Last Key (2018)  33%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for disturbing thematic content, violence and terror and brief strong language.The fourth and presumably last movie in the Insidious&nbsp;franchise (if the title is providing any clues) is better than you might expect from a January horror movie. But it’s also quite scary, with several startling jump scares and disturbing imagery throughout. If you already had reservations about going down into the basement, the latest Insidious&nbsp;movie will do nothing to reassure you. The great character actress Lin Shaye returns to the central role of parapsychologist Elise, who helps families purge their houses of the demons that are haunting them. But this time, she gets a call from a man living in her childhood home in small-town New Mexico, which forces her to relive the horrors she endured there from her cruel father. The physical and psychological abuse thrust upon Elise as a girl decades earlier is actually harder to watch than any spiritual frights – but those will freak you out, too. Insidious: The Last Key&nbsp;can be a joltingly noisy movie, but director Adam Robitel also puts you on edge through the use of silence in this dark, creepy house. Fine for viewers around 13 and older… if they dare.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf the latest Insidious&nbsp;is too intense for your kids (and it probably will be), here are some other haunted house movies for various ages that you and your family will enjoy:Monster House (2006)  75%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for scary images and sequences, thematic elements, some crude humor and brief language.An animated delight from producers Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis, Monster House&nbsp;is about a house that is literally a monster. Three teenagers (voiced by Mitchell Musso, Sam Lerner, and Spencer Locke) discover that the house across the street isn’t merely creepy and dilapidated, as it looks from the outside. It’s a living, breathing entity that chews up people and things and sometimes spits them back out again. Windows serve as eyes and a long, red carpet lashes out like a tongue. It’s possessed by a soul seeking revenge from beyond the grave, and it thrives on the energy of humans. That may sound pretty scary, and it may be too intense for very little kids. Along those lines, the stop-motion animated characters may look a tad off-kilter, given how much technology has improved over the past decade. But most younger viewers will find Monster House to be a clever and amusing adventure. The teen characters here are in constant danger but they’re resourceful and (eventually) brave, and they work together as a team. Fine for viewers around 7 and older – and perhaps a great, first scary movie to show your kids.Beetlejuice (1988)  85%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for adult situations/language and violence.One of Tim Burton’s earliest and best films – it’s only his second feature after Pee-wee’s Big Adventure&nbsp;– this oozes his signature mix of playful and macabre, colorful and dark. Michael Keaton gives one of the greatest comic performances of his long and varied career as the title character: a raunchy and profane spirit-for-hire who helps a recently deceased couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) scare the new owners out of their home. Perfect for the conspicuous consumption of the era, the new husband and wife are obnoxious yuppies (Catherine O’Hara and Jeffrey Jones) who throw lavish parties for their horrible friends. Only the couple’s sullen teenage daughter (Winona Ryder in one of her key roles) can see and sympathize with the dead couple. Beetlejuice is lively and ton of fun, with the wildly detailed costumes and production design we’ve come to expect over the years from Burton’s films. Some of the humor is rather adult – especially from the hard-partying Beetlejuice himself, who visits a brothel at one point. There’s some scattered, strong language. And fundamentally, the film is about a couple coming to grips with the fact that they’re no longer alive, which may be disturbing for younger viewers. But the racier material will probably go over a lot of kids’ heads. Fine for around ages 10 and up.Poltergeist (1982)  86%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for adult situations/language and violence.One of the greatest horror movies, period, but also one of the greatest haunted-house movies. Poltergeist&nbsp;kept me awake many a night when I was a little girl; in retrospect, I was probably too young to see it, but hey – I had permissive parents. (You guys will show better judgment, I’m sure.) But Tobe Hooper’s film, which Spielberg produced and co-wrote, is a must-see (or re-see) as a thrilling exploration of the dark side of suburbia. It features so many iconic lines and images; you’ve probably never looked at a snowy television screen the same way since. And Lin Shaye’s character in the Insidious movies definitely calls to mind the late, great Zelda Rubenstein as the brilliant and eccentric medium who famously “cleaned” the haunted house of Poltergeist. Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams, and Beatrice Straight lead the excellent cast. A family enjoying the supposed security of Southern California tract-housing bliss finds everything upended when their youngest child, Carol Ann (the late, deeply creepy Heather O’Rourke), hears voices, then gets sucked into another dimension by a host of restless spirits. Poltergeist vividly explores childhood fears; from the toys to the closets to even the wind in the trees, nothing is safe. And the climax that reveals why the angry souls are stirring things up is truly nightmarish. A great choice for tweens and older who can handle inspired, real-world scares.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"action, stop","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/05123313/Insidious-Last-Key-PG.jpg","slug":"three-family-friendly-haunted-house-movies-that-are-better-than-insidious-the-last-key"},{"id":"47508902243128","title":"Justice League Might Be Too Intense for Your Kids","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Justice League Might Be Too Intense for Your Kidsby Christy Lemire | November 17, 2017 |  CommentsWarner Bros.’ blockbuster DC superhero movie is going to&nbsp;attract a lot of fans this weekend, and chances are your kids will want to be among them, clutching their Batman and Wonder Woman action figures to their chests as they file into the theater. Christy Lemire offers the lowdown on exactly how PG-13 this PG-13 movie is, and she also let’s us know what to expect from YA novel-based tearjerker&nbsp;Wonder and animated nativity tale&nbsp;The Star.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Justice League (2017)  40%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi violence and action.The MPAA rating you see above is a serious understatement. Justice League&nbsp;is one of the more intensely, consistently violent and graphic comic book movies I’ve seen. It’s right up there with its predecessor, last year’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, in terms of destruction and carnage – relentlessly, numbingly so. BvS&nbsp;and Man of Steel&nbsp;director Zack Snyder returns (with some help from Joss Whedon in finishing the film after a family tragedy), this time to assemble a team of DC Comics superheroes to fight a powerful villain. Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and a back-from-the-dead Superman (Henry Cavill) must prevent the fearsome Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds) from turning the planet into a fiery hellscape. Massive fight sequences abound, some of which take place on Wonder Woman’s island Themyscira and Aquaman’s underwater home of Atlantis. Because this is a Snyder film, much of the mayhem is rendered in slow motion with a wide variety of weaponry, so you can really see what’s happening in those moments; other sequences, however, are a blur of visual effects and noise. The opening sequence finds a bunch of teachers and children under attack by gunmen, but simply what turns young Victor Stone into Cyborg is potentially disturbing enough. I did not bring my 8-year-old son (who’s seen a lot of these movies) with me to the screening, and I was glad about that afterward. As far as your kids go, I’d say it’s OK for viewers around 11 or 12 and older.Wonder (2017)  86%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements including bullying and some mild language.What a wonderful surprise this movie is. On the surface it looks mawkish and cringe inducing, but for the most part, director and co-writer Stephen Chbosky tells a story that’s earnest and inspiring without being too sentimental. (He does go a little overboard with the rousing conclusion, however.) Based on R.J. Palacio’s Young Adult novel of the same name, Wonder&nbsp;stars Jacob Tremblay (Room) as a bright, sweet 10-year-old named Auggie who was born with a genetic abnormality that’s required multiple facial surgeries and treatments to fix. His mom (Julia Roberts) has homeschooled him, but decides with her husband (Owen Wilson) to send Auggie to a Brooklyn middle school to teach him how to function in the outside world. Auggie endures their stares and rude questions and doesn’t have many friends at first. Soon enough, the mean kids are bullying him: calling him names, leaving insulting notes on his desk and in his locker and snubbing him at lunchtime. How he withstands it all with dignity – and how his fellow students eventually embrace him – is the crux of the film. Wonder&nbsp;offers important lessons about being kind, openhearted and generally decent to others, because you never know what they’re going through themselves. A great choice for all ages.The Star (2017)  42%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements.This is a really awkward combination of stuff. It’s an animated movie about the nativity, but it’s told through talking animals using anachronistic dialogue and updated pop versions of classic Christmas tunes. The all-star cast – which includes Oprah Winfrey, Keegan-Michael Key, Kelly Clarkson, Christopher Plummer, Kristen Chenoweth and Tyler Perry – is stuck juggling lame jokes and earnest, on-the-nose religious sentiments. It’s basically the story of Christ’s birth, told from the perspective of a donkey (voiced by Steven Yuen) who guides Mary (Gina Rodriguez) and Joseph (Zachary Levi) to the manger with the help of a bright star lighting up the night sky. Kids may wonder how Mary got pregnant, so you have that talk to look forward to. There’s some slapsticky physical humor, mostly involving the donkey falling off cliffs and roofs and such. Key provides the voice of his wacky sidekick, a dove who likes to twerk. A couple of mean dogs (voiced by Ving Rhames and Gabriel Iglesias), working for King Herod, are after Mary’s baby. They might seem a little scary for very young viewers. And there are some harmless donkey butt jokes. It’s not very good, but it’s fine for viewers around 5 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"leads","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/17194955/Justice-League-PG.jpg","slug":"justice-league-might-be-too-intense-for-your-kids"},{"id":"47508903800641","title":"In Case It Wasn’t Obvious, It Is Not for Kids","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})In Case It Wasn't Obvious, It Is Not for Kidsby Christy Lemire | September 8, 2017 |  CommentsThe new big-screen adaptation of Stephen King’s&nbsp;It is, by most accounts, pretty great, and it features a likable cast of kids in what looks like a coming-of-age film… with a creepy clown. It may be tempting to think it’s harmless enough to take your kids to, but you may want to read Christy’s assessment of it — and the new Reese Witherspoon rom-com — before you do that.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;It (2017)  86%Rating: R, for&nbsp;violence/horror, bloody images, and for language.Just wanted to make sure we’re all on the same page here regarding It. Because even though it’s about a bunch of kids, and it’s got a clown, It&nbsp;is definitely not for younger viewers. It may not be for older viewers, either, if you have trouble watching horror movies (or you have a phobia of clowns, which is totally understandable, because they’re creepy). The latest adaptation of Stephen King’s iconic novel follows a group of 11-year-old misfits as they investigate a series of child disappearances in small-town Maine. Each of them also gets unwelcome visits from Pennywise, the dancing clown (Bill Skarsgard), who uses his supernatural powers to torment them with whatever frightens them most. The images in director Andy Muschietti’s film can be harrowing and the children are in constant danger. From the very start, we see kids being attacked, often in bloody fashion. There’s also a disturbing subplot involving the girl in the group and her abusive father. The frights are powerful, but even more effective is the camaraderie between the well-chosen cast of young stars. One of the most believable elements of It is the way they talk – affectionately making fun of each other, often with profanity and sexual humor, as they try to act more mature than they really are to hide their fear. Anyway, it’s great, but it’s just not great for anyone younger than 14 or 15.Home Again (2017)  32%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some sexual and thematic material.Reese Witherspoon returns to romantic comedy, starring as a mother of two who goes back to her hometown of Los Angeles after separating from her husband (Michael Sheen). She moves back into her childhood home, and after a night of partying on her 40th&nbsp;birthday, invites three aspiring (and much younger) filmmakers to live in her guesthouse. They all form a makeshift family, which gets complicated with romantic entanglements. There’s a lot of kissing and discussion of sex, especially as Witherspoon’s character becomes increasingly involved with the cutest of the three young men, an overconfident director played by Pico Alexander. There’s also a ton of drinking, including the night she meets these guys and extending to long, wine-soaked evenings with her best girlfriends. There’s also a bit of violence, but it’s supposed to be comical. We see a bag of medical marijuana (briefly) and hear scattered language. And throughout the first film from writer-director Hallie Meyers-Shyer, there are adult discussions of a marriage dissolving. OK for viewers around 12 or 13 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"cartoon, prank, RT, Kimmy, Disney, Starz, in","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/08115603/IT-PG.jpg","slug":"in-case-it-wasnt-obvious-it-is-not-for-kids"},{"id":"47508904958801","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Everything, Everything and Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Everything, Everything and Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul?by Christy Lemire | May 19, 2017 |  CommentsTwo of this week’s big movies are directed squarely at younger audiences, but one of them, a teen weepie, is rated PG-13. Find out what you need to know about whether it’s suitable for the younger kids, as well as how much bodily function humor figures into the latest&nbsp;Wimpy Kid movie.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Everything, Everything (2017)  45%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for thematic elements and brief sensuality.Nicola Yoon’s best-selling Young Adult novel of the same name gets the big-screen treatment in this sweet and slightly sappy romantic drama. Amandla Stenberg stars as Maddy, a young woman who’s just turned 18. But she’s never left her high-tech Los Angeles home because she suffers from a rare immune deficiency that makes her highly susceptible to illness. It’s just her and her doctor mother (Anika Noni Rose) – until a cute boy moves in next door and piques her interest in exploring the outside world. Maddy and Nick Robinson’s Olly enjoy a lengthy phone flirtation until they dare to meet in person – which only makes them fall faster and harder for each other. Director Stella Meghie’s film is part of the same genre as A Walk in the Woods&nbsp;and The Fault in Their Stars&nbsp;– teen weepies in which the possibility of death is imminent, which magnifies the characters’ adolescent yearnings and anxieties. Maddy and Olly make some impulsive and potentially dangerous decisions, and there’s the suggestion that they’ve had sex. All we see is a lot of kissing, though. There’s a little bit of language and a couple of health scares. But Everything, Everything&nbsp;has stronger writing and acting than most of these movies, and the hugely appealing Stenberg and Robinson share a crackling chemistry. Tweens will love it.Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (2017)  18%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some rude humor.This is the one where the Heffleys inadvertently adopt a baby pig from a country fair, for those of you who are Diary of a Wimpy Kid&nbsp;experts. (Surely, I am not the only one with a 7-year-old out there.) The fourth movie in the series, inspired by Jeff Kinney’s wildly popular books, finds middle-schooler Greg (Jason Drucker, leading an all-new cast) climbing in the minivan with his family to celebrate their Meemaw’s 90th birthday. Madcap hilarity and hackneyed road-trip hijinks ensue. The Long Haul&nbsp;gets a PG rating “for some rude humor,” but there’s actually quite a bit of it throughout. Scatological gags involving pee, poop and amusement park puke abound. It’s not offensive, per se, but it’s also not particularly funny. Returning director David Bowers, who co-wrote the script with Kinney himself, stops everything to construct a lengthy and loving homage to the iconic shower scene from Psycho, a reference you may have to explain to your kids afterward. Also, Greg gains Internet infamy (and subsequent shame) as the star of a gross-out meme. And he and big-brother Rodrick (Charlie Wright) lie to their parents (Alicia Silverstone and Tom Everett Scott) by reprogramming the GPS to get closer to a video game convention. Eventually, though, The Long Haul is about perseverance, forgiveness and family togetherness. It’s also not nearly as good as the first three films. But it’s fine for kids around 7 or 8 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;xXx: Return of Xander Cage (2017)  44%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for extended sequences of gunplay and violent action, and for sexual material and language.Kids around 10 or 11 and older will be fine witnessing the triumphant return of Xander Cage. It’s been 15 years since Vin Diesel last played the character in a xXx&nbsp;movie, and although he’s creeping toward AARP age, he’s more extreme than ever. This time, his Cage must emerge from his self-imposed exile to find a device known as Pandora’s Box, which can make satellites fall from the sky with the push of a button. It doesn’t really matter what it does – it’s the McGuffin, an excuse to show Cage and his ragtag band of badass cohorts zooming around on skateboards and motorcycles and jumping out of planes and whatnot. Director D.J. Caruso’s film is silly and over the top, but at least it’s self-aware. Expect a ton of gunfire, with untold number of bad guys getting shot dead. But because this is a PG-13 movie, we don’t see any blood, with the exception of one killing. Cage is also a ladies man besides being a globetrotting adventurer, so we see him cavorting with several scantily clad beauties, including the suggestion of an orgy in a London penthouse. And there’s quite a bit of language throughout the film. Everything about this movie, from the violence to the sex, is rather cartoonish, though.The Space Between Us (2017)  16%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for brief sensuality and language.Viewers around 10 and up should be OK with this sci-fi romance, which is essentially a Muppet Babies&nbsp;version of Starman. A curious 16-year-old named Gardner Elliot (Asa Butterfield) has spent his whole life on Mars. His mother, an astronaut, was secretly pregnant when she boarded the ship to help establish a colony there, so the red planet is all he’s known. But he’s somehow struck up an online friendship with a similarly isolated, frustrated teenage girl named Tulsa (Britt Robertson), who lives in Colorado. He finagles a trip to Earth to meet her – and find out the identity of his father – but his body may not be able to withstand the journey. Director Peter Chelsom’s film, from the writer of the ridiculous Collateral Beauty, Allan Loeb, is similarly unintentionally hilarious. But it’s not entirely inappropriate for your kids. Gardner and Tulsa go on the run and are frequently in peril. They steal several cars to travel across the country. And there’s some kissing, as well as the suggestion of more inside a sleeping bag under the stars.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Pet, richard, Marvel, ABC, Esquire, Exclusive, service, demand","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19125342/Everything-Everything-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-everything-everything-and-diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-the-long-haul"},{"id":"47508902249274","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Thor: Ragnarok and Lady Bird?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Thor: Ragnarok and Lady Bird?by Christy Lemire | November 3, 2017 |  CommentsOf course, if your kids have grown up watching Marvel movies, they’re going to want to see the latest installment of the&nbsp;Thor franchise, especially since it’s so colorful and zany. Christy lets you know what to look out for in that film, and she goes out of her way to recommend a couple of others for older kids and teens. Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok (2017)  93%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and brief suggestive material.The latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a complete blast from start to finish: cheeky, snappy and self-referential. The threat of cataclysmic mayhem hovers over the proceedings at all times, but director Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows, Eagle vs. Shark) somehow manages to keep things brisk, light, and frequently zany. And he’s got an excellent cast to work with here. This time, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must team up with his old friend and fellow Avenger, Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and an alcoholic bounty hunter (a charismatic Tessa Thompson) to stop the villainous goddess of death, Hela (Cate Blanchett), from triggering the predicted destruction known as Ragnarok. As is so often the case in these comic-book blockbusters, there are massive battle sequences in which entire armies of men perish, but their deaths are quick and bloodless. At the film’s start, Thor must take on a huge, fiery monster, which might seem scary for younger viewers. Thor and Hulk also brutally battle each other in a coliseum setting. While Blanchett is clearly having a blast camping and vamping it up as Hela, she also might be frightening to littler kids. And there’s a scattering of profanity throughout. I brought my 8-year-old son to a screening and he loved it, but there was one image involving Thor’s eye that he found disturbing. But if your kids are familiar with these characters and this world, they’ll have a great time. Fine for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.Lady Bird (2017)  99%Rating: R, for language, sexual content, brief graphic nudity, and teen partying.It’s rated R, but Lady Bird is so beautifully written and acted – so achingly sweet and true – that I wanted to recommend it here. Greta Gerwig’s feature directing debut is semi-autobiographical, but even if you didn’t know that going in, you’d quickly realize how intimate and personal her film is. Saoirse Ronan stars as the title character – or, rather, that’s the name the high school senior has given herself to feel more exotic in the mundane suburbs of Sacramento, California. (Her real name is Christine.) Lady Bird&nbsp;is a coming-of-age movie, with all the mistakes and heartaches that would suggest. There’s frank talk about sex and eventually we see her lose her virginity; Lady Bird actually has a couple of different boyfriends during the course of the movie. There’s also teen partying – drinking and smoking – as well as language throughout. But this is such an insightful film with such a lovely performance from Ronan – perhaps a career best from the two-time Oscar nominee – that I’d highly recommend it for viewers around 13 or 14 and older as they’re enduring their own adolescent angst.Princess Cyd (2017)  95%Rating: Not rated, but contains drinking, some drug material, language, sexuality, nudity and mature situations.Like Lady Bird, Princess Cyd&nbsp;is a refreshingly honest, realistic look at a teenager navigating a pivotal period in her life. Jessie Pinnick stars as Cyd, a 16-year-old who goes to live with her novelist aunt (Rebecca Spence) in Chicago for a few weeks during the summer. While she’s there, she learns more about her mother (who was her aunt’s sister), who died tragically 10 years earlier. She also learns about herself when she becomes involved romantically with an outgoing, confident lesbian (Malic White) who’s the barista at the neighborhood coffee bar. There’s quite a bit of kissing, some nudity and one sex scene, but it isn’t graphic. Cyd also shares a joint (and some kisses) with a handsome young man who’s a friend of her aunt’s and drinks some champagne at a party. And there’s the suggestion that a character is the victim of an attempted sexual assault. But there’s so much to recommend here. Writer-director Stephen Cone’s film unfolds naturally, with an effortless sense of place and well-drawn characters. Some of the material may be too grown-up for tweens, but this would be an excellent choice for viewers around 13 or 14 and older.New on DVD&nbsp;The Dark Tower (2017)  16%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;thematic material including sequences of gun violence and action.This Stephen King adaptation wasn’t exactly a giant hit when it came out this summer – it made a disappointing $51 million domestically – but if your kids are curious about catching up with it, it’s probably OK for tweens and older. The long-awaited feature-film version of the revered King series will be too much for younger viewers, yet not enough for everyone else. It’s about portals and time travel and monsters and gun battles, but while the original mythology is dense, director Nikolaj Arcel’s adaptation of it feels truncated and rushed. Idris Elba stars as the legendary Gunslinger, who’s long been searching for the devilish Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) to keep him from destroying the Dark Tower, which stands in the middle of the universe to protect against evil forces. Only the psychically gifted Jake (Tom Taylor), a misfit Manhattan kid who’s had visions of such destruction, can save us all. While the visual effects often look muddled, the violence within them is unmistakable: vicious beasts that attack out of nowhere; fiery, hellish images of mass suffering; prolonged gun fights that result in many casualties. Children are abducted from around the world and placed in torturous devices to do the Man in Black’s bidding. Both Jake and the Gunslinger must deal with the deaths of people who are important to them. And McConaughey’s character also has psychic powers, which he usually uses to kill people. Overall, it’s not very good, but it is very intense.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Skip","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/03122012/Thor-Ragnarok-Hela-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-thor-ragnarok-and-lady-bird"},{"id":"47508904957776","title":"How Family-Friendly Is Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales?by Christy Lemire | May 26, 2017 |  CommentsThe latest in Disney’s&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean franchise hits theaters this week, and despite its PG-13 rating, there’s a decent chance your younger kids might want to see it. Christy Lemire lets us know what to expect from all the spooky ghost pirating, as well as a few new choices on DVD.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017)  30%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of adventure violence, and some suggestive content.The fifth (fifth?!) movie in the Pirates of the Caribbean&nbsp;franchise once again finds the infamous Jack Sparrow drunkenly stumbling his way from one high-seas adventure to the next. Johnny Depp dons the eyeliner and pirate gear yet again to play one of his signature roles, but this time he does it alongside a new crew of co-stars. Jack reluctantly teams up with Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), son of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, and the scrappy astronomer Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) to find the trident of Poseidon. It’s supposed to break curses, or something. Along the way, they must contend with various enemies, including old foe Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and a ship full of ghost pirates led by the frightening Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem). And that’s the part that might be too scary for very young viewers. Salazar and his crew are all stuck in a state of decay, with body parts missing and black goo oozing from their mouths (if they still have mouths, that is). It’s a cool and extremely creepy effect. There’s all the obligatory swashbuckling and explosions you’d expect from the series. But Jack and Carina are also nearly executed in a town square, and there’s some suggestive material that probably will go over kids’ heads. I took my 7-year-old son (who hadn’t seen any of the previous movies) to a screening and he didn’t find anything disturbing. He actually really liked it, thanks in large part to the slapsticky comedy. Fine for viewers around 7 or 8 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Great Wall (2017)  35%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of fantasy action violence.Kids around 11 or 12 and older should be fine watching this 3-D action extravaganza — the most expensive movie ever made entirely in China, with a reported budget around $150 million. Chinese master Zhang Yimou offers an alternative history of the origin of the Great Wall of China: Apparently, it was built all those centuries ago to keep out ravenous hordes of marauding monsters. Zhang’s first English-language film is massive, with elaborate production design, an enormous cast and high-tech special effects. At the center of it all is Matt Damon as an Irish mercenary who learns to be a part of something larger than himself when he joins an elite force of Chinese warriors to fend off these hideous creatures. And that’s why The Great Wall&nbsp;will be way too intense for younger kids. The monsters look like a speedier, angrier version of the Jurassic Park dinosaurs, with gnashing teeth reminiscent of the Alien&nbsp;franchise. Zhang shows them to us at a distance, moving as an organized pack, but also up close and personal as they rip individual soldiers to shreds. He creates sweeping battle scenes full of swords, arrows and explosives. Even though it’s all computer-generated imagery, it’s scary and gory.Rock Dog (2017)  47%Rating:&nbsp;PG for action and language.This animated comedy about a dog who dreams of being a rock star is fine for the whole family. Adults, however, will find it vaguely more than tolerable – although the soundtrack featuring songs from Radiohead, Beck, and the Foo Fighters is solid. Luke Wilson lends his voice to a Tibetan Mastiff named Bodi, who’s forced to follow in the footsteps of his father (J.K. Simmons) in protecting Snow Mountain – with its wool-making sheep — from the threat of wolves who’d like to devour them all. But Bodi has dreams of musical greatness, which he pursues when he visits the big city to track down Angus Scattergood (Eddie Izzard), an egotistical cat who’s a reclusive rock legend. The wolves are predatory but bumbling, and the possibility of real danger is brief and played for laughs. There’s a slight bit of mild language from Angus, a saucy British cat. (Izzard’s performance is the best part of the whole movie.) But the idea of being true to yourself and following your dreams – while trite – is worthwhile.My Life as a Zucchini (Ma vie de courgette) (2017)  99%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for thematic elements and suggestive material.Viewers around 9 and older should be fine watching this incredibly beautiful, deeply moving film, which was nominated for the Academy Award for best animated feature. But despite the cute title and the pleasingly colorful, rough-hewn look of the characters, My Life As a Zucchini&nbsp;isn’t for little kids. It’s about children who’ve suffered greatly in their young lives, with parents who’ve died or are incapable of caring for them because they’re in prison or addicted to drugs. But it’s also about these kids’ resiliency, the sweet way they look out for each other and the possibility of finding new families. I saw the original version of Swiss director Claude Barras’ stop-motion animation film in French with subtitles; a dubbed, English-language version starring Nick Offerman, Ellen Page and Will Forte came out in theaters in February and is now available on DVD. A 9-year-old boy who goes by the nickname Zucchini ends up at a foster home after his mother’s death, for which he blames himself. He meets and befriends other kids who are there for a variety of reasons, but he also must endure the cruelty of a bully. There’s some language and adolescent sexual humor. While the thematic sadness might be too much for some young kids to handle, it’s an inspired film with a message that’s ultimately hopeful.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"dogs, versus, History","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/26122958/Pirates-Dead-Men-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales"},{"id":"47508903857992","title":"How Family-Friendly are Dunkirk and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Dunkirk and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets?by Christy Lemire | July 21, 2017 |  CommentsYou may be itching to see Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed new war epic, and you might be tempted to take your kids, considering it’s rated PG-13. But before you do that, have a look at what film critic — and mother — Christy Lemire has to say about it, plus her thoughts on Luc Besson’s colorful and bizarre space adventure, in case your kids see the trailers and beg you to see it.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Dunkirk (2017)  92%Rating: PG-13, for intense war experience and some language.Christopher Nolan’s World War II drama is a masterful, compact pressure cooker of tension and technical prowess. It’s at once intimate and epic – deceptively simple yet dazzling with the kind of complex narrative that’s long been a signature of the writer-director of Memento, Inception&nbsp;and the Dark Knight&nbsp;trilogy. From a trio of interwoven perspectives, Nolan depicts the evacuation of the beach at Dunkirk as Allied soldiers found themselves surrounded and forced to flee. Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, and Harry Styles are among the players whose fates intersect. Dunkirk&nbsp;features nearly non-stop violence and peril, as you would expect from a war picture. The soldiers are under attack from the air, ground and sea. Many characters (and extras) are shot to death, but there’s barely any blood. And there’s surprisingly only a bit of language, but that includes the one F-word you get in a PG-13 movie. Mostly, though, the unrelenting suspense on display here is what may disturb younger viewers. That, and the noise – the sound design is exquisite, but the gunfire is very loud, as are the screams as men find themselves trapped, abandoning ships, drowning or burning to death. I brought my 7 ½-year-old son to see it in IMAX (because I’m that kind of mom, and because he can handle heavier material); the one scene that bothered him takes place in a boat as men are being shot at and drowning. Mostly, though, I’d say this is OK for mature tweens and older. And at an hour and 46 minutes, it’s surprisingly short.Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)  47%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;sci-fi violence and action, suggestive material and brief language.Good lord, this is a strange movie. Deliriously, delightfully strange, but still. It won’t be to everyone’s taste but it’s certainly never dull, and it’s frequently a lot of fun. This shiny, colorful extravaganza from sci-fi master Luc Besson is an intergalactic roller coaster ride with bits of snappy (albeit clunky) romantic banter tossed in between. It starts out hundreds of years in the future with the fiery destruction of a beach planet where parents watch their alien daughter perish. But the main story focuses on humans: a special ops team (Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne) trying to determine the origin of a hidden force buried deep within Alpha, the aforementioned City of a Thousand Planets. They also have to babysit a rare, miniature dinosaur that poops out powerful pearls. No, really. Characters are constantly in danger, and there are several outer (and inner) space battle scenes. Eventually, Rihanna shows up as an eager-to-please shape-shifter who performs a sexually suggestive dance sequence in a brothel. No, really. There’s a mind-boggling variety of creatures — some of them cute, some of them bizarre, some of them just plain off-putting. At 2 hours and 17 minutes, Valerian&nbsp;will be a long sit for younger kids. And even though it’s based on an influential comic book series, you might find it hard to follow, regardless of your age. OK for mature tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Kong: Skull Island (2017)  75%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for brief strong language.Kids around 9 or 10 and older will love this big, dumb monster movie — and I say that as a total compliment. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ action epic has the spirit of a classic Ray Harryhausen film with the benefit of high-tech special effects. It’s about a group of explorers who visit an uncharted island in the South Pacific in 1973 and find more danger than they ever could have imagined. They include an expert tracker (Tom Hiddleston), a war photographer (Brie Larson), the head of a shadowy government agency (John Goodman) and a military team with a no-nonsense leader (Samuel L. Jackson). But you’re not here for the people. You’re here to see King Kong, who rules the island as a fearsome and deadly but ultimately gentle giant. This is not a spoiler: If you’ve ever seen any incarnation of King Kong, you know he’s misunderstood. But he might be super-scary for very little kids, especially as he battles the many other oversized monsters that happen to call this island home. (What’s in the water surrounding this place anyway?) I brought my 7-year-old son to see Kong: Skull Island&nbsp;when it came out theatrically and he had a blast. It is pretty intense, though, with a lot of violence, gunfire, monster action and helicopter destruction, and not everyone makes it out alive. There’s also quite a bit of language, including the one F-bomb you get in a PG-13 movie, courtesy of the great John C. Reilly.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"venice, rotten, Nat","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21113341/Dunkirk-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-dunkirk-and-valerian-and-the-city-of-a-thousand-planets"},{"id":"47508903880525","title":"How Family-Friendly Are 47 Meters Down, The Book of Henry, and Cars 3?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are 47 Meters Down, The Book of Henry, and Cars 3?by Christy Lemire | June 16, 2017 |  CommentsObviously, Pixar’s latest animated film about anthropomorphic autos is going to be fine for kids. Let’s be honest here: the&nbsp;only reason they keep making them is because kids in particular love them. That said, we do have a couple of PG-13 offerings — a shark thriller and a somewhat dark coming-of-age drama — might be a little harder to suss out. Read on for Christy’s take on all three, as well as a couple of new DVDs.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Cars 3 (2017)  69%Rating:&nbsp;GThis is the third movie in Cars&nbsp;franchise, so you know what you’re in for here. It’s totally harmless for viewers of all ages, and not even remotely as complicated or challenging as the best of the Pixar universe. Cars 3&nbsp;once again centers on Lightning McQueen (voiced as always by Owen Wilson), who’s now finding that, as a veteran racer, he’s not nearly as fast as his newer, more high-tech competitors. He works with a younger, female trainer named Cruz (Cristela Alonzo), who had long dreamed of racing herself. Basically, it’s about middle-age angst, which should be super fun for all those little kids in the audience. Lightning suffers a couple of bad crashes, and he and Cruz find themselves in danger when they accidentally enter themselves in a demolition derby. But there’s nothing inappropriate here.The Book of Henry (2017)  22%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for thematic elements and brief strong language.Kids are the stars of this film, but you may not want to bring your own kids to see it – at least, not the younger ones. Jaeden Lieberher and Jacob Tremblay play brothers Henry and Peter, who live with their single mom (Naomi Watts) in small-town upstate New York. Henry, who’s brilliant beyond his 11 years, suspects that the sweet, pretty girl next door (Maddie Ziegler) is being abused by her stepfather, and devises an elaborate plan to rescue her. The film from director Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World) covers some very mature themes: molestation, alcoholism, illness, death, murder and suicide. The story takes some dramatic and potentially disturbing turns involving firearms and revenge. There’s quite a bit of language throughout – mainly from the mom, whose kids subsequently scold her for cursing. The mom’s best friend (Sarah Silverman) is often drinking or drunk. In general, this movie is just nutty and awesomely terrible, despite strong performances from its young actors. OK for viewers around 12 or 13 and older.47 Meters Down (2017)  52%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;sequences of intense, peril, bloody images, and brief strong language.This is an unabashed B-movie about beautiful young women in danger of becoming shark food. But 47 Meters Down&nbsp;is lean and mean, and it has some decent scares as well as some impressive underwater camerawork. Mandy Moore and Claire Holt co-star as sisters on a diving trip in Mexico in which they’re submerged in a cage to swim with great whites. But the cable tying them to the boat snaps, plunging them to the bottom of the ocean, where myriad dangers abound. This is a pretty intense little movie. People suffer shark bites and one character dies. It’s dark and scary down there, and the women are constantly aware that they could die at any moment. Understandably, they frequently panic – which depletes their oxygen supply faster, which makes them panic even more. There’s also quite a bit of cursing and a little bit of kissing. OK for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Lego Batman Movie (2017)  90%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for&nbsp;rude humor and some action.You probably saw this high-energy animated extravaganza when it came out this spring – it made more than $310 million worldwide. But the jokes are so rapid-fire, you also probably missed several of them the first time around. In this spin-off of 2014’s The Lego Movie, Batman (voiced once again with wonderfully gravelly arrogance by Will Arnett) fights to remain relevant as Gotham’s hero. He’s also struggling with an existential crisis, as the arrival of sidekick Robin (Michael Cera) forces him to accept the possibility that he might actually need a family. The humor is zippy and self-referential but never mean, and while there’s violence and destruction throughout, it’s silly and playful. This is a movie in which characters make “pew pew pew” noises while they’re firing at each other with plastic guns. Many villains show up from both comic books and other pop-culture realms, but they’re depicted in such a goofy way that they’re never scary. And ultimately, the themes of allowing people into your life to help you and creating your own sense of family are worthwhile. Awesome for all ages.3 Generations (2017)  32%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for mature thematic content, some sexual references and language.This well-intentioned indie drama is probably fine for viewers around 13 and older. It’s also a letdown, given its strong cast. Elle Fanning stars as Ray, a transgender teen living in New York City. He was born Ramona, but knew from a young age that he was a boy trapped in a girl’s body. Director and co-writer Gaby Dellal follows the conflict as Ray’s single mom (Naomi Watts) and lesbian grandmother (Susan Sarandon) struggle to accept his desire to transition fully through hormone therapy. It’s worthwhile subject matter for young people to learn more about, but quite a bit of the dialogue is mature and emotionally complicated. Several teenage characters discuss sex and body parts frankly in a bragging sort of way. We also see a couple of adult characters in bed after an afternoon tryst. And there’s quite a bit of language scattered throughout, including the one F-bomb allowed with a PG-13 rating. While the film itself skims the surface of a complex topic, it also has positive themes about communication and dedication.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"america, Sony, hispanic, Nominations, spider-man, in, drama, Guide, AMC, The, nature, Amazon, USA, Crunchyroll","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16114009/47-Meters-Down-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-47-meters-down-the-book-of-henry-and-cars-3"},{"id":"47508904954703","title":"Wonder Woman Might Be Too Violent for Your Kids","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Wonder Woman Might Be Too Violent for Your Kidsby Christy Lemire | June 2, 2017 |  CommentsThere are two superhero movies coming out this weekend, but one of them is an animated feature based on a series of children’s books about a not-so-super hero who traipses around in his unmentionables. The other movie — one you&nbsp;might have heard something about lately — is the latest entry in the DC Extended Universe, and Christy is here to let you know which side of PG-13 it sits on. Read on for all the details on the two wide releases, plus a couple of new DVDs.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Wonder Woman (2017)  93%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of violence and action, and some suggestive content.So many parent friends of mine – with little girls, especially – have asked me whether this big-screen version of Wonder Woman&nbsp;is suitable for their kids. And the answer, as much as I hate to say it, is: probably not. Not yet, at least. Don’t get me wrong – it’s great. But it’s also extremely violent. The origin story of Diana Prince (a hugely charismatic Gal Gadot), the Amazon warrior who’d become a superhero, is both thrilling and moving. Director Patty Jenkins has pulled off a tricky balance of humor, heart, and high-tech spectacle that’s genuinely inspiring. But Wonder Woman also features several long, graphic action sequences. There’s a ton of gunfire, swordplay, and hand-to-hand combat. Several characters die, and while there isn’t a lot of blood (hence the PG-13 rating), the movie definitely doesn’t shy away from showing the actual deaths. We see people in peril – including women and children — during World War I battles. In one scene, a room full of bad guys perish from poisonous gas. There’s also the suggestion of a sex scene between Diana and Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), the American spy she rescues from a crash landing, but all we see is kissing in a hotel room. At over two hours, Wonder Woman&nbsp;also might be too long for many young viewers. I brought my 7 ½-year-old son with me and he was fine, but he’s also seen a) a lot of movies in general, and b) a lot of comic-book movies specifically. (He also loved it – and he wasn’t so enthusiastic about seeing it beforehand.) But Diana is heroic and brave, idealistic and pure, she’s usually the smartest and most capable person in the room or on the battlefield. That’s all worthwhile. But I suspect this would be too much just yet for viewers younger than 8 or 9.Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (Captain Underpants) (2017)  87%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for mild rude humor throughout.If your kids are fans of the Captain Underpants books, they will love this movie. They will be laughing hysterically throughout the entire thing, and they’ll be singing its unlikely superhero’s catch phrase – “Tra la laaa!” – as they leave the theater. The good news is, as a parent, you’ll have a blast, too – whether or not you’re familiar with the Captain Underpants extended universe. Director David Soren’s film, written by Nicholas Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall,&nbsp;Get Him to the Greek), draws from a few of author Dav Pilkey’s hugely popular books. It introduces best friends George (voiced by Kevin Hart) and Harold (Thomas Middleditch), who spend their days designing comic books and plotting elaborate pranks at their elementary school. But one day they go too far, and they turn their mean principal, Mr. Krupp (Ed Helms), into the comic hero of their dreams: Captain Underpants. Nothing in here is vaguely inappropriate – unless you have a problem with jokes about poop, pee, farts and toilets. And Captain Underpants actually has a valuable message about being kind to people who are friendless or who’ve been bullied. But mostly it’s about potty humor. Fine for all ages.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Shack (2017)  21%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for thematic material including some violence.Viewers around 11 or 12 and older should be OK here, even though it’s about pretty grown-up stuff. This weepy religious film is based on a New York Times best seller about a father (Sam Worthington) who goes on a spiritual journey after the tragic loss of his young daughter (Amelie Eve). The little girl is kidnapped and killed during a family camping trip, leaving him bereft and faithless and eroding his relationships with his wife (Radha Mitchell) and two other kids (Megan Charpentier and Gage Munroe). Then one day, a mysterious note in his mailbox leads him back to the scene of the crime – and to an idyllic shack in the woods where he meets God (Octavia Spencer), Jesus (Aviv Alush), and the Holy Spirit (Sumire Matsubara). Thematically alone, this is too much for very young viewers to handle. We see visions of the young girl being carried away, and we witness the father’s pain and remorse. There’s also a scene in which another kid nearly drowns and requires CPR. And at over two hours, the running time alone will make this a tough sit for kids.Before I Fall (2017)  64%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for mature thematic content involving drinking, sexuality, bullying, some violent images, and language – all involving teens.Young teens and older should be fine watching this angsty but well-acted high school drama. Think Groundhog Day&nbsp;meets Heathers.&nbsp;Zoey Deutch stars as a popular high school senior who wakes up the morning after a raging party to find she’s living the previous day all over again. Then it happens the next morning, and the next. And it keeps happening, over and over, regardless of the slight tweaks she makes to jar herself loose from this time loop. In the process, she learns to see her mean-girl friends more clearly and treasure what’s truly important in life. Director Ry Russo-Young’s film features a ton of language and frank talk about sex. Teens also get super drunk at the party Deutch’s character and her friends attend, and they bully an awkward girl who shows up uninvited. And there’s a major car accident that serves as an important plot point, which we see again and again from various perspectives.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"TV, VICE, Food, Nat","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/02101958/Wonder-Woman-PG.jpg","slug":"wonder-woman-might-be-too-violent-for-your-kids"},{"id":"47508906088288","title":"How Family-Friendly are The Space Between Us and Rings?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are The Space Between Us and Rings?by Christy Lemire | February 3, 2017 |  CommentsBoth of the big movies this week are rated PG-13, which means the kids may be tugging on your sleeves to go see them. Read on for the lowdown on a teen space romance and the latest in the Ring horror franchise.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Space Between Us (2017)  16%Rating: PG-13, for brief sensuality and language.This sci-fi romance plays like a Muppet Babies version of Starman. An inquisitive 16-year-old named Gardner Elliot (Asa Butterfield) has spent his entire young life on Mars. His mother, an astronaut, was secretly pregnant when she boarded the ship to help establish a colony there; the red planet is all he’s known. But he’s somehow struck up an online friendship with a similarly isolated, frustrated teenage girl named Tulsa (Britt Robertson), who lives in Colorado. He finagles a trip to Earth to meet her – and find out the identity of his father – but his body may not be able to withstand the journey. Director Peter Chelsom’s film, from a screenplay by Collateral Beauty&nbsp;writer Allan Loeb, is unintentionally hilarious, but not entirely unsuitable for your kids. Gardner and Tulsa go on the run and are frequently in peril. They steal several cars to travel across the country. And there’s some kissing, as well as the suggestion of more inside a sleeping bag under the stars. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 10 and older.Rings (2017)  8%Rating: PG-13, for violence/terror, thematic elements, some sexuality and brief drug material.The latest movie in the Japanese-inspired Ring franchise may not seem all that scary if you’ve seen the previous horror movies. It’s basically more of the same, only with updated technology. But it’s probably too much for your kids to handle. This sorta-sequel, sorta-reboot finds the infamous VHS tape resurfacing at a flea market. That’s where a college professor (Johnny Galecki) finds it; later, he makes the mistake of watching it. Of course, the trick is to find someone else to watch it to get the deadly, seven-day curse off of you. This drags in various unsuspecting innocents, including a freshman student (Alex Roe) and the loyal girlfriend he left back home (Matilda Lutz). The jumpy, grainy imagery remains vaguely creepy: the sight of the stringy-haired girl climbing out the well and the subsequent, paralyzing effect her presence has on her victims. Lutz’s character does some ill-advised exploring in the dark basement of an abandoned church, where she sees disturbing visions of what happened there years earlier. And Galecki’s character lights a joint before popping the tape in for the first time. I’d say this is OK for kids around 12 or 13 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016)  38%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of violence and action, some bloody images, language and thematic elements.Jack Reacher never stops never stopping – and that should be OK for viewers around 12 or 13 and older. The sequel to 2012’s Jack Reacher&nbsp;finds Tom Cruise pummeling more bad guys – and running, always running — even as his character is suspected of being a bad guy himself. This time, he teams up with Cobie Smulders, who plays an old friend accused of espionage. Brutal fight sequences, thrilling action set pieces and considerable carnage ensue. Characters get shot and beaten to death in director Edward Zwick’s film, which is once again based on a Lee Child novel. But because this is PG-13 violence, there isn’t exactly a realistic amount of bloodshed. There’s also some language scattered throughout, the suggestion of drugs, and a grown-up subplot about whether Reacher has a daughter he never knew.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Premium, kids, Studios, cartoon, Emmys, scorecard, stand-up, Legendary, slashers, Film, Extras, Nickelodeon, Searchlight, FX, BET","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/03112531/Rings-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-the-space-between-us-and-rings"},{"id":"47508904979293","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Rock Dog and My Life as a Zucchini?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Rock Dog and My Life as a Zucchini?by Christy Lemire | February 24, 2017 |  CommentsBoth of the movies Christy covers in this week’s Parental Guidance are animated features, but while one of them is a zippy kid’s movie with familiar touches, the other is an Oscar-nominated stop-motion film that might be a little too mature for younger audiences.&nbsp;Read on for details on both.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Rock Dog (2017)  47%Rating: PG, for action and language.Children of all ages should be fine watching this animated comedy about a dog (voiced by Luke Wilson) who dreams of being a rock star. Adults, meanwhile, will find it vaguely more than tolerable – although the soundtrack featuring songs from Radiohead, Beck, and the Foo Fighters is solid. Wilson lends his voice to a Tibetan Mastiff named Bodi, who’s forced to follow in the footsteps of his father (J.K. Simmons) in protecting Snow Mountain – with its wool-making sheep — from the threat of wolves who’d like to devour them all. But Bodi has dreams of musical greatness, which he pursues when he visits the big city to track down Angus Scattergood (Eddie Izzard), an egotistical cat who’s a reclusive rock legend. The wolves are predatory but bumbling, and the possibility of real danger is brief and played for laughs. There’s a slight bit of mild language from Angus, a saucy British cat. (Izzard’s performance is the best part of the whole movie.) But the idea of being true to yourself and following your dreams – while trite – is worthwhile. Fine for the whole family.My Life as a Zucchini (Ma vie de courgette) (2017)  99%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and suggestive material.This incredibly beautiful, deeply moving film is nominated for the Academy Award for best animated feature. But despite the cute title and the pleasingly colorful, rough-hewn look of the characters, My Life as a Zucchini really isn’t for little kids. It’s about children who’ve suffered greatly in their young lives, with parents who’ve died or are incapable of caring for them because they’re in prison or addicted to drugs. But it’s also about these kids’ resiliency, the sweet way they look out for each other and the possibility of finding new families. I saw the original version of Swiss director Claude Barras’ stop-motion animation film in French with subtitles, but a dubbed, English-language version starring Nick Offerman, Ellen Page, and Will Forte is in theaters this weekend. A 9-year-old boy who goes by the nickname Zucchini ends up at a foster home after his mother’s death, for which he blames himself. He meets and befriends other kids who are there for a variety of reasons, but he also must endure the cruelty of a bully. There’s some language and adolescent sexual humor. But overall, the thematic sadness might be too much for some young kids to handle. Still, it’s an inspired film with a message that’s ultimately hopeful. Fine for kids around 9 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"rings, TV, psycho, Oscars, Starz, TV, cartoon, RT21","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24154943/Rock-Dog-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-rock-dog-and-my-life-as-a-zucchini"},{"id":"47508904971096","title":"How Family-Friendly are Ghost in the Shell, The Zookeeper’s Wife, and The Boss Baby?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Ghost in the Shell, The Zookeeper's Wife, and The Boss Baby?by Christy Lemire | March 31, 2017 |  CommentsIt’s pretty clear who the target audience is for the animated film&nbsp;The Boss Baby, even if it does feature Alec Baldwin making Glengarry Glen Ross&nbsp;references, but you may want to learn a little bit about the anime adaptation&nbsp;Ghost in the Shell&nbsp;and a Holocaust tale based on true events before you take the kids to them. Read on for Christy’s take.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Ghost in the Shell (2017)  43%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence, suggestive content and some disturbing images.Scarlett Johansson stars in this live-action version of the influential 1995 Japanese anime film about a futuristic society in which a young woman’s brain is placed in a synthetic body. Johansson’s Major is a trained killing machine, but she’s haunted by glimmers of memories of her human past, many of which are frightening. This is an extremely violent movie with punishing fight sequences, extended gun battles and major explosions. The world in which the characters live is dark and gloomy (despite bursts of high-tech color) and it’s full of danger. Much of the imagery is extremely creepy, such as the sight of a robot geisha being shot in the face. Also, there are many scenes in which it appears that Major is fighting while completely naked, but it’s actually just the way her flesh-colored “shell” was designed. And there’s a scene in a club with strippers, but we don’t see much. This movie gets a PG-13 rating but I’d say it’s really only suitable for more mature kids who are 13 and older.The Zookeeper's Wife (2017)  64%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements, disturbing images, violence, brief sexuality, nudity and smoking.Jessica Chastain stars in this true story about a couple who saved the lives of hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust by hiding them in the basement of the Warsaw zoo. Chastain’s Antonina Zabinski and her husband, Jan (Johan Heldenbergh), risked their lives and that of their young son by sneaking people out of the Warsaw ghetto and helping them find new lives. Director Niki Caro’s film is often extremely hard to watch. We see Nazi soldiers shoot people and animals to death. We witness Jews being herded onto trains on their way to concentration camps. One young woman is raped (although we don’t see the assault, it’s implied). A zoologist from Berlin (Daniel Bruhl), who initially pretends to be the couple’s ally, eventually reveals himself as a Nazi and tries to force himself on Antonina. There’s a ton of World War II violence, including shootouts, bombings and mass destruction. But The Zookeeper’s Wife&nbsp;is also a well-acted, inspiring story of heroism, courage and sacrifice. I’d say it’s suitable for viewers around age 12 and older.The Boss Baby (2017)  53%Rating: PG, for some mild rude humor.How to explain this bizarre animated comedy? Let’s give it a try. A 7-year-old boy named Tim (voiced by Miles Christopher Bakshi) is living a perfectly happy, suburban life with his mom (Lisa Kudrow) and dad (Jimmy Kimmel). Then one day, a baby brother arrives – and he’s wearing a suit, carrying a briefcase, tossing cash around and talking with the voice of Alec Baldwin. He’s an infant and a grown-up at the same time, and he’s here on a mission involving puppies and a rocket ship…? Anyway, it’s very confusing, but ultimately harmless. Tim has an active imagination, which leads to some wildly colorful fantasy sequences, but they’re more playful than scary. There are the obligatory diaper and potty jokes, and we see some naked baby butts. A trip to Las Vegas involves some slightly racy humor that kids won’t get. And a mad scientist holds Tim and the baby captive, briefly, but they ultimately save the day. Sorry, folks – that’s not exactly a spoiler. Fine for kids around 5 or 6 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016)  74%Rating: PG-13, for some fantasy action violence.Kids around 8 and older should be fine watching this spin-off of the Harry Potter universe. J.K. Rowling herself wrote the script – and David Yates, who directed the last four Potter movies, is at the helm – for this film inspired by one of the books that’s assigned reading for Harry and his friends at Hogwarts. Eddie Redmayne stars as Newt Scamander, a shy wizard who’s an expert in the field of magical beasts. He travels to New York in the mid-1920s to find a particular creature, but while he’s there, the other odd animals in his suitcase escape. While trying to track them down, he gets caught in a conflict between the wizards living secretly in New York and the Muggles (or No-Majs, as they’re known in the United States) hunting them down. Younger viewers will delight in the creative and colorful creatures’ amusing and often destructive antics. It takes place decades before the Harry Potter&nbsp;series, but features many recognizable details: wands, spells and references to various characters. But it’s also pretty dark, with scenes of children being abused by their adoptive, witch-hunting mother (Samantha Morton). An air of totalitarian fear hangs over everything. And a mysterious, frightening force wreaks havoc throughout the city: a dark gust of wind that can destroy an entire building in one swoop and leaves its victims battered with elaborate marks. That was the only element that disturbed my 7-year-old son, who’s an enthusiastic and knowledgeable Potter fan.A Monster Calls (2017)  86%Rating: PG-13, for thematic content and some scary images.Spanish director J.A. Bayona’s imaginative fantasy film is appropriate for viewers around 8 and older. Adults, however, will be a weepy mess regardless of age: A Monster Calls&nbsp;is daringly beautiful and achingly sad. Felicity Jones stars as the divorced mom of a lonely, 12-year-old son (Lewis MacDougall). She’s dying of cancer, and the boy channels his fear through his wild drawings of fantastical creatures. One night, the tree behind his house uproots itself and comes to life, with Liam Neeson richly providing the voice of this monster. The stories he tells the boy are wondrous, with an inspired mix of animation styles. And the tree itself is vividly detailed and tactile – but he’ll also be quite scary for very young viewers. He means well and he can be cheeky, but he’s also intimidating. The movie deals quite plainly with the prospect of a parent’s death, with the mom’s illness reaching such a severe state that she has to be hospitalized, forcing the boy to live with his stern grandmother (Sigourney Weaver). But it’s also is about forgiveness and growing up, as well as the healing power of creativity.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Starz, Television, Superheroes, razzies, Quiz, spider-man, unscripted, latino, die, finale, Box, YouTube, who","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/30171229/Ghost-in-the-Shell-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-ghost-in-the-shell-the-zookeepers-wife-and-the-boss-baby"},{"id":"47508907589485","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Inferno and Boo!

A Madea Halloween?by Christy Lemire | October 28, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s big new release is the latest in Dan Brown’s Da Vinci Code franchise, starring Tom Hanks, as well as Tyler Perry’s Halloween-themed outing as Madea from last week and another unique documentary from Werner Herzog. Christy Lemire lets us know how age-appropriate they are.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Inferno (2016)  23%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of action and violence, disturbing images, some language, thematic elements and brief sensuality.The third film based on Dan Brown’s best-selling novels about symbols and sinister secrets isn’t much better than its predecessors – The Da Vinci Code&nbsp;and Angels &amp; Demons&nbsp;– but it is more disturbing in its imagery. Ron Howard once again directs Tom Hanks as Harvard professor Robert Langdon, whose mission this time is to stop a high-tech plague from killing billions of people worldwide. Along the way, he finds himself plagued by hellish visions of bodies burning and writhing in pain and surging rivers of blood. Several characters also get shot or stabbed to death in their pursuit of Langdon and his latest sidekick, a brilliant young doctor (Felicity Jones). There’s also a bit of language and a brief love scene. Inferno is mostly silly, but it can be extremely scary and intense at times. This is one of those instances in which PG-13 really does mean that viewers under 13 shouldn’t see it.Tyler Perry's Boo! A Madea Halloween (2016)  19%Rating: PG-13, for drug use and references, suggestive content, language, some horror images and thematic material.I wanted to come back to this one since it didn’t screen for critics before opening day last week. Dedicated professional that I am, though, I spent actual money to attend a matinee showing. Tyler Perry’s latest Madea movie is very much in the same vein as the many others he’s starred in, written, and directed. Once again, the 6-foot-5 Perry dons a dress and wig to play his signature character, the thoroughly inappropriate Madea, as well as Madea’s nephew, Brian, and Brian’s father, Joe. This time, Madea and her randy, elderly pals try to break up a Halloween fraternity party that Brian’s 17-year-old daughter has attended without permission. Expect lots of language and jokes about pot smoking, stripping, getting arrested, and whooping children who don’t behave. And because it’s a Halloween movie, you’re also in for scary clowns, zombies, and the image of a young woman with her throat slashed. Once again, this really isn’t for anyone under 13.Into the Inferno (2016)  92%Rating: N/AThis is a Werner Herzog documentary about volcanoes, and it’s everything you’d want in a Werner Herzog documentary about volcanoes: dramatic imagery, thunderous sound design and remote locations. And as always, he narrates in that wonderfully thick German accent of his, delighting us with tales of the dangers we’re witnessing. Herzog and volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer travel around the globe, including stops in Iceland, Ethiopia, and North Korea, exploring the wonder and power of these fiery forces. But they also illuminate us on the cultural significance volcanoes have to these various peoples. Some of the scenes may seem startling but it’s always dazzlingly beautiful, and the film as a whole is a great educational experience, regardless of your age. Fine for all viewers – and a great way to chalk up your kid’s first Herzog film.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Nerve (2016)  66%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material involving dangerous and risky behavior, some sexual content, language, drug content, drinking and nudity – all involving teens.Your tweens and young teens will probably want to see this, and that might be OK with you – provided you explain to them that they should NOT try any of the movie’s crazy stunts at home. Emma Roberts and Dave Franco co-star in this action thriller about teens playing a dangerous online game of dare. They and many others across the country have signed onto an app called Nerve, in which you can either watch or take part in an increasingly risky series of challenges for money. The pranks are harmless at first – embarrassing stuff in public – but become more demanding and possibly deadly depending on what the watchers want the players to do. It doesn’t seem terribly implausible; given the summer of Pokemon Go&nbsp;we just experienced, walking around with your phone and interacting with strangers in wild ways actually makes sense. But the film grows tense and violent with stunts involving motorcycles, trains, fire, skyscrapers and guns. The lead characters end up in their underwear at a luxury department store and they kiss several times. One bad-girl cheerleader flashes her naked rear end during a football game. And there’s quite a bit of teen partying.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Marvel","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/28122933/Inferno-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-inferno-and-boo-a-madea-halloween"},{"id":"47508904962899","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and 3 Generations?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and 3 Generations?by Christy Lemire | May 5, 2017 |  CommentsThere’s one big movie out in theaters this week, and it’s likely to attract viewers of all ages, so before you take your littlest ones to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Christy offers an assessment of its PG-13 rating. Read on for her take, as well as her thoughts on transgender drama&nbsp;3 Generations and a couple of DVD releases.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)  85%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language and brief suggestive content.The follow-up to the 2014 surprise summer smash finds the Guardians getting caught up in another galactic adventure. And bickering – always bickering. Along the way to saving the day, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) – or Star-Lord, as he prefers to be called – learns the true identity of his long-lost father. Once again, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) are along for the ride, as well as the tiny Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). And similar to Diesel’s Fast and Furious&nbsp;franchise, the Guardians&nbsp;sequel is all about #family. There’s a ton of big, shiny, comic book-movie violence and action here: fights, chases, swordplay, and gunfire of the outer-space variety. There’s also a ton of language – mainly from the saucy Rocket. Star-Lord and Gamora enjoy some more romantic tension. And there’s some grown-up humor that’ll probably go over kids’ heads. I brought my son with me to a screening and he did fine – but he’s also seen a lot of Marvel movies in his 7½ years. The themes of loyalty, perseverance, and creating your own family are valuable. And kids will love the insanely adorable Baby Groot. I’d say this is suitable for viewers around 10 and older.3 Generations (2017)  32%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for or mature thematic content, some sexual references and language.Elle Fanning stars in this well-intentioned indie drama as Ray, a transgender teen living in New York City. He was born Ramona, but knew from a young age that he was a boy trapped in a girl’s body. Director and co-writer Gaby Dellal follows the conflict as Ray’s single mom (Naomi Watts) and lesbian grandmother (Susan Sarandon) struggle to accept his desire to transition fully through hormone therapy. It’s worthwhile subject matter for young people to learn more about, but quite a bit of the dialogue is mature and emotionally complicated. Several teenage characters discuss sex and body parts frankly in a bragging sort of way. We also see a couple of adult characters in bed after an afternoon tryst. And there’s quite a bit of language scattered throughout, including the one F-bomb allowed with a PG-13 rating. While the film itself skims the surface of a complex topic, it also has positive themes about communication and dedication. Fine for viewers ages 13 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;A Dog's Purpose (2017)  35%Rating: PG, for thematic elements and some peril.Have tissues nearby if you plan on watching this. There’s no way you won’t cry, several times, at the shamelessly heart-tugging sight of adorable dogs dying over and over again. Director Lasse Hallstrom’s film is supposed to be inspirational, though. It’s a hokey story about a dog named Bailey (voiced by a perky Josh Gad) whose spirit is repeatedly reincarnated over several decades. He finds himself inside a German shepherd police dog and a corgi who befriends a college student, among others. Yes, this is a concept that requires you to make giant leaps in faith. But the script is also full of melodramatic situations and barely-drawn characters. Younger viewers may not perceive all that, but they’ll probably find the sight of dogs in danger and dying rather disturbing. One version of Bailey gets shot and another is abandoned in the cold, dark night. There is eventual uplift, though, and the possibility of redemption. I brought my son with me to a screening and he didn’t find anything frightening. “I liked all of it,” he said. This movie is terrible, but it’s also terribly effective.Rings (2017)  8%Rating: PG-13, for violence/terror, thematic elements, some sexuality and brief drug material.Kids around 12 or 13 should be fine watching the latest in the Japanese-inspired Ring&nbsp;franchise, and this actually may not seem all that scary to them if they’ve seen the previous horror movies. It’s basically more of the same, only with updated technology — but depending on how your kids respond to scary movies, it may be too much for them. This sorta-sequel, sorta-reboot finds the infamous VHS tape resurfacing at a flea market. That’s where a college professor (Johnny Galecki) finds it; later, he makes the mistake of watching it. Of course, the trick is to find someone else to watch it to get rid of the deadly, seven-day curse. This drags in various unsuspecting innocents, including a freshman student (Alex Roe) and the loyal girlfriend he left back home (Matilda Lutz). The jumpy, grainy imagery remains vaguely creepy: the sight of the stringy-haired girl climbing out the well and the subsequent, paralyzing effect her presence has on her victims. Lutz’s character does some ill-advised exploring in the dark basement of an abandoned church, where she sees disturbing visions of what happened there years earlier. And Galecki’s character lights a joint before popping the tape in for the first time.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"TV, Guide, documentaries, MCU, CW, Amazon","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/05102821/Guardians-Galaxy-Vol2-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-and-3-generations"},{"id":"47508906101607","title":"How Family-Friendly is La La Land?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is La La Land?by Christy Lemire | December 9, 2016 |  CommentsAll of the wide releases this week are rated R, but at least one big movie with a lot of awards buzz — namely La La Land — is PG-13. Can you take your kids to this Oscar hopeful?&nbsp;Read on for details on Damien Chazelle’s latest, as well as a couple DVD releases.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;La La Land (2016)  91%Rating: PG-13, for some language.Writer-director Damien Chazelle’s singing and dancing extravaganza is a joyous and meticulously crafted homage to the classic, Technicolor musicals of the past. If your kids are into musicals, they will love this – but even if they insist they don’t like the genre (as my 7-year-old son does, although I don’t entirely believe him), they may still find themselves caught up in the colorful production numbers and infectious energy. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling star as a couple of struggling artists living in modern-day Los Angeles; she’s an aspiring actress, he’s a jazz musician. Chazelle follows them as they fall in love with each other and feel the highs and lows of chasing their dreams. At just over two hours, it may be a little on the long side for very young viewers. There’s a bit of drinking and partying. Stone and Gosling’s characters live together but the fact that they’re having sex is merely implied. And there’s some language including the one F-bomb you get with a PG-13 rating. But La La Land&nbsp;also has valuable themes about being true to yourself and staying dedicated to your goals. It’s also just a complete blast to watch, and it’s my pick for the best movie of 2016. I’d say it’s suitable for viewers around 7 or 8 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Secret Life of Pets (2016)  72%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for action and some rude humor.This high-energy, animated comedy from the folks who brought you the Despicable Me&nbsp;movies and Minions&nbsp;is fine for the whole family — for the most part. It’s based on something we’ve probably all wondered: What do our pets do all day while we’re away? It’s essentially the same idea behind Toy Story, but without the emotional complexity. Pets&nbsp;is about friendship and loyalty, and it’s more interested in lively, colorful antics. Max (voiced by Louis C.K.), a spry Jack Russell terrier enjoying a comfy life with his owner, Katie (Ellie Kemper), ends up with an unwelcome roommate when Katie brings home a big, shaggy stray from the pound named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Max and Duke become separated from their dog-walking group at the park and go on an adventure through the streets, alleys and sewers of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Along the way, mean dogcatchers pursue them (but they’re slapsticky and silly), forcing the dogs to join an underground group of wild animals led by a diabolical bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart). Max and Duke are frequently in danger and nearly drown at one point, and there are a few references to death of both the animal and human kind. There are the obligatory bits about butt-sniffing and nervous peeing. And a perky Pomeranian named Gidget (Jenny Slate) unleashes martial-arts fury on a bunch of creatures to protect her beloved Max, but it’s played for laughs.Jason Bourne (2016)  54%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, and brief strong language.Kids around 13 and older should be OK watching this latest installment in the Bourne&nbsp;franchise. It’s really too much to handle for anyone younger than that. It’s actually amazing this got a PG-13 rating. With its violence, rioting, brutal hand-to-hand combat, shootings and killings, it’s just right there on the edge of what you can show in a movie without earning an R. But if you’ve seen the three previous films in the series, you know what you’re in for; Jason Bourne covers much of the same ground. Matt Damon returns as the title character: a former assassin living underground and continuing to put together the pieces of his past and fill in the blanks in his memory. Along the way, he must take out the various shadowy dark-ops guys who are trying to kill him, as well as a highly trained sniper (Vincent Cassel) who has a personal grudge against him. One early sequence takes place during a protest in Athens that quickly escalates into chaos. Bourne also causes a ton of damage on his own through a couple of incredibly tense chases, one of which involves an armored SWAT truck plowing through traffic on the crowded Las Vegas strip. There’s also some profanity.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"all-time, One, Musical, Larson, Sneak, joker, Mystery","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/09121855/La-La-Land-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-la-la-land"},{"id":"47508906109803","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Arrival and Almost Christmas?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Arrival and Almost Christmas?by Christy Lemire | November 11, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy takes a look at a couple of PG-13 features — a cerebral sci-fi drama and a holiday-themed dysfunctional family comedy — to let us know how age-appropriate they are. Read on for details if you plan on taking the family to see either of them.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Arrival (2016)  94%Rating: PG-13, for brief strong language.Aliens have invaded earth. What do they want from us? That’s what Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner must determine in this subdued sci-fi drama from French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve. Adams plays a linguist trying to understand the aliens’ intricate language; Renner plays the biologist hoping to study their complex makeup. The images are beautiful and haunting at the same time, with a mix of mystery and wonder. Older kids with a taste for science fiction will find this compelling, but they might be a bit confused by the film’s time-hopping narrative structure. There’s a bit of language and a few intense situations. And part of the film’s drama comes from the death of a little girl who’d been suffering from a disease. But for the most part, Arrival&nbsp;defies your expectations of the panicky, heart-pounding alien thriller. It’s beautifully shot and ultimately, surprisingly, hopeful.Almost Christmas (2016)  49%Rating: PG-13, for suggestive material, drug content and language.Christmas is coming, which means it’s time for your annual wacky, dysfunctional-family comedy. Danny Glover, Mo’Nique, Gabrielle Union, Romany Malco, Kimberly Elise, and JB Smoove are among the large ensemble cast, playing members of a family gathering for their first Christmas after the death of their beloved matriarch. Long-held resentments explode and madcap hilarity ensues. Director David E. Talbert’s film is actually better written and acted than most films of this sentimental genre, though. There’s quite a bit of language – most of which comes from the hilariously brash Mo’Nique — and some grown-up situations involving infidelity and drug abuse. But ultimately, its themes of forgiveness and reconciliation are worthwhile. Fine for kids around 10 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"TCA, halloween, Kemper, OWN, Video","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/11112817/Arrival-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-arrival-and-almost-christmas"},{"id":"47508907599731","title":"How Family-Friendly are The Magnificent Seven and Storks?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are The Magnificent Seven and Storks?by Christy Lemire | September 23, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s animated film,&nbsp;Storks, is obviously aimed squarely at kids, but is there anything in the&nbsp;Magnificent Seven remake that might be too much for the young’uns? Christy breaks down this week’s new releases — and one DVD — to let us know what to watch out for.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Magnificent Seven (2016)  64%Rating: PG-13, for extended and intense sequences of Western violence, and for historical smoking, some language and suggestive material.This remake of the 1960 John Sturges Western The Magnificent Seven&nbsp;– itself a remake of the 1954 Akira Kurosawa classic Seven Samurai&nbsp;– once again focuses on a ragtag band of men who come together to protect a small town from invading bad guys. The setting this time is Northern California, and the main villain is a robber baron (Peter Sarsgaard) searching for gold. Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke and Byung-hun Lee play some of the tough guys and gunslingers who’ve signed on to stop him and his men. Director Antoine Fuqua’s film has a modern quality in its multicultural cast, but it mostly stays true to Western conventions. Expect prolonged scenes of intense violence, with shootouts, stabbings and battles on horseback. The carnage comes early and often, including an opening sequence in which Sarsgaard’s character coldly kills several townspeople to assert his dominance. There’s a bit of language and a ton of smoking. Fine for viewers around 13 and older – but I’d show them the original, first.Storks (2016)  65%Rating: PG, for mild action and some thematic elements.The idea behind this animated comedy is that storks don’t deliver babies anymore. Now, they deliver packages for an Amazon-like behemoth called Cornerstore.com. But when the baby-making section of the factory accidentally starts up again, it’s up to a stork named Junior (voiced by Andy Samberg) and a clumsy human named Tulip (Katie Crown) to deliver the infant before their blowhard of a boss (Kelsey Grammer) finds out she exists. Storks&nbsp;is zippy and zany but it also has a lot of unexpected heart. Much of that comes from the relationship between the lonely boy who wished for a little brother, which started this whole madcap sequence of events, and the parents (Ty Burrell and Jennifer Aniston) who are too busy with their real-estate business to spend time with him. Kids will love the colorful aesthetic and the fast-paced energy. There are also a couple of running bits that are truly absurd and insane, which they’ll probably find extremely entertaining. I didn’t see anything inappropriate when I brought my son, who’s almost 7, to a screening. But you may be in for an uncomfortable discussion on the way home about where babies come from. (It had to happen eventually, though, right?) Fine for the whole family.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016)  38%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi action violence.Kids around 10 and older probably will be fine watching this follow-up to the 2014, live-action installment in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;saga. You’ll be surprised to find it’s an improvement over that movie. The action sequences have some real verve (and actual coherence) to them, and the humor isn’t quite as cringe-inducing. This time, the four crime-fighting turtle brothers – Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo – must stop the dreaded Shredder and his Foot Clan from teaming up with an alien enemy who’s hell-bent on world domination. Or something. That means plenty of massive chase sequences, car crashes, exploding vehicles, ninja battles and general destruction. There’s also a bit of language and some slightly suggestive content involving Megan Fox in a naughty schoolgirl get-up. My son was about 6 ½ when he saw it; nothing freaked him out, and I found nothing objectionable in it for him. It’s just a matter of how comfortable you feel about your kids seeing this kind of big, noisy, CGI spectacle.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"foreign, boxoffice, joker","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/23122906/Magnificent-Seven-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-the-magnificent-seven-and-storks"},{"id":"47508907607927","title":"How Family-Friendly are Southside With You and The Hollars?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Southside With You and The Hollars?by Christy Lemire | August 26, 2016 |  CommentsThe biggest movies this week — Don’t Breathe and Mechanic: Resurrection — are both rated R, but there are still a couple of smaller films you could potentially take your kids to, including the story of Barack and Michelle Obama’s first date and a dysfunctional family comedy. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Southside With You (2016)  92%Rating: PG-13, for brief strong language, smoking, a violent image and a drug reference.This walking-and-talking romance recreates the first date between Barack and Michelle Obama, back when they were in their mid-20s with dreams of changing the world. Parker Sawyers plays the future president when he was still just a charismatic law student, with Tika Sumpter co-starring as the future first lady, his superior at the Chicago law firm where he worked during the summer of 1989. The two spend the day together on the city’s South side – hence the title – visiting an art exhibit, attending a community meeting, seeing a movie (Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing) and finally sharing a climactic ice cream cone. There’s a bit of language. The young Obama smokes cigarettes pretty much non-stop and jokes about smoking too much pot in college. We also see a snippet of the riot scene in Do the Right Thing&nbsp;as the couple is watching it in a theater. But this is a really lovely, intimate, beautifully acted film. I’d say it’s fine for viewers around age 10 and older, especially if they have an interest in history or politics.The Hollars (2016)  47%Rating: PG-13, for brief language and some thematic material.It’s an entire subgenre unto itself: the indie comedy-drama about a guy in his 30s who goes back to his small town to deal with his wacky, dysfunctional family and learn some important life lessons. The Hollars hits all the notes you expect so frequently, it almost feels like a parody of this kind of Sundance standard. But no, John Krasinski actually means it as both director and star. Krasinski plays an aspiring graphic artist named John Hollar who gets a call that his mother (Margo Martindale) is ailing. Once he returns home, he reconnects with his father (Richard Jenkins), whose business is going bankrupt, as well as his divorced, ne’er-do-well brother (Sharlto Copley). John also has a pregnant girlfriend (Anna Kendrick), who eventually shows up, too, as well as a former girlfriend (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who’s now married to his mother’s nurse (Charlie Day). Madcap antics abound. There’s some heavier stuff, too, involving the mother’s illness, her need for surgery and whether she can survive. There’s a bit of surreptitious, anxiety-induced smoking. And there’s some scattered language, including the one F-bomb you’re allowed with a PG-13 movie, which Copley gets the pleasure of screaming. This is OK for viewers around 10 or 11 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)  21%Rating: PG, for action and some rude humor.Kids around ages 6 or 7 and older will be OK watching this animated family comedy. It’s based on the sci-fi video game of the same name about the adventures of a cat-like creature named Ratchet, who’s a mechanic, and Clank, his robot friend. The two team up with a group of Galactic Rangers to stop the villainous Chairman Drek (voiced by Paul Giamatti) from blowing up various planets for his own nefarious purposes. John Goodman, Rosario Dawson, Sylvester Stallone, and Bella Thorne are also among the starry voice cast. This movie is pretty harmless but it’s also not very good. The jokes are flat, the antics are noisy and the overall tone is annoyingly cheeky. As for whether it’s appropriate for your kids, though, there’s a bit of action violence but it’s never scary. There is some weaponry and we see a few explosions, but it’s cartoonish in every sense of the word. I brought my son (who was 6 ½ at the time) to a screening of the movie and nothing bothered him.The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016)  19%Rating: PG-13, for fantasy action violence and some sensuality.Viewers around 9 or 10 and older should be fine with this sorta-prequel, sorta-sequel, sorta-spinoff to 2012’s Snow White and the Huntsman. Visually lush but narratively messy, it’s essentially a really angry version of Frozen, starring Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt as wicked royal sisters dueling for power. Blunt’s character, Freya, discovers she can shoot ice from her fingertips in a fit of rage and exiles herself to the snowy mountains where she builds her own kingdom and forms her own army. She rounds up and trains child soldiers for battle and explicitly instructs them not to fall in love. But two of them (Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain) — her two brightest, actually — grow up and do just that. (There are two brief love scenes — one in a hot tub, another in the forest — which suggest they have sex, but you don’t see anything.) Winter’s War&nbsp;also is about a quest to recover that famous mirror and, like the original film, features various strange forest creatures and digitally rendered dwarfs. Much of the combat is rather intense, and there’s a horned, roaring goblin who might seriously frighten younger kids. The special effects are quite dazzling but they also result in images that might be too scary, especially during the climactic showdown between the two sisters.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"docudrama, vampires, horror, cars, saw, e., rotten, guild, Mindy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/26114340/Southside-With-You-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-southside-with-you-and-the-hollars"},{"id":"47508907595633","title":"Voyage of Time is a Terrence Malick IMAX Experience Your Kids Will Enjoy","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Voyage of Time is a Terrence Malick IMAX Experience Your Kids Will Enjoyby Christy Lemire | October 7, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, the two biggest movies are both rated R, while the third wasn’t widely screened for critics. With that in mind, Christy takes the opportunity to tell us about an IMAX documentary from Terrence Malick that should serve as a nice introduction to his work for younger viewers. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Voyage of Time: The IMAX Experience (2016)  89%Rating:&nbsp;GIf you liked the cosmos section of The Tree of Life&nbsp;but wish it had been longer, this is the movie for you. Terrence Malick revisits the spectacular kind of imagery he created for that 2011 film (and reunites with its star, Brad Pitt, as narrator) for this IMAX exploration of the dawn of time. From the Big Bang to the dinosaurs to the asteroid that caused their demise, Voyage of Time recreates the planet’s earliest days. But it also bounces around through various eras and locations, from the oceans to the mountains to space. The images Malick and his team have created are jaw-droppingly gorgeous – bold, thrilling and wildly colorful – accompanied by vivid sound design that places you at the center of each new setting and a powerful soundtrack of classical music. Seeing it all on a massive IMAX screen truly makes this an immersive experience. There’s nothing here that’s even remotely frightening or inappropriate for kids; on the contrary, it’s an accessible entry to the world of science. Plus, you can finally chalk up your kid’s first Terrence Malick movie.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;X-Men: Apocalypse (2016)  47%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of violence, action and destruction, brief strong language and some suggestive images.Kids around 10 and older probably will be fine watching the latest X-Men&nbsp;extravaganza, especially if they’re already familiar with the franchise and its characters. We pick up after the events of 2014’s X-Men: Days of Future Past.&nbsp;This time, it’s the early 1980s. Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) is running his school for gifted children outside New York City and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is living a quiet life with his family in the woods of Poland. When an ancient, powerful mutant named Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) awakens with plans to decimate the globe, the X-Men (and women) must unite to stop him. There’s massive fighting and destruction, as you’d expect from any blockbuster based on comic book characters. There’s also a quiet, poignant scene in which a character’s family is slain. Apocalypse is a hulking, frightening figure who wreaks havoc, and the mystical process through which he gains his power might disturb some younger viewers. There’s also some profanity, including the one well-placed F-bomb you get with a PG-13 rating.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Fox, comedy, Fantasy, Schedule, shows, Book, fiction, book, drama, Classic, Video, biography, new, TV, Video","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/07124159/Voyage-of-Time-PG.jpg","slug":"voyage-of-time-is-a-terrence-malick-imax-experience-your-kids-will-enjoy"},{"id":"47508909036415","title":"How Family-Friendly are The BFG and The Legend of Tarzan?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are The BFG and The Legend of Tarzan?by Christy Lemire | July 1, 2016 |  CommentsSteven Spielberg’s adaptation of a Roald Dahl novel is pretty squarely aimed at kids, but Christy lets us know if there’s anything that might frighten the smallest moviegoers. Then she also gives us the lowdown on the latest interpretation of Tarzan, as well as a lively animated sequel on DVD. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The BFG (2016)  74%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for action/peril, some scary moments and brief rude humor.Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel is visually dazzling, with seamless special effects that blend computer-generated giants with real-life actors. Mark Rylance stars as the title character – the Big Friendly Giant – who teams up with a spirited, 10-year-old orphan named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill). Together, they try to stop other giants from eating people with the help of the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton) and the British military. Sophie is in near-constant danger of being smushed, stomped on or outright devoured by the hulking inhabitants of Giant Country. And while the BFG himself is gentle and kind, the other giants – who are much larger than he is – are grotesque and menacing, and might seem scary for the youngest viewers. Also, The BFG’s job is to capture dreams (and sometimes nightmares) to place in Londoners’ heads while they’re sleeping, so some of that imagery might be a bit creepy for little kids. And there’s a running gag involving flatulence that builds to an explosive climax. I brought my 6 1/2-year-old son with me to the screening, though, and he didn’t find anything frightening. I’d say this is suitable for pretty much all ages.The Legend of Tarzan (2016)  36%Rating: PG-13, for sequence of action and violence, some sensuality and brief rude dialogue.In this telling of the familiar legend, Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) – or, rather, John Clayton III, the fifth Earl of Greystoke – leaves genteel London to revisit the Belgian Congo of his youth with his wife, Jane (Margot Robbie). He’s going as a trade emissary and doesn’t realize he’s being lured into a trap. Along the way, the couple – along with an American diplomat who has tagged along (Samuel L. Jackson) – find themselves the targets of various jungle animals as well as well-armed human mercenaries, led by the greedy and devious right-hand man to the Belgian king (Christoph Waltz). This movie is extremely violent, between massive amounts of gunfire and brutal brawls between Tarzan and his former gorilla brethren. Much of the animal action is beautiful and even adorable, but a lot of it is intense and frightening, and it surely will startle younger viewers. Jane also is in peril much of the time – a damsel in need of rescuing, despite her smarts and pluck. There’s also a love scene – or at least the suggestion that Tarzan and Jane are about to have sex, followed by the two snuggling in bed, basking in the afterglow. Fine for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016)  87%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for martial arts action and some mild rude humor.The third film in the animated Kung Fu Panda&nbsp;franchise should be fine for all ages, even though there’s so much going on visually that it might seem overwhelming. Roly-poly panda Po (voiced by Jack Black) is back for more adventures, and this time the student becomes the teacher. Po must find his inner dragon master — and show other creatures how to find the untapped warriors within themselves. He teams up with his long-lost father (Bryan Cranston), the noodle-making goose who raised him (James Hong), and all their friends (Seth Rogen, David Cross, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu and Dustin Hoffman) to defeat an evil spirit warrior (J.K. Simmons) who’s stealing the chi of kung fu masters across China. It’s a gorgeous film filled with lively battles scenes as well as moments of genuine emotion. The combat scenes aren’t scary, though; they’re actually quite playful. After all, this is a movie in which a panda uses dumplings as weapons.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"blockbuster, Swim, Biopics, thriller, name, movie, Arrangement, Tumblr, halloween, Mary, shows, based, History, scorecard, Kimmy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/30153523/Legend-of-Tarzan-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-the-bfg-and-the-legend-of-tarzan"},{"id":"47508909043587","title":"How Family-Friendly is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows?by Christy Lemire | June 3, 2016 |  CommentsThe latest entry in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise hits theaters this weekend, aimed squarely at younger audiences, but with Michael Bay’s fingerprints all over it, how family-friendly is it, really?&nbsp;Read on for Christy’s thoughts on that, as well as a few new choices on DVD.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016)  38%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi action violence.The follow-up to the 2014, live-action incarnation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;is, shockingly, an improvement. The action sequences have some real verve (and actual coherence) to them, and the humor isn’t quite as cringe-inducing. This time, the four crime-fighting turtle brothers – Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo – must stop the dreaded Shredder and his Foot Clan from teaming up with an alien enemy who’s hell-bent on world domination. Or something. That means plenty of massive chase sequences, car crashes, exploding vehicles, ninja battles and general destruction. There’s also a bit of language and some slightly suggestive content involving Megan Fox in a naughty schoolgirl outfit. I brought my 6 ½-year-old son with me to see it — nothing freaked him out, and I found nothing objectionable in it for him. But if you feel uncomfortable with your kids seeing this kind of CGI spectacle, it’s probably best suited for viewers around 10 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Race (2016)  62%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and language.Tweens and older will probably be fine watching this earnest, well-intentioned biopic about prolific Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens. Stephan James stars as the legendary track and field athlete who was part of the controversial decision by the American team to compete in the Nazi-run 1936 Summer Games. Given the time period and the racially charged setting, you can expect lots of language and slurs, which may be uncomfortable for young viewers to hear — but it also may provide a teaching moment about history and racial struggles. (The title is a double entendre.) The film features Jews being forced onto transport vehicles and having their businesses vandalized. It also includes some sexual humor and shows Owens cheating on the mother of his child. But there are also many worthwhile themes here for kids to learn about and discuss, including perseverance, courage, and understanding.Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (2016)  46%Rating: PG-13, for zombie violence and action, and brief suggestive material.This time, the Bennet sisters aren’t just preoccupied with finding husbands — they’re fighting to stay alive. Because Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, like the genre-blending, best-selling novel it’s based on, is essentially Pride and Prejudice…&nbsp;with zombies. So that means this version of the Jane Austen classic is a whole lot more violent, filled with shootings, stabbings, beheadings, bloody faces, and smashed skulls as the undead stumble and mumble their way through 19th century England in search of brains. Many of the classic exchanges between Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) take place either while they’re battling each other or teaming up to fight off a zombie attack. But the effects in writer-director Burr Steers’ film are often so poorly staged, shot, and edited, it’s difficult to tell what’s happening. I’d steer your kids toward a different cinematic take on Pride and Prejudice&nbsp;– the 2005 version starring Keira Knightley, for example — but if they’re insistent on seeing this one, it’s probably OK for mature tweens and older.Gods Of Egypt (2016)  15%Rating: PG-13, for fantasy violence and action, and some sexuality.Not that I’d recommend seeing this with your family, but if you have to for whatever reason, it’s probably OK for mature tweens and older. Gods of Egypt is just a crazy, cheesy, over-the-top mish-mosh of history, mythology, and sci-fi fantasy. It’s basically about Egyptian gods (played by actors who are either Scottish, Australian, or Danish) turning into giant, metallic flying creatures that battle each other in the sky. There’s a ton of carnage and destruction, all of which is rendered in hilariously terrible special effects. One character gets his eyes plucked out of his face. Another takes a lengthy trip to the underworld, where some fellow travelers find themselves graphically obliterated if they don’t have anything valuable to secure their passage to eternal peace. There’s also a brief sex scene with partial nudity between Gerard Butler’s character, the power-hungry Set, and his mistress. This is super-violent and overlong but also just bad. Bad in a fun way quite often, but still — bad.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Channel, John, popular, Trek, technology, TV, Century, book, DC, TruTV, Cinematographers, and, asian-american, Britbox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/03114102/TMNT-Out-of-the-Shadows-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-out-of-the-shadows"},{"id":"47508909040513","title":"How Family-Friendly are Central Intelligence and Finding Dory?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Central Intelligence and Finding Dory?by Christy Lemire | June 17, 2016 |  CommentsA few scenes in Pixar’s latest may scare the youngest viewers, and the Dwayne Johnson/Kevin Hart action comedy might be a little on the racy side. Check Christy’s breakdown for more details, as well as her thoughts on a couple of new releases on home video.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Finding Dory (2016)  94%Rating: PG for mild thematic elements.The sequel to the essential 2003 Pixar film Finding Nemo&nbsp;finds the forgetful fish Dory (voiced once again by Ellen DeGeneres) swimming across the Pacific Ocean to seek the parents she recently remembered she had. Along the way, she gets help from various sea creatures including old friends Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (Hayden Rolence), a reluctant octopus (Ed O’Neill) and a nearsighted whale shark (Kaitlin Olsen). It’s funny and lively and visually wondrous, as we’ve come to expect from Pixar, with colors and details that are dazzlingly rich and vibrant. But there are ideas and moments here that might be scary for the littlest viewers, including flashbacks to Dory being separated from her parents when she was very young and feeling lost and alone within the massive ocean as she tries to reconnect with them. Parents, meanwhile, might get choked up at the prospect of being on the other side of that situation – and there’s one shot toward the end that’s just wrenching in its beauty. Dory and her friends are frequently in danger, but on the upside, they always find a way to help each other. And parents of children with disabilities or learning difficulties surely will find comfort in the film’s thoughtful treatment of Dory’s short-term memory loss. A great choice for the whole family.Central Intelligence (2016)  71%Rating: PG-13, for crude and suggestive humor, some nudity, action violence and brief strong language.Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart team up in this surprisingly funny mismatched-buddy comedy. Johnson stars as a former high school nerd who’s now a muscular man of mystery and action. Hart plays the classmate Johnson always looked up to: the one-time big man on campus who now realizes he peaked 20 years ago. There’s a ton of gun violence here as the two team up to keep government secrets from falling into the wrong hands. Johnson’s character also beats the daylights out of several people, all of whom are bad guys. (He’s also frequently naked, both in flashbacks to his portly former self and as the rock he is today.) And there’s quite a bit of language and racy humor. But Central Intelligence&nbsp;also has a strong anti-bullying message and an honest, warmhearted take on male friendship. Probably fine for kids around 13 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Eddie The Eagle (2016)  82%Rating: PG-13, for some suggestive material, partial nudity and smoking.Tweens and older will be fine watching this feel-good, formulaic story about the unlikely athletic prowess of Michael “Eddie” Edwards, who competed in the 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary as the first British ski jumper since the 1920s. What he lacked in natural physical ability he made up for in fearlessness and heart. It’s a pretty harmless story for the whole family for the most part, except for a couple of racy scenes. One features Eddie’s reluctant coach, a former American ski jumping great (Hugh Jackman), comparing the dynamics of takeoff to having sex with Bo Derek, complete with fake orgasm. The other scene takes place in a sauna where several hunky, Scandinavian ski jumpers are unwinding in little more than skimpy towels. Also, Jackman’s character smokes and sips from a flask pretty much non-stop. (It’s shorthand to indicate how rebellious he is.) But the movie also has some worthwhile messages about perseverance, self-confidence and drive. Back when it screened for critics, I brought my 6-year-old son with me and he enjoyed Eddie’s slapsticky antics. (He falls a lot, from various heights.)The Young Messiah (2016)  49%Rating: PG, for violence and some thematic elements.Regardless of your religious beliefs, this is probably OK for kids around nine or ten and older. It’s a novel take on Jesus Christ – based on an Anne Rice novel, actually – that envisions what life might have been like for the messiah as a 7-year-old boy who’s full of questions about his newfound healing abilities. It’s basically an origin story, the same as every superhero gets. Adam Greaves-Neal stars as young Jesus, who treks with his parents, Mary (Sara Lazzaro) and Joseph (Vincent Walsh), from Egypt back to their homeland in Israel upon hearing the news that the evil King Herod has died. What they don’t realize is that Herod’s son has taken over the throne and is on a quest to have this mysterious child killed. Along the way, Jesus learns to hone his powers and – spoiler! – ultimately accept his identity and responsibility as the Son of God. He also encounters some startling images, including the sight of Jews being crucified along the road and the killing of a man who had taken advantage of a servant girl. Plus, there’s the pesky Satan (Rory Keenan), whispering nasty suggestions in people’s ears and threatening Jesus at every turn.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"italian, Walt, Rock, FOX, TV, Hallmark, christmas, Tour, scary, Awards, Pictures","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/17122704/Central-Intelligence-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-central-intelligence-and-finding-dory"},{"id":"47508910501775","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are 10 Cloverfield Lane and The Peanuts Movie?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are 10 Cloverfield Lane and The Peanuts Movie?by Christy Lemire | March 11, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy looks at a new take on the life of Jesus Christ as a young seven-year-old child&nbsp;and at&nbsp;J.J.

Regardless of your religious beliefs, this is probably OK for kids around nine or ten and older.10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)  90%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material including frightening sequences of threat with some violence, and brief language.The sorta-sequel to the 2008 sci-fi hit Cloverfield, which followed a group of friends trying to survive an attack on New York City, is about a monster of a different kind. This time, a young woman (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) awakens from a terrible car accident to find that a man (John Goodman) has locked her in a cellar, insisting he’s saved her from an apocalyptic event that has left the outside world uninhabitable. The film features explosions, gunfire, shootings and death as well as some gruesome imagery (rotting pigs, a woman’s frightening face). There’s also some language,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;all-around tension until the true threat is revealed at the climax. This is probably fine for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Peanuts Movie (2015)  87%Rating: GThis sweet and simple return to the adventures of Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts&nbsp;gang is totally suitable for all ages and could be the ideal first movie for the youngest kids in your house. It was released theatrically in 3-D animation, but despite the high-tech approach, the film itself couldn’t be truer to comic strip creator Charles M. Schulz’s decades-old vision. This isn’t post-modern, snarky Peanuts. It’s essentially a series of familiar vignettes connected by a couple of intertwined through-lines: Charlie Brown tries to work up the nerve to talk to the mythological Little Red-Haired Girl while Snoopy, in his rich fantasy life as the World War I Flying Ace, tries to woo an attractive female pilot. He also battles his nemesis, the Red Baron, but it’s never really violent. The characters do exactly what you expect they’ll do, every single time; ideas, images, plot points, and even bits of dialogue have been lifted from previous Peanuts incarnations. It’s all very safe and reassuring as it taps into adults’ sense of nostalgia while reaching out to a new generation.In the Heart of the Sea (2015)  42%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of action and peril, brief, startling violence and thematic material.Mature tweens and older will probably be fine watching Ron Howard’s take on the true story that inspired the classic Moby Dick. It follows the monstrous whale that vexed a ship full of fishermen and coaxed them around the globe in the early 1820s. Chris Hemsworth stars as the hunky first mate, who tries to provide leadership and courage as the stranded crew’s situation grows bleaker in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The whale itself – a marvel of computer-generated imagery – probably will seem more awesome than fearsome to younger viewers. It truly is a spectacle to behold, and the main reason to see the film. But horrifying events transpire as the men grow more desperate at sea, including cannibalism and suicide. Also, their general appearance – emaciated, disheveled – might be disturbing for some.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"78th, Christmas, blockbusters, Pet, theme, Hallmark, Best, Cartoon, toronto, Pop, Awards, cops, Games, 2018, crime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/11193148/sean-bean-young-messiah3-e1457726514633.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-10-cloverfield-lan-and-the-peanuts-movie"},{"id":"47508910517143","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Ride Along 2 and Norm of the North?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Ride Along 2 and Norm of the North?by Christy Lemire | January 15, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy offers details on an Ice Cube-Kevin Hart buddy-cop comedy sequel and a poorly received animated film from a fledgling studio, plus a couple of choices on DVD. Read on for the list.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Ride Along 2 (2016)  14%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of violence, sexual content, language and some drug material.Ride Along&nbsp;was a surprise hit in 2014. So: surprise! Now we have a sequel, which is essentially the same movie all over again. Kevin Hart and Ice Cube reprise their mismatched buddy-cop roles — Hart chatters, Cube glowers — only this time, Hart’s character actually is a probationary police officer, and not just a wannabe. Still, he manages to mess things up with his unstoppable enthusiasm and half-baked notions of detective work. He follows his soon-to-be brother-in-law from Atlanta to Miami to stop a villainous shipping magnate (Benjamin Bratt) from doing something villainous. Shootouts, explosions and copious amounts of South Beach booty shaking inevitably occur. There’s also some language and sexually suggestive material. If you must see this, it’s probably OK for mature tweens to watch, too.Norm of the North (2016)  7%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for mild rude humor and action.I actually didn’t see this film. The only screening of it took place at the exact same time as the only screening of 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. The folks behind this animated family movie knew of the scheduling conflict and made no other options available. Clearly, they weren’t terribly interested in having critics see it, and the few who did see it have few kind words: It’s hovering above the ground in the single digits on the Tomatometer. Anyway, it’s about a chatty, wacky polar bear (voiced by Rob Schneider) who travels to New York City to stop a real estate developer from building luxury condos near his Arctic home. Along for the ride is a trio of adorable, Minion-esque lemmings. Madcap fish-out-of-water antics and fart jokes ensue. This is probably fine (and best-suited, really) for the young kids in your house. But based on the trailers alone, it looks like you’ll be miserable.&nbsp;NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015)  55%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for some scary images, action and rude humor.The sequel to the 2012 animated hit Hotel Transylvania&nbsp;is fine for viewers of all ages (and I actually liked it better than the original). This time, Dracula (voiced once again by Adam Sandler) tries to coax out the latent vampire tendencies in his sweet, 4-year-old grandson, Dennis, the only child of his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez), and her human husband, Jonathan (Andy Samberg). He also has a hotel to run with the help of his monster friends (Steve Buscemi, Kevin James, Keegan-Michael Key, David Spade). It’s got the same snappy pacing, silly sight gags and clever pop culture references as the first film, but it also features more characters and more adventures. The monsters are so cute and goofy, though, they won’t be the slightest bit frightening to your children. But: There’s a vampire character who enters toward the end — the right-hand man of Drac’s dad, Vlad (Mel Brooks) — who is scarier than the rest and puts some of the little-kid characters in danger. That’s the only part of the movie that bothered my son, who wasn’t quite 6 when he saw it.The Martian (2015)  91%Rating: PG-13, for some strong language, injury images and brief nudity.One of the biggest box-office smashes of last year is now out on DVD. Hopefully, you saw it in the theater — on the biggest screen you could find — because Ridley Scott’s space odyssey is just dazzling. If not, hopefully you’ve got a giant TV at home on which to enjoy the spectacular visuals. Matt Damon just earned a best-actor Oscar nomination this week for playing an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars when his fellow crewmembers presume he’s dead after a powerful storm. But because he’s also a botanist, he’s equipped with the know-how to make the most of his long, lonely stay. His time on Mars is fraught with peril (and some truly gnarly bloody moments). He also only has himself to talk to, which understandably includes some language. But Scott’s film is thrilling — beautifully made, suspenseful and surprisingly funny. And it features some inspired work from a strong supporting cast, including Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain and Donald Glover. If you’ve got older kids and tweens in your house with a taste for adventure and an interest in science, this is an excellent choice.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"24, in, nightmare, politics, toronto, Video, TV, Song, name, Spike","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/15114827/NormOfNorthPG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-ride-along-2-and-norm-of-the-north"},{"id":"47508911580063","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Spectre, The Peanuts Movie, and Brooklyn?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Spectre, The Peanuts Movie, and Brooklyn?by Christy Lemire | November 5, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy breaks down the latest entry in the James Bond franchise, a return to an animated classic, and a well-received indie drama. Also, on DVD, she takes another look at an excellent Pixar film and Chris Evans’ directorial debut. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Spectre (2015)  63%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of action and violence, some disturbing images, sensuality and language.The 24th&nbsp;James Bond film (and the fourth starring Daniel Craig) features all the international intrigue and villainy you’ve come to expect. Car chases, explosions, shootings (including a suicide), mid-air helicopter brawls and a truly punishing fistfight aboard a train – it’s all here, and more. One guy gets his eyes gouged out before having his neck snapped. The plot this time, in case you’re curious: Bond must uncover who’s behind a shadowy organization known as Spectre, a syndicate of bad guys hell-bent on world domination. There’s also an intertwined plot involving the possibility of dismantling the double-0 program in favor of more high-tech surveillance tactics. It’s extremely violent, of course. And Bond gets to bed a couple of gorgeous women, of course. But it’s probably OK for mature tweens and older, especially if they’ve ever seen any of the previous Bond pictures.The Peanuts Movie (2015)  87%Rating:&nbsp;G.Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts gang are back, this time in 3-D animation. But despite the high-tech approach, the film itself couldn’t be sweeter or truer to the simplicity of creator Charles M. Schulz’s decades-old vision. This isn’t post-modern, snarky Peanuts. The movie is essentially a series of familiar vignettes connected by a couple of intertwined through-lines: Charlie Brown tries to work up the nerve to talk to the mythological Little Red-Haired Girl while Snoopy, in his rich fantasy life as the World War I Flying Ace, tries to woo a comely female pilot. He also battles his nemesis, the Red Baron, but it’s never really violent. The characters do exactly what you expect they’ll do, every single time; ideas, images, plot points and even bits of dialogue have been lifted from previous Peanuts&nbsp;incarnations. It’s all very safe and reassuring as it taps into adults’ sense of nostalgia while reaching out to a new generation. Totally suitable for all ages, and the ideal first movie for the youngest kids in your family.Brooklyn (2015)  97%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for a scene of sexuality and brief strong language.A truly beautiful – and beautifully acted – film about a young, Irish immigrant coming into her own in Brooklyn in the early 1950s. Saoirse Ronan is absolutely radiant as the determined Eilis, who starts out shy and homesick but evolves into a young woman of great poise and confidence as she finds her place in a new land. Eilis and her longtime boyfriend (a charismatic Emory Cohen) kiss quite a bit, and there’s the implication that they have sex. There’s also a bit of language. But this is a great film for tweens to see, especially the girls in your house. It’s all about figuring out who you are and being true to yourself under difficult and emotionally charged circumstances.&nbsp;NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Inside Out (2015)  98%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for mild thematic elements and some action.Pixar Animation’s summer smash hit is beautiful and heartbreaking, lively and profound. And, like the absolute best Pixar movies, it will move every member of your family on a different level. An 11-year-old girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) reluctantly moves with her parents from Minneapolis to San Francisco. We see the toll this massive shift takes on her through the various character traits interacting in her head: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). It’s energetic and colorful and very, very funny, often in physical and slapsticky ways. (My then-5-year-old son’s favorite part was when the hotheaded Anger set Fear’s butt on fire.) Kids of all ages will be completely enthralled and entertained. But Inside Out works even better for the adults in the audience for the thoughtful, complex ways it addresses the nature of our memories and the crucial role they play in shaping our personalities and building lifelong bonds. Director and co-writer Pete Docter’s film is smart and ambitious and a must-see. And oh yes, it will make you cry at least a couple of times. It places some of its characters in brief peril, but otherwise it’s totally suitable for all ages.Before We Go (2015)  27%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for brief strong language and some suggestive content.Chris Evans strays far from the blockbuster Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Captain America character that made him a superstar to direct and co-star in this intimate, indie romance. Evans and Alice Eve play strangers who meet in the middle of the night at Grand Central Terminal and end up walking and talking until dawn throughout New York City. Along the way, they discuss their respective love lives, career choices, dreams and regrets. There’s some mature talk here about marriage and infidelity and some language. Evans’ character also gets punched in the face when he tries to retrieve Eve’s stolen Prada bag. Overall, though, it’s pretty harmless but also pretty dull. Fine for tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"awards, Calendar, Photos, and, scene, animated, Bros., Oscars, green, FXX, TV, Black","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/05162752/PeanutsSpectreBrooklyn.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-spectre-the-peanuts-movie-and-brooklyn"},{"id":"47509041586221","title":"Video: Getting the Scoop on Digging for Fire","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Getting the Scoop on Digging for Fireby Grae Drake | August 21, 2015 |  CommentsJake Johnson and Rosemarie DeWitt from Digging for Fire tell&nbsp;us about the true story buried inside the film, and everyone reveals their own backyard finds.","section":"Video Interviews","tags":"target, adaptation, italian, 99%, Stephen, halloween, Series, on, Superheroes, Anna, high, movies, know, Musicals, binge","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Digging-for-Fire-600x262-With-Play-Button.jpg","slug":"video-getting-the-scoop-on-digging-for-fire"},{"id":"47508911592356","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Martian, The Walk, and He Named Me Malala?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Martian, The Walk, and He Named Me Malala?by Christy Lemire | October 2, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy talks about three very different new movies out in theaters. The first is Ridley Scott’s latest space adventure, the story of a stranded astronaut starring Matt Damon; the second is Robert Zemeckis’ retelling of an amazing real life stunt; and the third is a stirring documentary about a teenaged female activist in Pakistan who was targeted by the Taliban. All three are Fresh, but are they okay for kids to watch? Read on to see what Christy says.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Martian (2015)  91%Rating: PG-13, for some strong language, injury images and brief nudity.Matt Damon stars as an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars when his fellow crew members presume he’s dead after a powerful storm. But because he’s also a botanist, he’s equipped with the know-how to make the most of his long, lonely stay. His time on Mars is fraught with peril (and some truly gnarly bloody moments). He also only has himself to talk to, which understandably includes some language. But Ridley Scott’s film is thrilling – beautifully made, suspenseful and surprisingly funny. And it features some inspired work from a great strong cast, including Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain and Donald Glover. If you’ve got older kids and tweens in your house with a taste for adventure and an interest in science, this is an excellent choice this weekend. See it on the biggest screen you can find.The Walk (2015)  83%Rating: PG, for thematic elements involving perilous situations, and for some nudity, language, brief drug references and smoking.This is a feature-film version of the story of French daredevil Philippe Petit, who famously walked a wire between the World Trade Center towers in 1974. (His wild tale previously came to the screen with the Oscar-winning 2008 documentary Man on Wire.) Director Robert Zemeckis uses his affinity for high-tech filmmaking (Forrest Gump, The Polar Express) to make the walk itself as breathtakingly immersive as possible. As Petit, Joseph Gordon-Levitt also stands atop the Statue of Liberty to provide narration. If you have trouble with heights or suffer from vertigo, this might be a truly excruciating experience for you. But otherwise, it’s actually quite suitable for the whole family. It’s rated PG, and includes a bit of language here and there and a tiny bit of pot smoking. I brought my son, who’s almost 6, to a screening and nothing here was scary for him (although he did fall asleep about halfway through, and I had to wake him up for the actual walk.) Like The Martian, you should see this on the biggest screen you can find – preferably, in IMAX 3-D.He Named Me Malala (2015)  72%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements involving disturbing images and threats.This is a documentary about Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager who was shot in the head by the Taliban for advocating girls’ education and went on the become the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. It’s an inspiring story, to be sure, one’s that’s extremely worthwhile for young people to learn – especially young women, on whose behalf she’s worked tirelessly worldwide. But Davis Guggenheim’s film is frustratingly superficial in terms of how she truly feels about being attacked at age 15 and how she feels now about becoming an international symbol of hope. Guggenheim does include photos of the bloody crime scene, though: the school bus on which Yousafzai was riding home alongside two of her girlfriends. We also see the aftermath of attacks on schools and we hear broadcasts of the Taliban’s rhetoric. But overall, this is suitable for tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Fox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MartianWalkMalala.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-the-martian-the-walk-and-he-named-me-malala"},{"id":"47508911568795","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is The Lady in the Van?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is The Lady in the Van?by Christy Lemire | December 4, 2015 |  CommentsWith almost everything new this week falling on the more adult end of the spectrum, Christy focuses on the one theatrical feature rated PG-13 that might be a decent watch for younger viewers. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Lady In The Van (2015)  89%Rating: PG-13, for a brief unsettling image.Maggie Smith is adorably cantankerous in this true story of a homeless woman who parked her van in the driveway of a playwright’s London home and didn’t leave for 15 years. The Lady in the Van&nbsp;is based on Alan Bennett’s play of the same name, inspired by his real-life experience with a woman who requested to be addressed exclusively as Miss Shepherd. Nicholas Hytner’s film has plenty of hard-earned lessons about tolerance, generosity, and kindness. It features several characters who are repulsed by the sight and smell of Miss Shepherd but eventually find a soft spot in their hearts for her. But it also includes — spoiler alert — the discovery of her dead body inside the van toward the end; it’s a quiet, peaceful image, but it’s apparently the reason for the film’s PG-13 rating. The movie has a nice message, though, and should be fine for older kids and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"cartoon, Day, Guide, directors, indiana, Tumblr, DC, spanish, Film, period, movies, Avengers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04154605/LadyintheVantPG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-is-the-lady-in-the-van"},{"id":"47508911583136","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are DVD Releases Pixels and Max?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are DVD Releases Pixels and Max?by Christy Lemire | October 30, 2015 |  CommentsAll the big new releases in theaters this week are rated R, so Christy takes a look at a couple of home video options instead. Selections include the recent Adam Sandler movie about a video game invasion and an ostensibly family-centric movie about a military dog with PTSD. Read on for details.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Pixels (2015)  17%Rating: PG-13, for some language and suggestive comments.Aliens attack the Earth in the form of classic ’80s video games — &nbsp;Pac-Man, Centipede, Donkey Kong&nbsp;— in this alleged comedy starring Adam Sandler. As a former gaming prodigy, Sandler’s character must save the planet alongside old friends and foes (Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage). Michelle Monaghan co-stars as a brilliant lieutenant colonel who devises the technology to defeat these pixelated villains, but she’s also stuck playing a weak and weepy woman — the worst kind of clichéd stereotype. (Later, a female video game warrior literally becomes a trophy for Gad’s character.) Such thematic dilemmas aside, for the most part, this is an appropriate movie for your kids to see. Actually, it’s much more for children than it is for adults, despite its lazy attempts to evoke ’80s nostalgia. There’s some language. The alien attack is quite literally cartoonish and never really scary, but several people do disintegrate as they get sucked up into a spaceship. (That’s the only part that freaked out my son, who was 5 ½ at the time.) And at one point, Qbert pees.Max (2015)  37%Rating: PG, for action violence, peril, brief language and some thematic elements.Don’t let the sweet, furry face in the posters fool you: This is a surprisingly violent PG-rated movie. The film from director and co-writer Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans) follows the journey of Max, a Marine search dog who returns from Afghanistan suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. It has some heartwarming scenes as the Belgian Malinois bonds with Justin (Josh Wiggins), the younger brother of his former handler (Robbie Amell), who died in the line of duty. But it also has plenty of heavy-handed hanky moments, early and often. And then it gets super violent as Justin, his friends and Max try to expose a weapons-smuggling ring in their small Texas town. The bad guys kidnap Justin’s dad (Thomas Haden Church) and a crazy amount of gunfire ensues. They also chase after Justin and his friends, repeatedly putting them in peril. Meanwhile, their guard dogs — a couple of snarling, drooling Rottweilers — engage in some frightening fights with Max. My dog-loving son, who was 5 ½ at the time, turned to me at one point and said: “This movie is too violent.” And in retrospect, he was too young to see it. But it’s probably OK for kids around 9 or 10 and older.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Trek, movies, Month, TV, TV, Universe, latino, dceu, movies, Classic, language, Spectrum, thriller, Arts","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/30111423/PixelsMax.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-dvd-releases-pixels-and-max"},{"id":"47508913401775","title":"Parental Guidance: Ant-Man, Mr. Holmes, and The Longest Ride","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Ant-Man, Mr. Holmes, and The Longest Rideby Christy Lemire | July 17, 2015 |  CommentsNEW IN THEATERSAnt-Man 83%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi action violence.The latest Marvel Comics superhero extravaganza is actually a rather modest affair. That’s because Paul Rudd’s character becomes a tiny crime fighter — ant-sized, to be exact. Rudd’s Scott Lang was a criminal himself, but now is teaming up with the professor (Michael Douglas) who created this shrinking particle (and a snazzy suit to go with it) to protect the technology from falling into the wrong hands. It’s a much lighter and breezier movie than most we’ve seen recently from the Marvel Cinematic Universe — the fate of the world is not at stake, for example — but there are still several thrilling and intense moments, and a few scary ones. Ant-Man must battle a bad guy who also has the capacity to diminish in size. A few people and animals who become the unwitting subjects of the shrinking experiments wind up being zapped into blobs of goo. And a little girl finds herself in very real and intimate peril. There’s also some language, some physical fighting and a tiny bit of brief kissing. Fine for tweens and up.Mr. Holmes 88%Rating: PG, for thematic elements, some disturbing images and incidental smoking.This is a different take on the legacy of Sherlock Holmes, focusing on his later years in his remote farmhouse by the sea. Director Bill Condon’s film finds the world-famous detective (Ian McKellen), at age 93, struggling to recall the details of the case that ended up being his last. He has just returned from post-World War II Japan with a plant whose healing powers he hopes will restore his mental acuity, but he continues to deteriorate. Also living in the house are Holmes’ housekeeper (Laura Linney) and her young son (Milo Parker). Holmes reflects upon this final investigation, which involved the makings of a murder plot. While in Japan, he visited the remnants of Hiroshima and witnessed the devastating impact the bomb had on the city’s survivors. And the boy, whose inquisitive nature makes him a keen companion for Holmes, finds himself in serious physical danger when he helps tend to the detective’s prized bees. There’s also just the scary nature of the creeping effects of dementia. It’s rated PG, though, so for the most part it’s fine for kids around age 8 and older.NEW ON DVDThe Longest Ride 31%Rating: PG-13, for some sexuality, partial nudity, and some war and sports action.Hunky Scott Eastwood — son of Clint, who eerily resembles his father in his young Rawhide days — stars as a professional bull rider living in North Carolina. This being a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, though, he also falls in love — with an art history major (Britt Robertson) who’s on her way to New York City for a gallery internship after graduation. Tweens and older are probably the suitable age for the romantic elements of this fantasy about beautiful but extremely different people whose love is probably doomed. They enjoy a little partial nudity before their artfully lighted, tastefully photographed shower sex. Eastwood’s character also suffers serious injuries from some ornery bulls, which are difficult to watch. A parallel plot involving flashbacks to a young couple during World War II features some violence during the battle scenes and some serious conversations about infertility. In the present day, there’s also some language and collegiate drunkenness.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"witnail, President, cartoon, Geographic, Academy, Masterpiece, archives","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ant-Man-PG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-antman-mr-holmes-and-the-longest-ride"},{"id":"47508913397677","title":"Parental Guidance: Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation and Home","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation and Homeby Christy Lemire and Matt Atchity | July 30, 2015 |  CommentsIn Theaters This WeekMission: Impossible Rogue Nation (2015)  94%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of action and violence, and brief partial nudity.Tom Cruise returns for a fifth Mission: Impossible movie, which turns out to be one of the best entries in the series; for that matter, it’s also one of the best action movies of the summer.&nbsp;In this latest adventure, super-spy Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is on the trail of a shadowy organization called the Syndicate.&nbsp; Unfortunately, no one else really believes that the Syndicate actually exists, so Hunt is disavowed by the US government, and the IMF is shut down.&nbsp; Hunt isn’t one to take this lying down; he gets his team back together to help him take down the Syndicate, and naturally that means a lot of over-the-top action sequences.&nbsp;Older kids will probably like that the movie speeds along, with hardly a pause between the chases and fights.&nbsp;But the story gets complicated, and can be a bit hard to follow (although everything moves so fast, it doesn’t really matter).&nbsp;As expected, you’ll see a fair amount of gunfights here, with nameless henchmen serving as cannon fodder, and early on there is a murder that’s pretty intense without being very gruesome.&nbsp; The “brief partial nudity” mentioned in the ratings comes from a scene where co-star Rebecca Ferguson is briefly topless, but the camera only catches her from behind.&nbsp;And this being a Tom Cruise movie, you get the required helmet-free motorcycle chase.&nbsp;It should be fine for older kids and more mature pre-teens.New on DVDHome (2015)  52%Rating: PG, for mild thematic elements.This colorful and lively but derivative animated comedy follows the unlikely friendship that forms between an alien and a lonely girl. Jim Parsons provides the voice of a well-meaning but socially awkward creature named Oh, who’s part of a species of space beings called the Boov who take over Earth. But when Oh makes a giant mistake which makes him a fugitive, he hooks up with a seventh grader named Tip (voiced by Rihanna); she’s looking for her mother (Jennifer Lopez), who got sucked up into a spaceship and relocated when the Boov invaded. The idea of being alone and separated from a parent might be disturbing to some kids. And the bad-guy aliens who are after the Boov might seem frightening, although they’re menacing in a rather cartoonish way. There’s also the general threat that the world might blow up at any minute, but alongside that big idea are lots of goofy fart and pee jokes. This is a totally suitable diversion for kids of nearly all ages.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Pride, streaming, Esquire, crime, ghosts, story, FOX, watch","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MissionImpossibleRogueGuida.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-mission-impossible-rogue-nation-and-home"},{"id":"47508913405874","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is Max?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is Max?by Christy Lemire | June 26, 2015 |  CommentsNEW IN THEATERSMax 37%Rating: PG, for action violence, peril, brief language and some thematic elements.Don’t let the sweet, furry face in the posters fool you.

And, like the absolute best Pixar movies, it will speak to and move every member of your family on a different level. An 11-year-old girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) reluctantly moves with her parents from Minneapolis to San Francisco. We see the toll this massive shift takes on her through the various character traits interacting in her head: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Louis Black), Fear (Bill Hader) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling).

They performed on so many important, enduring hits of the 1960s and early ’70s, it’s staggering, from the Mamas and the Papas’ “California Dreamin’” to Nancy Sinatra’s “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’” (and her dad’s “Strangers in the Night”) to the entire, groundbreaking Beach Boys album Pet Sounds. Director Denny Tedesco’s documentary is loving but a little repetitive. It’s got some language and some archival photographs of the musicians smoking in the studio. But if your kids are into music, they could definitely learn something about dedication and craft from this film.

As a former gaming prodigy, Sandler’s character must save the planet, alongside old friends and foes (Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage). Michelle Monaghan co-stars as a brilliant lieutenant colonel who devises the technology to defeat these pixelated villains, but she’s also relegated to playing a weak and weepy woman — the worst kind of clichéd stereotype.

The next morning, she mysteriously has disappeared, inspiring him and his two best friends to go on a hunt to find her. Paper Towns is based on the novel by John Green (The Fault in Our Stars), so the young-adult crowd probably knows what’s in store. There’s some teen-movie partying, including beer bongs, keg stands and subsequent vomiting. A couple of characters engage in a hot-and-heavy make-out session, and a couple of others ponder the prospect of losing their virginity to each other on prom night. And there’s a bit of language. But this is totally fine for tweens and older. It’s a movie that I really liked — but I would have loved it if I’d seen it at age 13.New on DVDPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 (2015)  5%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for some violence.This movie is terrible. I mean, it’s harmless in terms of its content. There isn’t really anything offensive or racy or objectionable. It’s just painfully unfunny. But if this is the only family-friendly movie available to rent… well, you’ll still be annoyed that you wasted your time and money. Kevin James reprises his title role from the slapsticky and inexplicably successful Paul Blart: Mall Cop from six years ago. This time, his portly and bumbling character travels to Las Vegas for a security guard convention. There, he accidentally thwarts a massive art heist with the help of his college-bound daughter (Raini Rodriguez). She briefly finds herself in peril when she first discovers the scheme, and some of the bad guys carry guns. (Most of the fighting takes place with non-lethal weaponry, however.) But before they ever leave town, Paul’s mother is run over and killed by a milk truck in abrupt fashion at the film’s start. Like the other James movie out this week, Pixels, it’s just hilarious.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"71st, movies, curtis, romantic, Nat, Max, Christmas","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PixelsPG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-pixels-paper-towns-and-paul-blart"},{"id":"47508914524090","title":"Parental Guidance: The Age of Adaline, Little Boy, and More","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Age of Adaline, Little Boy, and Moreby Christy Lemire | April 24, 2015 |  CommentsThe Age of Adaline 54%Rating: PG-13, for some thematic material, including violence.Blake Lively stars in this romantic fantasy as a beautiful woman who stopped aging at 29 after a cosmic car accident. Decades later, she’s been moving around and changing her identity to avoid being discovered — and she’s been reluctant to let anyone get close to her. This handsomely crafted film features a couple of major car crashes, actually. It suggests that Adaline has sex with the handsome philanthropist (Michiel Huisman) she allows herself to fall for, but we don?t actually see anything. There’s also a dog death, which might choke you up. (It got to me). And it features some very mature notions about love and immortality. Still, this is probably suitable for tweens and older — especially those with an interest in history or fashion. The statuesque Lively gets to wear some gorgeous period clothes.Little Boy 24%Rating: PG-13, for some thematic material, including violence.Don’t let the title fool you. This is a rather intense and violent film that may be too disturbing for your own little boy or girl. Jakob Salvati stars as a diminutive 8-year-old named Pepper, who’s mercilessly teased by bullies in 1940s small-town California. When his father and only friend (Michael Rapaport) goes off to fight in World War II, Pepper performs a series of charitable acts in hopes of bringing him back at the suggestion of the town priest (Tom Wilkinson). This is a faith-based movie that features war footage, a hate crime and racial epithets against a Japanese man, shootings, a major death and a funeral. It’s also kinda terrible. Avoid it if you can.NEW ON DVDTaken 3 12%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, and for brief strong language.If you have seen the previous two Taken films, you pretty much know what you’re in for here: muscular, brutal and implausible PG-13 violence. Once again, Liam Neeson shows off his particular set of skills in the third (and supposedly last) installment in the series. This time, Neeson’s former covert operative is framed for the killing of his ex-wife (Famke Janssen). He must outsmart Los Angeles police, Russian gangsters and various government agencies to prove he’s innocent and protect his daughter (Maggie Grace) from becoming the next victim. Messily edited fistfights, shootouts, chases and crashes ensue. If you love Neeson and insist on seeing everything he’s in — or if you’re dying to know what happens next in the Taken series — I guess you’ll want to catch this. But you’ll probably be just fine if you don’t.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"First, docuseries, female, sports, Out, new, Kaling, Musical, Comic, Watching, Heroines, Fox, films, indie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/little-boy.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-the-age-of-adaline-little-boy-and-more"},{"id":"47508914560961","title":"Parental Guidance: The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Second Best Exotic Marigold HotelWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | March 6, 2015 |  CommentsThe Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 65%Rating: PG, for some language and suggestive content.It’s hard to imagine why any young people would want to see this movie, a sequel to the 2012 hit about British retirees living in a run-down Indian resort. But let’s say, theoretically, that you and your family have been snowed in for days, you’re desperate to escape the house and this is the only movie you can all see together. It’s fine. It’s not good, but it’s fine. Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy are among the acting greats returning for round two, which includes all kinds of wacky misunderstandings and mistaken identities. There is the suggestion that certain elderly characters are having sex with each other as well as the suggestion that other elderly characters are enjoying dalliances on the side. And the prospect of death looms large at all times — albeit for comic effect — including daily roll calls to ensure that all of the Marigold Hotel’s residents have made it through the night. All in all, though, this is pretty harmless for all ages.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"die, japanese, Paramount, Poppins, show","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/marigold-hotel.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-the-second-best-exotic-marigold-hotel"},{"id":"47508914514872","title":"Parental Guidance: Hot Pursuit and Selma","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Hot Pursuit and Selmaby Christy Lemire | May 8, 2015 |  CommentsHot Pursuit 7%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content, violence, language and some drug material.Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara star in this screechy, mismatched-buddy road-trip comedy. Witherspoon plays a fast-talking, by-the-book police officer who’s eager to prove herself after an embarrassing Taser mishap. (Police brutality may not be the best source of laughs these days.) Vergara plays the sassy, blingy wife of a high-ranking drug cartel member whom Witherspoon’s character must escort to Dallas to testify before entering witness protection. When they’re confused for dangerous criminals, madcap hilarity (and misogynistic humor) ensue. There’s a bit involving a car crash which sends a cloud of cocaine floating into the sky — and into Witherspoon’s system, which makes her even more manic. Lots of gunshots are fired — some resulting in death — but since this is a PG-13 movie, we don’t see much carnage. There’s some language. And at one point, Vergara and Witherspoon pretend to be lesbian lovers, making out with each other to distract a suspicious farmer. This movie is probably suitable for tweens and older, but it’s terrible for everybody regardless of age.NEW ON DVDSelma 99%Rating: PG-13, for disturbing thematic material including violence, a suggestive moment, and brief strong language.Director Ava DuVernay’s Oscar-winning film, which follows Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as he led the fight for equal voting rights in the segregated South in 1965, is brutal to watch but essential. It’s beautifully made and powerfully acted — led by David Oyelowo’s charismatic and convincing turn as King — and it provides a useful lesson about the civil rights movement. But the cruelty and closed-mindedness it shows will be way too disturbing for most young viewers. DuVernay vividly depicts the violent, bloody backlash King and his fellow peaceful protesters endured, especially during their first attempt to march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. This is probably suitable for older tweens and up, but eventually, it’s a must-see movie for all young people.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Network, know, Paramount, blaxploitation, Apple, TV, movies, E3, 93rd, travel","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hot-pursuit-3.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-hot-pursuit-and-selma"},{"id":"47508914532284","title":"Parental Guidance: The Longest Ride","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Longest RideWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's movies.by Christy Lemire | April 10, 2015 |  CommentsThe Longest Ride 31%Rating: PG-13, for some sexuality, partial nudity, and some war and sports action.Tweens may swoon at the very sight of Scott Eastwood, son of Clint, who eerily resembles his father in his young, hunky Rawhide days. The fact that Eastwood is either riding a horse or a bull or conducting himself with cowboy courtliness makes the similarity especially uncanny. Tweens and older are also the suitable age for the romantic element of this Nicholas Sparks-novel fantasy about beautiful but extremely different people who fall for each other, but whose love is probably doomed. Eastwood plays a professional bull rider who insists he’s only staying in this dangerous game to keep his mom’s ranch afloat. Britt Robertson is the pretty art history major at Wake Forest University who’s headed to New York for a gallery internship after graduation. They enjoy a little partial nudity prior to their artfully lighted, tastefully photographed shower sex. Eastwood’s character also suffers serious injuries from some ornery bulls, which are difficult to watch. (Although the meanest and most vindictive one of all, Rango, seems to have been named after a delightful, animated movie starring Johnny Depp as a talking lizard.) A parallel plot involving flashbacks to a young couple during World War II features some violence during battle scenes and some serious conversations about infertility. In the present day, there’s also some language and collegiate drunkenness.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Mystery, YouTube, critic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/longest-ride-parental.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-the-longest-ride"},{"id":"47508916227015","title":"Parental Guidance: Strange Magic, Plus The Boxtrolls on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Strange Magic, Plus The Boxtrolls on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | January 23, 2015 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Strange Magic 18%Rating: PG, for some action and scary images.This is an animated, musical fantasy from the mind of George Lucas which also contains elements of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. If you think it sounds like there’s a lot going on there, you’re right. It all takes place in an enchanted land which has been split in two: There’s the Fairy Kingdom and the Dark Forest. A plucky fairy princess (voiced by Evan Rachel Wood) dares to enter the scary neighboring territory, where she makes an unexpected connection with the mean, lonely Bog King (Alan Cumming). And they do it all in song! Some of the colors and background elements are vibrantly colorful and beautifully detailed, but the characters’ and creatures’ faces are stiff and rubbery in an off-putting way. The music — a mix of pop songs from the past 60 years or so, ranging from Elvis Presley to Bob Marley to Beyonce — is incessant and overbearing. And some of the homelier creatures, including the Bog King (who’s some sort of insect hybrid), might frighten younger viewers. OK for most ages. But I’d go see Paddington first.New On DVD:The Boxtrolls 77%Rating: PG, for action, some peril and mild rude humor.The adventures in this family-friendly comedy are pretty tame — it’s the details that might freak your kids out a bit. The painstaking stop-motion animation results in a major dark streak and a prevailing grotesquery which may be too much for the youngest viewers. Beneath a quaintly dreary English village lives a population of creatures called the Boxtrolls. They are industrious and mischievous and misunderstood. They also have a young, orphaned boy living among them who’s known as Eggs (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) because they all take their names from the boxes they wear: Fish, Shoe, etc. A dastardly and socially ambitious villain with the Dickensian name of Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) promises the city’s leaders he’ll eradicate the town of all Boxtrolls if they’ll let him join their elite white hat society. Snatcher loves cheese (as everyone in town does) but he’s allergic to it, swelling in disgusting fashion from a single bite. Children are often in peril or neglected, and there’s a subplot involving kidnapping. Suitable for kids around 6 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Peek, spanish, TV, actors","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Parental-Guidance-Strange-Magic-Plus-The-Boxtrolls-on-DVD"},{"id":"47508914588613","title":"Parental Guidance: The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water and more","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water and moreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | February 6, 2015 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water 81%Rating: PG, for mild action and rude humor.This second feature-length SpongeBob SquarePants movie is zippy and zany and colorful and everything you want if you’re a fan of the long-running television series. This time, SpongeBob (voiced as always by Tom Kenny) and his pals must leave the watery safety of Bikini Bottom and venture onto dry land to track down the culprit who stole the secret formula for everyone’s favorite fast-food treat, the Krabby Patty. (Antonio Banderas appears in live-action sequences as a goofily villainous pirate.) The pop culture references and subversive humor will go over kids’ heads. There are a few gross-out jokes but they’re harmless. I brought my 5-year-old son and one of his friends to see this and they had a blast — jumping up and down, laughing and dancing. This is a good time for the whole family.Jupiter Ascending 27%Rating: PG-13, for some violence, sequences of sci-fi action, some suggestive content and partial nudity.A long, noisy and totally nutso sci-fi opera from the writing-directing Wachowskis, Lana and Andy. Mila Kunis stars as a Chicago maid who learns she’s actually the queen of the universe. Channing Tatum plays the half-man, half-dog protector who zooms around on jet-powered boots to save her whenever she’s in trouble (which is often). Big, dangerous chases and battles ensue as various members of a royal galactic family try to manipulate and even kill Kunis’ character to seize the kingdom. The sheer volume and running time will probably make this prohibitive for a lot of younger viewers. It’s just an overwhelming experience. There’s also a bit of nudity in a bathtub scene. More mature tweens with a taste for this kind of science fiction/fantasy material might dig it, though.Seventh Son 12%Rating: PG-13, for intense fantasy violence and action throughout, frightening images and brief strong language.In this supernatural action spectacle set in a distant past, Jeff Bridges stars as a mysterious knight who imprisoned a powerful witch (Julianne Moore) centuries ago. But now she’s escaped, and she gathers her various nefarious minions to seek revenge. The film is loosely based on the young adult series of Last Apprentice novels, so tweens may be familiar with the material, but much of this will probably be too visually intense and frightening for young viewers. The witch transforms into several scary creatures and there’s quite a bit of medieval swordplay and death. There’s also some romance, passionate kissing and implied sex. Probably best suited for mature tweens and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Network","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Parental-Guidance-The-SpongeBob-Movie-Sponge-Out-of-Water-and-more"},{"id":"47508916229064","title":"Parental Guidance: Paddington","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: PaddingtonWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | January 16, 2015 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Paddington 97%Rating: PG, for mild action and rude humor.This live-action/CGI-animated take on the tales of an adorable stuffed bear in Britain is, for the most part, completely suitable for the whole family. Ben Whishaw voices the beloved children’s book character in what is essentially an origin story. We see what prompted Paddington to leave Darkest Peru and travel to London, and how he ends up living with the Brown family. The tone is quite often gentle but dabbles in slight raunchiness here and there, including some literal toilet humor when Paddington has some trouble in the loo. But he does find himself in some peril at the hands of Nicole Kidman’s character, a ruthlessly driven taxidermist who wants to capture Paddington and add him to her museum collection. I brought my 5-year-old son with me, and Kidman’s character was the only element that bothered him: “I don?t like that mean girl,” he said. “‘Cause she’s scary.” Otherwise, though, “Paddington” is thoroughly cuddly and sweet.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"discovery, WarnerMedia, CW, Con, police, rt, Emmys, Binge, thriller","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Parental-Guidance-Paddington"},{"id":"47508917953500","title":"Parental Guidance: The Giver, Plus Muppets Most Wanted and Bears on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Giver, Plus Muppets Most Wanted and Bears on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | August 15, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Giver 35%Rating: PG-13, for mature thematic image and some sci-fi action/violence.This sci-fi drama/thriller is based on yet another Young Adult novel set in a rigid, post-war future. Naturally, this means one plucky teen will rise up and shake up the status quo for the benefit of the oppressed masses. Brenton Thwaites plays that teen, Jonas, who learns that he will become the keeper of all memory in this antiseptic, black-and-white community. Jeff Bridges plays the giver of the film’s title, who passes down the knowledge he’s been storing. This includes color, music and love but also violence, war and hatred, with a series of harrowing images flashing through the young man’s mind. Jonas and his girlfriend, Fiona (Odeya Rush), end up in danger when it becomes clear to the elders (led by Meryl Streep, no less) that they’ve begun thinking for themselves. There’s also a disturbing subplot involving the killing of infants who aren’t up to the community’s precise standards. For mature tweens and older.New On DVD:Muppets Most Wanted 80%Rating: PG, for some mild action.There is nothing even remotely inappropriate in this sequel to the 2011 Muppets reboot. In their latest singing and dancing extravaganza, the felt-covered friends find themselves performing in major cities across Europe. But there’s an impostor in their midst: an internationally infamous jewel thief named Constantine who happens to look exactly like Kermit the Frog. Miss Piggy is in peril (briefly) and the rest of the gang also ends up in peril (briefly) trying to rescue her. A hilarious Tina Fey plays the warden of the Siberian gulag where much of the action occurs, but the prison is portrayed in such a silly way that there’s nothing disturbing about it. Totally fine for all ages.Bears 90%Rating: G.Disney already has produced the documentaries Earth, Oceans, African Cats and Chimpanzees through its Disneynature label. Now they’re offering a close-up look at bears, who are mostly cuddly and adorable. The film follows a mama bear named Sky and her two cubs, Scout and Amber, as they dig out from their snowy cave in the Alaskan wilderness and head down the mountain to look for food. Dangers await, though, in the form of larger and hungrier bears and wolves as well as rising water and the threat of starvation. (But you’ll be happy to know that nothing nearly so gruesome as the bloody zebra mauling of African Cats occurs here.) There are a few tense moments but John C. Reilly’s amiable narration assures you that everything will be fine in the end. And the film is beautifully, intimately shot, so it’s at least worthwhile from a visual perspective. Suitable (and educational) for all ages.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"kong, IFC, Exclusive, Superheroes, National, bond, 2019, all-time, prank, best, thriller, Anna, Star, Bravo","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-giver-plus-muppets-most-wanted-and-bears-on-dvd"},{"id":"47508917940184","title":"Parental Guidance: Dolphin Tale 2, Plus Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and More on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Dolphin Tale 2, Plus Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and More on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | September 12, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Dolphin Tale 2 66%Rating: PG, for some mild thematic elements.This sequel to the 2011 family film Dolphin Tale is, like its predecessor, exceedingly earnest and harmless entertainment. But there’s something sort of sweet and quaint about that. Winter, the dolphin who was rescued in the first movie, now lives at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Florida and is learning to function with a high-tech prosthetic tail. But her status there is in jeopardy when — spoiler alert! — her elderly companion dolphin dies. I brought my almost-5-year-old son with me to the screening and the dolphin’s death — as well as the devastated reactions from the teens who worked with her — upset him. But for the most part, this is a film that?s all about teamwork and uplift. Fine for the whole family.New On DVD:Captain America: The Winter Soldier 90%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence, gunplay and action throughout.The second Captain America movie is chock full of shootouts, martial-arts butt kicking and the kind of prolonged, punishing brawls in which only physically altered specimens can engage. It’s pretty much what you’d expect from an effects-laden blockbuster based on a comic-book hero. But beneath the well-staged mayhem, the film ponders much darker themes, as well as a debate over freedom vs. security. This time, Cap (Chris Evans) must uncover a conspiracy within the secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. with the help of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). There’s an incredibly violent car chase that causes a ton of damage involving their boss, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), as well as a climactic battle in the skies above Washington featuring massive machines created to take out millions of people. This is probably fine for mature tweens and older.Brick Mansions 26%Rating: PG-13, for frenetic gunplay, action and violence throughout, language, sexual menace and drug material.The final film Paul Walker completed before dying in an auto accident in November 2013 is an English-language remake of the French cult hit District B13. It’s also a super-duper violent PG-13 movie full of thrilling chases, heavily armed goons, fiery explosions and elaborately choreographed martial-arts battles. Walker stars as an undercover officer who must infiltrate a seedy housing project in a crime-infested, dystopian Detroit. Walker’s character teams up with a longtime resident of the buildings (Parkour founder David Belle, reprising his role from the original) to take down the drug kingpin who rules the place (Wu-Tang Clan?s RZA). Along the way, a beautiful young woman is kidnapped and placed in some sexually perilous situations.

It follows the misadventures of a family in which one of the kids, Alexander (Ed Oxenbould), is having an atrocious day. While blowing out a birthday candle, he wishes that his happy, thriving parents and siblings could understand his misery and inadvertently curses them in the process. Madcap hilarity ensues, including a wrecked minivan, a Peter Pan performance that’s tainted by too much cough syrup and a baby consuming an entire green marker. There’s nothing even vaguely offensive here. Even when the male-stripper group the Thunder From Down Under shows up — don’t ask — they do a clean version of their routine. A solid choice for the whole family — even parents, who will find it surprisingly tolerable thanks in part to the likable presence of Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner as Alexander’s parents.St. Vincent 77%Rating: PG-13, for mature thematic material including sexual content, alcohol and tobacco use, and for language.Bill Murray is back in reliable curmudgeon mode as Vincent, a misanthropic alcoholic living in a shabby Brooklyn home. He finds his comfortable, anti-social routine shattered when a single mom (Melissa McCarthy) and her shy, bullied son (Jaeden Lieberher) move in next door and Vincent ends up serving as de factor babysitter. Despite its ultimate feel-good themes, there’s some mature stuff here. Vincent has an ongoing relationship with a pregnant, Russian stripper (Naomi Watts) and he takes the kid to a dive bar and the racetrack. (Besides his drinking problem, he also has a gambling problem as well as a smoking problem.) There’s also a subplot involving an elderly woman who’s in a nursing home with Alzheimer’s. And as the kid gains confidence, he punches out one of the classmates who had tormented him. This is probably suitable for sophisticated tweens and older.One Chance 63%Rating: PG-13, for some language and sexual material.This inspiring film is based on the true story of Paul Potts, a portly cell-phone salesman from working-class Wales who became an unlikely superstar singing opera to win the first season of Britain’s Got Talent. It’s pure formula, but James Corden is so irresistibly charming as Potts that you may as well give in. There are a few sexual references that will probably go over a lot of younger viewers’ heads. It’s suggested that Potts loses his virginity on his wedding night, but all we see is a little bit of chaste kissing. Also, he gets bullied as a kid by the mean boys who scoff at his sophisticated musical tastes. This is a nice story, solidly and efficiently told, and fine for tweens and older.New On DVD:Million Dollar Arm 65%Rating: PG, for mild language and suggestive content.Anyone who’s ever seen a feel-good Disney sports movie — which truly is its own genre by now — knows what they’re getting here. It’s an extremely wholesome film that’s fine for the whole family. Jon Hamm stars as agent J.B. Bernstein, who brings a couple of kids from India to the United States who’ve never played baseball in hopes of turning them into major-league pitchers. Nothing offensive or shocking happens here. The guys attend a lavish party where there’s poolside drinking with bikini-clad beauties, and one character who’d never tasted alcohol before ends up downing too much punch with messy consequences. (See? A teaching moment.) There’s also the suggestion that Hamm’s character spends the night with the woman who’s renting out his guesthouse, played by Lake Bell, but we don’t see anything beyond some innocent kissing.Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow 91%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language and brief suggestive material.When it came out in theaters, this Tom Cruise sci-fi thriller was called Edge of Tomorrow. Now it’s going by the poster tagline Live Die Repeat. Either way, this is an insanely violent PG-13 movie, but barely any blood results from the copious amounts of violence and death, so there you have it. Cruise’s character gets shot in the head over and over again, or monsters devour him, or a truck hits him. However it happens, he has to die repeatedly in order to reset his day and come back with more knowledge and slight tweaks to his actions each time. Think of it as a gruesome version of Groundhog Day. In the near future, creatures resembling giant, evil calamari have ravaged Earth. They’re fast-moving, spinning, climbing, flying — they’re totally frightening. Cruise, as a reluctant Army major, and Emily Blunt, as a famously fierce warrior, must work together to control time and stop the assault. Among the elements of the fight is a futuristic storming of the beach at Normandy featuring massive gunfire, exploding aircraft and general mayhem. Director Doug Liman’s film is extremely clever but definitely not suitable for anyone younger than their teens.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"zombie, Disney, Esquire, Disney, USA, GLAAD, song, movies, Arrangement, Women's, CW, screenings, Anna, history","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-alexander-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-and-much-more"},{"id":"47508919745517","title":"Parental Guidance: Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Island of Lemurs: Madagascar and More","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Island of Lemurs: Madagascar and MoreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | April 4, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Captain America: The Winter Soldier 90%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence, gunplay, and action throughout.As is always the case in these effects-laden blockbusters based on comic books, the second Captain America movie is chock full of shootouts, martial arts butt kicking and the kind of prolonged, punishing brawls in which only physically altered specimens can engage.

The playful yet intense primates are the focus of this beautiful and intimate 3-D IMAX documentary. Morgan Freeman narrates, sharing the story of how these furry creatures floated on a raft of vegetation across the Indian Ocean from Africa to a remote, exotic island 60 million years ago. Now, several kinds of lemur face extinction, as well as a shortage of rainforest in Madagascar because so much land has been burned for farming. It’s a powerful ecological message that older kids will understand; younger ones will probably just revel in the gorgeous imagery and the lemurs’ hilarious, adorable antics. Totally suitable for the entire family.New On DVD:Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues 75%Rating: PG-13, for drug use, crude and sexual content, comic violence, and language.You know what you’re getting here. If you’ve seen the 2004 cult comedy Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, you’re in for more of the same kind of raucous comedy in the sequel, in which Ron Burgundy and his pals help launch the first 24-hour cable news channel. Will Ferrell’s buffoonish news anchor and his equally inept colleagues smoke crack on the air, cavort with women in uncomfortable, lustful ways and take part in an even bigger brawl with their rival TV news teams. There’s a lot of over-the-top banging and clanging that goes on. It’s all very silly – would you expect anything different? – but it feels even more slapped together than usual for this genre. Still, this is probably fine for older kids and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"DC, on, 2019, Amazon, TV, globe, Alien, Creative","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-captain-america-the-winter-soldier-island-of-lemurs-madagascar-and-more"},{"id":"47508919737320","title":"Parental Guidance: Godzilla and Million Dollar Arm","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Godzilla and Million Dollar ArmWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | May 16, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Godzilla 76%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of destruction, mayhem and creature violence.Well, it’s a monster movie, so you can count on mass urban destruction and masses fleeing in terror. This time, the big green guy stomps his way across San Francisco as he battles a couple of other enormous creatures who thrive on radioactive materials. Thousands and thousands of people find themselves in peril including a school bus full of kids on the Golden Gate Bridge. It’s big and noisy and scary, as you would expect from a sci-fi summer blockbuster. But the 3-D special effects in director Gareth Edwards’ film are really sharp here — crisp, textural, visceral — making some of the battle sequences truly tense and terrifying. The sound design is also quite vivid, full of ominous creaks, groans and roars. This is probably suitable for kids around age 10 and older.Million Dollar Arm 65%Rating: PG, for mild language and suggestive content.This feel-good Disney sports movie — which is very much its own genre, with its own formula — is based on the true story of the search for baseball talent in India. Jon Hamm stars as agent J.B. Bernstein, who brings a couple of kids to the United States who’ve never played baseball and arranges training for them with the hope that they’ll become major-league pitchers. It’s an extremely wholesome story for the most part. The guys go to a lavish party where there’s poolside drinking with bikini-clad beauties, and one character who’d never tasted alcohol before ends up gulping down too much punch with messy consequences. There’s also the suggestion that Hamm’s character spends the night with the woman who’s renting out his guesthouse, played by Lake Bell, but we don’t see anything beyond some chaste kissing. This is fine for the whole family.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"stoner, furious, archives, Disney, Awards, Valentine's, series, Horse, Chernobyl, A24, Epix, DC, Carpet, Red","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-godzilla-and-million-dollar-arm"},{"id":"47508919733223","title":"Parental Guidance: X-Men: Days of Future Past and Blended, Plus Pompeii and Vampire Academy on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: X-Men: Days of Future Past and Blended, Plus Pompeii and Vampire Academy on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | May 22, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:X-Men: Days of Future Past 90%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action, some suggestive material, nudity and language.Key X-Men characters and the younger versions of themselves all factor into this time-travel drama, with Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine traversing both realms. One of the first images you see is of corpses being dumped from the back of a truck into the darkness of a terrifying, post-apocalyptic wasteland. This is an extremely violent and intense film, featuring massive set pieces with major destruction. Giant, flying robots known as Sentinels have been built to take out the mutants by shape shifting to adapt to their gifts. Prolonged fistfights and protracted gun battles abound. Magneto alone racks up the damage and casualties with just a casual hand gesture. OK for mature tweens and up.Blended 15%Rating: PG-13, for crude and sexual content, and language.Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore team up for the third time, following The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates, as single parents who initially clash but eventually end up getting together and blending their five combined kids during a lavish trip to Africa. This is a comparatively tame Sandler movie in terms of the gross-out factor. There’s no projectile vomit, no messy excrement. There is one joke about urination but it’s actually relevant in context. Computer-generated rhinos cavort and a giraffe gives a teenage boy an unexpected tongue kiss. Speaking of kissing, a couple of newlyweds make out incessantly (and the young wife is especially jiggly). There’s also a running bit about Barrymore’s 13-year-old son’s affection for masturbation. This is probably fine for tweens and up.New On DVD:Pompeii 27%Rating: PG-13, for intense battle sequences, disaster-related action and brief sexual content.Stabbings, impalings, beheadings — name a brutal way for men to destroy each other and it’s probably in here. And that’s long before the volcano goes boom and starts shooting fireballs at the innocent citizens of Pompeii. This telling of the ancient eruption of Mount Vesuvius is a massively violent PG-13 disaster movie — but it’s all rendered with slick, computer-generated effects. Hunky gladiators beat their opponents bloody and tear into each other with their mighty swords. In the midst of the mayhem, bland young lovers Milo (Kit Harington) and Cassia (Emily Browning) scurry to survive — but they still find for unintentionally hilarious romance. This is probably OK for young teens but truly, I’d choose something else if you have some options. Something, you know, good.Vampire Academy 16%Rating: PG-13, for violence, bloody images, sexual content and language.This hyper-verbal, smart-alecky action comedy is based on the series of young adult novels of the same name. It follows the adventures of teen vampire royalty and the guardians who’ve been assigned to protect them. Then there are the evil, immortal vampires who want to lure them to the dark side. Just as scary are the daily dramas of high school life, which best friends Lissa (Lucy Fry), the royal, and Rose (Zoey Deutsch), her protector, must navigate. There’s a ton of blood sucking, hand-to-hand combat, stabbings and general peril. There’s also a subplot about animal mutilation and some gossip about a female character engaging in a ménage a trois with two male classmates. Both might prove to be gnarly topics of discussion afterward. Fine for the target YA audience of tween and teen girls.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"frames, Rey, First, Pop, political, zombie, the, 2021, Crackle","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-x-men-days-of-future-past-and-blended-plus-pompeii-and-vampire-academy-on-dvd"},{"id":"47508921402357","title":"Parental Guidance: The Lego Movie, Vampire Academy and Monuments Men, Plus Free Birds","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Lego Movie, Vampire Academy and Monuments Men, Plus Free BirdsWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | February 7, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Lego Movie 96%Rating: PG, for mild action and rude humor.A hilarious and high-spirited adventure that adults actually might enjoy more than their kids. (At least that was the case in our house with our 4-year-old son.) Chris Pratt provides the voice of Emmet, an ordinary construction worker Lego who discovers a mysterious piece of red plastic, thereby fulfilling a prophecy from an ancient mystic (Morgan Freeman). Emmet is now believed to be The Special, the one who will save the Lego universe from destruction. There’s nothing really shocking or inappropriate here; the bad guys, including the megalomaniacal Lord Business (Will Ferrell), are too amusingly cartoonish to be scary. The obliteration of Lego worlds that occurs looks a lot like what happens when kids create towers and characters and then smash them to bits. But there is a third-act twist that supplies a surprising amount of emotion; it may shake your kids up a bit and bring a tear to grown-ups’ eyes, too.Vampire Academy 16%Rating: PG-13, for violence, bloody images, sexual content and language.Based on the series of young adult novels about teen vampire royalty and the guardians assigned to protect them from the evil, immortal vampires who want to lure then over to the dark side. Best friends Lissa (Lucy Fry) and Rose (Zoey Deutch) also must navigate the daily dramas of high school, which they accomplish with the help of cheeky banter. Plenty of blood-sucking, hand-to-hand-combat, stabbings and general peril abounds. There’s also a subplot involving bloody animal mutilation, which is a tad gnarly. And among the high-school gossip about various hook-ups is the suggestion that one of the female characters took part in a ménage a trois with a couple of male classmates. So that awkward conversation awaits you. Mostly suitable for the tween/teen girl audience the books targets, as well.The Monuments Men 30%Rating: PG-13, for some images of war violence and historical smoking.George Clooney directed, co-wrote and stars in this World War II drama about a ragtag band of art historians who pretend to be U.S. Army soldiers to rescue priceless paintings and sculptures that Adolf Hitler stole. It’s based on a real-life story but doesn’t have much life to it, despite a starry cast that includes Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray and John Goodman. Still, because the film takes place during a war, not all members of the team make it out alive. There’s also a ton of gunfire, explosions and a tense scene in which one of the characters discovers he’s stepped on a landmine. Plus, you know, there’s that pesky dilemma of having to explain who Hitler was. Fine for tweens and teens.New On DVD:Free Birds 20%Rating: PG, for some action/peril and rude humor.One of the flattest and least funny animated films I’ve ever seen. But if this is the only movie available for the whole family to watch, it’s pretty harmless. Owen Wilson provides his distinctive, nasal twang as the voice of Reggie, a turkey who realizes he and his buddies are all being fattened up for Thanksgiving dinners. He and an amped-up turkey named Jake (Woody Harrelson) go back in time to the first Thanksgiving to keep their kind off the menu for good. There’s a jumble of stuff going on here – characters, themes, ideas – as well as a big battle scene, but it provides more spectacle than scares. And a metaphorical subplot involving the plight of Native Americans in the United States will probably go over kids’ heads.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Bros.","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-lego-movie-vampire-academy-and-monuments-men-plus-free-birds"},{"id":"47508921423866","title":"Parental Guidance: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and Justin Bieber’s Believe","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and Justin Bieber's BelieveWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | December 27, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Secret Life of Walter Mitty 51%Rating: PG, for some crude comments, language and action violence.Ben Stiller’s take on the classic James Thurber story feels like the actor-director is working through a mid-life crisis with a big budget and blockbuster special effects. Stiller stars as the meek title character, whose vivid fantasy world becomes reality when he’s forced to embark on a globetrotting adventure. There are a couple scenes of peril: a pursuit through the packed streets of Manhattan, an erupting volcano. And Walter’s boss, played by an arrogant Adam Scott, is a total jerk. But for the most part this inanely uplifting story about overcoming your fears and chasing your dreams is pretty darn harmless.Justin Bieber’s Believe 53%Rating: PG, for brief language and mild thematic material.This second documentary chronicling the behind-the-scenes life of pop phenom Justin Bieber wasn’t shown to critics before its Christmas Day opening. But it comes from Jon M. Chu, the same director who brought us 2011’s Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. That first film was a big, glossy celebration of a musical superstar on the rise, a young man with talent and poise beyond his years. Since then, Bieber has proven himself human, and fallible, as he’s made the sort of high-profile mistakes so many young celebrities do. Clips from the new film suggest that he’s achieved an awareness of the perils of fame while still exuding enough impish enthusiasm to keep his loyal fans squealing with glee. Oh yes, and it’s got tons of concert footage to appease those fervent Beliebers.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Writers, lord, Lionsgate, thirty, natural","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-secret-life-of-walter-mitty-and-justin-biebers-believe"},{"id":"47508923011080","title":"Parental Guidance: Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 and Baggage Claim","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 and Baggage ClaimWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | September 27, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 71%Rating: PG, for mild rude humor.This 3-D animated sequel to the 2009 hit, which made $243 million worldwide, finds the once-tranquil island of Swallow Falls being overtaken by marauding hybrid creatures known as Foodimals. While the original film played on disaster-movie conventions, this one plays with monster-movie motifs, with Shrimpamzees and Tacodiles taking over. It’s big and loud and messy but not terribly scary. The only thing that’s even vaguely inappropriate is flatulence humor — something that makes all kids giggle — and adults are likely to groan at the bad puns.Baggage Claim 15%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content and some language.This painfully clichéd romantic comedy, which is neither romantic nor funny, finds Paula Patton playing a flight attendant named Montana Moore, who’s desperate to get engaged before her younger sister gets married. Not only does she have a deadline of 30 days to achieve this feat, she also uses her access to flights all over the country to “accidentally” bump into her exes. Moms and dads, this is a terrible message for your young girls to hear. The idea that being someone’s wife is the best way for a woman to define herself is archaic and insulting – and the most offensive part of the entire film. There’s also a cartoonishly romanticized love scene and plenty of sexual innuendo from Jill Scott as Patton’s obligatory saucy best friend.Muscle Shoals 97%Rating: PG, for thematic elements, language, smoking and brief partial nudity.A hugely enjoyable, thoroughly researched documentary about the tiny Alabama town where a ton of classic music from the 1960s and ’70s was recorded. From Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett to the Rolling Stones and Traffic to Lynyrd Skynyrd and Bob Seger, a wide range of acts discovered and honed their sounds at a couple of modest studios that nonetheless became legendary. Because these are rock stars we’re talking about here, captured both through archival photos and new interviews, there’s some drinking and smoking but nothing shocking. There’s also a tiny bit of nudity, courtesy of those long-haired hippie rockers the Allman Brothers. Great for older kids who are interested in music beyond insipid Top-40 radio.New On DVD:Iron Man 3 79%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout, and brief suggestive content.All the obligatory destruction you’d expect from a massive summer blockbuster — especially a sequel based on a comic-book superhero — is on full display here. It’s the stuff of computer-generated imagery but, you know, still spectacular. A rocket eviscerates Tony Stark’s (Robert Downey Jr.) cliffside Shangri-La high above the Malibu shore, for example. It’s not exactly frightening stuff, but it can be harrowing. Tony’s main squeeze, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), also finds herself in peril, but finds her inner iron woman eventually. And oh yes, the whole thing is propelled by a terrorist plot, but it’s really more of an idea that provides the opportunity for us to gawk at more cool gadgetry.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"History, Grant, Podcast, Day, docudrama, universal, Sundance, Infographic, Endgame, Hear, Cosplay, Shondaland","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-2-and-baggage-claim"},{"id":"47508921442306","title":"Parental Guidance: Thor: The Dark World, Plus White House Down, Grown Ups 2 and more!","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Thor: The Dark World, Plus White House Down, Grown Ups 2 and more!We give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | November 8, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Thor: The Dark World 66%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence, and some suggestive content.This sequel to the 2011 hit Thor is pure spectacle – massive amounts of pixelated carnage, a repetitive and numbing barrage of noisy sameness. The battles are so big and messy and so full of over-the-top creatures, the Marvel comic-inspired mayhem barely registers as anything recognizable. The hunky, hammer-wielding Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must fight to restore peace and balance to the cosmos when an ancient, evil force threatens to take over during some sort of rare harmonic convergence. One well-chosen snarl from his evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is more disturbing than any of the on-screen fights. Oh, and giant chunks of London get flattened by space ships – but again, the violence to too cartoonish to be truly frightening. Fine for older kids, maybe 9 and up.New On DVD:White House Down 52%Rating: PG-13, for prolonged sequences of action and violence including intense gunfire and explosions, some language and a brief sexual image.It’s sort of astonishing that this movie got a PG-13 rating, given the insane amount of gunfire, explosions and carnage it contains. After all, this is a Roland Emmerich movie. But! Unlike that other recent (and similar) White-House-under-siege film Olympus Has Fallen, which was rated R, there’s barely any bloodshed. It’s just as numbing but not nearly so gruesome. So there you have it. This time, Channing Tatum must save our nation’s capital and protect a president under attack. What troubled me, as a mother, was seeing Joey King, as Tatum’s 11-year-old daughter, being used as a pawn — watching her get roughed up by bad guys, including having a gun repeatedly placed to her head. She’s a tough girl who can stand up for herself, but the extent to which the villains abuse her as a source of audience thrills seemed gratuitous. These images may not disturb older kids, but they’ll likely bother their parents. Also: Jamie Foxx, as the Obamaesque president, drops the one F-bomb you get with a PG-13 rating.Grown Ups 2 8%Rating: PG-13, for crude and suggestive content, language and some male rear nudity.I cannot imagine why most kids would want to tag along with Adam Sandler and their man-child friends as they stumble through a series of gross and crass sight gags, then get in touch with their feelings as they learn to embrace middle age. But for older kids who might get a kick out of puerile humor, this sequel to the 2010 hit Grown Ups features, but is not limited to: fart jokes, pee jokes, poop jokes, vomit jokes, jokes about boobs, jokes about butts and jokes about stoned, bi-polar school bus drivers. Otherwise known as Sandler’s oeuvre. There is smart and clever slapstick humor out there – share it with your children instead.Parkland 50%Rating: PG-13, for bloody sequences of ER trauma procedures, some violent images and language, and smoking throughout.Thematically, this recreation of the JFK assassination is probably best for older kids. A star-studded cast including Zac Efron, Marcia Gay Harden, Paul Giamatti, Billy Bob Thornton, Jacki Weaver takes us through those horrific days from the perspective of various people involved in the event. They include Secret Service and FBI agents, Abraham Zapruder (who famously shot the film that captured the killing) and the trauma surgeons at Dallas’ Parkland Hospital, where the president ultimately was pronounced dead. Although director Peter Landesman takes a detached, matter-of-fact tone — and doesn’t show us the shooting itself — he still depicts a graphically bloody scene, which would be uncomfortable for anyone to watch.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"boxoffice, Black, Apple, high, The, york, Reality, 2020, Shudder, miniseries","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-thor-the-dark-world-plus-white-house-down-grown-ups-2-and-more"},{"id":"47508923015179","title":"Parental Guidance: One Direction: This is Us and Getaway","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: One Direction: This is Us and GetawayWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | August 29, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:One Direction: This is Us 63%Rating: PG, for mild language.There is nothing even vaguely shocking or inappropriate in this extended infomercial about the British boy-band sensation. No groupies, no partying, no infighting. There’s nothing terribly insightful, either. Director Morgan Spurlock made his name with documentaries like Super Size Me, which examined the power of corporate culture; here, he’s a cog in that very machinery. His film follows the pre-fab five — Harry, Zayn, Niall, Liam and Louis — on stage and behind the scenes of their world tour. Spurlock has said he intended this as his version of A Hard Day’s Night, and while it does feature the lads enjoying some mildly wacky antics, these are no Beatles. They barely even have distinguishable personalities. Totally suitable for fans of any age, and tolerable for the parents who are forced to drive them to the theater.Getaway 3%Rating: PG-13, for intense action, violence and mayhem throughout, some rude gestures, and language.An insane number of cars gets demolished in the name of mindless summer entertainment. Innocent bystanders get mowed down, property is destroyed and general mayhem rules the streets. In the center of it all, causing this damage on command in hopes that he’ll be able to save his kidnapped wife, is Ethan Hawke. As the awesomely named Brent Magna, Hawke plays a washed-up racecar driver who’s stuck in a stolen, souped-up car following the cruel and arbitrary instructions of a disembodied voice (Jon Voight) who has orchestrated his wife’s abduction. Then Selena Gomez shows up as the car’s owner and becomes his hostage, then his unwitting partner. The two trade stilted, profane banter.New On DVD:The Great Gatsby 48%Rating: PG-13, for some violent images, sexual content, smoking, partying and brief language.Decadent partying permeates this film, which should come as no surprise to anyone who read the classic F. Scott Fitzgerald novel that inspired it in 10th-grade English class. Reclusive, nouveau-riche Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) tries to win back his lost love, the dazzling socialite Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), by staging a series of elaborate soirees that he hopes will catch her attention. Much cigarette smoking and swilling of champagne ensues. Everyone eventually goes home, though, leaving Gatsby to his violent, tragic fate. Director Baz Luhrmann depicts it all lavishly – and in 3-D, no less. But he doesn’t seem to get the melancholy soul of the novel: the loneliness, and the crumbling of the American dream. Totally fine for tweens and high-school kids.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Network, Ice, medical, Peek, Awards, Animation, 2018, Comic, teaser, 2020","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-one-direction-this-is-us-and-getaway"},{"id":"47508923008006","title":"Parental Guidance: Captain Phillips, Plus After Earth and Europa Report","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Captain Phillips, Plus After Earth and Europa ReportWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | October 10, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Captain Phillips 93%Rating: PG-13, for sustained intense sequences of menace, some violence with bloody images, and substance abuse.It?s stunning that this film has a PG-13 rating. Paul Greengrass’ thriller, based on the true story of Somali pirates who took over an American cargo ship in 2009, is hugely violent, bloody and intense for nearly all of its two-plus-hour running time. Tom Hanks stars as the title character, a veteran, all-business captain who must find creative ways to appease the pirates while also protecting his crew and trying to communicate with emergency officials and the military. There’s a ton of gunfire, stabbings, slicings, beatings, a kidnapping and — eventually ?- several deaths. The action is both visceral and claustrophobic, with men on both sides trapped in cramped quarters fighting for their lives. One of the hardest parts to watch, though, is Captain Phillips’ cumulative shock once the ordeal is over. This is probably suitable for teenagers at the youngest.New On DVD:After Earth 11%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi action violence and some disturbing images.This movie is terrible, regardless of how old you or your kids are. Speaking of kids, Will Smith’s teenage son, Jaden, is the true star here and gets top billing over his more famous dad. Perhaps the most potentially disturbing element for younger viewers in M. Night Shyamalan’s film is the fact that Jaden Smith’s character must fend for himself, away from his father, in a toxic, post-apocalyptic version of our planet once the spaceship they?re riding in crash lands. He must survive severe fluctuations in the elements and slay giant, fake-looking, computer-generated monsters, which are more yucky than scary. This is probably OK for tweens and up.Europa Report 81%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi action and peril.A great pick for older kids with an interest in science fiction and space exploration. This faux documentary is based on the now-familiar found-footage conceit but it’s inspired by a real-life breakthrough finding. It follows six superstar astronauts gathered from around the globe who travel to Jupiter’s moon Europa to confirm the existence of water and — more importantly — ocean life. Nine months into the journey, they lose contact with Earth — and that’s when things start getting scary. In classic horror-movie fashion, they find themselves being picked off, one by one, by the various dangers that lurk in the vast darkness. But the situations they find themselves in are tense without being graphic, and the way people perish is never gory.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Peek, Prime, fiction, robots, Mudbound, Swim, FX, canceled, on, 2017, Walt, Musical, Christmas, crossover, movie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-captain-phillips-plus-after-earth-and-europa-report"},{"id":"47508923012105","title":"Parental Guidance: The Wizard of Oz: An IMAX 3-D Experience and Enough Said","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Wizard of Oz: An IMAX 3-D Experience and Enough SaidWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | September 19, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Wizard of Oz: An IMAX 3-D Experience 99%Rating: GIt’s The Wizard of Oz, so you know of the deathly horrors that await: the Wicked Witch of the West, that dark ominous corridor, those flying monkeys. I’m a grown woman and I’m still afraid of the flying monkeys, so I can only imagine how much more terrifying they’d be in 3-D on that giant IMAX screen. I’d pondered taking my son, who’s almost 4, to see it over the weekend but was advised by three different moms (two of whom are pediatricians) that he’s still too young for such an experience. So parents, maybe wait until your kids are age 5 or 6 – and show it to them at home, first, where they can hide comfortably behind the coffee table.Enough Said 95%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content, some thematic material and brief language.James Gandolfini is lovely in writer-director Nicole Holofcener’s midlife romantic comedy — gentle, sweet and self-deprecating — but the fact that this was his last performance before dying of a heart attack this summer makes it that much more poignant. Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus co-star as a couple of divorced, single parents in Los Angeles who fall for each other with some eventual complications. There’s no real nudity but we do see them in bed together, and Louis-Dreyfus shares some frank sex talk with a couple of her friends (played by Toni Collette and Catherine Keener) as well as her teenage daughter and her best friend.New On DVD:Epic 65%Rating: PG, for mild action, some scary images and brief rude humor.So I can only speak to the first hour so of this film, because that’s the point at which my son, who was then 3 ½, decided he was scared and wanted to leave. Apply that tidbit as you will to your own children of that age. Much of the imagery in this 3-D animated adventure is colorful and wondrous, as tiny creatures are fighting a battle of good and evil within a secret universe in the forest. The scenery can be vibrant and verdant, but when the bad guys are on screen, the skies turn dark and the surroundings become harsher. (This should come as no surprise given that Christoph Waltz voices the lead villain.) Suitable for nearly all ages.World War Z 66%Rating: PG-13, for intense frightening zombie sequences, violence and disturbing images.One of the most graphic PG-13 movies I’ve ever seen. A pandemic sweeps the globe, turning people into convulsing, flailing, ravenous zombies within seconds. Heavy-duty gunfire, pandemonium and a general obliteration of civilized society as we know it ensues. And only Brad Pitt, as a former investigator for the United Nations, can stop the madness. This is an incredibly stressful film to watch. But the imagery may look familiar, and perhaps not all that frightening, for pre-teens who’ve played a lot of first-person-shooter video games.The East 76%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements, violence, some disturbing images, sexual content and partial nudity.There is a healthy amount of naked Alexander Skarsgard in this movie. Not that anyone’s complaining, but FYI, it exists. Actually, this thriller features quite a few creepy, sexualized rituals as an undercover corporate agent (Brit Marling) infiltrates a cult of eco-activist anarchists. Some disturbing imagery appears at the film’s start — birds and sea life that have been the victims of massive oil spills, for example — followed by violent acts scattered throughout as this underground group gets its theatrical revenge.Bless Me, Ultima 68%Rating: PG-13, for some violence and sexual references.The classic piece of Chicano literature that inspired this film also has inspired some serious controversy since its publication in 1972. Some church groups and parents have decried Rudolfo Anaya’s novel as anti-Catholic or too profane and pushed to have it banned from school districts across the country. The film itself, though, is a mostly gentle and tastefully photographed depiction of a young boy’s coming of age in rural 1940s New Mexico. His maturation includes a questioning of the Catholic faith of his parents and a curiosity about the Native American mysticism of his elders. But such musings feel more like an inherent part of the progression into adolescence than an intentionally subversive force.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"theme, video","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-wizard-of-oz-an-imax-3-d-experience-and-enough-said"},{"id":"47508923026447","title":"Parental Guidance: The Smurfs 2 and Europa Report","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Smurfs 2 and Europa ReportWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | August 2, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Smurfs 2 14%Rating: PG, for some rude humor and action.It would be perfectly appropriate for you to take kids of all ages to this blue-tinted, live-action extravaganza. Beyond the random fart joke, not much happens that seems terribly deserving of a PG rating. But if you truly love them, why would you take them to see this? It’s flat, humorless, repetitive and jam-packed with cringe-inducing Smurf puns. The plot briefly places a few of the Smurfs in peril, as the villainous Gargamel (a straining Hank Azaria) kidnaps Smurfette (voiced by Katy Perry) to extract her essence and use it to turn unsuspecting fools into his disciples. The humor is slapsticky and sometimes gross but without much inspiration or finesse. My 3 ½-year-old son, who’s been to a lot of movies in his young life, said this is the worst one he’s seen yet. And he’s seen The Oogieloves.Europa Report 81%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi action and peril.This stripped-down mash-up of found-footage faux documentary and quiet, sci-fi meditation has the traditional structure of a horror flick, with characters being picked off one by one by the dangers that lurk out in the dark, vast beyond. It’s a fictional story inspired by a real-life breakthrough finding, with six of the world’s brightest astronauts traveling to Jupiter’s moon Europa to confirm the existence of water and — more importantly — ocean life. About nine months into their journey, they lose contact with Earth — and that’s when things start getting scary. But the perilous situations they find themselves in are tense without being graphic, and the way people perish is never gory. Europa Report is totally suitable — and very much recommended — for older kids with a curiosity about science.New On DVD:G.I. Joe: Retaliation 28%Rating: PG-13, for combat violence and martial arts action throughout, and for brief sensuality and language.It’s a big, dumb action movie that knows it’s a big, dumb action movie — which, in theory, makes this sequel preferable in some ways to big, dumb action movies that are under that delusion that they’re serious art. This is an astonishingly violent PG-13 movie. There’s an insane amount of gunfire, much of which comes courtesy of Bruce Willis as a retired Joe who cheerily shares the arsenal he’s hidden in his quiet, suburban home. But none of the casualties from all this sophisticated weaponry results in any blood. This being a big-studio blockbuster based on a toy, nothing really matters — even he obliteration of a major world city with the touch of a button.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"American, BAFTA, National, drama","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-smurfs-2-and-europa-report"},{"id":"47508924117010","title":"Parental Guidance: Pacific Rim and Grown Ups 2","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Pacific Rim and Grown Ups 2We give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | July 12, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Pacific Rim 72%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence through, and brief language.Monsters wreak spectacular havoc on major cities across the globe, and giant robots battle them for the future of humanity: It’s a fantastically fun, marvelously mounted summer escape. For younger kids, the underwater monsters who’ve burst from the deep to destroy us — the kaiju, as they’re called — might be a little too scary. Director Guillermo del Toro does not mess around when it comes to his creatures, so the beasts here have clever, vividly detailed features. And there is one sequence that’s absolutely terrifying for viewers of any age: a flashback in which a young girl runs through the ravaged Japanese streets, sobbing in fear as she tries to escape the monster that has just killed her parents.Grown Ups 2 8%Rating: PG-13, for crude and suggestive content, language and male rear nudity.Fart jokes. Pee jokes. Poop jokes. Vomit jokes. Jokes about boobs. Jokes about butts. Jokes about stoned, bi-polar school bus drivers. If you are not shocked or offended by any of these de rigueur elements of an Adam Sandler comedy, and you think your older kids will get a mindless kick out of such puerile humor, then sure, Grown Ups 2 is suitable. They may giggle at the gross-out gags, but the alleged “meat” of the film — the midlife crisis that Sandler and his pals Chris Rock, Kevin James and David Spade are experiencing — will probably go over their heads. Still, if you truly love your kids, you won’t subject them to such lazy, cynical trash.New On DVD:Admission 39%Rating: PG-13 for language and some sexual material.Tina Fey and Paul Rudd team up for the first time ever in a comedy that sadly squanders their immense likability. Fey plays an uptight admissions officer at Princeton University; Rudd is a former classmate of hers who now runs a crunchy-granola alternative high school, who’s pushing her to consider one of his top students. Besides some profanity, nothing really shocking occurs, but there are a few mature plot points that may prompt some awkward questions from younger kids. There’s a subplot involving an affair that leads to a pregnancy. Fey and Rudd share a shower scene but there’s no real visible nudity. And Lily Tomlin enjoys some risqué moments as Fey’s maverick-feminist mother.The Host 10%Rating: PG-13, for some sensuality and violence.Since it’s based on a book by Stephenie Meyer, author of the Twilight series, this sci-fi thriller would seem tailor-made for her same core fan base of tween and teen girls. Yes, the content is suitable for them; young people find themselves in danger here, but no more or less so than in a fevered girl-vampire-werewolf love triangle. Saoirse Ronan plays a headstrong 17-year-old in a post-apocalyptic future (is there any other kind?) who refuses to let her body be taken over by a nomadic Soul. There is some gun violence and a bit of bloodshed, but the real offense is just how silly it all feels.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"TV, video, ghosts, archives, Christmas, YouTube, comiccon, Avengers, History, Sci-Fi, Fox, HBO, Games","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-pacific-rim-and-grown-ups-2"},{"id":"47508924122132","title":"Parental Guidance: White House Down and A Band Called Death","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: White House Down and A Band Called DeathWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | June 28, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:White House Down 52%Rating: PG-13, for prolonged sequences of action and violence including intense gunfire and explosions, some language and a brief sexual image.Yet another White-House-under-siege movie? So soon? Just a few months after the release of Olympus Has Fallen, our nation’s capital once again is being attacked on screen. The difference is, that film was rated R, so you saw the physical consequence of massive gun battles. The PG-13 White House Down has the kind of insane violence you’d expect from director Roland Emmerich — both up-close-and-personal shootings in close quarters and barrages of automatic gunfire from the skies — but with barely any blood. It’s just as numbing but not nearly so gruesome. More troubling to me, as a mom, was watching Joey King, as Channing Tatum’s 11-year-old daughter, being used as a pawn — seeing her roughed up by bad guys, including having a gun placed to her head several times. She’s a tough girl capable of standing up for herself, but the extent to which the villains abuse her as a source of audience thrills seemed gratuitous and made me uneasy. Whether or not these images disturb older kids, they’ll likely bother their parents. Also: Jamie Foxx, as the Obamaesque president, drops the one F-bomb you get with a PG-13 rating.A Band Called Death 94%Rating: Unrated but contains language and smoking.This documentary is actually a great choice for kids this week, especially if they’re into music or are aspiring performers themselves. It traces the origins of a long-forgotten band called Death, hence the title: three black, teenage brothers from Detroit who pioneered the punk sound in the early 1970s, long before the Sex Pistols or the Ramones. Their songs completely rock and stand up with just as much vibrancy and vitality today. But the story of how they taught themselves to play in their modest home, worked tirelessly to perfect their sound and hustled to get their music out to the world is a terrific lesson for young people — especially those for whom American Idol is the standard for achieving success.New On DVD:The Incredible Burt Wonderstone 38%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content, dangerous stunts, a drug-related incident and language.Steve Carell pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of being unlikable as an arrogant Las Vegas magician whose longtime act has grown outdated and unpopular. Jim Carrey, as a gonzo, Criss Angel-style street performer with a cable TV show called “Brain Rapist,” steals his spotlight and his audience. His stunts are outrageously over-the-top: ridiculous stuff like sleeping overnight on hot coals and holding his urine for several days straight. In theory, it’s all too cartoonish to give your kids any ideas, but who knows? Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to have that talk with them about not trying this stuff at home. Especially if you have boys.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Tyler, Plus, Signature, talk, drama, Mudbound, Network, Musical, Lifetime, USA, Drama, 4/20","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-white-house-down-and-a-band-called-death"},{"id":"47508925852715","title":"Parental Guidance: Taken 2 and Won’t Back Down","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Taken 2 and Won't Back DownWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | January 17, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;It’s been a rough month for family-friendly theatrical releases, so once again we look to the DVD shelf, where we find an action sequel (Taken 2) and an education drama (Won’t Back Down). Read on to find out what’s appropriate for the whole family.New On DVD:Taken 2 22%What’s it about? Liam Neeson is back as retired CIA agent Bryan Mills, who must use every skill in his arsenal when he and his ex-wife are kidnapped in Istanbul by the vengeance-driven family members of the folks who abducted Mills’ daughter last time.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 “for intense sequences of violence and action, and some sensuality.” It’s probably nothing your teens haven’t seen before, but it’s certainly too much for anyone younger.Is it any good? Critics say Taken 2 is essentially a rehash of its predecessor, but without the logic, coherence, and excitement required to keep it fresh.Won’t Back Down 35%What’s it about? Viola Davis and Maggie Gyllenhaal star as a teacher and a single mom, respectively, who become so disillusioned by the bureaucratic rigidity of the local public school system that they start a grass-roots movement to wrest control from the teachers union.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG “for thematic elements and language.” It’s probably safe for kids, though they might not want to watch a movie about education policy; teens may be more receptive.Is it any good? Critics say Won’t Back Down is well-acted, but its script fails to lend dramatic heft or sophistication to the hot-button issue of education reform.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"language, thriller, Acorn, prank, Games, romantic, marvel, Animation, series, Geo, halloween","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-taken-2-and-wont-back-down"},{"id":"47508925841446","title":"Parental Guidance: Snitch, Dark Skies, and Fun Size","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Snitch, Dark Skies, and Fun SizeWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | February 22, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;As the eyes of the movie world turn to the Oscars, we’d like to remind you that there are a couple new viewing options out there this week. We’ve got a pair of new wide releases (Snitch, Dark Skies), as well as a teen-friendly rental (Fun Size). Read on to find out what’s appropriate for the whole family.In Theaters This Week:Snitch 57%What’s it about? Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson stars as a father who infiltrates a drug ring after his son is wrongly accused of drug trafficking.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “drug content and sequences of violence.” It’s probably safe for teens, and families can certainly have a discussion about the film’s theme of parental responsibility.Is it any good? The critics say Snitch is a smart, thoughtful crime thriller with a strong performance from Johnson.Dark Skies 41%What’s it about? A family moves into a suburban house and is increasingly subjected to terrifying and inexplicable events that seem to be supernatural in origin.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “for violence, terror throughout, sexual material, drug content and language — all involving teens.” So yeah — leave the kids at home.Is it any good? The film isn’t being screened in advance for critics, which is never a good sign.New On DVD:Fun Size 25%What’s it about? Victoria Justice stars as Wren, a high school senior tasked with watching her little brother Albert on Halloween. However, the little guy gets lost while trick-or-treating, and Wren must round up a posse to track him down; hilarity ensues.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “crude and suggestive material, partying and language.” Despite coming from Nickelodeon Studios, this is definitely a movie for teens, as it’s a bit too raunchy for younger viewers.Is it any good? Critics say Fun Size is pleasant but innocuous, decent teen fare with a few laughs and a lot of predictability.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"TV, Pacific, CMT, Walt, Valentine's, indie, Mary, Max, TV, Series","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-snitch-dark-skies-and-fun-size"},{"id":"47508924152864","title":"Parental Guidance: Jurassic Park: An IMAX 3D Experience","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Jurassic Park: An IMAX 3D ExperienceWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | April 4, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;This week in family viewing, we’ve got an oldie but goodie.

On DVD and Blu-ray, we’ve got the spy thriller The Bourne Legacy and the animated sequel Ice Age: Continental Drift. Read on to find out what’s appropriate for the whole family.In Theaters This Week:The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey 64%What’s it about? Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf go on a journey to recapture the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from an evil dragon, meeting some wild characters — including the mischievous Gollum — along the way.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “for extended sequences of intense fantasy action violence, and frightening images.” The film features beheadings, stabbings, characters in peril, and scary orcs and trolls, among other things, so you should probably leave the little ones at home, though teens will be fine with it.Is it any good? Critics say The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a notable step down from the Lord of the Rings trilogy — though it’s visually stunning and well acted, it’s also overlong and sometimes feels overextended.New On DVD:The Bourne Legacy 55%What’s it about? Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is a chemically-enhanced super-soldier who discovers that the secret government agency that gave him his powers is trying to kill him, so he goes on the run.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “violence and action sequences.” It’s safe for teens, but Aaron Cross’ various escapes from peril are certainly too much for younger viewers.Is it any good? Critics say that while The Bourne Legacy is a bit overlong and more disjointed than previous installments, it’s still a capable chase thriller with strong action scenes.Ice Age: Continental Drift 37%What’s it about? Scrat the saber-toothed squirrel triggers a continental rift thanks to his irrepressible search for acorns. Meanwhile, Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego the sabre-toothed cat find themselves on the run from pirate apes.Who’s it for?

TO DEBUT ENTIRE 2021 SLATE IN THEATERS AND ON HBO MAX SIMULTANEOUSLY(Photo by Chiabella James/©Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.)Just over a year ago, when Disney+ first launched on November 12, 2019, it may have seemed crazy that any streaming app could ever compete with Netflix, which has shows like The Crown, Stranger Things, and The Umbrella Company. That, of course, was before anyone had seen The Mandalorian, and before we knew much about Warner Bros.’ HBO Max app, the scope of which exploded with this week’s big news. Just two weeks after the revelation that Wonder Woman 1984 will debut on HBO Max on December 25, 2020 on the same day it premieres in theaters, Warner Bros. has announced that their entire theatrical slate for 2021 will also debut day-and-date simultaneously on the HBO Max app, at no additional cost (besides the monthly subscription rate), due to the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on movie theaters. We’re talking here about 17 movies, both big and small, including Mortal Kombat (1/15/2021), Tom and Jerry (3/5/2021), the Sopranos prequel The Many Saints of Newark (3/12/2021), Godzilla vs Kong (5/21/2021), The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (6/4/2021), Lin-Manuel Miranda’s In the Heights (6/18/2021), Space Jam: A New Legacy (7/16/2021), James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad (8/6/2021), Dune (10/1/2021), Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis (11/5/2021), and The Matrix 4 (12/22/2021), among others. Super unsurprisingly, HBO Max also ended their free trial promotion yesterday. This surprise announcement also came just a week after the news last week that Netflix had offered Warner Bros. $200 million for the streaming rights to Godzilla vs Kong&nbsp;alone. Warner Bros.’ announcement also left an immediate impact on movie theater exhibition stocks yesterday, the leaders of many of which had the expected negative-to-mixed reactions (the most negative of which came from AMC). You can see new logos for many of these films here, and the official announcement trailer right here. As for what this means for the future of the movie theater business past 2021, no one really knows, but Variety explored some of those questions here.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;MARGOT ROBBIE IN TALKS TO REPLACE EMMA STONE ON DAMIEN CHAZELLE’S&nbsp;BABYLON(Photo by Andrew Cooper/©Columbia Pictures)After reuniting with his La La Land star Ryan Gosling for the moon landing drama First Man (Certified Fresh at 87%), director Damien Chazelle has been planning on also reuniting with the former’s other star, Emma Stone, for Babylon, about Hollywood’s transitional period between silent films and the “talkies” of the 1920 and 1930s. In a surprise move this week, however, Stone has dropped out due to scheduling conflicts (it’s unclear what film the conflict is with), with Margot Robbie now in talks for the role, which is believed to be the original “It Girl,” silent star Clara Bow. If Robbie does sign on for Babylon, the movie will effectively become a reunion project for another film set in Hollywood’s past, Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood (Certifed Fresh at 85%), as the Babylon male lead is Brad Pitt. In related news, actress Li Jun Li (TV’s Quantico, The Exorcist) has also been cast as early Chinese American movie star Anna May Wong. Paramount Pictures has scheduled Babylon for an awards-qualifying limited release on Christmas Day, 2021, followed by a wide release on January 7, 2022.2. OSCAR ISAAC TO STAR IN&nbsp;METAL GEAR SOLID ADAPTATION(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/Netflix)Although his run as Poe Dameron in the final three Star Wars chapters is over, Oscar Isaac continues to stack up new franchises, which before this week’s news already included The Addams Family (in which he voices Gomez), the Dune remake (10/21/2021), and the MCU with his Disney+ role as Moon Knight. We can add to that list the long-in-development video game adaptation&nbsp;Metal Gear Solid, in which Isaac will star as franchise star and super spy Solid Snake. With over a dozen main franchise games published since the 1990s, Metal Gear Solid has the potential of being a multi-film franchise on par with Resident Evil. Metal Gear Solid has long been a dream project for director Jordan Vogt-Roberts (Kong: Skull Island, The Kings of Summer), who will be working off a screenplay by Derek Connolly (Safety Not Guaranteed; co-writer of Jurassic World). Other projects Oscar Isaac has in the works include the Ex Machina comic book adaptation The Great Machine and the Hollywood true story Francis and the Godfather.3. GAL GADOT MOVES FROM SUPERHERO TO SUPER SPY WITH HEART OF STONE(Photo by RCF/Everett Collection)As we get closer to the Christmas Day premiere of Wonder Woman 1984 on HBO Max and in theaters, Gal Gadot has found another lucrative genre to add to her filmography in addition to superheroes and (formerly) the racing action of the Fast &amp; Furious movies. Gadot has finalized a deal for upwards of $10 million with Skydance Media to star in the spy thriller Heart of Stone,which is being described as a potential franchise-starter in the style of James Bond and Mission: Impossible. Tom Harper, who directed Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones in the hot air balloon adventure The Aeronauts (Certified Fresh at 72%) is currently in talks to direct Heart of Stone from a screenplay by comic book writer Greg Rucka (Netflix’s The Old Guard, Certified Fresh at 81%) and screenwriter Allison Schroeder (co-writer of Hidden Figures, Christpher Robin). Other projects Gal Gadot has in the works include her starring role in Cleopatra&nbsp;and the Netflix action movie Red Notice, along with Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds.4.&nbsp;PETER DINKLAGE TO WIELD THE MIGHTY MOP OF&nbsp;THE TOXIC AVENGER(Photo by HBO)For years now, whenever fans speculate about the casting of a possible Alpha Flight movie, one of the inevitable picks is Peter Dinklage&nbsp;as Puck (because of their similarity in height). Instead, when Dinklage did actually make his debut in a Marvel Studios movie, it was in&nbsp;X-Men: Days of Future Past&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 90%) as the scientist Bolivar Trask, and that role was later followed by a turn as&nbsp;Eitri, King of the Dwarves, in Avengers: Infinity War (Certified Fresh at 85%). As it turns out, however, Dinklage’s first true superhero role will be one with indie filmmaking roots&nbsp;far outside the Marvel Cinematic Universe: in the remake of Troma’s The Toxic Avenger (Fresh at 70%). Troma’s Lloyd Kaufman is co-producing the reboot for Legendary Pictures, the same production company that gave us Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy and Warner Bros’ current Godzilla franchise. Dinklage’s reboot of The Toxic Avenger will reportedly “subvert” the superhero genre in the style of Marvel’s Deadpool, which makes sense when you find out that it will be directed by actor Macon Blair (Blue Ruin), who made his directorial debut with I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore (Certified Fresh at 89%).5. HARRIET STAR CYNTHIA ERIVO TAKES ON ANOTHER 19TH CENTURY BIOPIC(Photo by Eli Winston/Everett Collection)Broadway star Cynthia Erivo was one of last year’s Best Actress nominees for her role as Harriet Tubman in Harriet (Fresh at 74%), and now she’s found another biopic set in the 19th century, as she is attached to produce and star in an untitled film about the life of African princess Omoba Aina (A.K.A. Sara Forbes Bonetta), who was enslaved and then eventually became the goddaughter of Queen Victoria of England. The film will be partly adapted from the biographical book At Her Majesty’s Request. Benedict Cumberbatch will also be one of the project’s producers, but it’s not yet known if he will also take on one of the film’s historical roles.6. RON HOWARD’S THAI CAVE RESCUE DRAMA THIRTEEN LIVES TO START FILMING SOON(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/©Universal Pictures)Just a couple of weeks after the Netflix premiere of his latest film as director, Hillbilly Elegy (Rotten at 25%), Ron Howard is already getting ready for his next film as director. That movie will be Thirteen Lives, about the cave rescue effort in Thailand in 2018, which will start filming in Australia in March, 2021. Howard’s Thirteen Lives now also stands out as the possible winner in a race to get a major movie about the&nbsp;incident produced after a surprising six different projects were confirmed to be in development within a few months of the disaster. Thirteen Lives will be a joint production between Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment and MGM. No casting has been announced yet.7. UNIVERSAL’S MONSTER MOVIES REBOOTS WILL INCLUDE VAN HELSING(Photo by (c)Universal courtesy Everett Collection)Universal’s attempts to move on from the&nbsp;Dark Universe idea got rolling in style earlier this year with The Invisible Man&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 91%), and they continue to develop films based on their classic monster lineup almost more intensely than they did before.&nbsp;The 2004 Hugh Jackman action movie Van Helsing (Rotten at 24%) was a famous misfire, but the vampire-hunting Dracula character himself appears to still have fans at Universal, because the studio is moving forward with plans for a Van Helsing reboot. Universal Pictures is teaming up with producer James Wan (Aquaman, The Conjuring) for a new Van Helsing film to be directed by Julius Avery, who in 2018 gave us the Nazi zombie movie Overlord (Certified Fresh at 81%). It’s not yet known what sort of tone the new Van Helsing will take, or whether it will directly connect to other Universal monster movies (either before or after Van Helsing). Julius Avery will also be rewriting a pre-existing Van Helsing reboot screenplay draft written by screenwriter Eric Pearson (Marvel’s Black Widow; co-writer of Thor: Ragnarok).8. THIS WEEK IN JASON STATHAM: EASTERN PROMISES SPIN-OFF, MOVIE WITH AUBREY PLAZA(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Every once in a while, an actor will be lucky enough to have two new movies announced in the same week. This week, it’s Jason Statham, and neither movie is a sequel to any of his recent hits like The Meg or Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw, but one of them was almost a sequel. Jason Statham is in advanced talks to star in the Russian crime thriller Small Dark Look, which was originally developed as a sequel to the Viggo Mortensen drama Eastern Promises (Certified Fresh at 89%). It sounds, however, like elements of the movie have been changed (notably, probably changing the character from the one played by Viggo Mortensen), so that it’s no longer a sequel. The other Jason Statham movie to make the news this week is an untitled thriller to be directed by Guy Ritchie, whose first two features, 1998’s&nbsp;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (Certified Fresh at 75%) and 2001’s&nbsp;Snatch (Fresh at 73%), helped launch Statham’s movie career. The new project, which was previously titled Five Eyes, will team Statham up with Parks &amp; Recreation star Aubrey Plaza as an&nbsp;international super spy who must work with a high-tech CIA expert on a “globe-trotting mission to infiltrate a billionaire arms broker.” This project appears to be one that Ritchie is taking on while others, including Disney’s live-action sequel to 2019’s&nbsp;Aladdin (Rotten at 57%), continue to be developed.On an Apple device?

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

For the third year in a row, the retro sci-fi series dominated the top spot across all age groups and gender demographics as Rotten Tomatoes users’ favorite Netflix original series. A massive 48 percent of respondents —&nbsp;44 percent of women and 52 percent of men — named the Spielberg-inspired ’80s-set drama their favorite original Netflix show.But there are two new entries in the top 5: comic book drama The Umbrella Academy at No. 2, and novel adaptation&nbsp;The Witcher at No. 4.&nbsp;Marvel’s Daredevil&nbsp;makes the top 5 yet again (dropping down a spot to No. 2),&nbsp;with&nbsp;moody drama Ozark&nbsp;coming in at No. 5 (replacing last year’s moody No. 3 drama, Mindhunter).While men and women alike are mega-fans of Stranger Things, the next-most-popular show among women was The Umbrella Academy, and among the men it was Daredevil. Younger folks tended to go for the genre-friendly series (superheroes, sci-fi, etc.), while the 55 and up demo prefer more down-to-earth series (Ozark, The Crown,&nbsp;Grace and Frankie).Some big titles that made the list last year — The OA, Big Mouth, Peaky Blinders, Making a Murderer, Iron Fist, A Series of Unfortunate Events — didn’t make it in 2020, leaving room for newcomers like The Haunting of Hill House, Sex Education, Dead to Me, and more.We allowed survey participants to vote for multiple titles — read on to find out which came out on top overall.BoJack Horseman (2014) 93%#30Synopsis: Will Arnett voices BoJack, the failed legendary 90's sitcom star from the favorite family sitcom Horsin?

They are listed below alphabetically by TV title.Some you know: The third and fourth seasons of AMC’s Breaking Bad — “I am the one who knocks” — starring&nbsp;Bryan Cranston as one of TV’s iconic male antiheroes, Walter White. See also on this list: Mad Men’s Don Draper and Sons of Anarchy’s&nbsp;Jax Teller.Others may come as a surprise, like the stellar performance of Master of None, about an Indian-American man living and dating in New York City, that debuted on Netflix in 2015. The series tackles creator Aziz Ansari’s experience as a first-generation American and millennial trying to find love.Master of None&nbsp;belongs to&nbsp;a select group of shows with more than one season on the list: The series’ second season is also in the 100% club;&nbsp;all three&nbsp;Big Mouth&nbsp;seasons and&nbsp;Counterpart‘s two are on the list; Amazon Prime Video’s Catastrophe&nbsp;and FX’s Justified&nbsp;scored three spots each; and Broad City&nbsp;has the most with&nbsp;four of its five seasons on our shortlist. Other recent series with multiple seasons in the 100% club: The Good Place, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,&nbsp;One Day at a Time, Veep,&nbsp;Fleabag,&nbsp;and Jane the Virgin.Fleabag season 2 overtook Master of None season 1 with the most reviews on its 100% score.&nbsp;Season&nbsp;2 has its perfect score on the collective opinions of&nbsp;95 critics, putting it ahead of all other 100% seasons — the more critics’ opinions weighed, the more valuable that perfect score is.Lastly, while several 100% seasons might have enough reviews to be included on this list (for example, season 4 of&nbsp;sci-fi fan-favorite&nbsp;The Expanse and&nbsp;seasons 5 of Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), they don’t meet all of the Certified Fresh eligibility requirements&nbsp;— yet. We’ll keep watching them.Update: Peacock comedy Girls5Eva&nbsp;falls off the list, while Peacock import We Are Lady Parts, Apple TV+ docuseries 1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything, and the third and final season of FX’s PoseWhich is&nbsp;your favorite 100%&nbsp; Certified Fresh season of TV?

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

CR: John P. Fleenor/FOX)\nDC Comics TV by Tomatometer\nUpdated August 24, 2020\nThough DC Comics has enjoyed a television presence since 1953 with the George Reeves–starring Adventures of Superman — and made genuine cultural touchstones out of the 1966&nbsp;Batman and the late 1970s&nbsp;Wonder Woman — it has never had so many of its titles translated on television at the same time before.\nWith the launch of streaming service DC Universe, three titles&nbsp;were added to the list: Titans, the live-action adaptation of the comic of the same name starring Brenton Thwaites as Dick Grayson (a.k.a. Robin);&nbsp;Doom Patrol, about a misfit group of superheroes under the tutelage of an eccentric old rich guy; and Swamp Thing, the live-action horror-skewing series, which was canceled before its well-reviewed first season finished airing, but is now on The CW’s fall TV lineup. The animated series&nbsp;Young Justice, which debuted its first season in 2010 and second in 2012, returned for a third season in 2019 with a fourth expected in 2020, and now DC Universe and The CW have premiered live-action series Stargirl, which shot straight to the top of DC’s TV offerings on its first reviews, settling in the top 20.\nWant to know where each show stands&nbsp;in the DC-on-TV rankings? Check out our scorecard of&nbsp;DC Comics–based television by Tomatometer. Some titles — like 1990’s Swamp Thing,&nbsp;Super Friends, and&nbsp;Teen Titans Go! — don’t have a series-level Tomatometer score and, so, are not represented below. Some other, older titles, like 1976 series Wonder Woman, recently got a series-level score and have just been added to the list.\nJust added:&nbsp; Stargirl, Harley Quinn,&nbsp;Watchmen,&nbsp;Batwoman,&nbsp;Pennyworth,&nbsp;Green Lantern: The Animated Series,&nbsp;Justice League Unlimited,&nbsp;&nbsp;Batman Beyond,&nbsp;The Flash (1990), Human Target (1992), Wonder Woman\n\n        \n            \n              \n                  \n              \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                          Human Target (0)  20%\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        #36\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        Synopsis: Christopher Chance is a Vietnam vet who works as a target-for-hire, impersonating threatened people in order to save their lives....

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

They also understand pop stardom from the inside out. As longtime ringers for — and consistently the best part of —&nbsp;Saturday Night Live, they observed and worked alongside some of the biggest celebrities and pop stars of their day. I’m talking your T-Pains, your Timberlakes, your Boltons. When they&nbsp;wanted to make a song called&nbsp;“I Just Had Sex” that sounded like something by Akon but expressed an oblivious dork’s unself-conscious jubilation over sexual intercourse, they were able to get&nbsp;Akon himself to sing the hook on it.So when it came time for The Lonely Island to make their first movie, 2016’s Judd Apatow-produced Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, pop stardom was a natural target. More specifically, the film took on Justin Bieber, the angel-voiced Canadian man-child who has alternately seduced, appalled, and enraged a spellbound and apoplectic public with his drug- and arrogance-fueled shenanigans en route to being one of the most loved and hated men in the world.Popstar’s satirical take on Bieber is Andy Samberg as Conner “Conner4Real” Friel, the pretty-boy breakout star of Style Boyz, a genre-hopping boy band that paired him with childhood friends Lawrence “Kid Brain” Dunn (Akiva Schaffer), a moody, resentful wordsmith, and Owen “Kid Contact” Bouchard (Jorma Taccone), the sunny, affable peacemaker and beat smith of the group.When Style Boyz break up due to Conner’s selfishness, Owen swallows his relatively modest ego to DJ for his former bandmate, even when that means rocking a Daft Punk-style EDM light-show&nbsp; helmet that makes him look like an ecstasy-fueled Day-Glo Man in the Iron Mask and emits a noise and light akin to some Lovecraftian monster’s belch of the damned.(Photo by Universal)Conner4Real&nbsp;behaves like an insanely entitled doofus, blundering across the globe as the quintessential ugly American.As a dead-on parody of Justin Bieber, Conner4Real&nbsp;behaves like an insanely entitled doofus, blundering across the globe as the quintessential ugly American. He insults whole countries with his short-attention-span boorishness and&nbsp;inadvertently does everything conceivable&nbsp;to transform the public’s feverish, outsized love for him into seething hatred.But because Conner is played by Andy Samberg, he has a sweetness and a vulnerability that belies the character’s purposeful obnoxiousness and makes him far more sympathetic and appealing than he really has any right to be. It also helps&nbsp;that Conner isn’t&nbsp;on top for long — he spends most of the film in&nbsp;a steep downward spiral after the gimmick-riddled release of his sophomore album (a follow-up to his debut, Thriller, Also) tanks his promotional tour and his career in short order. Nothing humbles and humanizes a narcissistic egomaniac quite like failure, and Conner’s long slide downhill offers&nbsp;a deep, rich sense of Schadenfreude not unlike similar reactions to&nbsp;the ongoing public humiliations of the real Bieber.Outside of Conner, Popstar has the enviable problem of juggling too many great supporting characters and subplots to do justice to any of them, like a tragicomic (but mostly just tragic) subplot involving Conner’s party-hearty and spiritually lost mother, who is played by Joan Cusack with that distinctively Joan Cusackian sense of adorable heartbreak. The wonderful Tim Meadows, who seems to be getting better as he gets older, also makes an indelible impression as Conner’s manager, a world-weary show business survivor who never quite got over&nbsp;getting kicked out of Tony Toni Tone! back in the day. In a big, broad comedy with big, broad laughs, Meadows comes close to stealing the film with his understated delivery and the strangely affecting sense of pathos he brings to the role.In the theatrical version of&nbsp;Popstar, Sarah Silverman is predictably under-utilized&nbsp;as Conner’s no-nonsense publicist, the only person in his life (other than Lawrence, who isn’t really in his life) who tells him the unvarnished truth, which Conner interprets as a never-ending sarcastic goof. Yet her character — and many others — are rounded out in the deleted scenes found on the film’s essential DVD. Separately and collectively, these deleted scenes would have made the 84-minute comedy&nbsp;funnier and deeper on an emotional level, but it’s hard to begrudge a movie with so little fat and so much funny.The embarrassment of riches extends to its use of music. Popstar gallops along at such a pace that we only get to hear little snippets of the brilliant, funny, and weird songs delivered via elaborate production numbers. I’m speaking of tunes&nbsp;like “Mona Lisa”, which is at once a much-needed response to Da Vinci-extolling numbers by the likes of Nat King Cole and a devastating lampoon of Americans who travel the world expecting it to be as endlessly and easily stimulating and familiar as their Facebook or Twitter feeds. And, let’s face it, to 21st century eyes, Mona Lisa ain’t exactly Scarlett Johannson. It’s about time a truth-teller like Conner dispelled the poisonous myth of her&nbsp;attractiveness.(Photo by Universal)Popstar&nbsp;imbues a totally absurd reality with a genuine emotional core.Popstar&nbsp;offers the perfect balance of Apatowian raunch and heart, particularly evident in&nbsp;a scene where Conner and Lawrence have an animated disagreement while a fan’s naked penis angrily fights for attention in the background of the frame. Both sides of that equation — the heated and emotionally authentic argument between two people who once loved each other and the nude male genitalia demanding and receiving the audience’s attention — are quintessential Lonely Island and help define the film’s weird balance of unexpectedly deep emotion and expectedly frequent dick jokes.Perhaps also due to Apatow’s influence,&nbsp;Popstar&nbsp;has a warm breathing heart and emotional core, while previous Lonely Island productions like&nbsp;Hot Rod&nbsp;mocked the very conceit that human beings might feel anything for one another. The further Conner plummets from his place high atop the socio-economic and show business ladder, the more he’s drawn back into the orbit of his old bandmates, particularly after Owen “parent traps” Conner and Lawrence, tricking them into a reluctant reunion.Popstar‘s genuine emotional core&nbsp;comes from the decades the leads have spent working together. Its dynamic echoes that of The Lonely Island itself — they’re all huge talents and multi-hyphenates (while Samberg is the lead, the other members co-directed, and all three co-wrote the script), but Samberg is undoubtedly the star, the frontman, the Justin Timberlake of its N’Sync. You can feel the dense, complicated, bittersweet tapestry of resentment and appreciation, nostalgia and zealously held grudges, love and visceral, long-simmering hate that exists between artists who’ve worked intimately with each other for decades and carry that baggage into every emotionally loaded interaction.Part of what makes The Lonely Island such a delight is its sneakily sincere appreciation of pop song craft and the dizzy, ephemeral pleasures of the pop world. Popstar may be cynical about the fickle nature of pop stardom and the parasites who flock to big, dumb sheep like Conner, but it’s also clued in to the joy that pop music can bring, even if it’s from an overgrown child like Justin Bieber or Conner4Real.This is most evident in a climactic reunion performance featuring cameos from Usher, Michael Bolton, and frequent collaborator Justin Timberlake (who has a small but fun role as Conner’s adoring personal chef) that, like the climax of Walk Hard, is both a ridiculous and inspired parody of rock and roll pretentiousness and epic self-delusion, and a catchy, infectious, and memorable anthem that’s weirdly beautiful despite its ridiculousness.That isn’t the film’s only resemblance to Walk Hard, though. Like Dewey Cox, Conner4Real is such a funny and appealing character from such a perfectly cast actor, singer, and songwriter that he almost threatens to transcend the cultural context and become sort of a bizzaro-world pop star in his own right, like Spinal Tap, which released a number of albums that had nothing to do with the movie that made them cult stars.(Photo by Glen Wilson/Universal)It gets us to root for Conner, to feel for Conner, to believe in his fundamental goodness.Still, Popstar gets us to laugh at Conner4Real. That’s no small feat, given how difficult it is for mainstream comedies to be funny at all, let alone this consistently hilarious. More impressively, it gets us to root for Conner, to feel for Conner, to believe in his fundamental goodness and capacity for emotional growth and redemption.That Popstar works emotionally as well as comedically may be a testament to the Apatow touch, or it may be a lucky byproduct of the movie being made by three people who are friends and life partners, not just people thrown together by a casting director and asked to fake a lifetime of camaraderie and simmering resentments.That was true of Spinal Tap as well. It too was the work of musician funny-men (not the most common or most respected breed) who had been performing, writing, and playing together for decades, sometimes, appropriately enough, during their stints on Saturday Night Live, although heaven knows their runs&nbsp;on&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;were not career highlights for Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest, and Michael McKean.The same cannot be said of The Lonely Island, who made the most out of their time on Lorne Michaels’ eternally uneven and maligned sketch comedy show as its&nbsp;digital filmmakers. They wrote an unlikely seaboard anthem in “I’m On A Boat” and were honored with a Grammy nomination and the undying affection of the cruise industry for their work. More importantly, they perfected their craft alongside the very pop stars whose essence they were gleefully lampooning.The commercial under-performance of Popstar is disappointing but ultimately not terribly surprising. After all, This Is Spinal Tap, UHF, and Walk Hard didn’t exactly set box-offices aflame either, but while more successful movies have subsequently been forgotten, their cults only continue to expand. That’s not bad company to share. Though Popstar is about the biggest kind of mainstream pop star, it always seemed both blessed and cursed to live and die — and then live on again — forever as a cult movie.Original Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;77 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

Truth, beauty, justice; these are all fine and dandy. But for the hardcore denizens of the internet — the snarky, smartass souls who spend their days quipping wise on Twitter, contributing to Facebook groups, and surfing various pop culture websites — such admirable, old-fashioned qualities can’t begin to measure up to the zeitgeist-capturing awesomeness of the space raccoon that wears people clothes in Guardians Of The Galaxy or the Merc with the mouth currently hypnotizing the masses.The cult of the internet is in many ways a cult of awesomeness, and about a decade ago, its denizens were overjoyed (hell, let’s use the appropriate terminology: they were super mega geeked) to stumble across a film title, star, and premise that promised to result in the single most awesome movie ever made. Note that I did not say the best movie or the funniest or, god forbid, the smartest.On the contrary, the movie was one that couldn’t — and shouldn’t, and wouldn’t — be anything approaching good. Hell, the internet didn’t want this movie to be good. They wanted it to be awesomely bad, hilariously incompetent. They wanted it to be “so bad it’s good.”The film that I am talking about is, of course, 2006’s Snakes On A Plane, a silly little trifle elevated to the level of a bona fide pop culture phenomenon before the non-internet world — the one that, to its credit, doesn’t care what insanity Jaden Smith is tweeting because they have more important things to worry about — knocked it back down to size.Snakes On A Plane’s road to over-hyped notoriety kicked into high gear when, according to popular lore, Samuel L. Jackson agreed to sign onto a movie called Snakes On A Plane, to be directed by Hong Kong veteran Ronny Yu (who was eventually replaced), without needing to look at a screenplay. Why would he need to? If this awesome dude thought the title Snakes On A Plane was awesome enough for him to sign on, sight unseen, who were we to suggest that maybe this movie maybe wouldn’t be transcendently, awesomely&nbsp;bad, but merely sub-par?The filmmakers re-shot scenes in a desperate attempt to give its instant cult more of what they thought it wanted.As the media frenzy grew, cannibalizing itself in its delirious abandon, the public angrily demanded that this cheesy vessel for their fantasies feature all of the things they craved, namely boobs, drugs,&nbsp;and Samuel L. Jackson, that peerless poet of punchy profanity, loudly and climactically demanding, “Enough is Enough! I have had it with these motherf—ing snakes on this motherf—ing plane.” Oh, I’m sorry. What they actually demanded was Jackson yelling, “ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!! I’VE HAD IT WITH THESE MOTHERF—ING SNAKES ON THIS MOTHERF—ING PLANE!!!”It was like the old “Magic Word” on You Bet Your Life, only this time, the internet was promising that if Jackson would simply scream those words at the top of his lungs, then they would give the studio behind this surefire masterpiece all of the money. Not just all of their money, mind you, but all the money in the world. And if Snakes On A Plane did make&nbsp;all the money in the world, it would be considered a distinct commercial success. To that end, the filmmakers re-shot scenes in a desperate attempt to give its instant cult more of what they thought it wanted, and bumped up the rating from a weak and compromised PG-13 to a hard R in the process.It did not go down the way the internet imagined it would, however, and the movie, which&nbsp;promised to make far more money and reach a vastly larger audience than anyone dreamed possible, ended up being, of all things, a distinct commercial disappointment. Considering the film’s modest budget, it wasn’t quite a flop, but it’s hard to see it as anything but the most compromised kind of success.The internet loved the idea of Snakes On A Plane, but it was a lot less gung-ho about the reality of it, and non-Internet people who wondered what the fuss was about stayed away. Like the similarly hyped, similarly underwhelming Fanboys, Snakes On A Plane was an enormous cult movie whose cult seemed to have mysteriously disappeared as soon as the film was released and proven eminently unworthy of their frothing, misplaced passion and belief.Jackson’s enthusiasm helped make Snakes On A Plane a thing, but he fails to make his protagonist, FBI agent Neville Flynn, anything more than than the shouty guy with a gun he plays in most of his more forgettable films. In Snakes On A Plane, Flynn offers to protect simian-featured extreme sports enthusiast Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) if he’ll travel from his Hawaii home to Los Angeles to testify against martial arts-adept bad guy Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson) after the earnest, charisma-impaired young man witnesses the crime boss killing an enemy.The veteran FBI agent plans to take up all of first class on the flight transporting his precious cargo, but his plans go extravagantly awry when Kim decides to smuggle pheromone-crazed snakes onto the plane in hopes that they’ll bring it down. Kim only wants to get rid of a single witness, but he has no problem killing a whole bunch of innocent bystanders in the process.&nbsp;He is not a very nice man.Snakes On A Plane was released around a decade ago, but all of its characters seem to have emerged from the schlocky genre cinema of the 1970s and 1980s. The film is a lazy pastiche of tropes beloved by shameless action filmmakers of the Carter and Reagan eras, particularly the lovable creeps over at the Cannon crap factory. The film gingerly combines martial arts (the bad guys), soft-core porn (the couple that boards the plane solely to have sex, only to be killed by snakes), campy comedy, and campier horror.The internet loved the idea of Snakes On A Plane, but it was a lot less gung-ho about the reality of it.It’s&nbsp;an action-comedy, but more than anything, it’s a disaster movie about a coterie of broadly drawn types who are faced with a crisis beyond most folk’s vivid imaginations and expected to&nbsp;figure out a way to band together for the sake of survival. In the grand tradition of disaster movies, these supporting characters don’t even need to open their mouths for us to know everything about them.All it takes is one look at Mercedes (Rachel Blanchard), a lanky beauty with a chihuahua in her purse, to know that she’s a snobby child of privilege who enjoys the finer things in life, just as a single gander at “Three Gs” (Flex Alexander), a well-dressed black man surrounded by chunky flunkies, tells us&nbsp;he’s an arrogant celebrity who’s full of himself and more than a little obnoxious.Snakes On A Plane doesn’t deliberately choose to be bad so much as it luxuriates in the freedom the world has given it to not be good. Even the talented actors on display here sink to the level of the material, like Julianna Margulies, who makes zero impression as Claire Miller, a flight attendant on her last trip before leaving the stewardess trade for good. Thank God the filmmakers establish that Claire is experiencing a personal and professional milestone, or the only notable thing that would have happened on her final flight would be all those snakes popping out of nowhere and killing people.Snakes are the film’s reason for existing, but like everything in Snakes On A Plane, they’re more fun in theory than in practice. The idea is a kitschy, goofball delight, but as villains, snakes are&nbsp;pretty limited and one-dimensional; they basically have one move, which is to jump out and kill people. The CGI-intensive special effects here are unconvincing enough to kill any suspense but not unconvincing enough to be funny or fun.Once onboard, Snakes On A Plane wastes little time pandering to the drunken whims of the audience. A couple goes to the bathroom to have sex and smoke weed and are murdered by reptiles for their troubles. Shortly afterwards, a man trying to urinate is rudely interrupted by a snake that attaches itself to his penis and refuses to let go. In shock and horror the unfortunate victim&nbsp;yells, “F—ing d—, get off my d—!” to the cursed reptile.Now, a man moaning “F—ing d—, get off my d—!” while bleeding to death from a reptile feasting on his penis may engender guilty chuckles, but Snakes On A Plane is frustratingly light on guilty chuckles, which is the whole point of instant camp like this.I was thoroughly underwhelmed by the film&nbsp;when I saw it by myself at a 10 o’clock screening the Friday it came out. I felt a bit like an enemy of fun, being so thoroughly non-entertained by such a frenzied juggernaut of trash-culture fantasy fulfillment. I suspect part of my response was attributable to seeing it in less than ideal circumstances (stone cold sober, in the morning, and with a critical eye), but I was also probably responding, on some level, to the hype.I’ve made bad movie appreciation the cornerstone of my life and career, so re-contextualizing Hollywood product in fun and subversive ways is something&nbsp;I’ve devoted a lot of thought and energy to. I was irritated that the studio tried&nbsp;to create a pre-fabricated “so bad it’s good” cult classic, rather than letting a cult come to the movie organically. I was both relieved and a little chagrined that Snakes On A Plane left me just as cold a full decade later in a much different context.Snakes On A Plane knows that it’s stupid and silly, but that’s the extent of its self-awareness.The ultimate problem with Snakes On A Plane is that it has no real take on the material, no point of view. Bad movies generally become cult classics one of two ways. They’re either the product of gloriously misplaced passion, personality, and sincerity, like The Room, Fateful Findings, or Glen &amp; Glenda, or they realize their fundamentally tawdry and sleazy nature and have fun with their shortcomings.Snakes On A Plane knows that it’s stupid and silly, but that’s the extent of its self-awareness; it gives audiences what it thinks they want to such a tedious degree that it ends up feeling less like the kind of cult favorite that inspires fan fiction than actual fan-fiction itself.It’s as if the internet were “playing” Snakes On A Plane like a kid playing a video game. The masses were making the movie’s characters do and say what they wanted, but all they were really doing was hitting the “Be More Awesome!” button until it stopped working. Movies made by committee seldom work when that committee consists of unseen armies of executives, script doctors, editors, and focus group respondents all working to create something that reflects less the strong, uncompromised voice of a single auteur than the half-assed contributions of a far-flung aggregation of people doing the best they can. But movies made by committee work just as poorly when the “committee” in question is the internet.In a sense, it all comes down to the scene where Jackson fulfills his cornball destiny and yells that instantly famous catchphrase about the mother-bleeping snakes on the mother-bleeping plane. It’s the film’s ultimate moment of truth: an actor who embodies awesomeness is yelling the awesome line the Internet has lovingly forced on him in an awesomely titled movie with an insanely awesome premise, and the result is, alas, decidedly less than awesome. The whole phenomenon is leading up to this moment, and it rings utterly hollow. It turns out that “awesomeness” is a pretty thin conceit, shallow, juvenile, and empty. Huge portions of the internet may be built upon a middle school concept of “awesomeness,” but it’s not even enough to sustain a single silly b-movie.Snakes On A Plane was supposed to illustrate the strength of the internet. Its success was supposed to be a testament to the web’s ability to whip up a hurricane of hype and press and transform a glorified b-movie into a fluke blockbuster. Instead, its failure illustrated the limitations of the internet’s awesomeness brigade, as well as “awesomeness” as both a conceit and a state of mind.Original Certification:&nbsp;RottenTomatometer:&nbsp;69 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;RottenNathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

Like the strangely simpatico world of Stephen King, another populist commercial giant of the era (and today, and forever), it was a realm at once cozily familiar and beguilingly fantastical. It was a place where kids did kid stuff to pass the time like riding bikes and hanging out and telling stories.Yet, it was also&nbsp;a world where creepily cute extra terrestrials got stranded on earth and longed for telephonic communication with their home planet, and cuddly little creatures of unknown origin morphed into feral, destructive monsters when the rules for their care were violated. Steven Spielberg ruled the Reagan years as a director and&nbsp;as a producer whose stewardship of classics like Gremlins, Poltergeist, and Back To The Future helped generations of wide-eyed kids fall in love with the movies.1989’s The ‘Burbs is not technically a Steven Spielberg movie, but it felt like one. It was directed by Joe Dante, one of Spielberg’s most accomplished proteges, and starred the actor who would become Spielberg’s favorite leading man, Tom Hanks.Dante, a movie- and pop culture-crazed alumnus of the Roger Corman school of fast, cheap, and salacious cinema, first ventured into the blood-soaked waters of his future mentor by directing Piranha, an overachieving Jaws knock-off/spoof/homage/pastiche. A young Dante was reportedly rewarded for his sly, subversively satirical work with a chance to direct an actual&nbsp;Jaws parody written by a young John Hughes to be called Jaws 3, People 0, but that never came to fruition. Dante did, however, collaborate with Spielberg on Twilight Zone: The Movie and then Gremlins and Gremlins 2: The New Batch, in addition to several other projects.Dante’s suburbia was like Spielberg’s, but darker and more subversive. If Spielberg was the warm and fuzzy Mogwai Gizmo, then Dante was Spike, a twisted mutation wreaking merry comic havoc. The ‘Burbs is one of the few Dante projects of&nbsp;its time that Spielberg did not have a hand in, but like Gremlins, the film begs to be read as a meditation on Spielberg’s aesthetic, at once loving and bracingly dark.Dante’s suburbia was like Spielberg’s, but darker and more subversive.The film stars a perfectly cast Tom Hanks as everyman Ray Peterson, a regular guy who decides to spend his vacation not doing much of anything at all. Rather than force himself to travel somewhere and pretend to have fun, Ray decides to embark on the original “staycation” and spend a carefree week at home.If Dante and Spielberg and Back To The Future director/fellow Spielberg protege Robert Zemeckis’ neighborhoods are worlds unto themselves, then the cul-de-sac where Ray and his neighbors live and scheme is a world within a world within a world. Beloved Dante repertory player Dick Miller sums up this strange corner of suburbia when he complains to a fellow garbageman played by Dante regular Robert Picardo, “I hate cul-de-sacs. There’s only one way out and the people are kind of weird.”“Kind of weird” is understating it, although Ray and his soon-to-be partners in mischief think of themselves as not only perfectly normal, but the gold standard for all-American normality, a bunch of straight white guys who like drinking beer and watering their lawn and gossiping about their neighbors.Ray isn’t surrounded by men so much as he’s surrounded by guys, who are like men, but without the maturity or dignity. Party monster Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman) at least has youth to excuse his juvenile behavior. Feldman doesn’t have much range, but like Corey Haim, he can be great in the right role. Here, he’s&nbsp;perfectly convincing as a seemingly stoned space cadet (let’s just say there’s a good reason his character wears sunglasses much of the time) who regards his neighborhood as an open-ended theater full of kooky, larger-than-life characters pursuing their own weird plot lines and curious obsessions. He’s a cheerful viewer who is slightly ahead of the curve in embracing reality as a more appealing form of television, one he can watch with the same breezy, detached distance. He’s both a character in the action and an outside observer drinking it all in as a crazy spectacle.Bruce Dern delivers one of his funniest performances as Mark, an old military man angling for an excuse — any excuse — to go to war again, or at least embark on a secret, important mission. Rick Ducommun, a well-liked comedian and character actor whose film career never quite took off the way it should have after&nbsp;the great work he did here and in Groundhog Day, joins the bro brigade as Art, a guy who gives in to his worst instincts after his wife leaves town for a vacation, leaving him without adult supervision.A bored Ray, Mark, and Art find an unfortunate target for their restless energies when they begin to suspect that something dark and sinister is happening within the walls&nbsp;of the house owned by the mysterious Klopek family after another one of their neighbors, an effete older gentleman with a fancy little dog, goes missing. When strange things begin to happen&nbsp;at the Klopek house following the disappearance, Ray suddenly finds some much-needed direction for his week off.Bruce Dern delivers one of his funniest performances as Mark, an old military man angling for an excuse — any excuse — to go to war again.The Klopeks are conspicuous in their unfriendliness, but they are also conspicuous in their otherness, in their complete disinterest in assimilating or conforming in any way. And that, as much as their creepiness, renders them figures of suspicion to these all-American xenophobes.The beloved Carrie Fisher co-stars as Ray’s wife Carol, the film’s voice of reason and resident grownup. Her role is&nbsp;small but crucial, since The ‘Burbs is a film about what happens when we let our crazy-eyed inner child overrule our inner adult. While Ray, Mark, and Art appoint themselves a makeshift trio of gumshoes devoted to uncovering the potentially murderous mystery of the Klopek house, Carol very&nbsp;reasonably suggests that they simply invite themselves over to the Klopeks’ in an act of neighborly solidarity that doubles as a reconnaissance mission into enemy territory.The ensuing set-piece is a sustained masterpiece of the comedy of awkwardness and discomfort. Dante and screenwriter Dana Olsen (who also has a cameo as a cop) strike the perfect balance here by making both the Klopeks and the neighbors who suspect them of ultimate evil deeply suspicious and more than a little off.Hans Klopek (Courtney Gains), the first of the brood they encounter, is the European version of a Faulknerian idiot man-child. He’s all hulking innocence and brute force, but creepy and unnerving all the same. His Uncle Reuben (Brother Theodore) is even more creepy, but in a strikingly different way. Where Hans is an overgrown boy, Uncle Reuben is an angry, bitter, sharp-tongued old man who makes it apparent that the reason the Klopeks have not been neighborly is because they have no small amount of contempt for the American yahoos they’re cursed with having as neighbors.But even Uncle Reuben isn’t as disturbing as Dr. Werner Klopek (Henry Gibson), who is a doctor in the same way that Joseph Mengele was a doctor. Or maybe he’s just a weird old dude whose exotic customs and curious bearing make him seem more dangerous than he actually is.Do the neighbors suspect the Klopeks because the Klopeks are genuinely guilty of crimes ranging from murder to Satanic sacrifice, or do they suspect them because they are mysterious immigrants who do not desperately seek their approval and validation in the way we angrily demand immigrants do?For much of its duration, it feels like The ‘Burbs will be a darkly comic meditation on both Spielberg’s suburbia of the 1980s and the classic Twilight Zone episode “Monsters Are Due On Maple Street.” The endlessly cited standout episode of Rod Serling’s spooky science-fiction anthology chronicled how fear, suspicion, and paranoia — as well as some unexplained phenomena — can cause seemingly sane people to devolve into the monsters they decry. Ray even echoes the sentiment&nbsp;toward the end of the film, after one final investigation goes awry and leads to the&nbsp;Klopeks’ house blowing up. He&nbsp;emerges from the debris, receives treatment for his wounds, and&nbsp;shouts a memorable monologue about how he and his pals&nbsp;were the monsters all along, not the strangers, whose only real crime was that they were&nbsp;different.The ‘Burbs is a film about what happens when we let our crazy-eyed inner child overrule our inner adult.In “Monsters Are Due On Maple Street,” the paranoid atmosphere comes as a result of unexplained power outages, and it’s worth noting that the episode ultimately reveals the outages were, in fact, caused by space aliens intent on world domination. Similarly in The ‘Burbs,&nbsp;Werner Klopek does&nbsp;turn out to be the murderer Ray and his partners suspected, but it’s a testament to the film’s moral ambiguity and metaphorical richness that it almost doesn’t matter. In a very real way, Ray and his partners did devolve into monsters. They overstepped their boundaries, terrorized people based on flimsy evidence, and blew up a house based on a vague hunch that something evil was happening there.The ‘Burbs and “Monsters Are Due On Maple Street” are both compelling allegories about the way paranoia poisons us and reduces us to beasts scrapping desperately for survival. Yet, from a commercial standpoint (and Spielberg’s 1980s suburban reveries are nothing if not canny commercial entities), it makes sense to end a movie about people terrified of monsters in their midst with an actual monster. The ‘Burbs is able to have it both ways. It manages to Trojan-horse an awful lot of cynicism, satire, and social commentary into a solidly funny mainstream studio comedy, but it also delivers a horror movie payoff.In a way, it’s perfect that The ‘Burbs hit theaters and was a modest commercial success during the final year of the eighties. It’s at once deeply rooted in a very specific time and place and cultural context, yet strangely timeless. As long as we fear our neighbors and act on that fear, rather than attempt to communicate with and understand those who are different from us, The ‘Burbs will be depressingly relevant. The film takes place entirely on one block, in one cul-de-sac, but as the giant fade-in and fade-out from space that begin and end the film suggest, it’s really about our culture, our society, and ultimately our imperfect and all too human world.Original Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;48 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

The guy who made Guardians of the Galaxy one of the few Marvel movies that doesn’t feel like the product of an assembly line (a sleek, efficient, and effective assembly line, but an assembly line all the same) was the same dude who made his first mark on popular culture by mashing up Romeo &amp; Juliet and The Toxic Avenger for the benefit of stoned idiots and the educated alike.Gunn has always been brash and outspoken (graduates of Troma are not generally known for their coquettish ways and tasteful restraint), but when you make a billion-dollar movie that inevitably leads to another billion-dollar blockbuster (that would be Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which is already underway) the world tends to pay close attention to what you have to say.“The film implicitly asks why we find some forms of violence exciting and fun, and others abhorrent and disturbing.”So when Gunn laid into studios and the media on Facebook for learning all of the wrong, lazy lessons from smash success of the hard-R rated Deadpool (another oddball, overachieving member of the Marvel family), he found a receptive audience.Gunn passionately argued, “Deadpool was its own thing. THAT’S what people are reacting to. It’s original, it’s damn good, it was made with love by the filmmakers, and it wasn’t afraid to take risks.”Original and good are both scary and unfamiliar to studio executives. They don’t trust either quality, as they’re both liable to scare away audiences. Subsequently, they’re most likely to pick up on the most easily copyable elements of Deadpool — namely, the fourth-wall-breaking, post-modern tone, the R-rated violence, and the swaggering, smart-ass attitude.Gunn is among the hottest filmmakers alive. Deadpool’s paradigm-shifting early success almost instantly transformed the concept of an R-rated superhero movie from a massive risk into a tantalizing commercial proposition. I imagine that all over Hollywood, hacks are feverishly cramming profanity, sex scenes and pop-culture references into previous family-friendly superhero opuses.Yet a mere half decade ago, Gunn wrote and directed a hard-R rated superhero movie (one that easily could have been NC-17) that failed to gross even a million dollars. Now, I’m no mathematician, but a billion is substantially more than a million — and even a million is substantially more than the sum grossed by Gunn’s blood-soaked, brain-splattering labor of love, Super.According to the money-counting folks over at Box Office Mojo, Super&nbsp;made less than half a million dollars. That’s a pittance even given the film’s tiny budget, but I can’t help but feel like Super isn’t just a movie that didn’t make a lot of money — no, it’s a movie that couldn’t (and probably shouldn’t) have made a lot of money.Super is less a conventional superhero movie than an alternately grim and goofy meditation on what Taxi Driver might have looked like if Travis Bickle had put on a homemade superhero costume and decided to channel his vigilante instincts into beating criminals to death with a giant wrench rather than going the gun-and-assassination route. That’s a big part of what makes the film bold and audacious, but it also explains its complete commercial failure.In a role originally intended for John C. Reilly, Rainn Wilson stars as Frank, a sad-sack short-order cook who plasters crude, childlike drawings of the two happiest moments of his life&nbsp;— when he married wife Sarah (Liv Tyler) and helped police officers pursuing a criminal — in his shabby little home as a perpetual reminder that the world has more to offer than just misery, humiliation, and an endless gauntlet of pain and suffering.Frank clings to his sense of morality, to his sense of how things should be, and his bond with Sarah as life preservers in a cold, cold world forever threatening to drown him in his sorrows. Then one day Sarah stumbles out of his life, seemingly permanently, after getting involved with a scumbag drug dealer named Jock (played by Kevin Bacon).Sarah was a recovering addict who married Frank as one of those mistakes people sometimes make while they’re still in the fumbling, fawn-like early process of recovery. In a flashback, we see her weeping while they have sex, and it’s unclear whether she’s in tears because she’s so raw and vulnerable and open without drugs or alcohol to numb her emotions, or whether she’s crying because she looks like Liv Tyler and she’s having sex with a man who looks like a particularly pathetic Rainn Wilson.“It’s a film that uses an insane comic-book plot to explore belief and morality and purpose and addiction and connection.”The real villain in Frank and Sarah’s life and relationship isn’t a low-rent dope peddler, but addiction. Sarah seems to have gravitated towards Frank because he was so removed from the drug-fueled realm of decadence she needed to escape — a simple, honorable man who doesn’t seem to understand why people would ever use drugs when they’re illegal, let alone be driven by the compulsions that gripped his bride.Frank can’t understand that Sarah is sick, and that sometimes in people’s sickness and disease and addictions, they make terrible decisions that hurt themselves and the people who love them and society as a whole. To make sense of the situation, his brain transforms Sarah’s selfish, drug-fueled withdrawal into something more palatable — he decides that Jock stole Sarah and forced her to use drugs, and he just needs to get her back to heal the massive hole in his soul.Without Sarah, Frank is adrift; lost, a raw nerve just barely functioning in the world. He’s a man in need of a sign, in need of direction, in need of a purpose. Then, one curious night while watching television, God (voiced by Rob Zombie, in a shameless bit of typecasting) sinks His tentacles into Frank’s body, runs his enormous finger over Frank’s brain, and instills him with a sense of purpose: it will be his fate to fight evil and crime wherever he goes, to reinvent himself from a sniveling sub-human to a super-heroic crime fighter known as the Crimson Bolt.Frank is aided in this revelation by “The Holy Avenger” (Nathan Fillion), a cut-rate Christian superhero in the vein of Willie Aames’ Bibleman, whose hilariously cheap, bible-thumping productions always seem to be on the verge of turning into pornography. It’s as if The Holy Avenger gang is intent on simultaneously filming their Christlike morality tales and an X-rated parody.As a crimefighter, Frank is a distinct primitivist, and his fight scenes feel like deliberately cheap, artless throwbacks to Gunn’s Troma days, fortified with elements borrowed from the 1960s Batman. Frank is driven by a divine sense of purpose, but his efforts quickly devolve into a form of crime itself.Frank brutally beats child molesters and drug dealers, but he also takes his wrench of rage to people who’ve done nothing more serious than cut in line at a movie. I remembered Super being stomach-churning in its violence, but re-watching the film for this column, I see less than I remembered. Gunn doesn’t need to pile on scene after scene of sickening bloodshed: the inhuman thud of metal smashing into meat and flesh as Frank clobbers one mortified bad guy after another indelibly conveys the sadistic, grotesquely excessive brutality of his actions. The film implicitly asks why we find some forms of violence exciting and fun, and others abhorrent and disturbing. The answer has a lot to do with morality, but Frank’s ideals are unstinting and unforgiving that he blurs the line between hero, anti-hero, and villain.Frank has a child’s black and white worldview, and sense that evil is an uncomplicated entity that simply needs to be punished for good to prevail. But he reluctantly picks up a sidekick who calls herself Boltie (Ellen Page, in the kind of performance you imagine her agent having a heart attack over) who is, if anything, even more bloodthirsty and over-the-top in her violence.She’s motivated less by a conventional sense of morality than a fetish for being a superhero that always has a sexual component to it (she’s getting off on the idea of being Robin to his Batman) but becomes assaultive when she rapes Frank while they’re both wearing their costumes.Boltie is the demon hanging over Frank’s shoulder, urging him to give in to his worst, most brutal instincts. If he’s deeply troubled, she’s a sociopath. Together, they’re less a traditional crimefighting duo than a pair of delusional psychopaths feeding into each other’s madness and dysfunction.Many elements of Super are campy and broad in outline. The protagonist is “touched” in the head, in both the metaphorical and literal sense. There is a delirious animated opening sequence where the Crimson Bolt and Bolty don’t just swiftly and ably dispense justice in a way they never do in the actual film, but also dance exuberantly, and some of the most unnerving violence is accompanied by comic book flourishes.“Underneath the Troma-style wackiness is a fundamentally serious, even tragic film about a lost man in a lost world.”But underneath the Troma-style wackiness is a fundamentally serious, even tragic film about a lost man in a lost world seeking transcendence and meaning in the worst possible way. It is a film that uses an insane comic-book plot to explore belief and morality and purpose and addiction and connection.Gunn has wrestled with drugs and alcohol in the past (struggles that inform his haunting and poignant 2000 semi-autobiographical novel The Toy Collector, whose protagonist is named James Gunn) and Super’s treatment of addiction and recovery is one of the places where its intense sincerity is most powerful.The film ends with its hapless hero retiring his Crimson Bolt persona and returning to normal life after he succeeds in freeing Sarah from Jock’s clutches and sends her on the path to recovery. With noble self-sacrifice, he helps a woman he realizes is much too good for him find herself and her purpose, a process that inevitably involves her leaving him for a man who is not so broken, not so damaged, and capable of giving her the life she’s always wanted, complete with a brood of adorable, apple-cheeked children.The Crimson Bolt sets out to be God’s holy wrench of vengeance, but comes to understand that he’s not supposed to save the world. He’s not even supposed to save his wife. No, he’s supposed to give this good but sick woman the tools she needs to save herself. There’s grace in that. There’s transcendence. There’s beauty and purity and compassion in that sacrifice. After alternating between comic book comedy and aching tragedy for much of its duration, Super finds an elegiac, poetic tone as it reaches an incongruously beautiful and pure conclusion.Wilson invests the film’s protagonist with total emotional investment, but I couldn’t help but think that Reilly would have been better in the role. There’s an ingratiating sweetness at Reilly’s core that makes it easy to root for him no matter how misguided his actions, and while Wilson is good, there’s a prickliness to his persona that’s a little off-putting. Then again, there’s a whole lot that’s off-putting about Super, which is one of the reasons I like it so much.To quote Gunn on Deadpool (whose hero also wears a red suit and has some issues), Super is its own thing. It’s original, it’s damn good, and it was made with love by the filmmakers, and it wasn’t afraid to take risks. Yet it was precisely those qualities that kept audiences away, and will keep future filmmakers from cynically ripping it off. It turns out that — commercially speaking, at least — there’s such a thing as being too original and too risky. So Super will remain forever Gunn’s own thing. He’s made his blockbuster superhero movie for the masses, but he clearly made Super for himself, and for a strange, small subset of cultists uniquely turned into its strange wavelength — touched, as it were, not by the finger of God, but by the strangely earnest and deep vision of a profoundly talented filmmaker.Original Certification:&nbsp;RottenTomatometer:&nbsp;48 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshFollow Nathan Rabin on Twitter:&nbsp;@nathanrabin","section":"Sub-Cult","tags":"Adventures, award, slashers, blockbuster, Trek, elevated","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/07125844/super-featured-image-e1457384368311.jpg","slug":"why-super-deserves-another-look"},{"id":"47508944892124","title":"Why 200 Cigarettes Falls Short of Cult Status","content":"Sub-Cultvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Why 200 Cigarettes Falls Short of Cult StatusSub-Cult is Nathan Rabin’s ongoing exploration of movies that have quietly attracted devoted followings and are on the verge of becoming full-on cult sensations.by Nathan Rabin | December 29, 2015 |  Comments&nbsp;When actors and crew people make the leap to directing, they tend to make movies that reflect their backgrounds. Actors gravitate toward the kind of intense, emotional showcases that give them and their collaborators the juicy speeches, scenes, and dramatic moments they are cruelly spared when directed by those whose lives do not revolve around the sacred art of pretending to be other people for money. When writers get the big promotion to director, their emphasis is, quite naturally, on the written word, on dialogue and monologues and preserving the integrity of their own words or someone else’s. Choreographers, cinematographers, and production designers tend to make movies that are elegantly put together and lovely to look at, but a little empty and dramatically inert. As for producers, well, I’ve been writing about pop culture for close to two decades and once spent a weekend at the home of super-producer Robert Evans, and I still cannot, for the life of me, tell you exactly what it is that a producer does, except that it seems to involve a lot of ego, money, manipulation, seduction, dishonesty and cocaine. I suppose when producers become directors, the product represents those obsessions as well.It should not come as a surprise, then, that when casting directors become director directors, their films are often defined by some really amazing ensembles. A case in point would be Risa Bramon Garcia, the director of the 1999 non-cult classic 200 Cigarettes, which is wholly acceptable hangover viewing on New Year’s Day but had the potential to be infinitely more.&nbsp;Garcia’s career as a casting director almost couldn’t have begun on a more auspicious note: according to IMDB, her first credit was on 1985’s Desperately Seeking Susan, a film that briefly made Madonna a movie star as well as a pop icon.&nbsp;From there, Garcia racked up impressive credits for casting movies like Something Wild (which broke Ray Liotta), Fatal Attraction, Wall Street, True Romance, Natural Born Killers, Twister,&nbsp;and Flirting With Disaster. That is one hell of a record for spotting talent, and on a mere casting level alone, 200 Cigarettes is a goddamned triumph: the film&nbsp;brings together (drumroll please) Dave Chappelle, Courtney Love, Elvis Costello, Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Martha Plimpton, Paul Rudd, Janeane Garofalo, Christina Ricci, Jay Mohr, Kate Hudson, Gaby Hoffman, David Johansen and Caleb Carr in one stunningly inconsequential wisp of a movie.Unfortunately, 200 Cigarettes barely even feels like a movie; it’s more like a&nbsp;1980s dress-up party special on MTV (whose film division had a hand in this, as it did Dazed &amp; Confused) with a narrative clumsily shoehorned in. Despite its period setting, in terms of cast, tone and sensibility, the film could not be more a product of its time. Honestly, if Daria and My So Called Life somehow achieved sentience and co-hosted 120 Minutes, the results wouldn’t feel more 1990s than 200 Cigarettes, or more MTV.“The only thing keeping it&nbsp;from being a cultural touchstone and beloved cult classic is that it is no good at all.”Wikipedia calls the film “a mosaic”, which is a pretentious way of saying it is a project with a bunch of different stories you don’t care about. In a deliberate nod to American Graffiti and Dazed &amp; Confused, it follows a broad cross-section of lovelorn or just plain horny twenty-somethings as they try to find love or hook up by the time the clock strikes midnight. Though I would argue its cast is on par with those two films, which is no faint praise, as they&nbsp;are easily two of the best cast films of all time,&nbsp;200 Cigarettes falls short in every other respect.It has&nbsp;a fun premise and a neat retro setting — New York in the early 1980s — and, like so many of the films I’m covering for this column, it benefits from a sort of double nostalgia, since the gap between today and when the film was released (about sixteen years) is roughly the same as the time between when it was made and when it’s set. Unfortunately, 200 Cigarettes fails as both a 1980s and a 1990s nostalgia movie, although not because it doesn’t pander hard enough.&nbsp;Yes, the only thing keeping it&nbsp;from being a cultural touchstone and beloved cult classic is that it is no good at all. Of course, no movie with a young Dave Chappelle and Paul Rudd can be completely worthless, but given the talent assembled, it’s almost impressive how little the filmmakers were able to accomplish.The film’s multiple vignettes are connected by Chappelle’s cabbie character, a funky-fresh amalgam of Rick James, Bootsy Collins and Chappelle’s own persona whose cab serves as a disco on wheels, a mobile blast of 1970s love vibes liberally laced with marijuana smoke and advice of varying levels of quality. He ferries many of the film’s characters, including an adorably rage-filled young man played by Rudd who has just been dumped by girlfriend Janeane Garofalo and is drowning his sorrows in booze and contemplating best friend Courtney Love’s offer to be his New Year’s Eve fling. Could these friends actually be soul mates in disguise? Could friendship lead to love? If decades of romantic comedy tradition are any indication, the answer is yes, and 200 Cigarettes is nothing if not a slave to conventions of all sorts.Kate Hudson shows up as a lovable klutz who loses her virginity to a cad played by Jay Mohr and then follows him around like a lost, crying puppy in a debutante’s sad little party dress. If 200 Cigarettes were a smarter or more self-aware movie, Hudson’s character might have come across as an inspired caricature of a familiar romantic comedy archetype, the gorgeous woman whose beauty is undercut by her inability to master even the most basic of social and societal functions. Instead, the character’s a groaning cliche. At least give this subplot credit for succinctness; it’s a dreadful two-hour romantic comedy about mismatched lovers condensed into a 15 minute subplot begging for the cutting room floor.“200 Cigarettes doesn’t have a whole lot more to offer than glimpses of how adorable Paul Rudd was when he was younger.”Other&nbsp;subplots begging to be cut&nbsp;include one about a pair of sentient Long Island accents (played by Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman in performances designed exclusively to please their dialect coaches) who are on the hunt for big city romance with rockers and have to make do with a pair of scruffy roadies (Guillermo Diaz and a young Casey Affleck) who have the carefully cultivated scuzziness of punk rockers and the interiors of nice young men, as well as a bartender played by Ben Affleck who comes between a pair of competitive friends.The disparate stories are also linked by a party thrown by Martha Plimpton, who drinks herself into a blackout worrying that no one will come to her soiree and deals with the sexual insecurities of an ex-boyfriend played by Brian McCardie. Like real-life New Year’s Eves, 200 Cigarettes is an orgy of disappointment for its characters as they struggle and fail to hook up with the people they think they want, and end up with whoever’s around. Conveniently,&nbsp;a film-ending photo montage narrated by Chappelle reveals that after Plimpton’s character passed out drunk, everyone came to her party, had a blast, and ended up hooking up, including Garofalo and Elvis Costello (playing himself) in what I imagine is some nerd’s nerdiest sexual fantasy.200 Cigarettes is quintessential Yearbook Cinema: much — if not most — of the fun and excitement comes from the weak little rush that comes with seeing familiar faces before they became familiar, in seeing a coterie of big names from across the pop culture spectrum at a time when their careers were, for the most part, still young. The problem is that 200 Cigarettes doesn’t have a whole lot more to offer than glimpses of how adorable Paul Rudd was when he was younger.Time has made a remarkable cast even more impressive, but during Courtney Love, Paul Rudd and Dave Chappelle’s one scene together all I could think about was Gene Siskel’s oft-noted comment about how frustrating it is to see movies where simply watching&nbsp;the cast eat together would almost assuredly be more entertaining than what they’re doing onscreen. I think it’s safe to assume that even if they were discussing the relative quality of anti-fungal ointments, or comparing their retirement plans, a real-life conversation between Rudd, Love and Chappelle would by definition have to be more compelling than their scene here.But even in this comic wasteland, which aspires only to slick mediocrity and fails to realize even its modest ambitions, Chappelle is a consistent delight, even if the film doesn’t really seem to have any idea what to do with him beyond putting the camera on him and letting him go.&nbsp;Part of what makes him&nbsp;such a joy to watch is the palpable, infectious joy he takes in his own gifts, in that sheepish, little boy grin he sports when he’s getting high off his own irreverent genius. While&nbsp;everyone else is working overtime to&nbsp; breathe life into cardboard characters and a stale script, Chappelle is clearly having a blast, acting in a movie of his own that just happens to overlap with the one occupied by all of these lesser performers. It’s as if he’s in a high school band where everyone is trying to figure out simple chords while he’s bashing out a crazy Buddy Rich solo on the drums, arms flailing wildly, eyes ablaze with fiery intensity as he gets lost in a stoned frenzy of self-delight.“Chappelle is a consistent delight, even if the film doesn’t really seem to have any idea what to do with him.”Chappelle’s cabbie fits the parameters of the Magical Negro,&nbsp;a smiling yet sassy black man who shows up and imparts casual life lessons to the uptight, neurotic people in his cab. But he&nbsp;turns the archetype on its head by establishing in no uncertain terms that for all of his chill-ass counsel, he’s really only concerned with getting high, getting laid, and amusing himself. He’s not there for the benefit of these uptight white people; they’re there to amuse him, to give him something to play off until his shift is over.In its own unfortunate fashion, 200 Cigarettes is all too faithful to the intense emotions of New Year’s Eve. From the outset, it radiates potential and excitement; the possibilities are limitless. In theory, it is a magical time, a time of romance and optimism and bittersweet nostalgia for the year that passed, a time when people might find their soulmates before the clock strikes midnight or make memories that will last a lifetime. In actuality, New Year’s Eve is more often a time when people force themselves to wear fancy clothes they find uncomfortable and out of character so they can go to a party and make agonizing small talk with people they don’t enjoy anywhere near as much as they’re supposed to, all the while wishing they were at home in bed and that all of the nonsense and hype was over.&nbsp;In that respect, the film&nbsp;is remarkably true to life; it’s filled with characters and actors you imagine you’ll love spending a fizzy 90 or so minutes with, but who almost instantly wear out their welcome, with the exception of Chappelle and Rudd.New Year’s Eve is a time for memory and anticipation, and 200 Cigarettes unwittingly captures that for most people, those memories consist primarily of how consistently New Year’s Eve has sucked, despite their fervent plans and desires, and that anticipation revolves around how this upcoming year will probably suck too. Also like the typical New Year’s Eve, enjoyment of 200 Cigarettes is dependent on lowering expectations until they’re borderline non-existent, and in convincing yourself that you’re having a much better time than you actually are. Instead of commenting satirically on the inevitable disappointment engendered by this flashiest of holidays, 200 Cigarettes just ends up reproducing that disappointment in breezy but eminently forgettable and skippable cinematic form.Original Certification:&nbsp;RottenTomatometer:&nbsp;28 percentRe-Certification: RottenFollow Nathan Rabin on Twitter: @NathanRabin","section":"Sub-Cult","tags":"drama, Plus, films, YouTube, Esquire, jamie, jurassic, south, ABC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/29185834/200CigarettesSub-Cult.jpg","slug":"why-200-cigarettes-falls-short-of-cult-status"},{"id":"47508944879828","title":"Is Spice World Worth Another Look?","content":"Sub-Cultvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Is Spice World Worth Another Look?With a Spice Girls reunion tour on the horizon, we look back at their lone big-screen vehicle -- and ponder how pop music has changed since its release.by Nathan Rabin | June 21, 2016 |  Comments&nbsp;The early 1990s were a curious and&nbsp;amazing time to come of age as a pop music obsessive. I feel both blessed and cursed to have entered my teenage years in 1990. On one hand, I had cultural touchstones like Nirvana’s Nevermind, Dr. Dre’s The Chronic,&nbsp;and De La Soul’s 3 Feet High And Rising to teach me perfection. At the same time, the era was ruled by a peculiar&nbsp;puritanism that insisted that, contrary to the strongly held convictions of previous generations, pop music was not fun, and was not supposed to be fun, and that if pop music was caught being fun, then it should politely excuse itself and return wearing a flannel shirt and too much black eyeliner, mumbling something about the ineffable misery of everyday existence and how much it hates its parents.Strange self-conscious obsessions with ethics and authenticity plagued pop music at the time, and artists&nbsp;were burdened with having to pretend that their strong sense of personal integrity&nbsp;were informed by the anti-corporate puritanism of Ian MacKaye — even if, like all decent Americans, they’d much rather listen to The Monkees’ Greatest Hits than Minor Threat.All of the reasons people had historically gotten into pop music before — money, sex, fame, drugs, an overbearing stage parent&nbsp;— were suddenly considered crass and unacceptably mercenary. No, people were inexplicably — and, I think, nonsensically — supposed to get into pop music solely for self-expression, for the sake of their art, to carry on a noble tradition that dates back to Lou Reed, John Cale, Alex Chilton and those other guys who were in Big Star, Sid Vicious, Joe Strummer, and so on.&nbsp;It was ultimately tedious, untenable, and unfair to audiences and musicians alike. It was unfair because it robbed pop stars of their inalienable, god-given right to be tacky and mercenary and vulgar and wantonly sexual in a calculating way and kitschy and fun and whoever the hell they wanted to be, whether it fit within the parameters of “authenticity” or not. And it robbed fans of the right to be horny and dumb and immature and tacky and all the other things that make pop music so much fun.Are the Spice Girls in on the joke? Is there even a joke?Then came the Spice Girls to remind a world obsessed with authenticity that pop music was supposed to be about having a good time, that it was supposed to be sexy, plastic, silly, and nothing to take seriously. And if the group’s vibe and sound and image were unmistakably tacky, pre-fabricated, and silly, well, despite what the authenticity police of the early 1990s would tell you, that was no crime. Plus,&nbsp;they offered something for everyone: tight outfits and winking sexuality for the dads, girl power (as in feminism with fewer ideas and more wonder-bras and spandex) role models for girls not enthralled with the Courtney Love school of femininity, and hummable anthems to work out or dance to for gay guys and moms on the go.The women’s nicknames doubled as descriptions of their persona. Geri “Ginger Spice” Halliwell was all about bosomy sass, although her&nbsp;solo career unintentionally disproved the old maxim about sex selling. Emma “Baby Spice” Bunton trafficked in an aggressively child-like sexuality (think Lolita, but skewing much younger). Victoria “Posh Spice” Beckham was all about icy aristocratic condescension. Melanie “Sporty Spice” Chisholm lived life as if it was one giant spin class she was intent on winning and earned her nickname because “Ambiguously Lesbian Spice” was just a little too progressive for the time, even for a group as gay-friendly as the Spice Girls (honestly, it would not surprise me to learn that “Sporty Spice” was played by a gifted transvestite the entire time). Lastly, Melanie “Scary Spice” Brown earned her nickname by virtue of being black, and what’s scarier than the unimaginable horrors white society has afflicted upon black people throughout the centuries, whether through slavery, institutionalized racism, or just individual bigotry?Spice World, the first and, it should be noted, final cinematic vehicle for the Spice Girls, arrived at a strange, uncertain time for the group. The initial flush of their&nbsp;enormous worldwide success had passed. They were still huge, but they weren’t quite the white-hot pop culture fad/phenomenon they once were, and the days of what could very generously be deemed their “classic” line-up — the one with Geri Halliwell, the first to bolt by trading group success for solo failure — were rapidly coming to an end.The film’s tone reflects that uncertainty. Its existence implicitly asks a bunch of questions the film doesn’t seem prepared to answer. Are the Spice Girls in on the joke? Is there even a joke? Are they&nbsp;a tongue-in-cheek post-modern goof reveling in their own artificiality or a spunky exemplar of girl power worth celebrating non-ironically?To aid the Spice Girls in this quest to determine who exactly they were, before expressing that truth cinematically, the women had the earlier example of the Beatles, who engineered the perfect post-modern tribute to —&nbsp;and parody of — the kooky mechanics of pop superstardom with 1964’s A Hard Day’s Night,&nbsp;and the Sex Pistols, who, minus one John Lydon, navigated this territory much more shakily, but with utterly compelling results, with its even more aggressively post-modern, reality-blurring movie The Great Rock And Roll Swindle.&nbsp;But the Spice Girls were most assuredly not the Beatles or the Sex Pistols, and the film they made all too accurately conveyed the massive gulf in quality and significance between them and these giants. And oh boy, does Spice World borrow shamelessly from the Hard Day’s Night template.Richard E. Grant steals scenes through furious exertion as the group’s perpetually overwhelmed manager.We see the Spice Girls as the world sees them, and Spice World is considerate enough to provide a series of different filters through which to process the pop culture phenomenon. There’s an oily, malevolent paparazzi press out to sell papers by breaking up the band; they’re represented by a Rupert Murdoch-like mogul played by Barry Humphries and his chief henchman, a paparazzo with Jason Bourne-like skills played by The Rocky Horror Picture Show’s Richard O’Brien.Then there’s a documentary crew headed by a character played by Alan Cumming, who sees the Spice Girls phenomenon through the thuddingly earnest lens of breathless documentary ambition, and a pair of filmmakers played by George Wendt and Mark McKinney who try to crack the idea of a cinematic vehicle for the Spice Girls throughout the film. The latter pair ultimately succeed in an end-credit sequence, where the film doubles back on itself and becomes about the fictional filmmakers making the real movie we’ve just seen (is your mind blown yet?).Englishness is an essential part of the group’s brand, and in Spice World, they play it to the hilt; their vehicle is a double-decked bus emblazoned with the Union Jack that is infinitely bigger on the inside than it appears from the outside. Roger Moore is one of an endless series of winking cameos as “The Chief,” a dashing international man of mystery forever petting a cat and dispensing nonsensical bromides to his underlings. The film’s tone of appropriately&nbsp;English camp, though, proves quickly exhausting and reveals a limited comic sensibility, especially when executed by amateurs like the Spice Girls.As a result, Spice World feels unmistakably like a 1970s variety show full of Family Guy-style cutaway gags, campy celebrity appearances from cornballs like Meat Loaf who stop just short of breaking the fourth wall and winking at the camera to show how in on the joke they are, and broad caricatures like a demented old British military man who is also a choreographer.The film establishes its quintet of empowered women as the mildest of rebels, who are asked time and again to do something cheesy and lame, only to offer a moderate protest by doing something similar but slightly more suited to their style. Like the Beatles in A Hard Day’s Night, they are forever itching to bust out of the confines of pop stardom and the inhuman pressures of maintaining a squeaky-clean teenybopper image, but that really just adds up to the women wanting to spend time with a pregnant friend who symbolizes their pre-fame lives and maybe singing and dancing in environments more spontaneous than they’re used to.Through it all, Richard E. Grant steals scenes through furious exertion as the group’s perpetually overwhelmed manager; everyone else is in Spice World,&nbsp;but he rather nakedly angles to reorient the film’s focus (successfully, for the most part) so that it might as well be Richard E. Grant World. Heaven knows he does all the heavy lifting comedically, and while everyone else is playing it as broad as a variety show, he’s sweating his way through the film in a manner that suggests he collapsed in a lump the day shooting ended and didn’t wake up for a week.Spice World is tepid, little more than a series of arbitrary musical performances strung together with campy foolishness.Spice World is tepid, little more than a series of arbitrary musical performances strung together with campy foolishness. The film views the idea that anyone might want more from the Girls than silly escapist fun with suspicion; in his non-starting sub-plot, Cumming’s pretentious documentarian says he wants to “Crash through the show-biz facade,”&nbsp;but Spice World, the cinematic equivalent of a fan magazine (and about as satirical and biting as one), is content with respectfully leaving the show-biz facade intact.&nbsp;The Spice Girls helped liberate the pop world from the dreary dictates of grungy obsessions with authenticity and realness, and I will forever be thankful to them for that. But once you have established yourself as the most artificial&nbsp;of fizzy pop phenomena, you can’t then try to double-back and make some dubious claim of authenticity.Accordingly, no scene in this goofy&nbsp;movie is sillier, more ridiculous, or more preposterous than the one that professes to show the Spice Girls before they became the Spice Girls, when they were just a group of hungry up-and-comers singing for their supper by performing a scruffy version of “Wannabe” for a jazz-loving early benefactor. In this flashback, their costumes, attitudes, and personas all feel, if anything, far more insincere&nbsp;and contrived than what they wear as superstars, whose every move and look is carefully cultivated by trained, highly paid professionals.Spice World is a pleasant mediocrity in large part because the music is&nbsp;such dumb, bubblegum fun, closing with a sassy performance of “Spice Up Your Life,” the big monster single from the soundtrack. It’s a song I will always associate with my baby sister; she’s a professor now, having recently graduated with a doctorate from Yale, but at the time of Spice World, she was just an unironic pop fan with a serious jones for that particular jam.Hearing the song again engendered a pleasant burst of nostalgia as I reflected back on the simple pleasure pop music provides. Spice World’s appeal is almost entirely attributable to nostalgia, and musical nostalgia is perhaps the purest and most powerful pop culture form. But the 85 eminently forgettable, cheekily bland minutes leading up to this blast from the past underscore the limitations of nostalgia as well, and in the cold light of day, in the year 2016, when the Spice Girls are less the hot new thing than an oldies nostalgia act, Spice World hits those limitations hard.Original Certification:&nbsp;RottenTomatometer:&nbsp;36 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;RottenNathan Rabin if a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

Granted, that’s a marked improvement, but it’s still not much to build a lasting, substantive career upon.Then again, Reynolds’ early roles didn’t give him a whole lot to work with. The “super-senior” he&nbsp;played in Van Wilder was memorable in the worst possible way; a frat boy icon that demanded an insufferable level of glibness, Reynolds was the jerky face of National Lampoon’s sad decline. In the years that followed, he&nbsp;starred in a number of movies that were noteworthy for their terribleness, like Just Friends, where his muscular physique was briefly encased in a disturbingly unconvincing fat suit that made him look like a young Jiminy Glick, or The Change-Up, where he and Jason Bateman switched bodies after urinating in the same fountain, a distasteful plot that is, surprisingly enough, 100&nbsp;percent scientifically accurate.Reynolds has also managed to star in four — count ’em, four — comic book adaptations that run the gamut from abysmal to almost passable: the staggeringly pointless The Green Lantern;&nbsp;the deeply underwhelming X-Men Origins: Wolverine;&nbsp;the critically savaged box office bomb R.I.P.D, which even Jeff Bridges’ deranged homage to Sam Elliott failed to save; and Blade: Trinity, which was notable mainly for Jessica Biel’s tight pants.&nbsp;Yet despite his aggressively undistinguished record as a superhero, people are nevertheless agog with anticipation over Reynolds’ upcoming turn as Deadpool in the vehicle of the same name, resurrecting a character he’s actually already played once, specifically in Wolverine, a deservedly unloved film.“Reynolds delivers a revelatory triple performance… this is most assuredly not your typical Ryan Reynolds movie.”What changed? In the past decade or so, Reynolds has quietly but unmistakably come into his own as an actor. A onetime male starlet people reluctantly tolerated because he was so damned pretty evolved into an actor of substance whose work people actively look forward to. Last year was a banner year for Reynolds as an actor.&nbsp;He gave a widely acclaimed performance in the gritty character study Mississippi Grind,&nbsp;and he was nothing short of fantastic in The Voices, a movie with an outrageous premise — a big-hearted but guileless factory worker accidentally becomes something of a mass murderer at the behest of his evil talking cat and in spite of the best efforts of his kindly talking dog — and an unlikely director (Marjane Satrapi, co-writer and co-director of the Academy Award-nominated Persepolis, an adaptation of her acclaimed autobiographical graphic novel) that sunk like a stone, or at the very least did not get the attention it merited.Reynolds was the heart and soul of The Voices. If he had played the role with the glibness of his Van Wilder days, the film would have come off as a cheap joke, a sordid wallow in campy bad taste. Instead, Reynolds gave the character a poignant sincerity and deep-seated need to do good. He made the character — and the film — not only funny and dark but also oddly touching.In The Voices, Reynolds played multiple roles: the protagonist, the voice of the cat that bedevils him, and the voice of the dog that functions as the canine angel on his shoulder, encouraging him to do good.&nbsp;It was an audacious, bold performance that recalled the first movie that made me think I had underestimated Reynolds, the unclassifiable 2007 science-fiction mindbender&nbsp;The Nines, in which&nbsp;Reynolds also played multiple roles.The film marked the directorial debut of hotshot screenwriter and podcaster John August, who is best known for his many collaborations with Tim Burton, his much-buzzed-about script for Go,&nbsp;and big-money assignments like being one of the many, many scribes who contributed their sweat and blood to the Charlie’s Angels franchise.&nbsp;August is about as commercially successful as screenwriters get,&nbsp;but The Nines, which remains his&nbsp;sole feature-length effort behind the camera, is decidedly small and independent, a passion project modest in budget but rich with ambition and imagination.Though August was&nbsp;an A-list, in-demand screenwriter at the time and Reynolds was well on his way to becoming a genuine movie star, neither of them could have anticipated the component of The Nines who&nbsp;would go on to enjoy the most success. It wouldn’t be the wildly successful screenwriter making his directorial debut or the rising star, but rather a character actress named Melissa McCarthy best known for her television work. Her size and gender would have seemingly doomed her to a career full of sassy supporting roles, because we live in a society and film world that is already screamingly sexist but even more unforgivably cruel to women who do not fit our narrow and often sadistic conception of beauty.“McCarthy displays a gift for the snappy, machine-gun dialogue of a screwball heroine and a surprisingly potent chemistry with Reynolds.”Yet McCarthy became a huge movie star all the same for reasons that are apparent here, even if her nuanced, deft, and diverse performances are a far cry from the ribald slapstick that would make her famous. August, a longtime friend of McCarthy’s, wrote three roles specifically for her, and though she&nbsp;has done fantastic work in movies like Bridesmaids, she has never had a role that showcased her gifts so adroitly. McCarthy doesn’t just get to be funny and quick-witted and feisty. She’s also sexy, gently intimidating, wry, wisecracking, trippy, angry, metaphysical, spacey, betrayed, and righteous in her rage and indignation. She pretty much runs through the entire spectrum of human emotions in a single film.The same is true of Reynolds, who delivers a revelatory triple performance that opens with him playing Gary, the star of a CSI-like hit cop show who kicks off the action by setting his girlfriend’s things on fire and accidentally burning down his house in the process. In a manic frenzy of self-destruction, he swigs booze straight from the bottle before approaching a blonde-wigged prostitute played by future Academy Award-winner Octavia Spencer and urgently inquiring, “Hey, do you sell crack?”Audacious doesn’t begin to describe this opening. If nothing else, it indelibly establishes that this is most assuredly not your typical Ryan Reynolds movie. The actor’s rampage ends with him under&nbsp;house arrest, tended to by a publicist (McCarthy) who is gently terrifying, a hyper-competent, whip-smart show-business player who keeps her clients in check by delivering convincing threats with the sweetest of smiles.This first segment (titled “Chapt9r On9: The Prison9r”) leaps ecstatically from genre to genre with delirious disregard for the rules. It establishes The Nines as an edgy, gonzo show-business satire; a semi-musical; a romantic comedy; a metaphysical drama; and a Pirandello-style exercise in blurring reality and fiction, where the characters seem to understand, if only intuitively, that they are mere players in a story someone else is telling. August, a screenwriter used to serving the vision of others, revels in the intoxicating freedom of having complete control. He is the God of his own strange world, and if he wants his trippy show-business satire to become a musical just long enough for Davis to talk-sing her way through the Lieber-Stoller standard “Is That All There Is,” then dammit, The Nines is going to be a musical for three-and-a-half minutes or so.“The Prison9r” seems to take place equally in Hollywood, August’s fertile imagination, and The Twilight Zone. It begins at a manic, kinetic clip, with a dizzying flurry of misbehavior and clever, expertly delivered banter, particularly thanks to McCarthy, who displays a gift for the snappy, machine-gun dialogue of a screwball heroine and a surprisingly potent chemistry with Reynolds. Then, it all slows down and gets trippier, as Reynolds’ movie star becomes obsessed with the number nine and begins to suspect that his world isn’t at all what it appears to be, and that what he considers his identity may just be a role he’s playing, albeit in real life, instead of a TV show. That is, if such a thing as “real life” even exists at all in his world.“August lets his muse run wild, and the result proves that he is a true auteur, as a director as well as a writer.”In the second chapter, “R9ality T9l9vision”, Reynolds plays Gavin, a gay television showrunner and writer based on August himself —&nbsp;The Nines is so personal that part of it was even filmed at August’s own home — who is anxious about the premiere of a new drama he’s launching starring Melissa McCarthy as a version of herself.&nbsp;Gavin is at once the show’s God and a man who runs into the frustrating limits of his power at every turn, whether he’s spying on a focus group with entirely too much sway over the future and direction of the show or being bullied by executives who love McCarthy but force him to replace her with a more conventionally attractive actress, because, you know, television.“R9ality T9l9vision” takes the form of a reality show chronicling the unsteady birth of a TV series but it’s also a meditation on the nature of creation. It depicts writers as infinitely powerful beings with the ability to create dazzling new worlds, people, and conflicts out of thin air but who are also at the mercy of executives and audiences and producers and directors and script-doctors.&nbsp;August certainly knows all about the power and powerlessness of writers firsthand. He knows what it’s like to have a script like Go make him the red-hot screenwriter of the moment and what it’s like to be one of scores of writers&nbsp;pounding out draft after draft of Charlie’s Angels.The third and final segment, “Knowing,” again focuses on creators and creations and the slippery and elusive nature of identity and reality, this time through the story of video game creator and virtual world-builder Gabriel (Reynolds) whose car breaks down in a secluded area, leaving him, his wife (McCarthy), and his daughter (Elle Fanning) stranded. Gabriel asks for help from a mysterious woman played by Hope Davis, who doesn’t offer conventional assistance but does clue him in to the fundamental nature of his existence as someone who is not quite a god (God is 10 on a 1 to 10 scale); Gabriel’s number is, well, I suppose you can probably guess what his number is — here’s a hint: the film’s title — and he’s&nbsp;more powerful than koalas, who can control weather.I should probably reiterate here that this is played largely straight. No matter how insane, surreal, trippy, and absurd The Nines gets, it is fundamentally sincere. It is a film of ideas and imagination that is self-indulgent in the best possible sense. No longer burdened with serving Tim Burton’s (or McG’s) vision, August lets his muse run wild, and the result proves that he is a true auteur, as a director as well as a writer. This film&nbsp;exists because of August, but if he’d experienced a moment of doubt late in the game and decided to delete the screenplay, then the whole weird, wonderful, eminently inviting, and re-visitable world he created here would cease to exist, or it would exist solely as a memory in his mind that could also disappear over time.It remains to be seen whether playing yet another superhero in Deadpool will conclusively make Reynolds a mega-star, but The Nines proved, almost a decade ago, that he was absolutely brilliant at playing someone — or something — mysterious, unknowable yet unmistakably superhuman. The Nines isn’t perfect — no movie that takes this many crazy, inspired chances could be — but it’s pretty consistently brilliant.

First and foremost, it&nbsp;benefits from our unending fascination with the reductive, cartoon version of the 1950s that it&nbsp;helped lodge firmly in the public imagination. Set in 1959, Grease became synonymous with the idyll just before Camelot, despite the anachronistic disco flourishes on the soundtrack (Why disco? Cause disco, baby! Just do another rail and don’t worry your pretty little head about it!).The second form of nostalgia is not for the era during which the film is set, but rather when it was made. For me and pop culture geeks of my generation, 1978 was a magical year. Disco was triumphant. John Travolta came out of nowhere to become the star of the year thanks to the critical and commercial dominance of Saturday Night Fever (released at the tail end of 1977), which, in addition to its extraordinary commercial success, also won Travolta an Oscar nomination.&nbsp;Travolta also found time to star in a smash television show (Welcome Back, Kotter), and thanks to the Grease soundtrack (and not, it should be noted, due to his album Travolta Fever, also released in 1978), he was briefly a smash hit recording artist as well. Though the zeitgeist-capturing success of Jaws, Animal House and Star Wars signaled a profound change in the kinds of films Hollywood would be making, the Hollywood of the 1970s was still alive and well.Lastly, Grease benefits from the nostalgia audiences feel towards the time in their lives when they first discovered the film, which tends to be during their pre-critical childhood. Unless you are a willful pop culture Luddite, there is a very good chance that you’ve seen Grease, and&nbsp;probably more than once. Grease was sanitized enough to be acceptable for sleepover parties and late-night cable viewing but honest enough to depict high school as one long, frustrating, often unsuccessful attempt to get laid maddeningly and continuously interrupted by societally-mandated nonsense involving “school” and “church” and “family” and similar dreary obligations.In the grand tradition of lazy sequels, Grease 2 is essentially a gender-switched remake of the original. The action is still focussed on tough greasers the T-Birds, their distaff counterparts the Pink Ladies, and their mutual stomping (and prancing) grounds at Rydell High, only this time the goody-goody outsider isn’t a gorgeous Australian played by Olivia Newton-John, but her British cousin Michael Carrington, played by Maxwell Caulfield in the performance that launched him to anonymity.“Maxwell Caulfield in the performance that launched him to anonymity.”Everyone you forgot about from the first film is back! Well, not all of them, but some of them at least. Didi Conn returns as Frenchie alongside such other non-favorites from the original as Sid Caesar, Eve Arden, Dennis C. Stewart and Dody Goodman to provide the barest sliver of continuity between the two films, but it’s possible I’m underestimating the filmmakers and they got the guy who stood behind Travolta in the first film to lurk behind Caulfield in this one. Specifically, Frenchie is on hand to assure Michael that any cousin of Sandy is a cousin to her too, and to re-enroll back in school to learn cosmology, since her failure at beauty school is canonical within the Greaseverse and the Grease multiverse.Frenchie is also on hand to provide the most hilariously desperate line in the movie, a clearly post-dubbed, late-in-the-game addition just after an opening production number (named and themed with exquisite literal-mindedness, “Back To School Again,” which should offer a sense of the level of originality and creativity on display here) where she optimistically enthuses, ostensibly to an anxious Michael, but really to the audience, “You’re gonna love Rydell!” There is then a dramatic pause before the offscreen voice of one of the Four Tops who croon the song helpfully completes that sentiment with “Again!” Any movie that feels the need to assure audiences that they are gonna love the shenanigans in this kooky high school a second time around is clearly not operating from a position of strength.Michelle Pfeiffer stars as Stephanie, the moody leader of the Pink Ladies and, along with Caulfield, one of two people&nbsp;in the film who seem to realize that they are acting in a movie, and not a dinner theater performance for the vision and hearing impaired in a Florida retirement home where every gesture and line needs to be exaggerated just to be understood, let alone enjoyed.Caulfield is cursed to be hopelessly inadequate in the Olivia Newton-John role, but even he fares better than Adrian Zmed (who you most assuredly probably do not know as the other guy on T.J. Hooker), who was in his late twenties when he played Johnny but could easily pass for 40. True, Stockard Channing was so mature-looking in the first Grease that she could have easily played either Betty Rizzo or Betty Rizzo’s mother, but she at least had extraordinary talent to fall back on; all Zmed has is giant hair and Travolta’s poorly recycled dance moves.The problem with Grease 2 is that it plays like a cartoon of a cartoon. It takes a franchise that already teetered on the brink of self-parody and pushes it madly into the realm of delirious self-satire. If Grease was deeply attuned to the hormonal madness of teenaged life, Grease 2 is essentially a 14-year-old with a perpetual hard-on, which is also, in its own right, deeply true to high school life.The key to understanding Grease 2 is to realize that every song is about sex, some more overtly than others. There is, for example, a production number entitled “Score Tonight” that trades on the fortuitous coincidence that “scoring” figures prominently in both bowling and sex, albeit for different reasons.Really, there is no innocent tableau Grease 2’s filthy mind cannot cavalierly corrupt. 1950s heartthrob Tab Hunter, fresh off his career-revitalizing performance in John Waters’ Polyester, stammers and blushes his way through “Reproduction,” a song ostensibly about the manner by which flowers reproduce that’s actually a filthy exploration of the sex-crazed minds of Rydell High’s students, who seem to be in their late thirties on average.“Pfeiffer somehow manages to be sexy in a tough, non-pandering way.”Not even the prospect of mutually assured thermonuclear armageddon can keep the perverts of Grease 2 from obsessing about sex. In “Do It For Our Country,” one of the lesser T-Birds tries to convince one of the lesser Pink Ladies to break down and finally have sex with him in an underground bunker by having his buddies fake a nuclear war outside so that she’ll feel obligated to have sex with him for America. And Jesus. And apple pie and Norman Rockwell and Walt Disney and the New York Yankees and everything that makes our country great. In the film, that’s depicted as innocent hijinks, but in the real world, if a man faked a nuclear apocalypse to trick an unwilling woman into having sex with him it would be sleazy and unethical at best and possibly criminal at worst.Grease 2 doesn’t care. At a certain point, it begins nonsensically inserting sex in places where it doesn’t belong, seemingly in a weird attempt to bait audiences. So, not long after the T-Birds’ hilarious “pressuring a girl into sex via elaborate trickery” scheme fails, Zmed’s Johnny leads his lovable gang in a bewildering song and production number entitled “Prowlin.’”It would be creepy enough to just have a song called “Prowlin,'” an unnerving word rightly associated with rapists and sexual predators. But Grease 2 makes things even weirder and more nonsensical by making the song all about how guys on the make are absolutely guaranteed to get laid at the grocery store. Within Grease 2, grocery stores are apparently Plato’s Retreat-like dens of decadence and debauchery.Pfeiffer somehow manages to be sexy in a tough, non-pandering way in a movie that is incredibly sexual, yet incredibly unsexy despite pandering relentlessly. Beyond remaking Grease, only with the foreigner a dreamy boy this time, Grease 2’s plot centers on the T-Birds’ and Pink Ladies’ suspiciously fierce determination to win the school talent show and Michael’s attempts to win Stephanie’s heart by adopting the persona of Cool Rider, a mysterious biker outlaw whose leather-fetish get-up makes him look less like an actual biker than an extra from Cruising.Pfeiffer is so good and so committed here that she almost sells the preposterous conceit that a woman as cool and hip and gorgeous as Pfeiffer was — and remains — would fall rapturously in love with some goon in black motorcycle fetish gear who refuses to reveal his identity and appears to die mysteriously before mysteriously coming back to life like some cross between James Dean, Jesus Christ, and Poochie from The Simpsons. In Pfeiffer’s big production number, “Cool Rider,” the superstar-to-be accomplishes the seemingly impossible feat of putting across a dire “Leader Of The Pack” knockoff through steely determination and furious exertion, although even when delivered by Pfeiffer, the character’s desire for a man “cool enough” that he can “burn me through and through” sounds suspiciously like she’s aching to be burnt by a venereal disease if the guy is hot enough.In a movie where everyone is playing to the cheap seats, yelling their lines, and mugging wildly, Caulfield recedes so thoroughly into the background he nearly disappears. Whatever producer Allan Carr saw in Caulfield beyond exceptional hair and remarkable cheekbones failed to materialize onscreen. Of course, the filmmakers didn’t make it easy for Caulfield by having him simultaneously replace Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta (thereby making him the Olivia Newton-John Travolta of the film) as both the male romantic lead and the goody-goody foreigner without giving him much of a character to play.“There is no innocent tableau Grease 2’s filthy mind cannot cavalierly corrupt.”Director Patricia Birch, who choreographed the first film, seems far more comfortable orchestrating giant dance numbers where interchangeable singer-dancer-actor types, seemingly on their lunch break from Ed Debevic’s, gyrate in mad synchronicity with permanent cocaine smiles on their face than she is with dialogue. Caulfield has no chemistry with Pfeiffer; he’s a bland, hunky blank for audiences to project their own desires and fantasies upon even before he gives up what little identity he has to become the mysterious Cool Rider.But if Caulfield was aggressively vetoed as a bankable leading man by moviegoers and critics alike and made for a dreadfully insufficient Travolta replacement, plenty of girls (and boys) obviously deemed him sufficiently crush-worthy in the decades since Grease 2 came and went in theaters, and then fiendishly came back and hung on in its surprising and thriving afterlife on home video.Grease 2 earns its following partially to the way video stores leveled the field. In movie theaters, it&nbsp;might have been a critically reviled flop with a troubled production history and a pair of unknowns in the leads. But at video stores like the one where I worked as a teenager, Grease 2 was just another video to rent, like Grease, and if you’d seen Grease a whole bunch of times, as a lot of people clearly have, then why not rent the sequel?Morbid fascination, that eternal itch to find out just how bad notorious flops can be, certainly plays a role in Grease 2’s ascent from flop to cable and home video favorite, but the film’s strange semi-success is also attributable to the fact that it slavishly replicates all of the elements that made the original so enduring, albeit in degraded form. Though cleaned up from the stage version, Grease still possessed a little bit of that 1970s grit and soul, thanks largely to performances by Travolta and Stockard Channing that breathed life and heart into cardboard archetypes, but Grease 2 is pure comic strip, about as tough and true to adolescent life as a Bazooka Joe comic.Grease 2 is a tough film to evaluate because the very qualities that make it objectively terrible also make it a whole lot of fun. The songs here stand out because they are thoroughly, mesmerizingly, hypnotically, adverb-inducingly idiotic, not because they’re good, but because they lodge themselves in the brain all the same. And the over-the-top smuttiness that makes Grease 2 even dumber than its predecessor also renders it a surprisingly enjoyable exercise in delirious self-parody.Even today, Grease 2 continues to live within the shadow of its predecessor’s historic and never-ending success. But for a tacky little movie whose charms are almost entirely of the plastic variety, Grease leaves behind such a massive legacy that an even tackier, even more plastic sequel can exist entirely as a tardy footnote to the original and still enjoy, if not a proper cult following, then an unmistakable Sub-Cult. Grease 2 is so bad it’s kind of amazing, and kind of amazingly bad.My Original Certification: RottenMy Re-Certification: FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;32 percentUp next: Good Burger","section":"Sub-Cult","tags":"actors","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Grease2Sub-Cult1.jpg","slug":"does-grease-2-deserve-cult-status"},{"id":"47508949007610","title":"Rank Clint Eastwood’s 10 Best Movies as Director","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rank Clint Eastwood's 10 Best Movies as DirectorIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at the 15:17 to Paris director's best work behind the camera.by Jeff Giles | February 7, 2018 |  CommentsHe’s gone from TV star to action hero to one of the biggest stars in Hollywood — on both sides of the camera.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Capable of exuding a heart of gold or convincingly portraying a femme fatale (sometimes even within the same scene), she’s perfect for a murder mystery, and she’s got a long list of celebrated features to prove it. We’ve rounded up some of the best, and you know what that means — it’s time for Total Recall!1. The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989)  96%(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp/Everett Collection)We like to complain about the lack of original ideas in Hollywood, but The Fabulous Baker Boys&nbsp;is proof positive that you don’t need to do something new to make a great movie — you just need to do something really, really well. And Baker Boys does a few things well, actually — including exploring the tension between a pair of piano-playing brothers (played by real-life siblings Jeff and Beau Bridges), the fading hopes of musicians resigned to pursuing commerce instead of art, and — perhaps most importantly — highlighting the luminous beauty of Michelle Pfeiffer. It wasn’t a huge commercial hit at the time of its release, but it was profitable, and the overwhelmingly positive critical reaction has since been shared by the many millions who have seen it at home. “The Fabulous Baker Boys&nbsp;is like a beloved movie from the glory days of Hollywood,” wrote Rita Kempley of the Washington Post. “It transports you. It’s an American rhapsody.”2.&nbsp;Dangerous Liaisons (1988)  93%Director Stephen Frears made his grand Hollywood entrance with this adaptation of the Christopher Hampton play Les liaisons dangereuses&nbsp;(and the 18th-century novel it was based on), gussying up a star-studded American cast in corsets and powdered wigs, then setting them loose to do horrid things to one another. John Malkovich is at his most impeccably loathsome as the womanizing Valmont, who joins forces with the scheming Marquise de Merteuil (Glenn Close) to defile her cousin’s daughter (played by Uma Thurman). Liaisons&nbsp;is a tragedy, so you know it’ll all end in a mess of death and confusion — but getting there is a delicious good time involving oodles of etiquette, Pfeiffer at her most radiant, and a side helping of Keanu. A triple Oscar winner, Dangerous Liaisons&nbsp;blended starchy pre-Victorian propriety with good old-fashioned gettin’ down — a mixture that is, in the words of the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson, “Tantalizingly wicked — watching it makes the color rise to your cheeks.”3.&nbsp;Hairspray (2007)  91%(Photo by New Line/courtesy Everett Collection)A screen adaptation of a Broadway musical that was itself an adaptation of John Waters’ 1988 comedy, Hairspray&nbsp;certainly had tangled roots — but even if its origins made it look like a cash grab, the end result proved to be a sweetly effervescent musical comedy with a better-than-average cast that was led by an irresistible Nikki Blonsky and rounded out by Christopher Walken, John Travolta in drag, and Pfeiffer as the perfectly named Velma Von Tussle. Although she’s always been primarily known for her acting, Pfeiffer’s musical roles have been some of the most attention-getting of her career — she broke out in Grease 2, enchanted audiences in The Fabulous Baker Boys, and stole the show all over again in this updated version of Hairspray with her performance of “(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs.” “Enjoyable movies are released every week,” conceded the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick LaSalle. “But movies that have the capacity to delight — movies like Hairspray — are few and far between.”4. Married to the Mob (1988)  89%(Photo by Orion/courtesy Everett Collection)Pfeiffer earned her first Golden Globe nomination for her work in this Jonathan Demme comedy, which continued her ’80s hot streak by putting her in the heels of a fed up Mafia wife who sees her way out of the family after her philandering husband (Alec Baldwin) is killed by his boss (Dean Stockwell) — but then finds herself drawn back in when the boss develops a thing for her and&nbsp;she becomes the unwitting pawn of an FBI agent (Matthew Modine) determined to bring the operation down. With Demme at the reins, the screwball comedy became one of the year’s better-reviewed sleeper hits — and Pfeiffer was singled out by critics like Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who wrote, “Miss Pfeiffer, who looks utterly ravishing in outfits that set the teeth on edge, turns Angela’s plight into something funny, but she seems eminently sane even when the movie does not.”5. Scarface (1983)  82%(Photo by Universal/courtesy Everett Collection)Scarface director Brian De Palma was inspired by Howard Hawks and Richard Rosson’s 1932 gangster picture of the same name, but where the earlier version was a relatively straightforward morality play, De Palma’s ‘80s update offered viewers a far more lurid take on the rags-to-bullets tale of crime kingpin Tony Montana and his wife Elvira (Pfeiffer). Garishly violent and gleefully profane, Scarface&nbsp;endured an extended battle with the MPAA before bowing to decidedly mixed reviews, but it was a fairly sizable commercial hit — and critics have come around over the years, helping cement its status as an eminently quotable classic of over-the-top ‘80s crime cinema. “The dominant mood of the film is anything but funny,” observed Vincent Canby of the New York Times, one of the few major contemporary critics to praise the film during its initial release. “It is bleak and futile: What goes up must always come down. When it comes down in Scarface, the crash is as terrifying as it is vivid and arresting.”6. Batman Returns (1992)  80%(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)Although he was initially reluctant to film a Batman&nbsp;sequel, director Tim Burton was eventually persuaded to return to Gotham after wresting complete creative control from Warner Bros. The result was 1992’s Batman Returns, a casting dream that found Batman (Michael Keaton, donning the cowl for the final time) facing off against Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer, resplendent in leather) and the Penguin (a scenery-chewing Danny DeVito). Though some critics (and parents) felt the film was too dark, most reviews were positive; in fact, before Christopher Nolan came along with Batman Begins, Batman Returns&nbsp;was the best-reviewed film in the franchise, something Desson Thompson of the Washington Post attributed to the fact that it “comes closer than ever to Bob Kane’s dark, original strip, which began in 1939.”7.&nbsp;The Age of Innocence (1993)  84%(Photo by Columbia Pictures. Courtesy: Everett Collection)With Martin Scorsese in the director’s chair and a cast led by Pfeiffer, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Winona Ryder, 1993’s The Age of Innocence&nbsp;was practically a critical hit even before it arrived in theaters. Add in a screenplay adapted from the Edith Wharton novel about 19th-century star-crossed lovers, and the pundits’ swooning was predictable — but also understandable, given all the delicious drama wrung from Wharton’s story of a nobleman (Day-Lewis) bound by his engagement to one woman (Ryder) even as he pines through the decades for another (Pfeiffer). “I have seen love scenes in which naked bodies thrash in sweaty passion,” mused Roger Ebert, “but I have rarely seen them more passionate than in this movie, where everyone is wrapped in layers of Victorian repression.”8. Frankie &amp; Johnny (1991)  66%(Photo by Paramount/courtesy Everett Collection)Nearly a decade after playing out a very different type of romance in Scarface, Pfeiffer and Al Pacino reunited for Frankie &amp; Johnny, the story of the unlikely bond that develops between a cynical waitress and the ex-con who gets a job in the kitchen at her diner. Despite its starry cast, it was never meant to be blockbuster material; directed by Garry Marshall and adapted by Terrence McNally from his own play, it was much more of an adult-oriented character study that leaned on a talented creative team and veteran leads to explore the ups and downs of new love in the second chapter of one’s life. “Frankie &amp; Johnny gives Pfeiffer and Pacino room to create warm, expansive characters, and it has one element that feels absolutely fresh,” wrote Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman. “It captures the dull romantic ache people can carry around with them for years.”9. Stardust (2007)  76%(Photo by Paramount/courtesy Everett Collection)If you’re in the mood for an effects-fueled fantasy, there are plenty of movies to choose from — but if you’re itching to see one that stars Robert De Niro as a cross-dressing space pirate and Michelle Pfeiffer as a witch, well, there’s only one choice, and that choice is Stardust. This Matthew Vaughn-directed adaptation of the Neil Gaiman novel about a mystical quest to recover a king’s jewel was a little ahead of its time, arriving just before the MCU ramped up demand for colorful films derived from illustrated adventures, but it still did fairly well for itself with critics and audiences, earning largely positive reviews and more than $135 million worldwide. “Stardust&nbsp;lights up the screen with a splendid tale of heroism and romance,” enthused USA Today’s Claudia Puig. “You don’t have to be a fan of fantasies to enjoy its considerable whimsy.”10. Sweet Liberty (1986)  79%Under normal circumstances, any film in which Alan Alda and Michael Caine vie for the affections of a young Michelle Pfeiffer would fall under fantasy or science fiction. Yet 1986’s Sweet Liberty is really a character-driven dramedy about a college professor (Alda, who also wrote and directed) whose initial excitement after selling his historical novel to a film studio fades once the production actually gets rolling — and he realizes his American Revolution story is about to get the Hollywood treatment, complete with copious violence and gratuitous nudity. Not even the seemingly sweet starlet (Pfeiffer) is what she appears to be. In terms of storyline, it isn’t all that different from the type of small-town movie-biz sendup we’ve seen play out in countless other films, but the ingredients make all the difference; as Blake Davis wrote for KFOR, it’s “A sweet, funny comedy about the perils of being a writer and making a movie. An underrated charmer.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Plus, Max, Originals, Carpet, justice, kaiju, monsters, Musicals","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/08175644/Michelle-Pfeiffer-Recall.jpg","slug":"rank-michelle-pfeiffers-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508951457035","title":"Rank Michael Fassbender’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rank Michael Fassbender's 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of The Snowman star.by Jeff Giles | October 18, 2017 |  CommentsFrom critically acclaimed indie flicks to Oscar-nominated dramas and superhero blockbusters, Michael Fassbender has put together an enviably eclectic filmography — one that adds a chilly murder mystery this weekend with Tomas Alfredson’s adaptation of the Jo Nesbø bestseller The Snowman.

While the superheroes headlining this latest Marvel venture may be recognizable to you — Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter), and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) —&nbsp;some of their TV predecessors weren’t so lucky and came and went without much fanfare.Have a look at some TV superheroes you may not recall.AutomanHaving famous parents will give a person a leg-up in show business, but that’s only part of the battle — just ask Desi Arnaz, Jr., whose legendary parents’ prowess wasn’t enough to keep him from starring in Automan, a 13-episode wonder that aired on ABC from late 1983 through the spring of 1984. Following the adventures of unfortunately named cop/computer specialist Walter Nebicher (Arnaz, Jr.) and his AI hologram creation Automan (Chuck Wagner), the show combined corny humor (its second episode was titled “Staying Alive While Running a High Flashdance Fever”) with goofy special effects (Automan’s Tron-inspired suit was made out of special reflective fabric), to negligible results. By summer, he was gone, along with his Autocar and Autochopper.Birds of PreyTaking its inspiration from the DC series of the same name, the WB’s Birds of Prey imagined a Batman-free future for Gotham — one in which three of the city’s strongest women (Barbara Gordon, a.k.a. Oracle, played by Dina Meyer; Helena Kyle, a.k.a. Huntress, played by Ashley Scott; and Dinah Lance, played by Rachel Skarsten) team up to fight crime, assisted by a police detective (Shemar Moore) and, of course, Batman’s manservant Alfred Pennyworth (Ian Abercrombie). The show’s splashy premise made it a popular viewing destination early on, but ratings quickly eroded; after Prey‘s 13-episode first-season run, the network opted not to renew.Black ScorpionAvoiding camp is often a tricky proposition for superhero series; their concepts require such a delicate suspension of disbelief that it can sometimes be easier just to embrace the silly humor inherent in the idea of a costumed crimefighter. The Sci Fi Channel series Black Scorpion is a case in point: Drawing its inspiration from a pair of Roger Corman films and leaning heavy on the exclamation-pointed aesthetic of the 1960s Batman series (right down to hiring special guests Adam West and Frank Gorshin), it starred former Miss Kansas Michelle Lintel as the titular hero, a police detective leading a double life as a masked vigilante. Like Batman, Black Scorpion relied on combat training, cool gear, and impossible gadgets to do her work, which may have been part of why she ended up battling low-budget baddies like Aerobicide (and her sidekicks Bend and Stretch) — and that, in turn, likely had a lot to do with why Black Scorpion lasted only a single 22-episode season before being retired.The CapeIf for no other reason than that its supporting cast included the magnificent Keith David, CBS’s The Cape should have had a long and healthy life on television. Alas, this 2010-11 midseason replacement was quickly doomed by lukewarm reviews and dismal ratings, more than likely the byproduct of a thoroughly convoluted (if still fairly exciting) premise involving an honest cop (David Lyons) framed for murder by a criminal mastermind (James Frain) who thinks he’s killed his patsy — but he’s really only driven him underground, where he’s been schooled in the ways of combat and trickery (as well as outfitted with a nifty cape, ergo the series title) and reborn as a hero hellbent on exposing the crimes of his nemesis. Originally booked for a 13-episode run, The Cape was cut to 10 installments, the last of which was subject to the then-unique indignity of airing only on the network’s website — but it did at least walk away with an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup For A Series, Miniseries, Movie Or A Special.Captain NiceA sort of goofy precursor to The Greatest American Hero with a Captain America twist, 1967’s short-lived Captain Nice followed the clumsy adventures of Carter Nash (William Daniels), a nebbish police chemist who ingests a “super serum” that endows him with special powers (strength, invulnerability, flying) without making him particularly heroic. Garbed in a uniform made and monogrammed by his mother (the incredible Alice Ghostley), Carter Nash becomes Captain Nice and gets himself mixed up in all sorts of goings-on, all while remaining blissfully ignorant of the affections of meter maid Candy Kane (Ann Prentiss). Although it had a solid creative pedigree, springing from the mind of Get Smart co-mastermind Buck Henry, Captain Nice was always campier than funny, and after 15 episodes, NBC had seen enough.Electra Woman and Dyna GirlSid &amp; Marty Kroft, better known for their puppet shows and Land of the Lost, attempted their own superhero show in 1976 with Electra Woman and Dyna Girl. Days of Our Lives’ Diedre Hall and actress Judy Strangis starred the titular Electra-duo. The pair used advanced “Electra” branded devices — like the Electra-Beam and the Electra-Strobe — to fight supervillains while aided by scientist Frank Heflin (Norman Alden) at the ElectraBase. After producing sixteen 12-minute segments for their Saturday morning Kroft Supershow, the Krofts chose not to produce additional material during Supershow’s second season. Forgotten by audiences at large, it was memorable to handful of TV executives, leading to an unaired 2001 WB pilot featuring Night Court’s Markie Post and a 2016 webseries starring Grace Helbig and Hannah Hart.Generation XBefore they feuded over Mutant X, Fox and Marvel teamed up for Generation X, a 1996 TV movie that positioned Banshee (Jeremy Ratchford) and Emma Frost, a.k.a. the White Queen (General Hospital vet Finola Hughes) as the leaders of a Professor X-less Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. Our heroes and their young charges squared off against Russel Tresh (Matt “Max Headroom” Frewer), a mad scientist whose quest to access the “dream dimension” involves scooping brain tissue out of a mutant named Skin (Austin Rodriguez). Bringing superhero action to the screen on a television budget is always a tall order even under the best of circumstances, however, and that problem is compounded when you’re dealing with a script that calls for a large cast bestowed with a dazzling (in theory) array of powers. Toss in a screenplay that gives too many of our teen mutants short shrift and a director who seemed to be actively encouraging Frewer’s hammiest instincts, and it’s no wonder that Generation X hasn’t been followed by future small-screen X-outings (yet).IsisBefore superhero-watchers were treated to Wonder Woman, they got The Secrets of Isis, starring Joanna Cameron as a high school science teacher whose discovery of an ancient amulet during an Egyptian archaeological dig bestows her with the power of the titular goddess. Part of the same Filmation stable that produced its frequent crossover buddy Shazam!, the two-season Saturday morning hit represents peak ’70s superhero action, with a highly permeable fourth wall and loads of kid-directed moral lessons (delivered straight to the camera during each episode’s closing moments) to go along with the many moments of peril defused by Isis’s poetry-prompted powers.Man-ThingUndoubtedly one of the odder heroes to shamble out of the Marvel hivemind during the publisher’s occasionally trippy late 1960s-mid-1970s run, Man-Thing is the unfortunate aftermath of a spy ambush meant to steal the work of a biochemist trying to recreate the “super soldier serum” that created Captain America — when he injects himself with the serum in order to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, then crashes his car into a swamp that also happens to house the Nexus of All Realities, Dr. Ted Sallis mystically merges with the muck to become the virtually indestructible creature who brings burning pain to all those who know fear (in other words, just about anyone who sees a lumbering red-eyed giant in the middle of a swamp). This 2005 TV movie, which originally aired on the Sci Fi Channel, altered vast chunks of the Man-Thing’s origin (Ted Sallis is now a Seminole chieftain rather than a scientist, for starters) and made it more of a murderous beast than an interdimensional guardian, leaving Man-Thing a low-budget horror movie that served as an adaptation of its alleged inspiration pretty much in name only — and a missed opportunity to present a fun, enthusiastically goofy B-movie version of one of Marvel’s cultiest cult favorites.M.A.N.T.I.S.What’s a socially responsible doctor to do after being shot in the spine and paralyzed from the waist down? Well, if you’re Miles Hawkins (played by Carl Lumbly), you dedicate a sizable portion of your considerable wealth to the development of a powerful exoskeleton and other assorted cool gear, you give yourself a secret identity that doubles as a fancy acronym (Mechanically Augmented Neuro Transmitter Interception System, or M.A.N.T.I.S. for short), and you fight crime in a hovercraft between R&amp;R sessions in your secret underwater lab. As M.A.N.T.I.S., Hawkins made life miserable for nemeses like unscrupulous industrialist Solomon Box (Andrew J. Robinson), but the one bad guy he couldn’t defeat was network indifference; Fox pulled the plug on the show before it could make it to a second season, leading to a series finale in which our hero is killed in the line of duty while battling an invisible dinosaur.ManimalFor decades, Manimal served as the butt of jokes whenever NBC wanted to make fun of its own programming choices. Though only the second-worst series the network aired (the worst being the Love Boat wannabe Supertrain), Manimal featured the catchier name and premise. Jaws 3’s Simon MacCorkindale starred as Dr. Jonathan Chase, a man who could change into the shape of any animal the production could afford; typically a hawk or a panther. Teaming up with Detective Brooke Mackenzie (Flash Gordon’s Melody Anderson), Chase used his special abilities to fight crime. The premise failed to excite viewers and was canceled after eight episodes were produced. In fact, Manimal was one of eight new series NBC quickly axed in 1983. Curiously, MacCorkindale would reprise his role as Chase in a 1998 episode of Night Man called “Manimal.”Misfits of ScienceA good-natured, Ghostbusters-inspired paranormal action comedy anchored by Dean Paul Martin, Misfits of Science is notable not only for its eclectic cast — which included a young Courteney Cox, fresh off her big break in Bruce Springsteen’s “Dancing in the Dark” video, as well as future Predator Kevin Peter Hall and ALF‘s sputtering landlord, Max Wright — but for the talent behind the scenes, a group that included first-time writer Tim Kring. Although the show was a pet project of NBC president Brandon Tarkitoff, it was ultimately too expensive to justify continuing in light of low ratings, a casualty of Misfits‘ unenviable position across the schedule from Dallas. After 15 episodes, Science was blinded, although it remains a cult favorite for a small group of devoted fans — for proof, check out Will Harris’s ebook Misfits of Science: An Oral History.Mutant XFox’s ownership of the film and TV rights to Marvel’s X-Men characters enabled the publisher to see some of its heroes on the screen at a time when they weren’t able to adapt those titles themselves, but it has also been a source of persistent complication between the companies — and occasionally the basis for a lawsuit, as was the case when Marvel produced Mutant X, a syndicated series about a bio-geneticist named Adam Kane (John Shea) whose remorse over having helped create a generation of mutants leads him to round up and lead a group of genetically altered heroes on a mission to protect and train mutants at risk of being harmed or exploited. The story possibilities were fairly endless, and the ratings were sufficiently healthy for three full seasons’ worth of episodes, but Fox sued the various companies involved, arguing that Mutant X was a breach of their licensing agreement. Marvel eventually settled out of court, leaving its production partners Tribune Entertainment and Fireworks Entertainment to continue fighting on their own — and when Fireworks went bankrupt, Mutant X died a sudden death.My Secret IdentityThose lucky Canadians, man — not only do they have publicly funded health care, but the Great White North is also home to photon beams that endow teenage boys with superhuman abilities. (This may explain how the guys in Rush are able to rock so hard.) That’s the premise, anyway, behind My Secret Identity, which starred a young Jerry O’Connell as Andrew Clements, a Toronto teen who just happens to be pals with a super-genius scientist (Derek McGrath, a.k.a. Andy Andy from Cheers) who helps him navigate the perils of superpowered puberty. Part of the same block of delightfully ’80s syndicated series that included Out of This World and She’s the Sheriff, My Secret Identity made Saturday afternoons fun for a few years before soaring off into obscurity.Night ManYears after Manimal faded into the annals of misbegotten TV crimefighters, the show’s creator, Glen A. Larson, got a second shot at helping develop a small-screen superhero with Night Man, a syndicated (and loosely Marvel-derived) series about a saxophone player (Matt McColm) who acquires the ability to telepathically detect evil (but is no longer able to sleep) after being struck by lightning. Did we mention that this poor fellow’s name is Johnny Domino? Given its intensely silly premise, visibly low budget, and a supporting cast that briefly included Taylor Dayne, it’s perhaps most surprising that the show managed to last for two seasons, enjoying a 44-episode run (during which Night Man came across Little Richard and Donald Trump as well as Manimal) before disappearing into the darkness.No Ordinary FamilyBefore ABC had access to the Marvel Comics library of characters, it tried to grow its own superhero TV show. The result was not fondly remembered, if recalled at all. The Shield’s Michael Chiklis starred as Jim Powell, the patriarch of a regular California family that survives a plane crash in the Amazon and gains special powers. Once home, they attempted to balance family dysfunctions with their new calling as heroes. Despite being co-created by future Arrow and Flash innovator Greg Berlanti, the show’s sci-fi dramedy format, a strange fit for ABC at the time, bled viewers. Picked up for a full season in October of 2010 thanks to a strong premiere, the order was cut to twenty episodes early the next year and canceled in May of 2011.PowersBased on the comic book by Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Avon Oeming, Powers had the best of intentions, but lacked a wide enough platform to be seen. District 9’s Sharlto Copley starred as Detective Christian Walker, a cop assigned to the LAPD’s Powers Division whose beat included crimes perpetuated by or against extranormal individuals. The first season saw Walker — once a costumed hero himself — investigating his former mentor and facing the temptation to regain his powers. While featuring an interesting premise and a handful of good performances, the production values left a lot to be desired. Also, the show was only available on Sony Playstation consoles via its Playstation Network; severely limiting its availability as a first-run program. A second season was ordered, but Sony soon pulled the plug after the series debuted in May of 2016.Swamp ThingDespite surviving for three seasons, USA’s Swamp Thing aired long before basic cable channels were known for quality original content. The series did little to change that reputation. Stuntman Dick Durock reprised his title role from the Swamp Thing feature films as Alec Holland, a scientist burned and left for dead by the twisted Dr. Anton Arcane (Mark Lindsay Chapman). Instead of dying, he became a supernatural vegetable creature dedicated to keeping the evil men do out of his swamp. Initially campy and family-friendly, the show would become a darker tale after its thirteenth episode. But with episodes aired out of order, and the generally poor quality of writing, the show never amassed more than cult following. Ironically, that following led to some of USA’s best ratings at the time — which gives you an idea of how small cable audiences were thirty years ago. Today, most are surprised to learn that the show ever existed.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"RT21, Critics, 007, breaking, critics, Sabrina, crime, cancelled","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/14141936/RT_Gallery_Forgotten-TV-Supers_600X314.jpg","slug":"forgotten-tv-superheroes"},{"id":"47508953903386","title":"Rank Marisa Tomei’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rank Marisa Tomei's 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Spider-Man: Homecoming star.by Jeff Giles | July 5, 2017 |  CommentsSpider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;swings its way into theaters this weekend, giving filmgoers their first feature-length look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s new version of the friendly neighborhood wall-crawler — and his long-suffering Aunt May, now played by the one and only&nbsp;Marisa Tomei.

Gyllenhaal earned well-deserved praise for his portrayal of Robert Graysmith, the San Francisco Chronicle political cartoonist who helped decipher the Zodiac’s cryptic letters, but despite the film’s overwhelmingly positive critical reception, it was completely overlooked by the Academy Awards. Now that the film is officially 10 years old to the day, we thought it was the perfect time to look back at star Gyllenhaal’s best-reviewed films… including Zodiac.10. The Good Girl (2002)  82%Gyllenhaal ventured into romance — of a sort — with 2002’s The Good Girl, a small-town drama from Chuck &amp; Buck screenwriter Mike White that starred Jennifer Aniston as a morose department store clerk struggling to choose between her unsatisfying marriage and her affair with the unstable, Catcher in the Rye-obsessed co-worker played by Gyllenhaal. Infidelity, dead-end jobs, and small towns are nothing new for the movies — indie films in particular — but however familiar its premise, The Good Girl earned praise from critics thanks to the finely wrought honesty of White’s script and strong performances from Aniston, Gyllenhaal, and their supporting cast (including John C. Reilly, Tim Blake Nelson, and Zooey Deschanel). Taking the cliche of a frustrated young man buried in Holden Caulfield and imbuing it with genuine depth, Gyllenhaal was a major part of why the Hollywood Reporter’s Duane Byrge called it “An absorbing, slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true.”Watch Trailer9. Prisoners (2013)  81%After his 2011 film Incendies earned a heap of acclaim — including a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nod — French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve made his Hollywood debut with a gripping psychological thriller about a desperate man (Hugh Jackman) driven to extreme measures when his young daughter is abducted with her best friend. While much of the film rested on Jackman’s shoulders, he was supported by a stellar cast that included Viola Davis, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, and Jake Gyllenhaal as the skeptical detective whose investigation into the disappearance is beset by false leads and a father obsessed with vigilante justice. The end result was a twisty, twisted mystery that impressed more than a few critics, like USA Today’s Claudia Puig, who noted that “the plot raises complicated moral questions about how far an anguished person will go for the love of a child. At the same time, it sets up an intricate, horrifying mystery with breathtaking skill.”Watch Trailer8. End of Watch (2012)  85%Most critics — and more than a few filmgoers — would agree that the found-footage gimmick has been more than played out since rising to prominence with The Blair Witch Project in the late 1990s. Still, it’s a powerful tool when used in the right way, as demonstrated by writer/director David Ayer’s End of Watch, which follows a cop/film student (Gyllenhaal) and his partner (Michael Pena) on patrol in the mean streets of South Central Los Angeles. While Ayer’s use of the found footage technique certainly proved divisive among critics, End of Watch earned a healthy $51 million at the box office, picked up a pair of Independent Spirit Award nominations, and enjoyed the respect of scribes such as Amy Biancolli of the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote, “The best scenes are filmed inside the cruiser, dashboard shots that face inward instead of out, catching Gyllenhaal and Peña in moments so playful and true they make all other buddy cops look bogus by comparison.”Watch Trailer7. Donnie Darko (2001)  86%Time travel, a falling jet engine, and a dude in a bunny suit: From these disparate ingredients, writer-director Richard Kelly wove the tale of Donnie Darko, a suburban teenager (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) charged with repairing a rift in the fabric of our dimension. Or something. To call Darko “open to interpretation” would be understating the case a bit — it’s been alternately confounding and delighting audiences since it was released in 2001 — but its dense, ambiguous plot found stronger purchase with critics, who cared less about what it all meant than about simply having the chance to see an American movie that took some substantial risks. Though a few reviewers were confused and/or unimpressed (Staci Lynne Wilson of Fantastica Daily called it “derivative,” and Joe Leydon dismissed it as “a discombobulating muddle” in his writeup for the San Francisco Examiner), overall critical opinion proved a harbinger of the cult status the film would eventually enjoy on the home video market; as Thomas Delapa wrote for the Boulder Weekly, “If the sum total of Donnie Darko is hard to figure, there’s no questioning that its separate scenes add up to breathtaking filmmaking.” Despite a paltry $4.1 million gross during its original limited run, Darko returned to theaters in 2004 with a director’s cut — one whose 91 percent Tomatometer actually improved upon the original’s.Watch Trailer6. Lovely &amp; Amazing (2002)  86%Years before he challenged taboos with Brokeback Mountain, Jake Gyllenhaal proved his versatility with script choices like the ones he made in 2001, which found him starring in Donnie Darko, Bubble Boy, and Nicole Holofcener’s Lovely &amp; Amazing. Though Bubble Boy saw the widest release of the three (and some of the harshest reviews of Gyllenhaal’s career), Lovely &amp; Amazing proved he could hold his own with a stellar cast that included Catherine Keener, Emily Mortimer, and Dermot Mulroney — and it proved that he was capable of rising to the challenge of a writer-director known for getting the best out of her actors. Here, Gyllenhaal stars as Jordan, a teenaged one-hour photo developer who earns the adulterous affection of his frustrated (and significantly older) co-worker, played by Catherine Keener. Holofcener’s films are known for focusing on women — and rightly so — but smart dramas need smart performances, and with his empathetic supporting turn here, Gyllenhaal more than held his own. Though it wasn’t a major commercial success, grossing only just over $4.2 million in limited release, Lovely &amp; Amazing enjoyed a number of awards and nominations from critics’ associations, as well as acclaim from scribes such as Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press, who wrote, “For all its dirty talk and up-frontness, this is a family film — it’s about one family and the extended family of females. Any woman who sees it will recognize that, and any man who sees it will be better for it.”Watch Trailer5. Brokeback Mountain (2005)  87%Take a heart-wrenching short story by Annie Proulx, give it to award-winning director Ang Lee, and surround him with a rock-solid cast including Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, and — of course — Jake Gyllenhaal, and you’ve got Brokeback Mountain, one of the most talked-about (and award-winning) movies of 2005. Gyllenhaal and Ledger starred as Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar, a pair of Wyoming ranch hands whose tortured, almost completely unspoken affair has a profound impact on their lives — and the lives of their wives and children — over a period of several decades. Not your everyday Hollywood love story, to put it mildly — and to no one’s surprise, Gyllenhaal and Ledger earned more attention for their characters’ sexuality than for their performances in the roles, with a wide variety of pundits accusing the filmmakers of using Brokeback to further a political agenda; famously, one Utah theater owner canceled his engagement just hours before the first scheduled screening. Underneath all the hubbub, however, shone a beautifully acted love story with uncommon depth and intensity, and both Gyllenhaal and Ledger were richly rewarded for their work with an impressive number of awards and nominations, not to mention a $178 million worldwide gross and reams of critical praise from critics including Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, who wrote, “It has become shorthand to call Brokeback Mountain the ‘gay cowboy movie,’ but it is much more than that glib description implies. This is a human story, a haunting film in the tradition of the great Hollywood romantic melodramas.”Watch Trailer4. Zodiac (2007)  89%In the hands of an ordinary filmmaker, any attempt to tell the story of the Zodiac Killer might have been equal parts conjecture and garden-variety gore — after all, the serial murderer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area for years in the 1960s and 1970s, taunting the police with a series of cryptic letters, eventually disappeared, never to be identified. For director David Fincher, though, the truly interesting story didn’t lie so much with the Zodiac as it did with the men and women who devoted themselves to apprehending him — particularly Robert Graysmith, the San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist who broke the Zodiac’s code and eventually became an asset to the investigation. As the increasingly driven Graysmith, Gyllenhaal led the viewer on a darkening spiral of dead ends, wild goose chases, and grim obsession — and he anchored a showy cast that included Robert Downey, Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Chloe Sevigny, and Anthony Edwards. Unfortunately, the words “David Fincher” and “serial killer drama” sparked hopes that Fincher was returning to his Se7en roots, and the studio’s marketing campaign did nothing to set filmgoers straight; ultimately, despite a strongly positive reaction from critics, Zodiac was a non-starter at the box office, and by the time awards season arrived, this March release was all but forgotten. It deserved better, according to writers like the Toronto Star’s Geoff Pevere, who argued, “It makes you want to study it even more closely, in search of things you might have missed, trailing after leads that flash by in the relentless momentum of going nowhere fast. If you’re not careful, it might make you obsessed.”Watch Trailer3. October Sky (1999)  91%It isn’t often that NASA engineers get their own biopics — but then, most of them don’t have life stories as inspiring as Homer Hickam, the West Virginia native whose Sputnik-fueled fascination with rockets turned him into a teen science fair sensation (and, more importantly, helped him avoid working in the local coalmine). Based on Hickam’s autobiographical novel Rocket Boys, Joe Johnston’s 1999 drama October Sky gave audiences a rare slice of critically acclaimed drama during the cold winter months — and it provided a breakout role for Gyllenhaal, whose biggest credits to that point came through parts in a pair of his father Stephen’s movies and minor appearances in City Slickers and Josh and S.A.M. Though he was surrounded with talented co-stars, it fell to Gyllenhaal to carry the movie as the young Hickam and make audiences believe in not only his wide-eyed wonder at the stars, but his struggles with his distant, unsupportive father (played by Chris Cooper); his success was noted by critics such as Jeff Vice of the Deseret News, who correctly predicted that “Even if October Sky was a complete dud, the drama would still get points for being the movie that launched the career of a new star, Jake Gyllenhaal.”Watch Trailer2. Source Code (2011)  92%It’s a common complaint that there isn’t any room for original ideas in Hollywood anymore, but every so often, we’re treated to a movie like Source Code that proves an exception to the rule. Helmed by Moon director Duncan Jones from a script by Ben Ripley, this twisty sci-fi thriller follows the adventures of a U.S. Army captain (Gyllenhaal) whose latest mission — to prevent a catastrophic bombing on board a moving train — masks a horrible personal tragedy that his support team is keeping from him. Bolstered by a strong support cast that included Vera Farmiga, Michelle Monaghan, and Jeffrey Wright, and topped off by a thought-provoking ending, Source Code earned the applause of critics like the New Yorker’s David Denby, who wrote, “The movie is a formally disciplined piece of work, a triumph of movie syntax, made with a sense of rhythm and pace, and Gyllenhaal, who is always good at conveying anxiety, gives [his] desperation a comic edge.”Watch Trailer1. Nightcrawler (2014)  95%After cutting his teeth writing screenplays for films like The Fall and The Bourne Legacy, Dan Gilroy made his feature directorial debut with Nightcrawler, an uncomfortably tense thriller about a socially awkward man (Gyllenhaal) who finds his calling as an ambulance-chasing freelance videographer. Gilroy spent years reworking his script around the character of Lou Bloom and found a perfect partner in Gyllenhaal, who played an active part in the production of the film, lost nearly 30 pounds for the role, and turned in a powerhouse performance. With help from outstanding supporting players like Rene Russo, Bill Paxton, and Riz Ahmed, Nightcrawler went on to become one of the best-reviewd films of the year and earned Gilroy a Best Original Screenplay nod at the Academy Awards in the process. As Christopher Orr of The Atlantic pointed out, “Gyllenhaal is the same age that De Niro was in Taxi Driver and, like him, he is learning to channel an eerie, inner charisma, offering it up in glimpses and glimmers rather than all at once.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Alien, breaking, tv, globe, australia, Pictures, Starz, Adventures, movie, books, Amazon, stop","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Jake-Gyllenhaal-Source-Code.jpg","slug":"jake-gyllenhaals-best-movies"},{"id":"47508959145276","title":"Danny Glover’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Danny Glover's 10 Best Moviesby Jeff Giles | November 9, 2016 |  CommentsA prolific veteran of the stage and screen, Danny Glover has been a familiar face for generations of moviegoers over the last several decades — and he’s still going strong, as evidenced by his supporting turn in this weekend’s Almost Christmas. In honor of his distinguished and still-growing filmography, we decided to devote this feature to a fond look back at some of its brighter critical highlights, devising a list that’s as eclectic as it is impressive … even without the inclusion of the Lethal Weapon franchise, which averaged out below the cut. Get ready for Total Recall!10.&nbsp;Bopha! (1993)  82%The story of apartheid, at least as told on the silver screen, is one of people on opposing sides of history, with its supporters’ dedication to racially based oppression putting them firmly on the losing end. It’s a worthy story, but one with familiar (albeit no less powerful) contours — which makes it all the more to Morgan Freeman‘s credit that for his 1993 directorial effort Bopha!, he framed the South African conflict through the eyes of a black police officer wholly dedicated to upholding the government. Loyal to the system he’s sworn to protect but understandably conflicted about its racist underpinnings, officer Micah Mangena (Glover) grapples with gnawing self-doubt as the clock runs out on apartheid, surrounded by citizens — and even family members — who view him as a traitor. It all adds up, as Leonard Klady wrote for Variety, to “a handsomely crafted, potently played drama that brings the issue of apartheid down to a visceral human dimension.”Watch Trailer9.&nbsp;Bat 21 (1988)  81%It would be hard to persuasively argue that there aren’t enough war movies — and the Vietnam War was a subject of particularly intense fascination for filmmakers in the ’80s, especially after the outsize success enjoyed by Sylvester Stallone with the First Blood franchise. But Danny Glover and Gene Hackman are capable of enlivening even the most well-trod material, as they proved with 1988’s BAT*21, a fact-based account of a downed colonel’s (Hackman) attempts to get back to friendly territory with the assistance of a pilot (Glover) who risks disciplinary action through his dogged determination to save a fellow soldier. “BAT*21 is an exciting thriller about survival,” wrote Chris Hicks for the Deseret News. “And it also manages to say something about the victims of war, and how distance makes the difference to the soldier.”Watch Trailer8.&nbsp;The Royal Tenenbaums (2002)  81%If you’ve got a movie in which you’ve hired Gene Hackman to play a misanthropic weirdo and you need to cast an actor to play his polar opposite, who do you turn to? Just ask Wes Anderson, whose Royal Tenenbaums cast of outlandish characters was balanced out by Danny Glover as Henry Sherman, the bow-tied accountant whose quiet dependability stands in stark contrast to the psyche-warping megalomania of Hackman’s titular family patriarch. “This comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family of eccentric geniuses is exactly the kind of movie America could use,” wrote Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News. “It’s funny, poignant, laced with irresistibly flawed characters and focuses on the power of love in a family.”Watch Trailer7.&nbsp;Grand Canyon (1991)  77%The early ’90s saw Glover pulling action thriller duty with Predator 2 and the Lethal Weapon franchise, but he still managed to make room for the occasional drama — like Lawrence and Meg Kasdan‘s Grand Canyon, which blended a starry ensemble for a thoughtful look at race and class in Los Angeles at the dawn of the decade. Playing a tow truck driver whose well-timed arrival to pick up a client (Kevin Kline) sets the plot in motion, Glover shared screen time with a cast that also included Steve Martin, Alfre Woodard, and Mary-Louise Parker, and although the movie wasn’t a major box office hit, it touched on themes and narrative techniques that would resonate throughout the decade and beyond. “It maps these dark, desperate, fearful times with comic and terrifying veracity,” wrote Joe Brown for the Washington Post, “and holds out a glimmer of hope for the soul-searching survivors of the ’90s.”Watch Trailer6.&nbsp;Beyond the Lights (2014)  83%It might seem like Danny Glover’s been on the big screen less often lately, but he’s really working more than ever, cranking out six or seven movies a year — and picking some pretty good scripts along the way, as evidenced by his NAACP Image Award-nominated work in 2014’s Beyond the Lights. Appearing in a supporting role, Glover played the police captain father of male lead Kaz Nicol (Nate Parker), a young police officer whose budding romance with a troubled pop star (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) prompts some stern paternal advice — and helps ground a picture that flirts with glitzy melodrama but ultimately sticks the landing. As Bilge Ebiri wrote for Vulture, “How bracing today to have a film that’s at once fun, patient, romantic, and real.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;5.&nbsp;The Rainmaker (1997)  82%Glover was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for his work in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Rainmaker, a critical and commercial hit whose success proved that in the right hands, even a bestseller from an author perceived as a lightweight can make for compelling cinema. Matt Damon toplined as Rudy Baylor, a young and (at least temporarily) naive law school grad who ends up filing a lawsuit against a shady insurance company, and Coppola put him in very good company, surrounded the young star with a supporting cast that included Glover (playing a judge who takes over the case), Danny DeVito, Jon Voight, Roy Scheider, Mickey Rourke, and Claire Danes. Critics might have gone in expecting something that would live down to Grisham’s lowbrow reputation, but they came away pleasantly surprised — as Madeleine Williams of Cinematter observed, “With numerous entertaining subplots, plenty of well thought-out characters, brought to life by talented actors, and an invigorating trial, what more do you want from a Grisham film?”Watch Trailer4.&nbsp;To Sleep With Anger (1990)  88%One of the less discovered entries in Danny Glover’s filmography, To Sleep with Anger is also one of the more distinctively enjoyable — and a rare showcase for Glover’s gifts in a leading role. He stars here as Harry Mention, a traveler whose past with married couple Gideon (Paul Butler) and Suzie (Mary Alice), earns him lodging in their Los Angeles home when he passes into town on his way to San Francisco. Their good deed doesn’t go unpunished, as Harry’s arrival immediately begins wreaking potentially supernatural havoc on the lives of everyone around them — all stemming from Harry’s seemingly innocuous yet ultimately malevolent presence. Glover won an Independent Spirit Award for his portrayal of the interloper, along with praise from critics like the Washington Post’s Rita Kempley, who called the movie “A universal look at familial dynamics, articulated from a uniquely black, warmly poetic perspective.”Watch Trailer3.&nbsp;The Color Purple (1985)  81%Glover’s mid-’80s hot streak reached its arguable zenith with a major role in 1985’s The Color Purple, a prestige project from blockbuster savant Steven Spielberg that united an incredible cast in service of Alice Walker’s Pulitzer-winning novel about an African-American woman’s experiences in the rural South during the early years of the 20th century. Defying pundits who suspected Spielberg lacked the gravitas to tell a serious story — or who took issue with a white director telling a story pulled from the pages of black American history — Purple reaped nearly universal critical acclaim, made more than $140 million at the U.S. box office, and racked up 11 Oscar nominations. “It is a great, warm, hard, unforgiving, triumphant movie,” wrote Roger Ebert, “and there is not a scene that does not shine with the love of the people who made it.”Watch Trailer2.&nbsp;Witness (1985)  93%Glover hasn’t played a lot of really bad guys in his career, but with 1985’s Witness, he took on a doozy — a crooked cop who’s not only out to put the hurt on Harrison Ford for ratting him out to a superior, but willing to kill a young Amish boy who happened to witness (get it?) his murder of an undercover officer. Ford’s character, wounded after being attacked by Glover, recuperates in the care of the boy’s community, setting up a tense thriller that unfolds against a fish-out-of-water tale and a love story with Kelly McGillis — as well as one of the year’s bigger critical and commercial hits. The end result, as Filmcritic’s Pete Croatto argued, “takes a high concept idea and turns it into a character study more suspenseful and more rewarding than the anticipated norm.”Watch Trailer1.&nbsp;Places in the Heart (1984)  89%Glover scored his first substantial role in a major picture with Places in the Heart, playing a handyman who latches on with a widow (Sally Field, who won a Best Actress Oscar) struggling to keep her Texas farm afloat during the Great Depression. The kind of film whose plot doesn’t seem to cover a lot of ground, but which deals with some unmistakably weighty themes (in this case racism, adultery, and family commitment), Places in the Heart wasn’t necessarily one of the most exciting pictures of the year, but it was an Academy favorite — Field’s Best Actress win prompted her oft-lampooned “you like me” speech — and a source of admiration for critics like Vincent Canby of the New York Times, who wrote, “Out of the memories of his boyhood in Waxahachie, Tex., during the Great Depression, and within the unlikely tradition of the old-fashioned ‘mortgage’ melodrama, Robert Benton has made one of the best films in years about growing up American.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Wars, Pictures, die, crime, Comic, GoT, See, streaming, Grammys, streaming, Tyler, indie, service, Red","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/09120738/Danny-Glover.jpg","slug":"danny-glovers-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508959164735","title":"10 Awesome Movie Accountants","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Awesome Movie AccountantsIn this week's Total Recall, we look at a surprisingly eclectic collection of accountants on the big screen, where they don't show up all too often.by Jeff Giles | October 12, 2016 |  CommentsMere months after he helped expand the DCEU in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Ben Affleck is back in The Accountant, an action thriller about a guy whose affinity for numbers leads him into some fairly dangerous legal gray areas. In honor of a rare (albeit probably pretty unrealistic) trip to the big screen for this profession, we decided to dedicate this week’s feature to other accountants at the movies — and we turned up a bigger and more varied bunch than you might immediately suspect. It’s time for Total Recall!William Blake – Dead Man (1995)  71%Long before he rode as Tonto in Disney’s Lone Ranger, Johnny Depp starred in a very different kind of Western: Jim Jarmusch’s endearingly odd Dead Man. Playing William Blake, an accountant who travels to a frontier town to start a new job only to find it’s been given away — and then bumbles into a murder that sends him into the wilderness with a bullet in his chest and a Native American guide named Nobody — Depp got to indulge some of his odder arthouse inclinations while exposing viewers to a number of heretofore unconsidered occupational hazards in the field. “This is clearly a turning point for the director,” wrote the Austin Chronicle’s Marc Savlov. “To where he’s turning, though, is anyone’s guess.”Frank Bigelow – D.O.A. (1950)  88%This 1950 noir classic rests on a premise so rich and sturdy that it’s been remade a number of times (to admittedly diminishing returns): Accountant Frank Bigelow (Edmond O’Brien) books himself a nice one-week vacation to San Francisco, only to end up being poisoned by an unknown assailant. As the movie opens, he’s entering a police station — to report his own murder. Racing against the clock and determined to find out who killed him, Bigelow uses his methodical intellect to piece together the events surrounding his poisoning, unspooling a series of twists and double-crosses along the way. “It stands,” wrote David Cornelius for eFilmCritic, “as one of the finest of the post-war B thrillers.”Louis Tully – Ghostbusters (1984 Original) (1984)  97%Imagine Hollywood’s stereotypical version of an accountant, and the picture that comes to mind is probably a little like Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), the track-suited nebbish whose fumbling attempts to put the moves on Dana (Sigourney Weaver) offer the paranormal goings-on in Ghostbusters a little added comic relief. In a lot of ways, the character’s played as your average two-dimensional ’80s comedy nerd, but to his credit, Louis obviously had a healthy social life outside the office — and he got to unleash his inner beast toward the end, after he was possessed by Vinz Clortho. Austin Kennedy of Film Geek Central spoke for a generation when he wrote, “Ghostbusters&nbsp;is a movie that I’ve seen well over a hundred times and I’m still not sick of it, nor do I think I ever will.”Jonathan Mardukas – Midnight Run (1988)  94%What’s riskier for an accountant than ripping off a client? Swindling a mobster client out of $15 million — as evidenced by the furtive journey undertaken by Charles Grodin’s character in Midnight Run. As Jonathan “The Duke” Mardukas, Grodin spends the movie on the lam from a number of interested parties, including his former client (Dennis Farina), the bail bondsman he left holding the bag (Joe Pantoliano), and Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro), the bounty hunter hired to catch him. Nine times out of 10, this story would end up being an action thriller, but Midnight Run&nbsp;played it largely for laughs — and fortunately for director Martin Brest, they made a pretty terrific comedy duo. “Whoever cast De Niro and Grodin must have had a sixth sense for the chemistry they would have,” wrote Roger Ebert. “They work together so smoothly, and with such an evident sense of fun, that even their silences are intriguing.”Loretta Castorini – Moonstruck (1987)  94%Audiences love a good romantic odd couple — and what’s odder than Nicolas Cage as an absurdly coiffed, incurably romantic, prosthetic-fingered baker opposite Cher as a buttoned-down accountant? Director Norman Jewison paired the stars to tremendous effect in 1987’s Moonstruck, using their unlikely chemistry to fuel a star-crossed romantic comedy whose admittedly rather basic story took a backseat to the effervescent energy of its leads. As the Chicago Reader’s Jonathan Rosenbaum put it, “most of the show belongs to Cher and Cage, both of whom are at their energetic best.”Leo Bloom – The Producers (1968)  90%Every dastardly business plan needs an accountant with flexible morals, and The Producers&nbsp;got a great one in Leo Bloom. Played in Mel Brooks’ 1968 movie classic by Gene Wilder, Bloom’s the numbers wiz who hips foundering Broadway producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) to the idea that he can make money by over-investing a flop play and pocketing the difference — inadvertently sparking the deranged (and utterly hilarious) idea to mount a production of Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden. “If Mel Brooks is remembered for only three films, then he can rest easy knowing that they’re three of the funniest ones ever made,” wrote Scott Weinberg for DVD Talk. “And The Producers&nbsp;was the first.”Henry Sherman – The Royal Tenenbaums (2002)  81%If you’ve got a movie in which you’ve hired Gene Hackman to play a misanthropic weirdo and you need to cast an actor to play his polar opposite, who do you turn to? Just ask Wes Anderson, whose The&nbsp;Royal Tenenbaums cast of outlandish characters was balanced out by Danny Glover as Henry Sherman, the bow-tied accountant whose quiet dependability stands in stark contrast to the psyche-warping megalomania of Hackman’s titular family patriarch. “This comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family of eccentric geniuses is exactly the kind of movie America could use,” wrote Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News. “It’s funny, poignant, laced with irresistibly flawed characters and focuses on the power of love in a family.”Itzhak Stern –&nbsp;Schindler's List (1993)  98%We’ve all heard about Oskar Schindler’s heroic, costly efforts to save Jewish refugees during World War II. But those who have merely passing familiarity with this dark chapter in history may not know Schindler’s life-saving list had a crucial assist from Itzhak Stern, the accountant who helped run his factory. Played in Schindler’s List by BAFTA-nominated Ben Kingsley, Stern adds another anguished pulse to this Spielberg classic — and ably demonstrates how history’s course was altered by a guy who used a balance sheet to help protect the dignity of human life. Applauding the director for “rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence,” the New York Times’ Janet Maslin wrote, “Mr. Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again.”Andy Dufresne – The Shawshank Redemption (1994)  91%The stereotype of an accountant’s life is quiet and rather dull — a picture cruelly upended by the case of poor Andy Dufresne in The Shawshank Redemption. Framed for a crime of passion he didn’t commit and railroaded into the state pen, Andy (played by Tim Robbins) saves himself from a life of prison brutality with his financial acumen, which earns him a gig crunching numbers and laundering money for the warden. Even more impressive than his way with a ledger sheet? The unyielding patience that enables him to put up with years of injustice while slowly carving a tunnel out of the prison, spoonful by spoonful. “This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film,” wrote Dave Kehr for the New York Daily News, “with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.”Oscar Wallace – The Untouchables (1987)  83%It’s fun to frame the story of Eliot Ness vs. Al Capone as a good old-fashioned cops ‘n’ robbers saga, but it wasn’t just badges and bullets that toppled the infamous gangster’s criminal empire — it was tax evasion. With 1987’s The Untouchables, director Brian De Palma dramatized Capone’s fall by rounding up an all-star cast that included Kevin Costner as Ness, Robert De Niro as Capone, and Sean Connery as straight-arrow cop Jimmy Malone, and although it’s their pistol-toting mugs glowering out from the movie poster, the story really starts with a different kind of tough guy: accountant Oscar Wallace, played by American Graffiti&nbsp;vet Charles Martin Smith. Outside the numbers, of course, the movie packs in its share of excitement; as Ben Yagoda wrote for the Philadelphia Daily News, “De Palma does a superb job with the action sequences, which are choreographed, paced and acted out so well that they don’t leave a palm dry in the house.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"movie, Sundance, See, video, Kids, Go, Amazon, ITV, series, Nominations, of, YouTube, Mary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/12151038/Accountants-Recall.jpg","slug":"10-awesome-movie-accountants"},{"id":"47508958972210","title":"Matthew McConaughey’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Matthew McConaughey's 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Gold star.by Jeff Giles | January 25, 2017 |  CommentsNot so very long ago, Matthew McConaughey appeared doomed to join the Hollywood scrap heap of handsome guys who just don’t have a reliable knack for picking the right script, but these days, it seems like everything he touches turns to cinematic gold — and with a starring role in this weekend’s&nbsp;Gold, McConaughey&nbsp;hopes to continue that streak. With that in mind, we decided to devote this week’s list to a look back at his ever-more-impressive filmography, so settle in: all right, all right, all right, it’s time for Total Recall!10. Frailty (2002)  74%It’s a lot easier to shock viewers and/or gross them out than to truly scare them, which is one of the reasons why fans of smart, low-key horror movies don’t often have a lot to choose from at the cineplex — and why when exceptions to the rule arrive, like Bill Paxton’s deviously creepy Frailty, they aren’t afforded the level of marketing muscle that your average slasher might enjoy. Still, even if it’s something of a cult classic, this tale of a deranged religious fanatic (Paxton) indoctrinating his sons into his cult of “demon-slaying” — told through flashbacks relayed to an FBI agent (Powers Boothe) by a mysterious narrator (McConaughey) — it won the immediate admiration of a long list of critics that includes the Village Voice’s Michael Atkinson, who wrote, “If Frailty isn’t quite the devastation it could’ve been … it remains the most pungent American-Pentecostal mini-nightmare since 1996’s true-crime doc Paradise Lost.”Watch Trailer9. Amistad (1997)  77%A year after making his big breakthrough in Joel Schumacher’s A Time to Kill, McConaughey proved he had more than popcorn movies on his mind with his performance as attorney Roger Sherman Baldwin in Amistad, Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-nominated account of the U.S. Supreme Court battle that erupted in 1841 after a slave ship was impounded by the American military following a successful revolt by its unwilling cargo. Compelling not just as a human rights drama, the story has enough real-life intrigue to fill up several films — including former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) coming out of retirement to help argue the slaves’ case, to the chagrin of pro-slavery President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne). As impeccably mounted and impressively cast as you’d expect of any Spielberg prestige production, Amistad picked up four Oscar nominations, and if a handful of critics felt its epic sweep was at odds with the true story’s historical facts, the majority were too busy applauding to nitpick. “As Spielberg vehicles go,” argued USA Today’s Susan Wloszczyna, “Amistad — part mystery, action thriller, courtroom drama, even culture-clash comedy — lands between the disturbing lyricism of Schindler’s List and the storybook artificiality of The Color Purple.”Watch Trailer8. Killer Joe (2012)  79%The third entry in McConaughey’s trifecta of critical hits in 2012, Killer Joe found Exorcist director William Friedkin snapping a long dry streak with a story the poster’s tagline described as “a totally twisted deep-fried Texas redneck trailer park murder story.” That’s a lot to live up to, but as far as most critics were concerned, Joe stuck the landing, rounding up a suitably killer cast — led by McConaughey as a cop-slash-contract killer hired by a drug dealer (Emile Hirsch) who schemes to off his own mother in order to get at her insurance money — in service of seedy, seamy NC-17 thrills. “Watching Killer Joe to the bitter end is like playing the Pick 6 lottery and getting three of the numbers right,” chuckled Joe Williams for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “You don’t win anything, but you still think you’re smarter than all those other idiots.”Watch Trailer7. Magic Mike (2012)  79%Of all the critical smashes in Matthew McConaughey’s filmography, Magic Mike will probably always be the most unlikely; generally speaking, movies about strippers tend to inspire derision, not sequels. Here’s the happy exception to that rule, a dramedy about a humble dancer with big dreams (Channing Tatum) who teams up with a beefcake buddy (Alex Pettyfer) on his way to what he hopes will be a bright future as the owner of his own business — if he can just save enough money to be able to give notice to his boss (McConaughey) at the local strip joint. Smoothly directed by Steven Soderbergh and rounded out with a capable supporting cast that included Joe Manganiello and Olivia Munn, Magic Mike transcended its shallow-seeming premise to offer crowd-pleasing yet thought-provoking entertainment; as Owen Gleiberman wrote for Entertainment Weekly, the movie “has a conventional structure, yet a teasing question percolates beneath: If selling yourself is as much fun as this movie makes it look, what could be wrong with it?”Watch Trailer6. The Lincoln Lawyer (2011)  83%Fifteen years after he caught an early career break by playing a lawyer in the John Grisham adaptation A Time to Kill, McConaughey returned to the courtroom for an altogether different kind of legal drama. Based on Michael Connelly’s novel of the same name, The Lincoln Lawyer follows a pivotal case for Mickey Haller, a small-time attorney who maintains his practice out of the back of a town car. If the end result didn’t really break any new ground for McConaughey or the courtroom film genre in general, it still represented a solid step back from the rom-com brink for its star, while giving him an opportunity to play just the sort of rakishly charming ne’er-do-well that’s so well-suited to his Newmanesque appeal. “The Lincoln Lawyer is not a feat of genre-breaking design,” admitted the Denver Post’s Lisa Kennedy. “But it is a well-oiled machine.”Watch Trailer5. Bernie (2012)  88%Usually, a movie that depicts a district attorney doggedly pursuing a conviction against a man who killed a little old lady will present the lawyer as the hero and the killer as the villain. Not so Bernie, which found director Richard Linklater telling the exceedingly weird real-life tale of a Texas man (Jack Black) whose eccentric relationship with a wealthy widow (Shirley MacLaine) ended in her death and his trial for murder — a trial that the local DA (McConaughey) had to petition the bench to move due to the accused’s widespread popularity in the town where the killing occurred. Stranger than fiction and darkly amusing, the movie wowed critics while upending expectations; as Tara Brady cautioned for the Irish Times, “It looks like a Southern Gothic and feels like a particularly hilarious farce, but Bernie is not at all what you think.”Watch Trailer4. Lone Star (1996)  94%Writer-director John Sayles earned an Oscar nomination for his work on Lone Star, which employs an outstanding ensemble cast — including Chris Cooper as a Texas sheriff investigating an old murder, Elizabeth Peña as his recently rekindled old flame, and McConaughey as Cooper’s father (in flashbacks, naturally) — to plumb the depths of small-town secrets, betrayal, and that ever-testy father-son dynamic. It’s built from fairly familiar stuff, in other words, but very skillfully; as Kim Newman wrote for Empire, “Like all the best Westerns, this is at once a morality play about individual responsibility and a challenging essay about American history. You’ll watch this for the third or fourth time and see fresh material. Outstanding.”Watch Trailer3. Dazed and Confused (1993)  92%Plenty of filmmakers have sought inspiration in the shiftless glory days of idle youth, and from a distance, Richard Linklater’s Dazed and Confused may have seemed like just another one of those movies about kids entering, leaving, or wishing they’d never left high school when it bowed in theaters during the fall of 1993. As any member of its ever-expanding cult can attest, however, Linklater’s take on the suburban adolescent experience is sharper and more empathetic than the rest — and although it’s a finely detailed period piece set in the 1970s, its themes are timeless enough to resonate with anyone who’s ever experienced the thrill and unearned ennui of youth. It’s also remarkably well cast, and because this is his list, we’ll single out McConaughey’s memorable turn as the cheerfully scuzzy, catchphrase-spawning David Wooderson for particular praise — as did the Austin Chronicle’s Marjorie Baumgarten, saying, “He is a character we’re all too familiar with in the movies, but McConaughey nails this guy without a hint of condescension or whimsy, claiming this character for all time as his own.”Watch Trailer2.&nbsp;Dallas Buyers Club (2013)  93%Nothing screams “for your consideration” like an actor physically transforming himself for a role, to the point that it’s become something of a signal for filmgoers cynical enough to be suspicious of a star’s motivations when taking a part. But as often as not, that commitment pays off; just ask Matthew McConaughey, whose rather frightening pre-shooting regimen included dropping nearly 50 pounds to portray Ron Woodroof, the man whose gut-wrenching and inspiring real-life story forms the heart of Dallas Buyers Club. Academy voters heard those “for your consideration” screams, affording the movie six nominations — three of which it won, including Best Actor for McConaughey and Best Supporting Actor for his co-star Jared Leto. “Just about everything is right with Dallas Buyers Club,” wrote Steven Rea for the Philadelphia Inquirer, “beginning with Matthew McConaughey’s literally transformative portrayal.”Watch Trailer1. Mud (2013)  97%McConaughey has fired off an impressive string of critically lauded pictures since spending the early aughts frittering away his early buzz on stuff like Failure to Launch and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past — perhaps none more impressive than Mud, writer-director Jeff Nichols’ sparkling Southern Gothic about a mysterious man (McConaughey) whose discovery by a pair of kids on a Mississippi island presages a series of events that’s part thriller, part coming-of-age drama, and (according to most critics), all wonderful. TIME’s Mary Corliss summed up the poetic rapture felt by many of her colleagues, writing, “Glorious vision of youth and truth, love and loss, your name is Mud.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"media, TV+, hard, golden, Amazon, nightmare, independent, Dark, Freeform","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Matthew-McConaughey.jpg","slug":"matthew-mcconaugheys-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508959135035","title":"Billy Bob Thornton’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Billy Bob Thornton's 10 Best MoviesWe look back at the best-reviewed work of the Bad Santa 2 star.by Jeff Giles | November 23, 2016 |  CommentsActor, writer, director, recording artist: there’s nothing Billy Bob Thornton can’t do, including bringing a sequel to a cult comedy to the screen over a decade after the original played in theaters. In celebration of the latter achievement, playing out in this weekend’s Bad Santa 2, we turn our attention to Mr. Thornton’s estimable filmography, whose critical highlights boast eclectic riches you may not suspect. It’s time for Total Recall!10. Primary Colors (1998)  81%Based on a thinly fictionalized account of the 1992 presidential campaign written by Joe Klein (who hid, for a time, behind the nom de plume “Anonymous”), and featuring cameos by Geraldo Rivera, Charlie Rose, Larry King, and Bill Maher as themselves, 1998’s&nbsp;Primary Colors&nbsp;could easily have been overshadowed by the real-life circus that followed Bill Clinton’s administration during both of his terms — but director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Elaine May had been a creative team for decades, and their comfort with one another, as well as a terrific cast, made Colors&nbsp;one of the better-reviewed films of the year. Thornton, tasked with providing a caricature of Democratic strategist James Carville that was still layered enough to make sense in an ostensibly grounded drama, passed with flying colors; as Stanley Kauffmann wrote for the New Republic, “Sheerly as film, Primary Colors&nbsp;generally sizzles.”Watch Trailer9. Chrystal (2004)  80%As a guy who habitually writes and directs his own movies, perhaps Billy Bob Thornton is predisposed to have a soft spot for films led by triple-threat talents — or maybe he just appreciated Chrystal, the 2004 directorial debut from actor-screenwriter Ray McKinnon, on its own merits. Either way, this drama about an Arkansas ex-con (Thornton) grappling with the painful aftereffects of his crimes earned a number of positive reviews during its limited release; despite its dark themes, wrote Duane Byrge of the Hollywood Reporter, the movie comes across as “A grand story of redemption, laced with barbecued wit and slopped with intrigue.”Watch Trailer8. The Man Who Wasn't There (2001)  81%The Coen brothers went neo-noir for 2001’s The Man Who Wasn’t There, drafting a stellar batch of character actors (including Thornton, Richard Jenkins, Tony Shalhoub, and Frances McDormand) to tell the story of a barber (Thornton) whose placid-seeming suburban post-WWII existence unravels into a crazy tangle of blackmail, murder, and one very precocious teenage girl (Scarlett Johansson). The black-and-white Man&nbsp;failed to make much of an impression at the box office, but it enthralled critics like ReelViews’ James Berardinelli, who praised it as “An unconventional, unpredictable thriller that Hitchcock probably would have enjoyed.”Watch Trailer7. Friday Night Lights (2004)  82%Before it was an acclaimed cult favorite on the TV dial, Friday Night Lights&nbsp;was a Buzz Bissinger non-fiction book about life on the Texas high school gridiron — and then it was a Peter Berg drama starring Billy Bob Thornton as a football coach with the weight of a small town’s hopes and dreams on his program’s shoulders. In hindsight, it seems awfully easy to say Lights was always destined to play out more powerfully on the small screen, but the film stands up pretty well on its own; as Michael O’Sullivan wrote for the Washington Post, “The movie is full of both crushing disappointment and hope, resignation and joy, ugliness and great beauty.”Watch Trailer6. Daddy and Them (2001)  86%Thornton and Miramax enjoyed a fairly fruitful relationship (see Sling Blade), but the industry is always changing — as are studio fortunes. You’d think the guy who won an Oscar for writing, directing, and starring in Sling Blade&nbsp;would have a blank check, but 2001’s Daddy and Them&nbsp;— made for a paltry $4 million — barely eked out a limited release before heading off to DVD. As far as critics were concerned, it was a shame: starring Thornton and Laura Dern as an Arkansas couple embroiled in family drama after his uncle gets carted off to the hoosegow for attempted murder, it earned praise from scribes such as Variety’s Edie Cockrell, who wrote, “Beneath its deadpan and often absurdist exterior, Daddy and Them&nbsp;feels like a very personal piece of work about how family really does come first, warts and all.”Watch Trailer5. Monster's Ball (2002)  85%There are dark indie dramas, and then there’s Monster’s Ball. Starring Halle Berry as a widow raising her child after the death of her husband — and Thornton as the former prison guard who strikes up an affair with her after helping supervise his execution — it’s a film whose characters are flawed to the point that most of them spend much of the film doing awful things to the few who aren’t&nbsp;predisposed toward unspeakable cruelty. But if it didn’t leave most viewers feeling fuzzy inside, Ball&nbsp;was certainly warmly received: Berry won a Best Actress Oscar for her work, and Arizona Republic critic Bill Muller echoed the thoughts of many of his peers when he called it “A textbook example of fearless filmmaking, exhibiting a brand of gritty realism that’s hard to watch but impossible to ignore.”Watch Trailer4. A Simple Plan (1998)  91%Are people inherently good or evil, or are their morals and ethics driven by the choices available to them? That’s the devilishly grim question at the heart of Sam Raimi’s A Simple Plan, an adaptation of the Scott Smith book about a pair of brothers (played by Thornton and Bill Paxton) who happen upon a downed plane full of cash during a hunting expedition with a friend (Brent Briscoe). One secret and one lie seem like a small price to pay for a $4.4 million windfall split three ways, but their simple plan begins to unravel surprisingly quickly, making the trio — and, by extension, the audience — helpless witnesses to an increasingly gruesome tumble into darkness. “A&nbsp;Simple Plan&nbsp;is a suspenseful, unnerving movie that ranks as one of the best thrillers in recent years,” marveled Mike McGranaghan for Aisle Seat. “The plot and characters converge nicely, and by the end, you are left to wonder how much money is enough to entice you to sell your soul.”Watch Trailer3. The Apostle (1998)  90%Two years after Robert Duvall appeared in Billy Bob Thornton’s labor of love Sling Blade, Thornton repaid the favor, taking on a role as a town resident whose views and temperament threaten to cause problems for Duvall’s titular man of the cloth. Like Sling Blade, The Apostle&nbsp;found its leading man working behind the camera, directing from his own screenplay — and also like Thornton’s film, Duvall’s passion project united an unusual but well-seasoned ensemble that included Miranda Richardson, Farrah Fawcett, June Carter Cash, and Walton Goggins. The result, wrote Roger Ebert, “is like a lesson in how movies can escape from convention and penetrate the hearts of rare characters.”Watch Trailer2. Sling Blade (1996)  96%Thornton had been around for awhile by the time he made Sling Blade, but it really marks the spot where he became a known quantity for moviegoers — and for power players in Hollywood, who sat up and took notice when it turned into an Oscar-winning sleeper hit. He wrote, directed, and starred in the rural-set drama, which centers on a developmentally disabled man who returns to his hometown years after being institutionalized for murdering his mother and her lover; not exactly cheerful stuff, but it was a story that resonated with filmgoers through its telling — and partly thanks to an eclectic cast that also included Robert Duvall, John Ritter, and Dwight Yoakam. “The lure of Sling Blade&nbsp;is both elemental and hauntingly familiar,” wrote Film.com’s Tom Keogh, “and I would not be surprised if Thornton’s breakthrough film is one day considered a classic in its own right.”Watch Trailer1. One False Move (1992)  94%Its commercial prospects were fatally hobbled by a lack of studio faith so profound that it wasn’t even originally supposed to have a theatrical release, but thanks to overwhelmingly positive reviews, 1992’s One False Move&nbsp;— starring Thornton as the ringleader of a gang of criminals that runs afoul of an Arkansas sheriff (Bill Paxton) who teaches them a thing or two about small-town justice — ended up sneaking into theaters long enough for Gene Siskel to call it his favorite movie of the year. Siskel’s enthusiasm for the Carl Franklin-directed thriller was shared by the majority of his peers, including Michael Upchurch of the Seattle Times, who enthused, “Franklin’s convincing portrait of life on both sides of the color line isn’t quite like anything I’ve come across before, making One False Move&nbsp;one very assured directorial move. We need more filmmakers like him.”Watch TrailerWatch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Writers, visit, Oscars, kaiju, spinoff, Lifetime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/22172650/Billy-Bob-Thornton-Recall.jpg","slug":"billy-bob-thorntons-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508959151421","title":"Benedict Cumberbatch’s Best-Reviewed Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Benedict Cumberbatch's Best-Reviewed MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at the Doctor Strange star's most acclaimed films.by Jeff Giles | November 2, 2016 |  CommentsBenedict Cumberbatch shoulders the weight of a Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise with this weekend’s Doctor Strange&nbsp;— a critical winner whose box-office ascension seems all but certain to complete its leading man’s journey from arthouse dramas to full-fledged blockbusters. To celebrate Mr. Cumberbatch’s latest feat, we decided to dedicate this feature to a fond look back at some of the brightest critical highlights from a distinguished (and still growing) filmography. You know what that means: by the hoary hosts of Hoggoth, it’s time for Total Recall!10. Amazing Grace (2007)  67%Before he started taking roles in blockbusters like Star Trek Into Darkness, The Hobbit, and Doctor Strange, if you thought about Benedict Cumberbatch, you were probably thinking of a movie like 2007’s Amazing Grace. Directed by Michael Apted, this historical drama recounts the anti-slavery efforts of British parliament member William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd), whose long campaign to introduce legislation outlawing human trafficking made him a political pariah — and an inspiration to friends and contemporaries like William Pitt the Younger (Cumberbatch). “As square as this movie is,” argued David Denby for the New Yorker, “it has been made with eloquence and jaunty high spirits, and it tells a good story that is virtually unknown here.”Watch Trailer9. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013)  74%Peter Jackson set a new standard for epic fantasies when he adapted The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;into a blockbuster trilogy, leaving himself some big shoes to fill when he set about turning The Hobbit&nbsp;into a three-film saga of its own. It stands to reason that critics and audiences weren’t quite as enchanted the second time around, but this saga — in which Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) joins the wizard Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) on a quest to help reclaim a mountain from a dragon named Smaug (a mo-capped Cumberbatch) — held up reasonably well in its own right, particularly the second installment that focused on Bilbo’s confrontation with Smaug himself. “For many,” warned the Arizona Republic’s Kerry Lengel, “Jackson’s Hobbit&nbsp;will look like an overly long amusement-park attraction. But for fantasy fans who have dreamed all their lives of spending time inside Tolkien’s dazzling alternative reality, it’s a ride well worth taking.”Watch Trailer8. Black Mass (2015)  73%He was born in London, which wouldn’t seem to make him the most natural fit to play the brother of an infamous Boston gangster — but if you’ve watched Benedict Cumberbatch’s performance as Billy Bulger in Black Mass, you know he can pull it off. In fact, although there’s really no shortage of movies about or inspired by the criminal exploits of Whitey Bulger, this relatively late arrival managed to hold its own, thanks in no small part to the efforts of a starry ensemble cast led by Johnny Depp and rounded out by a roster that included Joel Edgerton, Kevin Bacon, and Dakota Johnson. “The acting here is much stronger and more soulful than I would have expected,” admitted Grantland’s Wesley Morris, “and not only from Depp.”Watch Trailer7. War Horse (2011)  74%He wasn’t exactly a neophyte by 2011, but that’s the year his Hollywood star really started to rise, with appearances in front of American audiences courtesy of his roles in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&nbsp;and Steven Spielberg’s War Horse. As reflected by its name, the entire human cast essentially played second fiddle to its equine lead — but this adaptation of Michael Morpurgo’s 1982 children’s novel still lined up some pretty spectacular stars. Exactly the sort of beautifully filmed period drama you’d expect given its behind-the-scenes pedigree and Christmas Day release date, War Horse&nbsp;follows the astonishing WWI adventures of a Bay Thoroughbred named Joey (during which he serves under Cumberbatch’s command), as well as the equally stirring tale of his young trainer (Jeremy Irvine). While some critics dismissed the results as glossy awards bait, it proved sufficiently moving for the majority; as Steven Rea wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer, “War Horse&nbsp;is sugary, to be sure — but it is sugar cut with cannon fire and barbed wire and the horrors of war.”Watch Trailer6. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)  83%Few novelists have ever been able to match the cerebral layers that John le Carré applied to his take on the spy thriller, and adapting his work for the screen has always been a daunting task, particularly given that he operated in a genre that’s tended to prize action over intelligence. But director Tomas Alfredson (working from an adaptation written by Bridget O’Connor and Peter Straughan) proved himself more than up to the task with this 2011 version of the author’s 1974 classic Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, starring Gary Oldman as a retired spy brought back into active duty to investigate some troubling claims made by a defected MI6 operative (Tom Hardy) with the aid of a trustworthy colleague (Cumberbatch). Cool-tempered and whip-smart, this Tailor&nbsp;brought the book satisfyingly to life for critics like NPR’s Ella Taylor, who wrote, “Alfredson offers no concessions to hindsight, no lessons for today. Instead, he’s kept faith with le Carré’s bleak, romantically elegiac vision of a moment in 20th century history at once glorious and doomed.”Watch Trailer5. Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)  84%It’d take an awful lot of rich Corinthian leather for any actor to try and one-up Ricardo Montalban’s definitive performance as Khan Noonien Singh in the original Star Trek&nbsp;franchise. To his credit, Cumberbatch offered a decidedly different take on the role in J.J. Abrams’ rebooted series timeline, bringing the character back to life in 2013’s Star Trek Into Darkness in his own inimitably villainous way. Although not a few reviews openly lamented the loss of the O.G. Trek‘s cerebral sci-fi at the expense of a heavier focus on action, most critics were hard-pressed to argue against Abrams’ good old-fashioned popcorn fun — or the talented cast. “What this movie does with a not-unfamiliar-to-some story is pretty clever,” admitted MSN Movies’ Glenn Kenny, “and the incarnation of a classic villain by British cheekbone virtuoso Benedict Cumberbatch is vivid and engaging.”Watch Trailer4. Starter for 10 (2006)  90%Cumberbatch’s first significant big-screen appearance came courtesy of Starter for 10, a dramedy about a college freshman (James McAvoy) who joins his campus quiz team and becomes embroiled in the squad’s interpersonal dynamics — including dealing with their snobby captain (Cumberbatch), who looks down on the new arrival despite not offering much in the way of value to the team. With a cast rounded out by Rebecca Hall, Dominic Cooper, and Alice Eve, Starter&nbsp;offered an early glimpse at a number of rising stars, as well as a fair bit of entertainment; as Claudia Puig wrote for USA Today, “The writing is nimble, the performances engaging and the story of a working-class boy who yearns to distinguish himself by acquiring knowledge is witty and intelligent.”Watch Trailer3. Doctor Strange (2016)  89%Ten years ago, the idea of a guy from London playing Marvel’s favorite Greenwich Village sorcerer seemed about as likely as the studio ever managing to make a big-screen Doctor Strange feature in the first place, but times have definitely changed. Cumberbatch donned the good Doctor’s Cloak of Levitation for what ended up becoming Marvel’s 14th consecutive No. 1 release, bringing his dramatic chops to bear on an effects-fueled adventure that repaid the audience’s patience for yet another origin story with mind-bending visuals and a storyline that brought the magical multiverse to the MCU. Hewing faithfully to the studio’s blockbuster formula while still finding refreshing ways to scribble outside the lines, the results earned overwhelmingly positive reviews — and were even intoxicating enough to win over critics who’d long since grown numb to the superhero genre’s appeal, like the New York Times’ Manohla Dargis, who described the spectacle as “so visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand.”Watch Trailer2. The Imitation Game (2014)  89%Alan Turing was a brilliant man whose work laid the foundation for theoretical computer science — and helped shorten World War II, saving countless lives in the process. He was also prosecuted for homosexual behavior at a time when the U.K. criminal code classified it as gross indecency, sentenced to chemical castration, and died of cyanide poisoning just shy of his 42nd birthday. A fascinating, influential, and painful life, in other words, all brought brilliantly to life in the Oscar-winning The Imitation Game, starring Cumberbatch as Turing in a role that brought him fresh accolades during a busy year that also included The Penguins of Madagascar and the final Hobbit&nbsp;film. “Cumberbatch is moviedom’s man of the moment,” observed Joe Williams for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “and with this painfully human performance, the actor who has specialized in difficult geniuses finally cracks the code of compassion.”Watch Trailer1. 12 Years a Slave (2013)  95%Before they shared the screen as Doctor Strange and Baron Mordo in Doctor Strange, Cumberbatch and Chiwetel Ejiofor met under very different circumstances in 12 Years a Slave — Ejiofor as kidnapped free man-turned-slave Solomon Northup, and Cumberbatch as William Ford, the first plantation owner to purchase him. Northup’s journey to Ford was decidedly unpleasant, but it was unfortunately a mere prelude to more than a decade of brutal misery suffered at the hands of others after Ford felt forced to sell him — immortalized on the screen in a grueling yet searingly compelling Best Picture winner. “12 Years a Slave&nbsp;isn’t easy to watch, and it shouldn’t be,” wrote Moira MacDonald for the Seattle Times. “It’s one man’s tragedy, but it’s also the tragedy of countless thousands of souls beaten down, literally and metaphorically.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"spy, BBC, 007, new, dogs, cults","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/07111739/Cumberbest.jpg","slug":"benedict-cumberbatchs-best-reviewed-movies"},{"id":"47508960909646","title":"Jeff Goldblum’s 10 Best-Reviewed Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jeff Goldblum's 10 Best-Reviewed MoviesWe run down the Independence Day: Resurgence star's most acclaimed films.by Jeff Giles | June 22, 2016 |  CommentsWith this weekend’s Independence Day: Resurgence, director Roland Emmerich returns his landmark-zapping aliens to Earth — and brings quirky computer expert David Levinson, a.k.a. Jeff Goldblum, back to the big screen. In honor of Mr. Goldblum’s cinematic resurgence, we decided to take a fond look back at some of the many highlights from his decades of film and television work, and pass the fun along to you. It’s time for Total Recall!The Big Chill (1983)  69%Every era gets the ensemble dramedy it deserves, and for the early ’80s, it was Lawrence Kasdan’s The Big Chill. Suffused with the same aching ’60s nostalgia that permeated its bestselling soundtrack, it united a corps of talented actors — including Goldblum, Glenn Close, William Hurt, and Kevin Kline — to dramatize the bittersweet reunion of a group of friends after one of their own dies (Kevin Costner in an infamously excised early role). Of course, like any quintessential movie worth its film stock, Chill&nbsp;is really about more than its characters; in telling this story, Kasdan was really reflecting, for better and for worse, the hopes, dreams, and suburban Cold War ennui of an entire generation. “Even though it’s aware of their narcissism, The Big Chill&nbsp;still views its characters sympathetically,” observed Keith Phipps for the Dissolve. “Even when they do little to invite much sympathy themselves.”Watch TrailerThe Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (1984)  68%There isn’t enough space here to fully explore the vast weirdness of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, but even if you’ve never heard of director W. D. Richter’s cult sci-fi rom-com classic, just reading the title is enough to tip you off. As attested by its miniscule box-office returns, the audiences of 1984 just weren’t ready to watch Peter Weller as a physicist/neurosurgeon/test pilot/rock star on a quest to save the world from an interstellar threat, but Buckaroo has earned a sizeable cult following over the years — and it remains the only film in which you can see Goldblum play a keyboardist/neurosurgeon who goes by “New Jersey” and helps beat back the alien hordes. “There’s so much going on here and so much fun to be had,” admitted Combustible Celluloid’s Jeffrey M. Anderson, “I’ve never really been sure what the plot was.”Watch TrailerIgby Goes Down (2002)  75%After the blockbuster roles stopped coming, Goldblum segued fairly smoothly into indie work, demonstrating the same willingness to take on unusual projects that led him to tape a voice role for an infamous Goosebumps CD-ROM in the mid-’90s. Among his most notable post-’90s arthouse efforts: 2002’s Igby Goes Down, in which he plays the godfather to a silver-spooned teen (Kieran Culkin) who ends up doing construction work in his employ for a summer after a series of rebellious antics get him kicked out of his mom’s house. The coming-of-age story has been told countless times, but writer-director Burr Steers gave Igby Goes Down a fresh enough spin — and a talented enough cast — to make it all seem new(ish) again. “In its own floundering way, it gets to you,” wrote Eleanor Ringel Gillespie for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Just like Igby.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Deep Cover (1992)  83%During the early years of his career, Goldblum was often called upon to play harmless dweebs, but as he demonstrated with his memorably bizarre performance in Death Wish, he makes a pretty mean bad guy — and he received a rare opportunity to prove it in 1992’s Deep Cover, a Bill Duke-directed crime thriller that pitted Laurence Fishburne’s undercover cop character against Goldblum as a sleazy, drug-dealing lawyer. It’s the kind of storyline setup that leads direct to video these days, but in the early ’90s, the genre still had a few fresh rounds to fire — and with Fishburne and Goldblum locking horns on the screen, and Dr. Dre (with a young Snoop Dogg in tow) making his solo debut on the soundtrack, this is a movie you want to reach for the next time you’re feeling tempted to watch a late-period Steven Seagal flick. As James Rocchi summed it up for Netflix, “Deep Cover&nbsp;was probably conceived as a quickie crime film, but thanks to Fishburne’s and Goldblum‘s performances, it became much more.”Watch TrailerThe Tall Guy (1990)  89%Ex-pat adventure, story within a story, expertly acted romantic comedy — 1990’s The Tall Guy&nbsp;is all of these things, with Jeff Goldblum in the title role as an American actor with a starring gig in a long-running London comedy revue. Overtaken with a case of allergies, he falls for a nurse, loses his job, and ends up landing a musical adaptation of The Elephant Man — and that isn’t really even the half of the oddball shenanigans in this production, which marked the feature debut of screenwriter Richard Curtis (not to mention director Mel Smith). It was all probably a little too left-field for mainstream audiences, but it proved a consistent favorite with critics. “This movie is right about a great many things,” wrote Roger Ebert. “One of them being that there is a market for comedy among people who were not born yesterday.”Watch TrailerLe Week-End (2014)  89%A little Jeff Goldblum can do a lot to improve even an already-entertaining movie: witness 2014’s Le Week-End, starring Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan as a couple who decide to spend their 30th anniversary revisiting the sights of their Parisian honeymoon. Needless to say, things don’t go quite as planned — but an inarguable highlight is the appearance of a fellow former student (Goldblum) whose invitation to a dinner party signals a major shift in the trip as well as their lives together. “This film doesn’t feel obliged to pick a winner or lob easy answers,” wrote the San Francisco Chronicle’s Walter Addiego. “It aims to observe, with humor and humanity, with penetration and without oversimplifying.”Watch TrailerThe Fly (1986)  92%The original version of The Fly, released in 1958, was a Vincent Price classic that didn’t really need to be remade, but that didn’t stop producer Stuart Cornfield (working with an uncredited Mel Brooks) from getting the ball rolling on a new version. After several years in development, plenty of studio struggle, and some turnover at the screenwriter and director positions, Cornfield had his movie: David Cronenberg’s gorier, more suspenseful take on The Fly, which went back to George Langelaan’s 1957 short story and emerged with one of the more delightfully suspenseful horror/sci-fi movies of the ‘80s. Cronenberg’s Fly — starring Goldblum as the ill-fated scientist whose experiments leave his DNA accidentally intertwined with the titular pest, and Geena Davis as the woman who loves him — updated the original with ickier special effects and anchored the story with soulful work from its well-matched stars, attracting a wave of critical acclaim and making more than $60 million in the bargain. “Only Cronenberg,” wrote Alan Jones for Radio Times, “can get away with working out his raw phobias on screen while being poignantly witty and repulsively entertaining at the same time.”Watch TrailerThe Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)  92%Goldblum‘s profile seemed to drop rather precipitously in the late ’90s, but he stayed busy — which is to say that, while his face may have come as a pleasant surprise when he walked onscreen as Deputy Vilmos Kovacs in The Grand Budapest Hotel, he’d actually acted steadily over the years. In fact, Hotel&nbsp;marked Goldblum‘s second time out with writer-director Wes Anderson: a decade earlier, he’d appeared as Allistair Hennessey in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Here, he served as one quickly spinning cog in a madcap confection about a hotel concierge (Ralph Fiennes) desperately trying to prove his innocence after being framed for murder, and the result was an Oscar-nominated, critically lauded hit. “Grand isn’t good enough a word for this Budapest Hotel,” wrote Time’s Richard Corliss. “Great is more like it.”Watch TrailerJurassic Park (1993)  91%After a decade and change of playing quirky characters, Goldblum finally got his shot at action hero status with Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park&nbsp;— only to be overshadowed by a slew of thrillingly realistic CGI dinosaurs. Adapted from Michael Crichton’s bestselling novel, Park&nbsp;offered sublime spectacle without forgetting the cardinal rule of filmmaking: You have to tell a story audiences are going to care about. To that end, Park&nbsp;assembled a cast of savvy character actors (including Goldblum, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Richard Attenborough) to lend heart and believability to a sci-fi-infused tale about a goofy millionaire (Attenborough) who bankrolls a vacation destination filled with real live dinosaurs. It would be disingenuous to suggest that David Koepp and Michael Crichton’s script spent much time on human characterizations; it was far too busy zipping around from one dino-peril to the next. But that was just fine with audiences, who made Jurassic Park&nbsp;the year’s top-grossing film by a wide margin — and with most critics, including Movieline’s Stephen Farber, who admitted, “True, the dialogue and performances are feeble, but the thing is basically no more — and no less — than a nifty monster movie that delivers crackerjack thrills.”Watch TrailerInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)  92%The original Invasion of the Body Snatchers&nbsp;was an acknowledged classic by 1978, when director Philip Kaufman took the reins of a fairly gutsy remake that, by all rights, should have been overshadowed by its predecessor. There’s an exception to every rule, however, and Kaufman’s Snatchers&nbsp;surprised filmgoers by not only boasting improved special effects, but a terrific W.D. Richter script that whose taut, ensemble-driven story was well served by an impressive cast that included Donald Sutherland, Veronica Cartwright, Leonard Nimoy, and Jeff Goldblum (not to mention Jerry Garcia as “Banjo Player”). Calling it a “dazzling remake of one of the cleverest of horror classics,” Janet Maslin of the New York Times applauded, “There’s a little something extra in virtually every frame.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"TV, latino, Spike, independent","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/22150350/Jeff-Goldblum-Recall.jpg","slug":"jeff-goldblums-10-best-reviewed-movies"},{"id":"47508962616656","title":"Best-Reviewed Movies Produced by Judd Apatow","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Best-Reviewed Movies Produced by Judd ApatowIn this week's Total Recall, we look at the most critically acclaimed films that the comedy heavyweight has produced.by Jeff Giles | June 1, 2016 |  CommentsJudd Apatow isn’t just a producer, of course; he’s also a director and writer, and many of his movies find him occupying all three chairs. Still, it’s his list of production credits that runs longest – and may contain a few surprises for those who haven’t been following his career closely – so we thought this weekend’s Apatow-produced Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping&nbsp;would be the perfect time to give them the Total Recall treatment. We did get a little technical, and cut out the films where he served as an executive producer (bye bye, Heavyweights, Celtic Pride, Kicking and Screaming, and The TV Set) as well as associate producer (thus excising 1992’s Crossing the Bridge), and popular favorites like Anchorman, Pineapple Express, and Step Brothers didn’t make the cut. Don’t worry, though – that still leaves us plenty to discuss. Ready to get started? It’s Total Recall time!Get Him to the Greek (2010)  72%Before he launched a second career as an agitator for social justice and economic equality, Russell Brand was a pretty funny guy — and although his particular shtick definitely wasn’t right for every role, it could be quite effective in the proper context. For example, there’s Brand’s scene-stealing supporting turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall,&nbsp;in which he played the cheerfully hedonistic rock star that the title character hooks up with after dumping poor Jason Segel — a role he reprised a couple years later for Get Him to the Greek. Here, Brand’s Aldous Snow must be shepherded to a crucial gig through a landmine of bad decisions and irresponsible behavior, with responsibility for his whereabouts falling to an increasingly overmatched label rep (Jonah Hill). “The movie’s a good, rude commercial comedy,” argued the Chicago Tribune’s Michael Phillips. “How many good movies have we even seen this year?”Watch TrailerWalk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007)  74%Judd Apatow productions are known for their skillful use of humor that feels real — sometimes squirm-inducingly — so the news that he was co-writing and producing a mock biopic of a legendary musician named Dewey Cox (and that Cox would be played by the mercilessly funny John C. Reilly) was greeted with enthusiasm by critics and fans hungry for more 40-Year-Old Virgin-style laughs. Ultimately, expectations for Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&nbsp;proved slightly unreasonable; although critics applauded the film, moviegoers chose not to follow Apatow down this particular path, and it failed to recoup its budget. Still, despite being one of Apatow’s rare commercial misfires, Walk Hard&nbsp;is one of the better-reviewed entries on his resume, and boasts the approval of no less a critical luminary than Roger Ebert, who applauded its restraint when he wrote, “instead of sending everything over the top at high energy, like Top Secret&nbsp;or Airplane!, they allow Reilly to more or less actually play the character, so that, against all expectations, some scenes actually approach real sentiment.”Watch TrailerPee-wee's Big Holiday (2016)  80%Pee-Wee Herman entered the 1990s as a fairly tired joke (and an unwillingly dirty one at that), but given enough time and nostalgia, almost everything old is new again. Herman’s creator, Paul Reubens, discovered as much after exhuming the character for a series of public appearances that led into a revival of his stage show — and a lengthy development process for a third Pee-Wee&nbsp;movie. Reubens ultimately hooked up with Apatow to produce Pee-Wee’s Big Holiday, a 2016 release that bowed on Netflix alongside its theatrical run. While the movie’s rollout might have been cutting edge, the story — and Pee-Wee himself — remained substantially the same as his heyday, adding up to a film offering a high-grade flashback to a franchise many critics remembered so fondly they were willing to let its narrative deficiencies slide. As the San Francisco Chronicle’s David Wiegand put it, “After all these years — his and ours — Pee-wee Herman is still a Peter Pan who can lead us back to innocence with a corny joke or a childish jape.”Watch TrailerBegin Again (2014)  83%Judd Apatow isn’t the first person you’d think of to produce a movie from the guy who gave us the tenderly mournful indie drama Once, but that’s just what we got with 2014’s Begin Again&nbsp;— and it was pretty darn good, too. Admittedly, the movie offered something of a slicker spin on Once‘s story of two damaged souls connecting through music, but while there were similarities between the two films, they weren’t overwhelming. And as he had with his previous outing, Carney showed a tremendous flair for following the tentative, skipping beat of a developing relationship — not to mention a knack for assembling a fine cast (led here by Mark Ruffalo, Keira Knightley, and Adam Levine) and a soundtrack worthy of repeat listens. “Carney deserves great credit for the movie’s clever, layered structure, and for resisting a few obvious plot turns along the way,” wrote Moira MacDonald for the Seattle Times. “Lightning doesn’t strike, but sunshine works, too.”Watch TrailerForgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)  83%As the title of his latest feature suggests, Judd Apatow knows funny people — and he has a knack for working with his comedic leads at exactly the right time. After helping Steve Carell and Seth Rogen cross over to superstardom, Apatow added his magic producer’s touch to Jason Segel’s breakout feature, 2008’s Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which deftly combined the elements we’ve come to expect from Apatow-branded comedies (painfully real humor, uncomfortable nudity) with utterly unique ingredients (singing vampire puppets). The results proved, once again, that if they’re assembled properly, movies that skirt the rim of lowbrow humor can squeeze a couple of hours’ worth of laughs out of even the most highfalutin critics. In his review, the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern echoed Sarah Marshall‘s many accolades when he wrote, “Halfway through I realized that I’d lost most of my standards, maybe under my seat, and was enjoying the erratic evolution of the nonsense.”Watch TrailerThe 40 Year Old Virgin (2005)  85%Judd Apatow seemed to come out of nowhere with 2005’s The 40-Year-Old Virgin, his directorial debut — but the reality, of course, is that his ascension was far more gradual; he landed his first associate producers’ credit with 1992’s Crossing the Bridge, and his name surfaced throughout the 1990s and early aughts in connection with projects both well-received (The Larry Sanders Show, Freaks and Geeks, Undeclared) and, well, not (Celtic Pride, The Cable Guy). But Apatow’s signature brand of comedy didn’t really reach full bloom until Virgin — and its awkward pauses, creative profanity (“Kelly Clarkson!”), and off-the-wall pop culture gags (Asia! Michael McDonald!) arrived at the perfect moment for a moviegoing public starved for smart adult humor. The result left Steve Carell with a new level of fame, made Judd Apatow a household name, and helped resurrect the R-rated comedy. It didn’t do too badly with critics, either; Bill Muller of the Arizona Republic was solidly in line with the sentiments of his peers when he wrote that Virgin&nbsp;was “a nostalgic, sentimental and wholly bawdy comedy that will make you laugh until your sides hurt.”Watch TrailerTrainwreck (2015)  84%Apatow has proven himself a reliable incubator for young comics over the years, and although he can’t take credit for the rise of Amy Schumer, there’s no denying the sharp eye for talent he again displayed when he hitched his wagon to her star for the 2015 hit Trainwreck. Directing from a script written by Schumer, Apatow once again helped assemble a picture offering a distaff twist on the boundary-pushing comedy he’d turned into big business a decade before — and although the story was basically just a gender reversal on the same old story about a lovable lout who finds happiness by growing up and embracing commitment, the end result was charming and well-written enough for the vast majority of critics to forgive the familiarity. In fact, argued the New York Post’s Sara Stewart, “Trainwreck&nbsp;is a corrective to a lot of outdated clichés. It’s very funny and sweet and even a little weepy, and it has maybe the best scene ever filmed of dirty talk gone wrong.”Watch TrailerSuperbad (2007)  88%Having been a staunch supporter of Seth Rogen’s from their days together on the set of Freaks and Geeks, Apatow was already well acquainted with Rogen’s comedic talents even before they teamed up to make a ton of box office cash with Knocked Up&nbsp;— which doubtless had a lot to do with why Apatow was interested in producing Superbad, a high school loss-of-virginity flick in the grand tradition of Fast Times at Ridgemont High&nbsp;and American Pie. Superbad‘s premise, which teamed Jonah Hill and Michael Cera with newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse on a quest to secure booze for a house party, may have been embarrassingly familiar, but Rogen and his writing partner, Evan Goldberg, nonetheless managed to squeeze fresh laughs (and plenty of ticket receipts) from it — not to mention kudos from critics like the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick LaSalle, who wrote, “for pure laughs, for the experience of just sitting in a chair and breaking up every minute or so, Superbad is 2007’s most successful comedy.”Watch TrailerKnocked Up (2007)  89%Schlubby dudes that inexplicably manage to score with babes have been a comedy staple for decades, on screens both small (Newhart, According to Jim) and silver (everything Woody Allen has ever done). Into that rich tradition stepped 2007’s Knocked Up, Apatow’s wildly successful directorial follow-up to The 40-Year-Old Virgin, which paired rumpled slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) with gorgeous E! Network employee Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) for a look at what can happen when you head to a club, have a few too many drinks, and don’t give a lot of thought to who comes home with you. (This is Hollywood, of course, so what ends up happening is everlasting love, but not before a lot of funnier, more unpleasant consequences.) An enormous box office success, Knocked Up&nbsp;kickstarted Rogen’s career, cemented Apatow’s standing as a purveyor of fine adult comedies, and earned the adoration of critics such as Stephanie Zacharek of Salon, who called it “Hilarious from moment to moment, but leaving behind both a warm glow and a sting. This is a picture that refuses to fetishize either the ability to conceive or the significance of our place in the universe once we’ve done so.”Watch TrailerBridesmaids (2011)  90%Apatow made a name for himself with crass humor largely brought to life by man-child protagonists, but the bros took a back seat for 2011’s Bridesmaids, in which director Paul Feig corralled a crew of hilarious ladies — including Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, and Kristen Wiig (who co-wrote the script with Annie Mumolo) — to depict their bawdy misadventures during the days leading up to a wedding. After helping make the box office safe for R-rated comedy, Apatow helped prove audiences were just as willing to turn out for grown-up laughs of the female-driven variety — and nearly $300 million in receipts later, the end result looked like the beginning of a paradigm shift in Hollywood. “It’s not a movie for people looking for a decorous night at the movies,” admitted the Newark Star-Ledger’s Stephen Whitty. “It is a film, though, for folks eager for some good dirty jokes, some refreshingly real female characters – and, just maybe, a new comic voice.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"awards, lord, Fox, movies, Studios, TLC, Central","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/01131103/Judd-Apatow-Productions.jpg","slug":"best-reviewed-movies-produced-by-judd-apatow"},{"id":"47508960901451","title":"Bryan Cranston’s Best Roles","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Bryan Cranston's Best RolesWe look back at the best-known work of the star of The Infiltrator.by Jeff Giles | July 13, 2016 |  CommentsBryan Cranston brings a true story to the screen with this weekend’s The Infiltrator, and in appreciation for his efforts, we decided to dig into his extensive filmography and select some of our favorite roles. Sure, you’ll find a nod to Walter White in here, but Mr. Cranston’s career is a heck of a lot more than Breaking Bad; from comedy to award-winning drama, there’s truly something for everyone in here. Make room in your queues, ’cause it’s time for Total Recall!Titanium Rex (SuperMansion)As Cranston’s profile has grown in recent years, he’s plowed some of that newfound clout back into his own production efforts — such as Sneaky Pete, recently ordered to series at Amazon, and the animated SuperMansion, which will debut its second season on Crackle in 2017. Working alongside a roster of voice talent that includes Keegan-Michael Key and Seth Green, Cranston stars as Titanium Rex, the aging leader of a past-its-prime group of heroes; although the results have thus far been neither universally acclaimed nor particularly widely seen, it’s worth checking out for Cranston fans and stop-motion enthusiasts with an off-kilter sense of humor. After all, how many cartoons give a guy the chance to play a character with a titanium hand and a prostate problem?Lance (Last Chance)In a 2009 interview, Cranston pointed to this little-seen 1999 drama — which he produced, directed, wrote, and starred in — as the one project from his filmography that he didn’t think had gotten the attention it deserved. “I think Last Chance&nbsp;was an interesting tale,” he mused. “It’s the story of someone who doesn’t believe that they have any hope left in their life, and when an opportunity presents itself, will you even recognize it? Do you take advantage of it? Do you ignore it? So it was all about that, and about hope, and taking your last chance if it’s offered.”Tim Whatley (Seinfeld)Seinfeld‘s comedy largely derived from the sturdy dynamics between the show’s central foursome, which meant there wasn’t much need for a lot of recurring characters — and as a result, the ones who did manage to return more than a time or two were generally pretty memorable. Case in point: Jerry’s dentist Tim Whatley, played by Cranston over a handful of episodes throughout the show’s run — some of which were among its most memorable. Aside from giving him a chance to show off his comedic chops, Cranston’s Seinfeld&nbsp;spots put him down in sitcom history as one of the people who helped bring the world “re-gifter” and “anti-dentite.”Shannon (Drive)After a few seasons of Breaking Bad, Cranston’s Hollywood stock had risen to the point where he was being actively sought out for movie roles — for example, Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive. Cranston was Refn’s first choice for Shannon, the body shop owner whose lucrative side business involves hiring out his star employee (Ryan Gosling) as a no-questions-asked getaway driver, and even though Cranston’s plate was already pretty full — and the part was far from the movie’s showiest — he was sufficiently intrigued to sign on. The result? Screen time in one of the year’s most critically adored movies. “This,” wrote Deadspin’s Will Leitch, “is pop art of the highest degree.”Jack O’Donnell (Argo)Like a lot of characters in Argo, Cranston’s character was an amalgam of actual individuals involved in the movie’s real-life story — and like many of the incredible actors assembled for the Oscar-winning drama, he didn’t have an overwhelming amount of screentime. But as Jack O’Donnell, the boss of CIA exfiltrator Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) during the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, Cranston plays a crucial role — both for Mendez, who relies on O’Donnell as his lifeline back to the States during his mission in Iran, and for the audience, who feel the tension and urgency of the situation back home through his increasingly strained efforts to pull the whole thing off. “Is it me,” wondered the San Diego Reader’s Scott Marks, “or should Bryan Cranston be in every film released?”Joe Brody (Godzilla)Okay, so Bryan Cranston isn’t in Godzilla&nbsp;for anywhere near the length of time he deserved — but that doesn’t take anything away from the fact that his character is the emotional centerpiece of the first act. As Joe Brody, the nuclear plant supervisor who’s among the first to suspect that the human race might be staring down the barrel of an enormous catastrophe, Cranston carried the burden of setting up a hugely over-the-top story in an easily relatable way, and he pulled it off with aplomb. The movie would have been a lot better if Joe stuck around a little longer, but the results are still pretty entertaining, and they offered Cranston a too-rare opportunity to display dramatic range in a blockbuster action thriller. “This is exactly what big summer movies ought to aspire to,” wrote NPR’s Ian Buckwalter. “Never short on dazzle, but unafraid to let us catch our breath once it’s been taken away.”Dalton Trumbo (Trumbo)Cranston’s piled up a lot of screen credits over the years, but relatively few have been leading roles. One notable exception is 2015’s Trumbo, in which he portrays the legendary screenwriter during and after his politically motivated fall from professional grace. Delivering a full-bodied performance that neither lionized nor demonized Trumbo, Cranston proved he was more than capable of carrying a movie — even one that, as critics reluctantly pointed out, wasn’t necessarily up to its subject’s impeccable standards. “Cranston’s performance is the motor that runs Trumbo,” wrote Ty Burr for the Boston Globe. “And that motor never idles, never flags in momentum or magnetism or idealistic scorn.”Lyndon B. Johnson (All the Way)It takes a special kind of actor to disappear so far inside a character that the audience forgets it’s watching someone go to work, and that goes at least double when the character in question was a real-life individual. All of which is to say that Cranston deserves every bit of the voluminous praise he picked up for his work in All the Way, which dramatizes Lyndon B. Johnson’s actions during the period leading up to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. After winning a Tony for his portrayal of Johnson on the stage, Cranston reprised the role for HBO’s film adaptation, and earned another round of critical applause. “All the Way&nbsp;should be admired for going the distance,” wrote Ben Travers for IndieWIRE, “and Cranston rewarded for holding it all together.”Hal Wilkerson (Malcolm in the Middle)Long before he stripped down to his briefs for Breaking Bad, Cranston made a habit of it on Malcolm in the Middle, the long-running Fox sitcom about a quirky suburban family rounded out by a brood of boys and led by a no-nonsense mom. As the father, Cranston was often just as much of a kid as his onscreen sons — and twice as afraid of their mother (Jane Kaczmarek) — adding yet another sweetly clueless sitcom dad to an already lengthy list. Yet while Malcolm&nbsp;didn’t exactly reinvent the TV comedy wheel, it did what it set out to do consistently well, and earned Cranston a passel of Emmy nominations along the way.Walter White (Breaking Bad)Cranston’s done a lot of fine work throughout his career, but he’ll probably always be most closely identified with Breaking Bad. It makes sense, really — how often does an actor get the chance to star in a hit series about a high school chemistry teacher who turns to manufacturing and selling his own meth in order to shore up funds for his family after learning he’s dying of cancer? Critically acclaimed and consistently successful in the ratings, Breaking Bad&nbsp;was also an awards magnet — not least for Cranston, whose depiction of Walter White’s descent into the criminal underworld netted him four Lead Actor Emmys during the show’s run. “One way or another, you’ve got to figure Walt is going down,” wrote the Cleveland Plain Dealer’s Mark Dawidziak during the final season. “And, thanks to Cranston, he’s going down in TV history as one of the medium’s most fascinating, memorable and grandly tragic characters.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Awards, serial, CBS, hispanic, Hallmark, streaming, worst","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13170651/Bryan-Cranston-Recall.jpg","slug":"bryan-cranstons-best-roles"},{"id":"47508962640214","title":"Definitive Naomi Watts Performances","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Naomi Watts PerformancesIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at the roles that helped define the Demolition's star's career.by Jeff Giles | April 6, 2016 |  CommentsNaomi Watts‘ appearance in this weekend’s Demolition expands an eclectic filmography that’s seen her going from indie dramas to big-budget blockbusters and back again. In honor of this latest venture to the big screen, we decided to take a look back at some of her best-reviewed films and gather up a list of definitive Naomi Watts performances. It’s time for Total Recall!Mother and Child (2010)  78%Writer-director Rodrigo Garcia Barcha followed his Sixth Sense-ish thriller Passengers with this quiet character study, which traces the impact of adoption through the stories of three women (played by Watts, Annette Bening, and Kerry Washington) and their families. Add in an ensemble supporting cast that included Jimmy Smits, Amy Brenneman, and Samuel L. Jackson and you’ve got a tremendously talented group of stars whose subtle work helped critics look past Mother and Child’s occasionally bumpy script. “The film reminds us that character, not plot, is what binds us to a story,” observed Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune. “Cutting between scenes of each in her unique environment, the movie tantalizes us.”Watch TrailerFair Game (2010)  79%Frequent co-stars Naomi Watts and Sean Penn reunited for their third production with 2010’s Fair Game, a dramatization of the so-called “Plamegate” affair — a 2003 incident that saw CIA agent Valerie Plame resigning from the agency after her identity was outed by a journalist writing for the Washington Post. Feeling Plame’s exposure was politically motivated retribution for comments made by her husband Joseph C. Wilson, an ambassador who’d been openly critical of the current administration, the two cooperated with a special investigator’s grand jury investigation — and then pursued civil action against those they held responsible. A tough story to tell without seeming like you have an axe to grind, but according to most critics, director Doug Liman and his stars did a bang-up job. “The blind-siding of Valerie Plame wasn’t fair and wasn’t a game,” wrote Joe Williams for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “but this cinematic outcome is a touchdown for true patriots.”Watch Trailer21 Grams (2003)  80%One of several collaborations between Watts and Alejandro González Iñárritu, 21 Grams certainly isn’t the happiest film on this list, but it wrings some outstanding performances (not to mention plenty of tears) out of an outstanding cast. Using a handful of seemingly disparate plot threads, Iñárritu plunged viewers into the darkness pooling out of a tragedy unintentionally wrought by an ex-con (Benicio del Toro) whose irrevocable mistake has a profound impact on a dying math professor (Sean Penn) and a woman with a complicated past (Naomi Watts) — all of which are drawn irrevocably together by the final act. Watts and del Toro both earned Oscar nominations for their work, and neither could be accused of holding anything back; as Moira MacDonald wrote for the Seattle Times, “Watching it is a wrenching experience; the usual layers of distance between actors and audience are stripped away, and we not only watch their anguish, but become part of it.”Watch TrailerThe Impossible (2012)  81%Set out to make a movie about one of the more horrific tragedies in recent memory, and you’ve got your work cut out for you — like any good dramatist, you have to make real-life events cinema-worthy without dishonoring the people who actually experienced them, but with the added pressure of large-scale death and destruction hanging over your film. By most accounts, Juan Antonio Bayona’s The Impossible did a noble enough job of representing the Indian Ocean tsunami that wreaked havoc on Boxing Day of 2004, and while some critics resented the way it focused on one white family of tourists (led by Watts and Ewan McGregor) at the expense of the people who actually lived in the region, and others dismissed the whole thing as manipulative Oscar bait, most writers found it (ahem) impossible not to be moved. Calling it “An intense and compelling family melodrama,” Salon’s Andrew O’Hehir argued that it “sets a new standard for disaster cinema.”Watch TrailerMulholland Drive (2001)  83%It resists synopsis and analysis in characteristically Lynchian fashion, but whatever it may or may not actually be about, Mulholland Drive opens a dark window into the twilight fringes of Hollywood inhabited by an aspiring actress (Naomi Watts) who arrives in Los Angeles and discovers an amnesiac woman (Laura Harring) living in her aunt’s apartment. As for the film itself, well, critics have been puzzling over its surreal imagery, nonlinear plot, and jumbled narrative since Mulholland arrived in theaters — but whether or not you can figure out what it all means, argued the New York Observer’s Andrew Sarris, it’s “One of the very few movies in which the pieces not only add up to much more than the whole, but also supersede it with a series of (for the most part) fascinating fragments.”Watch TrailerKing Kong (2005)  84%It takes a lot of guts to step into a role that’s already been made famous by another actor, so even if her work in Peter Jackson’s King Kong had been downright awful, Watts would have deserved major points simply for agreeing to try and assume the part of the simian-bewitching Ann Darrow from the legendary Fay Wray. Happily for all concerned, the 21st century Kong — while perhaps unnecessary — managed to graft modern effects onto a timeless tale without putting too big of a dent in the iconic original’s charm. “Monstrous. Monumental. Magnificent,” wrote Tom Long for the Detroit News. “Use any term you want, there’s no denying the power, genius and spectacle of King Kong, which is certainly the biggest movie of the year and possibly the biggest movie ever made.”Watch TrailerWhile We're Young (2015)  84%It would be hard to argue that there’s a shortage of indie dramedies about ennui-riddled upper middle-class New York Caucasians, but that doesn’t mean their stories can’t be effectively told by the right director with the right script. Case in point: While We’re Young, in which Watts and Ben Stiller co-star as spouses whose repressed misgivings about their lives are stirred up when they make the acquaintance of a younger couple (Adam Driver and Amanda Seyfried) who seem to have the spark they fear they’ve lost along the way. “If you’ve been wishing you could see a good Woody Allen comedy again, you should check out Noah Baumbach’s While We’re Young,” wrote the Globe and Mail’s Liam Lacey, saying it “sees the 45-year-old director moving in on Allen’s territory — the Manhattan comedy of manners.”Watch TrailerEastern Promises (2007)  89%Two years after mixing equal parts “bloody” and “thought-provoking” to create A History of Violence, David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen reunited for Eastern Promises, an equally hard-hitting drama about a driver for the Russian mafia. Promises‘ plot is set in motion after a midwife (Watts) delivers a baby whose teenage mother dies in childbirth; after a clue in the girl’s belongings leads to a Russian mob boss, things quickly start to get pretty gnarly for all concerned, including an infamous fight scene taking place in a steam room. “If you don’t mind bloodshed and are drawn to taut thrillers with fascinating characters portrayed skillfully,” wrote Claudia Puig for USA Today, “Eastern Promises is just the ticket.”Watch TrailerBirdman (2014)  91%Michael Keaton received most of the attention for Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s Birdman, and deservedly so — aside from the impressive level of visual craft that went into preserving the illusion that the movie took place in a single shot, its primary asset is its star, particularly for viewers who missed Keaton during his long absence from leading roles. That said, Iñárritu assembled a stellar cast all the way around for the project, including Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Amy Ryan, and Naomi Watts. Whether you’re a Birdman fan or you agree with the backlash, this look at the emotional travails of a washed-up actor trying to prove his dramatic mettle with a stage play is eminently well acted by a top-to-bottom talented ensemble. “Birdman, more than most, seems a film that deserves a second viewing,” wrote Jocelyn Novecek for the Associated Press. “Not only to admire the work of Keaton and his co-stars, but to delve into its many layers.”Watch TrailerFlirting (1992)  96%Writer-director John Duigan may have felt like he landed a casting coup when he signed Nicole Kidman for Flirting, but the rising Australian star — then enjoying a growing international profile thanks to her work in Dead Calm and Days of Thunder — was only part of a stellar ensemble cast packed with future household names, including Watts and Thandie Newton. Although its storyline follows the same rough contours as many other coming-of-age dramas, those performances — and the skill with which Duigan told his characters’ stories — left many critics reeling. “Flirting is one of those rare movies with characters I cared about intensely,” enthused Roger Ebert. “I didn’t simply observe them on the screen, I got involved in their decisions and hoped they made the right ones.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"crime, BAFTA, of, Super, Peacock","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/06172453/NaomiWattsRecall2.jpg","slug":"definitive-naomi-watts-performances"},{"id":"47508971557299","title":"Johnny Depp’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Johnny Depp's Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Transcendence star.by Jeff Giles | April 17, 2014 |  Comments He once seemed destined for nothing better or worse than simple teen idolhood, but since escaping from 21 Jump Street in 1990, Johnny Depp has proven himself to be a brave (and mostly pretty astute) chooser of scripts, building an impressive filmography that encompasses everything from black-and-white arthouse fare (Dead Man) to blockbuster Disney trilogies (Pirates of the Caribbean). This weekend, he returns to theaters in Transcendence as a scientist who has his consciousness uploaded to the cloud, so we thought now would be a fine time to devote a fresh installment of Total Recall to counting down the 10 best-reviewed releases of Depp’s 30-year (and counting) film career. 84%10. Tim Burton’s Corpse BrideTwelve years after producing Henry Selick for The Nightmare Before Christmas, Tim Burton returned to stop-motion animation with Corpse Bride, a collaboration with co-director Mike Johnson. Starring Depp as the voice of Victor Van Dort, a skittish young fishmongers’ son who finds himself accidentally wed to an undead hottie (Helena Bonham Carter), Bride used a Jewish folktale for it’s story’s inspiration, but visually, it offered a sort of hybrid between Nightmare and Beetlejuice, with all the stylish flair and sweet melancholy that filmgoers had come to expect from a Tim Burton production. Though Bride didn’t exert the level of box office dominance enjoyed by 2005’s other Burton/Depp project, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it still grossed over $100 million worldwide — and earned the admiration of critics like the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Steven Rea, who gushed, “Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride is easily the best stop-motion animated necrophiliac musical romantic comedy of all time. It is also just simply, wonderful: a morbid, merry tale of true love that dazzles the eyes and delights the soul.” 83%9. Finding NeverlandSticklers for accuracy bristled at the liberties it took with J.M. Barrie’s life story, but Finding Neverland was still good enough for audiences — who made it a $100 million-plus hit — and the Academy, which bestowed Johnny Depp with a Best Actor nomination for his work as the playwright and Peter Pan author. Neverland finds Barrie nursing his wounds after the failure of his most recent play, befriending a widow (Kate Winslet) and her young boys, and taking inspiration from their unorthodox friendship — even as it costs him his own marriage and puts him at odds with the boys’ grandmother (Julie Christie). “Plenty of narrative liberties have been taken,” admitted Jason Blake of the Sydney Morning Herald, who then argued that “It doesn’t matter a jot. At heart, this isn’t a biography anyway, it’s an ode to the power of the imagination.” 87%8. Arizona DreamFilmed in 1991, Emir Kusturica’s Arizona Dream languished in limbo for two years before it was released in Europe — and it didn’t reach American shores until the following September, at which point it grossed a little over $100,000 in limited release. It seems like a pretty harsh fate for a movie featuring Johnny Depp, Jerry Lewis, and Faye Dunaway, but if you’ve ever seen Dream, you know it is not, to put it mildly, the type of film Hollywood studios were made to promote. The story of a fish tagger (Depp) who believes he can see the fishes’ dreams, it’s over two hours of absurdist comedy, packed with symbolism-laden dream sequences and oddball characters like Grace, the turtle-obsessed young woman played by Lili Taylor. Even the critics that enjoyed it used words like “peculiar,” “odd,” and “bizarre” to describe Dream; as Janet Maslin of the New York Times wrote, “Even at its full length, showing off a more seductive rhythm and the buoyant humanism that is this director’s calling card, it remains as ripe a subject for therapy as for criticism.” 86%7. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet StreetMore than 15 years after lip-synching to the voice of James Intveld in Cry-Baby, Johnny Depp returned to the world of cinematic musicals — and marked his sixth collaboration with Tim Burton — for 2007’s Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, an appropriately bloody adaptation of the Sondheim play about a Victorian barber whose unjust imprisonment sparks a murderous (and ultimately tragic) quest for revenge. This time around, however, Depp did his own singing — and acquitted himself rather admirably, surprising critics who expected a Return of Bruno-sized embarrassment from another actor trying to get by with a few vocal lessons and a ton of chutzpah. On the acting front, the critical hosannas afforded Sweeney Todd‘s cast — which included a gleefully deranged Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman as another of the deliciously grotesque villains he plays so well — were less unexpected; at this point, critics had come to expect a certain level of quality from Depp and Burton’s collaborations, and for the most part, they came away satisfied. As Roger Ebert summed it up in his review, “it combines some of Tim Burton’s favorite elements: The fantastic, the ghoulish, the bizarre, the unspeakable, the romantic and in Johnny Depp, he has an actor he has worked with since Edward Scissorhands and finds a perfect instrument.” 88%6. Donnie BrascoThe mid-to-late 1990s were an uneven period for Depp; although he scored a medium-sized hit at the box office with 1995’s Don Juan De Marco, it isn’t one of his best-reviewed performances (and it allowed Bryan Adams back into the Top 40, too). Other releases during this period ranged from the willfully non-commercial (1995’s Dead Man) to the just plain unpopular (Nick of Time, released the same year). 1997’s Donnie Brasco, a dramatization of the FBI’s late ’70s investigation into the Bonanno crime syndicate, wasn’t an enormous hit, but it earned respectable grosses — and more importantly, it allowed Depp to work with a director (Mike Newell) and legendary co-star (Al Pacino) who brought out the best in him. Depp plays Joe Pistone, the FBI agent assigned to infiltrate the Bonanno gang by pretending to be a diamond expert named Donnie Brasco and ingratiating himself to a low-level foot soldier named Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino); since Pistone’s situation (as well as Paul Attanasio’s script) keeps much of his true self hidden beneath the surface, the part required an actor capable of communicating very subtly, and Depp rose to the occasion. His between-the-lines performance was matched by Pacino, who dialed back the high-volume bluster he’d become known for, earning the pair praise from critics like the Houston Chronicle’s Jeff Millar, who wrote, “Depp is as good as I’ve seen him, and Pacino is simply astonishing.” 88%5. RangoWhen director Gore Verbinski ventured into uncharted territory for his animated debut, he brought along familiar company: Johnny Depp, who starred in the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies with Verbinski at the helm (and continued the franchise without him the same year, toplining the decidedly less Tomatometer-friendly On Stranger Tides for new director Rob Marshall). The duo combined Verbinski’s box office instincts with Depp’s love of the strange for Rango, a delightfully off-kilter cartoon about a pet chameleon who ends up stranded in the desert and bumbles his way into being appointed sheriff of a town under siege by a vicious rattlesnake (voiced by Bill Nighy). Although a handful of critics were put off by Rango‘s surreal overtones and adult humor, audiences approved to the tune of a $245 million worldwide gross, the Academy awarded it Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, and the vast majority of writers echoed the sentiments of the New Yorker’s Bruce Diones, who said it was “built for viewers of any age with a taste for joyful anarchy.” 90%4. What’s Eating Gilbert GrapeNot counting the delayed Arizona Dream, Johnny Depp released two movies in 1993, both of them handling themes of mental illness with a relatively gentle touch. Of the pair, Benny &amp; Joon arrived in theaters first, but it was What’s Eating Gilbert Grape that ultimately held a firmer grip on critics’ hearts, earning an 89 percent Tomatometer rating and an Academy Award nomination for Leonardo DiCaprio, who laid the groundwork for his post-Growing Pains future with a breakout performance as the mentally handicapped younger brother of the small-town grocery clerk whose inner conflicts are reflected in the title. Torn between familial obligations and a need to establish a life of his own, Gilbert gave Depp another opportunity to perfect the “sensitive misfit” archetype he’d been drawn back to repeatedly since making Edward Scissorhands. It was a type of role he’d soon branch out from, but in the meantime, Gilbert Grape entranced critics like Susan Tavernetti, who wrote, “with an eccentric charm that falters only in a few places, the movie makes a strong statement against conformity and the franchising of America by celebrating a cast of characters and a storyline that don’t fit into a mold.” 90%3. Edward Scissorhands21 Jump Street made Johnny Depp a household name, but heck, the show did the same thing for Richard Grieco; to become a star, Depp needed to carry a film that really got people talking — and he found that film in Edward Scissorhands, the December 1990 release that was the first of what would become many collaborations with director Tim Burton. He’d been in a handful of movies already, but Scissorhands was the one that really launched Depp’s career; in fact, he embodied the role of the titular blade-fisted misfit so thoroughly that it’s difficult to imagine how it could have been pulled off by any of the actors previously floated for it — a list including famous names such as Robert Downey, Jr., William Hurt, Tom Cruise, and Michael Jackson. A critical as well as commercial hit, Edward Scissorhands set the tone for much of what was to come from both Burton and Depp, and won high marks from writers like the Washington Post’s Desson Thomson, who noted, “Depp is perfectly cast, Burton builds a surrealistically funny cul-de-sac world, and there are some very funny performances from grownups Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker and Alan Arkin.” 92%2. Ed WoodThese days, you almost can’t be an outsider artist of any real renown without having at least one reverent documentary to your name, but in the early 1990s, it would not have been unreasonable to assume that any biopic about Ed Wood — director of Plan 9 from Outer Space and other classics of unintentional humor — would arrive on the screen drenched in irony and coated in arch wit. Not so 1994’s Ed Wood, a loving tribute rendered by the hand of Tim Burton, whose reunion here with Johnny Depp helped the Edward Scissorhands star get over a boredom with acting that had begun to seep into his work. Burton’s version of Wood didn’t hew religiously close to the reported facts of the director’s life — and neither did the black-and-white production entice many filmgoers, racking up an appropriately Wood-sized $5.9 million gross — but critics appreciated the silver lining Burton saw in a frequently derided career, not to mention the relentless (albeit blind) optimism with which the director and star imbued their subject. Rolling Stone’s Peter Travers echoed the opinions of a majority of his peers when he wrote, “outrageously disjointed and just as outrageously entertaining, the picture stands as a successful outsider’s tribute to a failed kindred spirit.” 94%1. A Nightmare on Elm StreetBefore he broke hearts as Tom Hanson on 21 Jump Street, Johnny Depp was one of Freddy Krueger’s original victims, getting his first big break as Glen Lantz, the well-meaning but ultimately doomed boyfriend who tries to save Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) from the steel-tipped clutches of Springwood’s least favorite resident. He was one of a handful of actors (including Kevin Bacon and Crispin Glover) to get a leg up in the ’80s by taking an early paycheck for enduring a grisly on-screen demise, but Depp’s Nightmare exit was particularly gruesome, ending with his perfect hair and cheekbones crushed into a horrific fountain of blood and guts. A Nightmare on Elm Street‘s legacy has been tainted somewhat by the downward spiral of sequels that followed it, but at the time, it was really a breath of fresh air for a genre that desperately needed one — something Depp tacitly alluded to when he made a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo in 1991’s alleged series-ender, Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare. Despite subsequent installments’ inability to recapture its gory glory, the first Nightmare, in the words of ReelViews’ James Berardinelli, “still stands on its own as an intriguing and chilling example of how horror works best when the characters and the audience don’t have to be lobotomized.”In case you were wondering, here are Depp’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1.

With so many distinguished entries in his lengthy filmography, it was hard to narrow things down, but even if it presented us with some tough choices, this is one list of definitive films that truly lives up to its name.The Godfather, Part II (1974)  96%1972’s The Godfather&nbsp;was an instant classic, taking home three Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and earning universal critical acclaim — so even if The Godfather Part II&nbsp;had been an absolute failure, Francis Ford Coppola would have deserved credit for extreme chutzpah. Happily for all of us, this turned out to be the rare case where there was another film’s worth of story to tell. Working with Godfather author Mario Puzo, Coppola managed to add a prequel to the original (starring De Niro as a younger version of Vito Corleone) while continuing its story, and the result was a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for De Niro — and one of the very few must-see sequels in American film. “It has an even broader scope than the original,” observed Jeffrey M. Anderson for the San Francisco Examiner, “but does not fail in its depiction of small, intimate moments and surprising emotional reveals.”Watch TrailerTaxi Driver (1976)  96%Deeply unsettling and unrelentingly bleak, Taxi Driver&nbsp;captivated critics and audiences — and earned four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor — by plunging viewers into the waking nightmare of alienation, obsession, and violence experienced by its central character, troubled loner Travis Bickle. Not exactly family fare, in other words, but a film that very much reflected the disillusionment and general unease of its time — and that remains painfully relevant after several decades, as noted by the Apollo Guide’s Dan Jardine: “Its themes of urban decay, anomie and violence which infuse the impending sense of doom at the heart of this film still hang like black clouds over many cities today.”Watch TrailerThe Deer Hunter (1978)  92%De Niro picked up a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award nomination for his work in The Deer Hunter&nbsp;— one of nine nominations the film received against five wins, including Best Picture — continuing a critically acclaimed run that included his Oscar-winning appearances in The Godfather Part II&nbsp;and Raging Bull. Like those films, The Deer Hunter&nbsp;is a challenging, confrontational drama that poses uncomfortable questions in occasionally quite uncomfortable ways, using its main characters (played by De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage) to grapple with the ghosts of the Vietnam War and the uncertain economic climate in late ’70s America. “It has no more moral intelligence than the Clint Eastwood action pictures,” argued Pauline Kael for the New Yorker, “yet it’s an astonishing piece of work, an uneasy mixture of violent pulp and grandiosity, with an enraptured view of common life — poetry of the commonplace.”Watch TrailerRaging Bull (1980)  93%A viscerally violent, ruthlessly gripping, adrenaline-soaked depiction of one man’s self-destructive spiral, Raging Bull&nbsp;represents what can happen when a star believes in a project enough to fight for it — and when a director believes he’s down to his last chance at redemption, not only as a filmmaker but as a human being. De Niro won a Best Actor Oscar for his mesmerizing turn as real-life boxer Jake LaMotta, and it’s easy to understand why — even without the 70 pounds he packed on to play LaMotta’s post-retirement years, his commitment to the role is impossible to miss. Just as impressive is Scorsese’s work, which earned him a Best Director nomination (and the film a Best Picture nomination); this is a movie that presents a protagonist who is essentially unlikeable and wholly relatable in equal measure, and dares the viewer to look away. As Amy Taubin wrote for the Village Voice, “The most obvious basis for the film’s claim to greatness lies in Scorsese’s devastating critique of the very codes of masculinity that shaped him as a filmmaker, and in Robert De Niro’s performance, through which that critique is made flesh.”Watch TrailerOnce Upon a Time in America (1984)  87%Director Sergio Leone pursued Once Upon a Time in America&nbsp;through over a decade of development after falling in love with the source material, Harry Grey’s novel The Hoods, and at one point envisioned completing it as a pair of three-hour films — a fittingly expansive running time for the epic saga of a group of Jewish kids who rise from penny-ante hoods in 1920s Manhattan and later grow up to become key figures among the city’s organized crime element. Portraying main character David “Noodles” Aaronson, De Niro anchored a solid ensemble cast that also included James Woods and Elizabeth McGovern, but none of them were enough to overcome the array of edits faced by the film after Leone turned it in to the studio — including the American edit, which rearranged the storyline into chronological order and trimmed the whole thing down under two hours and 20 minutes. In more recent years, a restored 251-minute version has seen release, finally allowing audiences to experience a closer approximation of its director’s vision. As John Hartl wrote for Film.com, “Seeing what Leone always intended is like getting your dirty glasses washed.”Watch TrailerMidnight Run (1988)  94%Robert De Niro has always been a magnet for tough-guy roles, but he’s also very funny — and although he had an early opportunity to prove it with The King of Comedy, he flashed his comic chops in earnest with 1988’s Midnight Run, which found him playing a tightly wound bounty hunter who tracks down a mobster-swindling accountant (Charles Grodin), only to watch in exasperation as his supposedly easy gig unravels into a miserable odyssey of bickering, property destruction, and close calls with the wrong side of the law. But at the box office, things only went right for Run, where it earned more than $80 million — and it performed just as well with critics like Luke Y. Thompson of the New Times, who wrote, “When it comes to odd-couple action comedies, this is pretty much the epitome of how to do it.”Watch TrailerGoodFellas (1990)  96%De Niro reunited with Martin Scorsese — as well as his Raging Bull&nbsp;and Once Upon a Time in America&nbsp;costar, Joe Pesci — for this masterfully frenetic look at life in the Mafia through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a onetime mobster who rose through the ranks as a young man before famously turning informant in the early ‘80s. Scorsese employed a stellar ensemble cast for Goodfellas, including a number of future stars (among them Samuel L. Jackson), but the movie’s real draw came from the terrible true story at its center, and how convincingly the seductive pull of the criminal lifestyle was portrayed. “You walk away,” wrote Richard Schickel for TIME Magazine, “tantalized by a view into the darkest part of yourself, glad that that part is still behind bars.”Watch TrailerA Bronx Tale (1993)  97%De Niro made his directorial debut with this mob-themed coming-of-age drama, adapted by Chazz Palminteri (who also starred) from his one-man Broadway show. As Lorenzo Anello, the upstanding, no-nonsense father of a boy who continually finds himself drawn into the orbit of a local gangster (Palminteri), De Niro was able to play another side of a story he’d helped tell on numerous occasions before — and while it wasn’t a major commercial success during its theatrical run, it earned praise from most critics, including Clint Morris of Film Threat, who called it “a superb debut and “a gripping movie” and arguing, “De Niro proves to be just as much a force behind the camera as he does in front of it.”Watch TrailerHeat (1995)  87%The ensemble heist thriller that most ensemble heist thrillers wish they were, Michael Mann’s Heat&nbsp;would have been noteworthy even if all it did was bring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino together for a few scenes. Happily, the movie’s much more than that: Mann juggles his incredible cast (which also included Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, and Jon Voight) as deftly as he manages the many moving parts in a storyline pitting a dogged cop who’s sacrificed his family for his career (Pacino) against a notorious criminal (De Niro), topping the whole thing off with stellar cinematography that makes Los Angeles look positively incredible. “Just when it seemed that the only hope for crime movies lay in the postmodernist artifice of films like Pulp Fiction, Mann reinvests the genre with brooding, modernist conviction,” applauded Newsweek’s David Ansen. “This one sticks to your gut.”Watch TrailerSilver Linings Playbook (2012)  92%On the whole, De Niro had a fairly grim 2012 at the box office, appearing in a string of duds that spanned the genre spectrum from dark thriller (Red Lights) to light comedy (New Year’s Eve). But there was a gem in this rough patch: David O. Russell’s Silver Linings Playbook, the Oscar-winning dramedy about a troubled teacher (Bradley Cooper) who develops an unexpected friendship with a young neighborhood widow (Jennifer Lawrence) after he’s institutionalized following the collapse of his marriage. De Niro’s appearance as Cooper’s Philadelphia Eagles-loving dad was unquestionably a supporting role, but one that required a surprising amount of dramatic heavy lifting — which the old master proved ready and willing to provide. “I suppose the phrase ‘serious romantic comedy’ sounds like a paradox,” admitted Linda Cook of the Quad City Times, “but that’s exactly what Silver Linings Playbook is: an intelligent, edgy dark comedy with romance at its core.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"HBO, spanish, versus","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20143756/RobertDeNiro.jpg","slug":"definitive-robert-de-niro-movies"},{"id":"47508966903166","title":"10 Awesome Video Games That Were Made Into Terrible Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Awesome Video Games That Were Made Into Terrible MoviesIn this installment of Total Recall, we look at some of Hollywood's worst attempts to bring video games to the big screen.by Jeff Giles | July 22, 2015 |  CommentsAs film fans know, video games have been used to inflict pain and senseless brutality at the cineplex for years now. In honor of that miserable tradition, we elected to devote this feature to a look back at some of the least entertaining game-to-film adaptations Hollywood’s ever produced, and while there was definitely no shortage of contenders, we narrowed it down to a particularly pungent few while making room for plenty of variety (in other words, only one Uwe Boll film made the list). Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start: It’s time for Total Recall!Alone in the Dark (2005)  1%(Photo by Lionsgate/Courtesy Everett Collection)Here’s where we admit what many of you have known all along: If we’d done things a little differently, this list could have been largely comprised of Uwe Boll movies. For whatever reason, Mr. Boll has displayed a deep affinity for video game adaptations over the course of his remarkable career, and the “bad game movie” subgenre’s byways are clogged with the effluvia of his cinematic efforts. In the interest of variety, however, we decided to limit his appearances here, leaving us with one obvious choice: 2005’s Alone in the Dark, an alleged sci-fi thriller starring Christian Slater as a paranormal detective and Tara Reid as a scientist — both of whom are investigating the disappearance of an ancient civilization that prayed to space demons. Extremely loosely based on the&nbsp;Alone in the Dark&nbsp;game series — which was itself loosely based on H.P. Lovecraft’s writings — the movie found itself alone in the dark with scores of sparsely populated theaters playing host to scornful critics like the San Francisco Examiner’s Rossiter Drake, who guffawed, “The late Gene Siskel once devised a simple method of measuring a film’s worth: ‘Is this film more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?’ Alone in the Dark&nbsp;doesn’t come close to matching that standard.”Watch TrailerDoom (2005)  18%(Photo by Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection)He has since ascended to “franchise Viagra” status, but Dwayne Johnson’s early years as a Hollywood action hero were a little bumpy. After his breakout appearance in The Mummy Returns, he struggled to find a solid fit for his beefy build and natural screen charisma, occasionally turning in critically lauded performances in box-office misses (The Rundown) or working overtime to prop up misguided action flicks (Walking Tall). 2005’s Doom&nbsp;falls into the latter category, repurposing the hugely popular first-person shooter as a sci-fi thriller about a crew of soldiers sent to rescue a colony on Mars after residents accidentally open a portal to Hell and unleash a horde of murderous creatures. While the film included plenty of the tunnel-bound warfare that fans of the game had come to expect, the end result was — as critics would repeatedly point out regarding plenty of like-minded pictures over the years — more fun to play than to watch. “Doom,” pointed out Roger Ebert, “is like some kid came over and is using your computer and won’t let you play.”Watch TrailerDouble Dragon (1994)  13%(Photo by GramercyPictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;How do you make a movie out of a game based on nothing more than a pair of brothers pummeling the bejeesus out of bad guys? If you’re Double Dragon&nbsp;screenwriters Michael Davis and Peter Gould, the unfortunate answer is “come up with a convoluted story involving halves of a mystical amulet” — and things only went downhill from there, after director James Yukich built a cast that included future Party of Five&nbsp;veteran Scott Wolf and former Who’s the Boss?&nbsp;star Alyssa Milano. The result was a deeply hokey 90 minutes of low-budget chop-socky action that provoked near-universal guffaws from critics like Luke Y. Thompson of the New Times, who wondered, “How hard would it be to come up with a story at least as good as that of the original Nintendo game? Impossible, apparently.”Watch TrailerHitman (2007)  16%(Photo by 20th Century Fox/Courtesy Everett Collection)There have been so many lame game-to-film adaptations that it can be tempting to believe there’s simply no point in trying to bridge the two mediums, but there really are video games that look like they might make good movies; unfortunately, as 2007’s Hitman&nbsp;proved, even the most cinematic backstory doesn’t necessarily mean a polished final product. Starring Timothy Olyphant as Agent 47, a member of an army of bald and bar-coded assassins who finds himself double-crossed by the shadowy organization that trained him from birth to kill, it looked on paper like just the sort of globe-trotting action thriller that might keep 007 fans satisfied between Bond sequels — yet the end result was a picture every bit as smoothly anonymous as its protagonist. A planned sequel was scrapped, and although Hitman’s $99 million box office tally ensured an eventual reboot (due in August) that might do a better job of distilling the game’s appeal, the original is still a case of sadly wasted potential. “47 doesn’t even want the girl,” pointed out a frustrated Tricia Olszewski for the Washington City Paper. “What kind of action movie is this? A skippable one, ultimately.”Watch TrailerMax Payne (2008)  16%(Photo by 20th Century Fox/Courtesy Everett Collection)For a certain breed of filmgoer, all you really need to make an entertaining movie is hand Mark Wahlberg a gun. Max Payne, director John Moore’s adaptation of the hit video game series about a vigilante cop gunning for justice after the murders of his wife, child, and partner, was made exactly for those people and pretty much no one else — with the possible exception of Sin City&nbsp;fans who want to watch a movie that wishes it could be Sin City, or maybe noir enthusiasts who feel the genre needs more murderous winged man-creatures. For just about everyone else, Max Payne&nbsp;is a painfully misguided hash of “gritty” action and digital effects, all directed within an inch of its life; as Michael Phillips wrote for the Chicago Tribune, “You find yourself rooting against Payne’s survival, even with a good actor in the hollow role. There’s nothing inside the film’s sour, slovenly spirit of vengeance.”Watch TrailerMortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997)  2%(Photo by New Line Cinema/Courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;The first Mortal Kombat&nbsp;may not have been a major work of cinematic art, but it had its moments, and overall made for a pleasantly undemanding afternoon of chop-socky entertainment with mystical mumbo-jumbo overtones — and it was rewarded for achieving those limited goals with a surprising run of box office domination and a gross approaching $125 million. Sadly, little of that fun — or the original cast — remained by the time Mortal Kombat: Annihilation&nbsp;arrived in theaters, and the result was a box office bomb that put the nascent Kombat&nbsp;franchise into a development deep freeze from which, at the time of this writing, it’s still struggling to escape. “Never — at least not since the first Mortal Kombat,” sighed the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Steven Rea, “has tedium been so loud, so full of backward flips and flying fists to the kissers of centaurs from another realm.”Watch TrailerSilent Hill: Revelation (2012)  10%(Photo by Kerry Hayes/Open Road Films/Courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;Critics pooped all over the first Silent Hill&nbsp;movie, but it made nearly $100 million anyway, so six years later we were treated to Silent Hill: Revelation, which picked up after the events of the first film (but followed the plot of the Silent Hill 3&nbsp;video game) by following the harrowing new exploits suffered by Christopher Da Silva (a returning Sean Bean) and his adopted daughter Sharon (Adelaide Clemens) after her mother (Radha Mitchell) is trapped in a sinister ghost dimension. It’s a premise with a certain spine-tingling promise; alas, very little of it translated to the screen, and Silent Hill: Revelation&nbsp;ended up grossing roughly half of what the original made. “It’s never a good sign,” groaned Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times, “when the trailers playing before a film have richer, more complete narratives than the feature you’ve paid to see.”Watch TrailerStreet Fighter (1994)  13%(Photo by MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;Given Street Fighter’s lowly reputation, one would hardly guess it made nearly $100 million during its box office run, but that’s the risk a filmmaker runs when he puts a beanie on Jean-Claude Van Damme and casts Raul Julia as a bizarre military dictator — and that’s exactly the sort of infamy that awaited this misbegotten attempt to turn mountains of arcade quarters into box office glory. As with Double Dragon, one of the chief problems was that of plot — specifically, how to spin one out of a game that revolved more or less solely around people beating each other up — and writer-director Steven de Souza compensated by imagining a surreal standoff between the megalomaniacal M. Bison (Julia) and a Megaforce-style military force dubbed the Allied Nations. We could delve into the narrative further, but the end result would be the same: Plenty of silly fight scenes and a heaping helping of horrible reviews from critics like Stephen Holden of the New York Times, who dismissed Street Fighter&nbsp;as “A dreary, overstuffed hodgepodge of poorly edited martial arts sequences and often unintelligible dialogue.”Watch TrailerSuper Mario Bros. (1993)  26%(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;We all knew this was going to make the list, right? The grandaddy of all game-to-film box office bombs, 1990’s Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;was supposed to be gaming’s Hollywood coming-out party — proof that not only had video games truly arrived as entertainment with real staying power, but that gamers were an audience just waiting to be tapped by film studios who could make millions bringing pre-existing franchises to the big screen. All of which sounds great, but fails to take into account the fact that directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel were trying to make a movie out of a game about sibling plumbers who run through a series of bizarre worlds in pursuit of a princess who’s been captured by a giant turtle, and who have to battle an insane menagerie of villains (including sentient mushrooms) along the way. After an extensive casting search that included attempts to lure in Danny DeVito, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Tom Hanks, the filmmakers eventually hired Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo to play brothers Mario and Luigi, while Dennis Hopper agreed to portray the villainous humanoid reptile-thing King Koopa, but all the acting talent in the world couldn’t have made a dent in the cacophonous mess that is Super Mario Bros., which turned out to be such a critical and commercial dud that the game’s developer, Nintendo, swore off film adaptations for decades. “Kids might get a charge out of the mayhem,” groaned the Charlotte Observer’s Lawrence Toppman. “I got the vapors.”Watch TrailerWing Commander (1999)  10%(Photo by 20th Century Fox/Courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;By the late ‘90s, Matthew Lillard and Freddie Prinze, Jr. were ready to graduate from teen romcoms… which they signaled, unfortunately, by signing up for the disastrous big-screen adaptation of Wing Commander, which found them trying in vain to wring big-screen thrills out of a hokey story involving a future interstellar war between humans and an alien race of catlike bipeds. It’s a premise that sounds thoroughly silly to Commander&nbsp;novices, and director Chris Roberts compounded the problem by making several key changes to the game’s characters and mythology that alienated core gamers who might have otherwise turned out for the film. Observed Anita Gates for the New York Times, “Wing Commander&nbsp;is based on a video game and has roughly the same degree of character development. That is all most moviegoers will need to know.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Studios, FX, die, talk, theme, e., Comic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/12174031/Bad-Video-Game-Movies-Recall.jpg","slug":"10-awesome-video-games-that-were-made-into-terrible-movies"},{"id":"47508964111716","title":"Definitive Ice Cube Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Ice Cube MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we take a look at the films that helped define the Ride Along 2 star's career.by Jeff Giles | January 13, 2016 |  CommentsBy the time he celebrated his 20th birthday, Ice Cube had already helped found — and had departed — one of the most influential rap groups of all time. But as we soon learned, his time with N.W.A. was only the beginning: Cube quickly went on to start an acclaimed solo career, and with 1991’s Boyz N the Hood, established himself as a force to be reckoned with on the big screen. Since then, he’s amassed an eclectic filmography — one with room for action, dramas, comedies, and family-friendly fare, and plenty of critical highs and lows to match. With his latest release, Ride Along 2, appearing in theaters this weekend, we decided to take a look back at some definitive entries in Cube’s film oeuvre. It’s time for Total Recall!Boyz n the Hood (1991)  94%He wrote the song from which the movie takes its name, so it’s only appropriate that Ice Cube’s film debut should come as part of John Singleton’s 1991 breakthrough, Boyz N the Hood. What no one could have guessed, though, was just how effective Cube would be as Darrin “Doughboy” Baker, the Crip-affiliated ex-con who chooses to remain in his violent lifestyle, no matter how profound the consequences might be. An auspicious debut for Singleton — who earned an Oscar nomination — Boyz&nbsp;promised great things for Cube’s acting career, and earned the respect of critics like Netflix’s James Rocchi, who called it “remarkable — a film full of political discussion and thought that also manages to involve us in the real, human lives of its characters.”Watch TrailerTrespass (1992)  69%After the bloated misfire of 1990’s Another 48 Hrs., director Walter Hill needed a project that would get him back to basics, and he found it in Trespass, an urban update on The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&nbsp;that pitted two firefighters (Bill Paxton and William Sadler) against a gangster (Ice-T) and his bloodthirsty lieutenant (Ice Cube). Unapologetically nihilistic and gleefully violent, Trespass&nbsp;presaged future Hill vehicles like Last Man Standing&nbsp;(right down to the Ry Cooder soundtrack), with the added advantage of a cast filled with comically gifted character actors. Calling it “Claustrophobic, taut and efficient,” Chris Hicks of the Deseret News wrote, “like a streamlined car designed to simply get you there, Trespass&nbsp;wastes no time in setting up its premise — and then just barrels along with an in-your-face attitude and plenty of tightly wound tension.”Watch TrailerThe Glass Shield (1994)  65%As he had with Boyz N the Hood&nbsp;— and would go on to do with Higher Learning&nbsp;— Ice Cube helped tackle racially charged topics in The Glass Shield, a police drama from director Charles Burnett about a rookie cop (Michael Boatman) who becomes the first black cop at an all-white station just in time to become involved in the wrongful prosecution of a murder suspect (Cube). Grossing a little over $3 million during its limited release, Shield slid under the radar, despite a cast that also included Lori Petty — but for a number of critics, it represented another solid entry in Burnett’s filmography. As Marjori Baumgarten summed it up for the Austin Chronicle, “Though The Glass Shield&nbsp;gets bogged down in some of its narrative byways, the journey, nonetheless, is rich and rewarding.”Watch TrailerFriday (1995)  78%How many laughs can you get out of a premise that basically revolves around a pair of unemployed twentysomethings sitting on the front porch? Ask anyone who’s seen Friday. Co-written by Cube and DJ Pooh, this low-budget cult classic follows the adventures of Craig (Cube) and Smokey (Chris Tucker) as they spend a Friday scrambling to come up with $200 to pay off Big Worm, the local dealer/ice cream man. A surprise (albeit minor) hit, Friday&nbsp;spawned a film and TV franchise — all of them unfortunately without Tucker, whose frenetic screen presence and easy comic chemistry with Cube helped jump-start his film career. Puffing new life into the moribund stoner comedy genre, it also earned the approval of scribes like eFilmCritic’s Scott Weinberg, who called it “an energetic and genuinely funny low-budget flick” and wrote, “This is why we wade through all the really bad ones; to find the unexpected pieces of comedy gold.”Watch TrailerHigher Learning (1994)  45%Cube reunited with Boyz N the Hood&nbsp;director John Singleton for 1995’s Higher Learning, an ensemble drama about racial and sexual tensions in mid ‘90s America, as seen and embodied through a diverse group of college students. As a black nationalist nicknamed Fudge, Cube gave voice to much of the movie’s political subtext, and provided a counterpoint to the unfocused rage of white supremacist Remy (Michael Rapaport). Learning’s thorny themes gave Singleton a lot to move through in a two-hour movie, and as far as most critics were concerned, he didn’t go deep enough — but others were simply happy to see a film with a message. As Todd McCarthy wrote for Variety, “Higher Learning&nbsp;has a great many things on its mind, which immediately places it in a rather exclusive category of American films these days.”Watch TrailerAnaconda (1997)  37%Say what you will about Ice Cube’s script choices in general — or about 1997’s Anaconda&nbsp;in particular — but when Luis Llosa was casting this B-movie spectacular and looking for someone to play Danny Rich, the baddest documentary cameraman on the Amazon, there was really only one man for the part. Who besides Ice Cube can look equally at home wielding a lens and chopping a giant anaconda to death with an axe? And sure, this is a silly flick — but at least it embraces the silliness. As Lisa Schwarzbaum put it in her review for Entertainment Weekly, “Anaconda, directed by Luis Llosa with all of the subtlety of a snake-oil salesman, is in the great tradition of cinematic cheese, as processed as Kraft Singles slices.”Watch TrailerThree Kings (1999)  94%Combining dark political satire with a good old-fashioned heist flick, David O. Russell’s Three Kings&nbsp;starred George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and (of course) Ice Cube as disillusioned Gulf War soldiers who plan to abscond with Kuwaiti gold in what seems like the perfect heist. Things don’t quite turn out that way, of course, but as the plan unfolds, Kings&nbsp;unloads some unflinching commentary on the war’s motivations and aftermath. For Ice Cube, it was a chance to prove his mettle with a solid cast, talented director, and terrific script; for critics, it offered a rare opportunity to see a gripping action movie with something to say. As Roger Ebert put it, “It has the freedom and recklessness of Oliver Stone or Robert Altman in their mad-dog days, and a visual style that hungers for impact.”Watch TrailerBarbershop (2002)  83%Ice Cube anchored an ensemble cast of character actors (like Keith David) and comedians (like Anthony Anderson) for this seriocomic look at a day in the life of disgruntled barbershop owner Calvin Palmer (Cube), who’s happy to sell his failing business to a local loan shark (David) — until he realizes what its disappearance will mean to his employees and the community at large. Like a number of Cube’s other efforts, Barbershop&nbsp;deals frankly with racial taboos, but it leavens its message with plenty of sharp laughs; it proved a potent combination at the box office, where the movie’s $77 million gross sparked a sequel, a spinoff, and a television series. It was popular with critics, too, among them Ty Burr of the Boston Globe, who called it “a broad, very funny, unexpectedly graceful comedy of character and community.”Watch TrailerThe Longshots (2008)  41%Ice Cube hasn’t always had the best luck with family films (Are We There Yet?&nbsp;and Are We Done Yet?&nbsp;being prime examples), and when word got out that he’d be starring in an inspirational sports drama directed by Fred Durst, it seemed safe to assume that The Longshots would be more of the same. While far from successful either critically or financially, this fact-based movie — about the obstacles overcome by Jasmine Plummer (Keke Palmer) to play in the Pop Warner Super Bowl — proved a pleasant surprise for some, including Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times, who mused, “The Longshots&nbsp;is a likable enough Cinderella story, one whose heart is clearly in the right place, even if it winds up on its sleeve once too often.”Watch TrailerThe Jump Street FranchiseEvery good police show needs a tough-as-nails captain barking orders back at the station, and for the majority of 21 Jump Street‘s five-season run, that role was filled by Steven Williams, whose knack for playing tough guys with a heart made him the perfect top cop for Johnny Depp and the gang. Williams left big shoes to fill when the series made its Jump&nbsp;to the big screen, but Ice Cube proved the perfect replacement, infusing his coarse Captain Dickson with a familiar (albeit slightly more profane) variation on his predecessor’s brand of no-nonsense menace. He reprised his role in 22 Jump Street, once again futilely attempting to rein in the madcap antics of Detectives Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum), and he’ll presumably be back again when the series makes its inevitable return with 23 Jump Street.Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Disney, versus, boxing, shows, zombies, The, cancelled, Plus, Sabrina, HBO, scorecard, what, criterion, ABC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13143228/IceCube.jpg","slug":"definitive-ice-cube-movies"},{"id":"47508967008650","title":"Best and Worst Movies of the Furious 7 Stars","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Best and Worst Movies of the Furious 7 StarsIn this week's Total Recall, we run the best and worst films of the franchise's stars.by Jeff Giles | April 1, 2015 |  CommentsIt remains to be seen whether this weekend’s Furious 7 will really be “one last ride” for the franchise, but just in case, we’ve decided to pay tribute to our favorite cinematic rubber-burners by taking a look at the best and worst entries from each cast member’s filmography. This is going to be a bumpy ride, so buckle up – it’s time for Total Recall!.editcolumns{float:left;border-bottom:1px solid #eee;margin-bottom:80px}.cola,.colb{width:350px;overflow:hidden;float:left;padding:0 20px 30px 0}.cola{margin-right:3px}h2.bestworst{background-repeat:no-repeat;width:350px;padding:15px 0 15px 110px}.colb h2.bestworst{padding-left:130px}@media only screen and (max-device-width:480px){.cola,.colb{width:320px!important}.cola img,.colb img{width:320px!important}}Vin Diesel97% &nbsp;The Iron GiantLong before Diesel made audiences laugh, cheer, and shed a tear as the monosyllabic Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy, he proved his unique worth as an animated galoot in The Iron Giant, suffusing director Brad Bird’s future cult classic with immense poignancy simply by speaking a handful of lines. We still can’t hear the word “Superman” without choking up.6% &nbsp;Babylon A.D.Diesel has more than proven his ability to play gun-toting strong, silent types, as well as his comfort with acting to green-screened futuristic landscapes; Babylon A.D., which pitted his grizzled mercenary character against a psychotic Russian mobster played by Gerard Depardieu, should by all rights have been a lot of fun. Alas, if it’s dystopian Diesel you’re after, you should definitely stick with the Chronicles of Riddick movies.Paul Walker85% &nbsp;PleasantvilleWhile Walker ultimately became best known for his action roles, his wholesome good looks might have made him a terrific rom-com leading man – and as he demonstrated as all-around swell guy Skip Martin in Pleasantville, he also had more than enough charm and sincerity to pull it off. Being able to say “you’re the keenest girl in school” with a straight face? That’s a gift, people.4% &nbsp;Meet the DeedlesArguably the most violent act perpetrated against Hawaiian culture since Pearl Harbor, Meet the Deedles starred Walker as one-half of a sibling surfer duo whose idiot antics convince their father (soap legend Eric Braeden) to ship them off to Yellowstone, where they bumble into a plot cooked up by a renegade ranger (Dennis Hopper) who plans to divert Old Faithful. Possibly worth watching if you are related to one of the former members of Oingo Boingo who make a cameo appearance.Michelle Rodriguez87% &nbsp;GirlfightRodriguez set a fairly high bar for herself with her breakout performance in this highly regarded indie drama about a troubled teenager who learns to channel her aggression in the ring, which also launched the career of writer-director Karyn Kusama – who wrote the screenplay inspired by her own boxing lessons. Not only was Rodriguez not a boxer before winning the role, she’d never even landed a speaking part in a film. The rest is history.4% &nbsp;BloodRayneDirected by Uwe Boll. We could say more, but what would be the point, really?Dwayne Johnson79% &nbsp;The Other GuysPlenty of action stars have subverted their tough-guy personas, but few do it as effortlessly as Johnson, whose blinding charisma is so powerful he managed to emerge from The Tooth Fairy unscathed. (More on that in a minute.) His brief appearance in The Other Guys is a terrific example: Alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Johnson played a meathead star cop with an arrest record as sparkly as his toothy grin – and an unfortunate inability to comprehend or overcome the law of gravity.18% &nbsp;The Tooth FairyDwayne Johnson as a brutally violent hockey player who’s cowed into deputy tooth fairy duty by an enraged Julie Andrews (and supplied with fairy magic by Billy Crystal)? It seems like the stuff that legendary comedies are made of, but unfortunately, Tooth Fairy lacked a certain (ahem) biting wit. On the bright side, it’s still more fun than the direct-to-video sequel starring Larry the Cable Guy and a pig.Ludacris82% &nbsp;Hustle &amp; FlowAdmittedly, playing a multiplatinum rapper wasn’t exactly a dramatic stretch for Ludacris, but his appearance as Skinny Black helped personify the level of success that Hustle &amp; Flow protagonist DJay (Terrence Howard) was trying to attain – as well as the barriers he had to struggle against in pursuit of his dream. It is, as they say, hard out here for a pimp.8% &nbsp;The WashThere’s a certain amount of mildly anarchic potential inherent in the idea of a car wash-centered comedy starring some of hip-hop’s biggest stars – but for a movie like The Wash to really work, it should ideally be managed by someone with more filmmaking experience than writer-producer-director DJ Pooh, whose nickname summed up the critical and commercial reaction to the project. Fortunately for Ludacris, his involvement was limited; while headlining stars Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg loomed large over the credits, he was content to serve walk-on duty as an irate character credited only as “Customer”.Tyrese Gibson85% &nbsp;The TakeGibson hasn’t had an overabundance of opportunities to shine outside the Fast and Furious franchise, but he did enjoy a piece of the critical spotlight for The Take, a relatively little-seen 2007 thriller about an armored car driver (John Leguizamo) gunning for vengeance against the criminal (Gibson) who masterminded a robbery that left him disgraced and close to death.10% &nbsp;AnnapolisPlenty of worthwhile stories have been spun out of the conflict between young military officers and their hard-driving superiors, but Annapolis – starring James Franco whose hostile relationship with his commander (Gibson) spills over into the boxing ring – is emphatically not one of them. On the bright side, it introduced Gibson to Annapolis director Justin Lin, who he’d later work with on Fast Five and Fast &amp; Furious 6.Lucas Black96% &nbsp;Sling BladeAfter picking up his first film role in the 1994 Kevin Costner/Elijah Wood drama The War, Black made his breakout with Sling Blade, starring opposite Billy Bob Thornton as a young boy who develops an unlikely friendship with a developmentally disabled killer. Thornton won an Oscar for his screenplay, while Black picked up a few accolades of his own, including a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor.14% &nbsp;Seven Days in UtopiaAs an actor, lining yourself up opposite Robert Duvall is basically winning half the battle; sadly for Lucas Black in Seven Days in Utopia, the outcome of the other half depends on stuff like a solid direction and a great screenplay. As far as most critics were concerned, neither of those crucial components were in evidence in this faith-based drama, about a young golfer (Black) whose career crisis is defused by the sage advice of an older, wiser friend (Duvall) ? but fortunately, Utopia proved little more than a blip for either actor, both of whom quickly went on to greener cinematic pastures.Jason Statham79% &nbsp;The Bank JobLike any action star, Statham has plenty of shoot-’em-up duds on his résumé, but as his steely work on The Bank Job illustrates, he’s a terrific tough guy if he hasn’t been left holding the bag for a shoddy script. Based in part on real events, Job boasts a tightwire-taut narrative and witty dialogue to go along with its action sequences; years later, we’re still waiting for someone to hand this guy the keys to a truly transcendent franchise.4% &nbsp;In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege TaleWe repeat: Directed by Uwe Boll. We like to think Statham and Rodriguez may have shared a knowing smile or two on the Fast and Furious set.Kurt Russell92% &nbsp;Swing ShiftGiven all the hits he’s had during his distinguished career, it comes as something of a surprise to learn that Kurt Russell’s best-reviewed movie is a period dramedy about a war bride (Goldie Hawn) who falls into the arms of a musician (Russell) while working at a factory during her husband’s overseas service. But even if it doesn’t have the kind of cult following enjoyed by Escape from New York or Big Trouble in Little China, Swing Shift is still a pretty excellent film – and if nothing else, it helped kindle his decades-long love affair with Hawn.10% &nbsp;SoldierMost viewers have relatively relaxed standards when it comes to the action sci-fi genre, but even in that context, 1998’s Soldier – starring Russell as a monosyllabic space warrior known as Sergeant Todd 3465 – scrapes the bottom of the barrel in terms of interesting dialogue, character development, or exciting set pieces. Viewed by its screenwriter, Blade Runner co-writer David Peoples, as a “sidequel” to that Philip K. Dick-derived classic, it’s exactly the kind of movie that used to collect dust on the shelf of your local video store…and has rarely been thought of since.Read more Total RecallFurious 7 reviews","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Freeform, Adult","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/toothfairy.jpg","slug":"best-and-worst-movies-of-the-furious-7-stars"},{"id":"47508968816016","title":"Danny DeVito’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Danny DeVito's 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the All the Wilderness star.by Jeff Giles | February 18, 2015 |  CommentsDanny DeVito has been in a pair of long-running sitcoms, produced and directed some major hit movies, and turned in notable cameos in some of the most critically adored films of all time (including One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Terms of Endearment) — and all those achievements don’t even include most of his filmography, which expands this week to include his appearance in All the Wilderness. Clearly, this is the perfect time to pay tribute, and that’s exactly why we decided to (ahem) DeVote this list to the irascible, irrepressible Mr. DeVito. It’s time for Total Recall!10. Tin Men (1987)  77%After leaving the city for The Natural and Young Sherlock Holmes, Diner director Barry Levinson returned to Baltimore with 1987’s Tin Men, a downbeat comedy about a pair of aluminum siding salesmen (DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss) who begin a bitter, decades-long rivalry after (literally) bumping into each other during a disastrous first meeting in the ’40s. Boasting fine period detail, a terrific cast that also included Barbara Hershey, John Mahoney, and Bruno Kirby, and soundtrack work from the Fine Young Cannibals, Tin Men impressed critics like Luke Y. Thompson of New Times, who called it “Primo Levinson” and wrote, “DeVito’s rarely been more human, and Dreyfuss is at his funniest.”Watch Trailer9. Batman Returns (1992)  80%Initially reluctant to film a Batman sequel, Tim Burton was eventually persuaded to return to Gotham after wresting complete creative control from Warner Bros. The result was 1992’s Batman Returns, a casting dream that found Batman (Michael Keaton, donning the cowl for the final time) facing off against Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer, resplendent in leather) and the Penguin (a scenery-chewing DeVito). Though some critics (and parents) felt the film was too dark, most reviews were positive; in fact, before Christopher Nolan came along with Batman Begins, Batman Returns was the best-reviewed film in the franchise, something Desson Thompson of the Washington Post attributed to the fact that it “comes closer than ever to Bob Kane’s dark, original strip, which began in 1939.”Watch Trailer8. The War of the Roses (1989)  85%DeVito and his Romancing the Stone castmates Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner teamed up for the third time in this pitch-black comedy about a wealthy married couple (Douglas and Turner) whose disintegrating marriage becomes a desperate, violent squabble over their shared possessions. Doing double duty as director and co-star, DeVito extended his directorial hot streak (begun with 1987’s Throw Momma from the Train), while Douglas and Turner took the love/hate banter they perfected during Stone and Jewel of the Nile and subtracted the love, fueling one of the most entertainingly venomous divorces in cinematic history. As Rob Vaux of the Flipside Movie Emporium put it, “For anyone who ever spent Valentine’s Day alone with a bottle of scotch, for anyone who ever watched the love of their life go stomping out the door, for anyone who ever gazed in hatred at the happy couple spooning in public? This is the movie for you.”Watch Trailer7. The Rainmaker (1997)  82%John Grisham has seen plenty of his books turned into movies, but in 2004, he told Entertainment Weekly that The Rainmaker was the best. It’s easy to understand why: with Francis Ford Coppola behind the cameras and an ace cast that included Matt Damon, Mickey Rourke, Jon Voight, and DeVito, it’d be hard to ask for a more skillfully assembled adaptation of the story of an idealistic young lawyer (Damon) who teams up with a resourceful paralegal (DeVito) to bring down an unscrupulous health insurance company. Although it failed to outgross many of them, it was, as Empire’s Ian Nathan argued, “A stronger bet than the previous 35 or however many Grisham movies before it.”Watch Trailer6. Hercules (1997)  84%Before he was the Lorax, DeVito lent his pipes to Disney’s Hercules, appearing as the voice of the pugnacious satyr tasked with toughening up the titular Olympian (Tate Donovan) and assisting him in his quest to prove his worth as a true hero. Crafty and incorrigible, Phil gave DeVito the opportunity to walk away with many of the movie’s best lines — and entertained critics like Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote, “Light on its feet and continually amusing, this free-spirited show-biz version of Greek mythology ranks with the best of modern Disney animation.”Watch Trailer5. Get Shorty (1995)  88%DeVito strapped on his producer’s hat for Get Shorty, a $115 million adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel about a loan shark (John Travolta) who dreams of leaving the business and turning his life story into a hit film for a big-time Hollywood star (DeVito). Sharp, funny, and stocked with an impeccable array of talented actors, including Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, and Dennis Farina, Shorty entertained critics and audiences alike — including Newsweek’s David Ansen, who pointed out, “Hollywood has been in love with mobsters since the beginning of movies. But the other side of the equation has seldom been considered. That is, until now.”Watch Trailer4. Romancing the Stone (1984)  85%Nobody plays “gleefully unscrupulous” quite like Danny DeVito, and he was given free rein with Robert Zemeckis’ Romancing the Stone, which found him playing a shady antique smuggler whose bumbling plot to get his hands on a treasure map put him at odds with a romance novelist (Kathleen Turner), a dashing explorer (Michael Douglas), and a murderous Colombian colonel (Manuel Ojeda). Loads of swashbuckling fun in a perfectly ’80s way, Stone raised more than $86 million at the box office, spawned a sequel, and won the admiration of critics like Tim Brayton of Antagony &amp; Ecstasy, who called it “A grand example of the rarest combination of adventure, humor, and sexual chemistry which all crackle along with abandon.”Watch Trailer3. Matilda (1996)  90%For his first directorial effort since 1992’s Hoffa, DeVito did something altogether different: an adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel Matilda, about a bright young girl (Mara Wilson) with loathsome parents (played by DeVito and Rhea Perlman) and a budding set of telekinetic abilities. Dahl’s flair for dark storytelling was a perfect fit for DeVito’s sensibilities, and the result was a modest hit greeted by appreciative reviews from critics like Rob Thomas of Madison’s Capital Times, who wrote, “DeVito gleefully preserves Dahl’s dark comic tone, which should delight both kids and parents.”Watch Trailer2. Ruthless People (1986)  93%An ’80s spin on O. Henry’s Ransom of Red Chief courtesy of the Zucker/Abrams/Zucker laugh factory, Ruthless People gave DeVito one of his most marvelously grotesque roles: Sam Stone, the millionaire fashion magnate who’s planning to murder his equally off-putting wife (Bette Midler) when she’s kidnapped by a vengeful fashion designer (Helen Slater) and her doltish boyfriend (Judge Reinhold). Seeing an opportunity to have his dirty work done for him, Stone cheerfully neglects to pay the ransom, setting in motion a chain of hateful behavior. “DeVito is the mainspring of Ruthless People, the engine of murderous intensity right at the center,” observed Roger Ebert. “His passion is so palpable that it adds weight to all the other performances in the movie.”Watch Trailer1. L.A. Confidential (1997)  99%Danny DeVito almost certainly isn’t the first actor that comes to mind when you think of L.A. Confidential — that honor most likely goes to Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, or Kim Basinger — but his character, publishing sleazemonger Sid Hudgens, was still crucial to the story, setting in motion some key moments in the storyline and serving as the film’s narrator. And while this might not be the definitive performance in DeVito’s career, it does illustrate his gift for choosing the right script; as Variety’s Todd McCarthy wrote, this Best Picture nominee is “An irresistible treat with enough narrative twists and memorable characters for a half-dozen films.”Watch TrailerFinally, here’s DeVito squaring off against Oscar the Grouch in a series of visits to Sesame Street:Check out Danny DeVito’s complete filmography.Read more Total Recall.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"dceu, PBS, Holiday, ABC, hidden, spider-man, Fresh, crime, ghosts, Kimmy, TV, critic, TV, news, reviews","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Danny-DeVito.jpg","slug":"danny-devitos-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508966977925","title":"The Tomatometer Guide to Disneyland","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Tomatometer Guide to Disneyland22 Disneyland attractions and their movie counterparts.by Jeff Giles | May 20, 2015 |  CommentsTomorrowland is the first film to be named after a section of Disneyland, but it’s far from the only movie that’s drawn inspiration from the Happiest Place on Earth — or vice versa — and to demonstrate the park’s strong silver screen ties (not to mention honoring Tomorrowland‘s arrival in theaters this weekend), we decided to dedicate this week’s list to all the Disneyland rides that have some sort of connection to a Disney film. There might be more than you think!ADVENTURELAND&nbsp;Indiana Jones Adventure – Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)  95%Long before Disney and Lucasfilm were wed in Hollywood matrimony, George Lucas teamed up with Disney’s legions of Imagineers to put together the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! in Orlando — and when that proved a raging success, the two entertainment titans reunited for Disneyland’s Indiana Jones Adventure. An ambitious “enhanced motion vehicle dark ride,” this attraction sends visitors on a thrilling quest with everyone’s favorite archaeologist, and even tosses in voice tracks from Harrison Ford himself.Tarzan’s Treehouse – Tarzan (1999)  89%Once upon a time, Disneyland’s Adventureland area included a giant artificial tree attraction that stood in tribute to Disney’s 1960 live-action adventure Swiss Family Robinson. Progress marches on, however, and in 1999, the Swiss Family Treehouse was shut down and reborn anew as Tarzan’s Treehouse — a refurbished and “re-themed” destination timed to tie in with the studio’s new animated effort starring the King of the Jungle.&nbsp;CRITTER COUNTRY&nbsp;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh – The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)  100%Countless Disney fans enjoyed their first exposure to Winnie the Pooh through the studio’s 1977 animated adaptation of A.A. Milne’s classic books, so it’s hard to believe that until 2003, Pooh and his pals didn’t have their own ride at Disneyland — or that when one was finally built, it was constructed on the grave of the late, lamented Country Bear Jamboree.Splash Mountain – Song of the South (1946)  50%In quite a few respects, the 1946 live-action/animated Song of the South is Disney’s Film That Dare Not Speak Its Name — the antiquated racial attitudes on display in the studio’s adaptation of the Uncle Remus stories have long prevented the film from receiving any kind of complete home video release. That hasn’t kept the mischievous Br’er Rabbit and his friends out of Disneyland, however; in fact, their stories were woven into the popular flume ride Splash Mountain — which, perhaps fittingly, went on to attract its own controversy.&nbsp;FANTASYLAND&nbsp;Alice in Wonderland – Alice in Wonderland (1951)  81%Not only does this attraction mirror Alice’s tumble down the rabbit hole into Wonderland, it utilizes voices, music, and (after a 2014 refurbishment) footage from the original film, making it one of the more sensible screen-to-ride tie-ins — and one that, like the film, is best enjoyed by the very young at heart.Casey Jr. Circus Train – Dumbo (1941)  98%There are only a handful of ways in which Disneyland’s ride designers could have fashioned a family attraction out of a film in which an elephant is born into servitude, separated from his mother, gets drunk, and is forced to jump off a platform to his possible death. Building a gentle, junior-level ride that kind of looks like the train where the elephant was born was probably one of the better choices.Dumbo the Flying Elephant – Dumbo (1941)  98%Poor little Dumbo went through some stuff during the movie that bears his name, but he was never happier than when he was flying, so it only stands to reason that the Happiest Place on Earth should give him a kid-friendly attraction that sends riders swooping gently through the sky.King Arthur Carrousel – The Sword in the Stone (1963)  66%After a certain age, many amusement park visitors tend to sort of forget the carousel is even there, but the King Arthur Carrousel is special, and not just because of that extra R: Present on Disneyland’s opening day, this beauty was actually built in 1875 and was transported to Anaheim from a park in Ontario, where it had been in operation since 1922. The Sword in the Stone Ceremony held nearby — in which a dude dressed up as Merlin teases people who can’t tug a rigged sword out of its perch — is marginally more exciting, but the Carrousel’s history makes it one of the cooler attractions in the park.&nbsp;FANTASYLAND (CONT’D)&nbsp;Mad Tea Party – Alice in Wonderland (1951)  81%One of a handful of Disneyland rides whose mere mention is liable to turn those with motion sickness green, the Mad Tea Party puts visitors in giant tea cups and spins ’em ’round — and although today it’s one of the more eminently kid-friendly stops in the park, the cups were initially built with no brakes. The Mad Hatter would no doubt frown upon the subsequent safety modifications.Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride – The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949)  94%One of a small handful of Disneyland attractions that remain from the park’s opening day in 1955, Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride offers a relatively kid-friendly tie-in to the Wind in the Willows portion of 1949’s The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad — and if you’ve never seen that animated short, you can consider yourself one of the reasons why Disney is actively developing a movie that will tie into the ride that tied into the original film.Pinocchio’s Daring Journey – Pinocchio (1940)  100%One of those rides that essentially acts as a Cliff’s Notes version of the movie that inspired it, Pinocchio’s Daring Journey came to Disneyland as part of the park’s early ’80s overhaul within Fantasyland, and uses an assortment of effects (including one of Disneyland’s first uses of holographic material) to help riders relive Pinocchio’s bumpy travels from puppet to real boy.Pixie Hollow – Tinker Bell (2008)  90%Disneyland’s place to be for the visitor who just can’t get enough of Peter Pan’s pint-sized pal, Pixie Hollow affords the young at heart an opportunity to meet Tinker Bell and her pals in person. Of course, it also keeps ’em coming back for further installments of the steadily expanding Disney Fairies empire of films, books, and toys, but that’s the way these things work — and anything that gives more work to Mae Whitman, who voices Tink in the movies, is all right by us.Sleeping Beauty’s Castle – Sleeping Beauty (1959)  89%The word “iconic” is definitely overused to the point of abuse, but it absolutely applies to Sleeping Beauty’s Castle, which has loomed over Disneyland since it opened to the public. But this structure does more than just welcome visitors with a physical recreation of the Disney logo — it also contains a walkthrough attraction that guides visitors through the story of Sleeping Beauty. The castle received a handful of special renovations during the park’s 50th anniversary celebration in 2005-’06, including some relatively subtle additions on five of the turrets.Snow White’s Scary Adventures – Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)  98%Everyone always remembers Prince Charming and those happy singing dwarves, but Snow White gets herself into some pretty creepy stuff before strolling off into the sunset with Mr. Happily Ever After, and that’s the focus of this decidedly old-school attraction, which has been gently terrorizing children of all ages since Disneyland opened its gates. With a few minor modifications, that is — including the wicked witch’s poison apple, which was turned into a hologram after park officials got tired of guests stealing the prop.Peter Pan’s Flight – Peter Pan (1953)  78%Currently closed for its second round of refurbishments, this Peter Pan tie-in has been in operation as long as the park has been open — and its gently soaring tour through Neverland and the night skies of London offers a sweet tie to the gentler brand of family thrills that Disneyland used to almost exclusively offer. When it reopens this summer, visitors can expect enhanced special effects, but will likely find substantially the same old-school attraction.&nbsp;MICKEY’S TOONTOWN&nbsp;Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon Spin – Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)  97%Who Framed Roger Rabbit fans may never get the sequel they’ve been asking about for decades, but in the meantime, they can pretend to be part of the action by hopping on Disneyland’s Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon Spin, a dark ride adventure that incorporates voice work from members of the movie’s cast.&nbsp;NEW ORLEANS SQUARE&nbsp;The Haunted Mansion – The Haunted Mansion (2003)  14%Very often, the movie comes before the ride; in this case, Disney attempted to turn a venerable Disneyland attraction into a film — and even though the ride in question was the fan favorite Haunted Mansion, which arguably should have been rather easy to make a movie out of (it’s a haunted house, people are in it, etc.), the results were sadly disastrous. Our hopes are quite a bit higher for the upcoming Guillermo del Toro-crafted Haunted Mansion movie, but even if that one stinks too, it still won’t put a damper on the pulse-quickening fun of one of the park’s greatest attractions.Pirates of the Caribbean – Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)  79%The final Disneyland attraction to enjoy the benefit of Walt Disney’s oversight before his passing in 1967, Pirates of the Caribbean spent decades as one of the brighter jewels in the park’s animatronic crown before studio execs decided to try and turn it into a movie. Despite the fact that audiences weren’t exactly clamoring for pirate pictures in 2003, the Johnny Depp-led Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl turned out to be a blockbuster — and the first installment in an ongoing franchise that’s reaped billions (and counting).&nbsp;RIVERS OF AMERICA&nbsp;Fantasmic! – Fantasia (1940)  95%One of the looser screen-to-attraction tie-ins on our list, Fantasmic! has the dubious distinction of making its Disneyland debut during the Rodney King riots in the spring of 1992 — complete with (quickly pulled) promotional materials urging visitors to “be here when the night ignites.” All that aside, it does have at least a little in common with Fantasia: Like the film, it’s a thrilling visual display set to music.&nbsp;TOMORROWLAND&nbsp;Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters – Toy Story (1995)  100%Buzz Lightyear’s Toy Story adventures all take place right here on Earth, but Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters (or BLAB) sends visitors soaring into space on an urgent mission to defeat Buzz’s nemesis, the nefarious Emperor Zurg. And unlike old-school rides that attempt to immerse you in the action with sets and animatronic figures, this Tomorrowland attraction works as a sort of live-action video game: Riders control their “spaceship” with a joystick and shoot the bad guys with laser pistols (and once even allowed internet-powered at-home play).Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage – Finding Nemo (2003)  99%It was a sad day for scores of Disneyland fans when Tomorrowland’s venerable Submarine Voyage ride shut down for good in 1998, but after nearly a decade in storage — and tons of money spent on overhauling the attraction — it was brought back to life in 2007 as the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, a shiny new underwater adventure that relies on modern projection technology (and renovated coral in the lagoon) to transport visitors into the classic Pixar hit.Star Tours – The Adventures Continue – Star Wars (1977)  92%Like a certain filmmaker going back to edit certain classic films, Disneyland shuttered its popular Star Tours attraction in order to make way for the overhauled Star Tours – The Adventures Continue. Fortunately in this case, people were generally happy with the new ride, which relies on classic elements (including voicework from members of the Star Wars cast as well as the continued presence of C-3PO as a guide) to deliver a new dose of thrills and spills from a galaxy far, far away.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"ABC, Month, Sematary, romantic, 2015, Trailer, Marvel, lord, Television","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/guide-to-disneyland.jpg","slug":"the-tomatometer-guide-to-disneyland"},{"id":"47508966953347","title":"10 Essential Movies About Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Essential Movies About MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look at some of the best films about \"the industry.\"by Jeff Giles | June 3, 2015 |  CommentsThe Entourage gang returns this weekend in the long-awaited big-screen adaptation of their long-running HBO hit series, and in honor of seeing Vince and his buddies again, we’ve decided to dedicate our latest feature to movies about making movies — a grand Hollywood tradition that, as you’ll see here, includes some Certified Fresh classics. Lights, camera, Total Recall!Bowfinger (1999)  81%If it had come together a decade sooner, 1999’s Eddie Murphy/Steve Martin summit Bowfinger might have been a collaboration of epic proportions; as it was, neither Martin nor Murphy were exactly flush with cinematic goodwill in ’99, with memories of would-be comedies like Sgt. Bilko and Holy Man still fresh in filmgoers’ minds. Which is sort of a shame, because the Martin-penned Bowfinger ended up being one of the sharper and more entertaining Hollywood satires to reach theaters in years, sending up the town, the studio system, and — though Martin has denied it — the church of Scientology. Acting in dual roles as the world-famous, insanely paranoid Kit Ramsey and his milquetoast, talent-deficient twin brother Jiff, Murphy was able to poke fun at his own insulated image, while Martin — who wrote the script — has a gift for vacillating between sincerity and smarm that made him a natural for the part of would-be filmmaker Bobby Bowfinger. As Bob Graham argued for the San Francisco Chronicle, “Martin the writer plants some wicked barbs in Hollywood’s rear end about creative financing of movies and hoarding of profits, the art of the deal, hipper-than-thou attitudes and exploitation.”Watch TrailerClouds of Sils Maria (2015)  90%The unreasonable premium Hollywood places on youth tends to weigh most heavily on the film industry’s female stars, who find opportunities for substantial roles drying up as they age out of that prized 18-34 target demographic. That brutal culling process is the backdrop for Olivier Assayas’ Clouds of Sils Maria, which peeks in on an esteemed actress (Juliette Binoche) who’s presented the opportunity to star as the older woman in a stage revival of the play that made her career — 20 years earlier, when she played the younger woman in the show. Kristen Stewart, playing Binoche’s assistant and rehearsal partner, nails a role that allows Assayas to tease out some of the story’s thornier themes, while Chloë Grace Moretz, as the young actress in line to play the part that made Binoche’s character famous, serves as a subtly scathing commentary on modern celebrity culture. “Clouds of Sils Maria is fiendishly wise to the ways of show business, particularly the boxes in which it places women,” nodded Chris Vognar for the Dallas Morning News. “But the film offers more than that.”Watch Trailer8 1/2 (1963)  98%A master filmmaker’s film about a master filmmaker making a film: There are certainly more descriptive ways of summing up Federico Fellini’s 8 1/2, but that’s the plot of this 1963 classic in the most succinct possible terms. Starring Marcello Mastrioanni as the famed Italian director Guido Anselmi, whose attempts to recuperate after a particularly draining project are foiled by a parade of hangers-on angling for a piece of his next film, it works as both a delightfully meta commentary on the movie industry and as a playfully inventive, often uproarious comedy. “8 1/2,” decreed Roger Ebert, “is the best film ever made about filmmaking.”Watch TrailerGet Shorty (1995)  88%Is the movie industry enough of a racket that a mobster could use his unique job skills to make a lateral transition into filmmaking? Maybe, maybe not, but in Barry Sonnenfeld’s Get Shorty — adapted from Elmore Leonard’s bestselling novel of the same name — that’s exactly what happens, with hilarious (if generally somewhat implausible) results. Of course, it helps that Sonnenfeld had an impeccable ensemble to work with, most of whom had been around the block enough times to earn the right to have some fun at Hollywood’s expense — and when your leads include John Travolta as a loan shark with a heart of gold, Rene Russo and Danny DeVito as divorced stars, and Gene Hackman as a beleaguered director with a bad habit of borrowing large sums of money, you really can’t go too far wrong. “Hollywood has been in love with mobsters since the beginning of movies,” observed Newsweek’s David Ansen. “But the other side of the equation has seldom been considered. That is, until now.”Watch TrailerMulholland Drive (2001)  83%It resists synopsis and analysis in characteristically Lynchian fashion, but whatever it may or may not actually be about, Mulholland Drive opens a dark window into the twilight fringes of Hollywood inhabited by an aspiring actress (Naomi Watts) who arrives in Los Angeles and discovers an amnesiac woman (Laura Harring) living in her aunt’s apartment. As for the film itself, well, critics have been puzzling over its surreal imagery, nonlinear plot, and jumbled narrative since Mulholland arrived in theaters — but whether or not you can figure out what it all means, argued the New York Observer’s Andrew Sarris, it’s “one of the very few movies in which the pieces not only add up to much more than the whole, but also supersede it with a series of (for the most part) fascinating fragments.”Watch TrailerThe Muppet Movie (1979)  88%The Muppets made their first journey to the big screen in style, telling their origin story (or, in Kermit’s words, “sort of approximately how it happened”) with a movie about a gentle frog with big dreams, journeying to Hollywood to take his shot at making it big with his fuzzy felt pals, a classic Paul Williams soundtrack, and an all-star cast that made room for current stars while paying tribute to silver screen tradition with appearances from Charles Durning, Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, Bob Hope, Milton Berle, ’70s movie mainstay Dom DeLuise, and Orson Welles. That’s a lot of star wattage for a movie unquestionably toplined by puppets, but The Muppet Movie wasn’t kid stuff; it presented a family-friendly blend of sweet-natured drama and sharp, often surprisingly sophisticated humor. Observed Jeffrey M. Anderson for Combustible Celluloid, “Not only was The Muppet Movie a great children’s movie in 1979, one that viewers of all ages could enjoy, but it’s still a great children’s movie today.”Watch TrailerThe Player (1992)  98%The ’80s found director Robert Altman in a bit of a professional lull, forced to venture outside the major studio system after suffering a string of commercial setbacks. But whatever dignities he had to endure during those years were worth it if they helped lead to The Player, a cheerfully black satire of the film industry in which a sleazy studio exec (Tim Robbins) commits a series of desperate and immoral acts to hang onto his position while being threatened by an anonymous stalker and fending off a professional rival. Adapted by Michael Tolkin from his own novel, The Player captures Altman at his best, wrangling a large ensemble cast while bringing technical sophistication and a light touch to the story’s cynical point of view. As Hal Hinson wrote for the Washington Post, “Altman loves practical jokes, and The Player is his craftiest prank, his jolly last laugh.”Watch TrailerSingin’ in the Rain (1952)  100%The end of the silent film era and the advent of the “talkies” gave rise to a new breed of Hollywood star while adversely affecting the careers of others — including Norma Talmadge, whose embarrassing fall from grace loosely inspired the musical comedy classic Singin’ in the Rain. Starring Gene Kelly as silent film star Don Lockwood and Jean Hagen as the leading lady he can’t stand, Singin’ plays the duo’s career crossroads for laughs, forcing Hagen’s character to submit to the indignity of overdubs recorded by the ingenue (Debbie Reynolds) Lockwood is falling for — and she can’t stand. “If you’ve never seen it and don’t,” argued Time Out’s Stephen Garrett, “you’re bonkers.”Watch TrailerState and Main (2000)  85%It’s easy to forget just how much effort goes into making even the worst movie, and how many people have to come together to make that happen — a huge collaborative pooling of resources and moving parts whose greatest successes often occur against seemingly insurmountable odds. Of course, it’s possible to find humor even in the failure of such a noble endeavor, as evidenced by David Mamet’s biting Hollywood satire State and Main. Starring William H. Macy as the increasingly put-upon director of a film that’s forced to change locations after its leading man (Alec Baldwin) gets himself in hot water for fooling around with an underage girl (Julia Stiles), it’s very much a comedy of errors — but one enlivened by Mamet’s gift for knotty plots and brilliant dialogue, as well as the efforts of a marvelous ensemble cast that also included Philip Seymour Hoffman, Charles Durning, and Sarah Jessica Parker. “State and Main might be the perfect David Mamet movie for people who don’t like David Mamet movies,” suggested Eric Harrison for the Houston Chronicle. “The nice thing about it, though, is that it won’t disappoint the rest of us.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Sunset Boulevard (1950)  99%Fame is a fickle mistress, and after she’s gone, adjusting to life out of the limelight can be unbearably difficult. It’s a sad reality we’ve seen depicted in countless films, but none as brilliantly as Sunset Boulevard, starring Gloria Swanson as faded star Norma Desmond and William Holden as the struggling screenwriter who unwittingly enters her delusional orbit. Swanson, herself a former silent film star who’d seen her own stock fall, brought incredible depth to a role that loosely mirrored the careers of many women discarded by the movie industry, while director Billy Wilder delivered some of his best work in service of a film that remains one of the greatest Hollywood tragedies ever made. “Dark comedy. Film noir. Tragic romance. Hollywood satire,” wrote John J. Puccio for Movie Metropolis. “Sunset Boulevard has it all.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"WGN, parents, TV, Bravo, adventure, Election, York, Brie, Binge","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/singin-in-the-rain.jpg","slug":"10-essential-movies-about-movies"},{"id":"47508971554226","title":"Emma Stone’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Emma Stone's 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we count down the best-reviewed work of the Amazing Spider-Man 2 star.by Jeff Giles | May 1, 2014 |  CommentsShe’s only a few years past legal drinking age, but Emma Stone has already been wooed by Jonah Hill, voiced a homo erectus teen, and battled zombies — and this weekend, she’ll make her second appearance as Gwen Stacy in Marc Webb’s rebooted Amazing Spider-Man saga, so now seems like a pretty good time to take a look back at some of the brighter critical highlights from her growing list of film credits. We’re romancing the Stone, Total Recall style!Matt Atchity breaks down this week’s list. 31%10. Gangster SquadIt wasn’t supposed to be this way for Gangster Squad. With a fact-based screenplay inspired by the LAPD’s efforts to take down notorious scofflaw Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) and a terrific cast bolstered by the presence of some of Hollywood’s hottest young actors (including Stone, Ryan Gosling, and Anthony Mackie) as well as a handful of savvy vets such as Nick Nolte and Josh Brolin, this should have been a crime thriller for the ages; alas, the movie’s fate seemed doomed from the start. A public shooting whose details bore an unfortunate similarity to an event in the plot prompted a four-month delay that ended up exiling the movie to the January graveyard — which was just as well for critics, the majority of whom found it to be underwritten and excessively violent. Still, if you’re looking for a gangster flick with old-fashioned morals, you could do worse; as Dave White wrote for Movies.com, “Here, the good guys win, the bad guys earn their comeuppance, the dames look pretty and the dopey dialogue shoves a grapefruit in your face and shuts you up.” 43%9. The House BunnyIt sounds like the kind of movie that should star a Wayans brother in drag: The House Bunny follows the bubbly adventures of an exiled Plaboy Playmate (Anna Faris) who latches onto a gaggle of unpopular sorority sisters and ends up learning a lot — as well as teaching her new friends a few things — about life, love, and self-respect. With a plot that mashes up a gender-reversed Revenge of the Nerds against any coming-of-age comedy you could mention, it’s no surprise that The House Bunny failed to woo many critics, but largely thanks to its immensely appealing cast, the movie has become something of a cult favorite over the last few years; as far as Salon’s Stephanie Zacharek was concerned, it “gets the difference between being openhearted and empty-headed.” 41%8. The RockerGiven how adroitly Rainn Wilson embodied the spirit of incompetence-fueled arrogance during his run as Dwight Schrute on NBC’s The Office, asking him to play a freakishly intense man-child in The Rocker must have seemed like a great idea on paper. And actually, Wilson’s performance is the least of this 2008 comedy’s problems — he, like the rest of the cast (including Stone as a member of the teen band Wilson’s character ends up drumming for after he’s fired, Dewey Finn style, from the group he founded), does exactly what he’s asked to do. Unfortunately, no one’s asked to do enough to differentiate The Rocker from similar (and funnier) comedies; as Elliott Noble pointed out in his lukewarm review for Sky Movies, “Essentially covering the same playlist as Jack Black’s School of Rock, The Rocker is a good-natured, live-the-dream lark in which the one-liners score hits but the slapstick continually misses.” 72%7. The CroodsGiven Nicolas Cage’s track record, you could tell someone he and Emma Stone co-starred in a movie in which they played characters named Grug and Eep and had to contend with prehistoric creatures, and it would be perfectly logical to ask whether the film in question was an intentional comedy. Happily, The Croods boasts plenty of genuine laughs to go along with its colorful animation, thanks to a sweet story about a caveman patriarch (Cage) whose willful daughter (Stone) spurs an adventure into the outside world. A massive worldwide hit and eventual launchpad for a new DreamWorks Animation franchise, it is also, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune’s Colin Covert, “the kind of rib-tickling, emotionally satisfying, universally appealing effort that gives computer animation a good name.” 72%6. The Amazing Spider-ManOutside the Sony Pictures offices, very few people truly believed the Spider-Man franchise really needed a reboot in 2012, but we got one anyway. Fortunately, even if it couldn’t escape the familiar confines of a character mythology that had only recently been explored in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy, Marc Webb’s The Amazing Spider-Man had a few things going for it — including an impressive cast that boasted Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Rhys Ifans, and as Peter Parker’s (Andrew Garfield) doomed young love interest Gwen Stacy, Emma Stone. Without such dependable stars, it’s questionable whether audiences would have been quite as willing to shell out for another return to Spider-Man’s roots; as it was, the Atlantic’s Christopher Orr spoke for many of his peers when he wrote, “The Amazing Spider-Man is considerably more fun — and, yes, even touching — than so premature a reboot had any right to be.” 76%5. The HelpAdapted by writer-director Tate Taylor from Kathryn Stockett’s bestseller, The Help looks at ’60s Southern racism through the eyes of young journalist Skeeter Phelan (Stone), whose youthful idealism spurs her to mount a writing project that gives local maids an opportunity to expose their systematic mistreatment at the hands of the upper class — and which ultimately wreaks all manner of havoc in the relationships in and around Skeeter’s own family. A $211 million global smash, The Help picked up four Academy Award nominations, including a Best Supporting Actress win for Octavia Spencer, and enjoyed a largely positive critical response. “The movie isn’t perfect,” admitted Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman, “it sometimes shows its stitching. But mostly it’s a stirring salute to subjugated women who hold their heads high.” 79%4. Crazy, Stupid, Love.A year after breaking out in the high school comedy Easy A, Stone graduated to more adult rom-com fare with Crazy, Stupid, Love. Playing the slightly neurotic target of a Lothario (Ryan Gosling) whose suave exterior masks unsuspected sensitivity, Stone added a layer of adorable sweetness to the dark drama in the movie’s other storyline, which follows a middle-aged bachelor (Steve Carell) on his adventures through his unwilling re-entry to the dating pool after discovering that his wife (Julianne Moore) wants a divorce. Neither of its plot strands are particularly original, but the cast is charming, and as Bob Mondello joked for NPR, “In a genre where outright imbecility generally prevails, a film investigating craziness and stupidity qualifies as a cut above.” 85%3. Easy ABy the time Easy A came out in 2010, Emma Stone was a few weeks away from turning 22, and as a genre, the teen comedies that inspired director Will Gluck seemed just as dated as his star. But as it turned out, Stone could still play a fairly convincing high school student, and Gluck’s gleefully referential script — which openly paid homage to Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, among other John Hughes classics — helped breathe new life into a story that re-imagined Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter one more time. Starring Stone as teen misfit Olive Penderghast, Easy transplants the source material’s tale of misguided morality to a modern high school ruled by a popular prude (Amanda Bynes) whose vengeful gossip inspires Olive to take rumors into her own hands. Effectively serving as Stone’s leading-lady coming-out party, Easy A scored with audiences as well as critics like ReelViews’ James Berardinelli, who decreed that it “belongs in the company of Election, Heathers, and Mean Girls — all motion pictures that have outlived their theatrical lives because they have unique voices and use them to say something.” 88%2. SuperbadWatching Superbad, you can kind of tell that co-writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg wrote their first draft of the screenplay when they were 15 — and that’s a good thing. Relying more heavily on sharp R-rated humor than gratuitous T&amp;A, the movie follows the increasingly desperate efforts of graduating pals Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) to score at a party being thrown by the popular girl (Emma Stone) that Seth secretly pines for; of course, this being a teen comedy, just getting to the party turns into a horrific (and hellaciously funny) ordeal that includes a pair of incompetent cops (played by Rogen and Bill Hader) and the most memorably incompetent fake ID in recent cinematic history (sported by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who will forever hear cries of “McLovin!” whenever he steps out in public). “Even if Superbad‘s not much more than a teen comedy, it’s the best teen comedy to come out in at least a decade,” argued Paste Magazine’s Sean Gandert. “There’s no shame in that.” 89%1. ZombielandWith the number of zombie movies that have been released, any new entry in the genre really has to do something different in order to stand out — and that’s just what Ruben Fleischer did with Zombieland, starring Woody Harrelson as a cynical survivalist prowling post-outbreak America in search of a Twinkie, Jesse Eisenberg as a college student whose meek exterior masks a surprisingly effective zombie killer, and Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as a pair of sisters who join them on their journey to a California amusement park that’s rumored to be zombie-free. Toss in one of the most excellent celebrity cameos in recent memory, and it all added up to a $100 million hit — and the movie Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel described as “the funniest zombie movie since Shawn of the Dead, funnier even than Fido” as well as “a 28 Days Later played for laughs — lots of them, endless jokes, one-liners and sight gags.”In case you were wondering, here are Stone’s top 10 movies according&nbsp;to RT users’ scores:1.

Tolkien adaptations by Tomatometer.by Jeff Giles | December 17, 2014 |  CommentsAfter billions in sales, hours of adventures, and more than a decade of work, Peter Jackson’s double-trilogy adaptation of author J.R.R. Tolkien’s classic Lord of the Rings and Hobbit books is finally concluded, and now that critics have weighed in on all six films, it’s time to look back and see how The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies stacks up against its predecessors. With that in mind, we present an updated list of Jackson’s Middle-earth saga that includes his most recent epic, fresh off of a $90 million debut in the US. What did you think of The Battle of the Five Armies, and how do you feel about its place on the list?6. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014) &nbsp; 59%When the Lord of the Rings trilogy reached its conclusion with The Return of the King in 2003, it strode into theaters like a conqueror, the culmination of a critically beloved and commercially spectacular franchise whose satisfying denouement seemed like a foregone conclusion. Peter Jackson’s Hobbit movies were never quite so fortunate; while they were reviewed well enough and certainly made a fair bit of money at the box office, this prequel trilogy never built up as much steam as its predecessor — so it’s perhaps fitting that the final installment, 2014’s The Battle of the Five Armies, ended its journey in Fresh territory by a fairly slim margin. While most critics enjoyed Armies, they also felt that it — like the trilogy as a whole — suffered from overextension, the result of stretching a relatively brief book out to three epic films. (Armies, at nearly two and a half hours, is the shortest of a very hefty bunch.) Still, no matter how long it takes to arrive, a satisfying ending is a satisfying ending; as Claudia Puig wrote for USA Today, “The final installment of the Hobbit trilogy is the best, featuring more spectacular action scenes as well as the series’ most emotionally resonant moments.”5. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) &nbsp; 64%Just when he thought he was out, they pulled him back in. Jackson wasn’t supposed to direct The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey — originally, he only signed on to produce a two-part series of Hobbit movies, with Guillermo del Toro attached to direct. But after two years of slogging away on a first installment that seemed like it might never get off the ground thanks to money woes at MGM, del Toro departed, leaving Jackson to take the reins. And while Unexpected Journey failed to live up to its own hype in some ways — critics seemed a lot more sensitive to this chapter’s inflated running time, and some scribes were displeased with Jackson’s decision to film at 48 frames per second — that didn’t stop it from grossing over a billion dollars worldwide, or from reaping positive reviews from the likes of the Newark Star-Ledger’s Stephen Whitty, who wrote approvingly, “The Hobbit becomes what it was originally meant to be — not a cut-from-the-same-cloth prequel, but its own, individual thing.”4. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013) &nbsp; 74%With 2012’s The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Jackson found himself in a situation few filmmakers ever experience — namely, following up a movie that made more than a billion dollars worldwide but was still regarded as something of a disappointment. It couldn’t have come as a surprise to Jackson, given the marginally more contemplative pace of his first Lord of the Rings prequel, as well as the crushing weight of expectations generated by the epic blockbusting sweep of Jackson’s LotR trilogy. His Hobbit franchise rebounded with its second installment, 2013’s The Desolation of Smaug, which fell a hair short of its predecessor’s impressive box office take, yet enjoyed a far warmer critical reception — due in no small part to the introduction of Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice and mo-cap spirit of the titular dragon, adding action and evil charisma to a series that needed both. As Betsy Sharkey put it in her review for the Los Angeles Times, “Peter Jackson’s newest installment of the Tolkien trilogy is set afire by the scorching roar of a dragon.”3. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) &nbsp; 91%It took a few decades to get there, but once J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings books finally, officially made their way to theaters, they did it in a big way — and they did it the right way, courtesy of Peter Jackson’s sure-handed direction (and a $93 million budget), not to mention a pitch-perfect cast that included Elijah Wood (as the pure-hearted hobbit Frodo), Sean Astin (as his stalwart friend Samwise), and Ian McKellen (as the mighty wizard Gandalf), united in their quest to save Middle-earth from the malignant advances of the dark lord Sauron. Full of eye-popping special effects (including those used to bring to life the warped Gollum, played by Andy Serkis) and bolstered by a screenplay that did justice to its hefty source material, it was an unqualified smash — both with audiences and with critics like the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick LaSalle, who observed, “Watching it, one can’t help but get the impression that everyone involved was steeped in Tolkien’s work, loved the book, treasured it and took care not to break a cherished thing in it.”2. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) &nbsp; 93%After all that buildup, the final installment of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy had a lot of epic expectations to live up to — and by most accounts, 2003’s The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King met or exceeded them, delivering the franchise’s passionate fanbase a suitably sweeping conclusion to the saga that many of them had loved since long before Jackson ever stepped behind a camera. Clearly, given all the anticipation that later greeted The Hobbit, Jackson was the right person to adapt the beloved books that served as his movies’ source material; as Bill Muller put it for the Arizona Republic, “Not only has Jackson boldly and faithfully brought J.R.R. Tolkien’s world to life, he’s created the most epic and sweeping fantasy adventure of all time.”1. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) &nbsp; 95%He set a high bar for himself with the first Lord of the Rings movie, The Fellowship of the Ring — and then Jackson surpassed it with the second installment, 2002’s The Two Towers, which took a plotline that largely amounted to a lot of walking and turned it into a legitimate three-hour epic, complete with elves, dwarves, hobbits, amazing large-scale battles, and sentient, ambulatory trees. A two-time Academy Award winner (and Best Picture nominee), The Two Towers racked up nearly a billion dollars worldwide during its theatrical run, and prompted suitably hefty praise from critics like Salon’s Charles Taylor, who opined, “Yes, there are some ‘middle-chapter’ problems, but Peter Jackson’s Tolkien adaptation hasn’t lost its devastating humanity, its heart-stopping cinematography or its epic sweep.”Finally, here’s Orlando Bloom having a bit of fun on set and singing an internet-famous ditty:Read more Total Recall","section":"Total Recall","tags":"prank, adaptation, caribbean, Emmy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tolkiens-Middle-earth-Movies.jpg","slug":"total-recall-peter-jacksons-middle-earth-movies"},{"id":"47508968825238","title":"Joaquin Phoenix’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Joaquin Phoenix's 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we count down the best-reviewed work of the Inherent Vice star.by Jeff Giles | January 8, 2015 |  CommentsIt’s hard enough making a longterm career out of a few roles as a child actor. But going Hollywood as an adult when your big brother is already famous? Forget about it — unless you’re Joaquin Phoenix, that is. Formerly a screen tyke following in the footsteps of his sibling River Phoenix, young Joaquin has grown into one of the more entertainingly inscrutable leading men in the movie business, and the owner of a filmography that includes everything from mainstream fare like 8mm and Brother Bear to arthouse favorites like The Master. This weekend, Phoenix goes wide with Inherent Vice, and we decided to celebrate by turning our attention to some of his brightest critical highlights. It’s time for Total Recall!10. Signs (2002)  74%M. Night Shyamalan was on a roll after The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, and the third entry in his blockbuster twist-ending trilogy — 2002’s Signs — was one of the more highly anticipated films of the year. While it didn’t quite live up to the expectations generated by its predecessors, this supernatural thriller about aliens touching down and wreaking havoc in a small Pennsylvania town continued the writer-director’s run of critical goodwill and box office gold, thanks in part to a marquee-blazing cast that included Mel Gibson as the priest-farmer whose crops are disturbed by extraterrestrial forces and Joaquin Phoenix as his brother. As far as Shyamalan’s star has fallen in recent years, Signs also stands as proof of his ability to ratchet up suspense; as Susan Stark argued for the Detroit News, it’s “a complex story told with assurance and performed with quiet conviction” that “smoothly and stylishly blends scares and substance.”Watch Trailer9. Quills (2000)  75%It would be hard to put together a worthwhile biopic about the Marquis de Sade without indulging in a certain amount of lurid cinema, and 2000’s Quills — starring Geoffrey Rush in a tour de force performance as the institutionalized author — definitely makes room for matters of the (supple) flesh. But director Philip Kaufman, working from a script by Doug Wright (adapted from Wright’s Obie-winning play), had more on his mind than titillation; in fact, the movie’s really more of a statement about how society deals with sexuality and mental illness. Of course, it helps that he had a fine cast to work with; aside from Rush, who netted an Oscar nomination, Quills boasts the talents of Kate Winslet, Michael Caine, and Joaquin Phoenix, whose turn as the Marquis’ asylum warden, Abbé du Coulmier, adds a particularly tortured note of repression to the proceedings. “It breathes, it twirls, it prances right up into your face,” wrote Eric Harrison for the Houston Chronicle. “It swirls over the top sometimes, but there never is any doubt you’re watching a movie about something.”Watch Trailer8. Gladiator (2000)  77%Putting together a solidly entertaining swords ‘n’ sandals epic is easier said than done, even in today’s era of impressive CG effects, so when Ridley Scott announced his plans to film a sweeping Roman Empire drama, some skepticism may have been warranted. The results, however, sharply reflected Scott’s ambition, and were solidly entertaining to boot: Gladiator, starring Russell Crowe as a noble Roman general and Phoenix as the scurrilous young emperor who tries — and fails — to end him, walked away with more than $450 million in grosses and no fewer than five Oscars (including Best Picture). “Gladiator, well cast and impressively staged, is every inch the summer blockbuster it intends to be,” wrote Gary Thompson for the Philadelphia Daily News. “It’s also something more. Amid the action and intrigue, director Scott makes a few points about blockbuster-style entertainment.”Watch Trailer7. Two Lovers (2008)  82%Released amidst the hubbub of Phoenix’s supposed retirement from acting, Two Lovers stood up to the hype, planting its leading man in the midst of a rather melodramatic tale about a quasi-suicidal layabout who finds himself vacillating between an arranged relationship with the daughter (Vinessa Shaw) of a business associate of his parents and an obviously ill-advised affair with a local drug addict (Gwyneth Paltrow) who’s carrying on with a married man (Elias Koteas). There’s smooching, pensive looks, and a half-hearted suicide attempt — what more could a love story ask for? Not a heck of a lot according to Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times, who mused, “Themes of loneliness, alienation and unrequited love are not new, but there is always that sense of the unexpected in Phoenix that keeps you curious.”Watch Trailer6. Walk the Line (2005)  82%Nothing rouses Academy voters quite like a well-made musical biopic — or at least it seemed that way in 2005, when director James Mangold’s Walk the Line, inspired by the early career of country legend Johnny Cash and his love affair with June Carter, netted five Oscar nominations, including Best Actor for Phoenix (who played Cash) and Best Actress for Reese Witherspoon (who portrayed Carter, and won). Coming the year after Jamie Foxx won for his work in the title role of Ray, Taylor Hackford’s Ray Charles biopic, Walk the Line might have seemed like part of a formula, but it’s really its own picture — and one that featured a stack of compelling musical performances from its stars, who flashed plenty of chutzpah by trying to fill some awfully big boots. “Walk the Line is less music history than love story,” argued Moira MacDonald for the Seattle Times, concluding that the picture’s success “comes down to the performances of the two people at its center, both of which are splendid.”Watch Trailer5. The Master (2012)  84%Strikingly filmed, powerfully acted, and occasionally more than a little inscrutable, The Master arrived in theaters as one of cineastes’ more highly anticipated films of 2012; after all, even if the end result had been a dud, the mere prospect of a post-There Will Be Blood Paul Thomas Anderson working with Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams on a sweeping period piece drama infused with alleged Scientology overtones promised cinema worth seeing. And in the end, The Master lived up or down to pretty much everything Anderson’s acolytes and detractors could have anticipated — a film that, in telling a story on its own terms and leaving it up to the viewer to interpret its aims, acts as a mirror for its beholder’s expectations. Calling it “Entrancing from first frame to last,” Chris Vognar of the Dallas Morning News mused, “The lights go down, they come up 137 minutes later, and you’re left to ask yourself: What on earth did I just see?”Watch Trailer4. The Immigrant (2014)  85%A lavishly mounted period piece from director James Gray, 2014’s The Immigrant presents a horror-show picture of life in 1920s America for a pair of Polish sisters (Marion Cotillard and Angela Sarafyan) who are separated at Ellis Island when one is discovered to be carrying an illness. Alone and desperate to be reunited with her sister, Cotillard’s character crosses paths with a smooth-talking benefactor (Phoenix) who takes her in so he can use her as one of the attractions in his burlesque show, which functions as a front for a prostitution ring. Trapped and miserable, she finds herself in a grueling downward spiral whose only hope for reversal lies in a good-hearted magician (Jeremy Renner) who just happens to be Phoenix’s brother — and although Renner delivers a few magic tricks during the film, it’s Phoenix who pulls off what might be The Immigrant‘s most impressive feat, imbuing a fairly loathsome character with real emotion and soul. While conceding that the storyline was “the stuff of melodrama,” Tom Long of the Detroit News deemed the film “elevated by Gray’s sure hand and made more by Phoenix and Cotillard, lovers and haters and something beyond.”Watch Trailer3. To Die For (1995)  88%Phoenix started his return from self-imposed acting exile in 1995’s To Die For, a dark look at the modern hunger for fame that showcased a different side of star Nicole Kidman while rescuing director Gus Van Sant from falling into career purgatory after Even Cowgirls Get the Blues. Kidman plays Suzanne Stone, a New Hampshire woman whose dreams of TV stardom are thwarted by the fact that, in her mind, she’s been trapped far from the bright lights and big city by her dullard of a husband (Matt Dillon). Things start to change after she crosses paths with a trio of equally stardom-obsessed kids (Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck, and Alison Folland), inspiring her to solve her spousal problems once and for all. “If you’ve hitherto failed to respond to the laid-back oddball appeal of Van Sant’s movies, fear not,” decreed Geoff Andrew for Time Out. “This is a sharp, consistently funny blend of black comedy and satire on the deleterious effects of television.”Watch Trailer2. Parenthood (1989)  91%It’s hard for any cast member to stand out in the type of crowded ensemble cast that director Ron Howard blended together for 1989’s Parenthood — excepting the picture’s star, Steve Martin, who tied together everyone’s efforts with his sensitive portrayal of a dad struggling to be a good father to his own growing brood while coming to terms with the troubled relationship he has with his own dad. But in one of his first film roles, Phoenix (credited as Leaf) earned a Young Artist Award nomination for his appearance as Martin’s withdrawn nephew; shortly after, in an early display of the uncompromising and occasionally inscrutable approach he’d later have to career management, he took a lengthy break from acting. “It’s hard to imagine a theme more universal and filled with human pitfalls than parenthood,” observed Dennis King for Tulsa World. “And it’s hard to imagine a movie treatment of that theme more humane and filled with gentle sympathy than director Ron Howard’s Parenthood.”Watch Trailer1. Her (2013)  94%Her‘s poster advertises it as a “Spike Jonze love story,” and if you know anything about the director’s knack for quirky artifice in pursuit of nakedly emotional storytelling, you know this isn’t your average romance. Starring Joaquin Phoenix as a lonely, withdrawn writer and Scarlett Johansson’s disembodied voice as the audio expression of some newly installed AI software that wins his heart, Her finds Jonze using a laughably odd — yet not so terribly far-fetched — scenario to explore the evolving nature of love and relationships in the digital era. You need look no further than Phoenix’s mustache for proof that the movie doesn’t take itself too seriously, and yet there’s a wistful, bittersweet melancholy coursing through Her — a quality that, along with the top-notch work of a stellar cast, won the heart of nearly every critic who screened it. Calling it “witty, tender and arrestingly gorgeous,” Hilary A. White of the Irish Independent wrote, “Her is a masterpiece. Phoenix’s central performance is of the lofty levels we have come to expect of him, while Johansson disarms with only her voice.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Finally, here’s a young Joaquin Phoenix acting alongside his brother River in an afterschool special about dyslexia:&nbsp;Click here for Joaquin Phoenix’s complete filmographyRead more Total Recall&nbsp;","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Food, Mary, Syfy, Television, of, harry, kong, Creative, Best, cars, The, Binge, 2020, Epix","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Joaquin-Phoenix.jpg","slug":"joaquin-phoenixs-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508968824213","title":"Discontinued Academy Awards","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Discontinued Academy AwardsWith the Oscars right around the corner, we take a look at the awards the stars won't be taking home this year.by Jeff Giles | January 15, 2015 |  CommentsBefore Hollywood’s best and brightest get all gussied up for the main event on February 22, we take a look back at some of the awards the Academy won’t be handing out — specifically, the ones that have been phased out over the previous 86 ceremonies due to technological progress, redundancy, or a simple lack of popularity among the voters.&nbsp; 86%Academy Juvenile AwardYears Awarded: 1934-60 (off and on)Noteworthy Winners: Given that only a dozen people ever took one home, most of the winners were fairly noteworthy, but the most memorable names on the list include Shirley Temple (who won the very first Juvenile Award Oscar), Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, and Hayley Mills (who won the last one for her work in Pollyanna).Why It Was Retired: Created after a nine-year-old Jackie Cooper lost out for Best Actor in 1931, the Juvenile Award was always a little patronizing — it existed because Academy members felt like child actors were at a disadvantage when competing against their older counterparts, and the statue itself was a half-sized Oscar replica — and over the years, enough younger actors crossed over into the “real” categories that when 16-year-old Patty Duke finally won Best Supporting Actress for her performance in 1963’s The Miracle Worker, age discrimination no longer seemed necessary. 100%Best Assistant DirectorYears Awarded: 1934-37Noteworthy Winners: Clem Beauchamp and Paul Wing, The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935). Neither of them ever became household names, but Beauchamp and Wing both led fascinating lives behind the scenes. Beauchamp abandoned his short-lived acting career (which included a role in Clark Gable’s The Painted Desert) to become a second unit director, then moved into production, working on a long and varied list of films and TV series (such as High Noon, Death of a Salesman, and The Adventures of Superman). Wing, meanwhile, was a World War I veteran when he arrived in Hollywood, and after a few years of (mostly uncredited) studio work, re-enlisted for WWII — during which he endured the Bataan Death March as a prisoner of the Japanese.Why It Was Retired: As anyone who’s spent time on a film set could tell you, it isn’t unusual for the AD to get the short end of the stick — it’s a position that requires a lot of dirty work (e.g. scheduling, budget management, and setting up location shoots) and comes with very little glory. Unlike the awards that were eliminated due to redundancy or changing technology, the Best Assistant Director Oscar could always make a welcome return. 71%Best Dance DirectionYears Awarded: 1935-37Noteworthy Winners: The category’s final winner, Hermes Pan, only took home one Oscar in his career (for “Fun House,” from A Damsel in Distress), but he was one of Hollywood’s most distinguished and in-demand choreographers over the 40-year span between 1928-68, thanks largely to his status as Fred Astaire’s longtime collaborator. A relatively early Pan/Astaire picture, A Damsel in Distress actually lost money for the studio (probably due at least in part to Ginger Rogers’ absence), but there’s no arguing with the cast (which included George Burns and Gracie Allen) or the music, provided by George and Ira Gershwin.Why It Was Retired: These days, a Best Dance Direction Oscar wouldn’t make any sense, but at the time, there was still plenty of hoofing on the big screen. The Best Dance Direction category rankled the DGA, however, and after a few years of insisting that “direction” should only apply to the overall film, they successfully lobbied for its removal.Best Director, Comedy PictureYears Awarded: 1928Noteworthy Winners: Lewis Milestone took home the first and last Best Comedy Direction Oscar for Two Arabian Knights, starring William Boyd and Louis Wolheim as a pair of World War I soldiers whose constant squabbling lands them in a German POW camp — and, eventually, onto a ship bound for Arabia, where both men fall under the spell of a veiled beauty (Mary Astor). Part of a trilogy of Howard Hughes productions that were thought lost for decades, Knights eventually turned up after Hughes’ death, and has been aired by the Turner Classic Movies channel on a couple of recent occasions.Why It Was Retired: Like a lot of other category deductions, it was most likely done under the guise of streamlining the awards by honoring one overall director rather than splitting the nominees between genres, but in light of the Academy’s longstanding perceived bias against comedy, it’s hard to see this decision as anything more than another example of Oscar’s serious nature. 93%Best Engineering EffectsYears Awarded: 1929Noteworthy Winners: Just one: William A. Wellman’s World War I flying drama Wings, which also took home the very first Best Picture Oscar and was (rather incredibly) lost for decades before a spare negative was discovered in the Paramount vaults and meticulously restored. Starring Charles “Buddy” Rogers, Richard Arlen, and future sweethearts Clara Bow and Gary Cooper, the picture benefited from Wellman’s flight experience, as well as then-cutting-edge special effects; today, it’s enshrined in the National Film Registry.Why It Was Retired: The early Oscar years came with a lot of category rejiggering; in fact, at the first ceremony, Best Picture was called Outstanding Picture — and it wasn’t deemed as desirable as Unique and Artistic Production, a category that was dropped the following year. What effects artists lost when this award was eliminated, however, they eventually regained with Special Effects (later renamed Special Visual Effects before finally becoming Visual Effects in 1977). 96%Best Original Musical or Comedy ScoreYears Awarded: 1995-98Noteworthy Winners: While most of the winners leaned one way or the other on the “musical or comedy” spectrum, 1998’s The Full Monty proved a crowd-pleasing blend of both, using a pretty gloomy storyline (about a group of unemployed men who decide to start a burlesque show in order to make ends meet) as the basis for a surprisingly thoughtful comedy with a feel-good soundtrack — including what might be the best-ever use of Tom Jones’ cover of the Randy Newman classic “You Can Leave Your Hat On.” The award for the score, however, went to Anne Dudley — the composer fondly remembered by children of the 1980s as a member of the avant garde synthpop band Art of Noise.Why It Was Retired: The Academy has changed its approach to awarding musicians and composers many times over the years, and this award — designed to give songwriters and lyricists a chance at Oscardom — is just one short-lived example. 83%Best Score – Adaptation or TreatmentYears Awarded: 1962-67Noteworthy Winners: This Academy Award, created to honor the composers who worked on big-screen adaptations of stage musicals, happened to have its run during a pretty good stretch for the genre — The Sound of Music, The Music Man, and My Fair Lady were all honored during the Best Score – Adaptation or Treatment’s brief existence, along with Irma la Douce, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and Camelot.Why It Was Retired: Prior to this category’s introduction, music was honored with the Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture and Scoring of a Musical Picture Oscars; after it was phased out, the Academy moved on to the Original Score for a Motion Picture (not a Musical) and Score of a Musical Picture – Original or Adaptation categories. A bit of semantics, in other words.Best Short Subject – ColorYears Awarded: 1936-37Noteworthy Winners: We’ve only got two winners in this category: B. Reeves Eason’s Give Me Liberty and David Miller’s Penny Wisdom, a comedy about the culinary horror that unfolds after an inept homemaker’s cook quits just as the man of the house is bringing home his boss and a client for dinner. Of the two, Eason’s film might be more interesting, if only because it was his work as a second-unit director on Charge of the Light Brigade that led to one of the most scandalous animal slaughters in Hollywood history — and the presence of the Humane Society on film sets for decades to follow.Why It Was Retired: With the advent of color film, a separate designation for the medium was no longer necessary; today, Oscar honors film shorts in three separate categories: Live Action, Animated, and Documentary.Best Short Subject – ComedyYears Awarded: 1932-35Noteworthy Winners: The first winner, 1932’s The Music Box, was a Hal Roach production starring Laurel and Hardy as a pair of inept movers tasked with getting a player piano up an insurmountably long stairway. Less than half an hour in length, Box made a big impact, to the extent that the steps themselves (in Los Angeles’ Silver Lake district) have become something of a tourist destination — and the short itself was inducted into the National Film Registry in 1997.Why It Was Retired: The Academy has often displayed a certain degree of ambivalence when it comes to comedy, but in this case, the category’s removal had more to do with a shift away from dividing live-action shorts by genre.Best Short Subject – Live Action Two ReelsYears Awarded: 1936-56Noteworthy Winners: A fair number of these shorts have been lost to the vagaries of time, but that doesn’t mean they were any less distinguished — in fact, some of the directors who were nominated or won included legendary producer Irving Allen, prolific documentarian Gordon Hollingshead, frequent Three Stooges helmer Jules White, and sports writer Grantland Rice.Why It Was Retired: After 1956, the Academy no longer needed to differentiate between one-reel and two-reel shorts, and switched to the Short Subjects, Live Action Subjects category, which eventually morphed into Live Action Short Film in 1974.Best Short Subject – NoveltyYears Awarded: 1932-35Noteworthy Winners: The Novelty category was used as a sort of catchall for a number of films, such as Pete Smith’s patronizing, gently humorous domestic instruction manual Menu. The winners, however, tended toward the documentary end of the spectrum — and since movies like Krakatoa and Wings Over Everest showed viewers parts of the world they were unlikely to ever visit, it could be argued that all of them were noteworthy (even 1934’s City of Wax, which took a look at the life of a bee).Why It Was Retired: In 1936 and 1937, the Academy refined its approach to awarding short films by splitting the nominees into Color, One-Reel, and Two-Reel categories, then dropping the Color category in 1938.Best Title WritingYears Awarded: 1929Noteworthy Winners: We only have one to choose from: Joseph Farnham, a playwright, screenwriter, and film editor whose life story boasts a few distinctions. Not only did Farnham take home the first and last Oscar for Best Title Writing, he was also one of the founding members of the Academy — and in 1931, he sadly became the first award winner to die, succumbing to a heart attack at the age of 47.Why It Was Retired: With “talkies” already taking over Hollywood, fewer and fewer films needed title cards to spell out dialogue or explain plot developments, and by the time the second Academy Awards were held in April 1930, the Best Title Writing category was a thing of the past. 98%Best Unique and Artistic Quality of ProductionYears Awarded: 1929Noteworthy Winners: There was only one: F.W. Murnau’s Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans, starring George O’Brien as a man tempted to stray from the bonds of his marriage by a floozy from the big city (Margaret Livingston) who nearly convinces him to murder his wife (Janet Gaynor, the year’s Best Actress winner) before he changes his mind and — after a storm nearly separates them forever — they find their way back to happy matrimony. Boasting groundbreaking Academy Award-winning cinematography and finely distinctive set design to go with its admittedly rather simplistic and fanciful story, Sunrise was the year’s big Oscar winner; today, it resides in the National Film Registry (as well as on a number of critical all-time best lists).Why It Was Retired: Viewed by many as a redundant clone of the Best Picture award (which was referred to as Outstanding Picture at the first ceremony), Unique and Artistic Quality of Production was one of three categories phased out after the first Academy Awards.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"VOD, Rocketman, Family, independent, TV, Lifetime, wars, kong, Disney+, The, Now, Adventures","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Discontinued-Oscars.jpg","slug":"discontinued-academy-awards"},{"id":"47508971546031","title":"Angelina Jolie’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Angelina Jolie's 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Maleficent star.by Jeff Giles | May 29, 2014 |  CommentsBoth on and off the screen, Angelina Jolie has been one of the film industry’s most eminently watchable celebrities for over a decade. Whether she’s appearing in big-budget blockbusters (Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith), more thoughtful dramas (Changeling), or animated features the whole family can enjoy (Kung Fu Panda) — or simply hypnotizing the paparazzi with her tabloid-friendly lifestyle — Jolie hasn’t strayed far from the spotlight since earning raves for her Emmy-nominated performance in HBO’s Gia. In honor of her appearance in the title role of Disney’s Maleficent this weekend, we decided to revisit the critical highlights of her billion-dollar filmography by counting down her ten best-reviewed performances. It’s time for Total Recall, Angelina Jolie style! 53%10. Girl, InterruptedOn paper, Girl, Interrupted looked like a star vehicle for Winona Ryder, who took a producer’s credit and the leading role in this adaptation of Susanna Keysen’s memoir about her stint in a Massachusetts mental hospital during the late 1960s. But if Interrupted was Keysen’s story, it was a story largely told through her relationships with her fellow patients — especially her conflicted friendship with Lisa Rowe, a diagnosed sociopath whose deep rage and utter lack of boundaries help Susanna confront her own problems. Lisa would have been a showy role for any actress, but for Angelina Jolie, she became a scene-stealing character who breathed a new level of energy into the movie; it was a performance that earned Jolie her first Academy Award, and it proved that her critically acclaimed performance in HBO’s Gia was no fluke. Writing for ReelTalk Movie Reviews, Betty Jo Tucker applauded, “Jolie enlivens every scene she’s in — so much so that whenever she’s not on screen, many viewers go into a state of suspended animation waiting for her to come back.” 55%9. The Good ShepherdYou might not think a nearly three-hour drama about the formation of the CIA would make for interesting viewing, and based on the reception afforded 2006’s The Good Shepherd, most critics (and many of your fellow filmgoers) would agree: though it recouped its budget, Shepherd didn’t achieve the level of box office success you’d expect from a film starring Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, and Robert De Niro — and though the reviews were generally full of praise for the stars’ performances, they also included a lot of words like “bloated,” “tortuously paced,” and “too long.” Still, it’s easy to see why director and grown-up Cold War kid De Niro was drawn to the story, and its nearly 30-year sprawl must have been appealing to Damon and Jolie, whose characters met, married, had a child, and drifted apart, all while the nascent CIA worked its way into every facet of their lives. Go into it expecting action and you’ll be disappointed — but as Andrew Sarris wrote for the New York Observer, “No previous American film has ventured into this still largely unknown territory with such authority and emotional detachment. For this reason alone, The Good Shepherd is must-see viewing.” 60%8. Mr. &amp; Mrs. SmithTake The War of the Roses, inject it with some loud, glossy, big-budget action, add a dash of potent sexy chemistry between your stars, and you’ve got 2005’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith — as well as a pretty fantastic formula for a blockbuster summer flick. Smith could easily have been overshadowed by all the tabloid speculation that dogged Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s relationship; this is, after all, the movie that gave the world Brangelina. But if filmgoers came for glimpses of real-life sparks, they stayed for the snappy one-liners in Simon Kinberg’s script, director Doug Liman’s well-staged (albeit thoroughly ludicrous) action set pieces, and the sheer spectacle of two very attractive people dispatching bad guys and blowing stuff up while they decide whether they want to stay married or kill each other. It certainly isn’t high art, but the movie has a fizzy charm that Roger Ebert summed up by writing, “What makes the movie work is that Pitt and Jolie have fun together on the screen, and they’re able to find a rhythm that allows them to be understated and amused even during the most alarming developments.” 60%7. Playing by HeartIn spite of a cast of marquee-lighting veterans that included Sean Connery, Dennis Quaid, Madeleine Stowe, and Ellen Burstyn, this ensemble romantic dramedy sank virtually without a trace after it bowed in December of 1998. But as far as most critics were concerned, Playing by Heart‘s failure was the filmgoer’s loss; though some scribes came away frustrated with director-writer Willard Carroll’s talky script, and others rolled their eyes at the way the hitherto unseen ties between the movie’s characters were revealed in the final act, the generally strong performances from the cast more than made up for any flaws. Somewhat surprisingly, given some of her co-stars’ pedigrees, it was Jolie who earned the most significant praise, including a Breakthrough Performance award from the National Board of Review and glowing reviews from the likes of Film Threat’s Ron Wells, who wrote, “The brightest spot belongs to Angelina Jolie, who is so compelling to watch she has chemistry with the furniture.” (Or Ryan Phillippe.) 61%6. SaltJust about every film production endures its share of setbacks, but Salt went through a particularly tortured development process, with original lead Tom Cruise departing and the script undergoing a significant overhaul en route to the project re-emerging as a starring vehicle for Angelina Jolie. Fortunately, Jolie’s just as capable as anyone of playing a butt-kicking spy on the run, and Salt‘s roughly $300 million in worldwide grosses offer compelling proof that audiences agree. Although critics were far from unanimous in their praise of the Phillip Noyce-directed thriller, the majority sided with Movie Talk’s Jason Best, who wrote, “Casting a lithe Jolie as the film’s protagonist stops Salt from being a Bourne knock-off or a Mission: Impossible reboot and gives the tired espionage genre a novel twist.” 62%5. ChangelingShe has a clear fondness for popcorn flicks, but on occasion, Angelina Jolie also likes to remind us that she can act — and she did just that with 2008’s Changeling, earning a stack of critical praise and an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of Christine Collins, a Los Angeles woman whose son’s abduction in 1928 was only the beginning of an unbelievable ordeal that would go on to include her forced institutionalization, multiple lawsuits, the temporary removal of two high-ranking LAPD officers, and one of the most callous, bizarre cover-ups in law enforcement history. The fact-based Changeling is a textbook example of truth being stranger than fiction, but as hard as it might be to believe its story, the movie probes at some dark truths about how American attitudes toward women have changed (and, sadly, how some of them haven’t). A modest American box office success, it also gave Jolie the opportunity to work with director Clint Eastwood, whose minimalistic style allowed Changeling to fail or succeed on her ability to carry her role. It was a gambit that paid off, according to Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger, who wrote, “This is one movie where the star really is the star. And delivers a performance of which any actress can be truly proud.” 71%4. BeowulfHow do you turn one of humanity’s oldest works of literature into a $200 million hit at the box office? Hire Robert Zemeckis to turn it into a 3-D burst of mo-cap eye candy — and cast Angelina Jolie as Grendel’s mother, whose decidedly reptilian appearance stands at odds with her disdain for clothing. As the New York Times’ Manohla Dargis noted, “You don’t need to wait for Angelina Jolie to rise from the vaporous depths naked to know that this Beowulf isn’t your high school teacher’s Old English epic poem.” This might have been a problem for lit professors who chafed at Zemeckis’ thirst for spectacle over story, but for filmgoers — as well as most critics — the ’07 edition of one of the original warrior vs. monster epics provided a welcome update to a story that freshmen have been sleeping through for decades. 71%3. WantedAs if all the explosions, assassins, and curving bullets weren’t enough, Timur Bekmambetov’s big-screen adaptation of Mark Millar’s comic book miniseries also boasted a mighty fine cast, including Morgan Freeman, James McAvoy, and — as the deadly, perfectly named Fox — Angelina Jolie. Of course, that doesn’t mean Wanted required much in the way of actual acting; its storyline, about a guild of constantly double-crossing assassins who draw their recently assassinated colleague’s son into a web of murderous intrigue, is really only there to connect the many action sequences. But oh, what action: even by the super-caffeinated standards of post-Matrix Hollywood, Wanted serves up an impressive stack of visual thrills. That was enough for filmgoers, who generated nearly $350 million in worldwide grosses — and most critics agreed with the popcorn-gobbling masses, granting Wanted a Certified Fresh rating on the strength of positive reviews from scribes such as the New York Post’s Kyle Smith, who called it “A 12-armed heavy-metal drummer of a movie, kicking and flailing through two hours of impossible.” 70%2. Sky Captain and the World of TomorrowOne of the most technologically intriguing releases of 2004, Kerry Conran’s Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow was sort of a beta Avatar, combining live action and computer-generated effects in new and exciting ways. Adding to the gee-whiz factor was Conran’s gleefully retro storyline, which pitted the heroic Sky Captain (Jude Law) and a Royal Navy led by the eyepatch-rocking Francesca “Franky” Cook (Jolie) against the giant robot army of the nefarious Dr. Totenkopf (Sir Laurence Olivier, in a display of technology both thrilling and sort of creepy) in an alternate version of 1939. Captain mimicked the Golden Age matinee serials so successfully that many modern filmgoers didn’t quite know what to make of it, and as a result, it went the fate of Totenkopf’s army at the box office — but it was welcomed with open arms by critics like Ed Park of the Village Voice, who wrote, “His nostalgia enabled by technology, Conran takes the ghosts in his machine seriously, and the results appear at once meltingly lovely and intriguingly inhuman.” 79%1. A Mighty HeartFilmgoers have shown a resolute unwillingness to turn out for movies having anything to do with 9/11 or its aftermath, and A Mighty Heart was no different, grossing only $18 million during its brief run at the box office. This wasn’t a reflection of the movie’s quality, though; most critics agreed that this dramatization of the search for journalist Daniel Pearl, who was kidnapped and brutally murdered by terrorists in 2002, did justice to its tragic tale. Pearl’s wife Mariane, who wrote the memoir A Mighty Heart is based on, personally chose Angelina Jolie to play her in the film — and though some critics carped that Mariane’s biracial heritage should have precluded Jolie from taking the role, the majority applauded her strong performance, among them James Mottram of Film4, who wrote, “If Winterbottom struggles to shoehorn his documentary style into the form of a thriller, Jolie has no problems in bringing Mariane to life with a vibrant and vital turn. This honourable film is worth seeing for her alone.”In case you were wondering, here are Jolie’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Girl, Interrupted — 84%2. Changeling — 82%3. Playing by Heart — 80%4. Gone in 60 Seconds — 77%5. Beyond Borders — 73%6. A Mighty Heart — 70%7. Wanted — 69%8. Hackers — 69%9. Foxfire — 66%10.

With Boyhood opening in limited release this weekend, we decided to take the opportunity to have a look at Hawke’s filmography — and although it’s as stuffed with Linklater collaborations as you might expect, there’s also a lot more going on here, including some of the most cherished movies of the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond. Cast off that planet of regret sitting on your shoulders, because it’s time for Total Recall!10. Explorers 74%Between 1985’s Explorers and 1986’s Space Camp, the mid-’80s were a pretty great time for young astronauts at the movies — and although neither picture did all that well at the box office, the former film has gone on to enjoy cult status. This is partly thanks to Joe Dante’s ever-effusive direction of a sweet-tempered Eric Luke screenplay about neighborhood pals who use spare parts, computer know how, and a ton of youthful gumption to man their own space expedition — but it also didn’t hurt that Dante had a terrific young cast to work with, including Hawke (as Ben, the kid who dreams of traveling into space) and River Phoenix (as his computer-wiz pal Wolfgang). Explorers isn’t without its problems, among them a final act that many critics felt was a letdown after the refreshing fun of the buildup, but it still adds up to what Film4’s Daniel Etherington called “An enjoyable, quintessentially 1980s science-fiction adventure, full of wit and crafty pop culture references.”9. Tape 77%The camcorder auteur version of Old Home Week, 2001’s Tape reunited Ethan Hawke with a frequent collaborator (director Richard Linklater), a former co-star (Robert Sean Leonard, who’d worked with him in Dead Poets Society), and his then-current spouse (Uma Thurman) to deliver a tightly wound adaptation of the Stephen Belber play about an increasingly unpleasant encounter between a pair of old high school buddies, fraught with the tension caused by the fact that one (Leonard) has a budding filmmaking career while the other (Hawke) is a small-town drug dealer living in hotel squalor — not to mention their shared history with a former girlfriend who’s still in the area (Thurman). It isn’t the cheeriest viewing or the prettiest movie to look at, but as a can’t-look-away drama and an example of Linklater’s ability to successfully test cinematic limits, it’s pretty darn compelling. “Three actors yakking in a single drab interior, shot on HD video,” marveled Variety’s Dennis Harvey. “It’s unlikely this poverty-program recipe has, or ever will again, yield results quite as entertaining as Tape.”8. Waking Life 81%Richard Linklater sure was busy during the months leading up to the 2001 Sundance Festival. Not only did he complete Tape, the ensemble camcorder drama that reunited him with frequent muse Ethan Hawke, but he also turned in Waking Life, an ambitious blend of heady intellectual themes and eye-catching visual effects. Framed by the journey of a young man (played by Dazed and Confused star Wiley Wiggins) through a city filled with a motley assortment of blue-collar philosophers and intriguing weirdos — portrayed by “interpolated rotoscoping”-ized versions of Hawke, Julie Delpy, Adam Goldberg, Nicky Katt, and others — Waking offers food for thought and a distinctive treat for the eyes. Calling it “Exhilarating, transporting, funny and haunting — and at times maddeningly heady or narcotically logy,” Salon’s Stephanie Zacharek decreed, “Waking Life doesn’t compare to any other movie experience I’ve ever had.”7. Gattaca 83%In 1996, Dolly the sheep made headlines as the first cloned mammal, sending previously sci-fi-worthy topics like genetic engineering and eugenics to the forefront of public debate. You’d think that would make an instant smash out of a futuristic thriller about a man hiding behind someone else’s genetic identity — Columbia Pictures certainly thought so — but Andrew Niccol’s Gattaca still went down as one of 1997’s more notorious flops. Hawke starred as Vincent Freeman, a genetic “in-valid” who flouts the rules preventing him from joining the space program by buying off Jerome Morrow (Jude Law), a paraplegic ex-swimmer with perfect DNA, setting in motion a chain of events that puts Freeman on a collision course with a squad of detectives led by his own brother (Loren Dean). It’s undeniably juicy stuff, and it was greeted with critical applause, but audiences weren’t interested for some reason — a disappointment for scribes like James Sanford, who called it “a smart, beautifully crafted piece of not-so-science-fiction that manages to successfully mix social commentary and suspense into a generally enthralling story.”6. Dead Poets Society 84%A four-time Oscar nominee and one of the defining dramas of the late ’80s, Dead Poets Society found Robin Williams toning down his eminently bankable manic persona in order to anchor this late ’50s-set tale of non-conformity and self-belief with a performance of surprisingly subtle strength. As prep school teacher John Keating, Williams led a young standout cast that included Hawke, Josh Charles, Robert Sean Leonard, and Gale Hansen, as well as dependable grown-up supporting players such as Kurtwood Smith, Norman Lloyd, and Lara Flynn Boyle. A resounding $200 million-plus hit that entered the phrase “O Captain! My Captain!” into the popular lexicon, Poets also found purchase with critics like Moviehole’s Clint Morris, who assured readers, “If you’ve done some living, every cockle of your heart will be touched.”5. A Midnight Clear 88%A Christmas-set WWII drama about the mounting tensions at an American GI camp, A Midnight Clear didn’t have much of a prayer at the box office in April of 1992, no matter how intriguing its cast may have been — and it was plenty intriguing, featuring standout work from Hawke and Gary Sinise, as well as solid performances from Peter Berg, Arye Gross, Frank Whaley, and Kevin Dillon. But if it missed its shot with audiences, it still resonated strongly with critics, who turned in largely positive reviews; in fact, as far as Jon Niccum of the Lawrence Journal-World was concerned, A Midnight Clear is “one of the most underrated films of the ’90s.”4. Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead 88%A powerful late-period triumph for director Sidney Lumet, Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead offered Hawke an opportunity to deliver some of his best work surrounded by masters — not only behind the scenes, but in front of the cameras, where he shared screen time with a powerful ensemble cast that included Philip Seymour Hoffman, Albert Finney, Marisa Tomei, and Michael Shannon. Although the results were far from an easy watch, that clammy feeling you have while viewing Devil serves a purpose, adding a memorably pungent component to the film that Variety’s Lisa Nesselson called a “wrenching tale [that] has something for anyone who likes their melodrama spiked with palpable tension and genuine suspense.”3. Before Sunset 94%Before Sunrise wasn’t a huge hit, but it acquired cult classic status, and Hawke formed a bond with Julie Delpy and writer-director Richard Linklater — so much so that the trio never really let go of their Sunrise roles, with Hawke and Delpy playing their characters in Linklater’s rotoscoped 2001 drama Waking Life while the three of them periodically returned to the idea of a sequel. That follow-up finally arrived in 2004 with Before Sunset, which finds Jesse and Celine meeting up again nine years after the events depicted in the first film and spending a memorable afternoon together in Paris. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the passage of time had dimmed neither the duo’s chemistry nor diminished their characters’ story potential; as Christy Lemire appreciatively observed for the Associated Press, “It’s a lovely, beguiling little film — a rare treat during this overheated season of blockbusters. It’s also an unusual example of a follow-up that doesn’t seem forced, but expands effortlessly on the original.”2. Before Midnight 98%Nearly a decade after Before Sunset and almost 20 years after Before Sunrise, Hawke and Julie Delpy concluded writer-director Richard Linklater’s trilogy the same way they started it — namely, by offering a frank, naturalistic look at love in its various stages. As with the previous two installments, Before Midnight leans heavily on its stars’ chemistry — and once again, they prove more than up to the task, lending rich dramatic hues to a movie that, in lesser hands, would seem like little more than a lot of self-indulgent navel-gazing. For critics hoping for a clear-eyed take on midlife domesticity and filmgoers who just wanted to see the next chapter in Jesse and Celine’s story, Midnight proved every bit as lovely (and sometimes just as dark) as its title; as Moira MacDonald wrote for the Seattle Times, “Though Before Midnight is often uncomfortable to watch, it’s never less than mesmerizing — and ultimately, a joy to walk with this prickly but fascinating couple again.”1. Before Sunrise 100%Looking at this list, it’s hard not to wonder if maybe Ethan Hawke should only make movies with “before” in the title — or barring that, always co-star with Julie Delpy. The duo’s richly rewarding on-screen courtship kicks off with Before Sunrise, in which Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) meet on a train and spend a night walking and talking through the streets of Vienna, developing a bond even as the hour draws nigh for Jesse to begin his scheduled journey back home to the U.S. It isn’t the flashiest premise for a film, but it obviously didn’t need to be — Before Sunrise enraptured critics, made romantic filmgoers swoon, and spawned a trilogy that slowly unspooled over the ensuing two decades. “Hawke and Delpy keep the tone not only afloat but mesmerizing,” enthused Phil Villarreal for the Arizona Daily Star. “So natural are their performances that it seems impossible not to believe they truly are soulmates who are locked in a doomed, all-too-short affair.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Yes, we would have sniffed up those early stinkers Doom and Be Cool, because at least nestled somewhere in there was The Rundown, which featured peak Seann William Scott and a cameo from Arnold Schwarzenegger passing the action torch to this upstart, the man who would be Dwayne Johnson. And indeed Johnson was the action man of the mid-aughts, tacking on the likes of Walking Tall to his brawny resume. And like his action forebears, he made a curve into family comedy, releasing The Game Plan, The Tooth Fairy, and Race to Witch Mountain to the delight, we assume, of some people. On a scale between Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot to Kindergarten Cop, we rate Johnson’s comedy career detour Top Dog.But things turned around in 2010. That’s the year he jumped face first off a building into the pavement. And thus was born a new action/comedy classic: The Other Guys. Meanwhile, ’70s-style throwback Faster showed a leaner, meaner Johnson back in a hard-hitting groove. He was invited into the Fast &amp; Furious family, helping turn Fast Five into the franchise’s first Certified Fresh entry and a global phenomenon. San Andreas, Rampage, and Skyscraper turned him into the master of disaster, while Moana and Fighting With My Family, which he also produced, are among his highest-rated movies.Central Intelligence was the first collaboration Johnson had with Kevin Hart, which was merely the opening for the main course: Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, the unlikely reboot-sequel that connected with audiences and critics worldwide.

This weekend, Connelly helps round out an all-star cast in the supernatural drama Winter’s Tale, and to help mark her appearance in Akiva Goldsman’s magical, century-spanning Manhattan love story, we decided to dedicate our latest list to an appreciative look back at some of her finest performances. It’s time for Total Recall! 62%10. HulkIt’s the gamma radiation in his body that makes him the Hulk, but Dr. Bruce Banner is equally defined by his love for Betty Ross, so any Hulk movie worth its salt needs to have a beautiful Betty to go along with its rampaging big green guy. Whatever its faults, Ang Lee’s 2003 Hulk picked a terrific Betty in Connelly, who helped anchor some of the movie’s more CGI-driven flights of fancy with her performance as the only woman on Earth capable of soothing Eric Bana’s savage beast. “Audiences expecting to turn off their brains and sit back for another blast of mere eye candy may stagger out of this 138-minute epic wondering what hit them,” gasped Looking Closer’s Jeffrey Overstreet. 73%9. LabyrinthGeorge Lucas produced and Jim Henson directed! In 1986, what more could a film fan ask for? Well, for those hoping for more than a bumpy blend of camp and dark fantasy with a surreal David Bowie musical number thrown in, the answer was “quite a lot” — but even if it wasn’t the hit it was cracked up to be, Labyrinth has gone on to become a cult favorite for a lot of easily defensible reasons, including Henson’s always-captivating puppet design and some watchable work from a young Connelly as Sarah, the brave teenager who has to venture into a magical world to save her baby brother after she inadvertently summons goblins to kidnap him. Calling it “An innovative mix of sophisticated puppetry and special effects,” the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Steven Rea wrote, “Labyrinth has all the components of classic myth.” 71%8. The Hot SpotDirector Dennis Hopper took an appropriately visual approach to his adaptation of Charles Williams’ novel Hell Hath No Fury, right down to the utterly lovely cast he assembled: Don Johnson, fresh off Miami Vice, as troublesome drifter Harry Madox; a drawling Virginia Madsen as Madox’s boss’s sultry wife; and Connelly as his deceptively wholesome secretary. It’s all more than a little silly, but Hopper definitely understood how to spin a noirish yarn — and how to film a few scenes that left a generation of VHS renters scrambling for the pause button. “Hot Spot will never go down as timeless, neoclassic noir,” admitted Desson Thomson of the Washington Post. “But, with its Hopperlike moments, over-the-top performances and infectious music, it carries you along for a spell.” 76%7. Dark CityThe protagonist who has no memory of his past, but must find a way to evade capture for crimes he’s sure he didn’t commit: It’s a tale as old as noir, but Alex Proyas’ Dark City tells it with singularly stylish flair, starring Rufus Sewell as an unfortunate soul who wakes up in a bathtub, takes a phone call warning him that men are on their way to capture him, and stumbles across a dead woman on his way out the door. Toss in his estranged wife (Connelly), a city where the sun never shines, a human race prone to random comas, and a telekinetic battle between our hero and a shadowy cabal known as the Strangers, and Dark City is unlike any mindbending love story/trippy action thriller you’ve ever seen; as Stephen Holden argued in his review for the New York Times, it’s “so relentlessly trippy in a fun-house sort of way that it could very easily inspire a daredevil cult of moviegoers who go back again and again to experience its mind-bending twists and turns.” 76%6. Phenomena (Creepers)Connelly’s brief appearance in Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in America impressed director Dario Argento, who was so taken that he gave her the lead in his 1984 thriller Phenomena (later edited and retitled Creepers for the U.S. market). Argento later called it his most personal film, but it’s just as weird and thickly atmospheric as the rest of his best work; the storyline centers around a boarding school student (Connelly) whose ability to communicate telepathically with insects piques the interest of an entomologist (Donald Pleasance) who hopes to use her gifts to help catch a serial killer. While it proved too gruesomely surreal for many critics (Jon Pareles of the New York Times quipped that “the best acting is by an expressive, resourceful chimpanzee”), for others it was vintage Argento; “We’re on ground he’s covered before,” admitted Eye for Film’s Jennie Kermode, “but it’s constantly shifting beneath us.” 74%5. House of Sand and FogBased on Andre Dubus III’s brutally sad novel, House of Sand and Fog finds director Vadim Perelman taking the audience on a grim — but altogether compelling — odyssey of intractable conflict between a recovering addict (Connelly) and the Iranian immigrant (Ben Kingsley) who purchased her house in an auction sale triggered by a tax misunderstanding with the county. Neither side is wrong, but neither character is totally sympathetic, and as their shared intransigence raises the awful stakes, Perelman makes the viewer complicit in the inexorable conclusion. “In the current political climate, it’s required viewing,” wrote Glenn Lovell for the San Jose Mercury News. “We all need to think about tolerance and how, like sand, it can slip through our fingers.” 74%4. A Beautiful MindFollowing her critically lauded appearance in Requiem for a Dream, Connelly reunited with her Inventing the Abbotts producer, Ron Howard, for 2001’s A Beautiful Mind, in which Howard directed a dramatization of brilliant mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr.’s struggles with mental illness. Starring Russell Crowe as Nash and Connelly as his wife Alicia, Mind proved a critical and commercial sensation, earning more than $300 million in worldwide grosses and netting eight Academy Award nominations (four of which it took home, including Connelly’s Best Supporting Actress win). Although she’d been migrating toward more serious adult fare for years, A Beautiful Mind announced Connelly’s evolution from young star to grown-up thespian on a worldwide stage; as A.O. Scott noted in his review for the New York Times, “Ms. Connelly [is] keen and spirited in the underwritten role of a woman who starts out as a math groupie and soon finds herself the helpmeet of a disturbed, difficult man.” 79%3. Requiem for a DreamLike the Hubert Selby, Jr. novel from which it’s adapted, Darren Aronofsky’s Requiem for a Dream is certainly not for everyone. An unflinching look at the misery of addiction, Requiem follows the hellish descents of a widow named Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and Harry’s friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). After 102 minutes, all four characters have been pretty well run through the wringer; Burstyn winds up institutionalized, Leto loses an arm, Wayans has to go cold turkey in a jail cell — and Connelly crosses paths with Big Tim, played with thoroughly skeevy élan by Keith David. Good taste prevents us from getting into the exact nature of their relationship; suffice it to say that Connelly’s character arc demonstrates that some people will do just about anything to get their fix, and David’s performance reminds us that other people will stop at nothing to take advantage of an addict. “Never have we been taken this close to the edge, and never have the characters teetering over it elicited so much sympathy,” wrote Eugene Novikov of Film Blather. “Requiem is difficult to watch, but it richly rewards those who stay with it.” 80%2. Little ChildrenThe middle aughts found Connelly selecting a series of markedly grim scripts, from House of Sand and Fog to Dark Water, Blood Diamond, and Reservation Road — and including Little Children, writer/director Todd Field’s adaptation of the Tom Perrotta novel about a suburban community whose beautiful facade masks untold conflicts — and whose carefully calibrated order is disrupted by the arrival of a registered sex offender (Jackie Earle Haley). It’s the kind of yarn that’s been spun countless times over the last few decades, but many critics still took fresh pleasure from this particular telling — including J.R. Jones, whose Chicago Reader review argued, “the characters are drawn with such compassion their follies become our own and their desires seem as vast as the night sky.” 80%1. PollockA longtime passion project for Ed Harris, Pollock offers filmgoers a warts-and-all biopic of painter Jackson Pollock, an artistic genius whose process was as infamously messy as his personal life. The project’s director as well as its star, Harris rounded out Pollock‘s cast with tremendously talented actors, including Marcia Gay Harden, Amy Madigan, Jeffrey Tambor, and Connelly — who played Pollock’s muse and extramarital paramour, Ruth Kligman. Harris was nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award and Harden won Best Supporting Actress, leading a film full of fine performances that inspired Margaret A. McGurk of the Cincinnati Enquirer to write, “If ever there were an artist to prove that the art is bigger than the artist, it was Jackson Pollock. Like him, this film embraces pain and chaos and self-loathing and returns beauty.”In case you were wondering, here are Connelly’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. A Beautiful Mind — 93%2. Requiem for a Dream — 93%3. Blood Diamond — 90%4. Labyrinth — 86%5. Dark City — 85%6. House of Sand and Fog — 83%7. Little Children — 82%8. Waking the Dead — 78%9. Higher Learning — 75%10.

To celebrate the return of the smartest talking dog in ‘toondom and his precocious ward, we decided to honor our stars by rounding up a list of some other noteworthy time-travel movies — and while none of them feature canine inventors, we think you’ll find more than a few favorites. It’s time for Total Recall!Back to the Future 96%Great Scott! On one hand, Back to the Future is quintessentially 1980s — you’ve got Huey Lewis on the soundtrack, Michael J. Fox in the lead, and a DeLorean for a time machine — but on the other, it’s a charmingly old-fashioned comedy that sends its hero back in time as much to save his own father from growing up to be a schmuck as it does to laugh along with the audience at the many ways in which American pop culture changed between 1955 and 1985. The sequels had their moments, but it’s the original that still really hits the spot; as Adam Smith wrote for Empire Magazine, “To put it bluntly: if you don’t like Back to the Future, it’s difficult to believe that you like films at all.”Bill &amp; Ted’s Excellent Adventure 81%Two teenage idiots, George Carlin, and a magic phone booth. They don’t sound like the most likely ingredients for cinematic glory, but then there’s Bill &amp; Ted’s Excellent Adventure, starring Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves as our two non-intrepid heroes, a pair of high school buddies destined for greatness — but only if they can pass an upcoming history test. They get a little extra help courtesy of Rufus (Carlin), a citizen of the future utopian society inspired by the music Bill &amp; Ted go on to record, who travels back in time to help them study by giving them some most excellent face time with historical figures like Napoleon, Socrates, Billy the Kid, and Abraham Lincoln. Not the most serious fare ever spun from the time-travel premise, but it works; as Larry Carroll wrote for Counting Down, “This is the rare kind of movie that you could watch along with your kids and actually feel like you’re teaching them something.”Donnie Darko 86%Time travel, a falling jet engine, and a dude in a bunny suit: From these disparate ingredients, writer-director Richard Kelly wove the tale of Donnie Darko, a suburban teenager (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) charged with repairing a rift in the fabric of our dimension. Or something. To call Darko “open to interpretation” would be understating the case a bit — it’s been alternately confounding and delighting audiences since it was released in 2001 — but its dense, ambiguous plot found stronger purchase with critics, who cared less about what it all meant than about simply having the chance to see an American movie that took some substantial risks. Though a few reviewers were confused and/or unimpressed (Staci Lynne Wilson of Fantastica Daily called it “derivative,” and Joe Leydon dismissed it as “a discombobulating muddle” in his write-up for the San Francisco Examiner), overall critical opinion proved a harbinger of the cult status the film would eventually enjoy on the home video market; as Thomas Delapa wrote for the Boulder Weekly, “If the sum total of Donnie Darko is hard to figure, there’s no questioning that its separate scenes add up to breathtaking filmmaking.” Despite a paltry $4.1 million gross during its original limited run, Darko returned to theaters in 2004 with a director’s cut — one whose 91 percent Tomatometer actually improved upon the original’s.Groundhog Day 96%Under the right circumstances, time travel sounds like quite a bit of fun. Finding yourself trapped in a time loop in Punxsutawney, PA, on the other hand, is a living nightmare — at least for Phil Connors (Bill Murray), the obnoxious newscaster at the heart of director Harold Ramis’ classic 1993 comedy Groundhog Day. But for the audience, Connors’ torment is an invitation to cinematic bliss — first courtesy of Murray’s perfectly deadpan depiction of the callous Connors, then through his progressively more unhinged reaction to the discovery that he’s doomed to repeat the same 24 hours of his life seemingly forever, and then finally in his expected (but no less sweet) moments of self-discovery in the final act. “Groundhog Day may not be the funniest collaboration between Bill Murray and director Harold Ramis,” admitted the Los Angeles Times’ Kenneth Turan. “Yet this gentle, small-scale effort is easily the most endearing film of both men’s careers, a sweet and amusing surprise package.”Hot Tub Time Machine 64%The 1980s got kind of a bum rap at the time, but that hasn’t stopped those of us who grew up during the decade from giving in to nostalgia during the 21st century, or from fetishizing the era’s best films — which is why it was such a winkingly self-referential treat to see 1980s hero John Cusack lead an ensemble cast through Hot Tub Time Machine, director Steve Pink’s ribald comedy about a group of schlubby friends given a surprise chance (via magic hot tub, natch) to revisit the best years of their lives. It’s an unabashedly goofy premise, but screenwriter Josh Heald manages to leave&nbsp;the whimsy with a few dashes of surprising poignancy; as Laremy Legel wrote for Film.com, “Well played, Hot Tub Time Machine, well played. You defied expectations, in a good way, and managed to evolve from ‘potentially silly concept’ to ‘fairly funny film.'”Looper 93%Plenty of people would love to take the opportunity to travel back in time and see our younger selves, but Rian Johnson’s Looper takes this premise and adds a nasty twist. When a hit man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) realizes his latest quarry is his older self (Bruce Willis) — an event known among his peers as “closing the loop” — he muffs the job, allowing him(self) to escape and setting in motion a high-stakes pursuit that puts a widening circle of people in danger. Tense, funny, and surprisingly heartfelt, Looper may suffer from some of the same scientific story flaws as other time travel movies, but it also manages to turn its by-now-familiar basic ingredients into an uncommonly affecting and thought-provoking sci-fi drama. “Looper imagines a world just near enough to look familiar,” mused Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum, “and just futuristic enough to be chillingly askew.”Primer 72%Like any genre, science fiction has its share of clichés — and anything relating to time travel probably belongs on that list. But few films have ever dealt with time travel — or the many personal and ethical questions that could arise from ownership of the technology — with the level of intelligence that Shane Carruth’s ultra low-budget Primer brought to the table. The story of two garage scientists who accidentally build a time machine, Primer eschews whiz-bang special effects for a nuts-and-bolts look at the science behind the device, and a cold, hard look at how quickly and easily a friendship can be torn asunder by unchecked power and bottomless greed. It certainly isn’t for everyone — the reams of technical dialogue prompted critics such as the BBC’s Matthew Leyland to dismiss it as “one of the most willfully obscure sci-fi movies ever made” — but if you can absorb the material, it’s uncommonly gripping. Time Out’s Jessica Winter was appreciative, saying “this film imagines its viewers to be smart, possessed of a decent attention span and game for a challenge. It doesn’t happen all that often.”Somewhere in Time 61%Time travel has been used as a plot device to set up all kinds of stories, but rarely has it been employed with the sort of three-handkerchief weepie abandon brought to bear on 1980’s Somewhere in Time. Starring Christopher Reeve as a starry-eyed playwright accosted by a mysterious older woman who pleads with him to “come back to me” before pressing a locket into his hand and disappearing, Time slowly morphs into a fantastical tale about coming unmoored in time via self-hypnosis in order to be with the one you love — even if that love is inspired by a portrait of someone you don’t remember ever knowing. A divisive cult classic, Time has always been dismissed by less patient or romantically inclined viewers, but for others, it’s well worth watching. “Above all,” argued Apollo Guide’s Ryan Cracknell, “this film captures a romantic part of the imagination that is often left unexplored.”Star Trek IV – The Voyage Home 81%Having explored the outer limits of space, Star Trek spent much of its fourth cinematic installment in decidedly more familiar environs — namely, the America (specifically the San Francisco bay area) of 1986, thanks to a storyline, conceived by returning director Nimoy, that had the crew of the Enterprise traveling 600 years back in time to retrieve a humpback whale in order to… Well, it isn’t important, really; what mattered — at least to the folks who helped Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home to a $133 million worldwide gross — was that it lived up to Nimoy’s goal of showing audiences “a great time” with a feature that played up the lighter side of a franchise whose humor was often overshadowed by its big ideas. Weathering a number of pre-production storms — including William Shatner’s refusal to come back without a raise and the chance to direct the next sequel — Voyage triumphantly emerged as what Roger Ebert referred to as “easily the most absurd of the Star Trek stories — and yet, oddly enough… also the best, the funniest and the most enjoyable in simple human terms.”The Terminator 100%It was made with a fraction of the mega-budget gloss that enveloped its sequels, but for many, 1984’s The Terminator remains the pinnacle of the franchise — not to mention one of the most purely enjoyable movies of the last 30 years. Subsequent entries would get a little hard to follow, but the original’s premise was simple enough: A scary-looking cyborg (Schwarzenegger) travels back in time to kill a woman (Linda Hamilton) before she can give birth to the child who will grow up to lead the human resistance against an evil network of sentient machines. Tech noir at its most accessible, Terminator earned universal praise from critics such as Sean Axmaker of Turner Classic Movies, who wrote, “Gritty, clever, breathlessly paced, and dynamic despite the dark shadow of doom cast over the story, this sci-fi thriller remains one of the defining American films of the 1980s.”&nbsp;Time After Time 87%What if H.G. Wells really built a time machine — and what if Jack the Ripper used it to flee into the future? That’s the intriguing premise behind Nicholas Meyer’s Time After Time, starring Malcolm McDowell as Wells and David Warner as the killer. After Jack travels to 1979, Wells pursues him, setting in motion a cat-and-mouse thriller, culture-clash comedy, and love story all in one, with a dash of sharp social commentary thrown in for good measure. “Time After Time is still a fun fish-out-of-water flick that deserves more attention than it has received in the thirty years following its release,” wrote Simon Miraudo for Quickflix. “But there’s still plenty of time for that.”Time Bandits 90%Terry Gilliam and time travel: A match made in cinematic heaven. Years before he proved it for a second time with the much darker 12 Monkeys, Gilliam directed a far sillier — and visually dazzling — venture into the genre with 1981’s Time Bandits, uniting a stellar cast (including Shelley Duvall, John Cleese, Katherine Helmond, Ian Holm, and Sean Connery) in service of a deceptively thought-provoking caper about an 11-year-old history buff (Craig Warnock) on a journey through time with a group of dwarves. A solid critical and commercial hit, Bandits proved a favorite for writers like Roger Ebert, who pronounced it “amazingly well-produced” and applauded, “The historic locations are jammed with character and detail. This is the only live-action movie I’ve seen that literally looks like pages out of Heavy Metal magazine.”Timecop 45%In a career dotted with cult classics, 1994’s Timecop manages to stand out as one of the cultiest. And okay, so it’s hard to call a movie that raked in more than $100 million worldwide a “cult” picture — but if you’ve seen the way Timecop takes a cool premise (time travel, natch) and renders it both impenetrably complicated and irrelevant to the action, you know it’s essentially the very definition of the term. (Also, it stars Ron Silver.) The plot is full of holes, but as the filmmakers knew, once you accept the notion of Jean-Claude Van Damme as an officer of the Time Enforcement Commission, you can buy into pretty much anything, and by the time you get to Timecop‘s final act — in which past and future versions of Van Damme battle past and future versions of Silver — you’ve reached that wonderful place where the laws of logic no longer exist. The highest-grossing movie of Van Damme’s career, Timecop spun off a sequel, a short-lived television show, and even a series of books. Not bad for a movie that Roger Ebert described as “the kind of movie that is best not thought about at all, for that way madness lies.”&nbsp;The Time Machine 76%This isn’t the only time Hollywood’s tried adapting H.G. Wells’ classic story, but it’s definitely the best. Starring Rod Taylor as the Victorian time-traveling scientist George and featuring Oscar-winning special effects from Gene Warren and Tim Baar, director George Pal’s version of The Time Machine might seem somewhat quaint by today’s standards; still, whatever it lacks in modern-day visual pizzazz, it more than makes up in the stuff that matters — right down to Wells’ vision of a distant post-human future populated by docile creatures and the monstrous Morlocks who use them for food. It’s “Somewhat dated, and not quite up to the source material,” admitted Luke Y. Thompson of New Times, “but still some good retro fun.”12 Monkeys 89%Any time director Terry Gilliam manages to wrangle one of his films through the studio system, it’s a cause for celebration — and that goes double for a picture like 12 Monkeys, which almost seamlessly weds Gilliam’s signature flights of fancy with good old-fashioned commercialism to produce a knotty time travel story starring a pair of matinee idols (Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt) in an apocalyptic thriller that never stops asking questions — or forcing the audience to answer their own as they hustle to keep up with the unfolding drama. “There’s always overripe method to his madness,” observed Janet Maslin for the New York Times, “but in the new 12 Monkeys Mr. Gilliam’s methods are uncommonly wrenching and strong.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Noah‘s arrival signals the return of the old-fashioned Biblical epic, a type of movie that’s been mostly absent from theaters in recent decades, but whose unique blend of incredible scenery and high-stakes drama once ruled the box office — and we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to take a fond look back at some of the most notable entries from the genre. Repent, because it’s time for Total Recall!Ben-Hur 86%MGM billed it as “The Entertainment Experience of a Lifetime!,” and for once, a studio’s hubris was fairly well-founded: Ben-Hur not only improved upon the 1925 silent film that it remade, it did right by the 1880 Lew Wallace novel that inspired them both. Starring Charlton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur, it finds director William Wyler stuffing 212 minutes with a booming blend of Biblical imagery (including the Sermon on the Mount and the crucifixion of Jesus) and indelible action sequences (including the most famous chariot race in Hollywood history) — a potent mix that crushed all box office competitors during 1959, saving MGM from financial ruin and landing behind only Gone with the Wind on the list of the era’s all-time blockbusters. “It’s very much of its time, overblown and overlong,” admitted Film4’s Daniel Etherington, “but Ben-Hur is rightfully lodged at the forefront of Hollywood history.”&nbsp;David and Bathsheba 83%With Arizona standing in for the Holy Land and Gregory Peck making for a suitably noble King David, director Henry King (working from a screenplay by Philip Dunne) turned to the Book of Samuel for inspiration and emerged with David and Bathsheba. A stately reminder of the perils of the flesh, it sees Peck’s David falling hard for Bathsheba (Susan Hayward) — even though she’s already married to his soldier Uriah (Kieron Moore). A few sins later, David finds his land withering under a heavenly curse; fortunately for King and producer Darryl F. Zanuck, the movie suffered no such problems, topping the year-end box office grosses and picking up five Oscar nominations. Calling it “A reverential and sometimes majestic treatment of chronicles that have lived three millennia,” the New York Times cheered, “In concerning itself with an ageless romance, David and Bathsheba admirably achieves its goal.”&nbsp;Esther and the King 40%The flood of Biblical epics that baptized theaters in the 1950s was already starting to dry up by the time Esther and the King arrived in 1960, and this ill-received melodrama failed to do the genre any favors. Produced, directed, and co-written by Raoul Walsh, it’s chiefly memorable for starring a young Joan Collins as Esther (A Summer Place‘s Richard Egan played the King) — as well as being one of the last few films directed by Walsh during a distinguished 50-year career. The filmmaker’s resume didn’t improve Bosley Crowther’s mood while watching Esther and the King; “The best to be said for this chromo,” he later sighed, “is that it drives one more spike into the coffin of these synthetic biblical films.”&nbsp;King David 8%In critical and commercial terms, King David was essentially an unmitigated disaster, grossing a little over $5 million against a reported $21 million budget and provoking exasperated writeups from critics like Rich Cline, who sputtered “What were they thinking?,” and the Chicago Reader’s Dave Kehr, who described it as “stuffed with anonymous, identically bearded faces.” On the other hand, it does give you a chance to see Richard Gere complete his unlikely five-year journey from American Gigolo to Biblical hero. Where else can you do that?&nbsp;King of Kings 85%With Rip Torn as Judas and Orson Welles playing narrator, 1961’s King of Kings is worth watching if for no other reason than experiencing the talent assembled by director Nicholas Ray (Rebel Without a Cause). But this widescreen adaptation of the Gospels holds up fairly well in general, offering a surprisingly humanistic and subtle interpretation of the story, and led by a strong, layered performance from Jeffrey Hunter (widely derided at the time because of his teen-idol background) as Jesus. Nodded an appreciative David Parkinson for Empire, “Jeffrey Hunter is less Savior of the Christian faith and more anti-hero with many very human doubts and concerns.”The Passion of the Christ 49%Mel Gibson directing a movie about the painful final hours prior to Jesus’ crucifixion? In Aramaic? It isn’t hard to understand why many saw The Passion of the Christ as an enormous folly before it arrived in theaters, but speaking purely in commercial terms, Gibson had the last laugh — his Passion project grossed more than $370 million in the U.S. alone, in spite of largely mixed reviews and widespread concern that Gibson’s unflinching portrayal of Christ’s violent death was driven more by a love for gore than a love of the Lord. But for the devout, it proved a sometimes transcendent experience; as Peter T. Chattaway wrote for Christianity Today, “By giving us the feeling of experiencing Jesus’ thoughts, and by making us privy to his prayers, The Passion draws us toward Christ’s full humanity like no film before.”Quo Vadis 88%While not derived from Biblical verse, Quo Vadis takes place against the backdrop of early Christianity’s problems with the Roman Empire, and it’s certainly epic in scale, with director Mervyn LeRoy taking full advantage of MGM’s muscle to deliver one of the more visually opulent pictures on our list. Centered around the love story between a Christian woman (Deborah Kerr) and her conflicted Roman beau (Robert Taylor), it surrounds its swooning leads with an array of memorable set pieces, including pious converts being fed to lions and an upside-down crucifixion. Did LeRoy really need to take three hours to show it all? Perhaps not. But as Time Magazine argued, “For sheer size, opulence and technical razzle-dazzle, Quo Vadis is the year’s most impressive cinematic sight-seeing spree.”Salome 56%Recommended chiefly for curious film buffs, Alla Nazimova’s Salome put its star (who also produced) center stage in a deliberately over-the-top adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play loosely inspired by the Bible story about the tiff between Herodias (Rose Dione) and John the Baptist. As you’re probably well aware, things don’t end well for John, and neither did they for Salome: although it’s regarded today as one of the first “art” films made in the U.S. (and available for free streaming via the Internet Archive), it was an expensive, little-seen failure at the time, and periodic revivals have been greeted with equal parts enthusiasm and snark, with the Village Voice’s J. Hoberman once chuckling that the titular temptress’ famous dance amounted to “basically an absurd little gavotte” featuring “a squad of capering dwarfs.”&nbsp;Samson and Delilah 63%Remembered as the movie that inspired Sunday Times critic Dilys Powell to snark that the hero (played by Victor Mature) had larger breasts than his leading lady (Hedy Lamarr), Samson and Delilah found Cecil B. DeMille — who really did love his Biblical epics — bringing all of his gaudy DeMille-ness to bear on the tale of the ill-fated tryst between the titular couple, with typically florid results. You’ve seen better special effects (the fake lion Mature had to battle is particularly unfortunate), but woe be unto ye who pass up the opportunity to watch a gaggle of Philistines being whooped by one angry longhair with the jawbone of an ass. Just don’t expect too much; as Film4 lamented, “Most entertainment is gained from watching Mature going through the painful process of emoting, which is rather like watching an overlarge ham hock attempt to break out into a broad grin.”Sodom and Gomorrah 50%Sodom and Gomorrah director Robert Aldrich once said, “Every director ought to get one Biblical film out of his system, but there’s not very much that you can do about this sort of picture,” and he essentially proved himself right with this Franco-Italian-American co-production, which proved hugely popular in the U.K. but struggled to lure in audiences in the U.S. Starring Stewart Granger as the good-hearted Lot and Pier Angeli as his sodium-fated bride, it boasted the bloated budget and epic scope of any good Bible movie, but landed with little of the impact; calling it “an obvious but feeble imitation of The Ten Commandments,” the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther dismissed it by calling it “much more concerned with salt-mining than it is with debauchery or lust.”&nbsp;The Ten Commandments 88%When you think “Bible movies,” you probably think about Charlton Heston going full Moses in Cecil B. DeMille’s winsomely bombastic 1956 epic The Ten Commandments. It’s the Bible movie to end all Bible movies — almost literally, thanks to its three-hour-and-40-minute running time — but if it doesn’t always justify its immense sprawl and sheer over-the-topness, it comes pretty darn close. In fact, it’s become so closely identified with Old Testament fervor that a lot of people probably picture Heston when they think about Moses — and the movie itself is, as Steven D. Greydanus wrote for the Decent Films Guide, “As much a testament and a fixture of traditional American ideals and affections as a courthouse display of the stone tablets, and as weighty and solid.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

In honor of Cap’s return to theaters, we decided to spend this week’s list looking back at some other super second installments, so grab your vibranium shield — it’s time for Total Recall!&nbsp;The Dark Knight 94%Having already brought an end to the candy-colored, Schumacher-wrought nightmare that gripped the Batman franchise in the late 1990s, Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale had fans primed for a successful second act — but even after the smashing success of Batman Begins, few could have guessed just how popular The Dark Knight would be in the summer of 2008. A sprawling superhero epic that somehow managed to make room for jaw-dropping visuals, a compelling storyline, and stellar performances, Knight climbed out from under months of intense speculation — not to mention the shadow cast by Heath Ledger’s shocking death — with a worldwide gross in excess of $1 billion, a towering stack of positive reviews, and a posthumous Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Ledger. Richard Roeper joined the chorus of near-universal critical praise, calling it “a rich, complex, visually thrilling piece of pop entertainment, as strong as any superhero epic we’ve ever seen.”Spider-Man 2 93%Sam Raimi knew he was setting up a franchise with 2002’s Spider-Man, but still, following up that kind of success must have been daunting, especially given the studio’s immediate hunger for a sequel, not to mention a protracted search for a workable script which saw Raimi and the producers turning to a succession of writers — including Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, David Koepp, and Michael Chabon — before ultimately turning to Alvin Sargent, who stitched together the most workable elements of the previous drafts to come up with a story that centered on Spidey’s struggle to conquer his own self-doubt while battling Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina). It might sound like a piecemeal approach, but it worked; although Spider-Man 2 didn’t meet or exceed Spider-Man‘s global box office tally, it came close — and critics actually liked the second installment better than the first one, sending it all the way up to 93 percent on the Tomatometer on the strength of reviews from writers like Lou Lumenick, who wrote, “sequels don’t get much better — or smarter.” While touching on a dizzying array of storylines from the comics, Raimi and Sargent delivered a bigger, more intense version of the original that still managed to keep the action streamlined (and, of course, set up a third installment in the process).Superman II 86%After putting together what seemed like a foolproof plan for a speedy Superman follow-up — hiring director Richard Donner to shoot much of the sequel concurrently with the first film — Warner Bros. watched with growing dismay as production slowed to a crawl, finally coming to a halt when Donner’s feuds with producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind led to his firing from the project. Things grew more complicated when new director Richard Lester came on board, and — needing to film at least 51 percent of the movie in order to obtain a director’s credit — reshot many scenes from a movie that had already been substantially filmed. Those are just a few of the many challenges Superman II needed to overcome before it finally arrived in theaters in 1981; amazingly, all that behind-the-scenes chaos didn’t have much of an adverse impact on the original theatrical cut, which broke the $100 million barrier at the box office while enjoying almost as many positive reviews as its predecessor. It certainly helped that the screenplay gave Superman (Christopher Reeve) the most formidable villains he’d face in the original trilogy: Kryptonian criminals Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O’Halloran), sent into exile just before the planet’s destruction by Superman’s father Jor-El (Marlon Brando) and freed by the blast from a bomb Superman threw into space. Add in a subplot involving our hero opting to give up his powers in order to pursue domestic bliss with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), and it isn’t hard to see why many fans consider this the best of the Reeve-era Superman movies (or why enough of them clamored for the release of Donner’s cut that it finally saw the official light of day in 2006). “Superman II,” sighed an appreciative Janet Maslin for the New York Times, “is a marvelous toy.”X2: X-Men United 85%Given the long odds it faced just getting to the screen, let alone pulling off the transition so successfully, it seemed altogether unlikely that X-Men‘s inevitable sequel would be able to achieve the same standard, let alone exceed it — but that’s exactly what 2003’s X2: X-Men United did, both at the box office, where it grossed over $400 million, and among critics, who praised it even more highly than its predecessor. This was, appropriately, accomplished two ways: One, the screenplay satisfied critics and longtime fans by tackling the comic’s long-running sociological themes, most explicitly the fear of “outside” elements (in this case, sexy super-powered mutants) and how that fear is channeled by xenophobic authority figures; two, the sequel ramped up the original’s gee-whiz factor by introducing characters like the teleporting, prehensile-tailed Nightcrawler — and daring to tease at the Marvel title’s Phoenix storyline, one of the most beloved, brain-bending plots in the publisher’s history. The result was a film that remains both a fan favorite and a critical benchmark for writers like Variety’s Todd McCarthy, who lauded X2 as “bigger and more ambitious in every respect, from its action and visceral qualities to its themes.”&nbsp;Hellboy II: The Golden Army 86%Four years after the first installment, star Ron “Hellboy” Perlman teamed up again with director Guillermo del Toro for another round of supernatural fun — and while the original Hellboy earned mostly positive reviews, the sequel was an even bigger critical winner. A gleeful blend of popcorn thrills and uniquely del Toro visual splendor, Hellboy II: The Golden Army reunited the original cast for an epic battle between the forces of good and an irate elven king (Luke Goss) who wants to reignite the long-dormant war between elves and humans. While it was overshadowed at the box office by The Dark Knight and Iron Man, it still earned over $160 million — and earned the admiration of critics like Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, who called it “the biggest, richest, most imaginative superhero movie of the summer.”Batman Returns 80%Though initially reluctant to film a sequel to 1989’s Batman, director Tim Burton was eventually persuaded to return to Gotham after wresting complete creative control from Warner Bros. and hiring Daniel Waters (who worked with Burton on an attempted Beetlejuice sequel) to write the script. The result was 1992’s Batman Returns, a casting dream that found Batman (Michael Keaton, donning the cowl for the final time) facing off against Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer, resplendent in leather) and the Penguin (a scenery-chewing Danny DeVito). Though some critics (and parents) felt the film was too dark, most reviews were positive; in fact, before Christopher Nolan came along with Batman Begins, Batman Returns was the best-reviewed film in the franchise, something Desson Thompson of the Washington Post attributed to the fact that it “Comes closer than ever to Bob Kane’s dark, original strip, which began in 1939.”Iron Man 2 72%When your franchise is blessed with a leading man as charismatic (and as effortlessly well-suited to the role) as Robert Downey, Jr., you can cover up a lot of problems with your script simply by aiming the cameras at your star and letting him do what he does best. Perfect case in point: Iron Man 2, which managed to serve up a fair amount of Downey-derived fun in spite of a workmanlike plot that seemed to actively try and tamp down the many colorful possibilities inherent in a plot pitting our hero against Mickey Rourke as a half-mad Russian who uses the technology behind Iron Man’s armor to try and destroy him. Fortunately for the franchise, even lukewarm Iron Man was good enough for nearly $625 million in global grosses, as well as praise from most critics. “There are too many new characters, too many crossing story lines, not enough romance and our hero’s a smug jerk for the first half hour,” shrugged Tom Long of the Detroit News. “Who cares? Iron Man 2 still rocks.”Thor: The Dark World 66%When Thor (Chris Hemsworth) left Earth to return to Asgard at the end of his first big-screen adventure, he was eager to return for Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) — but he had to have been hoping for cheerier circumstances than the ones the couple faced in Thor: The Dark World, which found the hammier-wielding hero making his way back as part of an epic battle against the nefarious Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), ruler of the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim, who’s on a quest to destroy the universe using a mystical weapon dubbed the Aether. With prophecies, ancient artifacts, galaxy-spanning war, and another dose of the ever-charming Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Dark World managed to woo most critics even if it didn’t quite reach the celestial heights of the first installment. “Comic-book superheroes have become so angst-ridden in recent years,” lamented the Sydney Morning Herald’s Sydney Hall. “It’s a relief to be around one who has hung on to his sense of humor.”Blade II 57%It’s a late-period Wesley Snipes movie and the sequel to a vampire flick, but don’t dismiss 2002’s Blade II out of hand; for starters, the second installment of New Line’s Blade franchise brought in Guillermo del Toro to take over for original director Stephen Norrington, lending the sequel more smarts and visual flair than you might otherwise expect from a film including a scene that takes place in a vampire nightclub. Though the plot is bogged down with more double-crosses than a bad heist movie (and giggle-worthy stuff like UV grenades), screenwriter David S. Goyer was smart enough to include plenty of action — and to set up a third installment in the epilogue. At 59 percent on the Tomatometer, Blade II ain’t exactly Citizen Kane, but it’s the best-reviewed of the Blade trilogy, and its $150 million worldwide gross makes it the most financially successful, too — something several critics attributed to the change in director. “If you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore,” wrote the Denver Post’s Steven Rosen, “you’ll see Del Toro has brought unexpected gravity to Blade II.”&nbsp;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer 37%In a way, Tim Story had it better than either Sam Raimi or Bryan Singer while making the Fantastic Four sequel, Rise of the Silver Surfer — where both of those directors had to contend with the weight of crushing expectations, both from fans of the comics they were adapting and moviegoers who enjoyed the earlier installments of their respective franchises, Story was blessed with the opportunity to follow up a film that people turned to for mindless summer entertainment in spite of all the critical enmity it earned. With the bar set relatively low, Story and his cast were free to improve upon the first Fantastic without suffering undue scrutiny. And improve upon it they did, if only slightly; Rise of the Silver Surfer‘s Tomatometer, while still Rotten, inched a few notches higher than the original film’s, and although its box office total fell roughly $40 million short of Fantastic Four‘s $330 million, it still generated a pretty hefty pile of dough. For all that, however, Rise of the Silver Surfer nonetheless went down as a missed opportunity — to turn Fantastic Four into a viable franchise, to provide a launchpad for a spinoff starring one of Marvel’s most unique (and let’s face it, downright silly) characters, the Silver Surfer, and most of all, to entertain critics like Scott Brown of Entertainment Weekly, who sighed, “if you swept the cosmic dust of the superhero boom into a flimsy dustpan, you’d have the Fantastic Four franchise.”Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance 18%On paper, one might assume that an injection of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor’s cracked action aesthetic would be exactly what a Ghost Rider sequel needed, with their gleefully lurid style providing a perfect complement to Nicolas Cage’s marvelous knack for playing characters embroiled in over-the-top situations like being saddled with the curse of owing one’s soul to a vengeful demon. Alas and alack, the reality of Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance proved to be far less compelling than the theory, and although the movie’s $132 million global box office demonstrated how little audiences cared what critics thought about movies featuring central characters who roared around on motorcycles with their heads on fire, reviews were even worse than they’d been for the first Ghost Rider, and hopes for a trilogy were abandoned when Sony let the rights to the character revert back to Marvel. Still, for a handful of critics, Spirit of Vengeance was a disposably good time; as Ken Hanke wrote for the Asheville Mountain Xpress, “It was exactly what I expected it to be, and I was fine with that.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

But looking to take creative control of his own career, he and partner-in-crime Ben Affleck wrote Good Will Hunting, earning the two a Best Original Screenplay Oscar, and an acting nom for Damon. After that, it was off to the races, working with the likes of Steven Spielberg (Saving Private Ryan), Kevin Smith (Dogma, though he already had a previous cameo in Chasing Amy), Anthony Minghella (The Talented Mr. Ripley), and Martin Scorsese (The Departed).Damon worked with Gus Van Sant a few more times (Finding Forrester, Gerry) before finding a truly kindred creative partner in Steven Soderbergh. Together, along with another regular cast of collaborators, he’s starred in three Ocean’s movies, Contagion, The Informant!, and Behind the Candelabra, with small cameos in Soderbergh’s Che Guevara biopics. Around the same time as Ocean’s Eleven, Damon came into the Bourne series, whose first trilogy (Identity, Supremacy, and Ultimatum) would rewrite the book on action cinema in the 21st century, with its intimate shaky-cam presentation and intricate plotting and character work.The 2010s were a big decade for science-fiction and Damon got in on the action, with work representing some of his best movies, and certainly among the most well-known: The Adjustment Bureau, Elysium, The Zero Theorem, Interstellar, and The Martian.After a rough 2017 where he starred in only Rotten movies (The Great Wall, Suburbicon, Downsizing), and remaining off-screen for 2018, he’s making a late 2019 appearance with Ford v Ferrari, the high-octane true story co-starring Christian Bale, and directed by James Mangold.

He gets his chance this weekend, as the already well-reviewed Rush (currently playing in Europe and in limited U.S. release) expands nationwide with the fact-based tale of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl), 1970s racing stars whose rivalry proved memorably entertaining on as well as off the course. Of course, this isn’t Howard’s first trip around the track, so we decided to dedicate this week’s list to a rundown of some of the brighter critical highlights from a career full of crowd-pleasers. Goodbye gray sky, hello blue — it’s time for Total Recall! 75%10. RansomHoward isn’t exactly known for his way with a pulse-pounding thriller, but nobody blends action with soul-curdling anguish quite like Mel Gibson, and with 1996’s Ransom, Howard brought him a role he was more or less born to play: Tom Mullen, a wealthy man with an anger management problem and some skeletons rattling around in his closet. Mullen’s past sins come back to haunt him when a group of kidnappers, seeking a $2 million ransom, kidnap his young son — but because this is a Mel Gibson movie, rather than simply forking over the money, Mullen ends up turning the tables in a brutally high-stakes game, going on television and offering an equal amount of money to anyone who can bring his tormentors to justice. “Ransom is dark and risky in a way that’s become almost unthinkable for mainstream movies in the ’90s,” opined Salon’s Charles Taylor. “It doesn’t resolve its conflicts or allow the audience triumph or release. In the guise of a thriller, Howard made a serious examination of the ambiguity of power.” 74%9. A Beautiful MindOnly a year after scoring his Best Actor Academy Award for Gladiator, Russell Crowe resurfaced on Oscar ballots for his work in Howard’s A Beautiful Mind, which dramatized the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a Nobel-winning economist whose struggles with schizophrenia have darkened a remarkable life. Though its historical accuracy was questioned, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman was accused of cherry-picking details from Nash’s life to make him a more sympathetic character, the result was still a film that grossed more than $300 million and earned four Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director, as well as another Best Actor nomination for Crowe). As Bob Bloom of Lafayette Journal and Courier wrote, “A brilliant performance by Russell Crowe, who takes his audience on a terrifying journey inside a man tormented by self-created mental demons, propels A Beautiful Mind.” 79%8. CocoonRound up a group of wily old acting pros like Don Ameche, Maureen Stapleton, Wilford Brimley, Jessica Tandy, and Hume Cronyn, and you can have them do pretty much any old thing and make it well worth watching — even if the script in question is a gauzily sentimental sci-fi dramedy about senior citizens accidentally stumbling across a batch of age-reversing alien pods while Steve Guttenberg does his uniquely 1980s Guttenberg thing. The threat of heartstring-tugging sap was high with Cocoon, but screenwriter Tom Benedek (working from David Saperstein’s novel) treated his characters with dignity, and Howard’s direction left plenty of room for the cast to carry the movie with remarkably deft performances that managed to be funny, thought-provoking, and heartbreakingly poignant — sometimes within the same scene. “Mr. Howard brings a real sweetness to his subject, as does the film’s fine cast of veteran stars; he has also given Cocoon the bright, expansive look of a hot-weather hit,” wrote Janet Maslin for the New York Times. “And even when the film begins to falter, as it does in its latter sections, Mr. Howard’s touch remains reasonably steady.” 80%7. Cinderella ManOne good biopic deserves another, so A Beautiful Mind teammates Ron Howard and Russell Crowe reunited four years later for another life story — the tale of Depression-era heavyweight champion James J. Braddock, who was dubbed “The Cinderella Man” even before he overcame 10-to-1 odds and defeated Max Baer to claim his title. Surrounded by a top-shelf cast that included Renee Zellweger, Paddy Considine, and Paul Giamatti (who received one of the film’s three Oscar nominations), Crowe embodied both the raw physicality and the inner struggle of a fighter who risked his health, and his marriage, to stay in the ring. Though Cinderella Man wasn’t a Beautiful Mind-sized hit, it did break the $100 million mark — and it earned the admiration of most critics, including Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, who wrote, “How exceptional a film actor is Russell Crowe? So exceptional that in Cinderella Man, he makes a good boxing movie feel at times like a great, big picture.” 88%6. The PaperHoward reunited with his Night Shift star, Michael Keaton, for a very different kind of project in 1994: The Paper, an ensemble dramedy about the frantic goings-on behind the scenes during 24 hours in the life of a New York City newspaper. While things have changed drastically for the publishing industry in the years since The Paper‘s release, rendering the movie’s backdrop rather quaint, the sharp writing (from brothers David and Stephen Koepp) and rock-solid acting — rounded out by a showy cast that also included Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Jason Robards, and Marisa Tomei — are timeless. “Howard, after stumbling with Far and Away, is back in form, and perhaps at the top of his game,” enthused Chris Hicks for the Deseret News. “There are times when the sheer size of the film seems enough to throw it off the track, but Howard manages, for the most part, to keep things rolling along in his usual slick, if sometimes obvious fashion.” 91%5. SplashStarring in a frothy romantic comedy as a man who falls in love with a mermaid may not seem like the surest path to starting a film career, but then, 1984’s Splash was no ordinary movie — in fact, it started a lot of things, among them an entire studio (Touchstone Pictures, created to allow Disney the ability to release more “adult” fare without sullying its name brand), a surge in the number of girls named Madison, and, supposedly, a name change for the Disneyland ride that eventually became Splash Mountain. Not bad for a movie featuring a pair of largely untested stars (Hanks was fresh from Bosom Buddies, and Hannah was known mainly for her role in Blade Runner) and a director most people still thought of as Opie Taylor (or Richie Cunningham). Nearly $70 million in domestic receipts (and one Academy Award nomination) later, and all three were on their way to bigger and brighter things, thanks in part to positive critical buzz that has proven surprisingly durable; recently, Empire’s Ian Freer held it up as “the movie that really showed Tom Hanks’ promise as a deliverer of great comedy and heart-warming pathos.” 91%4. ParenthoodTen years after redefining doofus comedy with 1979’s The Jerk, Steve Martin had (mostly) traded in props and pratfalls — and he cemented his more reflective, mature on-screen persona with his appearance as sensitive dad Gil Buckman in Ron Howard’s Parenthood. Blending comedy and drama with crowded casts was trendy for a time in the late 1980s (thirtysomething, anyone?), and there are few better examples of the “dramedy” subgenre than this tender, witty look at the tangled bonds between parents and their kids; Parenthood was greeted with a wave of glowing reviews upon its release, many of them reserving their highest praise for the uncommon dexterity with which the story (written by Howard, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel) jumps between its numerous threads. As Rolling Stone’s Peter Travers pointed out, “It’s a shock, and a welcome one, to see Steve Martin cast against type as a doting dad. Martin’s nippy wit continually lifts this movie above the swamp of sentiment.” 93%3. Frost/NixonHoward earned some of the better reviews of his career for 2009’s Frost/Nixon, which adapts the Peter Morgan play that dramatized British broadcaster David Frost’s (played by Michael Sheen) efforts to secure and sell a series of TV interviews with the politically exiled former president (portrayed by Frank Langella). Although plenty of pundits took umbrage at the way Morgan’s screenplay took liberties with the actual events that inspired the film, for the vast majority of critics, Frost/Nixon‘s flaws seemed pretty minor when weighed against the script, direction, editing, completed picture, and Langella’s performance — all of which received Oscar nominations. For the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Steven Rea, it all added up to “A must-see for political junkies, history buffs, and folks still fascinated by the paranoia-fueled follies of the twitchy, sweaty, decidedly uncharismatic 37th president.” 92%2. Night ShiftHoward could have been accused of tempting fate when he elected to direct his Happy Days buddy Henry Winkler in 1982’s Night Shift — a particularly risky move considering that in the movie, Winkler shed his Fonzie cool to play the nebbishy Chuck Lumley, a newly hired morgue attendant who finds himself going against his better judgment to participate in the cockamamie schemes hatched by his fast-talking co-worker Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) and ends up becoming the de facto co-manager of a thoroughly unusual brothel hosted by a free-spirited hooker (Shelley Long). Ralph Malph was nowhere in sight, in other words, but there was plenty of sitting on it going on — and loads of critical praise, including a positive review from Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, who wrote, “This isn’t as snappily directed or as caustically conceived as the subsequent Risky Business, which has a similar theme, but it’s arguably just as sexy and almost as funny.” 96%1. Apollo 13Splash buddies Tom Hanks and Ron Howard reunited for 1995’s Apollo 13, a dramatization of NASA’s aborted 1970 lunar mission that combined one of Hanks’ biggest personal passions — space travel — with Hollywood’s favorite thing: a blockbuster prestige picture. With a cast that featured a number of similarly prolific actors (among them Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, and Hanks’ Forrest Gump costar Gary Sinise), Apollo probably would have made decent money even if it had played fast and loose with the real-life details of the launch, but Howard and his crew strove for verisimilitude, going so far as to shoot portions of the film in actual zero gravity. The result was a summertime smash that restored some of space travel’s luster for a jaded generation — and made for an exceedingly good filmgoing experience according to most critics, including Roger Ebert, who called it “a powerful story, one of the year’s best films, told with great clarity and remarkable technical detail, and acted without pumped-up histrionics.”In case you were wondering, here are Howard’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. A Beautiful Mind — 90%2. Cinderella Man — 87%3. Frost/Nixon — 86%4. Apollo 13 — 80%5. Willow — 74%6. Backdraft — 72%7. Parenthood — 68%8. Angels &amp; Demons — 62%9. The Da Vinci Code — 61%10.

The theater director who caught them offered them parts in a play instead of calling the police, and Diesel’s career in the arts began.Diesel initially had a tough go in the industry as a young, aspiring actor, until he poured his frustrations into a short film that he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in, called&nbsp;Multi-Facial. It was good enough to get the attention of none other than Steven Spielberg, who brought him on board his multiple Academy Award-winning&nbsp;Saving Private Ryan. After Diesel then provided the voice for Brad Bird’s sentimental winner&nbsp;The Iron Giant, he embarked on what would be a career-defining journey as one of contemporary cinema’s most recognizable action franchise stars.It began with 2000’s&nbsp;Pitch Black, which kicked off the Chronicles of Riddick franchise, and continued with 2001’s&nbsp;The Fast and the Furious and 2002’s xXx, one of&nbsp;which, of course, has become one of the most successful film series ever and is still going strong, with new entries on the way.&nbsp;(Hint: it’s not&nbsp;xXx.) If all of that weren’t enough, it was also Diesel’s presence as the voice of a living tree that only utters one phrase in a goofy superheroes-in-space movie that helped make&nbsp;Groot — and subequently Baby Groot —&nbsp;one of the most beloved characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.After all of this, Diesel is still looking for more franchises to sink his teeth into, and the upcoming release of&nbsp;Bloodshot, an adaptation of the Valiant Comics series of the same name, could be the one.

A case in point: Matt Dillon, who suffered his share of professional setbacks after rising to glowering fame in films such as The Outsiders and Rumble Fish, only to re-emerge at the end of the 1980s as a versatile actor with dramatic depth (Drugstore Cowboy) to match his gift for comedy (There’s Something About Mary). With Dillon appearing in Sunlight Jr. this weekend, we thought now would be a great time to revisit some of his many critical highlights. It’s time for Total Recall! 80%10. The Saint of Fort WashingtonIt can be tricky for a filmmaker to split the difference between “socially conscious” and “heavy-handed,” but with 1993’s The Saint of Fort Washington, director Tim Hunter managed to stay mostly on the right side of the line while telling the story of a schizophrenic man (Dillon) who’s turned out onto the streets after the tenement where he’s been sleeping is torn down. Beset by local bullies, he finds himself in desperate need of a friend — and finds one in a homeless veteran (Danny Glover) who helps him adjust to life on his own. “Whatever its shortcomings,” argued Janet Maslin for the New York Times, “The Saint of Fort Washington takes its subject very seriously, in ways that no audience can fail to find wrenchingly sad.” 79%9. Beautiful GirlsWith Ted Demme behind the cameras, a script by Scott Rosenberg (High Fidelity), and a stellar ensemble cast that included Dillon, Uma Thurman, Natalie Portman, Mira Sorvino, and Timothy Hutton, how did Beautiful Girls end up grossing less than $11 million at the box office? Chalk it up to another of life’s mysteries, but don’t miss this tenderly drawn portrait of a group of friends grappling with the twilight of their 20s in a small Midwestern town. Though critics were quick to point out that dialogue-heavy films about maturity-fearing young adults weren’t exactly novel, particularly during the mid-1990s, most reviews echoed the sentiments of Empire’s Darren Bignell, who wrote, “This film really succeeds with its warm treatment of ordinary hang-ups — no life-shattering revelations or pain repressed since childhood, just the genuine, everyday trials of life.” 79%8. SinglesDillon celebrated the flannelriffic early 1990s by growing his hair out and sporting a soul patch for Cameron Crowe’s Singles, a Seattle-set, grunge-fueled look at the romantic entanglements of a group of Seattle twentysomethings. (If it sounds like a West Coast version of a certain long-running sitcom, there’s a reason: NBC’s foiled attempt to turn Singles into a series resulted in Friends.) Here, Dillon plays Cliff Poncier, the brooding frontman of Seattle band Citizen Dick (played by future members of Pearl Jam), whose relationship with Bridget Fonda’s character acts as a counterpoint to the commitment struggles of another couple (played by Kyra Sedgwick and Campbell Scott). Released just as grunge artists were really starting to dominate the charts, Singles was more of a soundtrack phenomenon than a box office hit, but it found favor with most critics — including Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal, who wrote, “Brilliant dialogue, killer musical cues and hilarious comic beats. It made me happy, it made me cry… Right movie, right time.” 85%7. TexDillon followed his turn as the unctuous bully in My Bodyguard with the title role in Tim Hunter’s adaptation of the S.E. Hinton novel Tex — a character described in the synopsis as “sweet” and “slightly dim.” Critics were also pretty sweet on this Disney-distributed coming-of-age story, which follows the young McCormick brothers (played by Dillon and Jim Metzler) as they struggle to move on with their lives following the death of their mother and their abandonment by their father; as Roger Ebert summed it up in his review, “There is a shock of recognition almost from the beginning of Tex, because we’re listening to the sound of American voices in an authentically American world.” 83%6. There’s Something About MaryMatt Dillon isn’t generally known for his comedic skills, but with There’s Something About Mary, he proved he could hold his own against a cast of funny people that included Ben Stiller, Chris Elliott, Sarah Silverman, and Jeffrey Tambor. Spending a great deal of the film in garishly capped teeth — and serving as the centerpiece of some of the movie’s most uncomfortably uproarious bits — Dillon helped send the Farrelly brothers’ cinematic coming-out party to a $369 million worldwide gross, and was a healthy part of why Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times deemed it “a giddy symphony of rude and raucous low humor.” 84%5. My Bodyguard“Terrorized in the toilet? Chased after school? Shaken down for your lunch money? GET A BODYGUARD!” This was the advice offered by the poster for 1980’s My Bodyguard, which starred Dillon as the loathsome bully Melvin Moody, whose constant torment drives hapless outcast Clifford Peache (Chris Makepeace) to hire a protector (played by Adam Baldwin). In a decade filled with half-baked teen flicks, this had the potential to be some pretty uninspired stuff, but Bodyguard actually ended up being one of the year’s biggest hits, both at the box office and with critics. It’s “A sweet little movie about characters who really seem to be people,” according to Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who noted that — then as well as now — “that sort of verisimilitude is rarer than it ought to be nowadays.” 88%4. To Die ForDillon reunited with Drugstore Cowboy director Gus Van Sant for 1995’s To Die For, a black comedy starring Nicole Kidman as a sociopath who uses her wiles to convince a high school student (Joaquin Phoenix) to murder her husband (played by Dillon). While it wasn’t a major commercial success, Die resonated strongly with critics, proved Kidman’s versatility, and cemented the career comeback Dillon started in the late 1980s. “If you’ve hitherto failed to respond to the laid-back oddball appeal of Van Sant’s movies, fear not,” wrote Geoff Andrew for Time Out, calling the film “a sharp, consistently funny blend of black comedy and satire on the deleterious effects of television.” 83%3. The Flamingo KidDillon followed up his roles in the S.E. Hinton trilogy (Tex, Rumble Fish, and The Outsiders) with the lead in Garry Marshall’s The Flamingo Kid, a coming-of-age comedy about a Brooklyn teen whose summer job at an exclusive Long Island beach resort leads to the requisite life lessons (as well as some of the first PG-13 T&amp;A). Though critics were less than impressed with Marshall’s slick direction (Andre Sennwald of the New York Times said it came “out of sitcom country”), they found favor with the script, not to mention Dillon and Richard Crenna’s performances. As Erik Childress of the Apollo Guide put it, “The Flamingo Kid is one of those rare films that follows a traditional method of coming-of-age storytelling and then shakes it up by not dealing us mere caricatures and stereotypes.” 83%2. Over the EdgeAlthough it didn’t make much of a dent in theaters during its limited run, 1979’s Over the Edge is notable for a few reasons, not the least of which is the fact that it marks the big-screen debut of a 14-year-old Matt Dillon. One of the decade’s more sensitively constructed looks at suburban teen angst, Edge focuses on a group of kids chafing under the restrictions of life in their community while heading for a fateful confrontation with local law enforcement. Observed the Chicago Reader’s Dave Kehr, “Director Jonathan Kaplan has a fine feel for the crushing blandness of ‘planned communities’ — the anger that possesses his underage heroes proceeds from a physically oppressive emptiness, represented by rows of hollow townhouses and vast, blasted fields.” 100%1. Drugstore CowboyDillon’s career cooled considerably during the mid-to-late 1980s, but he continued to work steadily — and he continued to improve as an actor, too, as evidenced by his stellar work in 1989’s Drugstore Cowboy. Adapted by James Yost, William S. Burroughs, and director Gus Van Sant from James Fogle’s autobiographical novel, Cowboy follows the adventures of Bob Hughes (Dillon), the leader of a crew of drug-addicted bandits who support their habit by robbing pharmacies. A gritty, darkly comic tale of squandered potential, soul-shattering loss, and the elusiveness of redemption, the movie earned Dillon an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actor — and critical praise from scribes such as Desson Thomson of the Washington Post, who wrote, “Ultimately it’s Dillon who has the biggest score; he makes this stark trip a heady, hopeful one.”In case you were wondering, here are Dillon’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Crash — 87%2. Drugstore Cowboy — 82%3. The Outsiders — 79%4. Over the Edge — 79%5. Beautiful Girls — 77%6. Rumble Fish — 76%7. Grace of My Heart — 73%8. Singles — 70%9. My Bodyguard — 66%10.

It's a plane! It's the Man of Steel on the big screen!by RT Staff | June 13, 2013 |  CommentsIt took a heck of a lot longer than a speeding bullet to get here, but when Man of Steel arrives in theaters this week, it’ll herald the return of a beloved franchise that — although not without its share of ups and downs — has been thrilling fans for decades. In fact, this year marks the 62nd anniversary of the first Superman movie, Superman and the Mole Men; sadly, we don’t have any reviews on file for that one, but that didn’t stop us from taking a look back at our hero’s other big-screen adventures. From the moments that made us believe a man could fly to the ones that were critical Kryptonite, this week is all about Krypton’s favorite son. Up, up, and away, it’s time for Total Recall!Superman 94%“You’ll believe a man can fly,” promised the posters for 1978’s Superman, and they were right in more ways than one. The special effects were impressive for the era, but more importantly, the movie benefited from a talented director in Richard Donner, a solid screenplay derived from a story by Godfather author Mario Puzo, and a great cast anchored by Christopher Reeve, whose looming physique and chiseled good looks combined with his Juilliard-trained acting chops to help create the most perfect Superman ever to grace the screen (so far). While Gene Hackman’s rather ineffective Lex Luthor (coupled with the buffoonish Otis, played by Ned Beatty) was far from the most imposing foe our hero would face, the movie didn’t lack for dramatic stakes — and with Margot Kidder playing Lois Lane, it even managed to mix a little feminism in with its romance. “The audience finds itself pleasantly surprised, and taken a little off guard,” observed an appreciative Roger Ebert. “The movie’s tremendously exciting in a comic book sort of way (kids will go ape for it), but at the same time it has a sly sophistication, a kidding insight into the material, that makes it, amazingly, a refreshingly offbeat comedy.”Superman II 86%After putting together what seemed like a foolproof plan for a speedy Superman follow-up — hiring director Richard Donner to shoot much of the sequel concurrently with the first film — Warner Bros. watched with growing dismay as production slowed to a crawl, finally coming to a halt when Donner’s feuds with producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind led to his firing from the project. Things grew more complicated when new director Richard Lester came on board, and — needing to film at least 51 percent of the movie in order to obtain a director’s credit — reshot many scenes from a movie that had already been substantially filmed. Those are just a few of the many challenges Superman II needed to overcome before it finally arrived in theaters in 1981; amazingly, all that behind-the-scenes chaos didn’t have much of an adverse impact on the original theatrical cut, which broke the $100 million barrier at the box office while enjoying almost as many positive reviews as its predecessor. It certainly helped that the screenplay gave Superman (Christopher Reeve) the most formidable villains he’d face in the original trilogy: Kryptonian criminals Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O’Halloran), sent into exile just before the planet’s destruction by Superman’s father Jor-El (Marlon Brando) and freed by the blast from a bomb Superman threw into space. Add in a subplot involving our hero opting to give up his powers in order to pursue domestic bliss with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), and it isn’t hard to see why many fans consider this the best of the Reeve-era Superman movies (or why enough of them clamored for the release of Donner’s cut that it finally saw the official light of day in 2006). “Superman II,” sighed an appreciative Janet Maslin for the New York Times, “is a marvelous toy.”Superman III 30%The first two Superman movies boasted an impressive narrative scope, state-of-the-art special effects, and layered performances that made it possible for the story to move gracefully between action, drama, and comedy, sometimes within the space of a single scene. They were a tough act to follow, in other words — which might explain why 1983’s Superman III didn’t really bother attempting to build on their success, instead opting to take the franchise in an altogether sillier direction by pitting the Man of Steel against a power-mad CEO (Robert Vaughn) who blackmails an unscrupulous computer programmer (Richard Pryor) into using his know-how to help him achieve world domination. Aside from the typically techno-ignorant screenplay, which imagines weather satellites capable of creating tornados and supercomputers that achieve sentience after being attacked with an axe, III earned fans’ and critics’ ire by ignoring any semblance of character development in favor of director Richard Lester’s fondness for oddball humor and silly sight gags. Under different circumstances, Pryor could have been a worthy addition to a Superman movie — and the storyline, which sent Clark Kent back to Smallville for a high school reunion that reconnected him with childhood crush Lana Lang (Annette O’Toole), certainly had possibilities, as did a subplot that found Superman’s personality slowly being altered due to artificial Kryptonite poisoning. Ultimately, however, Superman III was less than the sum of its parts; as a disappointed Roger Ebert put it, “It’s a cinematic comic book, shallow, silly, filled with stunts and action, without much human interest.”Superman IV: The Quest for Peace 11%With Gene Hackman back in the cast and a four-year break to cleanse filmgoers’ palates after the unpleasantness of Superman III, 1987’s Superman IV: The Quest for Peace seemed to have everything going for it at first — including a smartly topical storyline that put the Man of Steel in the middle of the Cold War (and doing battle with a nuclear-powered Superclone designed by Lex Luthor). Unfortunately, when money started to run tight at Cannon Films, director Sidney J. Furie found himself forced to cut corners in every direction; the result, according to most critics, was a disjointed, cheap-looking mess, further hampered by dejected-seeming performances from a cast that appeared to know exactly how much of a mistake they were making. (In fact, Jon Cryer — who played Luthor’s nephew Lenny — alleges that Christopher Reeve told him the movie was “an absolute mess.”) It all added up to the original trilogy’s critical and commercial nadir, a dud so resounding that it sent the franchise into limbo for nearly 20 years. Calling it “More sluggish than a funeral barge, cheaper than a sale at K mart,” the Washington Post’s Desson Thomson warned, “it’s a nerd, it’s a shame, it’s Superman IV.”Superman Returns 75%If you’re any kind of film buff, you’re already familiar with many of the twists and turns that Superman endured at Warner Bros. during the 1980s and 1990s — heck, they’ve even inspired their own documentary — so suffice it to say that after Superman IV tanked, the franchise was more or less frozen at a crossroads for years. Talk of another Reeve-led sequel stopped after the 1995 horse riding accident that left him paralyzed, and despite the best efforts of a long succession of screenwriters, directors, and would-be stars, our Kryptonian hero spent the better part of 20 years waiting for a hero of his own to rescue him from development hell. Help finally arrived in the form of director Bryan Singer, who was handed the keys to the franchise after proving his superhero mettle with X-Men and its first sequel; in the summer of 2006, Superman Returns rebooted the story, with newcomer Brandon Routh wearing the cape, Kate Bosworth playing Lois Lane, and Kevin Spacey chewing up the scenery as Lex Luthor. Despite solid reviews, a $200 million gross, and a properly reverent tone — including a storyline that paid homage to the first two Superman movies while pretending the missteps of III and IV never happened — Superman Returns was ultimately regarded as something of a disappointment; plans for a sequel never materialized, much to the chagrin of the AP’s Christy Lemire, who wondered, “Does the world really need Superman? Maybe not everyone. But people who love movies do.”In case you were wondering, here are Wilson’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Superman — 77%2. Superman Returns — 67%3.

One of those projects, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, is arriving in theaters this weekend, so we decided now would be the perfect time to take an appreciative look back at some of her most critically successful cinematic efforts. From quiet British dramas to Disney flicks and horror films, Lena’s done a lot — and it doesn’t look like she’ll be slowing down anytime soon. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the finest bits of her filmography here! 48%10. OneginOne person’s sumptuously acted period romance is another person’s glacially paced snoozer — and so it is with Onegin, first-time director Martha Fiennes’ adaptation of the 1833 Russian novel about an arrogant dandy (Ralph Fiennes) whose rather careless treatment of two sisters (played by Headey and Liv Tyler) puts him at fateful odds with his friend (Toby Stephens). While Onegin was warmly received by critics on the global stage, earning a BAFTA nomination for Best Picture, the majority of American scribes found it too slow and mannered to breathe life into the book’s deliberate drama — although it did have its defenders, including Combustible Celluloid’s Jeffrey M. Anderson, who wrote, “Overall, Onegin is a bit of a sloppy and untidy affair, but that goes a long way in distinguishing it from the 7000 other movies of this type.” 53%9. WaterlandHeadey earned her big break in 1992’s Waterland, Stephen Gyllenhaal’s tastefully assembled adaptation of the Graham Swift novel about a teacher (Jeremy Irons) who tries relating to his troubled students by filling them in on his turbulent youth in eastern England. While far from her most prominent role, Headey’s appearance in Waterland kicked off her film career by surrounding her with an array of talented stars that also included Ethan Hawke and the legendary Pete Postlethwaite — and made her part of a solidly assembled indie drama that earned positive reviews from critics like Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who wrote, “With a dazed, frightened expression and the keen sense that his life is coming undone, Mr. Irons’s Tom becomes a rivetingly sad figure, and a sharp focus for the film’s many reveries.” 61%8. 300She’s made her fair share of corseted period pictures, but Lena Headey is also no stranger to genre fare, having appeared in a string of horror movies throughout her career — and the twain sort of met in 2007’s 300, which coupled historically-inspired drama against good old-fashioned blood and guts, all lavishly filmed with director Zack Snyder’s distinctive lens. Inspired by Frank Miller’s comic (which was in turn inspired by the Battle of Thermopylae), 300 racked up more than $450 million in worldwide grosses, thanks to audiences’ unquenchable thirst for great-looking men (including a well-muscled Gerard Butler) and women (including Headey as the occasionally unclothed Queen Gorgo) taking part in impossibly bloody swords ‘n’ sandals drama; it also found purchase with a surprising number of critics, including Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News, who admitted, “It’s impossible not to be moved by its nearly nonstop visual assault.” 64%7. PossessionNeil LaBute isn’t exactly known for his way with romance, but the famously misanthropic writer/director made a well-received foray into the genre with the pleasantly twisty Possession, starring Gwyneth Paltrow opposite LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart as a pair of modern-day literary scholars whose investigation into the possibility of an affair between a pair of Victorian poets (Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle) leads to an unexpected love connection of their own. As Ehle’s potentially spurned partner, Headey rounded out a supporting cast that included Tom Hollander and Toby Stephens; “While the film probably won’t leave you swooning,” admitted Connie Ogle of the Miami Herald, “it is at least an earnest love letter to its transcendent source.” 73%6. The Summer House (Clothes in the Wardrobe)Headey is dishwater-dull as the betrothed Margaret in The Summer House, but that isn’t her fault — the character, as written by Alice Thomas Ellis in her novel and as adapted by director Waris Hussein here, serves as the mousy counterpoint to the story’s true star, a larger-than-life family friend (unforgettably played by Jeanne Moreau) who swans in to save her from being pushed into marrying the limp-wristed boy next door (David Threlfall). It didn’t make much of an impression at the box office, but House was generally well regarded by critics — if only as a vehicle for the irrepressible Moreau, whose stack of accolades included a review from the Washington Post’s Rita Kempley. Describing “her acid tongue and her flaming hair,” Kempley credited her with devouring “this droll British comedy as if it were chaparral and she a raging California brush fire.” 71%5. Mrs. DallowayIt may not have technically been a Merchant Ivory movie, but 1997’s Mrs. Dalloway — a lovingly faithful adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel, starring Vanessa Redgrave as Mrs. Dalloway and featuring a well-rounded cast of talented English actors that included Headey and Rupert Graves — fit squarely into the beautifully filmed run of classic British arthouse romances that the studio released during the ’90s. Warning that the book’s “complex story structure is virtually impossible to reproduce on the screen,” Jeff Vice of the Salt Lake City Deseret News countered, “but thanks to Redgrave’s dazzling turn and some other fine performances, director Marleen Gorris and screenwriter Eileen Atkins come reasonably close.” 79%4. DreddFollowing Sylvester Stallone’s clumsily cartoonish 1995 adaptation of the property, Hollywood avoided the idea of a Judge Dredd movie for a solid decade — but by the middle aughts, with everything old starting to feel new again in studio boardrooms, development slowly ground into gear on what would become 2012’s Dredd. Starring Karl Urban as the distinctively helmeted law enforcer and Headey as a drug dealer who’s plaguing his city with a dangerous new substance nicknamed “Slo-Mo,” this grittily faithful (and ultra-violent) take on the popular comic repented for most of the original movie’s sins — and although it failed to score with audiences, it proved a surprising favorite with critics like Tim Grierson of Deadspin, who beseeched, “If Hollywood is going to be indicted for making mindlessly violent action films, let them at least be as good as this one.” 87%3. AberdeenAfter paying her dues with a number of smaller supporting roles, Heady started coming into her own in the late ’90s — and she graduated into the leading-lady ranks with 2000’s Aberdeen, a road trip drama about an emotionally stunted young woman (Headey) whose life is turned upside down when she gets a call from her mother (Charlotte Rampling) informing her that she needs to bring her dying father (Stellan Skarsgard) to the hospital. Do they meet unusual people and have unforgettable adventures? Do they learn a little something about themselves and each other? You bet they do, but Aberdeen‘s relatively predictable narrative arc was offset by the talent assembled on both sides of the camera; as Stanley Kauffman wrote for the New Republic, “I cannot think of another film that treats so heatedly the range of emotional possibilities between a young woman and her father.” 80%2. Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle BookHeadey continued her streak of supporting roles in handsomely mounted early ’90s productions with Disney’s Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book, a fresh adaptation of the classic story starring Jason Scott Lee as Mowgli, Headey as his love interest Kitty Brydon, and rounded out by an eclectic supporting cast that included John Cleese, Sam Neill, and Cary Elwes. With a marginally more realistic presentation and a rip-roaring, serial-inspired tone established by director Stephen Sommers, this Book reminded a lot of critics more of Raiders of the Lost Ark than anything Kipling ever wrote — but that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, as David Ansen argued for Newsweek. “Kipling purists may not cotton to Disney’s new live-action version of The Jungle Book,” Ansen admitted, “but it’s hard to think of anyone else who won’t be enchanted.” 95%1. The Remains of the DayShortly after landing her breakout role in Waterland, Headey found herself acting among giants on the set of The Remains of the Day, a Merchant Ivory drama adapted from the Kazuo Ishiguro novel about an implacable butler (Anthony Hopkins) and the comparatively hot-tempered housekeeper who grows to love him (Emma Thompson) during their years together in a pre-World War II British estate. Not the stuff of blockbuster epics, obviously, but it picked up eight Academy Award nominations and offered Headey an early (albeit extremely limited) opportunity to share screen time with a gaudy list of co-stars that included Hugh Grant and Christopher Reeve. Among Remains‘ many appreciative critics was Variety’s Todd McCarthy, who wrote, “All the meticulousness, intelligence, taste and superior acting that one expects from Merchant Ivory productions have been brought to bear.”In case you were wondering, here are Headey’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. 300 — 88%2. The Remains of the Day — 85%3. Aberdeen — 76%4. Dredd — 73%5. Face — 69%6. Imagine Me &amp; You — 67%7. Onegin — 67%8. The Summer House (Clothes in the Wardrobe) — 63%9. St. Trinian’s — 57%10.

Joe: Retaliation hitting theaters, we look at some memorable movies based on children's playthings.by Jeff Giles | March 28, 2013 |  CommentsReady or not, a Real American Hero is invading the box office this weekend, and to help herald G.I. Joe: Retaliation‘s arrival in theaters, we decided to dedicate this week’s list to other toys and/or games that made the jump from store shelves to the big screen. It would be wise not to expect any Best Picture winners in here, obviously, but you might be surprised by the amount of good old-fashioned nostalgic fun that can come from reliving memories of movies from an often rather cynically motivated genre. (Word to the wise: This is also one of the most 1980s-centric lists we’ve done in quite some time.) Get ready to beg your parents for more action figures and stuffed animals — it’s time for Total Recall!Battleship 34%Insofar as any movie that was inspired by a game entering its eighth decade of existence can be called a “sure thing,” 2012’s Battleship really seemed to fit the description — directed by action vet Peter Berg and rounded out with a cast that was loaded with what the studio execs like to call “multi-platform synergy,” it launched with a $209 million budget and a prime May release date. Sadly, Battleship was met with some choppy critical waters as it embarked upon its box office voyage — and although it eventually earned more than $300 million worldwide, it ended up going down as one of the year’s costlier flops. “This,” groaned Slate’s Dana Stevens, “is the kind of summer movie that softens your brain tissue without even providing the endocrine burst of pleasure that would make it all worthwhile.”Bratz: The Movie 10%Perhaps chiefly notable for being the movie that jettisoned executive producer/choreographer/wardrobe designer Paula Abdul before a single frame of film was shot, Bratz: The Movie brought its titular line of dolls/cartoon characters to big-screen life via a storyline involving high school cliques, rapper/Tom Hanks offspring Chet Haze, Jon Voight, and a prosthetic nose. Given all that, its $26 million box office gross has to seem like something of a triumph, but critics proved stubbornly unmoved by the Bratz gals’ charms; as Ruthe Stein observed for the San Francisco Chronicle, “The proud owners of Bratz dolls almost surely have had more imaginative fantasies about them than anything onscreen.”The Care Bears Movie 28%In his biggest film role since playing a grumpy retired jockey in 1979’s The Black Stallion, Hollywood legend Mickey Rooney lent his voice to the crucial dual role of “Mr. Nicholas Cherrywood” and “Narrator” in The Care Bears Movie, a 75-minute animated feature that doubled as a thinly disguised commercial for the cuddly stuffed feelings ambassadors created by the American Greetings Corporation. Clearly, the toys made an impact — the Care Bears franchise endures today — and the movie proved a solid hit at the box office, saving the Nelvana studio from bankruptcy on its way to spawning a pair of sequels. For critics, it proved more of a mixed bag, but Richard Grenier of the New York Times appreciated its gentle message, writing that “This endearing movie’s mottoes are: never stop caring. And: the best way to make friends is to be a friend yourself.”Clue 65%Base a movie on a board game, and you’re really setting yourself up for a pretty tough time at the box office — just ask Peter Berg. But of all the board-game-to-film adaptations that have tanked during their initial theatrical runs (um, all two of them), the 1985 ensemble murder mystery farce Clue has fared most respectably by far, steadily building a cult audience after limping into the home video market with a piddling $14.6 million gross. Its 62 percent Tomatometer doesn’t accurately reflect the bewilderment felt by filmgoers who felt cheated by its “three different endings” gimmick, which required the truly hardcore fan to visit multiple theaters in order to see them all, but it’s reflective of the affection currently felt by critics like Gregory Weinkauf of New Times, who said it “deserves its own little niche in camp cinema history.”Dungeons &amp; Dragons 10%If there had to be a movie based on the ever-popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game, the smart money would have been on it making its way to the screen during D&amp;D‘s first flush with mainstream success in the early 1980s — back when, for instance, the game had its own TV series. But the smart money, along with every other kind of money, lost against 2000’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a long-overdue live-action adaptation that found Jeremy Irons, Thora Birch, and Marlon Wayans trying in vain to replicate some semblance of the home version’s magic. Scoffed Susan Stark of the Detroit News, “This movie may be the clumsiest, most inept cinematic exploitation of an item with kid appeal that we have yet seen.”G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra 34%It wasn’t supposed to be this way for G.I. Joe. His true debut, 1987’s G.I. Joe: The Movie, saw its cinematic destiny thwarted when a pair of other Hasbro-sanctioned animated toy adaptations — Transformers: The Movie and My Little Pony: The Movie — were met with failure so ignominious that direct-to-video seemed like the only sensible option. More than two decades later (and with a live-action cast that included Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt), G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra finally brought our Real American hero to theaters. Sadly, 22 years wasn’t enough for most critics, who dismissed Cobra as just one more silly, middlingly acted action flick; as Christopher Orr put it for the New Republic, “Sometimes, a film defies conventional narrative and artistic standards so utterly that it seems unfair to judge it by them…. Consider this a tone poem in 40 scraps of dialogue.”GoBots: Battle of the Rock Lords 20%The only movie on this (or any) list to feature the combined voice-acting might of Telly Savalas, Margot Kidder, and Roddy McDowall, GoBots: Battle of the Rock Lords brought everyone’s second-favorite shape-shifting sentient robots to the big screen in 1986, besting Transformers: The Movie in every way that didn’t count. Optimistically billed as “The First GoBots Movie Ever!,” it would also be the last — which was just fine with critics like Stephen Holden of the New York Times, who dismissed this toy tie-in as “A jerky, semi-coherent series of chases, laser-gun battles and explosions, with an allegorical plot about how no one can handle too much power.”Kit Kittredge: An American Girl 80%Between charming the socks off critics in Little Miss Sunshine and being tied up in a trunk for The Call, Abigail Breslin landed the starring role in Kit Kittredge: An American Girl. A rare theatrical excursion for the burgeoning multimedia American Girl empire, Kit follows the adventures of its plucky Depression-era title character while she pursues her dreams of being a reporter — and her parents (Chris O’Donnell and Julia Ormond) try to stave off foreclosure by turning their home into a boarding house. Sweetly charming — and stacked with a Who’s Who of character actors, including Stanley Tucci, Wallace Shawn, Jane Krakowski, and Joan Cusack — Kit Kittredge won over the hearts of critics like Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum, who called it “A gently thoughtful, audience-appropriate entertainment that assembles swell actors to play colorful characters who don’t shy away from depicting serious hard times.”Masters of the Universe 13%Somehow only the sixth lowest-rated film of Frank “Skeletor” Langella’s career, Masters of the Universe arrived far too late to take advantage of its attendant toy line’s popularity, which had long since waned by the time the adaptation lumbered onto screens in 1987 — and far too clumsily to have any hope of crossing over into the broader filmgoing demographic, or escaping the withering scorn of critics who demanded something more from a movie than the sight of a loincloth-rocking Dolph Lundgren. While it did boast committed work from Langella as He-Man’s nemesis, as well as work from a young Courteney Cox (and one of the stranger entries in Billy Barty’s filmography), Masters really has very little to recommend it; as Rita Kempley noted for the Washington Post, “Little kids at play have come up with craftier plots, better characterization and conceivably more spectacular effects — provided their mothers let them play with matches.”My Little Pony: The MovieOne of the two towering pillars of animated box office failure that forced Hasbro’s toy-to-film ambitions into temporary deep freeze — and sent 1987’s G.I. Joe: The Movie direct to video — My Little Pony: The Movie is notable chiefly for having a showy voice cast that included Tony Randall, Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Cloris Leachman, and Madeline Khan, as well as its role in the founding of AKOM, the Korean animation studio called into action to help beat a last-minute emergency rush. Otherwise, it’s a mostly forgettable footnote in the toy flick canon; although My Little Pony would go on to enjoy a fresh wave of success with the Friendship Is Magic TV series in 2010, its feature-length forebear earned little more than disdain from critics like Nina Darnton of the New York Times, who wrote, “The little ponies are like those pastel heart candies that have little messages on them such as ”I luv you.’ You can eat a few, but too many make you sick.”Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big PawKids are notoriously fickle, so if you want to make a movie based on your popular toy line, you’ve got to strike while the iron is hot (see: Universe, Masters of the). Of course, this tends to be complicated with animated features, seeing as how they tend to take years to develop — but when it came time to release Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw, Carolco came up with a unique solution: Get the whole thing finished in less than six months. We probably don’t need to go into the sordid details of what happened next; suffice it to say that the movie ended up grossing less than $600,000 during its box office run, and pretty much put the final nail in the coffin for the 1980s toy-to-film phenomenon. Sighed Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times, “Pound Puppies lends new vehemence to the expression ‘going to the dogs.'”Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy: A Musical AdventureA children’s favorite since the late 19th century, Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy made their big-screen debut during the 1940s via a series of animated shorts, but they didn’t get their own full-length feature until 1977’s Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy: A Musical Adventure, starring Didi Conn and Mark Baker as the voices of the magical dolls. Fittingly for a movie about sentient toys, this Adventure is memorably bizarre, including a plot about a lecherous pirate who kidnaps the nursery’s new doll and forces our heroic duo to pursue him by camel. Rather dismissively calling it “A nice effort,” TV Guide couldn’t help pointing out that “the film suffers from tedious musical numbers by Joe Raposo that seem to last forever.”Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer 0%Modern children don’t know how good they have it. In a television landscape where several 24-hour channels dedicated to their entertainment exist, they’ll never have to experience the dire circumstances that combined to allow for the ascension of Rainbow Brite. Created by the Hallmark greeting card company in a transparently cynical bid to break into the kiddie tie-in market, she swept through toy shelves and television screens before riding her magical unicorn (voiced by Peter Cullen of Transformers fame) onto the big screen. The results, alas, were far from resplendent; the Boston Globe’s Michael Blowen spoke for the majority of his peers when he called the movie “So incompetently crafted that it makes the Saturday-morning cartoons seem like Disney classics.”Transformers: The Movie 63%Long before Michael Bay surrounded Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox with a few hundred million dollars’ worth of CGI, Hasbro made a generation of sensitive, Optimus Prime-loving children cry with 1986’s Transformers: The Movie, a full-length feature adaptation of the hit cartoon/toy/comic book property about two warring clans of sentient alien robots who are more than meets the eye. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars in Transformers sales and an eye-poppingly eclectic voice cast that included Judd Nelson, Leonard Nimoy, and Eric Idle, the movie didn’t do much of anything at the box office, petering out with a final gross under $6 million. Despite largely negative reviews, it’s gone on to become something of a cult favorite among children of the 1980s, as well as critics like Scott Weinberg, who wrote, “It’s good mindless fun, and a flick that no doubt holds a lot of nostalgia value for several members of my generation’s sci-fi geeks.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Once again, early reviews are solid — which means now is the perfect time to dedicate a feature to taking a fond look back at his earlier efforts. Cover the kids’ ears and keep an eye on Marvin in the back seat, because this week, we’re serving up Total Recall, Tarantino style!Four Rooms (1996)  14%The appeal of anthology films — that audiences can see the work of multiple directors under one narrative umbrella — can also be one of their major drawbacks: The results, as in 1995’s Four Rooms, often strike some viewers as wildly, painfully uneven. As this particular outing proved, success isn’t guaranteed even if you bring together a handful of the industry’s most critically beloved and/or commercially ascendant filmmakers; although Four Rooms united Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, Allison Anders, and Alexandre Rockwell to tell the promise-rich tale of a beleaguered bellhop (Tim Roth) making his way through a series of progressively weirder hotel rooms on New Year’s Eve, only Rodriguez’s segment escaped heaps of withering critical scorn, and the film barely eked out $4 million at the box office. But a 14 percent Tomatometer rating means that a few critics liked it — such as Boxoffice Magazine’s Shlomo Schwartzberg, who shrugged and said, “As a whole, Four Rooms is only diverting, and pretty mindless, but at its best it’s a lot of fun.”Watch TrailerDeath Proof (2007)  65%Forged by the bond of friendship between Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez — as well as their shared love of sloppy, bloody, low-budget exploitation flicks — 2007’s Grindhouse found the two directors splitting a three-hour double bill that took audiences from cheeky zombie terror (Rodriguez’s Planet Terror) to seethingly violent high-octane action (Tarantino’s Death Proof). At 67 percent, Tarantino’s half of Grindhouse got the short end of the Tomatometer stick, but plenty of critics still enjoyed his gleefully depraved look at a homicidal stuntman (Kurt Russell) with a fondness for murdering young ladies. “I’ve rarely seen a filmmaker, in current Hollywood at least, expose his sexual and sadistic kinks on screen with such shameless glee,” observed an admiring Kevin N. Laforest for the Montreal Film Journal.Watch TrailerThe Hateful Eight (2015)  74%What if Quentin Tarantino tried his hand at an Agatha Christie mystery? Filmgoers got their answer to that question — sort of — with 2015’s The Hateful Eight, in which a rogue’s gallery of typically Tarantino-esque characters find themselves bound up in lethally close quarters while a murder mystery inexorably tightens its way toward a gleefully violent conclusion. It’s a setup rich with possibilities for the director’s signature style of filmmaking, and in a fair number of respects, critics said Hateful didn’t disappoint: Tarantino assembled a stellar ensemble cast, including Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, and fed them heaping servings of the sort of pungently knotty dialogue fans have come to expect. Yet while Tarantino’s films have often benefited from an approach to violence that could be charitably described as “enthusiastic,” some scribes admitted to a certain amount of discomfort with the particular brand of bloodshed he unleashed here, identifying a darker, meaner strain that explored racism and misogyny without necessarily offering illumination. “The Hateful Eight is a movie about the worst aspects of human nature, which is why the film can’t be quite described as ‘fun,’ at least in the traditional sense,” wrote the Miami Herald’s Rene Rodriguez. “But Tarantino isn’t glorifying the ugliness; he’s condemning it.”Watch TrailerKill Bill: Volume 2 (2004)  84%Six months after kicking off his Kill Bill revenge saga with Volume 1, Tarantino returned to theaters with its conclusion. Part kung fu brawl, part origin story, Kill Bill: Volume 2 fills in the blanks of its katana-wielding protagonist’s (Uma Thurman) past while she slices and dices her way to whatever passes for redemption. Clocking in at over four hours between the two installments, it’s a pretty hefty cinematic experience for something that boils down to a fairly simple tale, but most critics didn’t mind at all — in fact, Volume 2 performed nearly as well as its predecessor on the Tomatometer. As Jeremy Heilman of MovieMartyr argued, “The massive combination of the first and second Kill Bill movies stands as a testament to both Tarantino’s exceptional skill as a filmmaker and the possibilities of pop cinema.”Watch TrailerKill Bill: Volume 1 (2003)  85%After a seemingly interminable six-year wait following Jackie Brown, Tarantino re-emerged with a blood-spattered martial arts epic so sprawling it needed to be chopped in half. Enter 2003’s Kill Bill: Volume 1, starring Uma Thurman as an assassin whose plans to leave the fold for a life of wedded bliss hit a snag when her mentor (David Carradine) decides he’d rather have her dead than retired, and sends her fellow killers-for-hire (played by Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Michael Madsen) to put a permanent stop to the nuptials. After watching Thurman’s take-no-prisoners performance, the New York Observer’s Andrew Sarris couldn’t help but say, “I would argue that, in a bizarre way, Mr. Tarantino empowers women as no action-genre director before him ever has.”Watch TrailerJackie Brown (1997)  87%Three years after achieving “young Hollywood genius” status with Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino re-emerged with Jackie Brown, a 154-minute adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel Rum Punch that served as Tarantino’s homage to 1970s blaxploitation while resurrecting the career of one of the genre’s biggest stars: Pam Grier. Hitherto known for playing the title role in 1974’s Foxy Brown, Grier returned to the big screen in pretty good company, including Bridget Fonda, Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Chris Tucker, Robert De Niro, and Pulp Fiction star Samuel L. Jackson. While it was ultimately a bit of a critical and commercial letdown after the raging success of Pulp Fiction, Jackie still proved a favorite for scribes like Chuck Rudolph of Matinee Magazine, who wrote that it “Achieves the soulful edge lacking from Tarantino’s previous efforts. Forster and Grier’s performances deserve to join the short-list of all-time greats.”Watch TrailerDjango Unchained (2012)  87%Having entered the realm of social justice revenge fantasy with Inglourious Basterds, Tarantino basically remained there for Django Unchained, a pre-Civil War Western about a slave (Jamie Foxx) in an unorthodox partnership with a bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) who needs his assistance to apprehend of a trio of outlaws — and is willing to not only grant his freedom in exchange, but help Django find and free his wife (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of a sadistic plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio). It’s the perfect setup for two hours and change of profane, gleefully violent action, and Tarantino more than delivers with a star-studded excoriation of systematic injustice that manages to treat its subject with something approaching the proper respect without sacrificing an ounce of momentum. The end result, wrote the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern, is “Wildly extravagant, ferociously violent, ludicrously lurid and outrageously entertaining, yet also, remarkably, very much about the pernicious lunacy of racism and, yes, slavery’s singular horrors.”Watch TrailerInglourious Basterds (2009)  89%Any film fan worth his or her salt has seen plenty of World War II movies, but Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds added a little something special to the mix — an eminently well-cast revenge fantasy, starring a motley crew of solid actors (including Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, and Michael Fassbender) as soldiers in a parallel reality where the evil of the Third Reich is met full force with an Allied squadron whose members are hungry for Nazi blood (and/or scalps). Boasting a uniquely cathartic flavor of Tarantino-brewed violence to go with its taut drama and dark wit, Basterds proved powerfully compelling for critics like Salon’s Stephanie Zacharek, who had to concede, “Quentin Tarantino seems to be hanging on to a lost world of moviemaking. He may be nuts. But he’s a nut who cares.”Watch TrailerReservoir Dogs (1992)  92%Debuts don’t come much more auspicious than Reservoir Dogs. Yes, it’s a profane, blood-splattered heist flick — and goodness knows we have more than enough of those — but this one’s noteworthy for a number of things, including its hyper-literate script, its killer soundtrack, and a cast stuffed with tremendously talented character actors (including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen). While it didn’t exactly set the world on fire during its small theatrical run, it did offer cineastes an early look at one of modern filmmaking’s most exciting, fully formed talents — and it definitely drew the notice of critics like Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, who wrote, “It’s unclear whether this macho thriller does anything to improve the state of the world or our understanding of it, but it certainly sets off enough rockets to hold and shake us for every one of its 99 minutes.”Watch TrailerPulp Fiction (1994)  92%Some careers take a while to get going — and then there’s Quentin Tarantino, who drew almost universal critical praise for Reservoir Dogs before skyrocketing into the Hollywood stratosphere with his second film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. A $214 million box office smash and seven-time Academy Award nominee (as well as Best Original Screenplay winner), Fiction offered a blend of pop culture smarts, laugh-out-loud humor, and shocking violence so potent (and massively influential) that it even managed to revitalize John Travolta’s long-moribund acting career — and left Dusty Springfield’s “Son of a Preacher Man” blasting out of countless college dorm rooms along the way. It was also, as Janet Maslin of the New York Times noted, “A triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino’s ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Pop, a, Black, Spike, 2016, Paramount, hard, horror, Family, NYCC, The, movies, Comic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Kill-Bill.jpg","slug":"tarantino-movies-ranked-by-tomatometer"},{"id":"47508977059302","title":"Total Recall: Steve Buscemi’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Steve Buscemi's Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Incredible Burt Wonderstone star.by Jeff Giles | March 14, 2013 |  CommentsHe hasn’t always played the nicest characters, but both onscreen and off, Steve Buscemi has always come across as a pretty interesting person — a gifted thespian, talented director, and former firefighter who helped clear rubble from the World Trade Center after 9/11, he’s one ubiquitous character actor whose Hollywood success doesn’t seem to have turned him into anything other than a regular guy from Brooklyn. Of course, in this weekend’s The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, he’s anything but regular… which is why we decided we couldn’t miss the opportunity to dedicate a list to some of Buscemi’s best-reviewed roles. It’s time for Total Recall! 88%10. Living in OblivionAllegedly inspired by writer/director Tom DiCillo’s less-than-wonderful experiences on the set of the early Brad Pitt picture Johnny Suede, 1995’s Living in Oblivion starred Buscemi as a put-upon director whose struggles with his emotionally distraught crew (including Dermot Mulroney as the director of photography) and exasperating cast (including Catherine Keener as his difficult leading lady and James LeGros as the buffoonish, possibly Pitt-derived leading man) make it difficult for him — and the audience — to keep track of what’s illusory and what’s real. “So you wanna make a movie?” asked the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson. “Well, first, you should see Living in Oblivion, Tom DiCillo’s savagely funny satire of the world of independent filmmaking.” 89%9. Mystery TrainBuscemi picked up his first Independent Spirit Award nomination for his supporting work in this Jim Jarmusch anthology film consisting of three loosely connected stories — one of which found Buscemi sharing screen time with Joe Strummer, Screamin’ Jay Hawkins, and the decade’s most in-depth discussion of Lost in Space not involving Matt LeBlanc. “The three-part structure of Mystery Train is still a bit shambling and slight,” admitted Entertainment Weekly’s Chris Nashawaty, “but there’s an undeniable air of deadpan cool that permeates the film and gives it a haunting sense of place.” 90%8. The MessengerOne on a growing list of 21st century films about American war that American audiences have largely ignored, 2009’s The Messenger takes the mounting costs of our conflicts and gives them unforgettably human faces — including Will Montgomery and Tony Stone (played by Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson, who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination) as soldiers tasked with delivering casualty notifications to survivors, and Steve Buscemi as a father whose awful grief helps lend the film its gut-punching power before giving it an unexpected twist. “This is a wholly different look at the fallout of the Iraq War and its effect on soldiers and civilians,” offered USA Today’s Claudia Puig. “It is also a gentle portrait of grief, friendship and solace.” 90%7. Barton FinkGenerally speaking, we tend to avoid including cameos and smallish roles in these lists, but those rules are bent when it comes to actors like Buscemi, who can steal an entire movie with little more than a few moments on the screen. One of his more memorable minor parts: Chet the bellhop in Barton Fink, a barely-seen character whose friendliness to Fink (John Turturro) adds a bit of light to an oft-gloomy Coen brothers picture that uses the uneasy partnership between art and commerce as a backdrop for a surreal drama about sex, lies, and a shotgun-toting John Goodman. Calling the end result “Gnomic, claustrophobic, hallucinatory, just plain weird,” Time’s Richard Schickel lauded it as “the kind of movie critics can soak up thousands of words analyzing and cinephiles can soak up at least three espressos arguing their way through.” 92%6. Miller’s CrossingThe gangster drama whose stubborn script eventually prompted the desperate break that birthed Barton Fink, Miller’s Crossing blended well-worn genre formula with the Coen brothers’ signature style — and gave Steve Buscemi an early break with the brief but pivotal role of Mink Larouie, a bookie whose illicit affairs draw him into a gang war that proves deadly (giving the Coens the first of many opportunities to cause Buscemi’s on-screen death). “While Miller’s Crossing is not as messy or inspired as Martin Scorsese’s GoodFellas, or as richly suggestive as The Godfather, it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do,” mused John Hartl for Film.com. 92%5. In the Soup1992 was really Buscemi’s year at Sundance — not only did he make a big splash as part of Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs, but he was also an integral part of Alexandre Rockwell’s highly regarded In the Soup, an offbeat low-budget dramedy about a struggling screenwriter (Buscemi) who desperately teams up with a con man (Seymour Cassel) in order to find financial backing for his meandering 500-page script. Unfortunately overshadowed by some of the higher-profile festival favorites of the year, Soup remained a critical favorite for writers like Combustible Celluloid’s Jeffrey M. Anderson, who admitted, “Yes, it’s an old story that has been told a thousand times before and since, but Alexandre Rockwell’s little film has a home movie charm and a streetwise wit that make it a must-see sleeper.” 93%4. Ghost WorldBuscemi’s ability to imbue even the most unlikable characters with some shred of humanity (think Garland Green in Con Air) has made him a favorite for directors who need someone to play a multi-dimensional cretin. A notable exception: Terry Zwigoff’s Ghost World, a bleakly funny adaptation of the Daniel Clowes comic book about a pair of teenage misfits (Scarlett Johansson and Thora Birch) whose casually mean-spirited prank on a lonely middle-aged man (Buscemi) has unforeseen consequences on their friendship. A cult and critical favorite, Ghost World resonated with scribes like Angie Errigo of Empire, who wrote, “This is ‘teen comedy’ of startling sophistication — with horribly funny bits as well. A true original, with sharp humour, subtle detail and painfully realistic characters.” 94%3. FargoAfter filming small-but-pivotal parts in the Coen brothers’ Miller’s Crossing and Barton Fink, Buscemi was rewarded with a role written specifically for him in their 1996 breakthrough, Fargo. A seven-time Academy Award nominee (and two-time winner) that now resides in the National Film Registry, it tells the increasingly unpleasant tale of a car dealership manager (William H. Macy) who tries to get out from under his financial woes by hiring a pair of small-time crooks (Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so he can fool his wealthy father-in-law into paying the ransom. A grisly comedy of errors ensues, with the kidnappers leaving a trail of death in their wake and a tenacious cop (Frances McDormand) in hot pursuit. “To watch it is to experience steadily mounting delight,” smiled Roger Ebert, “as you realize the filmmakers have taken enormous risks, gotten away with them and made a movie that is completely original, and as familiar as an old shoe.” 92%2. Reservoir DogsA heist movie without the heist — but with a far sharper (as well as gorier and more profane) script than most movies of its kind, Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs helped kick off the indie film boom of the 1990s with a tightly wound, beautifully cast look at what happens when a group of really bad guys try to pull off a big score and it all goes wrong. Working with a scarily talented group of character actors, Tarantino — who was making his feature debut — made it count by giving Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Buscemi (as the weaselly Mr. Pink, a role Tarantino originally planned to take for himself) some of the most memorable scenes of their careers. “It’s unclear whether this macho thriller does anything to improve the state of the world or our understanding of it,” admitted the Chicago Reader’s Jonathan Rosenbaum, “but it certainly sets off enough rockets to hold and shake us for every one of its 99 minutes.” 96%1. Monsters, Inc.It’s always a bit of a disappointment when an animated film ends up at the top of an actor’s Total Recall list — and we know more than a few of you think voice roles shouldn’t count at all — but if it has to happen, then it might as well be a movie as wonderful as Monsters, Inc. Starting from a rich premise (what if the monsters in your kid’s closet are real…and they’re scared too?), Pixar’s fourth feature used its universal concept as the framework for a thoughtful, ecologically conscious rumination on the journey from childhood to adulthood. Plus, it was exciting and really funny, thanks to a stellar voice cast that included Billy Crystal and John Goodman (as monster pals Mike and Sulley), James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, and (of course) Steve Buscemi as the nasty monster Randall Boggs. It all added up to a massive box office hit — and a movie that, in the words of Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Times, acts as “A marvelous combination of lollipop visuals, brilliant screenwriting, sharp comedic timing and, above all, overflowing amounts of heart.”In case you were wondering, here are Buscemi’s top 10 movies according&nbsp;to RT users’ scores:1. Reservoir Dogs — 93%2. The Big Lebowski — 93%3. Fargo — 91%4. Miller’s Crossing — 88%5. Barton Fink — 87%6. Mystery Train — 86%7. Monsters, Inc. — 84%8. Living in Oblivion — 84%9.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

The debate between Team Jacob and Team Edward reaches its senses-shattering conclusion this week, with the release of Breaking Dawn Part 2, but no matter which side you’re on, there’s no denying that Stewart’s film career has always been about more than vampires and werewolves. Over the last decade, she’s assembled a crowded, surprisingly eclectic filmography, and Breaking Dawn Part 2 is only one part of a busy year that also includes her turn in On the Road, debuting December 21; we decided to join in the fun by celebrating her work with this week’s Total Recall. Without further ado, here are Kristen Stewart’s best-reviewed movies! 50%10. What Just Happened?A few weeks before Twilight descended upon theaters, Stewart appeared in a very different sort of film: Barry Levinson’s What Just Happened, a tragicomic adaptation of producer Art Linson’s memoirs, which provide a bitter window into the absurd behind-the-scenes drama that filmmakers often face. Playing the teenage Zoe, daughter of the beleaguered film producer played by Robert De Niro, Stewart understandably received less screen time than some of her more famous co-stars (including Bruce Willis and Sean Penn), but Happened gave her the opportunity to rub shoulders with some big names — not to mention the chance to play a character whose penchant for eye-rolling, back-talking, and bedding older men was far removed from Bella Swan’s chaste longing. Though most critics felt it didn’t have enough bite, others thought it went just far enough; the Houston Chronicle’s Amy Biancolli, for one, called it “the sharpest Hollywood satire since The Player.” 54%9. Welcome to the RileysIn the midst of Twilight mania, Stewart stepped away from the supernatural for 2010’s Welcome to the Rileys, an indie drama about a grieving father (James Gandolfini) who copes with the death of his daughter by starting an offbeat adoptive relationship with a troubled stripper (Stewart) while his wife (Melissa Leo) walls herself away in their home. Ultimately, in true Sundance fashion, all three of them end up learning something about themselves — but even if the movie walks to a by-now familiar beat, a number of critics felt the cast was strong enough to anchor its less believable moments. Lauding the end result as “Quietly assured and superbly written,” ViewLondon’s Matthew Turner called Rileys “an emotionally engaging drama with a trio of terrific performances from James Gandolfini, Kristen Stewart and Melissa Leo.” 55%8. UndertowFor a perfect example of how diverse Stewart’s acting choices have been, just look at 2004, when she followed her starring turn in Catch That Kid with a supporting role in David Gordon Green’s Undertow, a moody Southern Gothic thriller about the bloody chaos that erupts when an ex-con (Josh Lucas) moves in with his brother (Dermot Mulroney) and his nephews (Jamie Bell and Devon Alan) on their remote Georgia farm. As Lila, the girlfriend of Bell’s character, Stewart embodies the idyllic, albeit hardscrabble, existence that the boys are forced to flee when the violence Lucas carries with him inevitably erupts — and she also gets to reel off one of the strangest lines ever uttered in a teenage love scene: “Can I carve my name in your face?” While it didn’t earn as much money or critical approval as Green’s previous film, All the Real Girls, Undertow managed to cast a spell on a number of critics, including Film Threat’s Stina Chyn, who applauded: “Structured like a fairytale and driven like a fast boat down a leafy river, Undertow expertly blends myth and suspense to create a fable with a wicked sense of humor and an appetite for destruction.” 64%7. The Cake EatersIt took two years to make its way to theaters, it’s an independent feature populated with quirky characters who have names like Beagle and Easy, and it marks the cinematic directorial debut of Mary Stuart Masterson — but don’t dismiss The Cake Eaters out of hand as just another purposely offbeat indie. Here, Stewart plays a teenage girl afflicted with a rare, incurable disease; it’s a role that could easily have been dragged into scenery-chewing melodrama, but she played it subtly, adding her restrained performance to those of a fine cast that included Bruce Dern and Melissa Leo. Though few people saw The Cake Eaters when it finally reached theaters in 2009, it made a profound impact on a number of critics, including the New York Post’s V.A. Musetto, who clucked, “With so much junk cluttering movie houses, it is a shame that it took two years for this sweet, intelligent drama to get a release before heading for DVD. But such is the sad state of the movie business.” 66%6. The Yellow HandkerchiefDuring the long buildup to The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, Kristen Stewart snuck in a supporting role in The Yellow Handkerchief, a quiet, character-driven indie about an ex-con (played by William Hurt) whose return to his Louisiana home — and the ex-wife (Maria Bello) he left behind — becomes a journey of self-discovery, not only for himself, but for his two teen traveling companions. As the 15-year-old runaway Martine, Stewart might have been stuck with another petulant adolescent role, but Erin Dignam’s script (adapted from a Pete Hamill story) offered more subtly shaded characterizations than most, and Udayan Prasad’s unobtrusive direction gave the cast room to shine. And shine they did: Although The Yellow Handkerchief‘s stately pace and rather minimal storyline arc turned off some critics (ReelViews’ James Berardinelli summed it up as “Sluggish. Torpid. Boring”), most felt that all-around superlative performances from the movie’s stars were more than enough to make up for any flaws. “You don’t need an original story for a movie,” wrote Roger Ebert in his review. “You need original characters and living dialogue.” 69%5. The RunawaysIf she was at all concerned about Twilight typecasting, Stewart could hardly have picked a better way to fight it than playing Joan Jett to Dakota Fanning’s Cherie Currie in The Runaways. Not only did Floria Sigismondi’s biopic of the groundbreaking (albeit short-lived) band give Stewart the chance to adopt a tough rock-and-roll swagger, but her striking resemblance to Jett helped remind filmgoers she’d always been more than Bella Swan. And by most accounts, Stewart nailed her performance, projecting a combination of pent-up aggression and teenage insecurity that helped make The Runaways more than just a $10 million episode of Behind the Music. While a sizable number of critics felt the movie didn’t delve deep enough, most considered it an exceptionally well-acted biopic, with Stewart, Fanning, and Michael Shannon repeatedly singled out for their work. Perhaps no one went further than Cinemablend’s Josh Tyler, who gushed, “Kristen Stewart is a modern day James Dean.” 76%4. ZathuraBetween his smash hits Elf and Iron Man, Jon Favreau directed a little family sci-fi thriller called Zathura. Adapted from the book of the same name by author Chris Van Allsburg (Jumanji), Zathura follows the fantastical adventures of a pair of quarreling brothers (played by Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson) whose squabbles reach epic proportions when they make the mistake of playing the titular board game, which magically transports their house into outer space — and the middle of a battle with alien creatures called Zorgons. In the middle of all this chaos is Kristen Stewart as the boys’ older sister, who spends a decent portion of the film in cryogenic deep freeze. A thankless role, perhaps, and Zathura went down as a rather surprising commercial failure — but as far as most critics were concerned, the movie did exactly what it was supposed to. As David Edwards wrote for the Daily Mirror, “Zathura is one of those rare movies that should appeal to kids and adults alike thanks to a great little storyline, neat special effects and a genuinely likeable cast.” 75%3. Panic RoomAfter some early uncredited roles (including one in The Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas) and an appearance in The Safety of Objects, Stewart received her first big break with David Fincher’s Fight Club follow-up, the 2002 thriller Panic Room. It presented a tremendous opportunity for Stewart, who not only shared her scenes with Jodie Foster as her on-screen mom, but spent most of the movie trapped in a single room. Of course, Fincher being Fincher, Panic Room livened up its claustrophobic premise with plenty of style, but still — this is a movie about two women hiding in their home from a crew of burglars, and if Stewart hadn’t been able to hold her own against Foster in the acting department, none of it would have worked. A respectable $196 million worldwide hit, Room prompted slight disappointment from critics who yearned for another subversive, Fight Club-style jolt from Fincher, but Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post spoke for the majority when he called it “powerfully manipulative, quite clever and full of evil ambition.” 83%2. Into the WildOne of 2007’s most critically lauded, award-hungry films, Into the Wild adapted the true-life story of Christopher McCandless, a young, uncompromising idealist who shed his material possessions and embarked on a solitary journey that ultimately took him into the Alaskan wilderness — and to his death. McCandless has been an understandably divisive figure since Jon Krakauer made his story famous with a non-fiction book (also titled Into the Wild) retracing his doomed path, but for director Sean Penn, his tale was tragic and arguably noble — and Emile Hirsch’s empathetic portrayal of McCandless made it easy to see why. Given the nature of the story, Hirsch necessarily dominated Wild, but Penn lined up a stellar supporting cast that included William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, and (of course) Kristen Stewart. Here, Stewart plays Tracy Tatro, a girl McCandless meets while passing through a Southern California desert commune — and ultimately leaves behind so he can camp out in an abandoned bus. Along with most of McCandless’ decisions, it’s a little hard to fathom — but for most critics, the lessons of his life were rich and profound. As Bill Goodykoontz wrote for the Arizona Republic, “though it’s easy to dismiss McCandless’ hippified musings and near-suicidal choices as the misguided actions of a kid who read Walden a little too closely in college, Penn’s film aims for something more, a deeper telling of a tale of yearning and escape.” 89%1. AdventurelandFor his follow-up to Superbad, director Greg Mottola opted for another coming-of-age story — but Adventureland is far from a carbon copy of its predecessor, offering a darker, subtler, far more personal take on life at the cusp of adulthood. This time around, Mottola, who wrote the script, took filmgoers back to the late 1980s to tell the tale of James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg), a recent college graduate whose dreams of a celebratory trip to Europe are shattered by his suddenly cash-poor parents. Finding the summer job market lacking, James is forced to take a job at the local theme park, where he meets Em (Kristen Stewart), an NYU student with a rocky home life and a thing for older men who look like Ryan Reynolds. As you can probably tell, Adventureland doesn’t offer quite as many yuks as Superbad; unfortunately, the studio’s marketing campaign decided to focus on Mottola’s recent past, and the trailer focused on testicle-punching gags instead of the movie’s more thoughtful side. Perhaps as a result, Adventureland didn’t make a ton of money during its theatrical run — but it was a big hit with critics, who appreciated Mottola’s obvious affection for his characters and the authentically 1980s touches dotting the screen. The cast earned high marks, too, including Stewart, who prompted Tom Long of the Detroit News to write, “Yes, you’ve seen much of it before, and the nervous James character is now officially a cliché. But Stewart makes you care anyway. This, folks, is an actress.”In case you were wondering, here are Craig’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Into the Wild — 90%2. Twilight — 82%3.

With plenty of other folkloric fantasy adaptations in our recent past (Red Riding Hood, Beastly) and plenty more on the horizon (including Jack the Giant Killer and Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters), fairy tales are having something of a moment right now — but as any film fan could tell you, and as this week’s list demonstrates, this is nothing new in Hollywood. There are countless examples of filmmakers turning to fairy tales for inspiration, but we couldn’t possibly fit all those once upon a times and happily ever afters into a single feature. Which of your favorites made the cut? Find out in the latest Total Recall!Beauty and the Beast 94%We could have filled this list with Disney pictures, but that wouldn’t have been nearly as much fun — and still, when the time came to pick a Beauty and the Beast for our feature, it was no contest. A huge, Best Picture-nominated hit during its original run — and a big success all over again during its repeated reissues — Disney’s version of this timeless tale is the one that comes to mind for multiple generations when they think of Beauty and the Beast. And while it may have taken a few storyline liberties with the original text (and while the IMAX and 3D additions don’t really improve the story), the most important part remains: As Jay Boyar wrote for the Orlando Sentinel, it “Moves us because we know that true love can sometimes seem like a mismatch. And also because, in love, we can all feel like captives or beasts.”The Brothers Grimm 38%Their stories have inspired plenty of films, so it’s only fitting that Wilhelm and Jakob Grimm got to topline their own movie in 2005 — albeit one that starred Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as wildly fictionalized versions of the brothers. With a pair of matinee idols in the leads, Terry Gilliam behind the cameras, and an effects-heavy storyline that pitted the Grimms against a fairy tale curse and a wicked queen, The Brothers Grimm could have been a smash hit; unfortunately, its strife-plagued production only led to indifferent reviews and a mildly disappointing $105 million gross. Still, some critics thought Gilliam’s flair was enough to transcend the film’s flaws; as Bob Strauss of the Los Angeles Daily News argued, “You won’t want to pass this version of The Brothers Grimm on to your children. But you may find yourself coming back to marvel at parts of it for the rest of your life.”Ever After: A Cinderella Story 91%Starring an utterly winsome Drew Barrymore as the young woman who catches a prince’s eye — but has to overcome her stepmother’s cruel mistreatment to find true love — 1998’s Ever After drew on historical details for its background while offering a postmodern twist to the Cinderella story, positioning its heroine as a woman capable of saving herself from peril (and her royal beau, if need be). Sure, the audience knew the whole story by heart, but with Andy Tennant’s sumptuous direction, a supporting cast that included Anjelica Huston and Dougray Scott, and Barrymore in those glass slippers, they didn’t mind watching it unfold one more time — and neither did Roger Ebert, who proclaimed, “The old tale still has life and passion in it.”Freeway 77%When she made her debut in 1991’s The Man in the Moon, Reese Witherspoon looked like a luminous, innocent kid. Fast-forward five years later to Freeway, and goodness gracious, how things changed: A miniskirt-rocking Witherspoon starred opposite Kiefer Sutherland in this grimy, violent loose update on the story of Red Riding Hood, following a prostitute’s daughter on her dangerous journey up southern California’s I-5 freeway to find her grandmother. (Sutherland, naturally, was the leering serial killer standing in for the wolf.) While not a particularly pleasant film, Freeway earned its young star some career-boosting rave reviews, including Margaret A. McGurk’s writeup for the Cincinnati Enquirer: “I didn’t particularly want to like Freeway,” admitted McGurk, “but I couldn’t help myself. Reese Witherspoon made me.”Hans Christian Andersen 83%It’s named after the famous storyteller, but don’t watch 1952’s Hans Christian Andersen looking for a biopic; instead, producer Samuel Goldwyn opted to create a typically lavish musical extravaganza, starring Danny Kaye as Andersen in a sort of fairytale revue that includes nods to “The Little Mermaid,” “Thumbelina,” “The Ugly Duckling,” and “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” As a result, it’s sort of all over the place, but it has a certain gregarious charm that wasn’t lost on audiences, the Academy (who nominated it for six Oscars), or critics; as Variety put it, “No attempt at biography is made, so the imaginative production has full rein in bringing in songs and ballet numbers to round out the Andersen fairy tales told by Kaye.”The Pied Piper 44%Take a heaping helping of 1960s psychedelic strangeness, stir it into the timeless legend of the Pied Piper, and you’ve got this 1972 drama starring folk troubadour Donovan as the piper, who’s tricked by the unscrupulous Donald Pleasance into exterminating a village’s worth of rats and is then shortchanged on the fee. You know what happens next — the Piper gets even by stealing the village’s children, Donovan performs a few musical numbers, and Dylan humiliates him at a party. (Oh, wait — wrong movie.) Generally speaking, critics weren’t as entranced by The Pied Piper as the kids in the movie, but it earned nods of approval from a few scribes — including J. Hoberman of the Village Voice, who called it “A dark and smoky affair that, although set in Germany during the Black Death summer of 1349, suggests something brainstormed in a St. Marks Place head shop.”Pinocchio 0%Like plenty of other Oscar-winning actors, Roberto Benigni used the clout he earned with his awards (Best Actor and Best Foreign Film for Life Is Beautiful) to help get his passion project made. And it had plenty of potential, too — Carlo Callodi’s The Adventures of Pinocchio is a classic book, but the character has become more closely identified with its somewhat bowdlerized Disney counterpart, and Benigni could have channeled his love for the book into a more faithful film. Alas, he chose instead to create one of the strangest (and vaguely creepiest) family movies of the 21st century, starring Benigni himself (who also directed and co-wrote the script) as the impish wooden boy. In fairness, it should be pointed out that the international version of Pinocchio did fairly well, but in the States, the English overdubs only compounded the overall weirdness of what unfolded on the screen. As an incredulous Edward Guthmann asked for the San Francisco Chronicle: “What can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log?”Shrek 88%Strictly speaking, the Shrek franchise was inspired by the classic William Stieg children’s book from which it takes its name — but along the way, the four Shrek films (plus their Puss in Boots spinoff) have gotten a lot of mileage out of lampooning fairy tales. From the first film, which featured a heroic ogre and a princess who knew kung fu — not to mention comedic cameos from Pinocchio, the Gingerbread Man, the Three Little Pigs, and many others — the Shrek series has offered critically approved (and wildly commercially successful) proof that there’s still plenty of creative life left in the stories we all know by heart. They are, as CNN’s Paul Tatara wrote of the first film, “A heck of a lot of fun — even if you don’t believe in fairy tales.”Sydney White 35%Put Snow White on a modern college campus and substitute a gaggle of social outcasts for the seven dwarves, and you’ve got 2007’s Sydney White, an Amanda Bynes rom-com about an adorably perky freshman who runs afoul of a popular girl on campus and ends up befriending seven unpopular kids. Along the way, she unwittingly infuriates her nemesis with her widely acknowledged beauty, suffering the effects of an infected Apple (computer) for her transgression before being kissed by…well, you know the story. In spite of Bynes’ charms and the aforementioned clever modern parallels, Sydney struck out with audiences as well as most critics — although it proved a pleasant diversion for Laura Kern of the New York Times, who argued, “Ms. Bynes, with her cherubic face, expressive eyes and comic timing, helps create a positive, pleasing diversion that caters to the geek in all of us.”tom thumb 67%Starring Russ Tamblyn in the title role, this 1958 production put a whimsical (and appropriately special effects-heavy) spin on the tale of a diminutive lad who always seems to be getting himself out of one horrible jam after another. With a stellar supporting cast that included Alan Young and Peter Sellers, soundtrack assistance from Peggy Lee, and direction from FX wiz George Pal, tom thumb turned a handsome profit at the box office, earned an Academy Award for Special Effects, and earned praise from a number of critics — including the folks at Film4, who called it “one of the most memorable and beloved films directed by special-effects pioneer Pal, with Tamblyn looking bright and fresh-faced as the diminutive fairytale hero.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

But that isn’t all Vaughn can do, as he’s proven while assembling an admirably eclectic filmography, moving from comedy to horror to action thrillers and back again, turning in memorable cameoes in films as diverse as Into the Wild, and Anchorman, and sharing screens with everyone from Richard Attenborough to Jennifer Lopez in the process. When HBO’s hit drama True Detective returns next year, Vaughn will take his place as one of the new season’s lead actors, and to celebrate, we decided to revisit his best-reviewed films, Total Recall style! 54%10. A Cool, Dry PlaceBased on Michael Grant Jaffe’s novel Dance Real Slow, 1998’s A Cool, Dry Place broke Vaughn’s string of rapscallions and ne’er-do-wells and gave him the first thoroughly sympathetic role of his career: Russell Durrell, a young lawyer struggling through single fatherhood after his wife (Monica Potter) abandons him and their five-year-old son (Bobby Moat). Despite a cast that also included Joey Lauren Adams, Place barely squeaked its way into theaters, grossing a few thousand dollars during a one-week run — and though many critics rolled their eyes at the film’s leisurely pace and heavy melodrama (Filmcritic’s Christopher Null accused the plot of “just [sitting] there like a stuffed monkey”), they were matched by scribes such as Sandra Contreras of TV Guide, who wrote, “Its heart is in the right place, but this sweet drama just doesn’t build enough true drama from its slender premise. That said, it’s not bad enough to merit the kind of stealth release its studio has imposed on it.” 60%9. Mr. and Mrs. SmithTake The War of the Roses, inject it with some loud, glossy, big-budget action, add a dash of potent sexy chemistry between your stars, and you’ve got 2005’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith — as well as a pretty fantastic formula for a blockbuster summer flick. Smith could easily have been overshadowed by all the tabloid speculation that dogged Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s relationship; this is, after all, the movie that gave the world Brangelina. But if filmgoers came for glimpses of real-life sparks, they stayed for the snappy one-liners in Simon Kinberg’s script, director Doug Liman’s well-staged (albeit thoroughly ludicrous) action set pieces, a terrific supporting cast that included Vince Vaughn, Kerry Washington, Angela Bassett, and character actor extraordinaire Keith David, as well as the sheer spectacle of two very attractive people dispatching bad guys and blowing stuff up while they decide whether they want to stay married or kill each other. It certainly isn’t high art, but the movie has a fizzy charm that Roger Ebert summed up by writing, “What makes the movie work is that Pitt and Jolie have fun together on the screen, and they’re able to find a rhythm that allows them to be understated and amused even during the most alarming developments.” 60%8. Old SchoolAfter 2000’s The Cell, Vaughn was relatively quiet for a few years; although he appeared in a pair of major releases (Domestic Disturbance and Made, both released in 2001), he spent much of his time in films whose appeal was more, uh, selective (The Prime Gig, I Love Your Work). It took another testosterone-heavy ensemble comedy to remind audiences what made the Swingers star famous — and okay, so Old School ended up being stolen by Will Ferrell, but Vaughn got his share of laughs, too, and it foreshadowed his funny roles in Anchorman and Starsky &amp; Hutch. A not inconsiderable number of critics dismissed Old School‘s raunchy lowbrow humor, but the majority agreed with Cinerina’s Karina Montgomery, who gasped, “I can’t believe it, but I want to see it again.” 62%7. Clay PigeonsAfter making a splash with Swingers, Vaughn hit the ground running, booking roles in several years’ worth of big-budget productions, including 1997’s Jurassic Park sequel, The Lost World, and the costly Jennifer Lopez flop The Cell. Between the tentpoles, however, Vaughn hadn’t lost his taste for the odd lower-profile project — like Clay Pigeons, a Ridley Scott-produced black comedy about a drifter (Vaughn) who uses his imagined friendship with a casual acquaintance (Joaquin Phoenix) as the impetus for a homicidal, Throw Momma from the Train-style “favor.” Playing a charming, murderous lunatic helped prep Vaughn for the starring role in Gus Van Sant’s Psycho remake — and while Pigeons didn’t make much of an impression at the box office, it earned the admiration of critics like the Palo Alto Weekly’s Jeanne Aufmuth, who wrote, “This is not your classic whodunit. It’s blacker, funnier, and edgier.” 62%6. Starsky &amp; HutchThe overlap on the Venn diagram between Dodgeball and Wedding Crashers, 2004’s Starsky &amp; Hutch stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as the titular detectives — and Vaughn as Reese Feldman, the bar mitzvah-throwing drug kingpin who’s responsible for pushing a new, untraceable form of cocaine. While a number of critics were turned off by the way the movie enthusiastically embraced its cheesy television roots, for most, it was too goofily good-natured to resist — right down to Snoop Dogg’s appearance as the streetwise police informant known as Huggy Bear. It is, wrote Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post, “A really good not-great movie, the kind that would be classified as a guilty pleasure were it not executed with guilt-free honesty and good nature.” 71%5. Dodgeball – A True Underdog StoryVaughn has an admirably varied resume, having done everything from thrillers to dramas to comedies, but if forced to choose, most people would probably say he works most successfully as half of a comic duo. Enter 2004’s Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, which pits Vaughn against a hilariously over-the-top Ben Stiller in a fight to the finish to be decided by bouncy rubber balls traveling at punishingly high speeds. The idea of a movie about grown men playing professional dodge ball is funny all by itself, and when you have the added benefit of a cast stuffed with funny supporting players (including Jason Bateman, Gary Cole, Stephen Root, and Rip Torn), you’re almost assured of a movie that’ll make at least two-thirds of its audience laugh — and, as it turns out, 70 percent of the world’s top critics. Of course, there were a few curmudgeons turned off by Dodgeball‘s broad humor, but most reviews echoed the sentiments of Rolling Stone’s Peter Travers, who wrote, “This masterpiece of modern cinema depends upon a single truism: A guy getting hit in the nuts a hundred times in a row is funny a hundred times.” 71%4. Return to ParadiseThis Joseph Ruben-directed remake of the 1989 French movie Force majeure arrived during a period when American filmmakers were apparently pretty fascinated with the travails of reckless U.S. tourists in Southeast Asian prisons — Brokedown Palace was released a year later, and both films were compared unfavorably with Alan Parker’s Midnight Express. Starring Vaughn, Joaquin Phoenix, and David Conrad as a trio of pot-puffing Malaysian tourists who inadvertently run afoul of the law, Paradise took a familiar plot device — innocent American awaiting death in a foreign prison — and added a new wrinkle: Vaughn and Conrad, safe on U.S. soil, are told they can save Phoenix from being hanged, but only if they return to Malaysia to do hard time. Though the script wasn’t without its fair share of contrivances, Paradise‘s thorny moral dilemma was enough to satisfy most critics, and even those who didn’t give the movie their stamp of approval tended to find positive aspects — like Luisa F. Ribeiro of Boxoffice Magazine, who wrote, “Vaughn labors mightily under the obviousness of the script, while managing to reveal a fragile but profound fear of being an aging frat boy who longs to realize a finer, better self, only to be petrified that quality isn’t within him.” 71%3. MadeFive years after they gave each other their big break in Swingers, Vaughn and Jon Favreau reunited — this time, with Favreau behind the camera in addition to writing the script — for the mob comedy Made. Starring Vaughn and Favreau as a pair of low-level Mafia knuckleheads, Made took their funny, fast-paced banter, surrounded it with a bigger budget, and added drugs, violence, and Sean “Diddy” Combs. Predictably, critics couldn’t help but compare Made to its surprise hit predecessor — and just as predictably, these comparisons didn’t do Made any favors. Still, even if Made didn’t reach Swingers‘ lofty critical heights (and barely made back its budget), Vaughn and Favreau’s chemistry remained potent enough to impress critics like Hollywood.com’s Stacie Hougland, who wrote, “Vaughn hits the bullseye as a strident, volatile jerk who can’t keep his mouth shut. You never really like him, but you can’t wait to see what he’ll do next — his missteps and offenses are so unbelievable you wince, but you can’t look away.” 76%2. Wedding CrashersPart of the R-rated comedy renaissance of the aughts, Wedding Crashers may not have given Vaughn the opportunity to do anything new — here, he appears as Jeremy Grey, a lech with a heart of gold who isn’t terribly dissimilar from the character he played in Swingers — but it played squarely to Vaughn’s comedic gifts, had a solid Steve Faber/Bob Fisher script, and surrounded Vaughn and his co-star, Owen Wilson, with some terrific supporting talent, including Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams, and Isla Fisher as the crazy nymphomaniac who thrills and torments Vaughn in equal measure. Though some critics had problems with Crashers‘ uneven tone — and the scads of gratuitous flesh on display in the movie’s opening montage — most found it too much fun to resist. “The likes of the sneakily subversive Wilson and Vaughn deserve better,” wrote MaryAnn Johnson of Flick Filosopher, “but this is darn close to a perfect showcase for what they can do, and how much better they do it together.” 87%1. SwingersSomehow, we doubt many of you are surprised that this list ends where it all began for Vince Vaughn — specifically, with his scene-stealing turn as the appealingly smarmy Trent Walker, best bud to Jon Favreau’s sad sack Mike Peters. Favreau may have written the script, but it was Vaughn who ended up with many of Swingers‘ best lines — and although it’s true that those lines inspired countless wannabe hipsters to pronounce various persons and objects as “so money” for years to come, that’s just an unfortunate byproduct of the movie’s immense likability, and Vaughn’s seemingly effortless cool in the role, which showcased his gifts for comedy and drama. “Four guys hang out, kid one another, get into scuffles and flash their gonadal searchlight for available women,” wrote Time’s Richard Corliss. “Yikes, haven’t there been enough variations on the multiple-buddy movie? Actually, no.”In case you were wondering, here are Vaughn’s top 10 movies according&nbsp;to RT users’ scores:1. Swingers — 89%2. Old School — 86%3. Dodgeball – A True Underdog Story — 76%4.

This isn’t the first time multiple movies have shared a title, of course — last week’s action thriller Safe shared a title with a Todd Haynes drama. But noticing the latest example on the release schedule got us thinking — and by the time we’d finished thinking, we had ourselves yet another list. From Oscar nominees to infamous duds, here are 25 movies with only a dozen titles between them. It’s time for Total Recall!The Avengers&nbsp;1998 5%&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;2012 91%Any film fan worth his salt has probably seen a few jokers on Twitter and Facebook pretending to think this weekend’s Avengers is an adaptation of the old TV spy series. But not so long ago, that actually happened: 1998’s The Avengers drew inspiration from the show, and boasted a terrific cast that included Sean Connery, Ralph Fiennes, and Uma Thurman — but still died a horrible death in theaters, where its theatrical run was marked by brutal reviews and disappointing grosses. Even before its American debut, the 2012 Avengers already has the critical and commercial edge, as well as a pretty impressive cast of its own. It’s no contest — when choosing between these two cinematic crimefighting teams, we’ll take Marvel’s superheroes every time.Black Sheep&nbsp;1996 28%&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;2006 72%Like most right-minded film fans, when we read Black Sheep, we think of the 1996 Chris Farley/David Spade comedy about… well, it doesn’t really matter what the plot is about, does it? It’s about a big guy and a smaller guy on some outlandishly goofy comedic adventures, and even if it isn’t as funny as Tommy Boy, the Farley/Spade pairing always had enough juice to make up for some of the less egregious flaws in the scripts they were given. Imagine our surprise when we discovered that the Tomatometer champion in the Black Sheep wars is a 2006 horror-comedy hybrid about a flock of genetically engineered sheep who go on a killing spree across the New Zealand countryside. As hard as it is for us to disrespect one of the preeminent comedy teams of the early ’90s, we’re forced to give the nod to the ’06 Sheep here — you’ve got your pick of movies with a fat guy in a little coat, but how many times do you get to see killer sheep?Blown Away&nbsp;1992&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;1994 38%The differences between Stephen Hopkins’ bomb squad actioner and the Corey-powered erotic thriller are about as stark as their respective interpretations of the title they share. One stars Jeff Bridges as a Boston cop terrorized by an escaped bomber (Tommy Lee Jones) he once called a friend; the other stars notable teen duo Corey Feldman and Corey Haim as half-brothers who are swept into a murder plot when one of them (Haim) falls for a seductive femme fatale (Baywatch‘s Nicole Eggert). Unfortunately, neither film really blew anyone away, as the novelty of “The Two Coreys” had already begun to wane by 1992, and despite the star power of Bridges and Jones, the 1994 film suffered from comparisons to the similarly-themed Speed, which hit theaters just a month before it. Leave it to two movies called Blown Away to bomb, both critically and commercially.Crossroads&nbsp;1986 75%&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;2002 14%Like a few others on this list, Crossroads is a generic enough title that several films have adopted it, though we’ll be focusing on the two that have Tomatometers. Specifically, this means comparing two road movies heavily informed by music: 1986’s Crossroads, directed by Walter Hill and starring Ralph Macchio as a young guitarist in search of a lost song by legendary blues man Robert Johnson; and 2002’s Crossroads, starring Britney Spears, Taryn Manning, and Zoe Saldana as three estranged childhood friends who reunite on the night of their high school graduation and embark on a road trip from Louisiana to California. Spears’ pop icon status was still fully intact when her film opened, but that didn’t stop Crossroads from being terribly silly and clichéd, with a few bizarrely dark moments. Hill’s film, on the other hand, not only demonstrated an affection for its subject matter, it featured a climactic guitar battle between The Karate Kid and Steve Vai as the Devil’s minion. There is no contest here.The Fast and the Furious&nbsp;1954&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;2001 53%They’re separated by nearly 50 years and millions of budget dollars, but it should come as no surprise that our two The Fast and the Furiouses have plenty in common — specifically, they both revolve around morally complex men forced into bad behavior by tricky legal situations. In the 1954 version, it’s John Ireland who, as ex-con Frank Webster, kidnaps a woman (Dorothy Malone) and poses as a road rally driver in order to escape the law long enough to reach the border. The second time around, we saw Paul Walker as a cop going undercover in a racing gang led by Vin Diesel and finding himself drawn to the man he’s sworn to bring to justice — not to mention his sister (Jordana Brewster). In terms of box office clout, the more recent Furious clearly boasts higher octane, but the original was produced by a young Roger Corman. Call it a draw?The General&nbsp;1926 93%&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;1998 82%Buster Keaton’s silent classic and John Boorman’s gritty biopic are similar in exactly two ways: they’re both called The General, and they’re both in black and white. While Keaton’s film was a flop in its time, it’s subsequently been heralded as one of silent cinema’s greatest achievements; a deft mix of comedy and romance that features some of the most death-defying stunts ever captured on celluloid, the 1927 General is the story of a Civil War-era railroad engineer who rescues his girlfriend with the help of his beloved locomotive. In terms of historical import, Boorman’s film doesn’t measure up, but it’s still a remarkable portrait of Martin Cahill, a notorious Irish crime lord who became a modern folk hero; as played by Brendan Gleeson, Cahill maintains a roguish charm despite his propensity for violence, theft, and womanizing.Hero&nbsp;1992 67%&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;2002 94%At first glance, the two films here that share the title Hero could hardly be more different: one is a dramedy about an unassuming good Samaritan (Dustin Hoffman) who rescues several survivors from a crashed plane and promptly disappears back into anonymity, while the other is a period martial arts epic about an assassination plot against China’s first emperor. Digging a little deeper, however, reveals both movies were helmed by very good directors (Stephen Frears in 1992, Zhang Yimou in 2002), powered by very talented stars (Hoffman, Geena Davis, and Andy Garcia in 1992; Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Maggie Cheung, and Tony Leung in 2002), and effective in subverting traditional notions of heroism. That said, while Frears’ Hero was a moderate critical and commercial success, Zhang’s Hero is a triumph, with stunning action sequences, sumptuous cinematography, and a gripping story based on historical events.Notorious&nbsp;1946 96%&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;2009 52%Believe it or not, Alfred Hitchcock and Christopher Wallace have a lot in common. Both had multiple nicknames (Wallace rapped as both the Notorious B.I.G and Biggie Smalls; Hitchcock was called Hitch and the Master of Suspense). Both were known for their corpulent bodies. Both were involved in famous beefs (Biggie with 2Pac, Hitch with David O. Selznick). Both used art to reflect on the dark allure of crime and punishment. And though Hitch died before Biggie rose to fame, the rapper gave the great director a shout-out on “What’s Beef”: “This rap Alfred Hitchcock/ drop top notch playa hating won’t stop.” However, in the cinematic battle between Hitch’s espionage thriller and the Biggie biopic — both titled Notorious — the portly Englishman takes the top prize. While the latter received respectful to lukewarm notices, the former is one of Hitchcock’s greatest achievements — Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman burn up the screen as lovers on a mission to infiltrate a Nazi spy ring. And if you don’t know, now you know.The Protector&nbsp;1985 20%&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;2006 53%It’s not really fair to compare 1985’s The Protector to the film of the same name that came out 21 years later. We know that. Sure, it’s got the built-in headline power of “Jackie Chan vs. Tony Jaa,” but that’s more than a little disingenuous. When Chan starred in the earlier Protector, a self-serious thriller about an NYC cop (Chan) investigating a kidnapping, he was still virtually unknown to American audiences, so his signature stuntwork and comic energy is nowhere to be found in the film. By contrast, when 2002’s Protector opened, audiences were still feeling the incredible rush from Jaa’s explosive debut, Ong Bak; all eyes were on him to deliver another knockout, and deliver he did. One particular sequence involves a fantastic, brutal, unbroken long take following Jaa as he ascends several flights of stairs and beats up baddies, and that sequence alone trumps all of Chan’s Protector.Red&nbsp;1994 100%&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;2010 72%Two movies called Red are also two movies about old folks getting their respective mojos back. In the final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski’s Three Colors trilogy, Valentine (Irene Jacob) meets Joseph (Jean-Louis Trintignant), a reclusive retired judge, after she accidently runs over his dog. Joseph’s a pretty cynical old guy, but he eventually opens up to Valentine, who learns that he’s been secretly eavesdropping on his neighbors’ phone conversations. The folks in 2010’s Red are also getting up there in age, and they also know a thing or two about spycraft. Frank (Bruce Willis), Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich), and Victoria (Helen Mirren) are retired CIA operatives whose extensive institutional knowledge makes them dangerous to the agency. Though the more recent Red might not have garnered the critical praise of the 1994 film, it has lots more explosions. Like, lots more.Road House&nbsp;1948 100%&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;1989 39%The 1948 film Road House is bereft of the most compelling elements of its 1989 namesake — there are no nationally-famous bouncers, monster trucks, or early morning tai chi sessions to be found here. Instead, the O.G. Road House features a disturbing performance from Richard Widmark as Jeffy Robbins, the psychotic owner of a gritty tavern on the Canadian border. Jeffy is in love with lounge singer Lily Stevens (Ida Lupino), but she’s fallen for Jeffy’s Road House manager Pete Morgan (Cornel Wilde); frame-ups, double-crosses, and shootings ensue. This grim noir has a better Tomatometer than Rowdy Herrington’s magnum opus, but for campy fun, few films equal the 1989 film, which features Patrick Swayze at his most brutal and philosophical. Let it roll, baby, roll.Running Scared&nbsp;1979&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;1986 57%&nbsp;VS.&nbsp;&nbsp;2006 41%Running Scared is a fairly generic title, but this three-way battle’s plain surface masks some intriguing acting matchups — the 1979 version stars Ken Wahl and Judge Reinhold as Army vets who find themselves at the center of a spy thriller after unwittingly taking a picture of a secret military installation, the 1986 entry stars Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines as a couple of bumbling Chicago cops embroiled in a crime war with Jimmy Smits, and the 2005 Scared stars Paul Walker as a low-level Mafia grunt who’s told to dispose of a gun but ends up having to hunt it down after it’s “borrowed” and used to commit a crime. It’s definitely tough to pick a winner here — Walker is a repeat performer on this week’s list, and it’s hard to go against Judge Reinhold. But we have to go with the 1986 Running Scared, if for no other reason than the fact that the soundtrack’s Top 10 hit, “Sweet Freedom,” came with a video starring singer/ex-Doobie Brother/noted ’80s beard enthusiast Michael McDonald in a Hawaiian print shirt. Shine, sweet freedom… Shine your light on me…Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives (including last week’s Total Recall, in which we ran down other memorable movies with matching titles).

Of course, we knew we needed to dedicate this week’s list to recall — specifically, movies featuring protagonists who have lost their memory. Amnesia is a popular topic for filmmakers, leaving us with enough material to make this a special super-sized edition that features examples from pretty much every genre — and we’re still sure we managed to (ahem) “forget” at least one of your favorites. It’s the total partial recall you’ve been waiting for!Amateur 78%Amnesia can be a heartbreaking ordeal for the afflicted — or, in the case of Amateur‘s Thomas (Martin Donovan), a nifty way of having the reset button pushed on a life that’s gotten bogged down in bad decisions. Of course, as Thomas quickly discovers, the past has a way of catching up to you, even if you’re hiding from it in the arms of a nun-turned-pornographic writer (Isabelle Huppert). A surprising break from writer/director Hal Hartley’s early quirky romances, Amateur still found an appreciative audience with Hartley fans like ReelViews’ James Berardinelli, who wrote, “Certainly, the script fails to do much with the issue of confused identities, its ostensible theme, but Hartley’s style is such a pleasure to watch that it isn’t a major disadvantage for the substance to be weak.”Anastasia 92%When you don’t even know who you are, it can be awfully dangerous to fall in with the wrong crowd — which is possibly what’s befallen the young amnesiac (played by Ingrid Bergman) at the center of of Anatole Litvak’s Anastasia. Loosely based on a true story, it puts its young heroine at the center of a mystery: Is she really the lost Tsarina Anastasia, or just a patsy being manipulated by a Russian expat (Yul Brynner) with his own shadowy motives? The answer to the real-life question proved far less romantic than the film’s, but for Bosley Crowther of the New York Times, viewers got all the truth they needed on the screen: “Miss Bergman’s performance as the heroine is nothing short of superb,” he wrote, “as she traces the progress of a woman from the depths of derangement and despair through a struggle with doubt and delusion to the accomplishment of courage, pride and love.”The Bourne Identity 83%It seems laughable now, but before The Bourne Identity reached theaters, there were a lot of people who didn’t think Matt Damon had what it took to be a convincing action hero. Those doubts were quickly erased with director Doug Liman’s sleek, powerful adaptation of the Robert Ludlum novel — a huge box office hit that was powered with equal parts explosive set pieces and a solid central performance by its star. As it turned out, Damon had not only the dramatic chops to realistically portray the fear and confusion of an amnesiac who slowly begins to realize he’s a lethal assassin, but the physical presence to make audiences believe he could kill a man with a pen. The beginning of a trilogy so successful that it’s continuing without Damon, Bourne provided smart popcorn entertainment for critics like Peter Keough of the Boston Phoenix, who quipped, “Who needs an identity when you’re having this much fun?”Clean Slate 19%With The Bodyguard director Mick Jackson at the helm and SNL legend Dana Carvey in the lead, 1994’s Clean Slate should have been a smash hit. Alas, this putative comedy about a private investigator afflicted with a rare form of amnesia suffered from humiliating reviews and poisonous word of mouth, dooming its theatrical run. Starring as Maurice Pogue, a P.I. who survives an attempted murder but loses the ability to retain his memories of the previous day after going to sleep at night, Carvey was faced with the arduous task of wringing laughs from the screenplay by Robert King (Phantom of the Mall: Eric’s Revenge). Most critics found it forgettable in all the wrong ways, but for Clint Morris of Moviehole, who argued “Carvey’s great,” it was “A comedic Memento.”Curse of the Jade Scorpion 45%Woody Allen’s most expensive movie — and, perhaps not coincidentally, his least favorite of his own films — 2001’s The Curse of the Jade Scorpion takes your standard Allen starting point (stammering nebbish finds love with improbably attractive woman) and wraps it in a complicated plot involving a crooked magician, hypnosis-induced amnesia, and Dan Aykroyd. It all added up to a pretty lumpy blend, at least as far as most critics were concerned, and audiences couldn’t be bothered to find out whether or not they’d agree. Still, for a handful of scribes, Scorpion‘s sting was sweet: “This isn’t vintage Woody — we haven’t seen that since, oh, Hannah and Her Sisters — but it’s good enough,” argued Jean Lowerison of the San Diego Metropolitan.Desperately Seeking Susan 83%Incontrovertible proof that amnesia comedies and bustiers go together, Desperately Seeking Susan kicked off Madonna’s once-promising film career with the tale of a bored suburban housewife (Rosanna Arquette) who develops an obsession with a bleach-blonde free spirit named Susan (Madonna) and, through a series of unlikely events, ends up thinking she is Susan. Also, Egyptian jewelry is involved. It’s vintage ’80s cinema, from the shoulder pads in the wardrobes to the storyline’s reliance on madcap humor — but unlike most movies of its ilk, Susan resonated with most critics; as Dave Kehr admitted for the Chicago Reader, “The film acquires a pleasant, syncopated rhythm as it bounces from one unlikely event to another.”Dark City 76%The protagonist who has no memory of his past, but must find a way to evade capture for crimes he’s sure he didn’t commit: It’s a tale as old as noir, but Alex Proyas’ Dark City tells it with singularly stylish élan, starring Rufus Sewell as an unfortunate soul who wakes up in a bathtub, takes a phone call warning him that men are on their way to capture him, and stumbles across a dead woman on his way out the door. Toss in a city where the sun never shines, a human race prone to random comas, and a telekinetic battle between our hero and a shadowy cabal known as the Strangers, and Dark City is unlike any mindbending love story/trippy action thriller you’ve ever seen; as Stephen Holden argued in his review for the New York Times, it’s “so relentlessly trippy in a fun-house sort of way that it could very easily inspire a daredevil cult of moviegoers who go back again and again to experience its mind-bending twists and turns.”Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 92%While he spent the early 1990s mugging it up for fans of perfectly obvious comedy, few people could have guessed that Jim Carrey would wind up sharing top billing with one of the premier actresses of her generation in a mindbending, critically beloved drama about the nature of love and memory — but that’s exactly what he did in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, going toe to toe with Kate Winslet in one of the most unusual and eye-catching films of the early aughts. Armed with a script co-written by Charlie Kaufman, director Michel Gondry riddles the film with stunning visual effects that, depending on what you want out of the movie, either deepen its metaphorical layers of meaning or are simply really cool to look at. It’s admittedly too strange and/or chilly to appeal to everyone, but at its heart, the movie lives up to Mariko McDonald of Film Threat’s assessment of it as “fresh, heartfelt and ultimately heartbreaking in its honest portrayal of a modern relationship.”The Long Kiss Goodnight 70%Renny Harlin movies aren’t exactly known for their character development, and 1996’s Shane Black-scripted The Long Kiss Goodnight is no different — in a movie this obsessed with rapid-fire quips, explosions, and piled-up corpses, you root for the good guys and cheer for the disposal of cartoon villains. Case in point: David Morse’s Luke, a.k.a. Daedalus, an arms-dealing heavy who makes things difficult for the amnesiac CIA assassin played by Geena Davis — first he’s nasty, then he’s dead. But if Goodnight isn’t exactly thoughtful, or even particularly memorable, plenty of critics thought it was good, dumb fun — like Michael Dequina of The Movie Report, who asked, “Who can resist the sight of Davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car… while ice skating?”&nbsp;The Majestic 42%A sentimental ode to the films of Frank Capra — and to the magic of the cinema in general — Frank Darabont’s The Majestic was supposed to wrap audiences up in the heartwarming tale of a rising screenwriter (Jim Carrey) whose promising career is threatened by the HUAC hearings of the 1950s — and then derailed completely when he drunkenly careens off a bridge, loses his memory, and washes up on the shore of a small town where he’s mistaken for a long-lost World War II hero whose family just happens to own a dilapidated movie theater. Alas, most critics found The Majestic overlong and overly sentimental, but it found an appreciative audience with the New York Observer’s Rex Reed, who wrote, “Carrey gets the best role of his own career — and plays it with tenderness, valor, bravery and deeply moving conviction. I find him positively captivating.”The Manchurian Candidate 97%A pitch-black manifestation of Cold War political paranoia, John Frankenheimer’s The Manchurian Candidate tapped into the lethal turmoil of the post-WWII global landscape to frame the story of a soldier (Laurence Harvey) who’s captured during the Korean War and, along with his men (including Frank Sinatra), subjected to brainwashing by Communist agents. Back home, Harvey’s a war hero, but his programming — and the machinations of his politically ambitious mother (Angela Lansbury) — threaten to unleash dire consequences. The 2004 remake earned positive reviews, but there’s no substitute for the unbearably tense original; wrote Roger Ebert, “Not a moment of The Manchurian Candidate lacks edge and tension and a cynical spin.”Memento 93%The grim noir puzzle that reaffirmed Pearce’s leading-man talent and served as Christopher Nolan’s full-fledged Hollywood coming-out party, Memento offered an early glimpse of Nolan’s fondness for narrative games — as well as his ability to get the most out of his actors. Playing a man who spends most of the film as not only a mystery to the viewer, but to himself, Pearce won a pile of honors from various film critics’ circles, and was a major part of what led the Los Angeles Times’ Kenneth Turan to call Memento “provocatively structured and thrillingly executed film noir, an intricate, inventive use of cinema’s possibilities that pushes what can be done on screen in an unusual direction.”Mulholland Drive 83%It resists synopsis and analysis in characteristically Lynchian fashion, but whatever it may or may not actually be about, Mulholland Drive definitely includes scenes depicting a character who appears to be suffering from amnesia, so it would have been uncharitable to leave it off this list. As for the film itself, well, critics have been puzzling over its surreal imagery, nonlinear plot, and jumbled narrative since Mulholland arrived in theaters — but whether or not you can figure out what it all means, argued the New York Observer’s Andrew Sarris, it’s “One of the very few movies in which the pieces not only add up to much more than the whole, but also supersede it with a series of (for the most part) fascinating fragments.”Overboard 45%The hit 1980s comedy that argued that true happiness lies in leaving behind a life of luxury to do housework for a stranger and his four children, Overboard united real-life sweethearts Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell for a comedy about a haughty heiress who tries to cheat her carpenter out of payment for a job — then promptly falls off her yacht, loses her memory, and ends up becoming the unwitting pawn in his scheme to pass her off as his wife in order to exact revenge. It sounds like it could be the outline for a brutal psychological thriller — and a major portion of critics just thought it was generally no good — but for Time Out’s Nigel Floyd, Overboard was a “hilarious and touching romantic comedy” that triggered memories of “the integrated plotting and sophisticated dialogue of ’30s Hollywood.”Paris, Texas 97%Using the windswept desolation of rural Texas as a sort of visual representation of the loss felt by a man with no memory, Wim Wenders’ Paris, Texas follows the ambling trail of Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) after he emerges from the desert, collapses in a saloon, and is reconnected with his brother (Dean Stockwell) and estranged son (Hunter Carson). While far from the most mainstream offering on this week’s list, it might be one of the most emotionally affecting; as Luke Y. Thompson argued for New Times, “Wenders’ slow, moody style isn’t for everyone, but this is the epitome of it.”Spellbound 85%At Vermont’s Green Manors mental hospital, it’s hard to tell who’s more in need of therapy — the patients, or the new director (Gregory Peck), an eccentric fellow whose quickly multiplying quirks turn out to mask a case of amnesia that might have something to do with murder. This mid-period Hitchcock thriller rests on a series of coincidences — and seems to exhibit a rather hostile view of the psychology profession — but critics were mostly, well, spellbound by Spellbound; as John J. Puccio wrote for Movie Metropolis, “It may not be first-rank Hitchcock, but even second-tier Hitchcock is better than what most other directors produce.”Total Recall 82%Loosely based on Philip K. Dick’s short story “We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,” Total Recall placed peak-era Arnold Schwarzenegger square in the middle of a ruthlessly high-concept plot about a construction worker on a distant future version of Earth (or is he?) who pays for an exotic memory implant, changes his mind at the last minute, and suddenly finds himself at the center of a long-brewing political revolution on Mars (or does he?). Part thought-provoking sci-fi flick, part mindless FX extravaganza, Recall was a huge box office hit, spinning off a TV series, a scrapped sequel (which eventually morphed into Minority Report), and, of course, this week’s main feature. “Total Recall is too much,” admitted Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman, “but it’s too much of a good thing.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Alcon Entertainment has just the thing for you: Joyful Noise, the Queen Latifah/Dolly Parton musical drama about a newly instated small-town choir director (Latifah) whose battles with the former director’s widow (Parton) threaten to derail the choir’s performance in the annual Joyful Noise competition. In other words, we’ll get to see a rafter-raising musical number in the final act — which means we had no choice but to dedicate this week’s feature to a look back at some other movies that culminated in a Really Big Show. Whether they’re saving the orphanage or chasing a dream, the characters in these films have one thing in common: they all ended up on stage. Take your seats and turn off your cell phones, because it’s time for Total Recall!Babes in Arms 90%A Broadway hit for Rodgers and Hart in 1937, this gee-whiz musical centers on a group of vaudeville offspring (including Judy Garland and a positively frenetic Mickey Rooney) who want to put on a show of their own and make it to the big time. Garland and Rooney would follow this same basic plot outline enough times that we could probably just give them a Total Recall of their own, but Babes in Arms is the first and arguably best. “It’s saved by Rooney’s brash nerve,” wrote TV Guide, “and especially by the triple-threat charm of Garland, a performer unequaled in the annals of show business.”Be Kind Rewind 65%In this Michel Gondry cult favorite, a pair of buddies desperate to cover up the accidental destruction of the inventory at the VHS rental store where one of them works decide to start filming new versions starring themselves — a goofball enterprise they nickname “sweding,” after telling the customers the new versions came from Sweden. What starts as a stopgap measure soon becomes a profitable business venture, albeit one that’s quickly crushed by copyright law (and a steamroller). With the fate of their boss’s building on the line, the only thing left to do is get the whole neighborhood together for the most swedest sweded movie of all time. Unsurprisingly, the box office didn’t know quite what to make of Be Kind Rewind during its theatrical run, but it’s found an audience on home video among filmgoers who appreciate what James Rocchi called “a celebration of the power of film and the joy of the movies; not just great art, but also great trash.”The Blues Brothers 73%Jake and Elwood spend pretty much the entirety of The Blues Brothers careening around Illinois, one step ahead of the law, Nazis, and a bazooka-toting Carrie Fisher. What could be worth all that aggravation? Their mission from God — get the old band back together for one last performance, a benefit gig that will raise enough money to save the orphanage where they grew up. In the end, all that sweet soul music isn’t quite enough to offset the massive property damage they cause along the way, or to keep the brothers out of prison — but it does save the orphanage, and it certainly adds up to what Film4’s Richard Luck called “A damn fine mess of a movie.”The Full Monty 96%What can you do when you’re down on your luck in a town that seems to have run out of second chances? Swallow your pride, practice a few dance moves, hit the stage, and give the audience The Full Monty. This $257 million hit comedy follows the adventures of a group of unemployed steelworkers who decide to raise money by starting an all-male nude dance revue — a decision met with predictable resistance by some of their family members (to say nothing of local law enforcement), but ultimately ends up paying off with a sold-out show that culminates in what might be the most transcendent version of “You Can Leave Your Hat On” ever performed. “The Full Monty is feel-good comedy,” argued Russell Smith of the Austin Chronicle, “with none of the pejorative hints of innocuous blandness that term so often implies.”Hamlet 2 62%Rock me, sexy Jesus! Andrew Fleming’s Hamlet 2 is every bit as ridiculous as its title would imply, following a sad-sack high school drama instructor (Steve Coogan) who resorts to desperate measures after discovering that his program is due to be shut down at the end of the year. To save his job, he writes the highly un-anticipated sequel to Hamlet, featuring a number of inappropriate musical numbers, himself as Jesus, and lots of time travel. The zany end result involves an enraged principal, the interference of a zealous ACLU activist (Amy Poehler), and what Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman called “A high school musical that would make John Waters proud.”Hannah Montana: The Movie 43%Setting aside for a moment its ridiculous premise (a blonde wig is all it takes to fool people into thinking you’re someone different) and somewhat troubling message (living a double life is, like, totally cool), Hannah Montana: The Movie is perfect for this list — when not treating viewers to slapstick mistaken-identity plot twists and musical numbers, the plot hinges on the efforts of a group of evil developers to raze pristine Tennessee meadows and build a shopping mall. You know it’s going to come down to a big benefit concert, but you also don’t watch movies like this for surprises; as Linda Barnard wrote for the Toronto Star, “Who cares if it gives anyone over the age of 12 a headache? The state of Hannah Montana is little-girl paradise.”The Muppets 95%Technically, the Muppets have put on a couple of really big shows during their time in Hollywood, but for this list, we decided to go with 2011’s The Muppets, mainly because it felt so good to see them back on the big screen — and reuniting to save the old theater, which is where they truly belong. With musical numbers, feel-good optimism, and Muppets galore, it proved that nostalgia-driven entertainment doesn’t always have to feel like a step backward, and gave millions of thirtysomething parents an excuse to tear up in a darkened theater next to their children. Saying that it “marks a triumphant return for these beloved characters,” Aisle Seat’s Mike McGranaghan sighed, “This movie made me feel good all over.”School of Rock 92%Unlike most of the folks on this list, Dewey Finn (Jack Black) doesn’t have any altruistic motivations for putting on a show — he just really needs to pay his rent before he gets evicted, so he impersonates his roommate (Mike White) in order to take a job as a substitute teacher at a posh private school. He quickly realizes he has no idea what he’s doing, but he also realizes his students have real musical talent, and just as quickly sets about turning them into a band that can help him win the $20,000 prize in an upcoming local competition.School of Rock is pure formula, but in this case, that isn’t such a bad thing; as Jack Matthews wrote for the New York Daily News, “This is fun for everyone, even those (like me) who hate contemporary rock music.”Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit 19%Once Sister Act raked in a surprising $231 million at the box office, it was pretty much a foregone conclusion that we’d see a sequel. Alas, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit failed to spark the same level of critical goodwill — or commercial success — as its predecessor. Still, we’d be remiss if we ignored it here, as its plot is an unapologetic rehash of any random Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland musical (as previously mentioned): Delores Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg), who dodged the mob by pretending to be a nun in the first movie, is lured back into the convent in order to save her old friends’ school, which is facing closure by the diocese unless she can whip its choir (including a young Lauryn Hill) into shape. Its pure predictability caused many critics to groan in despair, but Entertainment Weekly’s Ty Burr didn’t mind, arguing, “Sister Act 2 doesn’t have one original idea in its entire 100 minutes. Somewhat bizarrely, it doesn’t matter.”Waiting for Guffman 91%Usually, the “really big show” movie ends in over-the-top triumph. Not so Waiting for Guffman, a Christopher Guest mockumentary about deluded director Corky St. Clair (played by Guest) and his increasingly desperate efforts to pull together a play in honor of a small Missouri town’s 150th anniversary. Given that much of the film’s dramatic tension hinges on the fact that Corky has told his largely talentless cast (which includes Catherine O’Hara, Fred Willard, and Parker Posey) that a Broadway producer named Guffman is coming to see the show, it would have been easy for Waiting to be mean — or simply rather sad. In the end, however, it’s smartly funny; as Roger Ebert wrote, “Attention is paid not simply to funny characters and punch lines, but to small nudges at human nature.”White Christmas 77%It might have been a transparent attempt to bundle some of Irving Berlin’s biggest hits with the Technicolor chemistry of a high-wattage quartet (Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Vera-Ellen), but 1954’s White Christmas is one of the most cheerfully corny entries in the “really big show” genre, loaded up with old-fashioned Hollywood charm and an impeccable soundtrack. Called upon to save a Vermont inn that’s on the brink of shutting down due to lack of snow, Broadway producers Crosby and Kaye decide to bring their hit production to town, setting in motion a flurry of star-crossed love affairs, musical numbers, and feel-good sentiment. “White Christmas is the cinema equivalent of an inappropriate festive snog under the mistletoe,” chuckled Wendy Ide of the UK’s Times. “You know you probably shouldn’t enjoy it but you just can’t help yourself.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

But did you know Cameron wasn’t the first to sink the ship?For this week’s Total Recall we present the long cinematic legacy the Titanic has left in its wake.Ghostbusters II 53%When they finally got around to writing the screenplay for Ghostbusters II, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis found themselves faced with the unenviable task of dreaming up a climactic battle that would somehow surpass the original’s. It’s generally accepted that they fell short of that mark, but give them credit — instead of bringing back the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (or using two of him), they dreamed up an over-the-top FX extravaganza that included the ghost of Mayor La Guardia, an entire building covered in pink slime, and a ghost-filled Titanic sailing into the harbor. While conceding that the movie was “Hammered together out of the junkiest of elements,” the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson enjoyed the way it “rattles along with a pleasing rambunctiousness, tossing off its quips and one-liners and scoring on a remarkably high percentage of them.”A Night to Remember 100%Nearly 40 years before Kate and Leo went down with the ship, screenwriter Eric Ambler and director Roy Ward Baker assembled this painstaking adaptation of Walter Lord’s non-fiction tome about the shipwreck. Using blueprints from the ship — and with Titanic fourth officer Joseph Boxhall on board as a technical advisor — A Night to Remember set out to give audiences the most realistic and historically accurate recreation of the crash ever brought to the screen. According to critics, they not only succeeded, they beat the odds and added a gripping drama in the bargain; as Bosley Crowther of the New York Times, wrote, “though the tragic story of the sinking of the Titanic is an old and oft-repeated one, it still makes for tense, exciting and supremely awesome drama on the screen.”Raise the Titanic 38%Put together the Cold War and one of the world’s most famous shipwrecks, and what do you have? This waterlogged adaptation of the Clive Cussler bestseller about the discovery of “byzanium,” a rare mineral that can help America defeat the Soviet Union once and for all — but only if we can wrest it from the wreckage of the Titanic before they do. A flop so costly it was said to have driven producer Lew Grade out of the film business — and so poorly reviewed that it forever soured Cussler on the idea of having anyone turn one of his books into a movie — Raise the Titanic could only muster a sigh from Roger Ebert, who called it “almost a good movie.”Time Bandits 90%One of Terry Gilliam’s more breezily fantastical (and, perhaps not coincidentally best-reviewed) films, Time Bandits doesn’t spend as much time on board the Titanic as some of the other entries on this list — but we would have been remiss if we’d compiled it without at least mentioning the brief interlude that the time-traveling Kevin (Craig Warnock) and his diminutive friends spend on the ship before realizing it’s sailing for a watery grave. “This is the only live-action movie I’ve seen that literally looks like pages out of Heavy Metal magazine,” grinned an appreciative Roger Ebert.Titanic (1943) 60%Long before James Cameron broke Hollywood budget records with his own Titanic, this 1943 production did the same for Germany — a consequence of an out-of-control set that resulted in the arrest (and “suicide”) of its original director. Produced as a piece of Nazi propaganda, this Titanic uses the crash as a demonstration of capitalist greed, presenting the ship’s poor German passengers as the story’s only real heroes; still, after a brief theatrical run, it was banned by Joseph Goebbels and languished in obscurity for years. “As filmmaking, it’s not much to get excited about,” observed Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain Xpress, “but as a curio, it’s something else again.”Titanic (1953) 91%Poor Richard Sturges (Clifton Webb). Not only has his wife Julia (Barbara Stanwyck) run off and boarded the Titanic’s maiden voyage without him, but once he finally does finagle his way onto the ship, she tells him she wants a divorce — and that he isn’t really the father of their son. Oh, and then the boat hits an iceberg and sinks. But at least the end result won an Academy Award, not to mention the approval of critics like James Sanford of the Kalamazoo Gazette, who deemed it an “Exciting, well-acted version of the infamous voyage.”Titanic (1997) 89%It wasn’t the first Titanic film — or even the first one named Titanic — but James Cameron’s iceberg-bound love story certainly struck a chord with audiences, setting sail to the tune of more than $1.8 billion in worldwide grosses. And it’s a good thing, too: at $200 million, it set a new record for the most expensive film ever made, causing many an ulcer on the Fox executive board (and ultimately earning Cameron a hefty chunk of money through his percentage of the profits). And oh by the way, while audiences were filing into the 194-minute Titanic in droves, critics were lining up to give it praise — including Newsweek’s David Ansen, who called it “big, bold, touchingly uncynical filmmaking.”The Unsinkable Molly Brown 78%To use a real-life tragedy as the framing device for a musical comedy about American social mores — and to use the word Unsinkable in the title — is undoubtedly a little crass, but the Broadway hit The Unsinkable Molly Brown made up for it by being too generally charming and good-natured to get upset about, and on the big screen, it benefited from having Debbie Reynolds in the title role. True, most Titanic movies don’t include pie fights or songs like “I Ain’t Down Yet,” but as A.H. Weiler of the New York Times observed, “For all of its shallowness, Molly is a cheerful and entertaining addition to the local screen scene.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

But that doesn’t mean this adaptation is wholly without precedent — from cops to spies to bootleggers and everything in between, action series like 21 Jump Street have been crossing over to the big screen for decades, and this week, we’re holstering our weapons, revving our tricked-out custom wheels, and striking a series of “spontaneous” poses during the opening credits before we count down some noteworthy examples of TV action heroes who got their own movies. It’s time for Total Recall!The A-Team 49%After more than a decade in development, the big-screen version of Stephen J. Cannell’s masterpiece of 1980s action cheese finally gunned its way into theaters, complete with an excellent cast that included Liam Neeson, Bradley Cooper, and Sharlto Copley. With all that time and talent — not to mention Smokin’ Joe Carnahan, one of Hollywood’s most action-friendly directors, at the helm — how could the 2010 edition of The A-Team go wrong? In a lot of ways, as it turned out; according to most critics, the movie was too loud, too hectic, and too poorly written to serve as a proper homage to the long-running NBC hit. But the reviews weren’t all bad: Nick Curtis of the London Evening Standard was one of the critics who enjoyed it, saying, “Joe Carnahan’s movie is loud and vulgar and disorienting, but also an exhilarating kind of fun.”Charlie’s Angels 68%Nearly 20 years after the franchise jiggled its way off TV, Drew Barrymore — attached as producer and star — brought Charlie’s Angels to a whole new generation with her big-budget, impeccably cast version of the series that launched a million bedroom posters. With McG behind the cameras, and Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu kicking bad guy butt alongside Barrymore, the new-look Angels racked up nearly $265 million in worldwide grosses and spawned a sequel, 2003’s less enthusiastically received Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle. According to Kirk Honeycutt of the Hollywood Reporter, “The good-natured humor of its three stars, who appear to be having a gas playing these ridiculous figures, goes a long way in overcoming the bad jokes and even worse plot twists.”Dragnet 51%For decades, Jack Webb’s Dragnet was an institution, enjoying a long radio run before moving onto the television airwaves during the 1950s and 1960s — and, in the process, becoming one of the most influential dramas in history. Webb created the show, produced it, frequently directed, and starred as the iconic Sergeant Joe Friday; he also directed the first big-screen Dragnet, released in 1956. It was not a critical smash — the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther sniffed, “Just what it is this one crime thriller has that has caused it to be the darling of television chair-sleuths comes through but faintly on the wide screen” — but it retained a lot more of the show’s spirit than the 1987 version, which took a comedic approach and starred TV Dragnet vet Harry Morgan opposite Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks. Of the latter, Mark R. Leeper scoffed, “One wonders how someone can do so many parodies as Aykroyd has and still not have the slightest idea of how to do a parody.”The Dukes of Hazzard 14%A thinly disguised spinoff of the 1975 film Moonrunners, the hit CBS series The Dukes of Hazzard was never regarded as, shall we say, particularly intelligent entertainment. It was harmlessly cheesy fun, the rootin’ tootin’ adventures of some good ol’ boys who never meant no harm and were just makin’ their way the only way they knew how — which was, unfortunately just a little bit more than the law would allow. In other words, it should have been relatively easy to make an entertaining Dukes movie in 2005, especially with an eclectic cast that included Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Burt Reynolds, and an exuberantly short-shorted Jessica Simpson. Alas, although it broke $100 million at the box office, the Dukes movie was lambasted by critics like Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post, who lamented it as “So loud, so long, so dumb.”The Fugitive 96%The Fugitive lasted only four seasons during its TV run, but they cast a long, influential shadow — and they provided a strong platform for screenwriters Jeb Stuart and David Twohy when Warner Bros. decided to bring the show to the big screen. Starring Harrison Ford as Richard Kimble, the doctor forced to go on the run to prove his innocence in the murder of his wife, and Tommy Lee Jones as the U.S. Marshal determined to track him down, 1993’s The Fugitive was a huge critical and commercial hit, racking up nearly $370 million at the box office and enjoying raves from critics like TIME’s Richard Schickel, who deemed it “A first-rate thriller.” Less successful was 1998’s spinoff picture U.S. Marshals, which found Jones returning to the role to far less captivating effect. Cautioned Noel Murray for the Nashville Scene, “A team of federal cops catching crooks is the stuff of weekly TV shows, not motion-picture spectaculars.”I Spy 16%It broke new racial ground, but in terms of its concept, I Spy was pretty standard stuff — the secret agent adventures of an undercover tennis player (Robert Culp) and his trainer (Bill Cosby) as they traipsed around the world stopping bad guys. The secret of its Emmy-winning success was the abundant chemistry between Culp and Cosby — not to mention the sharp writing. All of the above was lost in translation when the show made its way to theaters in 2002, despite a small army of screenwriters and the star power of Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy. The problem, according to Ed Park of the Village Voice: “Though ample time is spent mingling Murphy’s jabberjaw locutions and Wilson’s curveball spaciness, the film leaves only the bitter reek of a botched chemistry experiment.”&nbsp;Miami Vice 46%Unlike most of the movies on this list, the 2006 edition of Miami Vice boasted the involvement of its television counterpart’s creator: Michael Mann, who directed the big-screen adaptation and should have given it a leisure-suited leg up on the competition — in theory, anyway. In practice, Mann’s Miami Vice movie missed the mark, despite his typically absorbing visual style and a top-shelf cast that included Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx subbing in for Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. “The film, like its oddly rumbling sky, promises more than it ever delivers,” sighed Lisa Kennedy of the Denver Post. “Granted, it can look cool. But more often, as we wait for the lightning that never arrives, it frustrates.”Mission: Impossible 66%Suave secret agents, dangerous missions in exotic locales, impossible cool spy gadgets — it’s no wonder Mission: Impossible has captivated the imagination for so long, first as a seven-season hit on CBS during the 1960s and 1970s, then again during a short-lived reboot in 1988-1990, and finally as the blockbuster franchise that has seen Tom Cruise repeatedly saving the world under the aegis of some of Hollywood’s most talented directors. (As of this writing, the series helmers include Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, and Brad Bird — and over $2 billion in worldwide grosses.) And even after four installments, the franchise is still going strong: 2011’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol enjoyed the best reviews of all, ending up with 93 percent on the Tomatometer and breathless praise from critics like Tom Long of the Detroit News, who called it “top-notch popcorn entertainment, chock-full of dazzling stunts and heroic moments, played out at a near-hysterical pitch.”The Mod Squad 3%During its 1968-73 run on ABC, The Mod Squad was not only a moderate hit, it could be argued that the show was actually important: with its hippies-solving-crimes formula and a focus on multicultural storylines, it helped make the counterculture safe for mainstream American audiences. But it was also very much a product of its time (example: the cringeworthy promo tagline “One White, One Black, One Blonde”), and when MGM decided to give the Squad a new look with 1999’s Scott Silver-directed movie, the results were disastrous. Despite an attractive cast led by Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, and Omar Epps, the updated Mod Squad petered out at 4 percent on the Tomatometer, thanks to what the Palo Alto Weekly’s Jim Shelby called “a pristine example of incoherent storyline mixed with poor editing and limp writing.”The Saint 30%On TV, The Saint was an enormous UK hit that wowed audiences across the globe while proving that Roger Moore was more than capable of dashing derring-do. But nearly 30 years later, when the series arrived in theaters with Val Kilmer playing the titular globe-trotting detective, the magic had worn off; the 1997 Saint, directed by Phillip Noyce, broke $100 million in global box office receipts, but failed to break even with its domestic gross — and it was dismissed by critics like Salon’s Charles Taylor, who called it “A soulless piece of claptrap.”Starsky and Hutch 62%During the mid-to-late 1970s, David Starsky and Kenneth “Hutch” Hutchinson were two of the coolest cops on TV — heck, even their informant, Huggy Bear, almost ended up getting his own spinoff series, and “Hutch,” a.k.a. David Soul, managed to score a number one pop single with “Don’t Give Up on Us” during the second year of the series’ four-season run. By 2004, when Todd Phillips directed the Starsky &amp; Hutch movie, it all looked a little silly; hence, an adaptation that turned a hit cop thriller into a Frat Pack comedy. Still, even if the big-screen Starsky forsook its TV roots, critics found it hard to argue with the results; as Mark Halverson of the Sacramento News &amp; Review put it, “The film is as clever as it is silly, more warmhearted than sentimental and just as irreverent as it is nostalgic.”S.W.A.T. 48%It ran for only two seasons and 37 episodes, but who needs a long-running series when you have characters with names as awesome as Hondo and Deacon? Not S.W.A.T., the ’70s action thriller that was reborn in 2003 as a would-be big-screen franchise starring Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, and Jeremy Renner. Despite packing enough heat to earn over $200 million at the box office, it never spawned a sequel (unless you count the direct-to-video S.W.A.T.: Firefight, released eight years later), but it did win the admiration of critics like Peter Rainer of New York Magazine, who begrudgingly admitted, “There is something sneakily gratifying about all this.”The Untouchables 83%The story of Eliot Ness’ crusade to bring Al Capone to justice has proven remarkably fertile ground for Hollywood, spinning off two TV series (1959-63 and 1993-94) as well as Brian De Palma’s Oscar-winning 1987 film. It’s easy to see why — everyone loves to see a real good guy bring a bad guy down, and knowing it was inspired by one of the most high-profile criminal cases in United States history only adds to the high-stakes drama — but it’s still worth noting that the 1987 Untouchables is one of the most solidly acted and slickly directed crime movies of the late 1980s. “The end result can easily pass as mindless mainstream entertainment, but make no mistake,” cautioned Jeremy Heilman of Movie Martyr. “The Untouchables is one of De Palma’s most trenchant statements about the state of America.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

And then there’s Steven Soderbergh: restless, eclectic, award-winning, and equally at home in the arthouse and the megaplex. With Haywire, Soderbergh is aiming squarely for the latter, but bringing his own unique style to the ever-popular action genre — and making this week’s Total Recall the perfect place to look back at some of his brightest critical highlights! 79%10. Che: Part Two (Guerrilla)A year after concluding the Ocean’s trilogy, Soderbergh turned his attention to a sprawling, nearly five-hour biopic of iconic revolutionary/unintentional t-shirt model Che Guevara. Originally spearheaded by Terrence Malick but abandoned when funding fell through, Che made waves on the festival circuit — where star Benicio del Toro won a Best Actor trophy at Cannes — but even split into two chapters, it had little more than niche appeal to mainstream American filmgoers. For those who dared brave its imposing length, however, critics promised an experience worth the investment. As Peter Bradshaw wrote for the Guardian, “Che Two is deeply impressive: austerely confident, coherent and mysterious.” 83%9. Ocean’s ElevenGlamour is a big part of what used to make going to the movies so much fun — and thanks to a variety of factors, not least the rising tide of paparazzi journalism, the wonderful spectacle of Hollywood’s brightest stars has lost a great deal of its wattage over the last decade and change. Soderbergh managed to turn back the clock a little with his 2001 remake of the minor 1960 Rat Pack classic, lining up a cast of heavyweights so impressive that even the most jaded filmgoers couldn’t help but give in to the spectacle. Critics were suitably dazzled, too, noting that the fun being had onscreen by George Clooney (as the titular Danny Ocean) and his luminous co-stars (including Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts) was too infectious to resist. Writing for the Philadelphia Weekly, Sean Burns applauded, “It’s a giant ice-cream cake of a movie that tickles the pleasure centers of your brain — restoring the good name of large-scale, old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment.” 84%8. Erin BrockovichSoderbergh earned a slew of Golden Globe and Academy Awards nominations — including Best Picture and Best Director nominations at the Oscars — for this fact-based courtroom drama about a legal file clerk (Julia Roberts) who discovered that a town’s public utility company was poisoning its water supply, and continued to pursue the case until justice was served. Roberts’ Brockovich performance cleaned up at the awards circuit, winning her Best Actress honors from SAG, BAFTA, the Golden Globes, and the Oscars — and the film was a hit with audiences as well as critics, earning more than $250 million at the box office while bringing praise from critics like Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune, who called it “One of the gutsiest, most exciting, and most satisfying courtroom docudramas ever, one that genuinely lifts the spirits as you watch it.” 85%7. ContagionMovies about virus epidemics are nothing new — who can forget Dustin Hoffman saving the world from a monkey virus in Outbreak? — but Soderbergh gave the genre a fresh, chilly twist with Contagion. Using an Altman-worthy assortment of famous faces, including Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Soderbergh depicted the deadly spread of the illness with what some critics felt was overly clinical precision, but as far as most writers were concerned, its lack of colorful melodrama was precisely the point. “The most terrifying aspect of Contagion, ultimately, is the plausibility of its premise,” wrote Jeanette Catsoulis for NPR. “Meticulous and low-key, the film reminds us that disaster lies in the most mundane interactions.” 91%6. And Everything Is Going FineSpalding Gray was a singular talent, and after his mysterious death (ruled a suicide) in 2004, Soderbergh set about giving him a singular biopic. The result: 2010’s And Everything Is Going Fine, which uses judiciously edited performance footage to tell Gray’s story in his own words. Its theatrical run was mostly restricted to the festival circuit (including screenings at Slamdance and SXSW), but even if it wasn’t one of Soderbergh’s more commercial efforts, it gave the director a chance to show a rarely-seen side of his artistry. “This is not a standard bio-documentary,” wrote Misha Berson of the Seattle Times. “It is the artist giving us a guided tour of himself, through a mosaic of clips from his shows and TV interviews, craftily assembled by Soderbergh.” 92%5. TrafficOne of the more darkly ambitious films to make its way through the studio system over the last decade, Soderbergh’s Traffic looks at the human cost of the drug trade by following seemingly unconnected stories that slowly converge. In Mexico, a police officer (Benicio del Toro) becomes the unwitting employee of a drug lord; in San Diego, a major dealer (Miguel Ferrer) is targeted by a pair of DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman); and in the Midwest, a crusading judge (Michael Douglas) finds his black-and-white views on drugs challenged when his teenage daughter (Erika Christensen) develops a cocaine addiction. In condensing the six-part BBC series Traffik, Soderbergh had to trim some of the original’s heft, but Traffic was still a four-time Academy Award winner (including Best Director) as well as one of the best-reviewed films of the year, thanks to critics like Andrew Sarris of the New York Observer, who proclaimed, “The promise of Sex, Lies, and Videotape has been fulfilled.” 92%4. The LimeySoderbergh followed the critical and commercial triumph of Out of Sight with The Limey, a gritty neo-noir showcase for the talent of leading man Terence Stamp. Here, Stamp plays Wilson, a British ex-con hellbent on bloody revenge for the death of his daughter. Surrounded by an ace cast that included Peter Fonda, Lesley Ann Warren, and Luis Guzman, Stamp led The Limey to some of the year’s best reviews — including an enthusiastic endorsement from the San Francisco Chronicle’s Edward Guthmann, who called it “a first-rate crime thriller and further proof that director Stephen Soderbergh is one of our great contemporary film stylists.” 93%3. Out of SightWith his adaptation of Elmore Leonard’s bestselling novel, Soderbergh could have created just another heist flick, but Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney’s chemistry, along with Scott Frank’s razor-sharp screenplay, takes it to another level. As Sisco, Lopez gets to alternate between tough and vulnerable, all while being lovingly lit by Soderbergh and cinematographer Elliot Davis; meanwhile, Clooney’s screen presence fully evolves here from “moonlighting TV star” to “certified leading man.” As Radheyan Simonpillai noted in his review for AskMen.com, “Soderbergh finds the perfect equilibrium between mainstream entertainment and arty panache, lacing this heist movie/romantic comedy with character-motivated time shifting, prominent freeze-frames, a funky soundtrack and an all-around hip vibe.” 91%2. King of the HillAfter the relative disappointment of 1991’s Kafka, Soderbergh bounced back (critically speaking, anyway) with his next picture, 1993’s King of the Hill. With a script Soderbergh adapted from A.E. Hotchner’s memoir, Hill tells the tale of a Depression-era teenager (played by Jesse Bradford) who whiles his time in a fleabag St. Louis hotel while his father works the road as a traveling salesman and his mother is treated for tuberculosis. Not the cheeriest stuff, and hardly blockbuster material, but it impressed most of the critics who saw it — including James Berardinelli of ReelViews, who called it “a remarkable odyssey about a resilient young hero who uses both his imagination and his sense of reality to survive.” 96%1. sex, lies, and videotapeThe DNA of the 1990s indie film boom can be traced back directly to Soderbergh’s debut, which took a deceptively simple premise — four people talking about their relationships — and turned it into a Palme d’Or winner that essentially made Miramax a viable studio. Viewed through modern eyes, it may not seem like much more than a series of well-acted conversations, but at the time, sex, lies, and videotape was a breath of fresh air that Hollywood desperately needed — and, as the New York Times’ Caryn James put it, “a film whose enormous authority and intelligence extend to every detail.”In case you were wondering, here are Soderbergh’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Traffic — 81%2. Schizopolis — 79%3. King of the Hill — 77%4. Ocean’s Eleven — 76%5. Erin Brockovich — 76%6. Che: Part One (The Argentine) — 75%7. The Limey — 75%8.

But all that was merely a prelude for this weekend, when McAvoy suits up as the mighty (and decidedly wheelchair-free) Charles Xavier in X-Men: First Class. With a starring role in one of the summer’s most highly anticipated films under his belt, we thought it was about time to take a look at some of the brightest spots in McAvoy’s filmography, Total Recall style. Let’s get started! 55%10. Gnomeo and JulietIn early 2011, McAvoy entered the world of family-friendly 3D CGI with Gnomeo &amp; Juliet, in which squabbling clans of garden gnomes re-enact the classic Shakespeare tragedy to the strains of Elton John’s greatest hits. An odd blend, right down to a voice cast that included McAvoy, Michael Caine, Jason Statham, Ozzy Osbourne, and Hulk Hogan — but it got a smile out of critics like Film School Rejects’ Robert Levin, who called it “The greatest film ever made about living, breathing garden gnomes.” 58%9. Becoming JaneNobody did star-crossed love like Jane Austen, so it’s only fitting that, with 2007’s Becoming Jane, the endlessly screen-friendly author got to have a forbidden love affair of her own. The movie’s casual relationship with historical fact — not to mention Anne Hathaway’s unsteady accent in the starring role — was a source of consternation for some, but whatever its flaws, Jane gave audiences a peek at the unconsummated love that might have existed between Austen and the young lawyer Thomas Lefroy. Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was one of its supporters, calling it “An evocative portrait of an artistic temperament in defiance of propriety and of how, when such things are repressed, passion and personality are revealed in acts of private ritual and public performance.” 61%8. WimbledonWimbledon really belonged to Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst, but McAvoy notched a scene-stealing supporting turn in this 2004 romantic comedy, playing Bettany’s obnoxiously funny brother (and getting some of the movie’s best lines in the process). Although filmgoers weren’t particularly interested in watching a love story blossom on the tennis court, most critics thought Wimbledon was a pretty good match — including Rick Kisonak of Film Threat, who wrote, “You aren’t likely to see a film with more warmth and good humor anytime soon, or one that does more to give feel good filmmaking a good name.” 65%7. Bright Young ThingsMulti-hyphenate talent Stephen Fry made his directorial debut with this ensemble period drama, which adapts Evelyn Waugh’s novel Vile Bodies, about the exploits of well-to-do young Londoners during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. Overstuffed to a fault, Bright Young Things alternately delighted and confounded critics who found it difficult to draw a common thread between its chaotic jumble of plots and an eclectic, unwieldy cast that included McAvoy, Michael Sheen, Jim Broadbent, Peter O’Toole, and Dan Aykroyd. “The episodic structure gets more unwieldy as the story progresses,” observed Steve Schneider of the Orlando Weekly, “but there’s still room for some rewarding dalliances.” 71%6. The Last StationThe last days of Leo Tolstoy may not seem like the most obvious inspiration for a movie, but what The Last Station lacks in marquee sparkle, it makes up in opportunities for its talented cast to showcase their prodigious gifts. McAvoy co-stars here as part of an impressive ensemble that includes Paul Giamatti, Helen Mirren, and Christopher Plummer, as the dying author whose legacy sparks the battle at the heart of the plot. Even for a low-budget independent feature, Station underperformed at the box office, failing to recoup its budget, but most critics thought it was worth a look. “If you come to this expecting the philosophical depth and psychological detail of Tolstoy’s work you’re sure to be disappointed,” wrote J.R. Jones of the Chicago Reader, “but as an actors’ romp it’s delectable.” 71%5. WantedMcAvoy’s Everyman appeal came in handy for this adaptation of the Mark Millar comic book series, which follows the evolution of an office drone (McAvoy) who finds himself unexpectedly recruited by a shadowy network of assassins called The Fraternity (whose members include Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman). Thoroughly unhinged from reality, but bursting at the seams with eyebrow-raising action sequences, Wanted lived up to its title at the box office, where it raked in more than $340 million — and it didn’t do too badly with critics, either. Cole Smithey joined the chorus of applause for the film, writing, “You’ll come for the action; you’ll enjoy it more because of James McAvoy.” 76%4. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeMcAvoy took a role among the star-studded supporting cast of this big-budget, family-friendly adaptation of the C.S. Lewis classic, appearing as Mr. Tumnus, a faun who leaves the court of the White Witch to fight with the friends of Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson). It may not have afforded McAvoy the most screen time he’d ever seen, but it did give him an opportunity to be part of a $745 million blockbuster that brought a beloved book to the screen — and earned the approval of critics like the Atlantic City Weekly’s Lori Hoffman, who wrote, “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a fable that captures a fully realized landscape of honor, love, sacrifice, betrayal and forgiveness.” 83%3. AtonementDirector Joe Wright turned Ian McEwen’s bestselling novel into an Academy Award-winning film with this 2007 adaptation, starring Saoirse Ronan and Keira Knightley as Briony and Cecilia Tallis, a pair of sisters living in 1930s England whose relationship is forever altered after Briony makes an impetuous (and false) allegation against Cecilia’s boyfriend (McAvoy). Offering war, teary-eyed romance, and period sweep, Atonement instantly marked Ronan as one to watch, and although a substantial number of critics felt it didn’t match the power of the book, most thought it came close enough, and the Orlando Sentinel’s Roger Moore went so far as to call it “A film that instantly joins the ranks of the great screen romances.” 87%2. The Last King of ScotlandIt’s often said that the greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn’t exist, but sometimes we can convince ourselves even if we can see the devil staring right at us. That’s the moral of The Last King of Scotland, the story of a Scottish doctor (McAvoy) who finds himself seduced by the charisma and opulent wealth of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker), rationalizing the regime’s horrific brutality until it’s impossible to ignore — and almost impossible to escape. McAvoy took home a Best Supporting Actor BAFTA nomination for his work, Whitaker netted the Best Actor Oscar, and the film earned unqualified praise from critics like Heather Huntington of ReelzChannel, who wrote, “This isn’t just a moral cause movie for New Yorker-reading smartypants to brag to their friends that they saw to show how in-the-know they are. The Last King of Scotland deserves every good thing that has been said about it, and then some.” 90%1. Starter for 10Screenwriter David Nicholls adapted his own novel for this low-key 2006 coming-of-age dramedy, which follows a British university student (McAvoy) as he struggles to reconcile his college life with his working-class roots — and tries to choose between a pair of impossibly beautiful love interests (Alice Eve and Rebecca Hall). While certainly built with familiar ingredients, Starter for 10 earned critical praise for its sweetly sentimental tone, funny script, and likable cast; as Michael Szymanski wrote for Hollywood.com, it’s “Pure feel-good romantic nostalgia, whether you lived in 1980’s London or not.”In case you were wondering, here are McAvoy’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1.

Ellis (The Final Destination), we get to bid it adieu in the most appropriate fashion: by lining up to watch scantily clad twentysomethings futilely splash around in abject terror while trying to escape from bloodthirsty sharks. Yes, that’s right, it’s time for Shark Night 3D, and to celebrate its finny arrival, we decided to devote this week’s list to Hollywood’s hunters of the deep. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, it’s time for Total Recall — Deadly Sea Creatures edition!The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms 95%Twenty thousand fathoms is deep. It would take a lot to wake up a creature frozen at those icy depths — like, say, a nuclear bomb set off by our reckless, explosion-hungry army — and once disturbed from its slumber, said creature would probably be pretty annoyed. In fact, as demonstrated in the aptly titled The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, it might even be ticked off enough to swim all the way from the Arctic Circle to Manhattan — where it would cause hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, take a bazooka to the throat, kill hundreds of New Yorkers with rivers of its poisonous blood, and still keep fighting. No nukes! Or, as Dennis Schwartz put it: “Lovable bad sci-fi film that overcomes its slight story and flat acting with wonderful cheesy special effects.”Creature from the Black Lagoon 78%One of the original 3D creature features, 1954’s Creature from the Black Lagoon made a persuasive argument against letting scientists go off on unsupervised expeditions — like the one that the allegedly brilliant Dr. Carl Maia (Antonio Moreno) leads into the Amazon, where he persists in horsing around looking for fossils even after members of his team are mysteriously murdered. And then, if that weren’t foolhardy enough, he sails into a place called the Black Lagoon — after his guide tells him no one has ever returned from it. After all that, it’s sort of hard not to root for the watery, web-fingered Creature — or to keep from cheering along with the Chicago Reader’s Dave Kehr, who smirked, “[Director] Jack Arnold has a flair for this sort of thing, and if there really is anything frightening about a man dressed up in a rubber suit with zippers where the gills ought to be, Arnold comes close to finding it.”Deep Blue Sea 59%Strictly speaking, there probably wasn’t any need for a movie about super-smart sharks. But hey, if you’re going to make one, you might as well hire Renny Harlin to direct and cast a reliable cadre of action vets like Samuel L. Jackson, Thomas Jane, and LL Cool J. Example: 1999’s Deep Blue Sea, starring Saffron Burrows as an unscrupulous scientist/wacky shark breeder whose attempts to cure Alzheimer’s unwittingly trigger all manner of bloody havoc. “Call it silly,” offered the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick LaSalle. “Call it obvious — there’s nothing more obvious than a shark attack. But this is one of the few big-fish horror films that still has the power to surprise.”Gojira 93%He does most of his damage on land, but the spiny-backed beast with radioactive breath came from the sea — where he was quite happy, thank you very much, until we had to go and disturb him with a nuclear explosion. Although he’d go on to star in a series of creature features — and is slated to return with a reboot in 2014 — it’s the 1954 original that still resonates strongest. Half rubber-suited sci-fi thriller, half poignant metaphor for the horror of the Atomic Age, Gojira deserves its status as a classic of the genre — and the applause of critics like Gemma Tarlach of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, who lauded it as “a masterful statement about humankind’s monstrous abilities to inflict harm on itself and the world.”The Host 93%Recipe for one (1) horrifying, snakelike aquatic plague: 1. Take 200 bottles of formaldehyde; 2. Dump them in the river; 3. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH IT’S DRAGGING ME TO THE WATERY DEPTHS. Inspired by actual events (which did not, for the record, involve an actual sea monster), 2006’s The Host shattered box office records in its native South Korea before going on to wow audiences in the rest of the world — and critics such as Dana Stevens of Slate, who wrote, “The movie pops up out of nowhere, grabs you in its big, messy tentacles, and drags you down into murky depths, where social satire coexists with slapstick, and B-movie clichés mutate into complex metaphors.”It Came from Beneath the Sea 56%Take a heaping helping of nuclear paranoia, add a dash of Ray Harryhausen magic for seasoning, and you’ve got 1955’s It Came from Beneath the Sea, in which a giant octopus torments San Francisco after hydrogen bomb tests turn it into an enraged super-beast whose radioactive tentacles destroy the Golden Gate Bridge. It takes the heroic efforts of an intrepid submarine commander (and, ironically, a nuclear torpedo) to bring the movie’s many-suckered antagonist down — an inevitable defeat that was sort of a shame, according to critics like DVD Verdict’s Erick Harper, who wrote that “The rest of the film — plot, characters, script, and so forth — is really just window dressing in this showcase for Harryhausen’s amazing stop-motion puppetry.”Jaws 98%Who’s the great white shark that’s a death machine to all the guys and chicks? (Jaws!) You’re damn right. The only deadly sea creature bad enough to be identified with a mere two notes of its classic score, Jaws splashed forth from the pages of Peter Benchley’s bestselling novel to terrorize audiences everywhere — and although the toothy legend’s adventures grew progressively sillier with subsequent sequels, there’s no denying that the original is, in the words of Roger Ebert, “One of the most effective thrillers ever made.”Moby Dick 86%A classic example of man’s inherent fascination with (and deep-rooted fear of) the sea, Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick has inspired countless adaptations, including the Barry Bostwick-led 2010: Moby Dick. For our list, we decided to stick with John Huston’s 1956 version, starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab and boasting a screenplay co-written by Ray Bradbury — what it might lack in snazzy modern-day special effects, it makes up with committed performances and an impressive faithfulness to the novel. Calling it a “rolling and thundering color film,” the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther praised Huston’s work as “herewith devoutly recommended as one of the great motion pictures of our times.”Rogue 94%What’s scarier than a movie about a crocodile? A movie about a giant crocodile. And what’s even scarier than that? One inspired by a giant crocodile who actually existed. And okay, so Rogue played it a little fast and loose with the real story of a notorious Australian menace (ironically named Sweetheart, which, to be fair, would have made a worse title for a horror film) — but why argue with a 100 percent Tomatometer? Brian Orndorf was just one of the critics who praised Rogue, calling it “a film predicated on ideas of suspense and pace rather than blasting violence and idiocy, Rogue is a satisfying, skilled entry in the water-based terror genre.”20,000 Leagues Under the Sea 89%Disney set an in-house budget record for its adaptation of the oft-filmed Jules Verne classic, and came away with the definitive version of the tale. It may not quite live up to its poster’s all-caps boast that it’s “the mightiest motion picture of them all,” but for anyone who enjoys movies about fearless explorers wrangling with sharks, cannibals, and one royally ticked-off giant squid, this 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea comes close enough. Calling it “A breathtaking piece of entertainment,” Film4’s Richard Luck praised it as “amongst the finest live-action films to come out of Disney Studios.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Ironically, we sort of seem to love watching other people go through it — just ask Hollywood, where stalker movies have been raking in the dough for decades. This weekend brings us another entry in the genre: The Roommate, starring Leighton Meester as a college co-ed who develops a psychotic obsession with Minka Kelly, and it got us thinking about previous stalkers on the silver screen. From bunny boilers to former rappers, this week’s list has something for everyone who enjoys watching someone’s life infiltrated by a crazy person. It’s time for Total Recall!The Cable Guy 53%Over the last 30 years or so, Americans have slowly lost their faith in face-to-face connections, bringing us to the point where something as small as letting a cable installer into your home can seem like a recklessly dangerous act — because you just never know when he’s going to turn out to be a rictus-grinned lunatic like the one Jim Carrey played in The Cable Guy. Getting the premium channels for free is nice and everything, but is it worth being stalked by a guy who’ll get you arrested, fired from your job, and kidnap your girlfriend? Most critics thought it was safer just to skip The Cable Guy completely, but it had its defenders — including Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, who wrote, “It’s a fairly interesting effort — much more ambitious than most Carrey vehicles.”Cape Fear 96%To a generation of filmgoers, Cape Fear will always be that one kinda creepy Scorsese picture with De Niro and Nick Nolte — but as fine as the remake is, everyone really needs to see the seething 1962 original, which pits the ever-decent Gregory Peck against a skin-crawlingly brilliant Robert Mitchum. Peck plays the committed family man and contributing citizen; Mitchum plays the skeevy rapist who blames Peck for the eight years he spent in prison; the audience can’t turn away until the inexorably violent conclusion. Bosley Crowther of the New York Times wanted to dislike Cape Fear, but couldn’t: “Menace quivers in the picture like a sneaky electrical charge. And Mr. Mitchum plays the villain with the cheekiest, wickedest arrogance and the most relentless aura of sadism that he has ever managed to generate,” he wrote, following with the disclaimer “But this is really one of those shockers that provokes disgust and regret.”The Crush 24%Critics loathed The Crush (James Berardinelli joined the chorus of disapproval with his review, pointing out that “The story not only relies on the complete and unalterable stupidity of every character in the movie, but on the gullibility of those who watch it”), but audiences weren’t so quick to judge — particularly on home video, where this gleefully cheesy tale of a young magazine writer (Cary Elwes) and the unbalanced 14-year-old (Alicia Silverstone) who pursues him at all costs found its audience. Silverstone picked up a couple of MTV Movie Awards for her performance, and from there it was off to Aerosmith videos and Clueless fame (as well as Batman &amp; Robin, but let’s not talk about that right now).The Fan 37%Thirteen years after he played a schlubby stalker in The King of Comedy, Robert De Niro did it again — with admittedly diminished critical results — for 1996’s The Fan. De Niro stars here as Gil Renard, a down-on-his-luck knife salesman whose irrational love of baseball morphs into an obsession with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes), an outfielder recently traded to Gil’s beloved San Francisco Giants. One thing leads to another, and a few absurd plot twists later, director Tony Scott gave audiences the inevitable home plate showdown. Critics mostly booed, but a few writers thought The Fan was a home run, including Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of Spirituality and Practice, who called it a “mesmerizing film about the soul-killing dimensions of perfectionism.”Fear 46%Between his early 1990s chart-topping run as the boxer-flashing rapper Marky Mark and the award-winning string of films that started with 1997’s Boogie Nights, Mark Wahlberg was just another struggling actor, albeit one whose brother was the angriest member of the New Kids on the Block. It was during this period that Wahlberg starred in Fear, a suburban dad’s nightmare about a psychotic punk who latches on to a naïve teenager (Reese Witherspoon) and then, when she breaks up with him, enlists his friends to take revenge on her entire family (including the dog). A minor breakout success for its two young stars, Fear earned Wahlberg an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Villain, although most critics didn’t think much of it. Clint Morris offered a minority opinion for Film Threat, calling it “Corny but cool” and adding, “Wahlberg has presence.”Fatal Attraction 76%Hey, she warned him that she wasn’t going to be ignored — and when Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) didn’t listen, Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) made good on that promise by attempting suicide, murdering a defenseless bunny, kidnapping his daughter, and eventually attempting a little bathtub foul play. A deranged stalker classic of the 1980s, Fatal Attraction functioned as both a slick thriller and a cautionary morality tale for husbands entertaining the thought of stepping out on their wives — and more importantly, it was good cinema, as argued by critics like the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson, who wrote, “Fatal Attraction has an inescapable pull to it; it’s suffocatingly exciting.”The Hand That Rocks the Cradle 63%Drive a woman’s husband to suicide — and put her under enough stress in the process that she loses her baby and has to have a hysterectomy — and there’s simply no telling what she’ll do. Case in point: Rebecca De Mornay in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, 1992’s cheesetastic stalker hit about a grieving widow who poses as a nanny to infiltrate the home of the woman (Annabella Sciorra) who helped expose her obstetrician husband’s proclivity for inappropriate touching. While most critics weren’t particularly impressed with it, Cradle had its defenders, including Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, who wrote, “Curtis Hanson’s direction and Amanda Silver’s screenplay are both models of no-flab craft and intelligence, and all the actors (who also include Ernie Hudson and Julianne Moore) are believable from the first frame to the last.”The King of Comedy 89%A miserable failure at the box office during its theatrical run, 1983’s The King of Comedy is nevertheless one of the more prescient films of the decade — not only because of the unflinchingly honest way it deconstructs the relationship between celebrities and their fans, but because of its trenchant observations on celebrity culture in general. Hopeful comedian/psycho stalker Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is a fairly lamentable human being, but in the reality TV era, his rise to fame doesn’t seem all that unusual — and now that we’ve been conditioned to expect the worst from our matinee idols for decades, the unctuous antics of his obsession (a never-better Jerry Lewis) are all too familiar. “It’s Martin Scorsese’s second least popular movie, after The Last Temptation of Christ,” observed Salon’s Joyce Millman, “which is a shame, because it’s Scorsese’s second greatest film, after Taxi Driver.”One Hour Photo 82%Having Robin Williams stalk your family may not seem like such a bad time, but the unlucky clan that piqued his interest in One Hour Photo didn’t get the cuddly good-time Robin of Aladdin or Mrs. Doubtfire; no, they picked up a creepy weirdo who covered one of his apartment walls with pictures of them — and decided to take matters into his own hands when he discovered that their real life didn’t live up to the idyllic fantasy he’d painstakingly assembled. “It’s the mark of a good thriller when we never know quite when to relax,” wrote Jim Shelby of the Palo Alto Weekly, adding, “This movie has several witty and visually adept sequences which caught me completely off guard, and has me still thinking about them.”Play Misty for Me 84%Clint Eastwood’s directorial debut is an all-time stalker classic, about a late-night DJ (Eastwood) whose ill-advised fling with a fan (future Arrested Development matriarch Jessica Walter) has seriously unintended consequences — starting with her repeated calls into his show to request “Misty,” and concluding with some high-stakes stabby action in the final act. “Eastwood displays a vigorous talent for sequences of violence and tension,” wrote Time’s Jay Cocks, adding, “He has obviously seen Psycho and Repulsion more than once, but those are excellent texts and he has learned his lessons passing well.”Single White Female 53%No surprises here — if any movie belongs on this list, it’s the 1992 hit from which The Roommate seems to have lifted most of its DNA. Starring Bridget Fonda as a software developer who needs a roommate after she tosses her cheating boyfriend (Steven Weber) out on his keister, and Jennifer Jason Leigh as the secretly nutso woman who moves in after answering her ad, Single White Female offered viewers plenty of sex, violence, and ludicrous plot twists — none of which were enough to impress most critics. Rob Thomas of Madison’s Capital Times was among those who enjoyed it, however, admitting, “This should be trash, but Fonda and Leigh’s performances keep things believably chilling.”Sleeping with the Enemy 20%By February of 1991, Home Alone had been king of the box office for nearly three months — and then along came this nail-biting thriller about an abused wife (Julia Roberts) who meticulously fakes her own death to escape her mustachioed control freak of a husband (Patrick Bergin). Of course, she unwittingly leaves just enough loose ends behind to convince him that she isn’t really dead, thus setting in motion the murderous chain of events that turned Sleeping with the Enemy into a $174 million hit. Critics, however, weren’t as impressed as audiences; while filmgoers were shrieking into their popcorn, Roger Ebert joined his fellow scribes in dissent, saying, “The film begins as an unyielding look at a battered wife, and ends as another one of those thrillers where the villain toys with his victim and the audience.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Over the course of his four decades in showbiz, Woods has cut an intriguingly eclectic path, popping up everywhere from Oliver Stone movies to family flicks (that’s his voice you hear in Stuart Little 2 and Hercules), video games (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas), and TV (where he’s tormented Family Guy‘s Peter Griffin for years). But he’s never received the Total Recall treatment, and when we saw his name on the cast list for Straw Dogs, we knew we needed to repent. It’s time to Total Recall, James Woods style! 75%10. NixonWoods cashed in his chips with Oliver Stone for a role in Nixon, convincing the director to give him a role he’d originally intended for Ed Harris: H.R. Haldeman, the presidential aide whose ruthless politics helped make him a natural lightning rod — and eventual scapegoat — for the Watergate scandal that ended Nixon’s administration. He ended up becoming part of an impressive ensemble cast that included Joan Allen, J.T. Walsh, Mary Steenburgen, Bob Hoskins, Anthony Hopkins as Nixon, and, yes, Ed Harris (who ultimately played CIA operative E. Howard Hunt) — and although none of those names were enough to attract much of an audience during the movie’s theatrical run, the end result was impressive enough for critics like Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman, who wrote that “it’s overwhelming to see the many sides of Richard Nixon brought together with this kind of epic force. More than just biography, Nixon is a dizzying and cathartic spectacle — a free fall through 50 years of American political imagination.” 77%9. The Virgin SuicidesMovies about suicide are generally a pretty tough sell. To make a movie about the suicides of five teenage girls, you’d have to be nuts — or Sofia Coppola, who made her directorial debut with this adaptation of the Jeffrey Eugenides novel about five girls (Kirsten Dunst, Leslie Hayman, A.J. Cook, Chelse Swain, and Hanna R. Hall) whose relationship with their overprotective parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner) leads them to make some fairly reckless, and ultimately tragic, decisions. The Virgin Suicides was understandably not a huge hit at the box office, but it proved a critically auspicious debut for Coppola, whose surprisingly assured direction helped inspire Moira MacDonald of the Seattle Times to call it “A disarmingly poetic — and specifically female — vision of adolescence that it belongs in a category of its own.” 75%8. EyewitnessScreenwriter Steve Teisch followed up his Academy Award-winning script for 1979’s Breaking Away with Eyewitness, a murder mystery thriller about a janitor (William Hurt) who has a chance to pursue his long-standing crush on a local newswoman (Signourney Weaver) after a successful businessman is murdered in the building where he works. Woods delivered a memorable supporting turn here as Hurt’s best friend, a shifty fellow janitor named Aldo, helping convince the New York Times’ Vincent Canby that “Eyewitness is not terrifically strong on logic. Instead, it runs on the energy generated by its appealingly oddball characters, all beautifully acted by the members of a large cast of mostly New York actors.” 78%7. VideodromeWhen a movie can be justifiably described as one of David Cronenberg’s weirder pictures, you know it’s got to be pretty darn strange — and Videodrome does not disappoint, following the increasingly bizarre adventures of a Toronto cable channel president (Woods) whose exposure to a pirated cable signal leads him into a dark spiral of conspiracies, violence, and unforgettably strange nightmares. In 1983, Videodrome‘s fevered vision of a culture soured by lowest-common-denominator reality television seemed over the top; now, it seems prescient. As Jeremiah Kipp wrote for Flipside Movie Emporium, “Nearly twenty years after Videodrome was shot, it still feels contemporary.” 80%6. CasinoGet Martin Scorsese together with Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and a script about life in the Mafia, and you know the results are going to be pretty entertaining — and 1995’s Casino, which reunited Woods with his Once Upon a Time in America castmate De Niro, was no exception. Starring De Niro as Ace Rothstein, a sports handicapper who goes to Vegas to head up a (you guessed it) casino for the Mafia, Pesci as the predictably short-tempered Mob enforcer who makes life difficult for Ace, and Woods as the shyster who disrupts his marriage, Casino broke $100 million at the box office, earned Sharon Stone a Best Actress Oscar nomination, and won praise from critics like Variety’s Todd McCarthy, who wrote that “Martin Scorsese’s intimate epic about money, sex and brute force is a grandly conceived study of what happens to goodfellas from the mean streets when they outstrip their wildest dreams and achieve the pinnacle of wealth and power.” 83%5. CopA rare showcase in a résumé full of supporting roles, 1987’s Cop finds Woods playing, well, a cop — albeit one whose unconventional style and general disdain for rules costs him his badge while he’s in the middle of the case of his career. Writer/director James B. Harris, who previously worked with Woods on 1982’s Fast-Walking, adapted the script from James Ellroy’s novel Blood on the Moon — and although the result proved less than arresting for audiences, who mostly ignored Cop while it was in theaters, it impressed critics like Roger Ebert, who wrote simply, “Woods was born to play this role.” 85%4. The Onion FieldAfter spending the better part of a decade toiling in bit parts in films and TV movies, Woods scored his breakout role in Harold Becker’s The Onion Field. A dramatization of the Joseph Wambaugh novel inspired by the real-life case of two homicidal maniacs who dragged a pair of cops into a field to kill them, it was probably too profoundly disquieting to attract major mainstream success — but Woods’ performance as the charming psychopath Greg Powell earned him a Golden Globe nomination, and Variety concurred, writing that “James Woods as the near-psychotic Powell is chillingly effective, creating a flakiness in the character that exudes the danger of a live wire near a puddle.” 87%3. Once Upon a Time in AmericaWith an original cut weighing in at nearly four hours, Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in America is a true epic — and if Leone had been able to convince his producers, it would have been split into two three-hour films. But unlike a lot of sprawling dramas, America justifies its extended running time; Leone, working from Harry Grey’s novel The Hoods, had a lot of story to tell — and with Woods helping anchor a large cast that also included Robert De Niro, Tuesday Weld, and Elizabeth McGovern, he had the actors to tell it. Studio interference resulted in a bowdlerized American cut that reportedly infuriated Leone, but the end result still haunted critics like Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader, who was moved to write, “Every gesture is immediate, and every gesture seems eternal.” 89%2. SalvadorWoods received the first of his two Academy Award nominations for his work in Oliver Stone’s Salvador, a 1986 war drama about a rather unlikable American journalist who’s burned so many bridges that his only professional recourse is to head to El Salvador with his unemployed DJ buddy (Jim Belushi) to try and find stories in what they initially regard as a relatively inconsequential war. Like a lot of films that try and shine a light on war while shots are still being fired, Salvador bombed at the box office — but it found an appreciative audience with writers like Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic, who called it “One of Oliver Stone’s best films, and absolutely James Woods’ best performance.” 95%1. True BelieverLoosely inspired by a case from the fascinating files of real-life attorney Tony Serra, 1989’s True Believer gave Woods a chance to go toe-to-toe with rising star Robert Downey, Jr. in a courtroom thriller about a pair of lawyers who uncover a deep, dark conspiracy behind the imprisonment of a young Korean (Yuji Okumoto) accused of a gang-related murder. The role of bruised idealist Eddie Dodd called for a magnetic, finely layered performance — and Woods responded, according to Time’s Richard Schickel, who wrote that “Woods’ angry energy is clarifying as well as terrifying, and when he unleashes it (usually without warning), the effect is to focus our attention where it belongs, not on a suspense story but on the mysteries of human behavior.”In case you were wondering, here are Woods’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Once Upon a Time in America — 92%2. Casino — 91%3. John Q — 83%4. Salvador — 83%5. The Virgin Suicides — 80%6. Videodrome — 79%7. Contact — 74%8. Nixon — 72%9. Any Given Sunday — 70%10.

But while misguided efforts like Daredevil and Miami Vice obscured Farrell’s gifts, he remained capable of superlative work — and he’s proved it with a string of critically lauded appearances in recent films. The latest chapter in Farrell’s reinvention is set to arrive with the forthcoming season of HBO’s True Detective, in which Farrell has just been announced as one of the lead actors. With that in mind, we decided now would be the perfect time to take a look back at the critical highlights of an often underrated career. It’s time for Total Recall! 72%10. Phone BoothFarrell reunited with his Tigerland director, Joel Schumacher, for this man-in-a-box action thriller about a publicist (Farrell) who finds himself trapped in a phone booth by an unseen sniper who doesn’t much care for the way he’s been living his life. Written by Larry Cohen, who had originally pitched a loose version of the concept to Alfred Hitchcock during the 1960s, Phone Booth gave Farrell the opportunity to carry most of a film’s weight on his shoulders — and he succeeded according to most critics, including Peter Howell of the Toronto Star, who wrote, “Anyone inclined to argue with the logic of the story — and there’s certainly much to argue about — is advised to just sit back and watch how Farrell’s Stu unravels before our eyes.” 72%9. Fright NightIf director Craig Gillespie had polled horror fans in 2011 and asked them if he really needed to remake 1985’s Fright Night, the answer probably would have been a resounding “no;” after all, the original was not only a surprise hit, it had matured into a solid favorite among scary movie lovers, and little seemed to be gained by updating the story of a horror-loving teen (William Ragsdale) who makes the awful discovery that his new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is secretly a vampire. While it may not have been strictly necessary, the new Fright Night — starring Anton Yelchin as young Charley Brewster and Colin Farrell as the undead addition to the neighborhood — proved surprisingly potent, with Farrell’s charismatic performance matching Gillespie’s confident lens. As Adam Graham wrote for the Detroit News, “Farrell is all darting eyes, facial ticks and macho confidence. He never goes over the top, he’s not a showy actor, but he’s clearly relishing his role and eating it up with abandon. He makes this a Night to remember.” 73%8. IntermissionDirector John Crowley made his feature film debut with this ensemble comedy about a group of young Dubliners (including Farrell, Cillian Murphy, and Colm Meaney) whose seemingly disparate struggles share a narrative thread, captured by a filmmaker (Tomas O’Suilleabhain) shadowing a police detective (Meaney) who’s determined to lock up a persistently troublesome petty crook (Farrell). While it wasn’t a big commercial hit, Intermission found favor with critics like Carrie Rickey of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who said it “bursts with the energy of a documentary filmed on the run with a stolen camera.” 74%7. The Way BackA fact-based film about a group of people trudging their way out of a Soviet gulag might not sound like the most entertaining way of spending a couple of hours in a darkened theater, but there’s an exception to every rule, and according to most critics, Peter Weir’s The Way Back fits the bill. Led by Farrell, Ed Harris, Jim Sturgess, and Saoirse Ronan, this epic tribute to man’s unquenchable thirst for freedom may be pedestrian in terms of focus, but not in execution — and while it was never going to be anyone’s idea of a blockbuster hit, it found a comfortable home with critics like the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Carrie Rickey, who wrote, “Whether it is truth, fiction or, most likely, a little of each, the story Weir tells is a powerful parable of man’s charge for freedom and his humbling by nature.” 77%6. TigerlandFarrell — who earned his first noteworthy credit only the year before, with a small part in Tim Roth’s The War Zone — got his big break in this Joel Schumacher war drama, which focuses on the relationships between a group of Army recruits during the waning years of the Vietnam War. By the time Tigerland reached theaters, Hollywood had been producing Vietnam movies for decades, including some true classics of American film, and the familiarity of its subject matter certainly wasn’t lost on critics; on the other hand, it was an unexpected return to form for Schumacher after garish flops like Batman &amp; Robin and 8MM, and Farrell’s performance earned raves from writers such as Matthew Turner of ViewLondon, who wrote, “The hype is justified — Farrell’s performance just screams star quality and has already drawn comparisons with Steve McQueen and Paul Newman.” 79%5. Saving Mr. BanksA holiday season Walt Disney biopic starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson and directed by the guy who directed The Blind Side? If you didn’t know any better, you’d suspect Saving Mr. Banks of being a movie marshmallow, but even if the results are guilty of ladling on the Disney formula, hey — it wouldn’t be a formula if it didn’t work. Part of what makes Banks such an easygoing pleasure is the expertly assembled cast that director John Lee Hancock arranged around his stars, including Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford, Jason Schwartzman, and — as the alcoholic father whose dark legacy shadows Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers (Thompson) even as an adult — Colin Farrell. “Saving Mr. Banks wraps a seduction inside a seduction with enjoyable results,” wrote the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern. “It’s a Disney film in every sense of the term.” 84%4. In BrugesBy 2008, Farrell’s career had endured a string of high-profile duds, and plenty of people had written him off — but many of them were forced to think twice after watching In Bruges, Martin McDonagh’s pitch-black comedy about a pair of hit men (played by Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) whose latest assignment from their ill-tempered boss (Ralph Fiennes) doesn’t exactly turn out the way he intended. A Sundance favorite, Bruges earned Farrell a Golden Globe for his work, as well as critical appreciation from scribes like Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel, who wrote, “This dark comedy shifts effortlessly between silly and sobering, and it finally gives Colin Farrell the chance to be as funny as we’ve long suspected he could be.” 83%3. Seven PsychopathsFarrell reunited with In Bruges director Martin McDonagh for 2012’s Seven Psychopaths, a similarly black, violent comedy about a struggling screenwriter named Marty (Farrell) whose efforts to complete his long-gestating script (titled, you guessed it, Seven Psychopaths), are complicated by the well-meaning but buffoonish exploits of his friends Billy (Sam Rockwell) and Hans (Christopher Walken), whose latest scheme has enraged a local gangster (Woody Harrelson) that gives Marty more to worry about than writer’s block. It’s crowded in terms of both plot and cast, but McDonagh weaves all of his threads surprisingly smoothly, and although it didn’t make much of an impact in theaters, it found plenty of friends on the critical circuit. “This,” applauded Richard Roeper, “is one of the best times I’ve had at the movies in years.” 90%2. Minority ReportBetween 2002 and 2003, Farrell appeared in eight films, and they were a rather uneven bunch; his output during this period included such critical misfires as S.W.A.T. and Daredevil. But it wasn’t all bad, and Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report is a case in point. Starring Tom Cruise as a cop framed for a “future crime” he didn’t commit — and Farrell as the Department of Justice agent who doggedly pursues him — this visually distinctive adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story racked up over $350 million in worldwide box office receipts, provoked political discussion during a time when civil liberties were returning to the forefront of our national news, and impressed critics such as Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, who applauded, “This is the kind of pure entertainment that, in its fullness and generosity, feels almost classic.” 90%1. Crazy HeartJeff Bridges earned some of the best reviews of his career for Crazy Heart — and so did Farrell, who popped up in an uncredited supporting role as Tommy Sweet, the successful former protege of Bridges’ struggling singer/songwriter character, Bad Blake. It wasn’t a big part, but it gave Farrell the chance to strip away some of the baggage that had accumulated around his talent, not to mention allowing him the chance to show off vocal chops no one knew he had. It all added up to an Oscar for Bridges, as well as some of the year’s freshest reviews; as Kyle Smith wrote for the New York Post, “It’s one of the year’s best, most deeply felt films.”In case you were wondering, here are Farrell’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1.

The genre has had its ups and downs over the years, but it’s never really gone away completely, and for good reason — from goofy comedies to sweeping romances and blockbuster action adventures, it’s a time period with something to offer film fans of all persuasions. To prove it, here’s this week’s feature: a fond (but by no means comprehensive) look back at some of our favorite films inspired by ancient Rome. We came, we saw, we Total Recalled!Agora 53%After all these years (and so many movies), it isn’t easy to make a Roman empire film that breaks new ground — but it isn’t impossible, as illustrated by 2009’s Agora. Starring Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, a fourth-century philosopher and scholar who lived in Roman Egypt, Agora asked thought-provoking — and depressingly timely — questions about religious fundamentalism and gender roles. And even if it didn’t pose them all as artfully as it could have (Tom Long of the Detroit News dismissed it as “something of a bore”), it still found favor with critics like Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, who wrote, “Some may consider Agora sound history, others may label it heresy, but I call it thumping good drama.”Ben-Hur 86%MGM’s recent money troubles are nothing new — the studio has teetered on the brink a few times, and they nearly went under in the late 1950s, only to be saved by the $15 million gamble known as Ben-Hur. Though not the first adaptation of Lew Wallace’s 1880 novel, it was by far the most successful, grossing almost $100 million (in 1950s dollars!) and winning an astonishing 11 Academy Awards, a record that would remain unbroken until James Cameron’s Titanic. With Charlton Heston’s gravitas in the title role and a hefty 212-minute running time — plus one of the most grandiose action scenes ever filmed — critics and audiences couldn’t help but be awed. As Phil Villarreal wrote for the Arizona Daily Star, “The film moves with an assurance and majesty hardly seen in modern movies.”Caligula 23%Fittingly for a film about the reign of one of the Roman Empire’s most infamous emperors, Caligula (don’t call it Gore Vidal’s Caligula or he’ll sue you from beyond the grave) is a legendary filmmaking debacle. A whirling cesspool of lawsuits, disputed credits, assorted sundry cuts, it took the brave step of merging historical epic drama with hardcore pornography; perhaps unsurprisingly, most critics weren’t all that impressed (Roger Ebert, no prude, walked out during his screening, and called it “sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash”). Still, it has its defenders: Gregory Weinkauf admitted it was “Kinda dumb and tacky,” but countered with, “at least it’s a real movie.”Centurion 61%If the storyline behind The Eagle seems familiar, it’s because Neil Marshall’s Centurion drew from the same well just last year. But as disappointing as these cases of lousy Hollywood timing can be, it’s easy to see what filmmakers have found so fascinating about this story — after all, it isn’t every day that an entire legion of soldiers vanishes into an unsolvable riddle of history. In Marshall’s mud-and-blood-fueled take on the story, a crew of stony-faced action vets (including Dominic West and Michael Fassbender) march off to war against the tenacious Picts, under orders to — as the poster put it — “fight or die.” (Spoiler alert: They did plenty of both.) Centurion wasn’t a huge hit, either with critics or filmgoers, but it’s unapologetic bloodlust earned the approval of scribes such as Cary Darling of the Dallas Morning News, who deemed it “Far more entertaining, and infinitely less cumbersome, than its recent big-budget Hollywood counterparts.”Cleopatra 62%You want an epic movie? How about this: 1963’s Cleopatra was the highest-grossing film of the year, but it still lost money, thanks to the $44 million tab run up by 20th Century Fox and director Joseph L. Mankiewicz. It’s all up there on the screen — all four hours and five minutes of it, from Cleopatra’s tryst with Caesar (Rex Harrison) to her affair with Marc Antony (Richard Burton) to her final showdown with Octavian (Roddy McDowall). Elizabeth Taylor may not have looked the part, but who else could have played Cleopatra? If and when Steven Soderbergh gets Angelina Jolie in front of the 3D cameras for his musical about the legendary Egyptian queen, she’ll have some big eye makeup to fill — but then again, most critics didn’t think much of Cleopatra in the first place. Billy Mowbray of Film4 saw something many of his colleagues didn’t, calling it “A giant of a movie that is sometimes lumbering, but ever watchable thanks to its uninhibited ambition, size and glamour.”Gladiator 77%By the late 1970s, swords and sandals epics were about as hip as musicals or Westerns — and even those genres enjoyed periodic revivals during the 1980s and 1990s. It took Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe, and a little movie called Gladiator to reignite filmgoers’ interest in ancient Rome, to the tune of over $450 million in worldwide box office and a whopping 12 Academy Award nominations (five of which it won, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Crowe). With a story strongly reminiscent of The Fall of the Roman Empire and Spartacus, Gladiator certainly wasn’t anything new for Hollywood — but after so many years away from the spotlight, tales of ancient Rome felt fresh again, and modern filmmaking techniques made it possible to present them more viscerally than ever. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune said as much in his review, declaring Gladiator “The most visually spectacular of all Roman Empire epics.”History of the World — Part I 59%Yeah, we know putting this one in here is cheating a little, but even if it mostly takes place in other eras, History of the World, Part I contains plenty of ancient Rome-inspired laughs — and besides, you aren’t likely to see another movie where Caesar’s palace is played by its modern-day Las Vegas counterpart, or where you’ll learn about the powerful effects of “Roman Red” marijuana and the true story of the Last Supper. Like most of Mel Brooks’ movies, History has its ups and downs, but — in the words of eFilmCritic’s Scott Weinberg — “It succeeds only in fits and starts, but the bits that do work are hilarious!”Julius Caesar 95%Shakespeare’s play about the titular dictator received the Joseph L. Mankiewicz treatment with this 1953 Best Picture nominee, starring Louis Calhern (King Lear) in the title role alongside a showy supporting cast that included Greer Garson, Deborah Kerr, John Gielgud, James Mason, and Marlon Brando (who received a Best Actor nomination for his efforts). Julius Caesar weighs in at a relatively trim 121 minutes, but that was plenty epic enough for the critics, who showered it with universal praise — including Geoff Andrew of Time Out, who called it “a remarkably successful stab at Shakespeare.”Monty Python’s Life of Brian 95%Hollywood hasn’t turned to the Roman Empire for laughs very often, but that isn’t for lack of comedic potential — as evidenced by this Monty Python classic, which imagines the absurd confusion that might envelop the life of a man born on the same night as (and just a couple of stables away from) Jesus Christ. A vicious satire of organized religion, politics, and bureaucracy, Monty Python’s Life of Brian was unquestionably one of the more provocative comedies of the era — and provoke it did, inspiring public debate, accusations of blasphemy, and a healthy $20 million return on its $4 million budget (largely contributed by George Harrison). But as with most of Python’s aggressively silly material, there was a message behind all the goofing around; as Anthony Lane pointed out in his review for the New Yorker, “The Pythons are enlightened jesters, whose scorn is reserved for those who persist in walking in darkness.”Quo Vadis 88%Offering nearly three hours of sweeping Technicolor drama, this adaptation of Henryk Sienkiewicz’s 1896 novel took viewers all the way back to 64 AD, and the bloody struggle between the Roman government and the burgeoning Christian movement. Pretty high-stakes stuff, and director Mervyn LeRoy (Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo) mined it for every last drop of melodrama, aided by a cast that included genre mainstays Deborah Kerr and Peter Ustinov. Not the most subtle approach, perhaps, but it worked well enough to earn Quo Vadis eight Academy Award nominations — and critical praise from the likes of the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther, who trumpeted, “Here is a staggering combination of cinema brilliance and sheer banality, of visual excitement and verbal boredom, of historical pretentiousness and sex.”Satyricon 78%By the late 1960s, ancient Rome had been visited by plenty of filmmakers — but none who viewed it through the distinctive lens of Federico Fellini. Inspired by Petronius’ first-century fiction, Fellini’s Satyricon blended lusty comedy, violence, historical drama, and anything else he could squeeze into two hours to produce a boldly irreverent international hit that earned the director a Best Director Oscar nomination. “It is so much more ambitious and audacious than most of what we see today that simply as a reckless gesture, it shames these timid times,” applauded Roger Ebert, adding, “Films like this are a reminder of how machine-made and limited recent product has become.”Spartacus 93%No surprises here — you think “swords and sandals,” and Stanley Kubrick’s 1960 classic is one of the first films that comes to mind. And for good reason: Every element of Spartacus, from Dalton Trumbo’s script to Alex North’s score, Kubrick’s direction, and a stellar cast that included Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, and Peter Ustinov (who won an Oscar for his work) was assembled with top-shelf ingredients. At over three hours, this tale of a Roman slave rebellion is a certified good old-fashioned Hollywood epic, and it includes one of modern film’s most oft-quoted scenes to boot. As Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote for the Chicago Reader, “This may be the most literate of all the spectacles set in antiquity.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Though his filmography has certainly weathered its fair share of ups and downs, Wes Craven is a notable exception to the rule: starting with 1972’s Last House on the Left, he’s demonstrated an uncommon gift for freaking out filmgoers around the world. In honor of his return to the Scream franchise this week, we decided to lock the door, close the curtains, and take a peek (through our fingers, natch) at his best films, Total Recall style! 65%10. The Serpent and the RainbowThe years immediately following his Nightmare on Elm Street breakthrough weren’t especially kind to Wes Craven; he tried to prove he was capable of more than horror (the short-lived sitcom The People Next Door) while searching for new franchises (Shocker) and raiding his past for cash-grab sequels (The Hills Have Eyes II). One small bright spot during this period, however, was 1987’s The Serpent and the Rainbow, which followed a scientist (Bill Pullman) on his nightmarish quest to uncover the truth about a Haitian herbal toxin rumored to turn people into zombies. While it wasn’t a huge hit, Rainbow represented a more cerebral — yet still plenty scary — turn for Craven, something appreciated by critics like the Washington Post’s Desson Thomson, who observed that the director “seems wiser and more story-conscious — but thankfully still full of the same surprises.” 62%9. The Last House on the LeftThe original poster warned that The Last House on the Left “rests on 13 acres of earth over the very center of Hell” — and included instructions for avoiding fainting spells while watching the movie. Pretty standard stuff for this kind of grisly exploitation fare, but Last House is a tad more deranged than most, plunging the audience into a sickening succession of nightmarish random violence, sexual depravity, and bloodthirsty revenge. As an artistic statement on the costs of violence, it boasts arguable merit — and for sheer revolting spectacle, it’s (thankfully) hard to match. “It isn’t artistically adroit,” admitted Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader, “but if success in this genre is counted by squirms, it’s a success.” 63%8. Music of the HeartAfter rejuvenating his career with the first two chapters in the Scream trilogy, Craven took a surprising turn into uplifting, reality-based drama with 1999’s Music of the Heart, the story of a Harlem violin teacher (played by Meryl Streep) whose dogged determination (and incredible luck) helped save a school arts program — and put her fundraising concert on stage at Carnegie Hall. It’s just the kind of true story that Hollywood loves to coat with corny melodrama, and while most critics agreed that Craven wasn’t immune to that impulse, they ultimately felt that Streep’s performance — which earned her an Academy Award nomination — helped distinguish Music from similar films. As Eleanor Ringel Gillespie wrote for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Streep’s extraordinary performance makes this the rare inspirational movie that actually is, well, inspirational.” 65%7. The Hills Have EyesThrow together a “no nukes” message with 89 minutes of stereotypes about rural people and you’ve got The Hills Have Eyes, Craven’s gleefully deranged 1977 hit about a traveling family (whose members included a young Dee Wallace) stalked and murdered by a pack of cave-dwelling mutants in the Nevada desert. Featuring a truly memorable performance by Michael Berryman as the brutal clan member known as Pluto, Hills has spawned a number of sequels, a remake, and a sequel to the remake, but none of them hold a candle to the sadistic original. Marjorie Baumgarten of the Austin Chronicle was part of the wave of critical applause, writing that “Inventive story ideas and humorous touches give this horror picture an enduring relevancy and stylistic flourish.” 63%6. Swamp ThingAfter making a name for himself with unabashed horror movies like The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes, Craven made a bid for crossover territory with 1982’s Swamp Thing, an adaptation of the DC Comics series about a scientist (Ray Wise) whose experimental formula ends up turning him into a hulking mound of sentient plant matter. It sounds campy, and it definitely is, but Craven has always had a pretty sharp knack for this stuff, and particularly in the context of pre-CG comic book films, Swamp Thing earned a surprising level of admiration from critics who appreciated its so-bad-it’s-goodness — as well as Craven’s taste in leading ladies. Cole Smithey fell into the latter camp, reminiscing, “Oh yes, Adrienne Barbeau. Thanks for the memories.” 79%5. Red EyeAfter 2000’s Scream 3, Craven took a five-year hiatus from directing, only to return in 2005 with a pair of movies: Cursed and Red Eye. The less said about the former film, the better, but Red Eye was actually something of a return to form for Craven — a claustrophobic thriller about a hotel manager (Rachel McAdams) who finds herself sitting next to a terrorist (Cillian Adams) on an overnight flight. The tight-focused setup of Carl Ellsworth’s script eventually gives way to an overblown final act involving an assassination attempt (and an underwater missile), but most critics didn’t mind; as Roger Ebert wrote, “After a summer of crashes, bangs, endless chase scenes and special effects that belittle the actors standing in front of them, what a pleasure to see characters in a thriller doing what people like themselves possibly could do.” 79%4. Wes Craven’s New NightmareAfter six installments — most of them made without Craven’s involvement — the Nightmare on Elm Street series was looking a little tired. Ultimately, not even Craven’s return for 1994’s New Nightmare was enough to lure back filmgoers who’d grown numb to Freddy Krueger’s increasingly cartoonish antics, but it wasn’t for lack of trying: the seventh Nightmare offered a nifty twist that brought Freddy out of the movies and into the real world, where he terrorized Heather Langenkamp, the star of the first film. And even if audiences weren’t having this Nightmare, critics rewarded it with the franchise’s best reviews in years — including Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who called it “An ingenious, cathartic exercise in illusion and fear.” 81%3. Scream 2What’s the only thing that makes more sense than a horror movie that satirizes the conventions of the genre? A sequel that makes fun of horror sequels, of course — and with Scream 2, Craven added a new layer of wicked fun to the franchise, winking at the genre’s rote formula by explicitly laying out — and often subverting — audience expectations. The cast is bigger, the body count is higher, and the ending is stuffed with twice as many last-minute surprise revelations, and Scream 2 transcends them all. As Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum put it, “A yum-yum cast of pretties pull off the neat trick of affectionately counting the many ways available to horror sequels to suck, without making a sequel that sucks.” 79%2. ScreamSlasher films were — ahem — all but dead by the mid-1990s, due in part to the flood of cruddy sequels churned out by the genre’s many franchises. Craven was indirectly responsible for some of this, so it’s perhaps only fitting that he was the one who revitalized slashers with 1996’s Scream, a gleefully meta slice of teen horror that poured on buckets of satire to match its rivers of fake blood. “It’s been a long time since a teen-slasher movie has offered up anything but dull buckets of gore,” wrote Margaret A. McGurk of the Cincinnati Enquirer, adding, “With Scream, the genre reclaims its roots.” 94%1. A Nightmare on Elm StreetYou knew we’d end up here, right? No matter how many movies he makes, and no matter how many frights he gives audiences, Wes Craven will always be most closely identified with the Nightmare on Elm Street series, and this 1984 classic is the reason why. No matter how many times Freddy Krueger resurfaces in subpar sequels and reboots, it can’t erase the pure effectiveness of the original. No child of the 1980s will ever forget the spine-tingling dread they felt the first time they saw Freddy’s razor-tipped gloves, or heard the haunting refrain “One, two, Freddy’s coming for you” — and film fans of all ages agree with the words of Shannon J. Harvey of Australia’s Sunday Times, who called it “One of the best all-out horror movies ever made.”In case you were wondering, here are Craven’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. A Nightmare on Elm Street — 78%2. Scream — 70%3. Music of the Heart — 68%4. Red Eye — 66%5. Wes Craven’s New Nightmare — 65%6. The Hills Have Eyes — 61%7. The People Under The Stairs — 60%8.

The decade of supporting roles that followed may not have filled Rudd’s bank account with leading man money, but they added up to an eclectic filmography — and by the time he broke out all over again as a member of Team Apatow, he was one of the more recognizable faces in the industry. To celebrate his reunion with Steve Carell (whose 10 best we counted down here) in this week’s Dinner for Schmucks, let’s take a Total Recall look back at Rudd’s best-reviewed movies![tomatometer]MovieID=14092[/tomatometer]10. The Shape Of ThingsNeil LaBute has never been known for having a particularly sunny view of humanity, and he continued his savage streak with The Shape of Things when it made its Broadway debut in 2001. Adapting Shape for the screen two years later, LaBute reunited the stage production’s original cast, including Paul Rudd as Adam, a shy college student whose unexpected romance with the beautiful Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) is not, to put it mildly, what it seems. Like a lot of stage adaptations, The Shape of Things makes for occasionally stolid viewing, and that — along with LaBute’s continued fascination with human cruelty — left critics divided over its merit. For those who appreciated the film’s message, however, it hit hard, including Mark Halverson of the Sacramento News &amp; Review, who called it “A grim and cynical but ultimately arresting exploration of personal expression and modern love.”[tomatometer]MovieID=16978[/tomatometer]9. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron BurgundyAfter scoring his big break with Clueless, Rudd worked steadily, appearing in a steady stream of films, but by the early aughts, he was arguably best known for playing Phoebe’s on-again, off-again boyfriend, Mike Hannigan, on Friends. That all changed with his portrayal of proudly perverted Brian Fantana in the eminently quotable, Will Ferrell-led ensemble comedy Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Who can forget the Fantana-endorsed horror of Sex Panther cologne? Or the way he forever changed the meaning of the word “octagon”? Even many of the most sober-minded critics were forced to submit to its charms, including Ty Burr of the Boston Globe, who conceded, “Sloppy, crude, pursuing the most far-flung tangents in hopes of a laugh, Anchorman still gave me more stupid giggles than I’d care to admit if I weren’t paid to.”[tomatometer]MovieID=434222493[/tomatometer]8. DiggersThough he’s best-known today for his appearances in Team Apatow comedies, Rudd has always been a versatile actor, and in 2007, he issued a reminder in the form of Diggers, a low-key indie dramedy written by ex-The State member Ken Marino. Though its theatrical run came and went with barely a whisper, this tale of third-generation clam diggers in Long Island during the ’70s offered an impeccable cast (including Lauren Ambrose, Ron Eldard, and Maura Tierney) and a charming blend of humorous and thoughtful moments, all evenly directed by Katherine Dieckmann. It was more than enough for critics like Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News, who observed, “What separates Diggers from its kin — notably the Ed Burns movies — is the testosterone balance of its masculine script and Dieckmann’s sensitive direction. Maybe we need more buddy movies by women.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10411[/tomatometer]7. The Cider House RulesJohn Irving’s novels have had an uneven history in Hollywood, from The World According to Garp to Simon Birch, so when the time came to bring The Cider House Rules to the screen, he shouldered the burden of writing the script himself. The result, while not a critical home run, netted a pair of Oscars — one for Michael Caine’s supporting turn as the complex Dr. Larch, and one for Irving’s screenplay. All of which goes to demonstrate that Rudd was in good company here, appearing as Wally Worthington, a friend to the orphan Homer (Tobey Maguire) and unwitting rival for the affections of the luminous Candy (Charlize Theron). Calling Cider “a fable that turns into a 1940s New England variation on Charles Dickens,” the San Francisco Chronicle’s Bob Graham proclaimed, “It is also one dickens of an American movie.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770784369[/tomatometer]6. Role ModelsIf there are two things filmgoers can’t seem to get enough of, it’s men acting like children and children swearing like adults. 2008’s Role Models took these timeless ingredients and took them further than most, thanks to a consistently funny script (co-written by Rudd, Ken Marino, Timothy Dowling, and director David Wain) and an improv-friendly cast that included Jane Lynch and Ken Jeong. As a pair of energy drink salesman forced to mentor a role-playing teen misfit (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and a foul-mouthed grade-schooler (Bobb’e J. Thompson), Rudd and Seann William Scott didn’t have to do much more than keep straight faces while their co-stars let loose. Though some critics were unmoved by all the crude humor, most couldn’t help laughing, among them Laremy Legel of Film.com, who observed that “Role Models could have been another formulaic comedy, fresh off the assembly line. Instead, the work of Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott here is worthy of praise and one of the funnier films this year.”&nbsp;[tomatometer]MovieID=11124[/tomatometer]5. CluelessIf things had turned out a little differently at the box office, 1995 might have been the year Paul Rudd kicked off a string of Halloween sequels with his starring role as Tommy Doyle in Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers. Fortunately for Rudd’s long-term career prospects, Halloween tanked; instead, it was his appearance in a little teen comedy called Clueless that proved most memorable. Appearing as Josh, the nattily attired ex-stepbrother of the endearingly shallow Cher (Alicia Silverstone), Rudd provided a voice of sarcastic reason amidst all the matchmaking and mall-hopping in writer-director Amy Heckerling’s totally ’90s adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma — and gave critics like Brian Lowry another reason to call it “a fresh, disarmingly bright and at times explosively funny comedy well worth a trip to the mall, even if it eventually runs out of gas.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770685290[/tomatometer]4. I Love You, ManRudd’s third collaboration with Jason Segel, I Love You, Man reunited the Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah Marshall castmates for the story of Peter Klaven (Rudd), a real estate agent whose engagement to his girlfriend (Rashida Jones) exposes the near-total absence of male friendship in his life. Seeking a best man, he befriends Sydney Fife (Segel), a freewheeling investor who introduces Peter to the joys of male bonding — and nearly derails his wedding in the process. “It’s a thin premise,” admitted Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post, noting that “I Love You, Man features the usual quota of jokes involving masturbation, projectile vomiting and flatulence. But is it worth it? Thanks to Rudd and Segel (and some terrific cameos), totes magotes.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770675807[/tomatometer]3. Forgetting Sarah MarshallNo terrible breakup is complete without loads of equally terrible advice for the broken-hearted, and Rudd gave Jason Segel plenty of it as the bizarre surfing instructor Chuck, a.k.a. Kunu, in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Though certainly not one of his larger roles, Rudd’s Marshall appearance reaffirmed his gift for a scene-stealing cameo, gave him the opportunity to dispense a memorable variation on the old “if life gives you lemonade” bromide, and helped critics like the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern admit that “Halfway through I realized that I’d lost most of my standards, maybe under my seat, and was enjoying the erratic evolution of the nonsense.”[tomatometer]MovieID=5077[/tomatometer]2. The 40-Year-Old VirginSteve Carell’s coming-out party as a comedic leading man included plenty of seats at the table for his talented co-stars, including Jane Lynch, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, and (of course) Paul Rudd — who, as David the bitter electronics salesman, participated in some of the movie’s most memorable exchanges, and made the timeless threat “I’m going to Yah Mo burn this place to the ground.” Calling it “buoyantly clever and amusing,” Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman praised The 40-Year-Old Virgin as “a comedy of horny embarrassment that has the inspiration to present a middle-aged virgin’s dilemma as a projection of all our romantic anxieties.”[tomatometer]MovieID=460328477[/tomatometer]1. Knocked UpOne of an incredible six films Rudd appeared in throughout 2007, Knocked Up reunited him with 40-Year-Old Virgin director Judd Apatow for another comedic look at the battle between the sexes. As the henpecked Pete, Rudd provided the essential bromance at the heart of every Apatow movie, supplying Seth Rogen’s Ben with advice about marriage (“like that show Everybody Loves Raymond, but it’s not funny”) and a ‘shroom-enhanced trip to Vegas that helps set up the bittersweet developments of the final act. A $200 million hit, Knocked Up jump-started Rogen and Katherine Heigl’s film careers, helped return Rudd to leading man status, and earned the admiration of critics like Salon’s Stephanie Zacharek, who called it “Hilarious from moment to moment, but leaving behind both a warm glow and a sting. This is a picture that refuses to fetishize either the ability to conceive or the significance of our place in the universe once we’ve done so.”In case you were wondering, here are Rudd’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1.

We think you’ll agree that’s a pretty distinguished list of achievements — and with Douglas’ latest film, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, arriving in theaters this weekend, we decided to take the opportunity to look back on his finest moments… Total Recall style! 73%10. Falling DownReleased the year after the L.A. riots exposed long-ignored class and racial rifts in American society, Joel Schumacher’s Falling Down presented a time capsule-ready portrait of the growing confusion and resentment felt by many segments of society in the early 1990s. With his buzz cut, thick-rimmed glasses, and starched, buttoned-down wardrobe, Douglas channeled the middle-class disdain that dominated the media during the rise of grunge, gangsta rap, NAFTA, and The Jerry Springer Show, lashing out with a trail of increasingly high-stakes violence during a simmering L.A. afternoon. It’s an awful lot to chew for what was, in many respects, a rather run-of-the-mill action movie, and some critics found Falling Down‘s blend of bloodshed and black humor a bit hard to swallow. Most, however, appreciated its underlying message, including Roger Ebert, who wrote, “The film … is actually about a great sadness which turns into madness, and which can afflict anyone who is told, after many years of hard work, that he is unnecessary and irrelevant.” 79%9. Wall StreetSmart, sleek, and eminently quotable, Oliver Stone’s Wall Street presented Douglas with what arguably became the most iconic role of his career. He was simply perfect as the oily, morally adrift Gordon Gekko, and although Gekko’s signature proclamation that “greed is good” would go on to haunt Douglas, he was an emblematic character for an era in American history when it became acceptable to not only dedicate your life to the naked pursuit of wealth, but to attain it by any means necessary. The performance won Douglas an Oscar, and roughly 20 years after the wave of financial-sector shenanigans that inspired Wall Street, it became painfully clear that we hadn’t learned our lesson — and Stone was convinced it was time for Gordon Gekko to make his return, setting in motion the sequel that inspired this week’s Total Recall. “Like the rest of Stone’s oeuvre, it’s about as subtle as a sledgehammer,” wrote Christopher Lloyd of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. “But his filmmaking style is like heavy metal: When he hits the right chords, nobody plays with as much power or brash energy.” 85%8. The War of the RosesDouglas and his Romancing the Stone castmates Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito reunited for the second time for this pitch-black comedy about a wealthy married couple (Douglas and Turner) whose disintegrating marriage becomes a desperate, violent squabble over their shared possessions. Doing double duty as director and co-star, DeVito extended his directorial hot streak (begun with 1987’s Throw Momma from the Train), while Douglas and Turner took the love/hate banter they perfected during Stone and Jewel of the Nile and subtracted the love, fueling one of the most entertainingly venomous divorces in cinematic history. As Rob Vaux of the Flipside Movie Emporium put it, “For anyone who ever spent Valentine’s Day alone with a bottle of scotch, for anyone who ever watched the love of their life go stomping out the door, for anyone who ever gazed in hatred at the happy couple spooning in public? this is the movie for you.” 76%7. Fatal AttractionAfter exploring the dark side of lust with 1986’s 9 1/2 Weeks, director Adrian Lyne decided to poke at the seedy underbelly of obsession for the following year’s Fatal Attraction. One of the quintessential thrillers of the 1980s, Attraction follows the horrifying downward spiral set in motion after a married attorney (Douglas) has a one-night stand with a troubled woman (Glenn Close) whose refusal to let go produces fairly dire consequences for everyone concerned. Though it outraged some feminists (and a few bunny owners), Attraction was hugely successful, earning six Academy Award nominations and more than $320 million worldwide — as well as critical raves from the likes of Empire Magazine’s Angie Errigo, who wrote, “Two absolutely riveting performances and a smart reversal of the usual male-female stalker scenario leave behind a nasty taste and an unforgettable cinema experience.” 81%6. Wonder BoysA commercial failure so vexing that Paramount took the unusual step of re-releasing the film nine months after it flopped, Wonder Boys united a strong cast (including Douglas, Frances McDormand, Robert Downey, Jr., Tobey Maguire, and Katie Holmes) to bring to life the well-received novel by Michael Chabon about the adventures of an irresponsible English professor. It was a role uniquely suited to Douglas, who’s all rumpled charm as the pot-smoking, adulterous Grady Tripp — and the source material had an impeccable pedigree, as evidenced by Chabon’s Pulitzer win the following year for The Adventures of Kavalier and Klay. So why did the ticket-buying public tune out on Wonder Boys? Whatever the audience’s reasons, it was their loss, as far as most critics were concerned. As Peter Rainer wrote for New York Magazine, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen another American comedy that mixed rue and slapstick and sentiment in quite this way.” 78%5. Solitary ManWith a filmography as crowded and distinguished as Douglas’, it’s really saying something that one of his ten best-reviewed movies was released just this year. And while it’s true that Solitary Man finds Douglas back in familiar territory — playing an aging cad whose countless poor decisions are finally catching up with him — it’s hard to complain when it’s territory he inhabits this comfortably. Surrounded by a terrific cast that included Susan Sarandon, Mary-Louise Parker, Jesse Eisenberg, Jenna Fischer, and his old pal Danny DeVito, Douglas disappears into the skin of an inherently unlikable character and somehow manages to make you root for him — or at least empathize. “Why do we keep watching this sad, sad man?” asked Ty Burr of the Boston Globe, answering, “because he’s ecstatic as long as he avoids facing reality, and Douglas makes that ecstasy a marvelous thing to behold.” 86%4. The China SyndromeTaking its title from the theory that the core of a nuclear reactor would melt through the Earth if it suffered a full-scale meltdown, The China Syndrome tried to highlight the dangers of nuclear power — and sure enough, less than two weeks after Syndrome was released, the infamous Three Mile Island accident took place, dominating the news and giving the movie a spooky added element of topicality. Douglas, to this point, had seen his greatest successes on television (on The Streets of San Francisco) and as a producer (with One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest); here, acting again as a producer, he starred with Jane Fonda as reporters who witness a narrowly averted meltdown at a power plant, forcing a plant supervisor (Jack Lemmon) to take decisive action. The China Syndrome may have been unusually timely, but it was also a pretty solid conspiracy thriller; as Film4 wrote regarding the four-time Oscar nominee, “The film is one of those rare modern thrillers that manages to combine fantastic acting and intelligent dialogue with real, heart-stopping suspense.” 85%3. Romancing the StoneMovies and television shows about dashing adventurers crashing around the jungle in search of lost treasure were all the rage in the 1980s, and most of them were pretty awful. 1984’s Romancing the Stone proved a noteworthy exception to the rule, largely thanks to the palpable chemistry between Douglas and co-star Kathleen Douglas (not to mention the comic antics of Danny DeVito). Though some dismissed it as a Raiders of the Lost Ark ripoff, this story of a hapless romance novelist (Turner) and the adventurer (Douglas) who helps her nab a giant emerald from the clutches of a Colombian gangster was one of the bigger hits of the year. More importantly, it established an enduring partnership between Douglas, Turner, and DeVito. “Its combination of romance and adventure (and a bit of comedy) was spot-on,” wrote Christopher Null of Filmcritic, “and few films that have arrived since have captured Stone‘s enthusiasm and good-naturedness.” 91%2. The American PresidentRomantic comedies get a pretty bad rap, but the genre wasn’t always the near-exclusive domain of Kate Hudson, Kristen Bell, and Cameron Diaz; once upon a time, you could count on one or two intelligent rom-coms sneaking into theaters and reminding us how it’s done. A case in point: 1995’s The American President, starring Douglas as a widowed president whose romance with an environmental lobbyist (Annette Bening) becomes the dominant issue of his re-election campaign. With a solid supporting cast (including Richard Dreyfuss and Michael J. Fox), gentle direction from Rob Reiner, and a sharp Aaron Sorkin script, President won a landslide victory with critics like Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who wrote, “With great looks, a dandy supporting cast, a zinger-filled screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and Mr. Douglas twinkling merrily in the Oval Office, The American President is sunny enough to make the real Presidency pale by comparison.” 92%1. TrafficOne of the more darkly ambitious films to make its way through the studio system over the last decade, Steven Soderbergh’s Traffic looks at the human cost of the drug trade by following seemingly unconnected stories that slowly converge. In Mexico, a police officer (Benicio del Toro) becomes the unwitting employee of a drug lord; in San Diego, a major dealer (Miguel Ferrer) is targeted by a pair of DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman); and in the Midwest, a crusading judge (Douglas) finds his black-and-white views on drugs challenged when his teenage daughter (Erika Christensen) develops a cocaine addiction. In condensing the six-part BBC series Traffik, Soderbergh had to trim some of the original’s heft, but Traffic was still a four-time Academy Award winner (including Best Director) as well as one of the best-reviewed films of the year, thanks to critics like Andrew Sarris of the New York Observer, who proclaimed, “The promise of Sex, Lies, and Videotape has been fulfilled.”In case you were wondering, here are Douglas’ top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. The Game — 82%2. Traffic — 81%3. Wall Street — 80%4. Falling Down — 79%5. Wonder Boys — 79%6. The China Syndrome — 76%7. The American President — 71%8. The Ghost and the Darkness — 71%9.

He’ll add two more to that tally this month (this week’s Secretariat and next week’s Red), and in honor of all that activity, we decided to dedicate this week’s feature to the ten best-reviewed movies in a filmography stacked with critical winners. It’s time to forget Jonah Hex ever happened — let’s go Total Recall![tomatometer]MovieID=16862[/tomatometer]10. Shadow of the VampireUniting two of the actors who do “disquieting” better than almost anyone in the business, this fictionalized peek behind the scenes of Nosferatu stars Malkovich as director F.W. Murnau, whose quest for verisimilitude on the set of his vampire movie leads him to make a secret pact with the real deal — Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe), presented here not as a thespian, but a bloodthirsty member of the undead. Passed off by Murnau as a particularly dedicated Method actor, Schreck regales the cast and crew with tales of his centuries as a vampire — and gradually, they come to understand that he isn’t just staying in character. Netting several honors (including a Saturn Award, an Independent Spirit Awards, and an Oscar nomination for Dafoe), Shadow had enough bite for critics like the Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Hap Erstein, who called it “An ingenious, diabolical, probably libelous, funhouse of a movie.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770798010[/tomatometer]9. DisgraceMalkovich picked up one of his meatiest roles in this 2008 adaptation of the J.M. Coetzee novel, starring as a South African college professor whose affair with a student costs him his career — and sends him to his daughter’s farm, where post-apartheid racial tensions are simmering beneath the bucolic surface. An award-winner at the Toronto International Film Festival, Disgrace gave Malkovich the chance to take a rather unlikable character on a redemptive storyline arc, and drew appreciative applause from critics like the New York Post’s V.A. Musetto, who admitted, “I cannot tell a lie. I derive great satisfaction watching John Malkovich act.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770673973[/tomatometer]8. The OgreA masterpiece of creepy, steadily mounting dread, Volker Schlöndorff’s The Ogre stars Malkovich as a mentally disabled Frenchman who is used as a recruiter by the Nazis during their World War II occupation. What’s so creepy about that, you ask? Turns out the Ogre has a unique rapport with kids…and he thinks he’s protecting them…and it’s all just sort of awful, really. As a piece of filmmaking, however, The Ogre was almost universally recognized as excellent, and although it understandably wasn’t a huge box office hit, it earned praise from a number of critics — including Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle, who wrote, “Astonishing, disturbing, and altogether an affecting piece of work, The Ogre is Schlondorff — and everyone else involved — working in top form.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13358[/tomatometer]7. The Killing FieldsPart of the banner year that also saw Malkovich earn an Academy Award nomination for Places in the Heart, Roland Joffé’s The Killing Fields relays the heartrending true story of the friendship between three journalists — Cambodian Dith Pran (Haing S. Nor), American Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston), and British Jon Swain (Julian Sands) — during the early days of the Khmer Rouge’s rise to power in Cambodia. Malkovich appears here in the supporting role of American photojournalist Al Rockoff, who was part of the unsuccessful effort to get Pran out of Cambodia before the regime change; the real-life Rockoff was publicly unhappy with the way he was portrayed, but he was part of a small minority — The Killing Fields was ultimately nominated for seven Oscars, and it became an instant critical favorite. “It must be nerve-racking for the producers to offer a tale so lacking in standard melodramatic satisfactions,” wrote Time’s Richard Schickel, “But the result is worth it, for this is the clearest film statement yet on how the nature of heroism has changed in this totalitarian century.”[tomatometer]MovieID=14414[/tomatometer]6. Being John MalkovichYou know you’ve arrived when a screenwriter dedicates an entire movie to the idea that there’s a magical portal into your brain — and although John Malkovich initially resisted starring in Being John Malkovich, director Spike Jonze eventually changed his mind; the rest, as they say, is history. One of the most marvelously weird successes in modern American film, Malkovich follows the adventures of a miserable puppeteer (John Cusack) who stumbles across a temporary gateway into — you guessed it — John Malkovich. And that’s where things start to get really strange, culminating in a series of diagram-worthy romantic entanglements, some memorable Jonze visuals, and a wonderful Charlie Kaufman script. Destined for the commercial fringes, Malkovich was one of the year’s best-reviewed films, enjoying widespread raves from critics like Lou Lumenick of the New York Post, who declared, “Being John Malkovich, which contains not a frame of extraneous footage, is more than a must-see movie: It’s a must-see-more-than-once event.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13176[/tomatometer]5. Dangerous LiaisonsDirector Stephen Frears made his grand Hollywood entrance with this adaptation of the Christopher Hampton play Les liaisons dangereuses (and the 18th-century novel it was based on), gussying up a star-studded American cast in corsets and powdered wigs, then setting them loose to do horrid things to one another. Here, Malkovich is at his most impeccably loathsome as the womanizing Valmont, who joins forces with the scheming Marquise de Merteuil (Glenn Close) to defile her cousin’s daughter (played by Uma Thurman). Liaisons is a tragedy, so you know it’ll all end in a mess of death and confusion — but getting there is a delicious good time involving oodles of etiquette, Michelle Pfeiffer at her most luminous, and a side helping of Keanu. A triple Oscar winner, Dangerous Liaisons blended starchy pre-Victorian propriety with good old-fashioned gettin’ down — a mixture that is, in the words of the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson, “Tantalizingly wicked — watching it makes the color rise to your cheeks.”[tomatometer]MovieID=16314[/tomatometer]4. In the Line of FireJohn Malkovich is a fine actor with plenty of awards and a wide variety of roles to his credit, but he’s arguably at his best when playing villains who make your skin crawl — and he used that skill to suitably chilling effect in Wolfgang Petersen’s 1993 hit In the Line of Fire, a thriller pitting Malkovich’s would-be presidential assassin against an aging Secret Service agent (Clint Eastwood) who let down his guard on the day President Kennedy was killed. Audiences made Fire a $176 million smash, and Malkovich received another Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his work as the psychotic Mitch Leary — as well as heaps of praise from critics like ReelViews’ James Berardinelli, who proclaimed, “Hands down, Malkovich’s assassin is the best thing about this solid thriller — a villain that rivals Hannibal Lecter for intelligence and cold, calculated viciousness.”[tomatometer]MovieID=11451[/tomatometer]3. Of Mice and MenDirector (and producer, and co-star) Gary Sinise had some big shoes to fill when he decided to adapt John Steinbeck’s classic Of Mice and Men for the screen — not only is the book beloved, but it had already been turned into a critically lauded film in 1939. Not to mention that the book’s storyline, about a pair of Depression-era farm workers, didn’t have much surface relevance to 1990s filmgoers. But even if most of us haven’t hopped a boxcar or carried a bindle, everyone can relate to Of Mice and Men‘s timeless themes of friendship and hope in the face of despair — and critics certainly responded to Sinise’s brilliantly made adaptation, including Roger Ebert, who wrote, “I would not have thought I could believe the line about the rabbits one more time, but this movie made me do it, as Lennie asks about the farm they’ll own one day, and George says, yes, it will be just as they’ve imagined it.”[tomatometer]MovieID=21421[/tomatometer]2. I’m Going HomeOne of Malkovich’s more quietly acclaimed films, 2001’s I’m Going Home is a French-Portuguese production about an actor named Gilbert Valance (Michael Piccoli) whose life is turned upside down after his wife, daughter, and son-in-law are killed in a car accident. Struggling to stay emotionally afloat, Gilbert puts his career on hiatus and devotes himself to caring for his grandson — until he’s lured into an adaptation of Ulysses by an American director (Malkovich). Though it received only a limited release in the States, I’m Going Home screened in competition at Cannes, and plenty of critics were moved by its quiet grace — including the Chicago Reader’s Jonathan Rosenbaum, who called it “The kind of quiet masterpiece that fully registers only after you’ve seen it.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10801[/tomatometer]1. Places in the HeartMalkovich earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his work in this 1984 drama, which tells the story of a widowed woman (Sally Field) who struggles to keep her Texas farm afloat during the Great Depression. The kind of film whose plot doesn’t seem to cover a lot of ground, but which deals with some unmistakeably weighty themes (in this case racism, adultery, and family commitment), Places in the Heart wasn’t necessarily one of the most exciting pictures of the year, but it was an Academy favorite — Field’s Best Actress win prompted her oft-lampooned “you like me” speech — and a source of admiration for critics like Vincent Canby of the New York Times, who wrote, “Out of the memories of his boyhood in Waxahachie, Tex., during the Great Depression, and within the unlikely tradition of the old-fashioned ‘mortgage’ melodrama, Robert Benton has made one of the best films in years about growing up American.”In case you were wondering, here are Malkovich’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. The Killing Fields — 89%2. Empire of the Sun — 88%3. Rounders — 86%4. Being John Malkovich — 85%5. Changeling — 84%6. Dangerous Liaisons — 84%7. Places in the Heart — 80%8. The Sheltering Sky — 79%9.

But Barrymore’s turbulent youth was just the beginning of a career that has seen her starring in, producing, and even directing some of the most successful films of the last 20 years (not to mention one of the most memorable cameos, courtesy of Scream). With Going the Distance arriving in theaters this weekend, Barrymore is poised to add to her already-impressive $1.5 billion lifetime gross, so we thought now would be the perfect time to take a look back at the brightest critical highlights. It’s time for Total Recall![tomatometer]MovieID=10214[/tomatometer]10. The Wedding SingerA Valentine’s Day romantic comedy with unusually broad appeal, The Wedding Singer offered lonely hearts a chance to cheer along with a jilted (and profanely enraged) Adam Sandler — while still making room for a sweet love story and plenty of vintage 1980s hits on the soundtrack. As mulleted wedding singer Robbie Hart, Sandler proved he was capable of more than the belligerent man-child of Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore; as the doe-eyed cocktail waitress Julia Sullivan, Barrymore was at her most effortlessly charming. A formula picture? Sure. But that was enough for critics like the Globe and Mail’s Liam Lacy, who sighed, “Finally, an Adam Sandler comedy that you can sit through without wanting to throw a mallet through the screen.”[tomatometer]MovieID=11062[/tomatometer]9. Charlie’s AngelsA cheerfully undemanding blockbuster that knows where its popcorn is buttered, Charlie’s Angels was part of an early string of successes for Drew Barrymore’s Flower Films, racking up almost $265 million in worldwide grosses with a savvy blend of stylish action thrills and winking T&amp;A. Throw Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu in some skintight fashion, add a bunch of McG-directed set pieces, and you’ve got yourself an essentially critic-proof movie — but most critics were surprisingly kind to these Angels anyway, including James Berardinelli of ReelViews, who surmised, “You’d have to be a hopeless curmudgeon not to be entertained on some juvenile level by this motion picture.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10831[/tomatometer]8. Stephen King’s Cat’s EyeA year after scoring the title role in the adaptation of Stephen King’s Firestarter, Barrymore reunited with the bestselling horror author for Cat’s Eye, which ties together three of his short stories with the misadventures of a stray cat. Barrymore appeared in the film’s final segment, “The General,” about a girl whose nighttime routine is complicated by the evil designs of a dagger-wielding troll. It sounds a little silly, and it wasn’t a huge hit, but Cat’s Eye has become something of a cult film over time — and it had its defenders while it was in theaters, among them Roger Ebert, who wrote, “Stephen King seems to be working his way through the reference books of human phobias, and Cat’s Eye is one of his most effective films.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13744[/tomatometer]7. Boys on the SideSort of a power trio version of Thelma &amp; Louise, 1995’s Boys on the Side united Barrymore with Whoopi Goldberg and Mary-Louise Parker for a dramedy that incorporated modern themes (sexuality, gender roles, domestic violence) with the old-school craft of director Herbert Ross (Funny Lady, Footloose). While it wasn’t an enormous hit at the box office, it was generally well-received by critics — including Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who wrote, “Despite ads that present it as a giddy romp, Boys on the Side actually proves to be a wistful romance, a sardonic comedy, a Thelma, Edna and Louise tale of sisterly solidarity, and finally a sad, wrenching story that brings Terms of Endearment to mind.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13421[/tomatometer]6. Confessions of a Dangerous MindWas Chuck Barris a secret assassin for the CIA, or just a game show pioneer with an overactive imagination? We’ll probably never know for sure, but the truth matters less than the fact that Barris wrote a wildly entertaining autobiography about his version of events, inspiring screenwriter Charlie Kaufman to adapt it for the screen in 2002. George Clooney made his directorial debut with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, which starred Sam Rockwell as Barris and Drew Barrymore as his long-suffering girlfriend Penny Pacino; like many of Barris’ ideas for television shows, it was destined to sail over the heads of mainstream audiences — and become a cult favorite for fans of flawed, off-kilter entertainment. Among the many critics who appreciated Confessions was Andrew Sarris of the New York Observer, who decreed, “Mr. Clooney, Mr. Kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster.”[tomatometer]MovieID=151436302[/tomatometer]5. Everyone Says I Love YouA Woody Allen musical — starring actors not known for their singing voices? It could have been another misfire from Allen’s scattershot 1990s filmography, but Everyone Says I Love You ended up going down as one of the director’s more satisfying — and surprising — critical triumphs. A winsome romantic comedy that boasts glamorous locations (New York, Venice, and Paris) to match its ensemble cast (Julia Roberts, Ed Norton, and Natalie Portman, to name just a few), Everyone made the most of its stars’ often pedestrian vocal skills — all except Barrymore, who was dubbed; her singing apparently fell short of the limited standards set by Roberts, Norton, and Allen himself. It was all part of the charm for critics like the Boston Phoenix’s Gary Susman, who called the movie “an odd mix of old and new, realism and fantasy, craft and amateurism that shouldn’t work but is inventive and hilarious anyway.”[tomatometer]MovieID=12889[/tomatometer]4. Donnie DarkoPerhaps the definitive cult film of the 21st century, Richard Kelly’s Donnie Darko may not have been made at all if not for Drew Barrymore, who assisted its bumpy passage to theaters by releasing the twisty time-traveling thriller as a Flower Films production. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a troubled teen who may or may not have the power to save the universe, and featuring a wildly eclectic supporting cast that included Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Ashley Tisdale, Seth Rogen, and Noah Wyle, Darko was probably destined to end its theatrical run with a whimper — but nearly a decade after its release, its stature has grown to match the applause of critics like Salon’s Andrew O’Hehir, who called it “A stunning technical accomplishment that virtually bursts with noise, ideas and references.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770785797[/tomatometer]3. Whip ItBarrymore cut her teeth as a producer in the 1990s, releasing hits (like Never Been Kissed and Charlie’s Angels) and passion projects (like Donnie Darko) through her Flower Films banner, but it wasn’t until 2009’s Whip It that she made her directorial debut. Adapted by Shauna Cross from her novel Derby Girl, Whip It follows the journey of disgruntled beauty queen Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) as she discovers her love for roller derby as a member of the Hurl Scouts, a team of perennial losers whose ranks include lovable misfits like Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig) and Smashley Simpson (Barrymore). A minor commercial success, Whip It earned the affection of critics like Mary Pols of Time Magazine, who wrote, “Even if a tale of female empowerment through roller derby is not your particular cup of tea, Barrymore delivers it with such a giddy good sense of fun that it’s easy enough to go along with.”[tomatometer]MovieID=11509[/tomatometer]2. Ever After – A Cinderella StoryBlending a timeless tale with modern music and a post-feminist twist, Andy Tennant’s Ever After helped cement Drew Barrymore’s grip on the box office in 1998 — between this $65 million summer hit and the runaway success of The Wedding Singer in the spring, it was the Year of Drew. Ever After was a sizable critical hit, too, thanks to a sharp screenplay, its solid cast (Anjelica Huston as the evil stepmother? Gold) and the classic source material that inspired it. As Lisa Schwarzbaum applauded for Entertainment Weekly, “A Cinderella without mice as coachmen … had better have a mighty fine excuse for tampering with a successful formula. Against many odds, Ever After comes up with a good one.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10489[/tomatometer]1. E.T. – The Extra-TerrestrialNo surprises here, right? A modern classic that added another jewel to Spielberg’s crown, earned nine Oscar nominations, and created millions of Reese’s Pieces fans, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial also launched Drew Barrymore’s career in earnest. Although she’d been in commercials and films before (most notably a small supporting role in Altered States), Barrymore shone in E.T.; thanks to her preternatural screen presence and the great lines handed to her character by Melissa Mathison’s script, she walked away from the movie a certified star. Although the films that immediately followed weren’t always successful (including Firestarter and Irreconcilable Differences), it’s still easy to look back at E.T. and see the talent that would eventually help make Barrymore one of Hollywood’s most bankable talents — and to see why the world fell in love with the story of a lonely young boy and his lost alien friend. As Anthony Lane wrote for the New Yorker, “We have yet to recover from [Spielberg’s] revelation: that there is nothing more real than sitting in your own back yard — waiting for the unreal to come down, take a handful of candy, and fly you to the moon.”In case you were wondering, here are Barrymore’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1.

In fact, Burlesque stars two of them: musical legend/Oscar winner Cher and — making her big-screen debut — Christina Aguilera. To celebrate all this girl power, we decided to spend this week’s feature taking a look back at some of of the most noteworthy female double threats in Hollywood history. From the Billboard charts to the box office, it’s time for Total Recall![tomatometer]MovieID=770803691[/tomatometer]Mariah CareyThe Opening Act: If you’re old enough to remember 1990, you probably don’t need any help recalling Mariah Carey’s introduction to the world: the smash hit “Vision of Love,” which blended an old-school torch ballad melody with tastefully modern production — and allowed her to showcase her five-octave range in the process. For the rest of the decade, the charts belonged to Mariah…so when the 21st century rolled around, taking her to Hollywood seemed like a natural progression, right?Perfect Pitch: Precious (2009, 91 percent) Given the rather dubious reception afforded her earlier forays into the acting world (as well as her glamorous image), it came as a real shock to see a makeup-free Carey turning up in a supporting role in one of the most critically lauded movies of 2009 — and earning some solid reviews in the process. But that’s exactly what happened with Precious, which earned Carey a variety of awards nominations (including a nod from the Screen Actors Guild) for her portrayal of a social worker. As Carrie Rickey noted for the Philadelphia Inquirer, “Harrowing and marked by heroic performances, Lee Daniels’ Precious looks squarely in the wounded eyes of its title character and sees a girl with poetry in her.”Wrong Notes: Glitter (2001, 7 percent) When you make your Hollywood debut by producing and starring in a movie that’s supposed to be loosely based on your own life, you’re pretty much laying it all on the line. So let us applaud Mariah Carey for the chutzpah it required to film Glitter, the notorious bomb so toxic that it actually seemed, for a time, as though Carey’s career might be over. Followed by a series of profound embarrassments — the MTV striptease, the hospital stay, the EMI contract buyout — Glitter was the subject of withering scorn from critics like the AP’s Christy Lemire, who wrote, “The best parts of this dud are the ones in which she’s singing. This is what she does best. This is what she should stick to. Save your money and watch her videos for free on cable music-television networks.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10256[/tomatometer]CherThe Opening Act: Cher famously got her start in the early 1960s through Sonny Bono, who worked for the legendary producer Phil Spector and was able to score some background vocal dates for the two of them (including “You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling,” “Da Doo Ron Ron,” and “Be My Baby”) before they struck out on their own. After a few false starts with unsuccessful singles, they released “I Got You Babe” in 1965, and the rest was history — Cher started landing small movie and TV roles almost immediately, followed by the duo’s Emmy-nominated variety show and her long film career.Perfect Pitch: Mask (1985, 92 percent) and Moonstruck (1987, 92 percent). The former earned Cher a Golden Globe and a Cannes Best Actress award for her portrayal of a fiercely protective, deeply flawed mother; the latter, a quintessential 1980s romantic comedy, brought her a Best Actress Oscar. Really, throughout the 1980s, Cher displayed remarkably sharp instincts for choosing scripts — her remarkable run during the decade included Silkwood, The Witches of Eastwick, and Suspect.Wrong Notes: Faithful (1996, 7 percent), an adaptation of the play by Chazz Palminteri about a semi-suicidal housewife (Cher) whose adulterous husband (Ryan O’Neal) hires a hit man (Palminteri) to kill her. It sounds like the setup for some wonderfully black comedy, but critics came away disappointed, including Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who called it “mostly flat,” “thin and claustrophobic,” and “oddly bland.”[tomatometer]MovieID=8468157[/tomatometer]Lena HorneThe Opening Act: A four-time Grammy winner and unqualified musical legend, Lena Horne was equally at home on stage (where she won a Tony) or in front of the cameras (as evidenced by her Emmy nomination). If not for the institutionalized racism she faced early in her career — or the Hollywood blacklisting she endured in the 1950s — Horne may have spent her career dividing her time between movies and the recording studio; as it was, she only made a handful of films. Fortunately, she made most of them count.Perfect Pitch: Horne had a part in Till the Clouds Roll By (1946, 100 percent), a loose musical biopic of composer Jerome Kern, but her work in Cabin in the Sky (1943, 80 percent) is more noteworthy — not only because she had a leading role as part of her precedent-setting deal with MGM, but because the movie had an all-black cast during a time when that meant many theaters would simply refuse to show it. For those who saw it, this Vincente Minnelli-directed musical adaptation of the legend of Faust was a thoroughly charming, albeit somewhat broad, diversion; as Rick J. Thompson wrote for Senses of Cinema, “The performances are required to be charming, deft, and knowing in order to offset the stage devices and camp of it all, and they are.”Wrong Notes: The Wiz (1978, 37 percent) Remaking The Wizard of Oz with a modern R&amp;B spin was an idea with a certain amount of charm, and it worked on Broadway; unfortunately, little of that charm made its way to the screen with Sidney Lumet’s adaptation of The Wiz, starring Diana Ross as Dorothy, Nipsey Russell as the Tin Man, Richard Pryor as the Wizard, Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow, and Horne as Glinda the Good Witch. Despite its undeniably interesting cast, The Wiz never came close to earning back its record-breaking budget; it is, in the words of Juicy Cerebellum’s Alex Sandell, “so bad it’s good, but not so good that I’d say that it isn’t bad.”[tomatometer]MovieID=358047697[/tomatometer]Beyoncé KnowlesThe Opening Act: If you watched MTV or listened to Top 40 radio in the late 1990s, it was almost impossible to avoid Destiny’s Child, the R&amp;B group whose hits included “No, No, No,” “Bills, Bills, Bills,” “Jumpin’, Jumpin’,” and, of course, “Bootylicious.” By 2004, Destiny’s Child was on indefinite hiatus, but Beyoncé had a career of her own to focus on — both in the recording studio (15 Top 40 hits and 10 million albums sold) and on the big screen.Perfect Pitch: Dreamgirls (2006, 78 percent) Beyoncé tackled comedy with her cinematic debut, 2002’s Austin Powers in Goldmember, but she proved she could also handle drama with this Oscar-winning adaptation of the Broadway play about the rise and fall of a vocal group (Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, and Anika Noni Rose) whose friendships are tested by the trappings of fame. Though some critics were disappointed by Dreamgirls‘ simple plot and rather loosely drawn characters, it worked where it counted — the songs and dancing — and earned Hudson an Academy Award while proving Eddie Murphy can still act.Wrong Notes: Obsessed (2009, 20 percent). Beyoncé, Idris Elba, and Ali Larter have all been in well-received movies and/or TV shows on their own — but when they came together, the result was a hackneyed thriller about an unbalanced administrative assistant (Larter) whose unhealthy fixation with her boss (Elba) puts her on a collision course to illegal hijinks and an epic catfight with his wife (Knowles). A medium-sized hit at the box office, Obsessed overcame scornful reviews from the likes of the Times’ Wendy Ide, who called it “execrable” and “a fist-chewing embarrassment that has no right to a theatrical release.”[tomatometer]MovieID=460339382[/tomatometer]Queen LatifahThe Opening Act: With her 1989 debut album, All Hail the Queen, Latifah helped blaze a trail for female artists in the male dominated hip-hop world; alongside artists like MC Lyte, Salt-N-Pepa, and JJ Fad, she opened the door for future generations of performers — and that wasn’t enough. By 1991, she’d started opening doors in Hollywood, with roles in films (starting with House Party 2) and television (the sitcom Living Single); just over a decade later, she had an Oscar nomination under her belt for her work in Chicago.Perfect Pitch: Hairspray (2007, 91 percent) It shouldn’t have worked — a theatrical adaptation of a musical based on a John Waters movie, the 2007 version of Hairspray arrived in theaters as a second-generation copy of an almost 20-year-old story, complete with a cross-dressing John Travolta in a fat suit. But the new Hairspray, directed by Adam Shankman and bolstered by a cast rounded out by Christopher Walken, Zac Efron, Michelle Pfeiffer, Nikki Blonsky, and Latifah, earned more than $200 million, along with praise from critics including Paste Magazine’s Tim Basham, who called it “The most refreshing and enjoyable musical of this century.”Wrong Notes: The Cookout (2004, 5 percent) Released the same year as the hellish Latifah/Jimmy Fallon vehicle Taxi, this ensemble comedy united one of the oddest casts in recent memory (including Ja Rule, Farrah Fawcett, Eve, Jonathan Silverman, and Latifah’s mother) and a script developed by the Queen herself to produce a spectacular critical and commercial misfire that grossed only $12 million and earned scornful reviews from writers like Jim Lane of the Sacramento News &amp; Review, who scoffed, “Director Lance Rivera has never directed a movie before, and he doesn’t start here.”[tomatometer]MovieID=15475[/tomatometer]Courtney LoveThe Opening Act: Love is actually something of an actress-turned-singer-turned-actress — she appeared briefly in a handful of films during the 1980s, including Sid &amp; Nancy — but it wasn’t until she strapped on a guitar and founded Hole that her career really took off. After hitting the charts, it didn’t take long for Love to return to acting — only this time, her fame meant she had a shot at bigger roles.Perfect Pitch: The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996, 87 percent) Love’s loud, trashy image made her a natural choice for a biopic about the Hustler publisher — but few suspected just how eagerly she’d rise to the challenge of playing Flynt’s wife Althea. It was a role that required a full spectrum of emotions, from manic comedy to tragedy, and Love walked away with it — as well as a Golden Globe nomination and enthusiastic reviews from critics like Rob Blackwelder of SPLICEDWire, who exclaimed, “Wow. Courtney Love can act.”Wrong Notes: Trapped (2002, 18 percent) She filmed a small part in the 1996 turkey Feeling Minnesota, but in terms of major roles, Love’s acting career hit its nadir with this thriller about a psychopath (Kevin Bacon) and his wife (Love) who kidnap the young daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a successful physician (Stuart Townsend). It was based on a bestselling novel, but that didn’t help Trapped at the box office, where it grossed barely $7 million — or with critics like Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum, who bitterly dismissed it as “a negligible work of manipulation, an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents.”[tomatometer]MovieID=11353[/tomatometer]MadonnaThe Opening Act: Madonna embarked on a solo recording career in 1982, quickly scoring a dance hit with her debut single and setting the stage for a dominating chart run that lasted well into the 1990s. But music superstardom wasn’t enough for Madonna — by 1985, she’d gone Hollywood with a cameo in the high school wrestling drama Vision Quest and scored her first leading role, with the critical and commercial success Desperately Seeking Susan.Perfect Pitch: Desperately Seeking Susan (1985, 87 percent) It’s always sort of unfortunate when an actor’s first film ends up going down as their best, and Madonna surely believed Desperately Seeking Susan was just the beginning of a long and successful acting career — but even if most of her subsequent movies flopped, this comedy about a bored housewife (Rosanna Arquette) who assumes the identity of a free spirit (Madonna) was a winner with critics like Roger Ebert, who said, “It has its moments, and many of them involve the different kinds of special appeal that Arquette and Madonna are able to generate.”Wrong Notes: Swept Away (2002, 5 percent) Oh dear. Almost a decade after it was released, it’s still hard to believe anyone responsible for Swept Away really thought it was a good idea. Written and directed by Guy Ritchie, this remake of the 1974 film about an irritating woman (Madonna) shipwrecked on a deserted island with the first mate (Adriano Giannini) was an unqualified bomb, grossing less than $600,000 and earning five Razzies (including Worst Picture and Worst Actress). Calling her “the Vera Hruba Ralston of her time,” Variety’s Dennis Harvey made the bewildered observation, “Madonna has persisted in making movies despite all evidence that this is one medium in which no one wants to see or hear her.”[tomatometer]MovieID=11245[/tomatometer]Bette MidlerThe Opening Act: Midler famously found the spotlight as part of a New York City bathhouse duo with Barry Manilow, who produced her 1972 debut album, The Divine Miss M. She’d tasted fame before that, however, as a member of plays both off-Broadway (Miss Nefertiti Regrets) and on (The Fiddler on the Roof) — all of which helped prepare her for chart- and box office-topping reign during the 1970s and 1980s, when she juggled hit films like Down and Out in Beverly Hills with radio favorites such as “Wind Beneath My Wings” and “From a Distance.”Perfect Pitch: Ruthless People (1986, 90 percent) A rare straight comedy from the Zucker/Abrams/Zucker team, Ruthless People follows the misadventures of a greedy millionaire (Danny DeVito) who plans to have his wife (Midler) murdered, only to discover that she’s been taken by a pair of kidnappers (Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater) who have no idea what they’re in for. Like 1979’s The Rose (which earned her an Oscar nomination), it left plenty of room for Midler’s larger-than-life talent to shine, and audiences were all the richer for it.Wrong Notes: Big Business (1988, 25 percent) This Lily Tomlin collaboration matched Midler’s other 1988 live-action release, Beaches, for critical futility — but where Beaches earned Midler a #1 single and a pair of Grammys, before turning into a Kleenex-dampening cult favorite, Big Business just sort of limped away from the box office and was forgotten. It’s a shame, given the talent assembled, but the ham-scented comedy and farcical plot (about a pair of twins mixed up at birth) don’t really take advantage of either star’s gifts. As Roger Ebert observed, “This is not funny. It is never funny, in this movie or any other movie.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10371[/tomatometer]2. Mandy MooreThe Opening Act: Moore rose to prominence as part of the teen dance-pop craze of the late 1990s, scoring her first hit at the tender age of 15 with “Candy.” After making a few minor inroads on Top 40 radio, Moore turned away from the trendy sounds of the day, opting for more introspective (and less commercially successful) recordings while expanding the acting career she kicked off with 2002’s A Walk to Remember.Perfect Pitch: Saved (2003, 61 percent) After leading roles in a string of fairly innocuous teen-oriented films, Moore played against type as the main antagonist in Brian Dannelly’s Saved!, a religious satire about a high school student (Jena Malone) whose boyfriend (Chad Faust) tells her he’s gay, setting in motion a chain of events that puts them on a collision course with a popular, self-righteous classmate (Moore). Though reviews weren’t overwhelmingly positive, Moore’s performance was generally singled out for praise, and it gave her a chance to flash comedic chops with a sharp, bittersweet script.Wrong Notes: Because I Said So (2006, 5 percent) Mandy Moore with Diane Keaton and Lauren Graham in a romantic comedy — it should have been a match made in chick flick heaven, right? Nope. Because I Said So — about the struggles of a neurotic mother (Keaton) to relate to her three daughters (Moore, Graham, and Piper Perabo) — was one of the bigger flops of 2007, both with audiences (who ignored it to the tune of a $42 million gross) and critics like Richard Roeper, who stated simply, “I hated this movie.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10080[/tomatometer]Olivia Newton-JohnThe Opening Act: Olivia Newton-John started her recording career in the mid 1960s, but things didn’t really start taking off for her until the early 1970s, when her cover of Bob Dylan’s “If Not for You” and the Grammy-winning “Let Me Be There” turned the Australian-born singer into a rather unlikely favorite on the American country music charts — and that was before she ruled the pop charts with the record-setting “Physical.”Perfect Pitch: Grease (1978, 83 percent) She had her doubts about playing a high school student at the ripe old age of 29, but Newton-John needn’t have worried — despite the fact that the “kids” in the cast were all too old for their roles, Grease quickly became the top-grossing movie of the year (and one of the most successful musicals of all time), thanks in large part to the singin’, dancin’ chemistry enjoyed by Olivia and her on-screen beau, John Travolta. Subsequent attempts to revive the musical weren’t so lucky (including the Newton-John-led Xanadu), but Grease‘s appeal was too much for even Vincent Canby to deny, as he admitted when he wrote, “Its sensibility is not tied to the past but to a free-wheeling, well informed, high-spirited present.”Wrong Notes: Two of a Kind (1983, 20 percent) A mere five years after they scored a smash hit with Grease, Newton-John and Travolta reunited for this notorious bomb, a comedy about a failed inventor (Travolta) who discovers that his desperate attempt to rob a bank has been foiled by a duplicitous teller (Newton-John) who pocketed the money for herself — and how their love is all that stands between the Earth and its utter destruction by a vengeful God (Gene Hackman). Doesn’t sound like something you’d ever want to see? Think again, advises Scott Weinberg of eFilmCritic: “The ‘wow’ kind of bad that people still talk about 20 years after the fact. Rent it and see.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

This time, Snow’s on the road with a record company intern (played by Jonah Hill) charged with keeping him on the straight and narrow — a classic comedy setup that got us thinking about the many hard-living men and women who have entertained us with their movie antics. Naturally, we had to make a list, and you know what that means…it’s time to get down with our favorite party animals (presented in alphabetical order) Total Recall style!Animal (the Muppet movies)You can’t say “party animal” without saying “Animal” — and we couldn’t have published this list without some mention of the furry bundle of percussive energy that is the Electric Mayhem’s longtime drummer. While hardly the most eloquent Muppet, Animal has a unique charm, undeniable drumming skills, and a bursting enthusiasm for life that is best reflected in his trademark mating cry of “WO-MAN! WO-MAN!” Though he’s usually kept chained to something or other — and for obvious reasons — Animal has also helped save the day for his friends on more than one occasion, proving that even the most focused partier is interested in more than just good times.Special Attributes: Impeccable rhythmic timing; impressive facial hairNotable Achievement: Grew to giant size to scare off the nefarious Doc HopperArthur Bach (Arthur)About as lovable an alcoholic as any you’ll find on the silver screen, Arthur Bach (Dudley Moore) masked his loneliness and poor self-esteem by piddling away his family’s massive fortune on booze and hookers — at least until he met Linda Marolla (Liza Minelli), the salt-of-the-earth waitress who deepened Arthur’s doubts about his impending arranged marriage to the heiress Susan Johnson (Jill Eikenberry). Okay, so he doesn’t seem like a barrel of laughs on paper, but to meet Arthur is to be charmed by him; beneath all that irresponsible behavior and constant drunken cackling beat the heart of an unrepentant romantic who was willing to forsake a $750 million inheritance for true love. (Of course, he eventually got to have his cake and eat it too. It was the 1980s, after all.)Special Attributes: Hobson (John Gielgud), butler extraordinaire and the coolest sidekick any party animal could ever hope forNotable Achievement: Made millions of people seriously question what they would do if they were caught between the moon and New York CityBeetlejuice (Beetlejuice)What happens when you love partying even more than life itself? No one knows for sure, but you just might end up like Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), the irrepressible spirit who refused to let death stand between himself and a good time. Summoned into the temporal realm by the recently deceased Maitlands (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) to help them get rid of the snobbish clan that’s recently moved into their home, Beetlejuice gets the party started, leading a forced Harry Belafonte singalong from beyond the grave and nearly blackmailing a young Winona Ryder into marrying him before he’s swallowed by a giant sandworm. And you thought last week’s kegger was wild? Pshaw.Special Attributes: Magic powers; great taste in kitschy retro tunesNotable Achievement: Returned to life to become a recurring guest on The Howard Stern ShowJohn “Bluto” Blutarsky (National Lampoon’s Animal House)Party animals come and go, but there will never be another John “Bluto” Blutarsky (John Belushi), the seven-year college phenomenon who, before he turned his incredible 0.0 GPA into a career in the United States Senate, built an unrivaled legend on the campus of Faber College. Whether he was urinating in public, starting food fights, or demonstrating the slimming effects of a toga, Bluto displayed a rakish contempt for authority as wide and deep as his hunger for sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll. But what made Bluto truly special was his innate understanding that hedonism isn’t just about pleasurable pursuits, it’s a celebration of brotherhood. When his fellow Delta Tau Chi members were reduced to despair after having their charter revoked, it was Bluto who delivered one of the most impassioned — and effective — pep talks in film history.Special Attributes: Does an incredible impression of a popping zit; gave new meaning to the phrase “perfect GPA”Notable Achievement: Revealed that it was, in fact, actually the Germans who bombed Pearl HarborRon Burgundy (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy)Forget about rock stars and professional athletes — as Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) proved, all the best parties are reserved for your local anchorman, at least if he’s as coolly mustachioed as this Scotch-loving titan of the airwaves. And who can blame the ladies for loving Ron, what with his many leisure suits, immaculately coiffed hair, or skill with the jazz flute? Though his views might be outdated when it comes to gender roles, Ron isn’t shy about showing his sensitive side — and whether he’s hurtling into a swinger-filled pool or urging his viewers to stay classy, he’s always ready to cut loose.Special Attributes: Unbeatable street-brawling technique; Spanish-speaking dogNotable Achievement: Uncovered the true meaning of the words “San Diego”Caligula (Caligula)Depending upon your tolerance for things like occultism, incest, random executions, and government-mandated prostitution, Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) might strike you as more of a depraved maniac than a party animal, but there’s no denying that at least during the early portion of his reign, the young emperor was a pretty swinging guy, ushering in a new era of freedom and comity for the Roman Empire. Of course, that was before he made it his mission to destroy the senatorial class and plunged the nation into a nightmarish turmoil of war and destruction, but while the good times lasted, Caligula really wasn’t half-bad — for a guy who wanted to marry his sister, anyway.Special Attributes: Ambitious; irresistible to blackbirdsNotable Achievement: Lowered taxesDave Chappelle (Dave Chappelle’s Block Party)The advent of digital music has made it possible for anyone to be a DJ, but the art of truly rocking a party remains a skill shared by a chosen few. Case in point: Dave Chappelle, the vanishing comedian whose 2004 Brooklyn block party was immortalized in Michel Gondry’s 2006 documentary, the aptly named Dave Chappelle’s Block Party. What made it so amazing? In a word, the music: Chappelle’s lineup for the day included Kanye West, Erykah Badu, the Roots (who served as the world’s coolest house band), Mos Def, Jill Scott, and a reunited Fugees, with Chappelle himself supplying between-set comedy. So the next time you’re sweating over the song transitions in your barbecue mix, just remember — you can save yourself a lot of effort just by putting this movie on and turning it up loud.Special Attributes: Ability to lure Lauryn Hill out of seclusion; Rolodex stuffed with modern soul and hip-hop greatsNotable Achievement: The whole darn thing, reallyShelley Darlington (The House Bunny)As anyone who’s ever seen a picture taken at Hugh Hefner’s mansion could tell you, the life of a Playboy bunny is filled with parties — but what happens after a bunny is forced to enter the real world? For Shelley Darlington (Anna Faris), cruelly tricked into giving up her bunny ears by a duplicitous rival, the answer involved seeking out a location almost as party-filled as the Playboy Mansion: college. As a house mother for the dowdy sisters of the Zeta Alpha Zeta sorority, Shelley did the public service of sharing her partying skills with a whole new generation, and helped a few girls unleash their inner fabulousness; along the way, she also learned something about herself, but that was sort of an accident.Special Attributes: Irrepressibly bubbly personality; looks great in pinkNotable Achievement: Rounded up 30 last-minute recruits to single-handedly save the ZAZ sororityDoctor Detroit (Doctor Detroit)Even the dullest homebody sometimes dreams of being the life of the party; it can just be hard to break through that wall of shyness. In fact, sometimes it takes the invention of a wig-wearing, metal-gloved, funny-voiced alter ego to discover one’s hidden party animal. Take, for example, the case of Clifford Skridlow (Dan Aykroyd), the mild-mannered professor who was bamboozled into impersonating the non-existent business partner of a pimp (Howard Hesseman) who’s on the run from a tough-as-nails crime boss nicknamed “Mom” (Kate Murtagh). Sure, the risks were high. Sure, the script was awful. But did Clifford Skridlow let those minor obstacles keep him from getting down with his bad self as the outlandish Doctor Detroit? He did not.Special Attributes: Awesome metal glove; mesmerizing, vaguely Elton John-ish wigNotable Achievement: United James Brown and Devo for one of the more eclectic soundtracks to come out of the 1980sRaoul Duke (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas)Charles Darwin wasn’t thinking of party animals when he wrote about the theory of evolution, but it’s just as applicable to them — and we have our proof in the form of Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), the pseudonym given by Hunter S. Thompson to his hedonistic, illegal substance-ingesting, iconoclastic id. Duke’s evolutionary leap in partying included subjecting his body to an epic assortment of drugs, from household names like marijuana to exotic hallucinogenics like adrenochrome, as well as a knack for seeking out some of the most notoriously unsafe environments of the late 1960s and early 1970s (riots, Vietnam, the Hell’s Angels). Turned loose on the Strip in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Duke behaves pretty much as you’d expect, suffering a variety of hallucinations, multiple blackouts, and a brush with orangutan ownership — not to mention narrowly avoiding arrest and/or death.Special Attributes: Bottomless appetite for drugs; looks snappy in Wellington boots and a fake lizard tailNotable Achievement: Drove directly onto the tarmac of the Las Vegas airport to keep his friend Dr. Gonzo (Benicio del Toro) from missing a flightJabba the Hutt (Return of the Jedi)He couldn’t walk, he didn’t have much of a personality, and his singing voice was nothing to brag about, but Jabba the Hutt never wanted for company. So what made this giant, malevolent, sluglike creature so popular? Simple: He knew how to throw a party. Whether he was treating his guests to the dulcet tones of the Max Rebo Band, thrilling them by feeding unpopular acquaintances to the Rancor Monster or tossing them in the Sarlacc Pit, or providing eye candy in the form of metal-bikini’d slave girls, Jabba made sure there was never a dull moment at his palace. Of course, things could get pretty messy once you found yourself off the guest list, but it’s all about having fun while it lasts, right?Special Attributes: Awesome droid collection; head-tentacled albino sidekickNotable Achievement: Forever altered the way millions of pre-teen boys looked at Princess LeiaSamantha Jones (the Sex and the City movies)More than anyone, Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) put the Sex in Sex and the City. Through countless flings, a transcontinental move, and a cancer scare, Samantha has maintained an admirable willingness to try anything once — including many things that can’t be mentioned in this article. But in spite of her freewheeling rep, Samantha is about much more than simply good times and one-night stands; she’s also a fiercely loyal friend, and unlike the many party animals that carry on in an effort to stave off adult responsibilities, her pursuit of pleasure is grounded in an unapologetic love of self. Her love life might have all the ingredients for a good filthy limerick, but all Samantha Jones really wants is…well, everything, really. Who can’t identify with that?Special Attributes: Shockingly extensive wardrobe; public relations expertiseNotable Achievement: Survived menopauseKid ‘n’ Play (the House Party movies)Okay, so we probably would never have known who they were if DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince hadn’t been busy — and someone really should have put the House Party franchise to a halt long before 2001’s dreaded House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute. But 20 years after they brought the hi-top fade to its logical conclusion, it’s impossible not to miss Kid n’ Play, or the days when a disagreement could be settled by breaking out the Funky Charleston during a good old-fashioned dance battle. (They said they “Ain’t Gonna Hurt Nobody” and they meant it.) Besides, how many members of this list can brag about rapping their way out of a jail cell?Special Attributes: Signature, easy-to-learn dance moveNotable Achievement: With House Party 2, briefly made pajama parties respectable for adultsThe Mad Hatter (Alice in Wonderland)Most party animals favor beverages quite a bit stronger than tea, but even if he prefers a bit of Earl Grey to whatever’s in the punchbowl, the Mad Hatter has something most of his peers don’t — namely, a mind so cracked that he has no problem running around a table during all-day tea parties. Mad though he might be, the Hatter is a good friend to have; not only can he keep your head stylishly covered, but he’ll celebrate your un-birthday 364 days of the year. Besides, who needs alcohol when you’ve got a talking rabbit at the table?Special Attributes: Ability to bend the laws of physics to his will; good at coming up with riddlesNotable Achievement: Cheered up the Queen of Hearts with a well-timed un-birthday partyMary (Party Girl)There comes a time in the life of every party animal when his or her commitment to the lifestyle is tested so severely that they either have to find a new way of partying or give it up completely. For Mary (Parker Posey), that point came after her arrest for her involvement in an underground rave — but rather than walking away from the clubs, she ended up stumbling into a career as one of the hippest, most fashion-forward librarians on the planet. Moral of the story: Don’t be surprised if you hear the faint echoes of a club beat the next time you’re browsing the stacks. You never know what the quiet person behind the circulation desk is doing after hours.Special Attributes: Entrepreneurial spirit; discount at Mustafa’s falafel standNotable Achievement: Learned the Dewey Decimal SystemThornton Melon (Back to School)Well past the age when most party animals have hung up their kegs, Thornton Melon (Rodney Dangerfield) was just coming into his own as the oldest undergrad at Grand Lakes University. A self-made millionaire without a high school diploma, Melon didn’t go to college to learn; he bought his way in so he could keep a closer eye on his son Jason (Keith Gordon) — and party. (Probably not in that order, either.) Over the course of a single semester, Melon bankrolled a new School of Business for the university, wooed a professor (Sally Kellerman), and hired Kurt Vonnegut to write an essay about one of his own books, all while offering his fellow students a master class in the art of carousing — and if all that weren’t enough, he even showed up to save the day at the school’s big swim meet.Special Attributes: Virtually unlimited financial resources; unshaven, wisecracking chauffeurNotable Achievement: Landed a perfect “Triple Lindy” at the age of 65Austin Powers (the Austin Powers movies)Every party animal is different, but if there’s one characteristic they all share, it’s probably the ability to project an air of self-confidence — and no one has embodied this more than Austin Powers (Mike Myers), the secret agent whose mojo survived cryogenic freezing, time travel, and the nefarious machinations of the accurately named Dr. Evil. Cheerfully unaware of his outdated wardrobe, crooked teeth, or plentiful body hair, Austin has devoted himself to the relentless pursuit of the opposite sex, and he’s been nothing if not successful, shagging Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), and Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), just to name a few. He may not have matinee-idol looks, but thanks to his swinging pad, charming personality, and overabundance of pheromones, Powers represents an unattainable ideal for party animals everywhere.Special Attributes: Legendary mojo, unerring ability to determine what is or is not his bag, babyNotable Achievement: Participated in a ménage à trois with Felicity Shagwell and a past version of himselfFrank “the Tank” Ricard (Old School)Like most college keg-killers, Frank “The Tank” Ricard (Will Ferrell) sobered up and tried to be respectable after graduating — but old habits are hard to break, and not even threats of divorce from his increasingly apoplectic newlywed wife were enough to keep the essentially good-hearted Frank from unleashing his beer-thirsty alter ego after his best friend Mitch (Luke Wilson) tried to cope with a nasty breakup by starting his own fraternity. Reverting to his old ways did eventually cost Frank his marriage, but it was only through regression that he was able to achieve self-acceptance — and hook up with freaky Heidi (Juliette Lewis).Special Attributes: Tremendous skill with a beer bong; ability to take a horse tranquilizer dart to the jugular with no lasting physical damageNotable Achievement: Took “streaking the quad” to a whole new levelTony Stark (the Iron Man movies)If you were going to be a filthy rich industrialist who beat up on bad guys in your spare time, would you choose the grim, tortured life of Bruce Wayne, a.k.a. Batman, or would you step into Tony Stark’s shiny boots and take to the skies as Iron Man? Yeah, we thought so. Like every superhero, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has his problems — but unlike most of them, he actually knows how to have fun once in awhile, and takes full advantage of his celebrity status. Sure, he’s got a bum ticker, and he definitely needs to lay off the sauce. What is partying for, though, if not celebrating the here and now in spite of what might bring us down tomorrow? Whether or not you enjoy Stark-sized levels of wealth and fame, he offers a suave object lesson for the billionaire playboy in us all.Special Attributes: Snazzy facial hair; AI “butler” with Paul Bettany’s voiceNotable Achievement: Built a freakin’ flying suit of armorSteve Stifler (the American Pie movies)Unlike some of the other names on our list, Steve Stifler wasn’t the kind of person who needed to party to blow off steam or experiment with mind-altering substances; for him, the partying lifestyle was always a means to an end — specifically, to be around as many young, inebriated girls as possible. While this isn’t a particularly noble mission, it’s easy to understand, and Stifler deserves to be commended for the increasingly absurd lengths he went to in pursuit of his goal. Initially, Stifler was only willing to forget about the fairer sex for as long as it took to finish lacrosse practice or devise some new way of tormenting his nemesis Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), but over time, he revealed a more sensitive — albeit every bit as sex-obsessed — side of his personality. Though Stifler’s been off-screen since the final moments of 2003’s American Wedding, recent American Pie sequels have introduced viewers to other members of his apparently massive family, and revealed that the Stifmeister eventually landed his dream gig as a director of pornographic movies.Special Attributes: Willingness to engage in any activity in order to view female nudity; son of the infamous Stifler’s Mom (Jennifer Coolidge)Notable Achievement: Fished a wedding ring out of a dog dropping — and then placed said dropping into his own mouth — in order to demonstrate his affection for the lovely Cadence Flaherty (January Jones)Withnail (Withnail and I)He probably isn’t the first character that comes to mind when you think of party animals; in fact, he begins and ends his on-screen adventures in poverty and despair, and spends most of his time in isolation with his best friend Marwood (Paul McGann). Withnail (Richard E. Grant) deserves a spot on this list, however, if for no reason other than his animal thirst for alcohol, which is so incredible that it’s spawned its own drinking game. (One which, it must be said, is more than a little dangerous; trying to match Withnail drink-for-drink could put a person in the hospital, or worse.) Though he probably doesn’t receive many invitations, it seems safe to assume Withnail could be the life of the party…at least as long as the booze keeps flowing.Special Attributes: Easy access to his uncle’s country cottage; superhuman tolerance of controlled substancesNotable Achievement: None — he’s still waiting for his big breakTake a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

But there’s an exception for every rule, and although her filmography is not without its share of failures (Love Happens, anyone?), Jennifer Aniston has shown an impressive ability to balance commercial hits (The Break-Up) with critical winners (The Good Girl). With her latest effort, the action comedy The Bounty Hunter, hitting theaters this weekend, we took the opportunity to look back at the ten best-reviewed films from Hollywood’s favorite Friend. It’s Total Recall time!Bruce Almighty (2003)  48%Cool, high-concept idea aside, Bruce Almighty isn’t a movie that tries to do anything out of the ordinary — it represented a return to safely top-grossing comedic form for Jim Carrey, who reunited with his Ace Ventura director Tom Shadyac, and both Morgan Freeman (who played God) and Jennifer Aniston (who played Bruce’s cutely exasperated girlfriend, Grace) played strongly to type in their supporting roles. Still, what works often works for a reason, and Bruce Almighty‘s outlandish $484 million gross demonstrated that sometimes, people just want to see their favorite stars do the stuff they’ve done well before. Most critics found Almighty less than heavenly, but that’s often been true of Carrey’s comedies — and some scribes found the humor in this tale of an ordinary guy who gets to run the universe while God’s on vacation, including Bill Clark of From the Balcony, who wrote, “Bruce Almighty is the kind of movie that Jim Carrey should stick to.”The Object of My Affection (1998)  52%Several months before Will &amp; Grace kicked off its lengthy run, Aniston co-starred in the somewhat similarly themed The Object of My Affection, about a social worker who impulsively offers to rent a room to a new acquaintance (Paul Rudd) — and then proceeds to fall in love with him despite knowing he’s gay. It might sound like fairly standard rom-com stuff, with a potentially offensive twist — or it might just remind you of plot strands from My Best Friend’s Wedding and The Next Best Thing — and a number of critics did indeed dismiss Affection as, to quote Boxoffice Magazine’s Kristan Ginther, “forgettable.” For a surprising number of other writers, though, The Object of My Affection was simply too charming to resist. As the Boston Phoenix’s Peter Keough begrudgingly wrote, “When confronted with a film as relentlessly PC and romantically feel-good as The Object of My Affection, you eventually have to succumb.”Dream for an Insomniac (1996)  50%One of Aniston’s earliest screen roles came courtesy of this small production, written and directed by Tiffanie DeBartolo. DeBartolo’s father was once an owner of the San Francisco 49ers, so it’s probably unsurprising that Dream for an Insomniac takes place in the City by the Bay — and given that this was the heyday of the chatty indie flick featuring quirky, gorgeous twentysomethings, it also shouldn’t surprise you that, in the derisive estimation of New York Times critic Stephen Holden, Dream “suggests a pale shadow of Armistead Maupin’s Tales From the City.” It never saw wide release, and never really developed much of an audience on DVD, but for critics like TV Guide’s Maitland McDonagh, it represented “A slight, sleekly polished debut feature propelled by a kinder, gentler Swingers vibe” — and besides, it offers film fans a glimpse of Ione Skye and Mackenzie Astin moving into Parker Posey and Craig Sheffer territory.Rock Star (2001)  53%To her credit, Aniston has played few of the ever-plentiful “supportive girlfriend” roles over the course of her career — but when you’re faced with the opportunity to grab second billing in a movie where Mark Wahlberg plays a working-class stiff who hits the big time, it’s hard to say no. Regrettably, 2001’s Rock Star wasn’t a Boogie Nights-sized hit, either with critics or the aging heshers who might have appreciated the way its storyline mirrors Judas Priest’s trendsetting decision to pluck its new lead singer from the ranks of a tribute band; still, plenty of writers raised their lighters to this inspirational drama, which returned Wahlberg to the arenas he hadn’t occupied since his days fronting the Funky Bunch — and gave formerly chart-topping hair metallurgists like Jason Bonham and Steelheart’s Miljenko Matijevic something to do in the bargain. Zertinet’s Steve Snyder was one of Rock Star‘s most ardent supporters, writing, “Just as it should be falling apart, its melodrama becomes more touching than ever, ultimately shaping a film about much more than any band and more poetic than any song on the radio.”Marley &amp; Me (2008)  62%Cute dogs and small children in the cast tend to be pretty solid indicators of a movie’s willingness to pander, and 2008’s Marley &amp; Me has both — right down to a cuddly, bow-wearing puppy on the poster. But instead of ladling cheap sentiment on audiences, this adaptation of John Grogan’s memoir showed a surprising level of restraint and sensitivity, winning praise from critics and tugging filmgoers’ heartstrings all the way to a nearly $250 million gross (and a Teen Choice Award for Bromantic Comedy!). Though they were regularly upstaged by the titular yellow lab, Aniston and co-star Owen Wilson held their own, thanks to a script that allowed them to show a married couple growing together and making important transitions over time. As William Goss of Cinematical put it, “I’m fairly sure that the book and the film shared a common goal — to make its audience sit, stay, laugh, cry, then move on — and at those modest aspirations, the movie succeeds.”She's the One (1996)  61%In 1996, Edward Burns was coming off The Brothers McMullen, Jennifer Aniston was riding Friends madness to a film career, and Cameron Diaz was, well, Cameron Diaz — taking those three and putting them in a movie with a Tom Petty soundtrack should have been a recipe for instant success. Alas, She’s the One went down as one of the more resounding commercial flops of the season, despite generally positive reviews and a likable cast that also included go-to crusty dad John Mahoney. As critics noted, One‘s storyline, which focused on the romantic dithering (and fraternal squabbling) of two New York brothers, bore more than a passing resemblance to McMullen, and although there are worse things than being compared with a Sundance winner, it wasn’t quite the coming out party Burns must have been hoping for. Still, the experience provided Aniston with her first film role since 1993’s Leprechaun, and the drama moved scribes like Aisle Seat’s Mike McGranaghan, who called it “A brilliant — and much misunderstood — romantic comedy.”Friends With Money (2006)  72%A fair amount of the promotion for Friends with Money involved pictures of Aniston in the French maid outfit her character wears, but titillating stills aside, this feature from Lovely and Amazing writer/director Nicole Holofcener offered viewers an uncommonly smart and surprisingly deep take on female friendships and the way money can affect our relationships with one another. Not blockbuster material, obviously, but with a cast that included Aniston, Catherine Keener, Frances McDormand, and Joan Cusack, as well as a typically sharp Holofcener script, Money was a low-key winner with most critics, including Karina Montgomery of Cinerina, who wrote, “If you are a woman, or if you love one, you should see it. You will see yourself somewhere, as with all her movies, and it will change the way you see yourself as well… Holofcener understands us better than we admit we understand ourselves.”Office Space (1999)  80%All six Friends stars tried their hands at film careers in the ’90s, and while none of them were lucky enough to find features that eclipsed their television work, Aniston surfaced in theaters most regularly — at least in part because she seemed less concerned with finding star vehicles than simply signing on for the best possible scripts. Case in point: Her supporting turn in Office Space, the Mike Judge cult classic that crashed and burned in theaters in 1999, only to rise from the ashes on DVD. Aniston’s scenes as a put-upon waitress in a thinly disguised version of T.G.I.Friday’s may have served chiefly to give Ron Livingston something to do when he wasn’t plotting to destroy his corporate overlords, but they underscored Judge’s hilarious contempt for the vagaries of workplace culture, and reminded us that Aniston’s comic timing was just as sharp on the big screen. Wrote Jeff Vice of the Deseret News, “Anyone who thinks moviegoing can’t be a cathartic experience should see Office Space.”The Good Girl (2002)  82%After paying her dues in a series of relatively thankless rom-coms and minor roles, Aniston earned her first chance to carry a movie with The Good Girl, a quiet, sometimes uncomfortably downcast drama from director Miguel Arteta and screenwriter Mike White, the creative team behind Chuck &amp; Buck. As the aptly named Justine Last, a discontented retail clerk in a small Texas town, Aniston tamps down her natural beauty and comic effervescence to reveal dramatic chops that surprised anyone who still thought of her as Rachel from Friends. The plot eventually stumbles into some melodramatic places, and no matter how ordinary they’re made to look, Aniston and Jake Gyllenhaal don’t really look like small-town losers, but The Good Girl had some poignant things to say about the weight of fading dreams — and the value of responsibility. As Josef Braun of Edmonton’s Vue Weekly noted, “Something in this film sticks to you more than you think it will while you’re watching it. And I think that something is the superb, jarringly resonant central performance by Jennifer Aniston.”The Iron Giant (1999)  96%Before he was the guy who brought you The Incredibles and Ratatouille, Brad Bird was the young director behind one of the most sadly undeserved animation flops of the ’90s: The Iron Giant. Adapted from Ted Hughes’ 1968 novel, with additional input from producer Pete Townshend, whose 1989 song cycle The Iron Man was inspired by the book, Bird’s film captivated its undersized audiences with its endearingly retro look and a Tim McCanlies screenplay that beautifully captured the essence of Hughes’ story about the unlikely friendship between a boy and a giant robot in 1950s Maine. As the boy’s mother, Aniston joined a strong (and refreshingly superstar-free) voice cast that included Harry Connick, Jr., Christopher McDonald, John Mahoney, and Vin Diesel (as the Giant, natch). If you’re one of the many who missed out on The Iron Giant when it was released, do yourself a favor and check it out on DVD — it is, in the words of Matinee Magazine’s Chuck Rudolph, “A wonderfully made and emotionally touching film that takes its place next to Dumbo and Pinocchio as one of the three or four greatest animated films ever made.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Anna, movies, It, Plus, thriller, Year, Plus, mutant, Academy, doctor","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Jennifer-Aniston.jpg","slug":"total-recall-jennifer-anistons-best-movies"},{"id":"47508987492955","title":"Total Recall:  Steve Carell’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Steve Carell's Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Date Night star.by Jeff Giles | April 8, 2010 |  CommentsThe next time you feel like your career isn’t going as smoothly as you’d like, or worry that your dreams may never come true, just remind yourself that, for quite awhile, the biggest credit on Steve Carell‘s résumé was a bit role in Curly Sue. Almost 20 years later, Carell’s perseverance (and tons of talent) have paid off, making him a star of not only some of the last decade’s top-grossing comedies, but one of TV’s most critically beloved sitcoms. This week, Carell teams up with fellow rising comedy star — and NBC alum — Tina Fey for Date Night, and we decided to honor the occasion by taking a look at the critical highlights of his career so far. It’s Total Recall time![tomatometer]MuzeID=1166813[/tomatometer]10. Evan AlmightyAfter the enormous success of The 40-Year-Old Virgin made Carell a bankable leading man, Universal made the Bruce Almighty sequel a priority — a major priority, in fact, to the tune of a record-breaking $200 million budget. This put Evan Almighty in a bit of a pinch when it came time to recoup, and the largely negative reviews didn’t help; ultimately, despite a heavy marketing push from the studio and a storyline that included a bearded Carell building an ark, Evan was one of the year’s bigger disappointments. Still, it wasn’t all bad — David N. Butterworth was one of the critics who enjoyed the sequel, pronouncing it “Better than Bruce by at least two turtle doves and a 40-year-old virgin.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1122616[/tomatometer]9. Bruce AlmightyCarell’s gift for unctuous smarm was already known to fans of The Daily Show, but few of them could have suspected he was capable of walking off with the funniest scenes in a Jim Carrey movie. That’s just what he did with Bruce Almighty, livening up the $484 million hit with his portrayal of Evan Baxter, the newsroom rival of Carrey’s temporarily omnipotent Bruce. “Yep, this is the Carrey America loves,” wrote Tom Long of the Detroit News. “Off-the-wall, over-the-top, elastic, spastic and fantastic.” And when Carrey declined to revisit the character, it was Carell the producers turned to for the sequel.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1183950[/tomatometer]8. Get SmartIf anyone was going to step into Don Adams’ shoe phones for a 21st century version of Get Smart, it had to be Steve Carell. Answering the question of what it would be like if The Office‘s Michael Scott bought a gun and became a bumbling action hero, Peter Segal’s update on the 1960s TV series paired Carell with Anne Hathaway for a round of globetrotting comic espionage that included the talents of Alan Arkin, David Koechner, Bill Murray, and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. While the 2008 edition of Get Smart might not have been a classic, it delivered what it was supposed to: Comedy, action, and a setup for a sequel. As Tom Maurstad of the Dallas Morning News put it, “Instead of the show’s wacky, slapstick tone, Get Smart presents itself as an action-filled spy movie that just happens to be really funny. And for the most part, it succeeds.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1143243[/tomatometer]7. Melinda and MelindaIs life a comedy or a tragedy? That’s the question asked by Woody Allen’s Melinda and Melinda, which finds a pair of playwrights (Wallace Shawn and Larry Pine) using the character of Melinda (Radha Mitchell) to tell a comic (Shawn) or tragic (Pine) tale. Carell reunited with his Anchorman co-star Will Ferrell here — both of them on the comedy side, naturally — and although Melinda and Melinda didn’t earn Anchorman-sized grosses, many critics felt it was one of Allen’s better late-period efforts, including Ian Freer of Empire Magazine, who wrote, “It has great performances, snappy one-liners and a likeably tricksy structure, all wrapped up in an affirmative antidote to life’s daunting complexities. Welcome back, Woody.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1185179[/tomatometer]6. Dan in Real LifeThough frequently called upon to play overbearing buffoons, Carell is equally adept with more complex characters — like Dan Burns, the widowed parent whose emotional rebirth forms the heart of Dan in Real Life. Dotted with the sort of painfully awkward situations Carell’s so good in, Dan also highlighted his dramatic gifts by giving him a character with difficult, and easily identifiable, challenges. The reviews suffered from critical exhaustion with indie dramedies about quirky families, but most writers were able to see past the surface similarities to other releases and recognize a warm-hearted film that managed to walk the line between sweet and saccharine — not to mention a fine performance from its star. As Time’s Richard Schickel put it in his review, “Now, everybody knows that Steve Carell is lovable.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1133967[/tomatometer]5. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron BurgundyIn a movie full of eminently quotable one-liners, it’s saying something that Steve Carell’s character, Brick Tamland, probably uttered the most quotable of all — including the immortal “I love lamp” and “I think I ate your chocolate squirrel.” Whether spouting non sequitirs or bringing a hand grenade and a trident to a reporters’ brawl, Brick was the glassy-eyed doofus who underscored Anchorman‘s salty profanity with naïve, brain-damaged sweetness — and helped send the movie hurtling down the IQ ladder with such infectious glee that most critics couldn’t stop laughing long enough to voice their disapproval. Applauded Robert Wilonsky of the Dallas Observer, “At its best it plays like modern-day Marx Brothers, in which every single thing that happens makes no sense and serves no purpose and nothing happens for any reason at all.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1156557[/tomatometer]4. Over the HedgeCarell made his first venture into animation voicework with DreamWorks Animation’s adaptation of the Over the Hedge comic strip, joining a colorful cast that included Bruce Willis, Garry Shandling, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, and Nick Nolte. Hedge‘s menagerie of talking animals — including Carell, who voiced Hammy, a sugar-addicted squirrel with what appears to be the rodent strain of attention deficit disorder — struck some scribes as suspiciously similar to the critters DreamWorks unleashed for 2005’s Madagascar, but its sharp script and charismatic cast helped Hedge overcome most writers’ fears of a furry glut. Calling it a “brightly animated, frequently hilarious and perfectly cast comedy from the Dreamworks stable,” ViewLondon’s Matthew Turner praised Over the Hedge as “the best of the recent animal-themed cartoon features.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1184824[/tomatometer]3. Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who!After the brightly colored critical misfire that was How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Jim Carrey and Dr. Seuss may have seemed like a pairing to avoid, but all that changed with the 2008 release of Fox’s Horton Hears a Who!, which paired Carrey (as the soft-hearted elephant Horton) with Carell (as the beleaguered mayor of the tiny burg of Whoville) and came up with 86 minutes of CGI animation that families and critics could all enjoy. Supported by an impressive cast that included Carol Burnett, Seth Rogen, Isla Fisher, Jonah Hill, and Will Arnett, Horton expanded Seuss’ classic tale to feature length without sacrificing the gentle whimsy that has made the book such a perennial favorite, and enjoyed some of the year’s best box office as a reward. Observed Brian Webster of the Apollo Guide, “Taking on Seuss has proven a challenge for Hollywood, but a nice balance has been struck here between authenticity and new ideas. This one’s a winner.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1149494[/tomatometer]2. The 40-Year-Old VirginR-rated comedies were an endangered species during the early aughts — and then along came Judd Apatow to reinvigorate the genre by proving that people would still turn out in droves to see them, provided the comedy included brains and heart along with the T&amp;A. Case in point: The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Apatow and Steve Carell co-wrote the script, which gave Carell his long worked-for starmaking role: the good-hearted Andy Stitzer, whose quest to end his virginity sets up two hours of raunchy gags, Michael McDonald bashing, and inspired lunacy from Jane Lynch. $177 million in worldwide grosses later, Apatow and Carell were household names — and “Kelly Clarkson!” was an acceptable epithet — thanks in part to critical praise from writers like Paul Greenwood of Future Movies, who wrote, “It’s a joy to be in the hands of filmmakers who intuitively know the difference between rude and crude, who know that horny and heartfelt can exist in tandem and that jokes about race and sexuality are not the same as racism and homophobia.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1158201[/tomatometer]1. Little Miss SunshineThe movie business has always had its soulless, by-the-numbers side — that’s the “business” part — but it also has the unique capacity to deliver inspiring success stories like Little Miss Sunshine, which turned a first screenplay (written by Michael Arndt) and directorial debut (by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris) into a Sundance smash and, eventually, a $100 million hit. It was also a critical favorite, despite offering another indie-brewed family of eccentrics (and being yet another road trip movie in the bargain). This was thanks in part to the stellar cast, which included Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Abigail Breslin, a thunderously funny Alan Arkin, and Carell in an unusually dark turn as Frank Ginsberg, a gay professor whose obsession with a grad student led to a recent suicide attempt. “If you think you’ve seen it all before in a family road movie,” challenged Peter Howell of the Toronto Star, “you owe it to yourself to see what happens when somebody actually comes up with a few bright ideas.”In case you were wondering, here are Carell’s top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. Little Miss Sunshine — 93%2. The 40-Year-Old Virgin — 90%3. Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who! — 86%4. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy — 84%5. Over the Hedge — 81%6. Get Smart — 79%7.

But that isn’t all Vaughn can do, as he’s proven while assembling an admirably eclectic filmography, moving from comedy to horror to action thrillers and back again, and sharing screens with everyone from Richard Attenborough to Jennifer Lopez in the process. This weekend, Vaughn reunites with his old partner Jon Favreau in Couples Retreat, and to celebrate, we decided to revisit his best-reviewed films, Total Recall style!As always, we let the Tomatometer do the sorting for us, and although it did the easy work, tossing out the obvious rotten flicks (bye bye, The Break-Up), we still had to make a few judgment calls on roles that, though memorable, still amounted to cameos (adieu, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith, Into the Wild, and Anchorman). What we were finally left with was a list that we think captures the breadth of Vaughn’s filmography while limiting it to the movies that gave him a healthy amount of screentime. And with that, let’s dispense with the formalities and get down to the films, shall we? Ladies and gents, the best of Vince Vaughn![tomatometer]MuzeID=1099454[/tomatometer]10. The CellVaughn received second billing to Jennifer Lopez in Tarsem Singh’s directorial debut, but both of them (along with Vincent D’Onofrio) took a back seat to the incredible special effects in 2000’s The Cell — not to mention the stupendously grisly violence that alternately made critics think (Nick Davis called it “amazing, courageous, and thoroughly dark”) and run screaming for the aisles (ViewLondon’s Matthew Turner pronounced it “bad in so many ways that it’s difficult to know where to begin”). Ultimately, this tale of a child psychologist who has to enter the mind of a depraved serial killer to save the life of his latest victim wasn’t one of the year’s biggest critical winners, but it broke $100 million at the box office — and it gave Vaughn a chance to flex some dramatic muscle in an effects-heavy thriller completely devoid of dinosaurs.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1077068[/tomatometer]9. The Lost World: Jurassic ParkVaughn’s first major role came in Swingers, a film with a budget of $250,000. His next movie was a bit of a step up: 1997’s The Lost World: Jurassic Park boasted a $73 million bankroll, not to mention Steven Spielberg in the director’s chair and a cast including such famous names as Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, and Lord Richard Attenborough. Of course, Lost World wasn’t greeted with quite the same critical reception enjoyed by Swingers, but on the other hand, it did make over $600 million at the box office — and it featured dozens of awesome-looking CGI dinosaurs, which makes up for any critical brickbats, or the fact that Vaughn’s character is a knuckleheaded environmentalist who’s more concerned about saving giant carnivores than his own traveling companions. Looking Closer’s Jeffrey Overstreet summed it all up succinctly when he wrote, “If you liked Jurassic Park, you’ll probably like this one a little less. What the first film did poorly, this film does worse.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1085591[/tomatometer]8. A Cool, Dry PlaceBased on Michael Grant Jaffe’s novel Dance Real Slow, 1998’s A Cool, Dry Place broke Vaughn’s string of rapscallions and ne’er-do-wells and gave him the first thoroughly sympathetic role of his career: Russell Durrell, a young lawyer struggling through single fatherhood after his wife (Monica Potter) abandons him and their five-year-old son (Bobby Moat). Despite a cast that also included Joey Lauren Adams, Place barely squeaked its way into theaters, grossing a few thousand dollars during a one-week run — and though many critics rolled their eyes at the film’s leisurely pace and heavy melodrama (Filmcritic’s Christopher Null accused the plot of “just [sitting] there like a stuffed monkey”), they were matched by scribes such as Sandra Contreras of TV Guide, who wrote, “Its heart is in the right place, but this sweet drama just doesn’t build enough true drama from its slender premise. That said, it’s not bad enough to merit the kind of stealth release its studio has imposed on it.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1120655[/tomatometer]7. Old SchoolAfter 2000’s The Cell, Vaughn was relatively quiet for a few years; although he appeared in a pair of major releases (Domestic Disturbance and Made, both released in 2001), he spent much of his time in films whose appeal was more, uh, selective (The Prime Gig, I Love Your Work). It took another testosterone-heavy ensemble comedy to remind audiences what made the Swingers star famous — and okay, so Old School ended up being stolen by Will Ferrell, but Vaughn got his share of laughs, too, and it foreshadowed his funny bit parts in Anchorman and Starsky and Hutch. A not inconsiderable number of critics dismissed Old School‘s raunchy lowbrow humor, but the majority agreed with Cinerina’s Karina Montgomery, who gasped, “I can’t believe it, but I want to see it again.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1083944[/tomatometer]6. Clay PigeonsAfter making a splash with Swingers, Vaughn hit the ground running, booking roles in several years’ worth of big-budget productions, including 1997’s Jurassic Park sequel, The Lost World, and the costly Jennifer Lopez flop The Cell. Between the tentpoles, however, Vaughn hadn’t lost his taste for the odd lower-profile project — like Clay Pigeons, a Ridley Scott-produced black comedy about a drifter (Vaughn) who uses his imagined friendship with a casual acquaintance (Joaquin Phoenix) as the impetus for a homicidal, Throw Momma from the Train-style “favor.” Playing a charming, murderous lunatic helped prep Vaughn for the starring role in Gus Van Sant’s Psycho remake — and while Pigeons didn’t make much of an impression at the box office, it earned the admiration of critics like the Palo Alto Weekly’s Jeanne Aufmuth, who wrote, “This is not your classic whodunit. It’s blacker,funnier, and edgier.”Warning: NSFW — language.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1133496[/tomatometer]5. Dodgeball: A True Underdog StoryVaughn has an admirably varied resume, having done everything from thrillers to dramas to comedies, but if forced to choose, most people would probably say he works most successfully as half of a comic duo. It stands to reason, then, that 2004’s Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story — which pits Vaughn against a hilariously over-the-top Ben Stiller in a fight to the finish to be decided by bouncy rubber balls traveling at punishingly high speeds. The idea of a movie about grown men playing professional dodge ball is funny all by itself, and when you have the added benefit of a cast stuffed with funny supporting players (including Jason Bateman, Gary Cole, Stephen Root, and Rip Torn), you’re almost assured of a movie that’ll make at least two-thirds of its audience laugh — and, as it turns out, 70 percent of the world’s top critics. Of course, there were a few curmudgeons turned off by Dodgeball‘s broad humor, but most reviews echoed the sentiments of Rolling Stone’s Peter Travers, who wrote, “This masterpiece of modern cinema depends upon a single truism: A guy getting hit in the nuts a hundred times in a row is funny a hundred times.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1083688[/tomatometer]4. Return to ParadiseThis Joseph Ruben-directed remake of the 1989 French movie Force majeure arrived during a period when American filmmakers were apparently pretty fascinated with the travails of reckless U.S. tourists in Southeast Asian prisons — Brokedown Palace was released a year later, and both films suffered comparisons with Alan Parker’s Midnight Express. Starring Vaughn, Joaquin Phoenix, and David Conrad as a trio of pot-puffing Malaysian tourists who inadvertently run afoul of the law, Paradise took a familiar plot device — innocent American awaiting death in a foreign prison — and added a new wrinkle: Vaughn and Conrad, safe on U.S. soil, are told they can save Phoenix from being hanged, but only if they return to Malaysia to do hard time. Though the script wasn’t without its fair share of contrivances, Paradise‘s thorny moral dilemma was enough to satisfy most critics, and even those who didn’t give the movie their stamp of approval tended to find positive aspects — like Luisa F. Ribeiro of Boxoffice Magazine, who wrote, “Vaughn labors mightily under the obviousness of the script, while managing to reveal a fragile but profound fear of being an aging frat boy who longs to realize a finer, better self, only to be petrified that quality isn’t within him.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1108720[/tomatometer]3. MadeFive years after they gave each other their big break in Swingers, Vaughn and Jon Favreau reunited — this time, with Favreau behind the camera in addition to writing the script — for the mob comedy Made. Starring Vaughn and Favreau as a pair of low-level Mafia knuckleheads, Made took their funny, fast-paced banter, surrounded it with a bigger budget, and added drugs, violence, and Sean “Diddy” Combs. Predictably, critics couldn’t help but compare Made to its surprise hit predecessor — and just as predictably, these comparisons didn’t do Made any favors. Still, even if Made didn’t reach Swingers‘ lofty critical heights (and barely made back its budget), Vaughn and Favreau’s chemistry remained potent enough to impress critics like Hollywood.com’s Stacie Hougland, who wrote, “Vaughn hits the bullseye as a strident, volatile jerk who can’t keep his mouth shut. You never really like him, but you can’t wait to see what he’ll do next — his missteps and offenses are so unbelievable you wince, but you can’t look away.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1146685[/tomatometer]2. Wedding CrashersPart of the recent R-rated comedy renaissance, Wedding Crashers may not have given Vaughn the opportunity to do anything new — here, he appears as Jeremy Grey, a lech with a heart of gold who isn’t terribly dissimilar from the character he played in Swingers — but it fell squarely in Vaughn’s comedic wheelhouse, had a solid Steve Faber/Bob Fisher script, and surrounded Vaughn and his co-star, Owen Wilson, with some terrific supporting talent, including Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams, and Isla Fisher as the crazy nymphomaniac who thrills and torments Vaughn in equal measure. Though some critics had problems with Crashers‘ uneven tone — and the scads of gratuitous flesh on display in the movie’s opening montage — most found it too much fun to resist. “The likes of the sneakily subversive Wilson and Vaughn deserve better,” wrote MaryAnn Johnson of Flick Filosopher, “but this is darn close to a perfect showcase for what they can do, and how much better they do it together.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1074308[/tomatometer]1. SwingersSomehow, we doubt many of you are surprised that this list ends where it all began for Vince Vaughn — specifically, with his scene-stealing turn as the appealingly smarmy Trent Walker, best bud to Jon Favreau’s sad sack Mike Peters. Favreau may have written the script, but it was Vaughn who ended up with many of Swingers‘ best lines — and although it’s true that those lines inspired countless wannabe hipsters to pronounce various persons and objects as “so money” for years to come, that’s just an unfortunate byproduct of the movie’s immense likability, and Vaughn’s seemingly effortless cool in the role, which showcased his gifts for comedy and drama. “Four guys hang out, kid one another, get into scuffles and flash their gonadal searchlight for available women,” wrote Time’s Richard Corliss. “Yikes, haven’t there been enough variations on the multiple-buddy movie? Actually, no.”Take a look through Vaughn’s complete filmography, as well as the rest of our Total Recall archives.

However,expertly-staged gunplay is one of the reasons we love going to the movies —there’s nothing like the catharsis of cinematic shootouts. Thus, we’ve compileda list of our favorite movie gunfights — scenes that left our ears ringing andour pulses quickened. However, these are just our faves (spoilers, language, and some mild violence abound obviously!) — this list is by nomeans definitive. RT users, chime in — what are your favorites?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1077152[/tomatometer]The Fifth ElementIt’s probably in Bruce Willis’s contract that if he gets cast as thereluctant hero, he’s obligated to kick serious ass at least oncethroughout the proceedings. Luc Besson’s The Fifth Element is such astrange cocktail of sci-fi, slapstick, and dramatic intrigue that it’shard to predict just what form said Willis asskickery would take. So itoccurs in the second-half and is so worth the wait: rubbery monstersstorm an opera house, the singer gets assassinated, and Willis, withouta gun at first, is in charge of saving a flamboyant Chris Tucker and amob of libertines. It’s an exhilarating firefight, replete with Besson’skinetic camerawork juxtaposed with Willis’s steely no-nonsense.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1048053[/tomatometer]TombstonePerhaps no style of film has romanticized gunfights more than theWestern — and the somewhat cartoonish, largely consequence-free natureof classic Western violence made the genre ripe for revisionist (andmore emotionally resonant) fare such as 1993’s Tombstone, whichdepicts the unfortunately eventful “retirement” of legendary Wild Westlawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), whose feud with a band of outlaws ledby “Curly Bill” Brocious (Powers Boothe) illustrates the sad echo ofviolence — even of the righteous variety — and the horrible toll ittakes on a man’s soul. This scene, which recreates the oft-fetishizedBattle at the O.K. Corral, serves up a generous helping of satisfyingHollywood shootout action, while making clear the black regret andterrible destruction that lies in its real-life wake.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1002887[/tomatometer]Bonnie and ClydeNot every memorable gunfight is a battle among equals. Like theBattle of Little Bighorn, the Tyson-Spinks fight, and Super Bowl XX, theclimactic shootout in Bonnie and Clyde is famous for beingabsurdly one-sided. Bank-robbing sweethearts Bonnie Parker (FayeDunaway) and Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) certainly knew how to handlefirearms, but caught flat-footed by heavily armed g-men while helping afriend-turned snitch change a tire, they didn’t stand a chance. One ofthe key works in the “New Hollywood” era of the late 1960s and early1970s, Bonnie and Clyde ushered in a period of more intenseonscreen violence — and made its protagonists countercultural martyrs.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1118792[/tomatometer]Equilibrium“Gun Kata” might sound like something a group of especiallyprecocious second graders might make up for a playground fight duringrecess, but in the world of Kurt Wimmer’s (admittedly rather Matrix-esque)2002 dystopian sci-fi action epic Equilibrium, it’s the name ofa fun-to-watch martial art that allows its masters to determine wheretheir opponents will stand, stab, or shoot at any given moment. One suchmaster is John Preston (Christian Bale), who rebels against theemotion-outlawing government of Libria by colluding with an undergroundresistance to help assassinate the shadowy leader known as Father.Preston is found out — and Father is, of course, not who he seems —but not even a building full of machine gun-wielding guards can preventPreston from kata-ing his way straight to Father’s inner sanctum,delivering a slew of eye-popping deaths as he goes…and saving the bestfor last.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1018324[/tomatometer]ScarfaceIn a roundabout way, Tony Montana embodies the perseverance of thehuman spirit. With a veritable army invading his house, he doesn’t stopshooting (or swearing, for that matter), unloading round after roundfrom his machine gun despite facing the prospect of certain death.Forget chewing the scenery — as the iconic drug lord, Al Pacino gobblesit up, spits it out, and goes back for seconds. Not that that’s a badthing; if a scene requires an actor to shout “Say hello to my leetlefriend!” while discharging a grenade launcher, it’s preferable to havesomeone who can deliver such a line with panache. Tony’s downfall mighthave been inevitable, but if you’re gonna go down, it’s best to go downswinging.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1004567[/tomatometer]CommandoFuture California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger plows through anarmy that’s only slightly smaller than the population of the GoldenState in Commando. As John Matrix (Best. Name. Ever),Ah-nold is on the trail of Bennett, a former member of his elitecommando unit, who’s made the suicidal mistake of kidnapping Matrix’sdaughter. Matrix is remarkably calm while he’s mowing down Bennett’shenchmen; later, he provides some priceless stress-management advice tohis nemesis: “Let off some steam, Bennett.” (The mansion where theclimactic shootout takes place is probably in need of repairs — it’s thesame place where Axel Foley took down Victor Maitland in BeverlyHills Cop.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1174201[/tomatometer]Shoot ‘Em UpAmerican audiences have become so inured to the sights and sounds ofgunfights in the movies that sometimes, the only thing to do is give into the mind-numbing goofiness of it all and let loose with 86 minutes ofrock ’em, sock ’em barrels-blazin’ action — like, for instance, 2007’sShoot ‘Em Up, in which the mysterious, seemingly indestructibleMr. Smith (Clive Owen) has an ammo-loaded custody battle over a baby whois the unlikely target of a gang of thugs led by the madly sputteringHertz (Paul Giamatti). As per its title, the movie is stacked withshootouts, but our favorite is this warehouse slaughter, which findsSmith sending Hertz’s goons to their doom via a series of artfullyarranged, string-triggered guns that would have made Jim Henson proud.(Actually, probably not, but they’re still pretty awesome.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1008619[/tomatometer]The Good, The Bad,and the UglyClint Eastwood has been involved in a lot of memorable shootouts overthe years, from Dirty Harry to last year’s Grand Torino.But nothing can top the final scene in The Good, the Bad, and theUgly, in which the Man With No Name (Eastwood) stares down hisarch-nemesis Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef) and his occasional ally Tuco (EliWallach). The Mexican standoff scene has been imitated in countlessfilms, but no one’s come close to duplicating it; Sergio Leone’s extremeclose-ups and Ennio Morricone’s thrillingly bombastic scoring make for ascene that makes up in tension what it lacks in pure firepower.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1174279[/tomatometer]WantedEvery time we think we’ve seen the absolute ultimate in highlystylized, adrenaline-goosing cinematic action, technology — and adirector with an eye for unforgettable set pieces — comes long to proveus wrong. Such was the case with 2008’s Wanted, which founddirector Timur Bekmambetov turning the Mark Millar comic into a sleek,giddy celebration of ridiculously over the top film violence. Wantedoverflows with gunplay, but for our money, the movie’s sweetest ride isthis opening shootout/high-speed chase, which pits the Fox (AngelinaJolie) against an assassin named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) in a battleinvolving loads of high-tech weaponry, some remarkable acrobatic feats,one sweet sports car, and, yes, curving bullets. Where’s that sequel?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1068182[/tomatometer]HeatOften, movie gunplay is used as a method of releasing tension in astory, giving audiences a visceral thrill while pausing the seriousbusiness of exposition and setting characters more or less free on thecanvas. In other cases, however, gunfights are actually used to increasetension — and this interminable, nail-biting standoff between an LAPDsquad led by Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and the crew of masterthief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), from Michael Mann’s 1995 actionclassic Heat, is a perfect example, mainly because it all feelsso real — a messy blend of screamingchaos and spooky, unnatural silence depicted in this scene.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1059489[/tomatometer]The Wild BunchPike Bishop (William Holden) sums up director Sam Peckinpah’s modusoperandi for The Wild Bunch thusly: “If they move, kill ’em.”Peckinpah was a master of exhilarating, fatalistic onscreen violence,and The Wild Bunch is probably his greatest work — as well ashis most controversial (because of the level of violence, the MPAAthreatened the film with an X rating). The Bunch is a gang of outlawswho know their way of life is closing in on them — and don’t take wellto being betrayed by a corrupt warlord. The Bunch’s last stand is one ofthe bloodiest scenes in movie history, and the film exerted a powerfulinfluence on everyone from John Woo to Quentin Tarantino.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1032434[/tomatometer]The KillerFew directors can match John Woo when it comes to staging balleticonscreen violence. Woo’s oeuvre contains so many outrageously kineticset pieces that it’s difficult to choose just one. If pressed, we’d haveto go with the climactic shootout in The Killer, which is kindof like the video for Prince’s “When Doves Cry” crossed with the finaleof Scarface. Woo’s Hong Kong films may be insanely bloody, butwhat makes them resonate beyond their explosive energy are his deeplymoral characters; in The Killer, a hit man (Chow Yun-Fat) and acop (Danny Lee Sau-Yin) team up to protect a blind woman (Sally Yeh)from the Triads. The extreme loyalty that binds this unlikely trio (andthe fact that they make their last stand in a church) lends heft to oneof the bloodiest shootouts in movie history.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1164807[/tomatometer]Hot FuzzDirector Edgar Wright and actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost haveestablished themselves as the go-to guys for sharp, satirical commentaryon movies and pop culture with their imaginative BBC series Spacedand their sendup of zombie movies, Shaun of the Dead. And witha resume like that, they had high expectations to meet with their takeon buddy-cop action flicks, Hot Fuzz. Boy did they deliver!Utilizing the same tongue-in-cheek humor and a conspiracy theory-themedscript, Hot Fuzz turns Pegg and Frost into the unlikeliestaction heroes since (Good) Will Hunting brought down the CIA and becamePeople Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive. In the film’s climactic battle,Pegg and Frost grab as many guns as they can carry and waltz through themiddle of their village-turned-cult headquarters, unloading buckets oflead on everyone from the pub owners to the town priest and making for akinetic shootout sequence that would have done Michael Bay proud. It’s adifficult task to walk the line between brutal and hilarious, but HotFuzz manages to do it with incredible panache – there are fewscenes in cinema capable of amping your adrenaline levels and making youlaugh all at once quite the same way this one does.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1202802[/tomatometer]The InternationalThe International‘s premise – namely that banks aresurreptitiously involved in acts of terrorism – is decidedly farfetched,but it worked well enough to provide fodder for an action-packed,globe-trotting conspiracy thriller. In fact, even if the story did leaveyou scracthing your head a bit, one might argue that the film’s exoticlocales and explosive action at least merit a viewing. Architecturefigures heavily into the plot, and in one sequence in particular, theGuggenheim Museum in New York plays host to one of the most interestingand exciting gunfights in recent memory. Of course, they couldn’t reallyallow Clive Owen and his pals blast the place to bits, so director TomTykwer built a life-sized replica of the museum’s interior for theoccasion, complete with spiraling walkway. And thank goodness he did –instead of a muted assassination sequence, we get 10 minutes of puredestructive carnage that remind us fine art is a small price to pay fora bit of fun with firearms.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1086960[/tomatometer]The MatrixLike an enigma wrapped in a riddle wrapped in a mystery, nestledwithin The Matrix’s mind-altering concept and moody atmosphere is quitepossibly modern cinema’s greatest gunfight. The movie holds many rewardsfor the philosophical cineaste, but for those who are content with justkung-fu and gunplay, the Wachowski present you…the lobby scene. Neoand Trinity (Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, respectively) enter abuilding filled with bad guys, their trench coats lined with all mannerof firearms, and proceed to decimate everyone and everything on sitewith bullets, judo chops, somersaults, and judicious use of awesome slo-mo.Some movies try too hard to be cool; this one justifies all itsposturing and preening, and then some.Trigger finger still itchy?

Travolta buddies up with Robin Williams in this weekend’s Old Dogs, which inspired us to take a look back at a filmography far more varied than you might remember. Dramas? Comedies? Thrillers? Cartoons? Heck, Travolta’s done ’em all — and he’s been doing it for more than 30 years, too. It’s high time he got the Total Recall treatment, wouldn’t you say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1082863[/tomatometer]10. Primary ColorsBased on a thinly fictionalized account of the 1992 presidential campaign written by Joe Klein (who hid, for a time, behind the nom de plume “Anonymous”), and featuring cameos by Geraldo Rivera, Charlie Rose, Larry King, and Bill Maher as themselves, 1998’s Primary Colors could easily have been overshadowed by the real-life circus that followed Bill Clinton’s administration during both of his terms — but director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Elaine May had been a creative team for decades, and their comfort with one another, as well as a terrific cast, made Colors one of the better-reviewed films of the year. Travolta, tasked with providing a caricature of a sitting President that was still layered enough to carry an entire movie, passed with flying colors; as John R. McEwen of Film Quips write, “John Travolta continues to establish himself as one of the best actors of the younger generation, and this may be his best job yet.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1008729[/tomatometer]9. GreaseYou might be shocked to find Grease so far down on the list, but you probably shouldn’t be — Randal Kleiser’s 1978 adaptation of the Jacobs and Casey musical was always more of an audience phenomenon than a critical darling, and although an 84 percent Tomatometer rating is nothing to sniff at, Grease is, in the words of the Apollo Guide’s Scott Weinberg, “a critic-proof movie.” Even Grease‘s most fervent fans can’t help but recognize the inherent silliness of actors in their 20s singing and dancing their way through high school, but what drew people to the movie then — and what even the stuffiest critics were forced to recognize — is the effortless charisma of the movie’s stars, as well as the instantly catchy songs that made the stage version such a hit. Just one year removed from Saturday Night Fever, Travolta continued his hot streak with a performance that ReelViews’ James Berardinelli described as “a riot,” going on to say, “Alternately swaggering to prove his “coolness” and re-affirming his ability on the dance floor, the actor gives the kind of performance that’s perfect for the role.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1068174[/tomatometer]8. Get ShortyIts ill-advised, 10-years-later sequel may have been titled Be Cool, but it’s really 1995’s Get Shorty that has all kinds of cool, thanks to a Scott Frank script that does a tremendous job of adapting the Elmore Leonard novel that shares its name, assured direction from Barry Sonnenfeld, and a crackerjack cast that included the combined talents of Delroy Lindo, Dennis Farina, Rene Russo, Gene Hackman, and a resurgent, post-Pulp Fiction Travolta as gangster/cineaste Chili Palmer. Freed from the direct-to-video ghetto and clearly enjoying the opportunity to share a great script with a talented cast, Travolta earned the praise of critics like the Washington Post’s Desson Thomson, who wrote, “This comic potboiler about gangsters in Hollywood would be a great piece of fun even without Travolta. But as a loan shark from Miami with a charming bedside manner and bigtime movie dreams, he raises the fun quotient into the sublime.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1191986[/tomatometer]7. BoltTravolta kicked off the 21st century with Battlefield Earth — and things didn’t get much better for most of the decade, with the Travolta filmography enduring a string of high-profile duds like Swordfish and The Punisher. The last couple of years, however, have brought another re-ascendancy for the actor; though his movies haven’t always prospered critically (see: Wild Hogs), they do tend to make money — and a few of them have managed to succeed on both fronts. Case in point: 2008’s Bolt, which gave Travolta the opportunity to pair up with tween queen Miley Cyrus (and briefly rescuscitate his long-dormant recording career with a soundtrack duet) in the tale of a deluded canine star who teams up with a cat and a hamster to save his owner from a fictional evil genius. Bolt may have looked like just another over-caffeinated kid flick, but beneath its bright CGI visuals beat a sweet, old-school Disney heart, reflected in a tender, intelligent Chris Williams/Dan Fogelman script almost entirely devoid of gratuitous pop culture references and scatological humor. The movie’s less aggressive tone was appreciated by critics like Combustible Celluloid’s Jeffrey M. Anderson, who wrote, “John Travolta’s earnest, gentle voice performance as the title character goes a long way in making this Disney animated feature a winner.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1002672[/tomatometer]6. Blow OutThe early-to-mid 1980s were unkind to John Travolta — but before the career-suspending trifecta of Staying Alive, Two of a Kind, and Perfect, Travolta had the opportunity to star in Brian De Palma’s Blow Out. A bleak thriller that successfully juggles a number of heady themes, Blow Out functions as both a darkly paranoid action movie and a savvy commentary on post-Watergate paranoia — not to mention the nature of filmmaking itself. It’s a far cry, in other words, from the blockbuster crowd-pleasers that made Travolta a superstar; perhaps unsurprisingly, it was almost completely abandoned by fans of Tony Manero and Danny Zuko. Which was unfortunate, because the role of Jack Terry, a sound technician who believes he’s accidentally recorded evidence of an assassination, required Travolta to deliver acting unvarnished by white suits, the Bee Gees, or Olivia Newton-John — and he proved more than up to the task. Blow Out eventually found an audience over time, thanks to the home video market, but critics were always on board; in the words of Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine, “Blow Out is not known as one of Brian De Palma’s horror movies, but of all his films, it’s the one that feels most like a nightmare.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1018219[/tomatometer]5. Saturday Night FeverA movie so successful it single-handedly jump-started the white leisure suit industry, the Bee Gees’ chart dominance of the late 1970s, and John Travolta’s acting career, Saturday Night Fever had humble origins (it was inspired by a New York magazine story later discovered to have been fabricated) and a plot that came in second (or third) to its soundtrack. But hey, it was a pretty spectacular soundtrack — and Fever also boasted a hungry, nuanced performance from Travolta, who embodied the desperation of Brooklyn dreamer Tony Manero with so much raw talent that he hardly seemed like the same guy starring as goofball Vinnie Barbarino in Welcome Back, Kotter. Saturday Night Fever was a huge commercial sensation, but it was also a dance movie with a yearning, wounded heart, and Travolta’s star turn was recognized by critics like Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who effused, “Mr. Travolta is deft and vibrant, and he never condescends to the character, not even in a scene that has Tony and Stephanie arguing about whose Romeo and Juliet it is, Zeffirelli’s or Shakespeare’s.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1003625[/tomatometer]4. CarrieBefore Brian De Palma gave John Travolta one of the meatiest roles of his career in Blow Out, he reached out and gave the young actor his first big break as one of Sissy Spacek’s teen tormentors in the big-screen adaptation of Stephen King’s first hit novel. It’s fashionable to dump on King’s work, and you might not expect any movie whose climax hinges on a strategically placed bucket of pig blood to find much purchase with serious film critics, but Carrie is not only one of the earliest high school horror movies, it’s one of the best. Anchored by a typically powerful performance from Sissy Spacek (not to mention Piper Laurie as her psychotic mother), Carrie drew praise from most critics — including Roger Ebert, who called it “an absolutely spellbinding horror movie, with a shock at the end that’s the best thing along those lines since the shark leaped aboard in Jaws.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1174196[/tomatometer]3. HairsprayTaking the musical stage adaptation of a John Waters movie and turning it back into a film doesn’t seem like the most intelligent way to score a hit movie, but when you’re armed with John Travolta in a fat suit — as a woman — anything can happen. In the case of 2007’s Hairspray, “anything” included a $200 million-plus gross, a Golden Globe nomination for Travolta, and critical praise from scribes like Heather Huntington of ReelzChannel.com, who wrote, “I will confess that Travolta totally turned me around. A mountain of a woman in his female fat suit, he commits 150% to the role.” As Edna, the strict, reclusive mother of Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), Travolta not only partially repented for his involvement in Wild Hogs earlier in the year, he made Christopher Walken seem like a believable suburban middle-class dad. Yes, Hairspray has some important things to say about race relations in the early ’60s (and by extension, today) — but even without its trenchant subtext, it succeeds as an eminently likable film. In the words of DVDTown’s John J. Puccio, “How can you not like a movie in which John Travolta and Christopher Walken sing a love song to each other?”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1077674[/tomatometer]2. Face/OffThere’s something to be said for an actor who knows who to deliver a quietly understated performance. There’s also something to be said for chomping down on the scenery and gnawing it until there’s nothing left, which is exactly what Travolta and Nicolas Cage got to do in John Woo’s Face/Off — and they got to pretend to be each other in the bargain, thanks to a delightfully absurd script involving terrorism, face transplants, and doves. Woo’s had a bumpy time in Hollywood, to say the least, but Paramount gave him complete control over Face/Off, and his untrammelled vision shines in an action thriller that manages to be both over-the-top ridiculous and filled to the brim with laughs, brilliant set pieces, and white-knuckle entertainment. Salon’s Stephanie Zacharek summed up the movie’s unlikely charm when she wrote, “Florid, passionate, frequently hilarious and loaded with messy emotions that nobody in his or her right mind should even attempt to explain, it’s operatic in its nutball intensity.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1060462[/tomatometer]1. Pulp FictionA lot of people loved Pulp Fiction in 1994, but it’s hard to imagine that any of them loved it more than John Travolta. Consider, if you will, that the future Vincent Vega was limping his way through Look Who’s Talking Now just the year before Fiction came out — and making a cameo as himself in the alleged comedy Boris and Natasha: The Movie the year before that. It had been a very long time since most people had thought of Travolta as a real actor — but it had been even longer since anyone as talented as Quentin Tarantino had availed themselves of Travolta’s long-slumbering talent. Here, armed with a classic Tarantino script, surrounded by a talented cast, and exhibiting a new level of physical presence, Travolta was one of Pulp Fiction‘s many revelations, and he justifiably used his work here as a launchpad for one of the most unlikely second acts in Hollywood history. “It’s the movie equivalent,” wrote the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick LaSalle, “of that rare sort of novel where you find yourself checking to see how many pages are left and hoping there are more, not fewer.”In case you were wondering, here are Travolta’s top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. Pulp Fiction — 96%2. Bolt — 89%3. Hairspray — 88%4. Carrie — 87%5. Saturday Night Fever — 82%6. Get Shorty — 81%7. Blow Out — 81%8. Grease — 79%9. A Love Song for Bobby Long — 78%10.

Today? She’s one of Hollywood’s fastest rising stars, with a pair of Oscar nominations under her belt and a growing reputation for enlivening even the most pedestrian fare. If you’ve ever seen one of Adams’ movies, the reasons for her speedy ascent should be obvious: With dramatic chops, sharp comic timing, and looks that work equally well for character roles and glamorous leads, she’s a casting director’s dream. And if you haven’t seen any of her films, don’t fret — with her latest, the romantic comedy Leap Year, reaching theaters this weekend, we thought now would be a great time to look back on her filmography, Total Recall style![tomatometer]MuzeID=1197692[/tomatometer]10. Night at the Museum: Battle of the SmithsonianPoor Hilary Swank. She slaved over her labor-of-love Amelia Earhart biopic, Amelia, only to find her carefully considered portrayal of the iconic pilot overshadowed by a decidedly less serious Amelia. At 44 percent on the Tomatometer, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian isn’t anyone’s idea of a critical darling, but it beats Amelia‘s 21 percent — and critics almost unanimously agreed that the best thing about Smithsonian‘s ungainly second helping of magically animated museum exhibits was Amy Adams as the thrillseeking sidekick who helps Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) defeat the army of Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria). As Christian Toto of What Would Toto Watch? wrote in his mostly negative review, “The best, and possibly only, reason to watch Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian is the enchanting Amy Adams.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1202764[/tomatometer]9. Sunshine CleaningIf you’re going to film a quirky indie comedy about a cheerleader-turned-hardworking single mom who decides to clean crime scenes for a living so she can send her son to private school, you could hardly find a better person for the role than Amy Adams. And while critics carped that the Christine Jeffs-directed Sunshine Cleaning was ultimately a little too burdened down with quirky indie cliches to achieve its full potential, they had nothing but kind words to say about Adams (as well as Emily Blunt, who played her not-so-sunny sister). Time Out’s David Jenkins reflected the opinions of many of his peers when he wrote, “Jeffs makes a good fist of the direction and Blunt proves that she can do comedy, but it’s Adams’s comforting, charismatic central turn which really gives the film its lift.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1159349[/tomatometer]8. Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky BobbyFor a year after getting her first big break in Catch Me If You Can, Adams remained unemployed, which might help explain why, after her critically hailed work in Junebug, she didn’t wait for another script with heavy arthouse appeal; instead, she opted for a trio of projects with a more, um, populist bent. The less said about The Ex and Underdog the better, but with 2006’s Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Adams received her first real opportunity to display her talent for daffy comedy — and do it opposite the king of the doofus, Will Ferrell, in the movie that Nick Schager of Lessons of Darkness described as “an astute cultural satire masquerading as an infectiously stupid-silly lark — or, perhaps, it’s the other way around.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1207146[/tomatometer]7. Julie &amp; JuliaTwo biopics in one, Nora Ephron’s Julie &amp; Julia interwove the tales of culinary legend Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and author Julie Powell (Adams), tracing Child’s early career alongside Powell’s decision to launch a blog dedicated to her attempt to spend a year cooking every recipe in Child’s Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Inviting direct comparison to Meryl Streep isn’t something most young actresses would be comfortable doing — and in fact, most critics did single out Streep’s performance, although that had more to do with Child’s famously winsome disposition than any flaws in Adams’ work. As David Edwards of the UK’s Daily Mirror wrote, “While both actresses deserve credit, it’s Streep who dominates and deserves to be put in contention for her third Oscar. Deftly playing the dotty masterchef — complete with a brilliantly squawking laugh — it’s an amusing but respectful imitation.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1188342[/tomatometer]6. Miss Pettigrew Lives for a DayIt might have languished in various stages of development for almost 70 years, but once Winifred Watson’s novel finally arrived in theaters, it proved to be worth the wait, if for no other reason than to provide a charmingly frothy showcase for its two stars. Frances McDormand stars as the titular Miss Pettigrew, an unsuccessful nanny who, realizing she’s about to be fired by her temp agency, snags an assignment meant for another employee — and thus finds herself in the wild and wonderful world of rising starlet Delysia Lafosse (Adams). It’s a role that calls for an actress with enough bubbly charm to make you believe she can not only inspire the love of three very different men, but change the world of a profoundly disillusioned woman in a single day — and Adams pulled it off, as attested by critics like Margaret Pomeranz of At the Movies, who wrote, “This delicious froth of an entertainment could have creaked all over the place and at times you feel it does, but Amy Adams is just magic, she lifts every role she takes on to absolutely delightful heights.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1196463[/tomatometer]5. DoubtAdams received her second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her work in John Patrick Shanley’s adaptation of his own stage play — and she was in good company, too: Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Viola Davis rounded out the quartet of Doubt stars earning Oscar nods, and Shanley himself was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. (They all came away empty-handed, but it’s being nominated that counts, right?) The role of Sister James was uniquely suited for Adams, taking advantage of her gift for portraying idealistic innocence while also giving her a chance to go toe-to-toe with Hoffman and Streep. A not-insignificant contingent of critics dismissed Doubt as excessively talky Oscar bait, but the majority echoed the sentiments of Total Film’s Neil Smith, who saw through its flaws: “Though Shanley’s first film as director since 1990 flop Joe Versus The Volcano never strays far from its theatrical origins, his unfussy direction and compelling script provide a perfect platform for his talented cast.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1174258[/tomatometer]4. Charlie Wilson’s WarA biopic about a Congressman’s efforts to increase American support for Afghan freedom fighters during the 1980s? Sounds like awfully dry stuff, but in the hands of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, director Mike Nichols, and a cast toplined by Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, Charlie Wilson’s War became something of an acidic tragicomedy — and a $119 million worldwide hit. Adams appears here as Bonnie Bach, a fictional composite of the real Charlie Wilson’s two top administrative aides; it’s sort of a thankless role, one that calls for little more than standing back and letting Hanks do his thing, but Adams continued her tradition of taking every opportunity to shine, holding her own against her far more famous co-star. “The story of Charlie Wilson’s War makes an engaging and amusing film,” wrote Emily S. Mendel of culturevulture.net, concluding, “Aaron Sorkin’s script is literate, intelligent, well-written, fast-paced and full of clever and cynical one-liners.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1148680[/tomatometer]3. JunebugBy 2005, Amy Adams had scored roles in a number of mainstream productions, including Serving Sara and The Wedding Date — but it wasn’t until she starred in a tiny $1 million indie film that people really understood what she could do. As the pregnant chatterbox Ashley Johnsten, Adams took what was technically a supporting part and walked away with Junebug, earning an Academy Award nomination in the process. Urban Cinefile described it as “an arthouse Meet the Parents,” and that isn’t an entirely inaccurate assessment of a story about a newlywed wife (Embeth Davidtz) meeting her husband’s family for the first time. Instead of a sweaty Ben Stiller, though, you get Adams — who is, in the words of CinePassion’s Fernando F. Croce, “simply magical, guileless and throbbing, sunniness fraught with desperation.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1184018[/tomatometer]2. EnchantedOn the surface, Enchanted is sort of silly — a self-parody from a studio whose trademark films have already been parodied to death. What makes it work, though, is just how darn smart the parody is — well, that and Amy Adams’ relentlessly charming performance as Giselle, the Disney princess whose journey from Andalasia to New York City moves the plot. Adams excels at playing characters with sunny dispositions, and Giselle was a perfect fit, even giving Adams the chance to wrap her lovely singing voice around some wonderfully tongue-in-cheek songs by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. A $340 million-plus hit that netted Adams a passel of award nominations, Enchanted also earned loud applause from critics like Mark Pfeiffer of Reel Times, who wrote that it “bubbles over with good cheer, due in large part to Adams for the wide-eyed optimism and innocence she brings to her irony-free performance.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1118711[/tomatometer]1. Catch Me If You CanPrior to Catch Me If You Can, Amy Adams’ filmography had been restricted to small parts in films like Drop Dead Gorgeous and Psycho Beach Party; her closest brush with fame came when she stepped into the Sarah Michelle Gellar role in Fox’s aborted Cruel Intentions spinoff, Manchester Prep. It only takes one prestigious project to turn a career around, though, and scoring a plum gig with a director as well-known as Steven Spielberg never hurts. Spielberg certainly thought Adams was destined for bigger things after her appearance as Brenda Strong, the candy striper who catches the eye of legendary teen con man Frank Abagnale, Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) — and he was right, although it took a few years for the rest of the world to catch up. Even if it didn’t translate to immediate success, working on Catch Me If You Can gave Adams an early opportunity to work with some of Hollywood’s finest; as Matthew Turner of ViewLondon noted, “Spielberg being Spielberg, he’s surrounded himself with the best that money can buy, from the superb cast to the characteristically superb score by John Williams, and the result is his most purely enjoyable film in ages.”In case you were wondering, here are Amy’s top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. Catch Me If You Can — 94%2. Enchanted — 90%3. Doubt — 90%4. Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day — 90%5. Charlie Wilson’s War — 88%6. Junebug — 88%7. Julie &amp; Julia — 87%8. Sunshine Cleaning — 85%9.

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!\nNow, obviously, Thanksgiving doesn’t have quite the rich cinematic tradition that certain other holidays have enjoyed, but we’ve still watched the fourth Thursday in November unfold on the big screen enough times to be able to devote this week’s Total Recall to our annual celebration of parades and good eats — specifically, to some of the most noteworthy not-so-thankful Thanksgivings in movie history. We’ve gathered together an eclectic group for our list, including old favorites (Hannah and Her Sisters), indie upstarts (The House of Yes), and even a critical dud or two. Plus, as a special bonus, we’ve included the trailer for a movie that never was — so tuck in your napkins, wait for Sis to say grace, and let’s all dig in!\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\n9. Alice’s Restaurant \nOnly in the 1960s could an 18-minute talking blues song by a 19-year-old white kid from New England become such a big hit that it inspired a movie helmed by an A-list director like Arthur Penn, but that’s exactly what happened with Arlo Guthrie’s “Alice’s Restaurant,” the rambling tale of how it came to pass that a pair of Massachusetts hippies found themselves dragged to court for illegally dumping garbage on Thanksgiving Day — only to watch the arresting officer break down in tears of frustration when he discovers that the presiding judge is blind and can’t see the glossy color photos meticulously taken of the scene of the crime. And you thought you had it bad, watching the parade on your grandmother’s couch! As a movie, Alice’s Restaurant is arguably most interesting as a 1960s relic, or an early example of meta filmmaking (the real-life Alice makes a cameo, and officer William “Obie” Obanhein stars as himself), but critics have been generally kind to it; as Roger Ebert succinctly put it, the movie is “good work in a minor key.”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\n7. Hannah and Her Sisters\nAh, Thanksgiving. What would it be without turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and lustfully eyeing your wife’s sister? Actually, most of us wouldn’t know about that last item on the list, but for Michael Caine in Woody Allen’s Hannah and Her Sisters, it’s a different story. The film opens with Caine’s Elliot conducting some Allen-esque hand wringing over his secret crush on his sister-in-law, Lee (Barbara Hershey), who he takes every opportunity to “bump into” around town (Manhattan, natch). It makes for a rather uncomfortable holiday for Elliot — but few writers do grown-up angst as well as Allen, and he was near the top of his game here; as Combustible Celluloid‘s Jeffrey M. Anderson wrote, “It’s a masterwork.” (Hannah‘s final act centers around a different kind of Thanksgiving celebration, but we don’t want to spoil the ending for you here.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\n5. The Ice Storm \nWhat do Ang Lee and Christina Ricci have against Thanksgiving, anyway? In her second appearance on this list, Ricci plays Wendy Hood, one in the series of cynical, borderline misanthropic teens she portrayed in the 1990s — and in a slight (albeit far less humorous) echo of her turn as Wednesday Addams in Addams Family Values, she uses Thanksgiving as an opportunity to lift the veil on the holiday’s darker side, delivering a soliloquy about the inherent cruelty of the celebration. Painful to watch? Indubitably — and appropriately, for a film that hinges on crushing ennui and alienation. Lee, who also directed Brokeback Mountain, which appears elsewhere on this list, received high marks for adapting Rick Moody’s tense, sad novel about suburban families in the 1970s; as the Globe and Mail‘s Rick Groen put it, Lee manages to “[duplicate] on screen exactly what the writer achieves on the page.”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\n3. The House of Yes\nWe’ve covered some unbearably awkward Thanksgivings on this list, but Tori Spelling’s holiday in The House of Yes — which finds her joining her fiancee’s family for the meal, meeting them for the first time, only to discover that his relationship with his mentally unstable twin sister is much more, ahem, complex than she’d been led to believe. Matter of fact, pretty much everyone in the family has some something lurking under the surface, and much of it will become known to poor Tori before the weekend is over. And did we mention there’s a hurricane going on during all of this? Don’t feel too bad for Ms. Spelling, though — for one of the only times in her career, she earned some of the movie’s highest marks, including praise from TV Guide‘s Ken Fox, who declared her House‘s “real surprise,” calling her “perfectly cast as a lamb among wolves, and her naivete is strangely affecting.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\n1. Planes, Trains and Automobiles \nPerhaps the quintessential Thanksgiving film, Planes, Trains and Automobiles represents a critical and commercial high point for all of its principals, including Steve Martin (as repressed ad executive Neal Page), John Candy (as unintentionally obnoxious shower curtain ring salesman Del Griffith), and John Hughes (as the writer and director of a film not starring Molly Ringwald). On its face, there’s very little about Planes to distinguish it from other films — how many 1980s movies feature an uptight ad exec going on some kind of transformative journey, anyway? — and where John Hughes goes, broad humor inevitably follows. But Martin and Candy play off one another brilliantly, and if any movie deserves to have a big, gooey heart beating at its center, shouldn’t it be one about the true meaning of Thanksgiving?.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","section":"Total Recall","tags":"of, Awards, laika, Kemper, comedy, Legendary, green, Watching, blockbusters, Out, CW, crime","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Not-So-Happy-Movie-Thanksgivings"},{"id":"47508991610496","title":"Total Recall: Seth Rogen’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Seth Rogen's Best MoviesWe take a look at the Observe and Report star's most critically-acclaimed work.by Jeff Giles | April 8, 2009 |  CommentsFive years ago, all Seth Rogen really had going for him were roles in a pair of quickly canceled television shows and bit parts in Donnie Darko and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy — but in Hollywood, fortunes can change quickly, and this Friday, Rogen will return to theaters with his fourth live-action leading role in the last two years, as mall security guard Ronnie Barnhardt in Jody Hill’s Observe and Report. At the tender age of 26, Rogen has already put together such an impressive résumé that we thought now would be the perfect time to devote an installment of Total Recall to his best-reviewed movies.Rogen rose to fame as a member of Judd Apatow’s troupe — he received his first big break as a member of the Freaks and Geeks cast, and Apatow elevated him to leading man status with 2007’s Knocked Up — and although it’s true that many of Rogen’s roles have been in Apatow comedies (or movies that just seem like Apatow comedies), he’s done more than you might think, including voicework for some popular animated fare, production work on many of his films, and writing for projects as varied as Da Ali G Show and Drillbit Taylor. Okay, maybe that last one wasn’t a very good example of his talents, but still, you have to admit — for a guy who wasn’t even on most people’s radar in the not-too-distant past, Seth Rogen has come an awfully long way. Join us in taking a look at the highlights of a brief-yet-busy career — and then visit Rogen’s complete filmography to learn more![tomatometer]MuzeID=1164043[/tomatometer]10. You, Me and DupreeEven the most impressive filmography has a stinker or two lurking in the weeds, and Seth Rogen’s is no different. Fortunately for him, his lowest-rated movie, 2006’s You, Me and Dupree, didn’t feature much Rogen — it was a starring vehicle for Owen Wilson, Kate Hudson, and Matt Dillon, and Rogen only turned up in a supporting role as Neil, a mutual friend of the uptight Carl (Dillon) and lovably irresponsible Dupree (Wilson). In theory, the story of an innocent man-child slowly driving an uptight acquaintance insane is rife with humorous possibilities — see What About Bob? — but critics found few laughs in Dupree; although the film was a moderate hit, the reviews were almost uniformly awful. Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe summed up the overall feeling of most writers when he claimed that watching it “made me feel like Lou Dobbs. I didn’t like Dupree. I wanted him deported.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190296[/tomatometer]9. Zack and Miri Make a PornoRogen took a furlough from Camp Apatow for Zack and Miri Make a Porno, taking advantage of the opportunity to work for Kevin Smith, the director who redefined mainstream raunch with films such as Mallrats — and who demonstrated, with movies like Chasing Amy, that a successful script can be filthy and sweetly sentimental. Smith tried to walk that line with Zack and Miri, which starred Rogen and Elizabeth Banks as a pair of longtime friends who turn to porn as a way of paying their bills; unfortunately, it wasn’t an Amy-sized success, providing only limited critical and commercial returns despite a hot cast and potential-filled premise. Still, Zack and Miri ended up on the right side of 60 percent on the Tomatometer, thanks to reviews from critics like Creative Loafing’s Matt Brunson, who deemed it “Always likable even if it isn’t always inspired.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1188393[/tomatometer]8. Pineapple ExpressAfter channeling the spirit of the ’80s teen comedy for Superbad, Rogen and his screenwriting partner revisited another of the decade’s favorite genres for Pineapple Express: the action buddy comedy. It was marketed as a stoner comedy, and while it certainly contained a fair amount of weed-themed humor, Express was essentially an homage to such squabbling-friends-in-peril classics as Stir Crazy and Running Scared — although it bears pointing out that none of those movies had the benefit of a brief, spectacularly profane appearance by Ed Begley, Jr. Critics weren’t unanimous in their support of the $101 million hit, which starred Rogen and James Franco as a ganja-loving process server and his dealer on the run from a lunatic crimelord — and the theme song, sadly, did not result in a “Back in Time”-sized hit for Huey Lewis — but most scribes agreed with TIME’s Richard Corliss, who deemed Express “A comedy that brings a nicely deflating note of realism to action-film mayhem, as well as being one of the few drug movies you don’t have to be high to enjoy.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1194516[/tomatometer]7. Monsters vs. AliensFor his latest foray into the vocal booth, Rogen had the opportunity few actors are given — namely, to assume the role of a brainless, one-eyed blob created by injecting chemically altered ranch dressing into a genetically engineered tomato. Oh, and that’s not all — Monsters vs. Aliens marked the first time an animated feature was produced in 3-D start to finish, rather than converted after the fact, meaning Rogen was able to get his blob on while helping make movie history. It’s only been out a few weeks, so Aliens‘ final commercial fate has yet to be decided, but seeing as how it’s topped $100 million in domestic grosses in under a month, it seems safe to say the movie is a hit. The critical response has been more mixed, with some writers decrying what they see as an emphasis on visual thrills at the expense of an involving story or fully developed characters, but at 72 percent on the Tomatometer, most reviews have expressed sentiments similar to the Arizona Republic’s Bill Goodykoontz, who wrote, “don’t overthink Monsters vs. Aliens. Just enjoy it.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1184824[/tomatometer]6. Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who!By the time Zack and Miri and Pineapple Express came out in 2008, Seth Rogen seemed more or less inescapable at the box office — but his high-profile roles in hit comedies only told half the story, because ’08 also saw Rogen lending his distinctive pipes to a trio of animated characters, including the part of Morton the Mouse in Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who! As the plucky rodent sidekick of Jim Carrey’s Horton, Rogen helped this CG-animated adaptation of the classic children’s book lumber to a pachyderm-sized $297 million gross — at least partially erasing the sour aftertaste left by Carrey’s last Seuss-inspired trip to the cineplex, 2000’s garish How the Grinch Stole Christmas! Critics enjoyed the new spin on Horton almost as much as audiences, certifying it Fresh behind a slew of reviews echoing the sentiments of the Hollywood Reporter’s Kirk Honeycutt, who called it “a delight, brimming with colorful, elastic characters and bountiful wit.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1183863[/tomatometer]5. The Spiderwick ChroniclesSince the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings movies started raking in incredible amounts of money at the box office, just about every studio in Hollywood has tried to set up its own kid-wiz franchise, and though most would-be sequel machines have missed their goal — The Golden Compass, anyone? — some of them, like The Spiderwick Chronicles, have deserved better than being lumped in with The Bridge to Terabithia and limping to $70 million in receipts. In any case, you can hardly fault Spiderwick‘s underwhelming theatrical run on its cast, which included a much-praised starring turn from Freddie Highmore and voicework from Nick Nolte, Martin Short, and — of course — Seth Rogen as the eructative hobgoblin known as Hogsqueal. Director Mark Waters’ adaptation of the popular novels by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi didn’t exactly catch on with moviegoers, but critics appreciated its dark overtones and powerful emotional core; the New York Observer’s Rex Reed, for instance, praised it for “[holding] the interest without unbalancing the I.Q.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1149494[/tomatometer]4. The 40-Year-Old VirginThe R-rated comedy went through some lean years in the ’90s and early ’00s, but by the middle of the decade, studios were willing to bet on grown-ups wanting to laugh again, and Judd Apatow — and, in turn, Seth Rogen — gave them plenty to laugh at, starting with 2005’s The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Rogen plays second fiddle here, appearing as a pot-smoking friend and co-worker to Steve Carell’s titular paragon of chastity, but this is no ordinary supporting role — not only does he get some of the movie’s most memorable lines (including a particularly quote-friendly exchange with Paul Rudd’s character), but he earned a production credit on the film, showing some of the behind-the-scenes acumen that has helped make him more of a budding mogul than your average 26-year-old movie star. Whether or not people went to see it for Rogen, The 40-Year-Old Virgin was a huge hit, making more than $175 million at the box office, and critics enjoyed it too: The Globe and Mail’s Jason Anderson spoke for many of his peers when he wrote, “If only losing it was so good for everybody.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1183404[/tomatometer]3. SuperbadIt isn’t at all uncommon for high school buddies to daydream about growing up and making it big together — or for aspiring screenwriters to pen their first scripts before they’re old enough to vote. Most of them don’t have the patience to nurture an idea for over a decade, or the luck necessary to take your idea to the box office — but that’s exactly what Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg did with Superbad. Of course, it didn’t hurt having a pair of leads as buzz-friendly as Jonah Hill and Michael Cera, or being able to introduce Christopher Mintz-Plasse as the one and only McLovin — but Superbad‘s real strength lies in the way Rogen and Goldberg’s sweetly funny script blends honest moments with gross-out gags and absurdist humor (including a surreal extended cameo from Rogen and Bill Hader as a pair of spectacularly incompetent police officers). At 87 percent on the Tomatometer, Superbad received no shortage of love from critics like Roger Ebert, who pronounced it “A four-letter raunch-a-rama with a heart.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1174378[/tomatometer]2. Kung Fu PandaWhile it may not have collected quite as many critical palm fronds — or inspired the sort of impassioned political debate — as Pixar’s WALL-E, DreamWorks’ Kung Fu Panda did just fine for itself, earning over $600 million in worldwide grosses and a very respectable 89 percent on the Tomatometer, thanks to reviews from the likes of the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick LaSalle, who credited it with “[getting] across important and inevitable plot information in ways that are novel and unexpected.” It was yet another link in an increasingly impressive chain of well-chosen projects for Rogen, who lent his voice to Master Mantis, one of the quintet of talking creatures trained to protect the Valley of Peace threatened by the villainous leopard Tai Lung. While voicing the diminutive martial arts master may not have given Rogen as much of the spotlight as some of his other recent projects, it put him in excellent company — including Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, and Jack Black, just to name a few — and provided a guaranteed paycheck for the inevitable sequel, scheduled to arrive in 2011.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1174220[/tomatometer]1. Knocked UpTwo years after helping Steve Carell break a 40-year streak of sexual inactivity, Seth Rogen played a character on the verge of a different sort of threshold — namely, fatherhood — in Knocked Up. The movie also presented a career Rubicon of sorts for Rogen; after playing a secondary character in Virgin, he moved into the ranks of unconventional comedic leading men with Knocked Up, starring opposite Katherine Heigl as the ambition-deficient half of a couple thrown together by the unplanned results of a one-night stand. It was Rogen’s fourth project with Judd Apatow, and the basic, seemingly effortless likability that the director had seen in his star since their Freaks and Geeks days resonated with audiences — to the tune of nearly $220 million in box office receipts — and helped earn Knocked Up some of the best reviews of the year. Salon’s Stephanie Zacharek was one of the many critics who found it Fresh, praising what she saw as “a picture that refuses to fetishize either the ability to conceive or the significance of our place in the universe once we’ve done so.”Don’t forget to check out out Seth Rogen’s complete filmography, and see the rest of our Total Recall archives.Finally, we take you back to where it all began, with Rogen’s audition for Freaks and Geeks:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"spain, bond, toy, Hallmark, star, rom-coms, Syfy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Seth-Rogens-Best-Movies"},{"id":"47508991619716","title":"Total Recall: Best Live-Action Disney Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Best Live-Action Disney MoviesWhich of the Mouse House's family-friendly romps comes out on top?by Jeff Giles | March 12, 2009 |  CommentsWe tend to think of Walt Disney Pictures as chiefly an animation studio — and with good reason — but the house Uncle Walt built has been churning out quality (and often highly profitable) live-action entertainment since the 1950s, something we were reminded of when we noticed that the latest chapter in the Witch Mountain franchise (and the Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s latest bid for the undisputed heavyweight champion of kid-friendly cinema), Race to Witch Mountain, was landing in theaters this Friday. What better time, then, for your pals here at Rotten Tomatoes to devote a Total Recall list to the 10 best-reviewed live-action entries in the Disney canon?Of course, not all of Disney’s live-action efforts have been critical winners — we’re guessing Condorman is discussed as infrequently as possible at the Mouse House — but not everything that missed the list was a dud: You’ll find plenty of the classics you remember (yes, Old Yeller is present and accounted for), but you’re bound to take umbrage with a few omissions. Some movies missed the cut on technicalities — we limited our scope to films without animation (so long, Bedknobs and Broomsticks) and crossed any co-productions off the list, too (thus sparing Operation Dumbo Drop the embarrassment of being disqualified on critical grounds). Others, however, simply didn’t have the reviews — something we think says a lot about the strength of the competition. So let’s see what we ended up with, shall we? The live-action world of Disney awaits![tomatometer]MuzeID=1006728[/tomatometer]10. Escape to Witch MountainWell, well, well. How’s this for perfect? Not only did it provide a starting point for this week’s Total Recall honoree, 1975’s Escape to Witch Mountain wound up making the list itself. While not the best-remembered of Disney’s 1970s properties, this adaptation of the Alexander Key novel helped kickstart a mini-franchise that eventually extended to 1978’s Return from Witch Mountain, a 1982 TV movie and 1995 made-for-TV remake, and, of course, 2009’s Race to Witch Mountain. Placing extraordinary kids in situations of nail-biting, grown-up peril is something Disney has always done well, and Escape is no exception; psychic alien twins Tony and Tia are literally running for their lives from creepy millionaire Aristotle Bolt (Ray Milland). Though not all critics were susceptible to its charm — Vincent Canby of the New York Times called it “a Walt Disney production for children who will watch absolutely anything that moves” — most scribes took its popcorn-flavored blend of action, sci-fi, and family drama at face value, including Roger Ebert, who called it “a sci-fi thriller that’s fun, that’s cheerfully implausible, that’s scary but not too scary, and it works.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1000208[/tomatometer]9. The Absent-Minded ProfessorNo list of the Disney live-action oeuvre would be complete without a mention of Fred MacMurray’s work for the studio. Although he’d been a major film star for decades before making his Disney debut with 1960’s The Shaggy Dog, it’s MacMurray’s late-period string of pipe-puffing father types that he’s arguably best remembered for, particularly among younger film fans. The most critically successful of these movies, 1961’s The Absent-Minded Professor, casts MacMurray in the title role as Ned Brainard, the accidental inventor of an incredible energy-producing substance known as Flubber. Over the course of the film, Brainerd uses Flubber to make himself look like a talented dancer and helps an entire basketball team cheat during the big game, but thanks to MacMurray’s Everyman charm, you still believe he’s the good guy. It’s goofy, and light as a feather, but Disney has always known how to make the most of those two ingredients; as TV Guide put it, “This is a zanily inventive piece of work, with delightful special effects, which set the style for a long series of live-action Disney films.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1020736[/tomatometer]8. Swiss Family RobinsonEven in the context of the other classic films in the Disney vaults, 1960’s Swiss Family Robinson was a huge success — its $40 million gross is equivalent to $367 million in today’s money, placing it proudly among the ranks of the most successful G-rated films of all time. Johann David Wyss’ 1812 novel has been adapted on numerous occasions, for film and television, but Disney’s Ken Annakin-directed treatment is the most well-known; although it doesn’t skimp on the cheesy dialogue and cornpone wholesomeness that came prepackaged with many of the studio’s live-action efforts, Lowell S. Hawley’s screenplay does a fine job of drawing enough swashbuckling action and tropical derring-do out of the source material to guarantee a good time for viewers of all (okay, most) ages. Channel 4 Film’s Alistair Harkness spoke for many of his peers when he wrote, “It’s no Pirates Of The Caribbean, but the spirit of adventure, and Disney’s high production values, means that there’s still some fun to be had watching this wholesome family adapt to island life.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1016512[/tomatometer]7. PollyannaHayley Mills, like Tommy Kirk before her (and countless fresh-faced Disney teen starlets after her), became a household name thanks to a string of starring roles in Disney live-action films. Mills’ six-movie run got off to a pretty good start with 1960’s Pollyanna; although its box office performance was initially something of a disappointment for the studio, Mills won a special Academy Award for her performance. For many, the film is now considered one of Disney’s earliest live-action classics; though Disney was far from the first to adapt Eleanor Porter’s novel, it’s Mills that people usually think of when they hear the name “Pollyanna” — and for good reason, as even critics who overdosed on the movie’s relentless optimism, like the Time critic who called it “a Niagara of drivel and a masterpiece of smarm,” were often swayed by her performance. Variety, for instance, said her presence “more than compensates for the film’s lack of tautness and, at certain points, what seems to be an uncertain sense of direction.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1112954[/tomatometer]6. The RookieBy 2002, the “inspirational sports movie” genre was seen as well past its prime — and so was Dennis Quaid: one of the more bankable matinee idols of the 1980s, Quaid was suffering through a dry spell when he signed on for Disney’s John Lee Hancock-directed dramatization of the brief-yet-noteworthy Major League Baseball career of high school teacher-turned-Tampa Bay Devil Ray pitcher Jimmy Morris. Like Morris himself, The Rookie was initially written off by many as an amiable relic of a bygone era — but try as they might, most critics were too charmed by its true-life inspirational story, and Quaid’s refreshingly low-key performance, to be cynical about the film. The Rookie earned a healthy return on Disney’s $22 million investment, kick-started a new chapter in Quaid’s career, and earned a surprising number of endorsements from critics like Looking Closer’s Jeffrey Overstreet, who called it “one of those rare, wonderful ‘formula’ films that … favors understatement over exaggeration, subtlety over sentimentality.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1015944[/tomatometer]5. The Parent TrapFor a relatively lightweight rom-com, The Parent Trap has enjoyed an incredibly long life; not only was the original film re-released to theaters seven years after its theatrical debut, but Hayley Mills ended up reprising her dual roles for a trio of made-for-TV sequels more than 20 years later — and the career-boosting power of the story of matchmaking twins who play Cupid for their divorced parents proved every bit as potent in 1998, when Lindsay Lohan starred in a remake. Part of Trap‘s appeal no doubt came from its pioneering use of the trick photography that made it appear as though Mills was actually her own twin — a technique later used to notable effect on The Patty Duke Show two years later — but even without special effects, The Parent Trap is a solid, albeit proudly corny, film that benefits from a strong performance by its winsome star. Mills’ charms were even sufficient to win over more “serious” publications, such as Time, whose reviewer wrote, “Surprisingly, the film is delightful — mostly because of 15-year-old Hayley Mills, the blonde button nose who played the endearing delinquent in Tiger Bay.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1000079[/tomatometer]4. 20,000 Leagues Under the SeaWhether you attribute it to beginner’s luck or the steady hand of one of Hollywood’s most quality-conscious studios, it’s worth noting that Richard Fleischer’s adaptation of Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is both one of Disney’s most highly regarded live-action efforts and its first foray into science fiction. Proving he had an eye for giant squid battles to match his knack for animating adorable fauna, Walt Disney personally produced 20,000 Leagues, helping Fleischer blend an attentive eye to period detail with a rip-roaring action yarn that just happened to have strong Cold War parallels (right down to the mushroom cloud witnessed after the climactic battle). Enlisting the talents of A-list stars like Kirk Douglas, James Mason, and Peter Lorre certainly didn’t hurt Leagues‘ box-office prospects — nor did glowingly positive reviews from the likes of the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther, who called it “as fabulous and fantastic as anything [Disney] has ever done in cartoons.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1021130[/tomatometer]3. That Darn Cat!Younger filmgoers may be more familiar with the 1997 remake, starring Christina Ricci and Doug E. Doug — which, as illustrated by that film’s woeful seven percent Tomatometer rating, is a shame. The 1965 original, starring Hayley Mills as the owner of a robbery-foiling feline (and the immortal Frank Gorshin as the robber), was a perfect example of the sort of goofy, animal-assisted middlebrow flick that Disney’s live-action arm became known for in the 1960s — but if it’s silly stuff, it’s at least eminently well-crafted, thanks to the steady hand of director Robert Stevenson and charming performances from a cast that included Disney vets Mills and Dean Jones. Critics were kind, if not exactly effusive (Rob Thomas of Madison’s Capital Times waved it off as “lightweight, forgettable family fun”) — but it was the titular cat that earned some of the movie’s highest warmest praise, including high marks from the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther, who said, “The feline that plays the informant, as the F.B.I. puts it, is superb. Clark Gable at the peak of his performing never played a tom cat more winningly.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1015461[/tomatometer]2. Old YellerA movie so successful that it spawned a sequel, Tommy Kirk’s career, and the heartbreaking on-screen deaths of dozens of beloved critters, Old Yeller is mostly remembered today for its tearjerking final act and cornpone dialogue — and although this Robert Stevenson-directed adaptation of Fred Gipson’s popular novel certainly doesn’t skimp on the familiar plot points and gooey nostalgia so often identified with the Disney films of the era, it also tries to impart some useful lessons about the tough choices that come with growing up. Those lessons were imparted to a huge audience, too — watching Old Yeller was a rite of passage for multiple generations of filmgoers, among them DVDTalk’s Scott Weinberg, who called it “every bit the warm, comfortable, and tragically bittersweet classic that had you sobbing like a infant the first time you saw it.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1014828[/tomatometer]1. Never Cry WolfThe best-reviewed of Disney’s late 1970s/early 1980s string of family-friendly live-action flicks, Never Cry Wolf offers a surprisingly mature, unflinching adaptation of Farley Mowat’s memoir detailing the years he spent studying the hunting habits of wolves in the Canadian wilderness. One year later, Disney would spin off Touchstone, an imprint which would eventually be responsible for some fairly racy fare, but in 1983, Wolf director Carroll Ballard’s decision to afford audiences a glimpse of Charles Martin Smith’s bare buttocks was a major step for the Mouse House. Though the film wasn’t a giant hit, it did manage an impressive 27-week theatrical run — all the more notable considering its small cast, exceedingly minimal dialogue, and deliberate pace. Critics were suitably impressed, sending Never Cry Wolf all the way to a 100 percent Tomatometer rating on the strength of reviews from scribes like Time’s Richard Schickel, who raved, “Ballard and his masterly crew of film makers have reimagined a corner of the natural world…They leave us awed.”Check out the rest of our Total Recall archives here.Finally, we leave you with a clip from one of Disney’s trippiest live-action offerings.

We at Rotten Tomatoes figured it was a good time to run down every single feature film that’s up for an Oscar, as well as compiling other major awards season honors each movie has received. And of course, we’ve included the Tomatometers for each film, lest the critics be lost in the shuffle.Departures – N/AOscar Nomination: Best Foreign FilmOther Major Awards: NoneDepartures, Japan’s Academy Award entry, has yet to be distributed in the United States. The film, which tells the story of an unemployed cellist who becomes a funeral professional, gained some recognition on the festival circuit.The Garden – N/AOscar Nomination: Best DocumentaryOther Major Awards: NoneScott Hamilton Kennedy’s doc about a 14-acre community garden in Los Angeles, has yet to see a theatrical release.

In addition, the pundits felt Angelina Jolie’s haunted turn as a woman in search of her kidnapped son took the sometimes staid proceedings to another level.Revolutionary Road (71% )Oscar Nominations (3): Best Supporting Actor (Michael Shannon),Best Art Direction (Kristi Zea and Debra Schutt), Best Costume Design (Albert Wolsky)Other Major Awards: Golden Globe, Best Actress in a Drama (Kate Winslet)Sam Mendes’ finely-crafted adaptation of Richard Yates’ tale of suburban malaise failed to garner an Oscar nom for his wife, Kate Winslet. However, the pristine recreations of 1950s fashion and design got the attention of the Academy, as did Michael Shannon’s brief but potent turn as a mental patient who sees through the phoniness surrounding him.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (71% )Oscar Nominations (13): Best Picture, Best Director (David Fincher),Best Actor (Brad Pitt), Best Supporting Actress (Taraji P. Henson),Best Adapted Screenplay (Eric Roth and Robin Swicord), Best Cinematography (Claudio Miranda),Best Editing (Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall), Best Costume Design (Jacqueline West),Best Art Direction (Donald Graham Burt and Victor J. Zolfo), Best Visual Effects (Eric Barba, Steve Preeg, Burt Dalton, and Craig Barron),Best Makeup (Greg Cannom), Best Score (Alexandre Desplat), Best Sound Mixing (David Parker, Michael Semanick, Ren Klyce, and Mark Weingarten)Other Major Awards: BAFTA, Best Make Up &amp; Hair (Jean Ann Black and Colleen Callaghan), Best Production Design (Burt and Zolfo), Best Special Visual Effects (Barba, Barron, Nathan McGuinness, and Edson Williams)David Fincher’s elegiac epic about a man who ages in reverse may be the second-worst-reviewed Best Picture nominee, but it still garnered the most Oscar noms, with a whopping 13. The poignancy of the story is abetted by a crack team of tech pros, who crafted dazzling visual effects and turned movie star Brad Pitt from an old man to a baby.Wanted (72% )Oscar Nominations (2): Best Sound Mixing (Chris Jenkins, Frank A. Montaño, and Petr Forejt),Best Sound Editing (Wylie Stateman)Other Major Awards: NoneWanted may not be the stuff that Best Picture winners are made of. However, when a movie is designed to be an assault on the senses, and the Academy hands out two nominations for sound, you can say it did its job.Doubt (77% )Oscar Nominations (5): Best Actress (Meryl Streep), Best Supporting Actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman),Best Supporting Actress (Viola Davis), Best Supporting Actress (Amy Adams),Best Adapted Screenplay (John Patrick Shanley)Other Major Awards: Screen Actors Guild, Best Actress (Streep)A true ensemble piece, Doubt is a powerful showcase for some of cinema’s finest acting talents. Streep and Hoffman aren’t strangers to awards season recognition, but Davis, who has one of the film’s smallest roles, finally jumped to the big time.Revanche (80% )Oscar Nomination: Best Foreign FilmOther Major Awards: NoneThis Austrian thriller was a festival favorite in Europe, bagging three awards at Berlin in 2008 (it’s slated for a domestic release in March). Revanche follows two couples, one from Vienna and one from the countryside, whose lives intersect in the wake of a bank robbery.In Bruges (81% )Oscar Nomination: Best Original Screenplay (Martin McDonagh)Other Major Awards: BAFTA, Best Original Screenplay (McDonagh)In Bruges is a darkly comic crime flick about an ominous vacation in an idyllic town. Director Martin McDonagh’s witty, bleakly funny script crackles with sharp dialogue and some of the strangest scenarios that have ever entangled big-screen hit men.The Baader-Meinhof Complex (82% )Oscar Nomination: Best Foreign FilmOther Major Awards: NoneNominated for a Best Foreign Film Golden Globe, this German film is based upon the true story of the Red Army Faction, a group responsible for a number of terrorist acts in the 1970s. It was directed by Uli Edel, best known in the US for Last Exit to Brooklyn and Body of Evidence.Vicky Cristina Barcelona (82% )Oscar Nomination: Best Supporting Actress (Penelope Cruz)Other Major Awards: BAFTA, Best Supporting Actress (Cruz); Golden Globes, Best Comedy or MusicalAs the tormented on-again,-off-again love interest of Javier Bardem in Vicky Christina Barcelona, Penelope Cruz put the fou in amour fou. Woody Allen’s engaging tale of study-abroad love affairs is also up for three Independent Spirit Awards.Tropic Thunder (83% )Oscar Nomination: Best Supporting Actor (Robert Downey Jr.)Other Major Awards: NoneIn one of the funniest examples of life imitating art, Robert Downey Jr. picked up an Oscar nomination by playing five-time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder. In addition, he dispensed priceless wisdom to co-star Ben Stiller about the Academy’s predilection for actors playing mentally-challenged characters.Frozen River (86% )Oscar Nominations (2): Best Actress (Melissa Leo), Best Original Screenplay (Courtney Hunt)Other Major Awards: NoneVeteran character actress Melissa Leo finally got her chance to shine in this powerful tale of a woman facing financial hardship. Writer/director Courtney Hunt’s sharply observant script and picturesque, foreboding visuals make Frozen River a little movie the Academy couldn’t ignore. It’s also up for seven Independent Spirit Awards.Rachel Getting Married (86% )Oscar Nomination: Best Actress (Anne Hathaway)Other Major Awards: NoneAnne Hathaway’s outstanding performance as a woman just out of rehab and with the potential to wreak havoc on her sister’s wedding was the centerpiece of Jonathon Demme’s fine ensemble drama. Rachel Getting Married is also up for six Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Director and Best Feature.Bolt (87% )Oscar Nomination: Best Animated FeatureOther Major Awards: NoneFor dog-lovers, 2008 was a good year at the movies. Unfortunately, only one cinematic canine caught the Academy’s attention: Bolt, the titular hero of Disney’s animated comedy/adventure, who is under the false impression that his status as a TV star means he has superpowers in real life.Kung Fu Panda (88% )Oscar Nomination: Best Animated FeatureOther Major Awards: Annie Awards, Best Animated Feature, Best Directing (Mark Osborne and John Stevenson), Best Animated Effects (Li-Ming “Lawrence” Lee), Best Character Animation (James Baxter), Best Character Design (Nicolas Marlet), Best Music (Hans Zimmer and John Powell), Best Production Design (Tang Kheng Heng), Best Storyboarding (Jennifer Yuh), Best Voice Acting (Dustin Hoffman), Best Writing (Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger)WALL-E looked like a shoo-in to take home the Best Animated Feature Oscar until Kung Fu Panda dominated the Annie Awards. The voters may have Pixar fatigue, but there’s no denying the infectious exuberance of this inspirational martial arts comedy.Hellboy II: The Golden Army (88% )Oscar Nomination: Best Makeup (Mike Elizalde and Thomas Floutz)Golden Tomato Awards: Best Science Fiction/FantasyOther Major Awards: NoneGuillermo del Toro has a way of turning pulp into high art. In creating the wild demonic landscape of Helboy II: the Golden Army, the Mexican maestro is ably abetted by a crack team of makeup artists, whose work was too devilishly good for the Academy to miss.The Betrayal (Nerakhoon) (91% )Oscar Nomination: Best DocumentaryOther Major Awards: NoneThe Betrayal follows more than 20 years in the lives of a family forced to emigrate to America from Laos because of the US’s covert bombing campaign during the Vietnam War. This deeply moving, often gut-wrenching documentary is also up for an Independent Spirit Award.The Visitor (91% )Oscar Nomination: Best Actor (Richard Jenkins)Other Major Awards: NoneRichard Jenkins told the ladies of The View that he has “not a chance in the world” of taking home an Oscar for his performance in The Visitor. While such self-deprecation is refreshing, it minimizes his powerful work as a lonely college professor whose life is changed when he befriends an illegal immigrant squatting in his apartment. The Visitor is also thrice nominated at the Spirit Awards.Frost/Nixon (91% )Oscar Nominations (5): Best Picture, Best Director(Ron Howard), Best Actor (Frank Langella), Best Editing (Mike Hill and Daniel P. Hanley),Best Adapted Screenplay (Peter Morgan)Other Major Awards: NoneRon Howard is a veritable Oscar-nomination-generating machine. Frost/Nixon, his account of the tense interviews between the former president and the self-promoting British TV personality, is no exception, though it’s unlikely to duplicate the Oscar performance of Apollo 13 or A Beautiful Mind.Happy-Go-Lucky (92% )Oscar Nomination: Best Original Screenplay (Mike Leigh)Golden Tomato Awards: Best ComedyOther Major Awards: Golden Globes, Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical (Sally Hawkins)Tough break for Sally Hawkins: she was an early dark horse Best Actress candidate for her performance as a perpetually-sunny schoolteacher in Mike Leigh’s Happy-Go-Lucky. Odder still was Leigh’s nomination for Best Screenplay, since the British director is famous for drafting his scripts collectively with his actors.Milk (93% )Oscar Nominations (8): Best Picture, Best Director (Gus Van Sant),Best Actor (Sean Penn), Best Supporting Actor (Josh Brolin), Best Original Screenplay(Dustin Lance Black), Best Editing (Elliot Graham), Best Score (Danny Elfman),Best Costume Design (Danny Glicker)Other Major Awards: Screen Actors Guild, Best Actor (Penn); Writers Guild of America, Best Original Screenplay (Black); Producers Guild of America, Stanley Kramer AwardGus Van Sant’s powerful biopic of the first openly gay public official in the United States is the kind of high-minded fare the Academy loves. That doesn’t mean the Academy isn’t spot on sometimes, as Milk features a driven central performance from Sean Penn.Iron Man (93% )Oscar Nominations (2): Best Visual Effects (John Nelson, Ben Snow, Daniel Sudick, and Shane Mahan),Best Sound Editing (Frank E. Eulner and Christopher Boyes)Other Major Awards: NoneAnother year, another spot on the Fortune 500 for Tony Stark of Stark Industries…. What’s that you say? We’re talking Oscars? Oh, right. Iron Man is up for two technical awards; unfortunately, Black Sabbath’s “Iron Man” is not up for Best Song.Encounters at the End of the World (94% )Oscar Nomination: Best DocumentaryOther Major Awards: NoneWerner Herzog is a man who will go to the ends of the earth to create compelling cinema, so it’s nice the Academy has finally granted him a nomination. Encounters finds the eccentric legend in Antarctica, documenting both the hazardous landscape and the people who live and work there. Herzog’s critically acclaimed doc is also up for an Independent Spirit Award.Slumdog Millionaire (94% )Oscar Nominations (10): Best Picture, Best Director(Danny Boyle), Best Editing (Chris Dickens), Best Cinematography (Anthony Dod Mantle),Best Score (A.R. Rahman), Best Adapted Screenplay (Simon Beaufoy),Best Sound Editing (Tom Sayers and Glenn Freemantle), Best SoundMixing (Ian Tapp, Richard Pryke and Resul Pookutty), Best Original Song (“O Saya,” “Jai Ho”)Other Major Awards: Golden Globes, Best Drama, Best Director (Boyle), Best Score (Rahman), Best Screenplay (Beaufoy); BAFTA, Best Film, Best Director (Boyle), Best Editing (Dickens), Best Adapted Screenplay (Beaufoy), Best Cinematography (Mantle), Best Music (Rahman), Best Sound (Freemantle, Pookutty, Pryke, Sayers and Tapp); Producers Guild of America, Best Picture; Screen Actors Guild, Best Cast; Writers Guild of America, Best Adapted Screenplay (Beaufoy); American Cinema Editors, Best Edited Feature Film (Dickens); American Society of Cinematographers, Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography (Mantle)The best-reviewed Best Picture nominee is also one of this awards season’s most decorated films. This crowd-pleasing tale of a teenager who uses his street smarts to make it big on a nationally televised game show is considered one of the leading contenders for Best Picture.The Dark Knight (94% )Oscar Nominations (8): Best Supporting Actor (Heath Ledger),Best Cinematography (Wally Pfister), Best Editing (Lee Smith), Best Art Direction(Nathan Crowley and Peter Lando), Best Sound Mixing (Lora Hirschberg, Gary Rizzo, and Ed Novick),Best Sound Editing (Richard King), Best Visual Effects (Nick Davis, Chris Corbould, Timothy Webber, and Paul J. Franklin),Best Makeup (John Caglione Jr. and Conor O’Sullivan)Golden Tomato Awards: Best Action AdventureOther Major Awards: Golden Globes, Best Supporting Actor (Ledger); BAFTA, Best Supporting Actor (Ledger); Screen Actors Guild, Best Supporting Actor (Ledger), Best Stunt Ensemble; Grammy, Best Motion Picture Score (James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer)Ok, so The Dark Knight didn’t get nominated for best picture. Still, fanboys and girls can take comfort in the fact the Academy bestowed eight nominations on Christopher Nolan’s critically acclaimed box-office triumph. Clearly, Ledger’s outstanding work as the Joker is the sentimental favorite this year.The Class (96% )Oscar Nomination: Best Foreign FilmOther Major Awards: NoneAfter netting the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2008, The Class, a French film chronicling one teacher’s experiences at a middle school in Paris, was overlooked by virtually everyone else. With its Oscar nod and a nomination in the Independent Spirit Awards, however, it may finally get its due.Waltz with Bashir (96% )Oscar Nomination: Best Foreign FilmOther Major Awards: Golden Globe, Best Foreign Film; Writers Guild of America, Best Documentary ScreenplayThis hallucinatory mix of animation and documentary recounts the horrors of the 1982 Lebanon War. It’s the first animated foreign language film to receive both Oscar and Golden Globe recognition, and was a staple of critics’ top-ten lists for 2008.WALL-E (96% )Oscar Nominations (6): Best Animated Feature, Best Original Screenplay(Andrew Stanton, Jim Reardon, and Pete Docter), Best Sound Editing (Ben Burtt and Matthew Wood), Best Sound Mixing (Burtt, Michael Semanick, and Tom Myers), Best Score (Thomas Newman), Best Original Song (“Down to Earth”)Golden Tomato Awards: Best Wide Release, Best AnimationOther Major Awards: Golden Globes, Best Animated Feature; BAFTA, Best Animated Film, BAFTA Children’s Award for Best Feature Film; Producers Guild of America, Best Animated Feature; Grammy, Best Song for a Motion Picture; American Cinema Editors, Best Edited Feature Film, Comedy or MusicalOne of 2008’s best-reviewed films, WALL-E looks to continue Pixar’s dominance of the Academy’s Best Animated Feature category. In addition, the Academy couldn’t ignore its evocative use of sound, which helped to establish atmosphere in the film’s nearly dialogue-free first half.Trouble the Water (97% )Oscar Nomination: Best DocumentaryOther Major Awards: NoneIn chronicling a couple’s attempt to survive Hurricane Katrina, Trouble the Water finds inspiration in an almost unfathomably sad moment in American history. This critically-acclaimed documentary utilizes footage from a variety of sources, none as powerful as what Ninth Ward survivor Kimberly Rivers Roberts captured on her video camera as the storm hit.The Wrestler (98% )Golden Tomato Awards: Best DramaOscar Nominations (2): Best Actor (Mickey Rourke), Best Supporting Actress(Marisa Tomei)Other Major Awards: BAFTA, Best Leading Actor (Rourke); Golden Globe, Best Original Song (Bruce Springsteen, “The Wrestler”)Mickey Rourke’s stunning turn as washed-up ring king Randy “The Ram” Robinson has generated plenty of acclaim, as has Marisa Tomei’s performance as a stripper looking for an exit. (Both of them are up for Indie Spirit Awards, as is director Darren Aronofsky.) Some Oscar watchers were surprised that the Academy snubbed Bruce Springsteen’s title tune for Best Original Song.Man on Wire (100% )Oscar Nomination: Best DocumentaryGolden Tomato Awards: Best Limited Release, Best Documentary, Best UK ReleaseOther Major Awards: BAFTA, Outstanding British Film; American Cinema Editors, Best Edited Documentary (Jinx Godfrey)Man On Wire is the best-reviewed Oscar-nominated film in any category, and has picked up a respectable amount awards season hardware. Not bad for a documentary about a guy who thought it would be a good idea to tightrope-walk the World Trade Center.Be sure to check out the rest of our various Awards coverage on the fabulous Awards Tour page, HERE.Also, don’t forget to read up on recent installments of Total Recall, including Hollywood’s most famous on-and-off-screen couples, Steve Martin’s best movies, and the Best Football-Playing Actors.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Film, Peek, league, USA, APB, Family","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-We-Rank-The-Oscar-Nominees"},{"id":"47508993173139","title":"Total Recall: James Bond Countdown — Find Out Where Quantum of Solace Fits In!","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Indy fans have been waiting for almost 20 years for this sequel, even though from time to time it looked like it was never going to happen. This week’s Total Recall takes a look at the top 20 sequels that were at one time announced and planned (or even just rumored) but for some reason or another have yet to actually go into production.more info…20. Flash Gordon 2The Set-Up: At the end of the Queen-scored, flamboyantly campy 1980 space opera Flash Gordon, a gloved hand picks up Ming’s power ring, we hear Ming laugh, and the screen says, “The End?”The History: Considering how Star Wars pretty much re-invented science fiction adventure, bringing back Flash Gordon from his serial picture past might have made sense, but a sequel to this expensive flop ($27 million U.S. from a $35 million budget) did not.The Future: Twenty-six years later, today’s audience barely remembers the 1980 movie, so it makes sense that this week, Sony announced that they had won a bidding war to bring the franchise back to theaters in a new project that won’t be a sequel.Pathetic Earthlings… who will play Ming now?more info…19. Buckaroo Banzai vs. The World Crime LeagueThe Set-Up: In 1984, there was a strange little science-fiction comedy called The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, about a genius scientist who had adventures with his group of sidekicks who supported him in his night job as a rock star. The end of the movie included a title card for a sequel.The History: Buckaroo Banzai was one of those movies that was helped greatly in becoming a cult classic by coming out in the midst of the VCR explosion of the 1980s, but it didn’t actually make that much real money, no matter how many times people rented it. Hence, no real, firm sequel plans ever happened besides that ending.The Future: We may never see Peter Weller or anyone else play Buckaroo again, but the movie’s original writers started a comic book series for the character last year.Still waiting for the Hong Kong Cavaliers reunion tour…more info…18. History of the World: Part IIThe Set-Up: The ending of Mel Brooks’ The History of the World Part I includes teasers of scenes from a sequel that would supposedly include chapters like “A Viking Funeral”, “Hitler on Ice,” and “Jews in Space.”The History: It turns out those gags were just that: jokes to end the first movie, with no plans by Mel Brooks to ever actually make a sequel. The shame there is that The History of the World Part I is arguably Brooks’ last great comedy (depending upon what you think of his Dracula and Robin Hood spoofs, I suppose).The Future: With The Producers and Young Frankenstein both being hits on Broadway, we can always hope that History of the World might someday hit the Great White Way, but Spaceballs is probably as close as we’ll ever get to seeing movie featuring Jews in Space.more info…17. JinxThe Set-Up: Halle Berry costarred in Die Another Day, as a sort of female African-American counterpart to James Bond, and once people saw her in that bikini, they wanted a whole movie of more of the same.The History: Halle Berry and MGM wanted more of the same too, and they’d been hoping for a James Bond spin-off for years. The actress talked up plans for a Jinx movie for quite a while as she did press appearances in the next year or two, but although MGM did briefly pencil in Jinx on their long-term schedule, very little actual development had ever been done, and the studio eventually dropped their plans altogether.The Future: When Daniel Craig took over as Bond, the franchise underwent a sort of reboot, which could theoretically mean Giacinta “Jinx” Johnson is now as much a part of the James Bond movie past as Oddjob, Jaws, Pussy Galore and Ernst Blofeld.This would have been soooo much better than Catwoman.more info…16. Roger Rabbit II: Toon PlatoonThe Set-Up: In 1988, Disney Pictures released Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, an ambitious mix of live action and cartoon characters from most of the major “talking animals” stables. Audiences loved it, and it seemed like an obvious new franchise.The History: At least two separate attempts were made by writers for Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Pictures to write a prequel, the first of which in 1992 was subtitled Toon Platoon, and would have depicted Roger’s adventures as a soldier in a cartoon war, accompanied by some of classic animation’s favorite characters.The Future: The Roger Rabbit franchise has tried to make some comebacks, but the problem is that much of the allure of the movie was not necessarily the character itself, but the way that the movie created a credible world combining so many separate characters. Such a corporate marriage with so many partners is unlikely to ever happen again.Can I have a sequel Eddie? P-p-p-p-p-please?more info…15. The Vega BrothersThe Set-Up: Sometime after Pulp Fiction was released, Quentin Tarantino revealed that Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) from Reservoir Dogs and Vincent (John Travolta) from Pulp Fiction were actually brothers, and that he had plans for a Vega Brothers movie that would the two actors would star in, as the brotherly gangster duo.The History: Another 10 years went by, Tarantino occasionally mentioned The Vega Brothers when asked about future projects, and then in 2007, he announced that he had abandoned the project entirely.The Future: We may yet see either Michael Madsen reunite with Quentin Tarantino again if he ever gets his World War II project, Inglorious Bastards, going. As for The Vega Brothers, some writers (including this one) have speculated that we may have gotten as close a version of them we’re likely to ever get from QT, in the form of the criminal brothers Tarantino and George Clooney played in From Dusk Till Dawn.Vincent and Victor Vegamore info…14. Beverly Hills Cop 4The Set-Up: In 1984, Beverly Hills Cop was the perfect vehicle to help Eddie Murphy continue his transition from being a popular SNL cast member and notoriously vulgar standup comedian. The blockbuster hit was followed by two sequels, with Beverly Hills III in 1994 flopping miserably, with just $46 million domestically.The History: Despite the third film’s poor reception, producer Jerry Bruckheimer continued to keep some sort of Beverly Hills Cop IV in development for the next decade, but he eventually gave up, with the rights being picked up by Lorenzo di Bonaventura, who announced his new plans in 2006. Several screenwriters have since been hired to work on the project.The Future: A fourth film now seems likely, in a revival that would very much mirror the returns of other 1980s action stars like John McClane, Rambo and Indiana Jones. The question for now is whether Eddie Murphy wants to stop making goofy comedies like Meet Dave and Norbit and get back to the more adult fare that made him a star.Foley and Rosewood… together again!more info…13. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon prequel or sequelThe Set-Up: As Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon swept the world, introducing mainstream audiences to Chinese Wuxia fantasy, much press was given to the fact that it was actually an adaptation of the fourth part of The Crane-Iron Pentalogy, potentially leaving three prequels and a sequel ready for adaptation next, with word that director Ang Lee was open to the idea.The History: Ang Lee continued to talk about the prospect of returning to this possible Wuxia franchise as recently as the late 2005 publicity for Brokeback Mountain, but around the same time, the producer of the first movie was quoted as saying that plans for a CTHD prequel had been scrapped.The Future: Chinese and Hong Kong films exist outside of Hollywood, very definitively, with their own rules. In other words, if the will exists to continue making Crane-Iron movies, someone over there will get it done, quite possibly separate from what Ang Lee did with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Will we ever see the other four chapters?more info…12. Forrest Gump 2: Gump &amp; Co.The Set-Up: Based on a satirical novel, Forrest Gump was ridiculously successful for a movie of its type, propelling Tom Hanks even further into superstellar orbit. In 1995, a year after the film’s release, author Winston Groom wrote a sequel called Gump &amp; Co. which basically continued Gump’s adventures farther into the 1980s and the 1990s, including an encounter with a famous actor named Tom Hanks.The History: Gump &amp; Co. was likewise picked up for movie rights, but not much seemed to be done with it until 2007, with the first movie’s screenwriter, Eric Roth, hired to adapt.The Future: I’ve read both books, so I can tell you fairly straightforwardly that the problem with following up Forrest Gump with Gump &amp; Co. is that the sequel book… SUCKED. Having said that, the concept does benefit from another 10+ years for us to start to feel more real nostalgia for the 1980s and 1990s, since nostalgia is Gump‘s real raison d’etre.Will Forrest get another box of chocolates?more info…11. Austin Powers 4The Set-Up: In 1997, Mike Myers found his first huge comedy hit with Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, which inspired two sequels, each of which was even more successful than the one before it. Then, silence.The History: Myers has been talking about Austin Powers 4 to anyone who asks him pretty much since the last movie came out in 2002, with plans for the 4th film to focus on Dr. Evil as a main character, and Austin more as a supporting (heroic) foil. Part of the delay may have something to do with the 5 year gap between his last live-action movie (The Cat in the Hat) and this summer’s The Love Guru (not counting his animated success with the Shrek movies).The Future: Mike Myers continues to talk about Austin Powers 4, but thus far, there’s no firm evidence of the status of the script, nor a deal for director Jay Roach to return. The franchise’s future is also not particularly helped by the demise of New Line Cinema. When Mike Myers really wants to make the movie however, Hollywood will probably still jump.Swinging 80s here I come, baby!more info…10. Men in Black 3The Set-Up: Men in Black grossed over $250 million domestically in 1997. Men in Black II grossed $190 million in 2002. Another movie seemed a no-brainer.The History: Surprisingly, not much actual development ever seemed to have been done on continuing this profitable sci-fi comedy franchise. Occasionally, someone would ask Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones about it, and they’d express interest, but a quote on a red carpet, a script does not make.The Future: In 2005, the two producers who aren’t Steven Spielberg announced plans to develop a third Men in Black movie, but expressed interest in going in a lower budget direction, in an attempt to return the concept to its roots, and not necessarily try to top it in flashy CGI F/X (like the second movie did). The question now is how low-budget we’re talking. Might they really mean taking the franchise to direct-to-video?The Men in Black may never come back.more info…9. Chronicles of Riddick 3The Set-Up: Director David Twohy’s Pitch Black in 2000 featured a prison escapee character named Riddick played by Vin Diesel. People loved Riddick, and so in 2004, the duo returned with The Chronicles of Riddick, which was promised to be the first of a new trilogy of science fiction epics.The History: Unfortunately, The Chronicles of Riddick only grossed domestically about half of its $105+ million budget, which apparently put Universal’s plans to continue the trilogy somewhere behind the back burner.The Future: Vin Diesel and David Twohy continue to talk up their plans to continue the trilogy, however, although Twohy was quoted as saying that he expects Universal will no longer be involved, and that the sequels will return to the character’s Pitch Black roots, as lower budget, independent productions.Riddick may return… someday.more info…8. Independence Day 2The Set-Up: Independence Day was the first movie to gross over $50 million in an opening weekend (and over $95 million over a 5-day holiday weekend), and grossed over $300 million domestically, making it easily the #1 movie of 1996. The movie ended optimistically, but most moviegoers expected at the time that a movie that successful just had to have a sequel coming.The History: Surprisingly, director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin didn’t immediately sieze upon working on an Independence Day sequel, and instead worked on other humongous and bombastic productions like the Godzilla remake and The Day After Tomorrow. They were quoted after 9/11/01 as saying that the world’s reaction to that tragedy made them consider a sequel, but after a few meetings, they gave up on the project.The Future: Director Roland Emmerich may not make another Independence Day movie, but his movies since then show a commitment to making big-budget apocalypse movies of a similar stripe which might be called thematically sequelistic. Next up is 2012, which is expected to have to do with the Mayan calendar’s prediction of the end of the world.Chances are the fat lady already sang.more info…7. Alien 5The Set-Up: Alien was a science fiction and horror masterpiece, and launched the career of director Ridley Scott. Three sequels followed, with the fourth entry ending with Ripley and her alien-infested ship crashing onto Earth.The History: Alien: Resurrection, the fourth movie, released in 1997, only grossed $45+ million domestically, much less than its $75 million budget. Nevertheless, 20th Century Fox spent nearly the next decade trying to get a 5th movie going. Arguably, a 5th movie was eventually produced in the form of Alien vs Predator.The Future: At this point, the Alien franchise as a stand-alone entity appears to be pretty much dead. Both Ridley Scott (Alien) and James Cameron (Aliens) have been quoted over the years as being potentially interested in doing another one, but there is nothing current going on to suggest any such plans will see fruition.We probably won’t see anymore Ripley.more info…6. Mad Max IV: Fury RoadThe Set-Up: Starting as an ultra-low-budget Australian apocalyptic thriller flick, Mad Max was arguably the most unlikely of “blockbuster” trilogies, launching the film career of Mel Gibson. After the Tina Turner-starring Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome in 1985, however, the story seemed done.The History: However, director George Miller (the original movies, and producer of Babe) started expressing interest in doing a fourth movie, inspired by a script he had received called Fury Road. Mel Gibson was reportedly in advanced talks to return as Max, but Gibson’s own plans kept him busy (namely, The Passion of the Christ).The Future: With the Justice League movie shelved, director George Miller has been talking to lots of press in the last few months, with much indication being made that he hopes to restart Mad Max IV: Fury Road, although this time, he may be going with a younger actor to star.Maybe Max will finally hit the road again.more info…5. Jurassic Park IVThe Set-Up: The first three Jurassic Park movies grossed altogether over $750 million in domestic box office alone, so a fourth entry in the “attacking dinosaurs” series seemed likely.The History: Not long after the 2001 release of Jurassic Park III, there was much continued talk about a possible 4th movie, with rumors appearing online regularly about what the story might entail, who might return, etc.The Future: This is one of those projects that always seems to be speculated as going into production for a summer release in the following year, and yet it never quite gets there. That is the current status of Jurassic Park IV: there are rumors of a 2008 filming start date, but nothing official from Universal Pictures.Indiana Jones and the Cloned Velociraptorsmore info…4. Tron 2.0The Set-Up: Disney’s 1982 science fiction epic, Tron, broke amazing new visual ground for its time, and smartly tied itself to a very cool arcade game, right in the middle of the first great videogame boom of the early 1980s. The concept seemed perpetually sequel-worthy, but the videogame bust followed soon after, and American interest in video games faded.The History: Fading videogame interest in the 80s didn’t stop the concept of a Tron sequel from seeming like a pretty awesome idea 20 years later, as video games bounced back from that slump to become an industry that makes more money in a year than Hollywood does in movies. A script called Tron 2.0 was pitched to Disney, but was ultimately adapted as a videogame of that title instead.The Future: In 2005, Disney announced plans to indeed return to Tron, in what was first described as a remake, and then in 2007, when two of the writers of Lost (Eddie Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, famous for writing most of the “Hurley” episodes) were brought aboard, was redefined as “the next chapter” in the franchise.Everyone wants more lightcycles.more info…3. King Conan: Crown of IronThe Set-Up: Screenwriter John Milius (Apocalypse Now and several gritty westerns) entered the fantasy realm with his two movie adaptations of Robert E. Howard’s Conan character, at the same time making an Austrian bodybuilder not just a movie star, but arguably the definitive action star of the 1980s.The History: Many years after Arnold Schwarzenegger had become even more famous doing lots of other movies, Milius came up with the idea for King Conan: Crown of Iron, a script inspired by Howard’s stories of Conan as the conqueror king of Aquilonia, which would star Schwarzenegger once again, this time as an older, wiser, but still badass and avenging Conan. The timing for the project also happened to be around the time Arnold got elected governor of California.The Future: The idea of future Conan movies endures past Schwarzenegger and Milius’ involvement in adapting the R.E.H. character, as Millenium Films picked up the rights to the character in 2007, and hopes to start production this year, on a project that would now benefit from being tied to the very successful (1 million beta testers), recently launched MMO computer game, Age of Conan.Conan may still have some fight in him yet.more info…2. Ghostbusters IIIThe Set-Up: Ghostbusters grossed $230 million, making it the #2 movie of 1984, and oh yeah, it was also a comic masterpiece, worthy of the Oscar for comedies, if there was such a thing. Ghostbusters II premiered in 1989 to what was at that time the largest ever opening three day weekend ($29+ million).The History: Columbia/Sony has been wanting to make a third Ghostbusters movie for nearly 20 years now, but the “main guys” (particularly, Bill Murray, reportedly) were never 100% excited about having made the second movie, much less a third movie. Dan Aykroyd, however, has remained interested over the years, and worked on a script that would have sent the Ghostbusters to Hell, as a version of New York City.The Future: Ghostbusters: The Videogame is due out in late 2008, and according to Aykroyd (talking to Total Film Magazine), “This [the game] is essentially the third movie”, since it uses the major plot points from what would have been the third game’s script, and all of the original cast except Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis are returning as voice cast. Given how much money video games are making compared to Hollywood movies, this idea of Ghostbusters III taking on a video game form instead might be the start of a new trend.They’re still ready to believe you.more info…1. Star Wars: Episodes 7, 8, and 9The Set-Up: : Back in the late 1970s, George Lucas was quoted as saying that Star Wars was envisioned ultimately as a trilogy of trilogies, with those first three movies being the sequels, to be followed by a prequel trilogy and a sequel trilogy. Obviously, we got the first one, but whatever happened to the second?The History: By the time he started actually making the prequel trilogy, George Lucas attempted to do some backpedalling about his statements about a sequel trilogy.The Future: Much to everyone’s chagrin, Lucas now maintains that the sequel trilogy is not in the works, but I think we all know that you can never say never… In the meantime, there are two television projects in the works, with the animated series getting launched this summer first with Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and a live-action series expected to start production in 2009, to start airing in 2010, and to be set in the era in between the prequel trilogy and the classic Star Wars films.Mark Hamill can’t be that busy, can he?","section":"Total Recall","tags":"reboot, biography, Fox, critic, Dark, CBS","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-20-Sequels-Were-Still-Waiting-For"},{"id":"47508994718368","title":"Total Recall: Our Favorite Conspiracies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Our Favorite ConspiraciesThe truth is, uh, out there.by Ryan Fujitani and Tim Ryan | July 23, 2008 |  CommentsAh, conspiracy theories — they’re as American as mom and apple pie. Our fascination with shadowy sects and secret, nefarious schemes has inspired countless books, television shows, and, yes, movies — and in honor of the long-awaited arrival of the conspiracy-rich X-Files: I Want to Believe, we’ve compiled a like-minded list for this week’s Total Recall.So, what’s your favorite brand of conspiracy? Government manipulation of the press? The military-industrial complex? Secret surveillance? Aliens? Assassinations? How about the Freemasons? We’ve got ’em all — and more. Put on your tinfoil hats and draw the shades, and follow us down the dark (but oh so entertaining) trail of conspiracies at the movies.more info…&nbsp;Assassinations!&nbsp;Exhibit A:JFK(1991, 83 percent on the Tomatometer)&nbsp;Oliver Stone had been making movies for years before JFK was released in 1991, but for better or worse, it’s the film that many filmgoers will always think of when they hear the director’s name. And for good reason: Stone’s 189-minute dissertation reinforced our deep national fondness for conspiracy theories, building a case against the Warren Report’s conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone when he assassinated John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. Critics responded to the screenplay and a cast stacked with famous faces (Kevin Costner, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, and John Candy, to name just a few), while everyone else did what they always do with a good Oliver Stone movie: argue about it. The film’s historical accuracy was hotly debated, insults were hurled, and all the while, it kept making money, finally topping out over $200 million in worldwide box office. Well played, Mr. Stone.Exhibits B and C: The Day of the Jackal, Arlington Road&nbsp;more info…&nbsp;Brainwashing!&nbsp;Exhibit A:The Parallax View(1974, 91 percent)If the movies are any indication, the 1970s were a time of widespread paranoia. Art imitates life, after all, and Watergate was grist for many a filmmaker’s mill — the idea that our government was engaged in dark machinations was brought to the fore in the Nixon era. The Parallax View is loaded with conspiracies: reporter Joe Frady (Warren Beatty) is present when a presidential candidate is assassinated at the Space Needle in Seattle, and discovers that other witnesses to the slaying have been murdered. After some digging, Frady obtains evidence that the sinister Parallax Corporation may be behind the murders, and is recruiting (and subsequently brainwashing) individuals to carry out further assassinations. Cynical and haunting, The Parallax View is an apt summary of the paranoid ethos of 1970s thriller filmmaking.Exhibits B and C: The Manchurian Candidate, Conspiracy Theorymore info…Corporate Control&nbsp;Exhibit A:The President’s Analyst(1967, 81 percent)In this Cold War farce, psychiatrist Sidney Schaefer (James Coburn) is just trying to do what he thought was his patriotic duty: let the president unload all his problems. Soon, however, the analyst knows too much, and the CIA, the Soviets, and a bevy of agencies are all hot on his trail. What is behind this fiendish plot? The Phone Company. Yes, the same people who once encouraged you to reach out and touch someone are planning to enslave the human race. The President’s Analyst may be a little dated in spots, but its message — that huge corporations are pulling the strings of governments around the globe — still resonates, and is delivered with some sharp laughs.Exhibits B and C: The Constant Gardener, Michael Claytonmore info…Government Manipulation of Facts!&nbsp;Exhibit A:Wag the Dog(1997, 84 percent)An American president is accused of sexual misconduct in the Oval Office, and the resultant public-relations firestorm is blunted by a series of conveniently timed military attacks that distract the press corps and whip the country into a patriotic fervor. This Barry Levinson-directed satire was based on a book inspired by the Persian Gulf war of George H.W. Bush‘s presidency, but its release came just months before the Monica Lewinsky scandal engulfed the Clinton administration — a scandal that, wouldn’t you know it, came with its own series of conveniently timed military attacks. Even for a country inured to the art of spin (and counter-spin), the convergence of news and entertainment was a little uncomfortable, but that didn’t stop critics from praising the film’s fine performances (including strong performances from Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman) and sublime touches (a war anthem by Willie Nelson? Perfect).Exhibits B and C: Medium Cool, Bob Robertsmore info…The Illumnati. And the Freemasons!Exhibit A:National Treasure(2004, 43 percent)Critics may have neglected to certify this Jerry Bruckheimer-produced action flick Fresh, but few of them argued against its worth as a source of simple-minded fun — and as a bonus, folks who ponied up for a ticket were treated not only to a mullet-free performance from Nicolas Cage, but a plot that rested on two of the all-time favorite conspiracy sources: the Knights Templar and the Freemasons. Historians shook their heads and clucked their tongues at the inaccuracies and far-fetched twists that found Cage’s treasure-seeking protagonist decoding messages on the back of the Declaration of Independence and digging Ben Franklin’s super-secret spectacles out of a Philadelphia landmark, but the storyline’s plethora of centuries-old secrets appealed to the swashbuckling kids in us all, sending National Treasure to nearly $350 million in worldwide grosses and sparking a franchise that has already spawned one sequel and a line of books. Something tells us we’ll be seeing Cage solve a few more ancient riddles before he’s through.Exhibits B and C: Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, From Hellmore info…The Military Industrial Complex!Exhibit A:Seven Days in May(1964, 100 percent)When President Lyman Jordan (Fredric March) signs a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, Air Force General James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster) isn’t happy. At all. In fact, he sets into motion a plot to overthrow the U.S. government and take control of the nation’s mass media. It’s clear Scott is an uber-hawk, but maybe he’s also concerned that the end of the Cold War will put him out of a job. One thing’s for sure: Dwight Eisenhower could have been referring to him when he warned the nation of the military-industrial complex. Scott’s conspiracy certainly doesn’t pay much mind to the Constitution or the military’s civilian rule.Exhibits B and C: Why We Fightmore info…Spies!Exhibit A:The 39 Steps(1939, 96 percent)Alfred Hitchcock was particularly fond of a plot that involved an innocent man on the run from the authorities and agents of intrigue; he utilized it for such classics as Saboteur and North By Northwest. One of the master’s earliest thrillers in this vein was The 39 Steps, starring Robert Donat as Richard Hannay, a man who witnesses a shooting in a theater and is hustled back to the apartment of a beautiful woman who is also a spy. Later that night, she’s stabbed, and all signs point to Hannay, who’s pursued by the cops — and later, the 39 Steps, an organization of spies gathering intel for a foreign government. Hitchcock devises some fantastic set pieces (Hannay pulls off several narrow escapes) while weaving a convoluted plot that sates the audience’s hunger for spy conspiracies, no matter how vague.Exhibits B and C: Three Days of the Condor,The Bourne Identitymore info…Suppression of Upstart Political Movements!Exhibit A:Z(1969, 89 percent)&nbsp;This riveting political thriller is loosely based on the true story of the 1963 assassination of Greek left-wing politician Gregoris Lambrakis, whose killing was linked to far-right extremists and their protectors within the police department. In Z, an upstart activist (Yves Montand) is killed in a suspicious accident after delivering a speech, and a young magistrate (Jean-Louis Trintignant) investigates the circumstances of his death. After being stonewalled at virtually every turn, however, he finds evidence that implicates the police in the murder — and becomes a target himself. Costa Gavras‘ film is an angry (and action-packed) reminder that some governments will stop at nothing to cling to power.Exhibits B and C: Lumumba, The Battle of Algiersmore info…Surveillance!&nbsp;Exhibit A:Sneakers(1992, 81 percent)&nbsp;It’s over two hours long and it has an impossibly convoluted plot, which helps explain why a movie starring Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, Ben Kingsley, James Earl Jones, Sidney Poitier, and River Phoenix failed to generate much box-office heat when it was released. But the film’s themes — government surveillance and espionage for espionage’s sake — are timeless, and Sneakers has become something of a cult classic since drifting in and out of theaters in 1992. The storyline is really too complicated to do justice here, but it basically boils down to Redford and Kingsley battling over a black box that has attracted the attention of the NSA — in other words, just the sort of scenery-chewing stuff that’s perfect for the old pros in this cast to have a field day with. Tech-fueled espionage flicks reached their apex in the Cold War 1980s, and they really don’t make ’em like this anymore — but if the current remake craze continues long enough, they’ll have to get around to “updating” Sneakers at some point, right?Exhibits B and C: The Conversation, The Lives of Othersmore info…UFOs!&nbsp;Exhibit A:Men in Black(1997, 90 percent)Catching Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones at their late-1990s apexes, Barry Sonnenfeld‘s adaptation of the Lowell Black comic book series wedded the zeitgeist to a time-honored American fascination — namely, UFOs and the mysterious figures who try to keep us from finding out about them — and earned nearly $600 million in worldwide box office for its trouble. The sequel wasn’t as much fun, but that’s pretty much a given when you’re talking about something as effortlessly cool and funny as Men in Black — from Smith and Jones’ terrific rapport to Rick Baker’s typically excellent special effects, it was the perfect summer blockbuster for its time. In retrospect, it’s interesting to imagine how differently MiB could have turned out — Jones refused to sign on until producer Steven Spielberg promised the script would improve, and Smith only got the part of James Edwards, a.k.a. Agent J, after it was rejected by Chris O’Donnell and David Schwimmer.Exhibits B and C: Independence Day, X-Files: Fight the FutureCheck out past editions of Total Recall in our column archives.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"America, Guide, drama, Pet, John, Tubi, Studios","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"total-recall-our-favorite-conspiracies"},{"id":"47508994729636","title":"Total Recall: The Best of Stan Winston","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: The Best of Stan WinstonWe take a look back at the celebrated career of Hollywood's beloved creature artist.by Tim Ryan | June 18, 2008 |  CommentsWith the passing of Oscar-winning makeup and special effects artist Stan Winston, RT decided to take a closer look at one of Hollywood’s most innovative and influential behind-the-scenes figures, a man whose work changed the way that the movie industry brought special effects magic to the screen.Stan Winston is proof, if any were needed, that dedicated, inspired craftspeople can leave as indelible a mark on movies — and audiences — as any director or actor. In his four-decade career, Winston’s work was consistently inventive. He won an Emmy for his makeup work on the TV adaptation of The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pitman, aging Cecily Tyson 19 to 110. More recently, he helped bring Iron Man to exhilarating, vivid life. But Winston was no mere craftsman; as he once said, “I don’t do special effects. I do characters. I do creatures.” This week’s Total Recall takes stock of some of Winston’s most memorable cinematic creations, many of which have left a profound mark on the imagination.more info…The Terminator (1984, 100 percent)Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991, 97 percent)The first two Terminator films are perhaps the best examples of how Winston’s work changed with the times — and influenced cinematic technology to come. On the low-budget Terminator, Winston crafted the machine’s exoskeleton with puppetry and animatronics. He would use similar applications on T2, but with greater complexity, and combined with the molten, shape shifting CGI, the sequel was huge leap forward for special effects (he won two Oscars for the film, for Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup). The Terminator began a fruitful partnership with James Cameron; they would work together on several more projects, and co-founded Digital Domain, a cutting edge digital effects company. He also remained close to Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has referred to Winston in recent obituaries as “one of my best friends.”more info…Aliens (1986, 100 percent)Taking over the helm of the Alien franchise, James Cameron brought Winston with him. They had their work cut out for them; how do you improve on Ridley Scott’s taut, nightmarish direction and H.R. Geiger’s iconic creature? The answer: go bigger and badder. While Cameron pumped up the action, Winston created a truly terrifying expansion on the original creature: the giant alien queen, a 14-foot tall combination of frightening power and dizzying speed. Supported by a crane, and utilizing a complex system of hydraulics, cables, a pair of puppeteers brought the menacing queen to life, and, in doing so, helped to deepen the legacy of one of horror and sci-fi cinema’s most memorable monsters and picking up an Oscar for Best Visual Effects.“The special-effects specialists are featured prominently in the credits that precede Aliens, and so they should be,” wrote Walther Goodman of the New York Times. “Under the direction of James Cameron, they have put together a flaming, flashing, crashing, crackling blow-’em-up show.”more info…The Monster Squad (1987, 53 percent)In addition to his proclivity for blood and guts, Winston made a few forays into kid-friendly territory, creating effects for Mouse Hunt and directing the Anthony Michael Hall-toplined The Adventures of a Gnome Named Gnorm. In the cult fave The Monster Squad, Winston introduced some classic cinematic creeps to a new generation. The plot involves a group of pre-teen outcasts who revel in monster movies — and become the world’s only hope when some of their supposed favorites (including Dracula, the Mummy, Frankenstein’s monster, and the Wolf Man) start wrecking havoc. Praising Winston’s work, Filmcritic.com‘s Keith Breese wrote, “The Monster Squad combines goofy humor with real scares and genuine mystery.”more info…Predator (1987, 78 percent)In creating the Predator, Winston was inspired by a conversation with James Cameron, during which the director said he always wanted to see a creature with mandibles. Winston labored on the design, and after several false starts (including a halt in production to get the creature just right), he emerged with yet another terrifying monster. Inhabited by 7-foot actor and mime Kevin Peter Hall, the Predator suit made for one of the least friendly — and most uniquely grotesque — extraterrestrials in movie history. And as arduous as the process was, Winston picked up an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects. (As for the movie itself, it features two future governors!)“The special effects have dated quite well, and the action scenes — shot by relative newcomer John McTiernan — work well, despite a few clunky spots,” wrote Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustible Celluloid.more info…Pumpkinhead (1988, 53 percent)Winston’s directorial debut tells the spooky tale of a father who, after summoning the titular demon to enact revenge against those who killed his son, learns there’s a price to be paid for his actions. Set in the Appalachian Mountains, Winston’s film blends the supernatural with fairy tales, and his bony, raptor-like creature is the stuff of nightmares. Given his duties as director, Winston delegated much of the special-effects work to others; nonetheless, he crafted a creepy morality tale whose cult has only increased with time. Rob Vaux of Flipside Movie Emporium called it “satisfying B-movie fun from effects maestro Stan Winston.”more info…Leviathan (1989, 11 percent)Even on the most middling of projects, Winston proved to be an inventive craftsman. Case in point: Leviathan, which was panned by critics for its hackneyed underwater monster-movie plot. Still, Winston labored to create a unique creature; pouring over medical books and photos of deep-sea life, he designed a baddie that fused human, octopus, lamprey, and eel characteristics. Andreas Samuelson of Slasherpool called it “forgettable and predictable, but with a good cast and some fun special effects.”more info…Edward Scissorhands (1990, 90 percent)Winston and director Tim Burton shared a taste for the macabre, so it’s little wonder the pair worked together on several films (Winston was the special effects director on Big Fish and handled the makeup on the Penguin in Batman Returns). However, it was one of Burton’s most personal projects, Edward Scissorhands, that may be the acme of their collaboration. Winston transformed Johnny Depp into one of cinema’s most poignant outcasts, and got an Oscar nomination for Best Makeup in the process.With his pale, scarred visage, haunted eyes, and unkempt hair, “Depp is tender, affecting and, quite frankly, bloody pretty,” wrote Desson Thomson of the Washington Post.more info…Jurassic Park (1993, 86 percent)Critics had plenty of bones to pick with the plot of Jurassic Park. However, virtually no one complained about the dinosaurs — least of all audiences, who were dazzled by the film’s technical marvels. Steven Spielberg used a number of state-of-the-art methods to bring his prehistoric terrors to life, from go-motion to groundbreaking CGI. Winston was called in to create animatronic dinosaurs, and the result was uncanny. Winston received yet another Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and would be nominated again for 1997’s The Lost World. “If they didn’t look real, if you didn’t believe their skin, their flesh, their reality… no matter how good the performances were, it wouldn’t be real,” Winston said in The Making of Jurassic Park.On that count, Winston and his crew succeeded wildly: “Jurassic Park does for live-action critters what Who Framed Roger Rabbit did for toons,” wrote Rita Kemply of the Washington Post. “In that sense, it’s a cinematic landmark.”more info…Congo (1995, 20 percent)After the revolutionary CGI/animatronics of Jurassic Park, Winston used models and puppetry for another Michael Crichton adaptation, the ape-gone-ape flick Congo (since director Frank Marshall didn’t think computers could accurately duplicate the beasts’ fur). The film fared poorly with critics (“This glib, overheated film about vicious primates delivers little suspense,” wrote Janet Maslin of the New York Times), and fanboys were disappointed with the lack of digital razzle dazzle.However, Congo was an important film for Winston, who said his work on the movie was a learning process: “The next thing that I did was a movie called Instinct with Anthony Hopkins, which I think was the best gorillas I’ve ever scene on film, and I could never have done that movie if I had not made mistakes on Congo.”more info…A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001, 72 percent)In his TV days, Winston was the makeup artist for a version of Pinocchio. So it wasn’t much of a stretch when, working on Steven Spielberg’s A.I., he was tasked with crafting animatronics that would make artificial humans as lifelike as possible. The result were a number of puppets that bridged the uncanny valley, as well as Teddy, a super toy that required five crew members to aid it in its movements. Winston’s work on the film impressed MIT scientists and the Academy, garnering his last Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects. Critics found the film flawed but worthy, especially on a technical level; Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune called A.I “a provocative, personal and intensely engaging picture made with big-studio resources and technical magic.”more info…Iron Man (2008, 93 percent)When the adaptation of Iron Man was first announced, Marvel Comics fans eagerly anticipated the design of Tony Stark’s super suit. Winston, a big fan of the original comics, was tasked with the job, and he delivered, creating rubber and metal versions of the Iron Man suits, as well as an eight-foot, 800-lb. animatronic version of Stark’s nemesis, Iron Monger. Though Winston’s untimely passing is deeply sad, he went out on top of his game; Iron Man is the best-reviewed wide release of 2008 so far.“[Director Jon] Favreau has turned what might have been just another comic strip formulation into a completely engaging amalgam of storytelling, romance, performance, acrobatics and organically motivated effects,” wrote Jules Brenner of Cinema Signals.Winston’s credits by no means end there. His effects work also includes End of Days and Galaxy Quest, and The Wiz, The Thing,Friday the 13th Part III, and Constantine partially comprise his makeup contributions. He was also working on two forthcoming films at the time of his death: Speed Demon and Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins.Here’s a clip from one of Winston’s earliest efforts, the made-for-TV film Gargoyles:And, finally, here’s a clip of NBA all-star Steve Nash on a tour of Winston’s studios:For more of Stan Winston’s filmography, click here.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Adventures, Ice","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-The-Best-of-Stan-Winston"},{"id":"47508997726903","title":"Total Recall: Don’t Call It a Comeback","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Don't Call It a ComebackTo celebrate RT's relaunch, we look at some cinematic reclamation projects.by | January 15, 2008 |  CommentsAfter countless hours of brainstorming, research, and exhaustive arguments about color schemes,phase one of the new Rotten Tomatoes is a go! But to be honest, we can’t take much credit for originality: Hollywood’s sordid history is filled with reboots and renewals (not to mentionits fair share of touch-ups, facelifts, nips and/or tucks). In today’s TotalRecall, we invite you to take a look at some intriguing revitalizations within the realm of cinema.These are the people who’ve experienced what Homer Simpson once categorized as the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, and thecreamy middles. But just whatever you do, don’t call it a comeback.Frank SinatraGiven his canonization in the pop culture pantheon, it may be hard for some to believe thatFrank Sinatra ever stumbled. But in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Chairman of the Board was down on his luck, suffering from changing tastes in pop music, damaged vocal chords, and appearances in a series of critically reviled and largely forgotten movies. The fact that he left his wife forAva Gardner didn’t help matters, either; what’s relatively commonplace in these tabloid times was a big scandal back in the day. However, lobbying hard for a part in 1953’s From Here to Eternity (88 percent) paid off big-time. With the success of the WWII drama, Ol’ Blue Eyes was back, picking up an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and reviving his singing career as well. In the ensuing years, he would reel off moody, assured records like In the Wee Small Hours and Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely, and star in such cinematic classics as The Manchurian Candidate (100 percent). (Note to fans of The Godfather: there’s no evidence that Frank got the part with the help of a well-placed horse head.)The Manchurian Candidate trailer.The Quentin Tarantino playersHere’s a tip for talented actors or actresses who are in the midst of a career slump:Quentin Tarantino can definitely help. QT sure knows how to plug stars on the wane — or off-the-radar character actors — into choice roles and exploit their talents to the fullest. The film thatcatapulted the indie auteur onto the map, Pulp Fiction (96 percent) also rescuedJohn Travolta from a notorious dry period and reminded the world thatBruce Willis was capable of making movies worth attending. (Remember, they were both in Look Who’s Talking Too.) Jackie Brown (85 percent) revived the career of blaxploitation’s It GirlPam Grier, as well as that of noted character actorRobert Forster. Kill Bill (both 85 percent) was practically a two-part reclamation project, featuringDaryl Hannah,David Carradine,Michael Parks, andSonny Chiba, among others. If you’re the agent for an ice-cold fading star with skills, it’d probably be in your best interest to lobby heavily for them to appear in Inglorious Bastards.Jackie Brown: natural high.ZombiesAfter the 1970s heyday of the dead, zombies looked down for the count:George A. Romero had moved on to other blood-soaked pastures after Day of the Dead failed to do big business, while near-weekly Italian splatterfests were becoming a thing of the past. But fast forward to 2002, the year zombies took back the cinema.Paul W.S. Anderson released Resident Evil,not only making it the first mainstream zombie success in a long time, but alsoone of the first video game adaptation successes since, well, Anderson’s Mortal Kombat. Also playing in 2002: Danny Boyle’s stylish lo-fi horror flick, 28 Days Later, which didn’t have classic zombies (they ran, they talked, and, man, theywere not happy), but the movie was also an international hit, enough to proclaim zombies effectively risen from their graves. The subsequent success of the Dawn of the Dead remake, Shaun of the Dead, Land of the Dead, and the final two Resident Evil movies further cemented that notion.Shaun of the Dead in five minutes.Neil Patrick HarrisOn the surface,Neil Patrick Harris‘s return flight to fame isn’t different from other 1980s stars who’ve made a killing portraying themselves. But rather than follow his peers setting up lazily narcissistic reality shows, the former teenage M.D. went for broke with a profane, drug-addled pervert version of Neil Patrick Harris in Harold and Kumar GoTo White Castle. After unleashing a bevy of potent quotables that we can’t reprint here (though we know they’re now unfurling across your mind like wisdom-filled cookie fortunes), Harris jumped to a co-starring role in CBS’s How I Met Your Mother as the coolly lecherous womanizer, Barney Stinson. Harris has efficiently dismantled his previous goody-two-shoes image without coming off as desperate or vainglorious, and with the image of him straddling a unicorn on the Harold and KumarEscape from Guantanamo Bay poster currently pasted across multiplex America, the good times continue to roll.Doogie Howser M.D.: alternate opening.BatmanFine, technically the Batman series has rebooted twice. But we’re taking into considerationthat it’s only ironists who likethe Adam West era and that most readers’ experience with The Bat beganby way of Tim Burton. In 1989, Burton did what nobody else could hitherto: attract big stars to a movie that treated its comic origins (fairly) seriously and could break the box office bank. OnceJoel Schumacher took over with 1995’s Batman Forever, he edged a little camp humor in before infamously imploding the series with Batman and Robin‘s one-liners and slack irony. The license looked dead untilChristopher Nolan took over in 2005. Batman Begins gave fans exactly what they had been clamoring for decades: a Bruce Wayne with both presence and humility (Christian Bale) in a movie that’s dark, atmospheric, yet tethered within a world we recognize as our own.The Dark Knight trailer.And now, we leave you with the immortal words of James Todd Smith:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"anime, Nickelodeon, harry, Awards, shows, comedy, Valentine's, furious, your, parents, zero","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Dont-Call-It-a-Comeback"},{"id":"47508996295349","title":"Total Recall: The Eyes Have It","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: The Eyes Have ItFeast your corneas on this collection of cinematic retinal candy!by RT Staff | January 30, 2008 |  CommentsThis week,JessicaAlba stars in TheEye, a spooky tale of a blind woman who gets surgery to restore hersight — and ends up seeing lots of creepy stuff. Thus, we at Rotten Tomatoesthought it would be a great time to peep some classic movies and scenes devotedto the ol peepers.The eyes are the first physical feature people notice oneach other, but in the movies, they’re probably the last. Unless you’reKubrickand partly base your artistic legacy on visual motifs of the organ, the eyesget lost in a medium that relies on dialogue and an actor’s mannerisms and ticsto tell the story. With this list, we set out to catalogue the movies that makethe most of these windows into our souls, which spiraled into a compendium ofeye-gouging. Enjoy! (And if you’re having a snack, consider finishing up rightnow.)Minority Report (91percent on the Tomatometer)Being a fugitive is hard in 2054, especially when your eyesare being scanned at every corner. In a deliciously creepy scene, Officer JohnAnderton (Tom Cruise) finds a black market surgeon (played by a very shadyPeter Stormare) willing to perform an eye transplant. There is a lovelyClockwork Orange-esque eye clamp to make viewers squirm.After the procedure, some seriously scary robot spiders crawl into theapartment, and force Anderton to open his new eyes before they’ve had a chanceto heal. He wants to keep his old eyes, and later drops them and clumsilychases after them as they roll towards the sewer, catching directorStevenSpielberg in a rare moment of mordant humor.Un Chien Andalou (100percent)Perhaps it was the Pixies who best described the essentialappeal of Un Chien Andalou in \"Debaser\":\"Got me a movie!I want you to know!Slicin’ up eyeballs!I want you to know!\"Luis Bunuel andSalvador Dali‘s 1929 surrealist masterpieceis much more than that of course; Un Chien Andalou isprobably the most famous and influential avant-garde film, a full-bore assaulton reason and convention. However, one of the primary reasons for its lastinginfluence is its shocking, notorious opening scene, in which a man takes arazorblade to a woman’s eye. (If it makes you feel any better, a cow’s eye wasused for the scene. And yes, the cow was dead.)Kill Bill: Volume Two (85percent)The two volumes of Kill Bill demonstratethe many ways that the human body can be beaten, sliced, diced, and skewered —not to mention buried alive. However, eyesight damage is also a significantrisk in Quentin Tarantino‘s epic. Case in point: as Elle Driver,Daryl Hannahsuffers not one, but two debilitating retinal injuries. The first is at thehands of martial arts master Pai Mei (who Driver later poisons) leaving herwith a pretty awesome looking eye patch. And the second? We won’t ruin it for you;just watch the clip below (unless you’re squeamish, of course).Zombi 2 (33 percent)Aside from that sublime scene of a zombie boxing a shark atthe bottom of the ocean,Lucio Fulci‘s Zombi 2 is largelyremembered for one scene, occurring after the undead outbreak is in full swing.An unlucky lady gets zombie ambushed and her head is grabbed and guidedsl-o-o-o-wly towards a protruding pointy stick. Rather graphic, profoundly campy,and about as gut-wrenching as whenthe evil security guard gets steamrolled in Austin Powers.Thriller: ACruel PictureTo get banned in the progressive stronghold of Sweden, ittakes only a movie of rampant misogyny, misanthropy, violence, vengeancekillings, hardcore sex, and cadaver misappropriation. Its clear influence onKill Bill spurred renewed interest in the movie, andThriller: A Cruel Picture (aka They Call Her OneEye) has emerged as a hallmark of exploitation cinema, not only forits extreme content but also directorBo ArneVibenus‘s commitment to producecompelling angles and shots amidst the carnage. An actual recently deceasedyoung woman was used for the film’s literally eye-popping scene.Pan’s Labyrinth (96percent)This Spanish fairy tale explores how a child’s imaginationcan be a creative escape during war. A more memorable scene in Pan’sLabyrinth features one of the most repulsive and frightening monstersin recent movie history. Our hero, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), is required tocomplete a task in a dining room filled with delicious food. At the head of thedining room table sits an extremely pale and skeletal creature missing both hiseyes. Conveniently, his sticky bloody eyes sit on a plate in front of him.Ofelia is about to complete her task, when she disobeys the strict orders notto eat any of the food in room. Suddenly, the creature inserts his eyes intohis hands (literally, in the center of his palms) and begins to chase Ofelia.Eyes Without a Face (97percent)A mad scientist, guilt-racked over his daughter’s facialdisfigurement that has led her to permanently wear an ivory mask, kidnaps youngwomen and cuts off their faces to graft onto his daughter. Grotesque butweirdly lyrical, Eyes Without a Face is part of the schoolof elegant horror that these days only the Spanish seem capable of re-creating.The camera’s steady, unflinching gaze (clearly coming from directorGeorges Franju‘s documentarian background) ratchets the story to rather uncomfortablelevels, with the film’s infamous surgery scene causing audiences to faintduring its 1960 premiere.Mansion of the DoomedWhile Eyes Without a Face aimed toelevate horror into misshapen art, 1976’s Mansion of theDoomed gets down and dirty in the B-movie trenches.Mansion takes the plot of the former (insane scientistfather, car accident, disfigured daughter), but with a small twist: instead offace skin, people are being abducted for their eyes. Upstairs in the mansion,it’s all polyester sweater vests and station wagons, but downstairs its hush-hushsurgery (shot in the same clinical manner of Franju’s) and medieval cages ofblinded prisoners screaming and groping around. Appearances always have beendeceiving.Sylvester Stallone,Gary Busey,MarjaneSatarapiWhat do the Italian Stallion, a belovedHollywoodkook, and an Iranian comic artist-cum-filmmaker have in common? Eye of thetiger, baby. Eye of the tiger. Survivor was commissioned to write the hard rockanthem for one of RockyIII‘s many splendored montages, and the song was later appropriated in1986 for Busey’s motorcyclists-on-a-rampage movie,Eye of the Tiger. Countless movies have employed it since,but the best usage in recent memory is Persepolis.Marjane, depressed and ill, retakes the reigns of her life to this tune, whichChiara Mastroianni charmingly warbles off-key.TheLord of the Rings trilogy (94percent)Fewer things are creepier than Orcs, but Sauron’s\"probing\" eye gives most irksome villainy a run for their money.Decidedly more macho than other omniscient phantoms of any of the other worlds(e.g. Macbeth’s Witches, Satan, Mary Alice on DesperateHousewives), Sauron’s disembodied eye is a beacon of evil, darklylording over colonies of shadowy, evildoing loyalists. J.R.R. Tolkien was hoton the trail of effective imagery when he conceived of this eye.

Helmed by veteran rom-com director&nbsp;Andy Tennant&nbsp;(Ever After, Hitch), this&nbsp;fortune-seeking adventure reunites&nbsp;Matthew&nbsp;McConaughey and&nbsp;Kate Hudson,&nbsp;who starred together in 2003’s How toLose a Guy in 10 Days (42 percent).&nbsp; Critics so far haven’t embraced the&nbsp;perfectly bronzed duo’s efforts to retrieve sunken treasure, but if Fool’s&nbsp;Gold turns out to be a diamond in the rough, it would be a pretty silver&nbsp;lining to look forward to.&nbsp; Too much bling for one sentence?&nbsp; Nah…This week we’ll be looking at three films that provide&nbsp;three unique perspectives on the familiar theme of treasure hunting.&nbsp; Typically&nbsp;characterized by swashbuckling heroes, exotic locales, and an element of&nbsp;mystery, these adventures tend to have a high fun factor and, even at their&nbsp;weakest, succeed at least in appealing to our natural curiosity.Back in 1981,&nbsp;Steven Spielberg and George Lucas introduced the world to&nbsp;Indiana Jones,&nbsp;archaeology professor by day and retriever of precious artifacts on holiday&nbsp;weekends.&nbsp; It rocked the box office and spawned a number of clones, including a&nbsp;couple of Allan Quatermain flicks, both National Treasure&nbsp;films, the Mummy series, and even a pair of original Turner&nbsp;Network movies about a librarian.&nbsp; But one of the first successful copies&nbsp;was a comedic romp through Colombia called Romancing theStone (84 percent), directed by&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;Zemeckis.The story&nbsp;is relatively straightforward: romance novel&nbsp;writer Joan Wilder’s (Kathleen&nbsp;Turner) sister gets into trouble with some unsavory Colombians, and on her&nbsp;way to exchange a treasure map for her sister, the timid author meets Jack T.&nbsp;Colton (Michael&nbsp;Douglas), recluse-cum-aviculturist-cum-fortune finder.&nbsp; Colton and Wilder&nbsp;butt heads (and ultimately bump uglies) as they follow the map to a giant&nbsp;emerald, fleeing competing parties all the way.If you’re popping in Romancing for the first time,&nbsp;it may initially feel a bit&nbsp;dated.&nbsp; The music, the canned gunshots, the&nbsp;wardrobe; all of it is distinctly and unabashedly stuck in the 1980s.&nbsp; The production&nbsp;is big and bold, from the over-the-top silliness to Michael Douglas’s forehead,&nbsp;and the clichés will come at you so fast, you’ll hardly detect the smell of&nbsp;cheese before a hulking slab of cinematic Velveeta floors you with a blow to&nbsp;your aesthetic sensibilities.&nbsp; But stick with it, and you’ll come to realize&nbsp;that this is part of the fun of the movie, which never takes itself too&nbsp;seriously in its efforts to entertain.&nbsp; Turner and Douglas work well on screen&nbsp;together, and there are twists, turns, pitfalls, chases, and explosions aplenty&nbsp;to qualify it as a solid adventure flick.&nbsp; As Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com&nbsp;wrote, “Few films that have arrived since have captured Stone’s&nbsp;enthusiasm and good-naturedness.”Take the wayback machine 20 years earlier and you’ll&nbsp;stumble upon the time of the Spaghetti Western, consisting of classic western&nbsp;films that were produced by Italian studios (who could have reckoned that?).&nbsp;Sergio Leone&nbsp;was the undisputed king of the genre, working repeatedly with Clint Eastwood,&nbsp;and the two of them in 1966 brought us The Good,&nbsp;the Bad and the Ugly (100 percent), now considered not only a&nbsp;monumental achievement in the western genre, but also one of the most&nbsp;influential films ever made.The concept of treasure hunting isn’t foreign to westerns,&nbsp;be it in the form of tracking bounties, panning for gold, or gallivanting around&nbsp;in your average X-marks-the-spot caper. &nbsp;More the latter of the three but far&nbsp;from “average,” the story here involves The Man With No Name (Clint&nbsp;Eastwood, the “Good”), Angel Eyes (Lee&nbsp;Van Cleef, the “Bad”), and Tuco (Eli&nbsp;Wallach, the “Ugly”), three Civil War-era gunslingers who distrust each other&nbsp;but must work together to secure a buried cache of stolen Confederate gold.&nbsp;When the opening credits roll, you’ll immediately recognize the film’s score;&nbsp;it’s the same coyote-like melody synonymous with western duels, whether found in&nbsp;Looney Toons shorts or ads for weedkiller, and it’s indicative of exactly howinfluential The Good, the Bad and the Ugly has been.Leone takes his time crafting each of the characters and&nbsp;their relationships, and the resulting tension is thick, sweaty, and unnerving,&nbsp;much like I am on a typical day.&nbsp; But he also throws in some comic elements,&nbsp;mostly at the expense of Tuco, and effectively intertwines the backdrop of the&nbsp;Civil War to move the story along.&nbsp; The race to the prize culminates in a&nbsp;Mexican standoff (before they became cliché), and Leone doesn’t disappoint with&nbsp;the outcome.&nbsp; The film is a classic and highly watchable for western buffs and&nbsp;movie lovers alike; as Michael Wilmington wrote for the Chicago Tribune, it is “an improbable masterpiece — a bizarre mixture of&nbsp;grandly operatic visuals, grim brutality and sordid violence that keeps&nbsp;wrenching you from one extreme to the other.”Lastly, we jump back to the&nbsp;1980s, when Monty Python alumnus&nbsp;Terry Gilliam&nbsp;put a creative yet bizarre twist on the traditional treasure hunt.&nbsp; Forget the&nbsp;tumbleweeds and corrals, screw the pirate ships and wooden chests; when Terry&nbsp;Gilliam creates a sprawling adventure, it sprawls across space and time.&nbsp; At&nbsp;least, that’s what he did with 1982’s Time Bandits(94 percent), the first of three highly imaginative and visually remarkable&nbsp;films Gilliam made in the era, the other two being Brazil (97&nbsp;percent) and The&nbsp;Adventures of Baron Munchausen (86 percent).Time Bandits’ plot: dwarf&nbsp;thieves who zip through time and loot some of&nbsp;history’s greatest figures.&nbsp; The aforementioned dwarves, employed by a&nbsp;“Supreme Being,” are commissioned to repair various holes in the fabric of time,&nbsp;utilizing a unique map of the universe.&nbsp; Due to a labor dispute, however, the&nbsp;dwarves decide to use the map to their own advantage, picking up a child&nbsp;companion along the way and jumping through time to rob the likes of Napoleon (Ian&nbsp;Holm) and King Agamemnon (Sean&nbsp;Connery).&nbsp; Enter the embodiment of Evil (David&nbsp;Warner), who wants the power of the map to recreate the world, and pretty&nbsp;soon you’ve got man-pigs running around and ogres with back problems trying to&nbsp;devour our anti-heroes.If nothing else, this movie is a fun ride because it offers&nbsp;a glimpse into the bizarre mind of Gilliam himself, who also co-wrote the film.&nbsp;The scenes are often awkward but hilarious, and with further cameos from a young&nbsp;Jim Broadbent&nbsp;and other Monty Python members, it definitely delivers on its promise of pure&nbsp;gold. “For a kids film this is pleasingly dark with Gilliam delivering as muchclassical fairy tale as knockabout comedy,” wrote Ian Freer of Empire Magazine.&nbsp;The promise of instant wealth and the power of greed always&nbsp;make for compelling stories, and when the objects of said greed are (in)conveniently&nbsp;located at the furthest reaches of the planet (and time), you not only have a&nbsp;compelling story, you’ve probably also got&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty entertaining movie.&nbsp; For more&nbsp;takes on adventuresome endeavors, see The&nbsp;Treasure of the Sierra Madre (100 percent), The Goonies (63&nbsp;percent), the Pirates of the Caribbean films, and for some deliciously bad fun, Firewalker (zero&nbsp;percent).","section":"Total Recall","tags":"razzies, live, comiccon, animated, story, kids, Skip, directors, police, cancelled, Creative","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/RomancingStoneOld.jpg","slug":"total-recall-a-treasure-trove-of-cinematic-gold"},{"id":"47508996297398","title":"Total Recall: Journey to the Center of Rambo","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Journey to the Center of RamboSee how RT's resident chick flick expert tears through the first three Rambo movies.by Rachel Sandor | January 23, 2008 |  CommentsThis week, SlyStallone revives one of his most iconic characters. In Rambo, John Rambois back, after a short twenty year break. Living a solitary life as ariver guide in Thailand, he discovers recent clients have been captured in Burmaand decides to take matters into his own hands and straps the bandana back on.The Rambo films are now a staple in 80s pop culture, so RT decided totake a trip back to the 80s, and watch the original three Rambo films forthis week’s Total Recall.I’ll be the firstto admit that I’m not the biggest fan of violent movies; in fact, I’ve somehowmanaged to make it this far in life without seeing any of the approximately4,000 Terminator, Predator, or Alien films. The onlySchwarzenegger or Stallone action I’ve seen has been of the Stop! or My MomWill Shoot or Junior variety, and rather than seeing Cloverfieldlast weekend, you would have caught me at the 27 Dressesscreening. So some of the editors hereat Rotten Tomatoes thought it would be a hoot to give me a Rambo-centricassignment. This is how, in my mid-twenties, I finally swallowed a time capsuleof the 1980s action phenomenon, and watched all three Rambo films in oneblood-drenched, guerilla warfare-filled weekend.I began my Rambo-thonwith the first film to feature John Rambo, First Blood (82 percent on theTomatometer). Unlike the plotless bloodbath I was expecting, First Bloodis the tale of a Vietnam War hero who clashes with a small-town cop (played byBrian Dennehy). The cop — who clearly has a problem with Vietnam veterans —spots a drifter (Stallone, natch) walking through his peaceful Oregon town, anddecides to bust him on a bogus charge. Bad move, Dennehy! While beinginterrogated and treated like livestock at the station, Rambo has flashbacks ofbeing abused as a POW in Vietnam, and all hell breaks loose. The remainder ofthe film is an exhilarating chase through the primal wildlife of the PacificNorthwest. Sly has some decent acting chops in the film, with the exception ofhis final monologue — which I needed to watch with subtitles to fullyunderstand.Besides being agreat \"on-the-run\" action flick, First Blood dramatizes many issuesVietnam veterans faced upon their return to America. But while actual Vietnamveterans had to fight their own personal wars after returning home, all Ramboneeds to take on an entire police force is a ragged tarp and a novelty-sizedhunting knife. Critics still hail First Blood today: Phil Villarreal ofthe Arizona Daily Star says, \"Stallone’s dogged tale of survival seems sofresh you’d swear it was made last week…except for the sad truth that they don’tmake ’em like that anymore.\"First Blood trailer.After my surprisepositive reaction to First Blood, I was looking forward to watching Rambo:First Blood Part II (26 percent). The movie starts interestingly enough —Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), who trained Rambo, asks him to go to Vietnamto photograph American POWs — but after arriving in Vietnam, Rambo realizes thathe’s been set up, and vows to rescue the prisoners. Sounds good, right? Ithought so too, until Rambo strangled a rattlesnake in the jungle within thefirst 10 minutes of the film. Throughout the jungle scenes, Rambo brutally killsa lot of animals, shrubbery, and people — including pirates — with his eerilyveiny bare hands.&nbsp; &nbsp;I definitely knew the movie was trouble when I noticed Sly’ssuspicious muscle gain — he looks like he devoured a few cases of human growthhormones before the cameras rolled — and after a few minutes of dialogue and afew lame attempts at political discussion, the filmmakers decide to ditch theideas and just blow stuff up instead. Filmcritic.com’s Jeremiah Kipp agrees.\"Noone will ever confuse this for a quality film, that’s for sure. It’s a machofantasy created to convince Americans that we could have wonVietnamif only we’d trusted John Rambo.\" Rambo can do anything in this sequel. Itdoesn’t matter if hundreds of people are after him; all he needs is his machinegun. Rambowas killing so many people at once that it reminded me of Hot Shots. Theproblem with the second Rambo is that it takes itself too seriously; ifit had just embraced its cheesiness, it’d have been much more entertaining.Rambo – First Blood Part II trailer.After the trashthat was Rambo II, I wasn’t looking forward to devoting further hours toRambo III (35 percent), but surprisingly, the third installment is a great combination of First Blood‘s good qualities and the tongue-in-cheek factor that Part II was missing. In Rambo III, we find Stallone living in a monastery,helping out the monks with his carpentry skills and income from stick-fightingmatches (mmm…cheese). The colonel manages to track Rambo down in Thailand and —surprise! — asks him to join his team on a mission in Afghanistan. (It seems that an evil Russian commander is brutalizing a small Afghan village.) Rambo politely declines, since he’s busy working on himself, butquickly changes his mind after learning that Trautman went in and has beencaptured. The scenes with Rambo interacting with the Afghan rebels show a softerside of the action hero, and teach a bit of history about the various Afghanoccupations.However, onceRambo decides to go in and save Trautman on a solo mission, the film I wasexpecting all along finally appears. With his bandana tied tight, Rambo shootshundreds of Russians, defeats helicopters and tanks with a single gun, andmanages to get in some great dialogue about being the Soviet commander’s \"worstnightmare.\" I especially enjoyed Rambo running through a giant explosion in acave — when Colonel Trautman asks how he feels, a burnt Rambo replies, \"Welldone.\" Despite some negative reviews — and the ridiculous plot — I had a lotof fun watching Rambo III. \"Stallone has by now made Rambo parody-proof,since the character is every bit as laughable as he is grandiose; that’s part ofthe fun,\" wrote Janet Maslin of the New York Times.&nbsp;Rambo III trailer.The Rambo films were all entertaining in their own ways, and the violencewas fairly predictable, so it was easy for me to close my eyes whenever Rambowas performing self-surgery or slicing someone open. I’m even not- so-secretlyexcited to see the new Rambo. Here’s hoping it combines the politicalundercurrent of First Blood with the cheesy puns and overall badassnessof Rambo III.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"LGBT, play, Academy, america, Family, Marathons, guild, Purge, show, Oscars, Baby, books, docudrama, Rom-Com","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Journey-to-the-Center-of-Rambo"},{"id":"47508997738172","title":"Total Recall: I Am Legend and the Work of Richard Matheson","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: I Am Legend and the Work of Richard MathesonWe examine the film work of the cult novelist/screenwriter.by | December 12, 2007 |  CommentsThis week, Will Smith plays a guy who discovers he’s the last man on earth in I Am Legend. So it’s a good time to take a look at the movie work of Richard Matheson, who penned the film’s source material.Among sci-fi/thriller writers whose work has been adapted for the screen, Matheson’s name is less familiar than Stephen King‘s or Philip K. Dick‘s. But his novels and screenplays have cast a long shadow over the pulp medium. Like King, Matheson tells stories of regular people who find themselves in extraordinary situations. Though his novelization of I Am Legend has been made into a movie several times (as 1964’s The Last Man on Earth [91 percent] and 1971’s The Omega Man [62 percent]) and is probably his best-known work, Matheson has shown an aptitude for twisty horror, thoughtful sci-fi, and sweeping romance.Duel (81 percent) is a perfect example of one of Matheson’s greatest strengths: The image of one man gradually coming to grips with inexplicable horror. While Terror at 20,000 Feet is docked points since it’s only a short (part of The Twilight Zone movie, 63 percent) and the details of I am Legend are always drastically changed for film, Duel remains as taut and efficient as it originally was in 1971. Representing Steven Spielberg‘s feature-length directorial debut, the film follows a traveling businessman (Dennis Weaver) who’s relentlessly pursued by a big rig and its never-seen driver. “Even without benefit of hindsight,” writes Janet Maslin of The New York Times, “Duel looks like the work of an unusually talented young director.”Duel was made for the ABC network on a 10-day shooting schedule, but its success as a Sunday Movie of the Week prompted its theatrical release overseas, along with a limited run in the U.S. Spielberg shot three new sequences: the scene where Weaver tries to assist a stuck school bus as the big rig slowly creeps up on him, an equally compelling scene that has Weaver’s car slowly being nudged into an oncoming train, and one that has Weaver calling his family before being terrorized. The last scene is interesting for a few reasons. For one, it shows a strong father figure before Spielberg’s cynicism toward them crept into his work. And the scene’s sentimentality actually helps the movie overall: it grounds Weaver’s character into reality, in a movie that is otherwise a frightening existential pursuit across the California outback.Duel theatrical trailerAfter the considerable success the dramatic Robin Williams experienced in Good Will Hunting, Williams seemed determined to re-invent himself as dramedian at the end of the century. 1999’s Jakob the Liar was a box office bomb, along with Bicentennial Man and 1998’s What Dreams May Come (56 percent), though the latter two couldn’t be faulted for lacking ambition. Bicentennial Man plots out a robot’s 200-year long journey to become human, while What Dreams May Come is a metaphysical drama about a man who leaves Heaven and plumbs the depths of Hell to retrieve his recently deceased wife. Based on the Matheson novel of the same name, Williams overacts a bit (that’s what happens when Williams does drama without a beard), but the movie’s worth watching for its Oscar-winning depiction of Heaven. “[It’s] like an abstract painting,” Karen Hershenson of the Contra Costa Times writes about the film. “Full of vivid brushstrokes that hint at deeper meaning.”Matheson has a long-standing reputation as a thinking man’s Stephen King, but he did occasionally dip into romantic melodrama. Along with What Dreams May Come, 1981’s Somewhere in Time (60 percent) is an odd romance starring Christopher Reeve who travels back in time to get it on with Jane Seymour. Adapted by Matheson from his novel, he writes “Somewhere in Time is the story of a love which transcends time, What Dreams May Come is the story of a love which transcends death. I feel that they represent the best writing I have done in the novel form.”Scene from What Dreams May ComeMatheson’s work has also blended everyday life with the supernatural to disquieting effect; an excellent example is the underrated Stir of Echoes (69 percent). This ghost story, based upon Matheson’s 1958 novel, had the misfortune of being released around the same time as, and sharing similar elements with, The Sixth Sense, but it stands on its own as a creepy, achingly poignant document of a solid, average guy’s descent into madness. Kevin Bacon plays Tom, a phone company employee and amateur musician, who’s not very happy with the routine his life has fallen into. On a lark at a neighborhood party, Tom convinces his sister-in-law (Illeana Douglas) to hypnotize him. Soon after, he experiences a series of troubling visions: the spectral presence of a teenage girl seems to be trying to communicate with him, and he finds he has strange powers that help him tap into the spirit world. Even more disturbing is the fact that his young son seems to be experiencing the same things with even greater clarity. As Tom pieces things together, he discovers the spirits may be giving him the clues to solving a murder.Some of the Echoes‘ supernatural elements may not tie together seamlessly, and the ending doesn’t quite do justice to the deliciously sharp setup. But Stir of Echoes is still worlds richer than many horror flicks. It draws much of its power from its well-developed sense of place; one gets the sense that the characters have lived on the same block and breathed the same air for a long time, which adds heft to the horrifying things taking place around them. There are a number of seemingly mundane moments that throb with an undercurrent of terror. And Bacon is excellent as a decent family man who has become obsessed with the strange visions in his head. “Stir of Echoes gives a classic ghost story extra zip by insisting on the reality of the characters and their place,” wrote Susan Stark of the Detroit News.Scene from Stir of Echoes","section":"Total Recall","tags":"News, Disney+, YouTube, HBO, Discovery, dogs, Emmy, rotten, chucky, e., hollywood","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-I-Am-Legend-and-the-Work-of-Richard-Matheson"},{"id":"47508997748418","title":"Total Recall: American Gangster‘s Paradise","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: American Gangster's ParadiseRe-discovering the cinema of organized crime.by RT Staff | October 31, 2007 |  CommentsThis week,Ridley Scott‘s American Gangster starringRussell Crowe andDenzel Washington hits theaters. With its story of a drugkingpin and the cop who’s trying to take him down, we at Rotten Tomatoes thoughtit would be a good time to delve into some flicks about organized crime you mayhave missed.Organized crime figures have long been some of cinema’sgreatest antiheros. Since the earliest days of sound, gangsters have appealed tothe dark side of audiences, especially since the bad guys are more colorful,witty, and beholden to codes of honor than the milquetoast “good guys.” Somefilms (most notably The Godfather, 100 percent on the Tomatometer) havehad a profound influence on the public’s ideas of the mafia (and mobstersthemselves).From the 1910s to the 1920s, \"swiped from theheadlines\" crime dramas were huge. Scandalous to audiences and censors, thesesalacious two and three reel films exposed the plight of pushers, bootleggersand sex slaves without the banner of the \"newsreel\" to redeem them. By the soundera, crime dramas didn’t rely as extensively on the framework of \"true stories\"but did sometimes justify their graphic content with socially cautiousintroductions. William Wellman’s 1931 masterpiece The Public Enemy(100 percent)introduces its story with outright public service. How better to validate thesex, bootlegging and gun fighting than to root it in immigration stress andsocial woe and then ask the audience, \"What will you do about it?\"The Public Enemy balances indignities (remember thefamous grapefruit smashing?) with the ‘business’ of tommy gun stand offs andeven sprinkles the occasional bit of humor into the violence to muddy the moralwaters (amidst gunfire: \"I can’t hear you, can you speak-a up?\"). Wellman’screative use of sound heightens the effects of off-screen sex and violence(listen for the giggling in the bedroom when Tom Powers [James Cagney] tells hislive-in girlfriend \"I wish you was a wishing well \") and the use of screams andgunfire in Power’s famous retribution scene. The Public Enemy is one ofthe best displays of heartbreaking violence you’ll find, so much so that thecensors were stoking coals when this film came out. Though it made overturestoward a socially redeeming message, the graphic brutality and overt sexualcharge of The Public Enemy would be one of many factors in theestablishment of the1934 Production Code. \"James Cagney’s portrayal of abootlegging runt is truly electrifying, and Jean Harlow makes the tartiest tartimaginable,\" wrote Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader.As the decades progressed, the French also carved out their niche in the genre. DirectorJules Dassin was one of the hundreds of namednames during the Hollywood blacklist. Dassin — who had directed classic noirslike The Naked City(92 percent) and Brute Force(80 percent) by time he was routed — was only briefly amember of the Communist Party, but enough to send him into French exile. But youknow how international directors usually do their worst work when they start working in Hollywood?&nbsp; Reversing the formula also seems to work: likeWoody Allen, Dassin’s permanent foreign vacation got him to produce one of his best features.1955’s Rififi(92 percent), about a newly released jailbird who re-enters the crime world topull of a jewel heist, is a crackerjack thriller. Elegantly shot in blackand white and with compelling performances, Kenneth Turan of the Los AngelesTimes calls Rififi, \"[o]ne of the great crime thrillers, the benchmark allsucceeding heist films have been measured against.\"And now, a moment of silence. Or several hundred moments ofsilence. The legendary centerpiece of Rififi is the jewel heist segment, a completelywordless, music-free caper that ingeniously turns ordinary objects into tools ofthe criminal trade. It’s one of the most nail-biting 30 minutes captured on film.With action segments now largely driven by stylish edits and speaker-blowingsound effects and music, Rififi‘s intensely intimate silence speaksvolumes.As the times change, so do crime movies. It’s nowcommonplace to find crime dramas with hip hop soundtracks, but when New JackCity (79 percent) was first released in 1991, such cross-promotion wasnothing short of revelatory. It didn’t hurt that the movie itself was a sharpneo-noir packed with grit and electricity. In his feature directorial debut,Mario Van Peebles simultaneously borrowed from such gangster touchstones as Scarfaceand The Godfather while updating the streetwise blaxploitation classicsof the 1970s (Shaft, Superfly, his father’s Sweet Sweetback)and adding a dash of quasi-history to the mix as well. Drug lord Nino Brown(Wesley Snipes) is loosely based upon Nicky Barnes (the subject of the recentdoc Mr. Untouchable, 63 percent); he runs New York’s most dominant drugorganization, converting an apartment complex into a thriving crackhouse. Thepolice make it a priority to infiltrate Nino’s organization, with an undercovercop (Ice-T) and a reformed drug addict (Chris Rock) enlisted for the task.New Jack City has a few problems, most notably itsludicrous ending. But the film boasts a number of excellent performances: Snipesis malevolently effective as the brilliant but amoral Nino;Ice-T andJuddNelson smartly transcend cliché as cops who don’t like each other but share alevel of mutual respect; and Rock, in a rare dramatic role, is spellbinding as arecovering crackhead, full of desperate energy and gallows humor. “Theperformances are stoked with hyperbolic verve,” wrote Hal Hinson in the WashingtonPost. “The actors all seem to have hooked into the pure, concentrated heartof their characters, and while their emotions are big, there’s no emptystrutting in them — they’re street-operatic.”There are a multitude of cinematic roads to Gangland; filmsas varied as Little Caesar (84 percent), Bob Le Flambeur (96percent), Deep Cover (84 percent), Donnie Brasco (85 percent), andCity of God (92 percent) have allowed audience to infiltrate organizedcrime, and reap illicit thrills in the process.Authors: Sara Schieron, Alex Vo, and Tim Ryan.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"lee, comic, Network, period, GLAAD, robots, technology, dragons, MSNBC, YouTube","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-American-Gangsters-Paradise"},{"id":"47508997751492","title":"Total Recall: Ben (Affleck’s) Bits","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Is it better to change the system from the inside, as Cooke says, or is the system itself the thing that needs to change, as X argues. Reviews of the film, which will no doubt be a big player this awards season, have heralded King’s skillful translation of Kemp Powers’ play to the big screen, as well as the performances of its four leads: Leslie Odom Jr. (Cooke), Eli Goree (Clay), Aldis Hodge (Brown), and Kingsley Ben Adir (Malcom X). In this exclusive and extended sit down with the four actors, they share how they prepared for and eventually inhabited the larger-than-life figures, from perfecting accents and swagger to transforming physically and digging deep into the ideologies that drove them.On an Apple device?

The years, Stewart says, have changed them both. That growth is central to the newest CBS All Access series Star Trek: Picard, which finds the titular commander in a very different place to when we last saw him – older, wiser, out of the game, and about to be drawn back in.Rotten Tomatoes sat down with Stewart to find out what brought him back to the Star Trek franchise and why he feels such a personal connection with the man who’s become his most iconic role. Plus, we talk to Star Trek newcomers Isa Briones, Alison Pill, Santiago Cabrera, Evan Evagora, and Michelle Hurd, about working with the star and joining the Star Trek universe. Franchise veterans Jeri Ryan, Jonathan Del Arco, and Marina Sirtis reveal what it was like to return.

That film,&nbsp;The Lighthouse, stars Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe as the 19th-century “wickies,” or lighthouse keepers, who find themselves trapped in the titular structure when a mammoth storm hits; released in limited theaters last week, it’s been drumming up big box office receipts and even bigger questions from audiences who’ve seen it.
